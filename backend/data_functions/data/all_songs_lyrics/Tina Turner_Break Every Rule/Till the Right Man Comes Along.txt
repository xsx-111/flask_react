Till the Right Man Comes Along Lyrics
It's time to face the music
Tonight, I came to use it
You never know
Who you're going to  meet in here
I thought I'd never find him
The dark an' handsome kind
I used to dream of
And now you're standing there
Though you're looking good to me
It doesn't mean that you can do as you please
No 

Oh baby, you're the best thing in my life
(But a one track mind is what you got)
Oh baby, you're my best bet here tonight
(And a one track mind is worth a lot)
I've got no good reason to believe we'll last for long
But that`s good enough for me
Until the right man comes along

I've waited for a lover
The kind who`ll stay forever
You look to me
Like the sort of man I need
It's not the best scenario
But now I've found you
I'm not letting you go
Oh 
Oh baby, you're the best find in my life
(But a one track mind is what you got)
Oh baby, you're my best bet here tonight
(And a one track mind is worth a lot)
For the perfect guy, maybe I should be holding on
And with you I could, until the right man
Until the right man comes along

Until the right man comes along, comes along
(And a one track mind is worth a lot)
Baby, you're the best, say you're the best
You're the best thing in my life
(But a one track mind is what you got)Embed
