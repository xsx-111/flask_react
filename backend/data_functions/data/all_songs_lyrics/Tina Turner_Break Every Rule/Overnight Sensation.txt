Overnight Sensation Lyrics
Well, I guess I've been a long time
Working in the back line
Trying to make a song fit
When you know it never was mine

Two dollar high-heel shoes
And a honky tonk dress
In the rhythm and the soul reviews
I had a dream I guess, yeah yes
And I had to beat the stage fright
I had to cry all night
Trying to make a song fit
When you know it never was right
I said, "Girl, get up and
Get out of this mess

You're going to be an overnight sensation
Going to  be an overnight success"

And all through the badlands
Rocking on the bandstands
It's so hard in the bar bands
When there's no one there who understands
Lady luck will pass you by
And she will never say yes
You're going to be an overnight sensation
Going to be an overnight
Going to  be an overnight success

I used to be a sweet little
Rock 'N' Roll singer
Chasing after fortune and fame
What's your story?
What's your payola?
Me, I'm in the music game

Well I guess I've been a long time
Working in a back line
I'm trying to make a song fit
I know it never was mine

Eh, what can I tell you?
I made a break I guess
And now I'm an overnight sensation
Over, overnight
Say I'm an overnight sensation
Over, overnight 
Over, overnight sensation
Over, overnight
Over, overnight sensation
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
