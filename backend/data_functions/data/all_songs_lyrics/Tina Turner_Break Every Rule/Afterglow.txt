Afterglow Lyrics
I need you here beside me
To chase the night away
I need your love to guide me
Safe through another day
I lie and watch the lights go down
Say goodnight to another town
And though it hurts
To be alone
I have my thoughts of you
To keep me warm

In the afterglow of your love
Dreams all I'm guilty of
Everyday I'm playing tough
But read my mind
If you could see me now
Living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
The me that only you would know
Still burning in the afterglow

When the beat of the drum has faded
The show comes to an end
The stage is clear and loaded
And the highway calls again
I stand and watch the lights go down

Hmm hmm
Stay with me right to the end
Hmm hmm
Till I can hold you again
Hmm hmm hmm

If you could see me now
Just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
I'm still burning in the afterglow
(If you could see me now)
Ohh I'm just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now

Still burning 
(If you could see me now)
Just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
I'm still burning in the afterglowEmbed
