Girls Lyrics
Girls, we come and we go
We kiss, come and we go
Like a breeze brushing your cheek
Like pain, like the tears on a face
Girls

Girls, we come and we go
Like spirits, we vanish at dawn
My heart suspended in time
Like you, vanish like tears in the rain

Girls, we take our love away
Like spirits living so far away
Girls, pretending to break down and cry
Girls, whispering wind
Why do we give it away?
We used to be so happy
Remember, remember, so happy
I never knew how lonely
How lonely, how lonely
Could feel

Girls, we come and we go
We kiss, come and we go
Like spirits brushing your cheek
Ooo, like pain, like the tears on a face
Girls, we take our love away
Like spirits living so far away
Girls, pretending to break down and cry
Girls, whispering wind
What are we giving away?
We used to be so happy
Remember, remember, so happy
I never knew how lonely
How lonely, how lonely
Could feel

Yeah ,yeah,yeah...Embed
