Tired of Giving Up Lyrics
I'm tired of giving up so easy
Tired of giving up at all
Tired of giving up so easy
Tired of giving up at all

Nobody said it would be easy
Nobody said nothing at all
And I'm tired of giving up

And I'm tired of fighting
I don't understand at all
And I'm tired of lying
Tired of trying to hide it

Tired of giving up so easy
Tired of giving up at all
Tired of giving up so easy
Tired of giving up at all

Is that all you can say?
You're so wild and full of rage
You keep running away; you're running
Suppose I try to tell you
Something I don't know
Sometimes you know
There ain't no telling you; so I don't

I'm tired of giving up so easy
Tired of giving up at all
Tired of giving up so easy
Tired of giving up at all

Is that all you can say?
You're so wild and full of rage
You keep running away; you're running

You're Running
Running
Running
