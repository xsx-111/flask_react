Feels Like Fire LyricsAre you there?
Screaming in the night
Somewhere
Hanging from the side
Feel the sunlight
The sunlight on my face
It’s cold out here
Lost in outer space
Just so you know
You will always be the hardest thing I will let go
Driving past your church and all the houses in a row
The feeling in my chest is fire
Broken glass and wire
See my smile?
I’m thinking of the days
Light reflecting in your eyes
It was never the same
I wanna lie down
I wanna ride in your car
You can take me anywhere
Roll us into heaven I don’t care
Just so you know
You will always be the hardest thing I will let go
Driving past your church and all the houses in a row
The feeling in my chest is fire
Just so you know
Don’t let anybody tell you
You can’t say
What you want
I can hear you
Are you on your way?
The feeling in my chest is fire
It feels like fire
Broken glass and wire
It feels like fire
I feel a scream
Someplace in my chest
And I pour my thoughts
Down the drain in my head
The lens is broke
There ain’t no one inside
Staring through the screen
Looking back at my fucking life
Just so you know
You will always be the hardest thing I will let go
Driving past your church and all the houses in a row
The feeling in my chest is fire
Just so you know
Don’t let anybody tell you
You can’t say
What you want
I can hear you
Are you on your way?
Someone take me home tonight
It feels like fire
It feels like fire
It feels like fire
Broken glass and wire2Embed
