Gimme Something Good LyricsI can't talk
My mind is so blank
So I'm going for a walk
I got nothing left to say
I can't see
There's a darkness on the rise
I'll be waiting here
Till the end end of time

All my life been shaken
Wanting something
Holding everything I have like it was broken
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
I was playing dead
I didn't make a sound
Holding my breath
Going underground
So I can't talk
I got nothing to say
It's like there's no tomorrow
Barely yesterday

All my life been shaken
Wanting something
Holding everything I have like it was broken
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good oh no

All my life been shaken
Wanting something
Holding everybody back, demanding ransom
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good
Gimme something good oh no2Embed
