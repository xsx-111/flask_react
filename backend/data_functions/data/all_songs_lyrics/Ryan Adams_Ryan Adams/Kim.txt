Kim LyricsI can’t sleep
Can’t go home
Underneath the branches
Of a sycamore tree
On a darkened road
With this key
Scratched into the wall
I spell out your name
It’s fucking with my head
And fucking with my heart

As the autumn leaves begin to fall
Walking down the street
Where you and I would walk
I see him
Kim
Kim
Kim
I can’t sleep
Can’t let go
Underneath my feet it’s miles of nothing
And there’s nowhere to go
With this key
Scratched into my arm
I spell out your name
It’s ringing in my head
Like a false alarm

As the leaves begin to fall and grey
Walking down the street
I watched you walk away
To be with him
Kim
Kim
Kim
Ooo Kim

Like a letter I could never send
Walking down the streets
Where I never walk again
Kim
Kim
Kim
Kim
