My Wrecking Ball Lyrics
Driving through the streets tonight
It's hot, I got the windows down
I wish I could call you, I wish you were still around
Nothing much left in the tank
Somehow this thing still drives
It forgot what it needed, but somehow still survives

And all the walls we built they must come down

Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down?
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight

Lying in the bed at night
Feeling like I'm somebody else
My thoughts inside my head get lost inside the haunted house
Everyone I used to know
Left their dreams by the door
I accidentally kick 'em that's how I can tell you're still not sure
And all the walls we built they rise and they fall

But hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down?
Hey, you're my wrecking ball
Won't you come and knock me down?
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight
Come and knock me down, come and knock me down
Come and knock me down tonight

Driving through the streets tonight
It's hot, I got the windows down
I wish I could call you, I wish you were still around1Embed
