Shadows Lyrics
I fall, in the cutting room
Straight to the floor, before the film is through
Every day in my head, that field of razor wire
Come a little closer, honey
And touch the fire

How long do I have here with you?
The flowers that once were in bloom
Shadows

Heaven waits, in the darkness of a room
And the shaking at the gates
From here to Timbuktu
Cold front rolls in, like a black balloon
And it sinks into your soul
And you tell it what you knew

How long do I have here with you?
How long do I have here with you?
How long?
The flowers that once were in bloom
Are shadows
The mystery of the stars
That fell from your eyes
Watch it as it burns
Like a signal fire
That mountain is tall
And you know you'll have to climb
Put your arms around me
And let's go for a ride

How long do I have here with you?
How long do I have here with you?
How long?
How long?
Before the shadowsEmbed
