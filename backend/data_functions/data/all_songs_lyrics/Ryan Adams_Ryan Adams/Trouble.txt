Trouble Lyrics
Trouble, I hear the clock tick in the room
The walls will crumble
And you're holding the match to the fuse
There's something I thought just got
Nothing else to say
I've been on the repeat since yesterday
There's something loose, either way

Hey, we might as well be dead and be gone
If we don't belong here
Hey, the year and the day
And the lines on my face
Like a map of my sins
Yeah, and all the trouble I'm in
Trouble I'm in

I feel you watch me cross the room
Another summer, in the palms are the color of Doom
Put my hand through the mirror let the water run
Seven years bad luck is better than none
Following the bullet back into the gun
Hey, we might as well be dead and be gone
If we don't belong here
Hey, the year and the day
And the lines on my face
Like a map of my sins
Yeah, and all the trouble I'm in

Umm all the Trouble
Umm, and all the trouble I'm in

I see my brother, he's waiting in line for his turn
I'm not as humble, I know everything here is gonna burn
Sometimes I just got nothing else to say
I've been on the beats since yesterday
There's something loose, either way

Hey, we might as well be dead and be gone
If we don't belong here
Hey, the year and the day
And the lines on my face
Like a map of my sins
Yeah, and all the trouble I'm in
Yeah, all the trouble
Yeah, and all the trouble I'm in
Hey, all the trouble
All the trouble I'm inEmbed
