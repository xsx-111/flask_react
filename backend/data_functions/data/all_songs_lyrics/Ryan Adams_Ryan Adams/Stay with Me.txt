Stay with Me Lyrics
Love, when you call my name
It sends me running into the flame

I love you baby, just treat me right
Hold me closer, in the middle of the night
I love you girl, and it's alright
Stay with me

Are you waiting, are you standing guard?
There's nothing they can steal from us
That isn't always yours

I love you baby, just treat me right
Hold me closer, in the middle of the night
I love you girl, and it's alright
Stay with me

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Like the speed of sound or the speed of light
When you say my name, it feels so right
In the middle of the night, would you call my name
Don't worry, it's okay

I love you baby, just treat me right
Hold me closer, in the middle of the night
I love you girl, and it's alright
Stay with me

Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with meEmbed
