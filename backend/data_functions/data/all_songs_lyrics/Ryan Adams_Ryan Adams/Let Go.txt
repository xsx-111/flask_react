Let Go Lyrics
Pink as a rose the sun is fading
Can you feel the darkness that surrounds the house
Plain as the truth my breath is bated
It pinches like a trap shut around the mouse

But down the road cause we fell in
But down the road
Hanging 'round the wish-it-well
It's a slippery slope
And I let go
Let go
Let go
Let go away

Driving at night beside the river
Looking at as it's going nowhere
Dark as a room with the light shut out
I'm feeling 'round the walls for another way out

But down the road cause we fell in
But down the road
Hanging 'round the wish-it-well
It's a slippery slope
And I let go
Let go
Let go
Let go
Cross your fingers behind your back
And lie
Tell me it's okay if you'll fix everything
Cause I let go

Pink as a rose the sunsets fading
Shattering the light on the oceanside
Standing alone, I am not waiting
Maybe I'm asleep, my heart is paralyzed

Down the road cause we fell in
But down the road
Hanging 'round the wish-it-well
It's a slippery slope
And I let go
Let go
Let go
Let go againEmbed
