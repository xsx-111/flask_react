Skeleton Makes Good Lyrics
There's so many things
To feel and see while you're awake
They're just out of reach, out of grasp, yeah, out of reach
And just as many; maybe more
The minute that you sleep
So I got to throw my preach

Skeleton breath, scorpion blush
I have a crush on your skeleton
Watch out unsuspecting stranger
You'll fall off the log
Headfirst into dreams
End up screaming

This will comb the wolf
And that will comb the fog
What will peen the rain
What will preen the hog
Oh, you mean earth and hell over you
And laugh at your tire tracks if you get up
Skeleton makes goodEmbed
