The Witch Doctor Life Lyrics
When the witch doctor life throws his silent bones
Some are crowned kings while others lose their thrones
When the witch doctor life throws his silent bones
Small 'o' mouths scream and run to mama kangaroo

Insecure pouches wherein hide beggars and drones
And babies and bums and buzzards
Mama crouches and smiles her old useful smile
And ego roars, laughs yesterday's gases
While children and angels gasp
And follow a shepherd on crutches

When the witch doctor life throws his silent bones
Some flee the dream, some turn to stone
And the children sing and the heavens ring
Worn by a shepherd with folded wings
And the bones that sing of silence

When the witch doctor life throws his silent bones
Some are crowned kings while others lose their thrones
When the witch doctor life throws his silent bones
Small 'o' mouths scream and run to mama kangaroo
Insecure pouches wherein hide beggars and drones
And babies and bums and buzzards
When the witch doctor life throws his silent bones
Some flee the dream, some turn to stone
And the children sing and the heavens ring
Worn by a shepherd with folded wings
And the bones that sing of silenceEmbed
