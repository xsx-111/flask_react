Ink Mathematics Lyrics
Ink mathematics, grey mass ecstatics
Noggin elastics, cerebral tatics
Cranium classics, brainium domics
Denizen omics, grey massmatistics

Quantum puree, it's plain to feel, hard to see
Fission antics, abombastics
Death antiques, wrong deductions
Poor instructions, mass destructions
Peace antiques

Singing ink mathematics, hop along with me
Ink mathematics, moon to a flea
Ink mathematics, I breathe black and white
Day and night, grey gymnastics
Ink math-a-ratics, mathfantastics
Ink mathematics, moon to a flea
Ink mathematistics, hop along with me

Ink mathematics, moon to a fleaEmbed
