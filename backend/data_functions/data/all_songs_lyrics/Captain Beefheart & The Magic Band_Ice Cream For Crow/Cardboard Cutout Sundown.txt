Cardboard Cutout Sundown Lyrics
You hardly know a day goes by
In the cardboard cutout sundown

The moon popped up like a gallery duck
Sipped up gold from the sunny cup
And longhorns sawed the buggy grass
And a cowboy blew a harp sitting on his chapped ass
And the prairie flowers didn't look a bit queer
And the stars struck the sand cartwheeled and poked in the prairie
A cactus juice stand the only place the crows couldn't land
The bluebottle flies were as big as the cowboy's eyes
And their buzz was as loud as rattlers
A fire engine red whistle blows raspberries
In a cloud of whipped steam
A tumble weed ran out black patent yarn stinkbug hoops
From above a living mail thriving dot
In perfect sympathy with the cardboard cutout sundown

You hardly know a day goes by
In the cardboard cutout sundownEmbed
