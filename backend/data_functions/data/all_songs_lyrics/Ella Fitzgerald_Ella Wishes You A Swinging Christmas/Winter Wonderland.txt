Winter Wonderland LyricsSleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the blue bird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married ?" We'll say, "No man
But you can do the job when you're in town"
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Are you listenin', snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married ?" We'll say, "No man
You can do the job when you're in town"
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonder, wonderlandEmbed
