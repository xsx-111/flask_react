The Secret of Christmas LyricsIt's not the glow you feel
When snow appears
It's not the Christmas card
You've sent for years
Not the joyful sound
When sleigh bells ring
Or the merry songs
Children sing
The little gift you send
On Christmas day
Will not bring back the friend
You've turned away
So may I suggest, the secret of Christmas
It's not the things you do
At Christmas time but the Christmas things you do
All year throughEmbed
