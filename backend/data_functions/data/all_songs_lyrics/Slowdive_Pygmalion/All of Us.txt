All of Us Lyrics
This whole life
Is all of us
This whole dream
Is all of me
Minnow lies
Inside me now
No one here
Is sure

He is all of us
He is all of us
He is all of us
He is all of us

He looks centuries older
He's of centuries gone
Recognise I need her
I can hold you close

He is all of us
He is all of us
He is all of us
He is all of us4Embed
