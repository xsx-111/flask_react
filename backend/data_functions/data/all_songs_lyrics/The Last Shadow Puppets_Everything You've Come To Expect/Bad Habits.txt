Bad Habits Lyrics
Bad habits
Sick puppy
Thigh high
Knee deep

Do you want to hold hands?
Should we get back down?
Do you want a slow dance?

Should've known, little girl, that you'd do me wrong
Should've known by the way you were showing off
Bad habits, yeah, bad habits, ooh
Bad habits, yeah, bad habits, wow!

Deep trouble
Red lollipop, ahh!
Pale faces, oh, right
Delicious, wow!

Do you want to hold hands?
Should we get back down?
Do you want a slow dance?
Wow!
Bad habits, yeah, bad habits, ooh
Bad habits, yeah, bad habits, wow!
Ah, ah

Should've known, little girl, that you'd do me wrong
Should've known by the way you were showing off
Should've known, little girl, that you'd do me wrong
Should've known by the way you were showing off

Bad habits, yeah, bad habits, ooh
Bad habits, yeah, bad habits, wow!
Bad habits, yeah, bad habits, oh!
Bad habits, oh!, bad habits12Embed
