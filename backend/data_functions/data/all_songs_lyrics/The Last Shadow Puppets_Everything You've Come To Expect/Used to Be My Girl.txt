Used to Be My Girl Lyrics
Colour pictures of re-entry
Voices calling down the hall
I wanted you to know
You’re the only one that bent me
This far out of shape
Don’t make no mistake
I’m a liar, I’m a cheat
A leech, a thief
The outside looks no good and there ain’t nothing underneath
Darling, can’t you see
My heart melted in the heat
My heart melted in the heat like yours

First impressions of the century
Two-way mirror, one-way street
Good cop, bad cop routine
Black-light animal print boogie
Left in a heap
A kiss on either cheek
I’m a phoney, I’m a fake
A fraud, a snake
Gimme all your love so I can fill you up with hate
Girl, I’m in a state
My heart melted yesterday
My heart melted yesterday like yours
The odyssey
Came down kind of hard on me
The here and now so suddenly
Became a different world
Finally I slipped out of reality
It must all be imaginary
She used to be my girl

Used to be my girl
Used to be my girl
Used to be my girl
Used to be my girl9Embed
