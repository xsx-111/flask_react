Dracula Teeth Lyrics
The Railway Arch Confessional
I wrote your name in white emulsion
I drift away with silver faces on display

Wake up in an ice cold sweat and my skin starts to creep
You’re hovering above my bed looking down on me
Haunted house sound effects, Dracula teeth

The lover boy’s last resort
Secretly calls the getaway car
Lucky stars rattle the jaws as the drawing bow

Wake up in an ice cold sweat and my skin starts to creep
You’re hovering above my bed looking down on me
Haunted house sound effects, Dracula teeth

Dracula teeth, lipstick on my pillow via my cheek
The full moon’s glowing yellow and the floorboards creak
C’est horrifique!

Threatening behaviour bounces 'round my mind
Enthusiasm paraphernalia all over the side
(Dracula teeth) Dracula teeth
(Dracula teeth) Pinball machines on mute6Embed
