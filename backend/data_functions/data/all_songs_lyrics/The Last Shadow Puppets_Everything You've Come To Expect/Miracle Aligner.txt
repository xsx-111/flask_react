Miracle Aligner Lyrics
Tell him what you want and
Baby, he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get ‘em, tiger
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Fifty feet tall and revved up too high
All of our exchanges are by candlelight, I just realised
He’ll walk through the walls and creep up behind
Make sense of the maze that you were stuck outside
Cover your eyes

Often the humble kind but he can’t deny
He was born to blow your mind
Or something along those lines tonight

Tell him what you want and
Baby, he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get ‘em, tiger
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
So what’s the wish? He’ll make it come true
Simple as a line out of a doo-wop tune, he’ll make the moves

Often the humble kind but he can’t deny
He was born to blow your mind
Or something along those lines tonight

Tell him what you want and
Baby, he can find you anything you need
Tell him what you’re needing
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get ‘em, tiger
Get down on your knees
Get down on your knees again
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh20Embed
