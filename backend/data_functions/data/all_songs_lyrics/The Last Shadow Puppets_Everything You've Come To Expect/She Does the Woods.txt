She Does the Woods Lyrics
Lazy afternoon strolls make for her howls
At the trees
Going home with trouble written in dirt on
Her knees
There’s nowhere else to be
Off into the long grass I want her to drag me away
Every single footpath that I ever try and take
She’ll circumnavigate

They pass us by and we’re just out of view
They don’t have a clue
They’re in ones they’re in twos
They’re in sensible shoes
They’re in purple cagoules
She’ll jump in the river
You’ll wish you’re the water
And like no one else could
She does the woods

Faces made for daylight
Ought to be out of the house
You’d do the moon and back twice easy
Just to kiss half of her mouth
She’s what it’s all about
They pass us by and we’re just out of view
They don’t have a clue
They’re in ones they’re in twos
They’re in sensible shoes
They’re in purple cagoules
She’ll jump in the river
You’ll wish you’re the water
And like no one else could
She does the woods

She turns my back to the earth and shows me that’s where I’m meant to be
I hear the chirps from the birds as if they heard somebody coming
I see her lit from behind looking down on me
In front of a natural tapestry that’s like a
Spirograph of branches that dance on the breeze

She’ll jump in the river
You’ll wish you’re the water
She’ll jump in the river
You’ll wish you’re the water
And like no one else could-
(She does the woods)2Embed
