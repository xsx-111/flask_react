The Element of Surprise Lyrics
There’s a set of rickety stairs in between my heart and my head
And there ain’t much that ever bothers going up them
Here we go, I'm at it again
And once it’s started, it’s so tricky to stop
Suddenly reminded of things I thought I’d forgot
You’ve got me loosening up my grip on the plot

And it feels like your entrance just caused the temperature to rise
You’d got a look in your eyes as you snuck in the side

And the place I thought I was at hasn’t yet invited me back
The trouble with the chase is it’s so easy to crash
Why colour in the lines if you’re just painting it black?
I thought they were kisses but apparently not
Do you end all your messages with an X marks the spot?
Just let me know when you want your socks knocking off

And it feels like your entrance just caused the temperature to rise
You’d got a look in your eyes as you snuck in the side
Guess there’s nothing like the element of surprise

The element of surprise
The element of surprise
The element of surprise
