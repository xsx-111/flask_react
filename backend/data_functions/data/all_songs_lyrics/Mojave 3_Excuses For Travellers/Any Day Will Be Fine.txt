Any Day Will Be Fine Lyrics
I love the sun
And the hilights in your hair
They turn me on
And if you wanna go
Just go we'll run away
'Cause I don't mind

'Cause any day will be fine
Any day will be fine
Still some distance to run
Let's keep movin' on

You say it's wrong
But it feels so right to me
'Cause all these things
Are just a state of mind
You know it's true

Any day will be fine
Any day will be fine
Still some distance to run
Keep movin' on

Any day will be fine
Any way will be fine
Still some distance to run
Keep movin' onEmbed
