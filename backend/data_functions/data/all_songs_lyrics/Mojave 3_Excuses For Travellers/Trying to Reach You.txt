Trying to Reach You LyricsI got a number on my wall
Someday soon I'm gonna call
Been trying reach you for a
Long long time
Been trying reach you
But I could not find a line
Finding an easy way to break your heart
Finding the hardest part is leaving
I got a number on my wall
Someday soon I'm gonna call
It takes a while before you really
Know what's right
It takes a while before you know
What's rightEmbed
