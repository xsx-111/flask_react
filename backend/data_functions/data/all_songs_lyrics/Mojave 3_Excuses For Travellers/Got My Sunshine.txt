Got My Sunshine Lyrics
Sun came up today and it burned my blues away
The sun came up today and it burned my blues away

Go ahead if you have to leave me
You ain't coming back this time
I hope that's fine

Got my sunshine, I'll get by
Got my sunshine, I'll get by
Got my sunshine, I'll get by

Wind rose up today and it blew my blues away
The wind rose up today and it blew my blues away

Go ahead if you have to leave me
You ain't coming back this time
I hope that's fine

Got my sunshine, I'll get by
Got my sunshine, I'll get by
Got my sunshine, I'll get by
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la

Fly, take your things and fly
Got my sunshine, I'll get by
Got my sunshine (Got my sunshine)
Got my sunshine (Got my sunshine)
Got my sunshine (Got my sunshine)
Got my sunshineEmbed
