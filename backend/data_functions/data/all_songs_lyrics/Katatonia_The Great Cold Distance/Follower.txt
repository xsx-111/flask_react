Follower Lyrics
Hurts to see my incapacity
Shame, idle mind
No, you have changed me
My mouth is shut
Stupidity hath shut my mouth
Shame, idle mind
No, you have changed me

So when you come
I'm too unprepared to come along
I hold your hand so hard, my knuckles turn white
When your clear the streets and kill the lights

See the line
Border to freedom
The words underlined
My name, you have changed it
Your tone changed to cool
This how you tell me once again
How I have nothing on you
How everything is supposed to end

So when you come
I'm too unprepared to come along
I hold your hand so hard, my knuckles turn white
When your clear the streets and kill the lights
Father, I won't make it
It's the journey of a life
Fix my eyes on the sun
What have I done?
Father, I won't make it
It's the journey of a life
Fix my eyes on the sun
What have I done?

So when you come
I'm too unprepared to come along
I hold your hand so hard, my knuckles turn white
When your clear the streets and kill the lights2Embed
