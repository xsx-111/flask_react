Consternation Lyrics
Wave back at me, back is turned
If I fail once, circuit burn

Saw you in the lampglow, you fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until I get there
Hidden I will be
Until I get there
Hidden I will be

Consternation, internal source
Overthrowing, stray from course

Saw you in the lampglow, you fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until I get there
Hidden I will be
Until I get there
Hidden I will be
Saw you in the lampglow, you fade
Nothingness incarnate

Until I get there
Hidden I will be
Until I get there
Hidden I will be1Embed
