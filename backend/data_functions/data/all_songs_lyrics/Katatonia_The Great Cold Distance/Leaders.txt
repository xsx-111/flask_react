Leaders Lyrics
Leaders come, stand in line
Reveal your true self and conform
I sold my song, crossed the borderline
I found something I'd never adjust to

Come here, I've paid up for you
I have sold my weakness too
Come here, I split my heart in two
But you don't have it in you, do you?

Carbon soul, transparent and played out
See you soon in non-fiction
I sold my song, my mouth was sewn
But it's coming undone and that's why I sold out

Come here, I've paid up for you
I have sold my weakness too
Come here, I split my heart in two
But you don't have it in you, do you?Embed
