Displaced LyricsDo you have water in your car
I might get thirsty along the way
Are you sure it isn't very far
Are we getting there today
And is it hard
And complicated
You displace me
Drive me there
Let me sleep
We are coming to an end here see
Drive me there
I'm meant to be deceived
We are coming to an end here see
Reaching for a sentence in my mouth
Well hidden under my tongue
I know what things are all about
I made it so easy for you when you came
For your safety
You displace me
Drive me there
Let me sleep
We are coming to an end here see
Drive me there
I'm meant to be deceived
We are coming to an end here seeEmbed
