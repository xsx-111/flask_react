Code Against the Code LyricsMoney growing on a tree
The cold you have come to find
Money going through the wire
The cold you have come to find
You once were the one who had it
The code against the code
Wait
So much to discover
Wait across the borderline
Soul thinned out
All the filth that soiled your baby
Spit it out when they're coming for you
Lowered's heirEmbed
