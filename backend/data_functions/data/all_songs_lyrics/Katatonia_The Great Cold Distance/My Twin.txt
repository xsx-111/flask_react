My Twin Lyrics
The neck, then the chain
The head is hung in shame
The neck, then the chain
The head is hung in shame
I thought that you had grown
That you would carry on
But now, that I am gone
What else been withdrawn

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been, was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you above us all

I think of love
I let it pass
It feels like fire
But it won't last
You used to be like my twin
And all that's been, was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you above us all
You used to be like my twin
And all that's been, was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you above us all

What is it coming to?
I'm unwilling to go on
You have lost, no one has won

You used to be like my twin
And all that's been, was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you above us all
You used to be like my twin
And all that's been, was it all for nothing?
Are you strong when you're with him?
The one who's placed you above us all3Embed
