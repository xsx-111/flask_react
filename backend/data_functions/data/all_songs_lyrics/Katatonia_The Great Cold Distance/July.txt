July LyricsYou come clean
Waves collide now
Defenseless numb arms
And no voice of reason
So how come you invited me too
You knew I wanted you
You glide above
So this night belongs to you
I know this isn't through
Are you dead to love
I see the bright lights
It's the month of July
It's violent here
Why have you left me
If only you could stay
And keep me in
It's violent here
Why did you run from me
So how come you invited me too
You knew I wanted you
You glide above
So this night belongs to you
I know this isn't through
Are you dead to love
Heat
Night devour me
Repeat
Repetition
I see the bright lights
It's the month of July
It's violent here
Why have you left me
If only you could stay
And keep me in
It's violent here
Why did you run from meEmbed
