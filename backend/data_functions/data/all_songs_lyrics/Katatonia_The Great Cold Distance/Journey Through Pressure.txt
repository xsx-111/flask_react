Journey Through Pressure Lyrics
Pushing the will, being alive
Well I have been, I came far
The process of trying to act unharmed
It will fade out

Thoughts will unwind, no longer mine
They are for you when you come
So long, I'm cutting here
And the water's blood when you come

Pushing the will, being alive
Well I have been, I came far
The process of trying to act unharmed
It will fade out

Thoughts will unwind, no longer mine
They are for you when you come
So long, I'm cutting here
And the water's blood when you come

The sky moves faster at this time of year
The sky moves faster at this time of year
The sky moves faster at this time of year
The sky moves faster at this time of year
Thoughts will unwind, no longer mine
They are for you when you come
So long, I'm cutting here
And the water's blood when you comeEmbed
