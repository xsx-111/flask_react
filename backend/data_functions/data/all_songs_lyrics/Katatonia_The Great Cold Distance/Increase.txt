Increase LyricsVapour, as thin as it gets
I stare right through
The severe sickness in this room
Not mine, it comes from you
Soul cold, indeed
There won't be a time when I'm at ease
Increase coldness
Increase ignorance
Please rewind and look at you, as on film
You will see a mask of shame, I think you will
Perceive your position in life - so unworthy
The severe sickness in this room
Not mine, it comes from you
Find and twist the answer
Save no one from harm
As seen in the vision
Sick sleep, sick dead earth
Soul cold, indeed
There won't be a time when I'm at ease
Increase coldness
