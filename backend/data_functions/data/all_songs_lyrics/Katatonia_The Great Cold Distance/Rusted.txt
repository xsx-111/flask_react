Rusted Lyrics
Rush through the rusted veins
Illuminate the face of one
So I have lied
So unaware about the consequence

I heard no warning
About the little compromise
The distorted views you had

I heard no warning

Cold white spring
A wordless song I sing
Eye, white cloud
All my thoughts are in doubt

Rush through the rusted veins
Illuminate the face of one
So I have a light
So unaware about the consequence
I heard no warning
About the little compromise

Cold white spring
A wordless song I sing
Eye, white cloud
All my thoughts are in doubt3Embed
