Dissolving Bonds LyricsAnd here you are
So much time did you waste from times before
So shut down your sky
Bow down, lights out and die
And now you go
The cold chill cracks, a positive self-detach
Inanimate heart
Hurrying, racing forward
A destined goodbye
Bells rang out the day of your worst fear
Obscure graduation day
Left you but with memories to bear
Lost in hopelessness
Seclusion cut you just as deep as knives
Dissolving the bonds
Time was set to fade away your lives
You said you would always give your love
You said you would always be caring
You said you would never abandon
You said you wouldEmbed
