In the White LyricsAre you in or are you out?
The words are stones in my mouth
Hush, little baby, don't you cry
Truth comes down, strikes me in the eye
Turning seasons within
Brand new nails across my skin
But who am I to imply that I was found?
Then I found you in the white
To overcome this, I become one with
The quiet cold of late November
If you don't see, I'll remain unseen
Until there's time to be remembered
So I had a green light
I was lost in city lights
Not so far from a try
This is not our last goodbye
So I had a green light
I was lost in city lights
Not so far from a try
This is not our last goodbye
Are you in or are you out?
The words are stones in my mouth
Hush, little baby, don't you cry
So I found you, found a way all through
The quiet cold of inner darkness
Now that you're here, it becomes so clear
I have waited for you always1Embed
