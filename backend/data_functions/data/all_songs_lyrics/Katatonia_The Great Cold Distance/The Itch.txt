The Itch LyricsMovement, subdued back then
So quiet now
Subsequence, systematic violence
The great cold distance
The itch - the urge
Make way, think of something
Thin out the fear
Past the tracks, part the ways
One stand here
Medicate, kill the itch
Check the air
And push, and push
Push to get there
Monochrome
Symbol on the surface
Reduced illumination
Chemical inheritance
The lies - the fever
The itch - the urge
The lies - the fever
Make way, think of something
Thin out the fear
Past the tracks, part the ways
One stand here
Medicate, kill the itch
Check the air
And push, and push
Push to get thereEmbed
