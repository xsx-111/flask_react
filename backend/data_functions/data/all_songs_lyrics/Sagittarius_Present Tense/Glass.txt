Glass Lyrics
Along a busy street I find
A bottle tossed away
I hold it to my eyes
And change the color of the day

A broken neck, a jagged edge
Surrounds the changing scene
And passing strangers smile at me
A loving shade of green

Glass (Glass)
Glass (Glass)

A mirror starin' back at me
Turns ev'rything around
And left is right, and right is left
And where can truth be found?

A chandelier weeps crystal tears
From all its crystal eyes
And windows slash their panes of glass
And no one hears their cries
Glass (Glass)
Glass (Glass)Embed
