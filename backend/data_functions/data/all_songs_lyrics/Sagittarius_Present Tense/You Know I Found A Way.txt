You Know I Found A Way LyricsYou know I've found a way
To show my love to you
So now I ask you
To find a way to show your love to me
Dont try to run away
There's no place you can go
Alone, I could go with you
To a place called love
Where the two of us can go
Think of all the dreams we could be sharing
If you trust me to trust you
You know how I love you
You know I've found a way
To show my love to you
So now I ask you
To find a way to show your love to me
To find a way to show your love to meEmbed
