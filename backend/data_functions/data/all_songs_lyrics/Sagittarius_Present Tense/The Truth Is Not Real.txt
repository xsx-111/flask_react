The Truth Is Not Real LyricsSo you have found your mind at last
Was it hiding or winding past
And what makes you think
That you're better off with it
Without it
Get used to living in cloudy days
Rejecting truth because you're out of phase
Up in the air yes you think you know where
The truth is
But the truth is you're not real
Set your spirit free
Face the unknown forces
You see they won't hurt you
The time you know is not your own
So hurry up and repay your loan
Within the ground
Do you still think you found
What truth is
The truth is
You're not real
You're not realEmbed
