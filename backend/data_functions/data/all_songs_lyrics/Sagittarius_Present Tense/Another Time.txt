Another Time LyricsAnother time
You'll see my face
When you're not looking
And run to me
To blindly ask
What's on my mind
Another time
You'll find me in a game
And ask if you can stay and play along
But another time has come
And already gone
Another time
Your heart can sing the music
That I'm hearing
And find a way
To answer all the questions in my eyes
Another time
You'll lift your head and see a sky
That beckons you to try your wings at last
But another time has come
Another time has passed
Another time
The words I'm saying now
Will lose their meaning
Because by then
We'll share the love that now I'm only dreaming
Another time
You'll be the moth who's found the light I know
She's also found her death
But you'll understand another time
So I guess I'll save my breath
Another timeEmbed
