Get The Message LyricsI can't seem to quite get through to you baby
Looks like your reception isn't too clear
We must be tuned in to two different wave lengths
You just don't hear
Get the message
That I'm sending
With a heartbeat
Never ending
Can you hear me
When you're near me
Do you read me
Do you need me
Do you deceive me
Please believe mе
Cause I love you
Get thе message
Get the message
What I'm trying to tell you is very simple
They've been communicating this way for years
If you still don't understand what I'm saying
Look at my tears
Get the message
That i'm sending
With a heartbeat
Never ending
Do you hear me
When you're near me
Do you read me
Will you need me
Do you believe me
Hear I love you
Hear the message
Get the message
Get the message
Get the message
That i'm sending
With a heartbeat
Never ending
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Get the message
Get the message
Get the message
That I'm sending
With a heartbeat
Never ending...Embed
