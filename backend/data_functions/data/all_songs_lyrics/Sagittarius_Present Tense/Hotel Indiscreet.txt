Hotel Indiscreet LyricsWhere does everybody go to let down their hair
No one will care or mind
Living life with someone else that they'd like to be
Change their identity
There's a hotel down on 7th Street
Nonselect and very indiscreet
What goes on behind the doors at 7 o'clock
You'd get a shock
There's no names upon the register
Only cash no checks no signatures
There's no questions as concerning your circumstance
Just pay in advance
Why did Mrs. Seltzer check in late Friday night
Sneak down the flight to where
What are all the happenings in Room 24
Rugs by the door, what for
It's a place you wouldn't recognize
From the outside you can tell the lies
Inside every room there is a story to tell
In the Hotel IndiscreetEmbed
