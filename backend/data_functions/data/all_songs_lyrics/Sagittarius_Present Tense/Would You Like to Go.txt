Would You Like to Go LyricsWould you like to go?
Would you like to go back to the land that you and I once knew?
Where prophets play electric guitars
Plugged into the stars that shine for you and I
Your twinkling eye invites me to bring you
Would you like to go?
Would you like to go back to the land that you and I once knew?
Where choruses of angelic hosts sing alleluia
With portable phonographs made in Japan
Selling for less, and calling me to you
Would you like to go?
We'll fly into the pinky mist
And have our backs scratched by a smile
A while ago I started to begin a song
I hope it won't take long
Would you like to go?
Got the guts to go?
Only we will knowEmbed
