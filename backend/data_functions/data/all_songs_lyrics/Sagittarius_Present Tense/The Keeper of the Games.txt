The Keeper of the Games LyricsThe keeper of the games is calling you
The keeper of the games sees what you do
And the keeper of the games knows what you're doing
When you don't know yourself
The keeper of the games isn't up above
The keeper of the games is here in love
And The keeper of the games knows what we need
To clean up this mess that we're in
And a million and three tomorrows
Will change the ancient games
Will see through all our sorrows
And know from where wе came
The keeper of thе games is asking you
To live the way you always knew
And the keeper of the games says "don't be afraid"
Cause time is on your sideEmbed
