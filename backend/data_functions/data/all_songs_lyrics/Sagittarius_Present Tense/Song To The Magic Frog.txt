Song To The Magic Frog LyricsAbove the cloud-like shimmering opal
Through some misty blue
Still before me
Stands the first morning when I first saw you
Will you ever
Will you ever know?
Fleeting with each passing moment
Dewdrops in the sun
Changing all in
To forever I'll die, I won
Will you ever
Will you ever know?
Will you ever
Will you ever know?
Let's not ever leave here
Know you might seem fixed to go
I'll pretend
You're still besidе me
Wonder if you'll evеr know
Will you ever
Will you ever know?
Above the cloud-like shimmering opal
Through some misty blue
Still before me
Stands the morning when I first saw you
Will you ever
Will you ever know?
Will you ever
Will you ever know?
Will you ever
Will you ever know?Embed
