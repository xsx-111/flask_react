Musty Dusty LyricsMusty dusty
Tattered and torn
All of the toys I played with
Out of tune my little tin horn
All of my memories shattered and gone
Teddy bear and Bobo the clown
Little soldiers waiting at arms
For the day which cannot be found
Gone back to the sun
Music box unspun
Lost all its songs
Musty dusty
Tattered and torn
All of the toys I played with
Out of tune my little tin horn
All of my memories shattered and gone
Save your tears
My lost little friends
Gone the years when all of us knew
Days of no beginnings nor ends
All thе maple trees
Butterflies and bees
Vanishеd away
Musty dusty
Tattered and torn
All of the toys I played with
Out of tune my little tin horn
All of my memories shattered and goneEmbed
