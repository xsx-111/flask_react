Oblivion Lyrics
I never walk about after dark
It's my point of view
'Cause someone could break your neck
Coming up behind you
Always coming and you'd never have a clue
And now I look behind all the time
I will wait forever
Always looking straight
Thinking, counting all the hours you wait

See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night

And no, I'm not a jerk
I would ask if you could help me out
It's hard to understand
'Cause when you're running by yourself
It's hard to find someone to hold your hand
I know it's good to be tough like me
But I would wait forever
I need someone else
To look into my eyes and tell me
"Girl, you know you've got to watch your health"
To look into my eyes and tell me
La-la-la-la-la
To look into my eyes and tell me
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la

See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night
See you on a dark night71Embed
