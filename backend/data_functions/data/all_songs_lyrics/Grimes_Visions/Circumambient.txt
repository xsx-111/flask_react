Circumambient Lyrics
Oh baby, I can't say
That everything is okay
'Cause I have a problem
And I don't know how to start from
But, baby I can't do
Anything to help you
'Cause I’m working to the bone
And you know, we're gonna have to play alone

Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'mma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma

Oh, baby, I can't say
That everything is okay
'Cause I have a problem
And I don't know how to start from
Oh, baby, I can't do
Oh anything to help you
‘Cause I’m working to the bone
And you know, and you know
You're gonna have to play alone
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'mma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'ma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
Hey, I'ma, hey, I'mma, ready to say, I'ma
Working to the bone all day, I'ma
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma
I'ma, I'ma, I'ma, I'ma12Embed
