Genesis Lyrics
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know

Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart

Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
(I'm the one in love)
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
(I'm the one in love)
I'm the one in love
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
Oh, heart, and then it falls, and then I fall, and then I know

Ever see, ever be, ever know my heart
Ever see, ever be, ever know

Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love
Home, and I know
Playing the deck above
It's always different
I'm the one in love51Embed
