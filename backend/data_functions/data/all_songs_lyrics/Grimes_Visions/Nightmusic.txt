Nightmusic Lyrics
She'd be, she'd be on the sun
Love could always may come and go
Do you wanna say oh
Guys do not wanna say
Anything in front of me
Love do you wanna say oh
Guys do not wanna say
Everything I wanna say
I don't wanna say, I don't wanna say
She'd be, she'd be on the sun
Love could always may come and go
To the night, oh

I’ve been hard to run up in the snow
You’ve been lied to anywhere to go

They sing in the dark
They're talking to me
And sing in the night
Enlighten the phase
They sing in the dark
They're talking to me
And sing in the night
Enlighten the phase
They sing in the dark
They're talking to me
And sing in the night
Enlighten the phase
Tonight’s the night
I waited 'til the end
Tonight’s the night
And I will say it’s fair
So it’s underwater
And you got her
You would never let her go
Oh, woah-oh
Tonight’s the night
I waited 'til the end
Tonight’s the night
And I will say it’s fair
So it’s underwater
And you got her
You would never let her go
Oh, woah-oh
Oh, woah-oh

She'd be, she'd be on the sun
Love could always may come and go
Do you wanna say, oh
Guys do not wanna say
Anything in front of me
Love do you wanna say, oh
Guys do not wanna say
Everything I wanna say
I don't wanna say, I don't wanna say
She'd be, she'd be on the sun
Love could always may come and go
To the night, oh
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night
I sleep in the day and dance in the night3Embed
