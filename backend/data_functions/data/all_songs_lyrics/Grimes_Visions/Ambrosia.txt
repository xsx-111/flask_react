Ambrosia Lyrics
Hi, hi, bitter heart and you look at me
And no one can ask you what you think
Hi, hi, bitter heart, you look asleep
And no one can ask you what you think

Feeling no emotion
Step into the ocean
Now my mind is everywhere
And drowning is the only thought I have
Walk into the water
Boiling as it's hotter
I was looking everywhere
And drowning is the only thought I have

'Cause every time you look away
I think I love you more each day
'Cause every time you look away
I think I love you more each day

Hi, hi, bitter heart and you look at me
And no one can ask you what you think
Hi, hi, bitter heart, you look asleep
And no one can ask you what you think
'Cause every time you look away
I think I love you more each day
('Cause every time you look away
I think I love you more each day)

Feeling no emotion
Step into the ocean
Now my mind is everywhere
And drowning is the only thought I have
Walk into the water
Boiling as it's hotter
I was looking everywhere
And drowning is the only thought I have1Embed
