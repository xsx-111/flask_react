Colour of Moonlight (Antiochus) Lyrics
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
When you’re taking your time
When you’re taking your time
When you’re taking your time
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
When you’re taking your time
When you’re taking your time
When you’re taking your time
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
When you’re taking your time
When you’re taking your time
When you’re taking your time
Close your eyes and tell me what you see
The oil and the rain mix with the setting sun
After dark when I can't believe the sun
Could feel the whole world glory in a spotlight

All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark, like a new day
All is on the room, all is on the room
All is on the room, and I can’t say
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark
And it fills up the dark, like a new day

Close your eyes and tell me what you see
Hold on to me
There's something glowing and my blood is bubbling
And it fills up the dark, like a new day3Embed
