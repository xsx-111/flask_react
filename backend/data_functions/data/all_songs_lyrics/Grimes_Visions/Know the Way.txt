Know the Way Lyrics
She's giving up the cross
She'll end her faith in love
And I know the way
I know the way
I know the way
I can believe in me
She's giving up the cross
She'll end her faith in love
And I know the way (I don't know the way)
I know the way (I don't know the way)
I know the way (I don't know the way)
I can't believe you're home
