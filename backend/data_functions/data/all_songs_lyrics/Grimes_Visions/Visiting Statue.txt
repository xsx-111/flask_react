Visiting Statue Lyrics
So, so, so, so, bring it all back
I would start to see that I was scared to see it
(Bring it all home, bring it all home, bring it all home
Oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost)
So, so, so, so, bring it all back
I would start to see that I was scared to see it
(Bring it all home, bring it all home, bring it all home
(Oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost)
So, so, so, so, bring it all back
I would start to see that I was scared to see it
(Bring it all home, bring it all home, bring it all home
Oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost)
So, so, so, so, bring it all back
I would start to see that I was scared to see it
(Bring it all home, bring it all home, bring it all home
Oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost2Embed
