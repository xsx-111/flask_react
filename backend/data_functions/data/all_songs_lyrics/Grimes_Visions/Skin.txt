Skin Lyrics
Soft skin you touch me within
So I know I can be human once again
I know you're faced with something
That could consume you completely
Soft skin you touch me once again
And somehow it stings cause I know it is the end
I hate that you're leaving
So why don't you talk to me?
You act like nothing ever happened
But it meant the world to me

And you can't, and you can't
See the weight in the trees
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight of the leaves
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight in the trees
(These are our)
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight of the leaves
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
(These are our falling secrets)
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
Soft skin
Iâ€™ll have you be near my heart
Until I feel human
Soft skin, oh
You were never in love to begin with
So now I'm suffering

Oh you can't, and you can't
See the weight in the trees
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight of the leaves
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight in the trees
(These are our)
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight of the leaves
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
(These are our falling secrets)
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight in the trees
(These are our)
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight of the leaves
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
(These are our falling secrets)
And you can't, and you can't
See the weight on my heart
(These are our)
(These are our)
Soft skin you touch me within
So I know I can be human once again
I know you're faced with something
That could consume you completely
Soft skin you touch me once again
And somehow it stings cause I know it is the end
I hate that you're leaving
So why don't you talk to me?
You act like nothing ever happened
But it meant the world to me10Embed
