Symphonia IX (My Wait is U) Lyrics
I try and try to make you cry
And make you love me
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say yes
The need to be the best before the need to rest
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say yes

See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
Be in the dark to be in a dark side
Be in a deep mind
See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
Be in the dark to be in a dark side
Be in a deep mind

To make the pain defuse the flame can be trying
But I would say yes, I would say yes
So as you fade away alive, I lay dying
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say!
See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
Be in the dark to be in a dark side
Be in a deep mind
See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
Be in the dark to be in a dark side
Be in a deep mind11Embed
