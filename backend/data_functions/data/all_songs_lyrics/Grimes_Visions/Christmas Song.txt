Christmas Song Lyrics
I be about it, I've been about it
I love my hood, I spring the shot
And I throw it up, I rep the crown
And you saw my cap, it's in my blazes on
Everywhere, I beat my cases
Across the board, golden laces
I'm mortified, into the races
My bitch is fluent, she speak my language
Hop the flight while my killers hanging
We pistol grip 'em, we really banging
I ain't with this shit, I don't really claim it
Record settin', this is really anxious
So I clip this shit if you perpetratin'
T-Y clique they ain't never playin'
We pistol poppin', you pistol playin'
I'm done with talking, killer what you saying

Polo down
I'm polo down
I'm polo down
I'm polo down my socks
Polo down
I'm polo down
I'm polo down my socks
Polo on my top
Polo on my socks
I fuck around for rent, a mansion or a shop
I hold 'em down for my block
Whole acid dropped in that pot
I cook it 'til it's a rock
You slip and you could get popped
Lil L turn yourself in
Be one of my killers still lock
The dumb times too high
My hope bounced now I'm shot
The game had been called up
I wanna leave it behind
I'm polo down to my socks
Four X's all in my Sprite

My Sprite, my Sprite, my Sprite, my Sprite
My Sprite, my Sprite, my Sprite
(Polo down
I'm polo down
I'm polo down
I'm polo down my socks
I'm polo down my socks
I'm polo down my socks)Embed
