Life After Death Lyrics
Baby, you know when the lights go down
Won't you say please, mama, need me
Leaving the grass and the trees behind
The trees are gone and I wanted to die

I wanna blind my mind in a black hole
I wanna bury my eyes with the sunshine
I wanna know what the stars are talking about tonight
I wanna know where the angels are sleeping
I wanna know if there's something worth keeping
I can't tell you

Baby, you know when the lights go down
Leaving the grass and the trees behind
Baby, you know when the lights go down
Won't you say please, mama, need me
Leaving the grass and the trees behind
The trees are gone and I wanted to die
Baby, you know when the lights go down
Won't you say please, mama, need me
Leaving the grass and the trees behind
The trees are gone and I wanted to die
Baby, you know when the lights go down
Won't you say please, mama, need me
Leaving the grass and the trees behind
The trees are gone and I wanted to die
That one was okay1Embed
