Back Up Against the Wall Lyrics
You yell out in defiance
You're backed up against the wall
They're up there clutching their guns and
It makes you feel real small

So you can cuss, spit, throw bottles
Broken glass
But it all ends up with handcuffs on your hands

You run around and spray paint
Graffiti on everybody's wall
You think that's bitchin man
That ain't nothing at all!

So you can cuss, spit, throw bottles
Broken glass
But it ends up with a swift kick to your ass

You yell out in defiance
You're backed up against the wall
They're up there clutching their guns and
It makes you feel real small
Cuss, spit, throw bottles
Broken glass
But it ends up with handcuffs on your handsEmbed
