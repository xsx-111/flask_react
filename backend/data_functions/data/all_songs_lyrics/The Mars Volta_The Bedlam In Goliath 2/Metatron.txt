Metatron Lyrics
Maybe I'll break down
Maybe I'll try
Circumvent inoculation
And I just want a cut
When will I break down?
Lately I might
Un-connect the fascination
And I just want to touch

This is a list, they're my demands
Forget the question, come on, bring your nervous hands
You read it in my letter, "Patience worth is dead"
Suffocate the inkwell, "I am legion," said the pen
Her seraph snout and cruciform limp
I blame the shrouding of a lesser man
My sigil contraptions, they walk with no crutches
Don't show me the hinges, I am absent

Maybe I'll break down
Maybe I'll try
Circumvent inoculation
And I just want a cut
When will I break down?
Lately I might
Un-connect the fascination
And I just want to touch
She came to me when she was pouring out of drool
Under sedation, under vulgar multitudes
If you stay and try to fix what you did
The sheets were wet from all those messages
A million petitions, her lock with no key
You forfeit the right to be believed
Full implant, shapeless as a jewel
And I am stranded by eternal solitude

Maybe I'll break down
Maybe I'll try
Circumvent inoculation
And I just want a cut
When will I break down?
Lately I might
Un-connect the fascination
And I just want to touch

The vault that I call home
It falls beneath your palms
Before I crawl my way out, she calls
You're standing right outside my window
Water thirsting
You're standing right outside my window
Water thirsting
When will I drown?
I'll never get a distance shot, heard vesper pure
I never want to see your face until the word is made flesh
You'd better ask Metatron
Those flowers that withered away in the pages of your book
For one day they won't block your route

In the dead plot you dream in
Ten go away, ten born of pray, ten go away
Folding wormholes
My time is riding in the alphabet
Folding wormholes
My time is writing on the wall


In the dead plot you dream in
Ten go away, ten born of pray, ten go away
Folding wormholes
My time is riding in the alphabet
Folding wormholes
My time is writing on the wall
Debase by your sentence, I fell in the trap
What door slid behind me? I can't see it anymore
When she sleeps as a witness, got no better hands
Tied a single stutter, do you speak my dialect?
Accidents will happen, keep your earnings to yourself
One sip under the table until it moves all by itself
In the eye of Fatima, I've kept all your dreams
In a waking solution of indictment

Maybe I'll break down
Maybe I'll try
Circumvent inoculation
And I just want a cut
When will I break down?
Lately I might
Un-connect the fascination
And I just want to touch2Embed
