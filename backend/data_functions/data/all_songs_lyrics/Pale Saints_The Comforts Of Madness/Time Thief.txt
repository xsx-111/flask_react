Time Thief LyricsThought we could breathe easily
It's more often on the weak
Instead now it descends
To sell our dreams
And mail us into bland
Chase it cos it's dangerous on foot
You know i'd help you if i wanted to
Don't laugh because I've
Tried to fill the hole inside again
Lives inside this house
Lives in one of us
Time thief's coming
Fully realise
Frightened of the world, pretend
That it's your favourite daddy shirt and
Wear it, we're in outer space
The money's falling through the wall again
Lives inside this house
Lives in both of us
Time thief's coming
Fully realise
Round and round and round we go
The words are freezing and there's always
One more clue to comprehend
It'll take you and jump into your head
Lives inside this house
Lives in both of us
Time thief's coming
Fully realiseEmbed
