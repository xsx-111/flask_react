Way the World Is LyricsThis is the way
The way it has to be
This is the way
The way we all will go
Slaving away for a minute of peace
Watching our money as it rolls on in
Time will get you in the end
And take away the things
The things you thought you had
Time will take away your friends
And leave you all alone
Alone until the end
This is the way
The way it has to be
And this is the way
The way we all will goEmbed
