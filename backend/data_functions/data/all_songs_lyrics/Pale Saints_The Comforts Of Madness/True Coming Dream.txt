True Coming Dream LyricsDear, are you still here?
The river rushes on
Don't you think it's wrong?
They're only in your head
The things you create
Just the empty shells
Of our yesterdays
Say you'll never breathe a word
It's time to trick yourself
Until you break in two
But you could be
Far away from here
And all you what to do
Until your dreams come true
Drugged sensibility
Sketches I have made
On an empty road
But you could be
Far away from here
And all you want to do
Until your dreams come trueEmbed
