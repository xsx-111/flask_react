Sea of Sound LyricsYour body's cold, you're on the bed
I'm the only one who knows you're there
I'm reeling in that silver line
The cord that brings you back in time
Reality obscures my view
The pain of wanting to
When am i going to be a part of you?
Your eyes are closed, they're in your hair
But i'll make it, just say you care
When everyone has had their fill
You're holding on although you're ill
I watch the ripples in the storm
Until i have the groove
My mind might flow and leave me
Over you
How can you want to stay like this?
The choice is ignorance or bliss
We'll go together don't be scared
It won't take long we'll soon be there
When we arrive just look around
There's so much to be found
We'll sail away upon a sea of sound1Embed
