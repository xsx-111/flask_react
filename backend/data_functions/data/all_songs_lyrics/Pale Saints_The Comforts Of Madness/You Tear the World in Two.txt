You Tear the World in Two LyricsTear the world in two
And choose a half
But look inside you
You know what you are
I've seen it through
And you will too
I can tell that you
Feel these things too
Know yourself
And teach yourself to walk
Into the hole
Exploding in your thoughts
I've seen it through
And you will too
I can tell that you
Feel these things too
I've seen it through
And you will too
I can tell that you
Feel these things too
I've seen it through
And you will too
You tear the world in two
I'll destroy youEmbed
