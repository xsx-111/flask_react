Fell From the Sun LyricsYou fell from my sun
Now you're feeling so cold
Never thought morning
Could feel so alone
They say you've got to live by doing
She says she felt all undone
They say every day is dying
Like the sun
Still in a cloud
And your rain's falling down
Clouds in the sky
And the hills turn around
They say every day of living
Should feel as though it were the last
They say hold on to that feeling
Not the past
You fell from my sun
Now you're feeling so cold
Never thought morning
Could feel so alone
They say you've got to live by doing
She said she felt all undone
They say you've got to keep on trying
For the sun
For the sunEmbed
