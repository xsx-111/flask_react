Black Moon LyricsOh the devil is rising with the moon he cries and my blood runs cold
Oh no never was the darkness so black, no light and nowhere to go
My spirit is crying for a love so tired of being alone
I remember he came here to steal, and you are his stealer of souls
I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name
I've been blinded, lost and confused, darkness will call me no more
Heaven is no friend of mine, no god ever knocked on my door
I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
It's calling out my name, it's calling
I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
Oh it's calling my name
I'm standing on the dark side of time reaching for the power of her hand
She's weaving an unholy light and calls from Lucifer's land
I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
An angel of hell is rising, heaven's no friend of mine
I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
I see a black moon rising, and it causes so much pain
An angel of hell is rising, heaven's no friend of mine
I see a black moon rising, and it's calling out my name
It's calling my name, this spirit's crying for love
Heaven's no friend of mineEmbed
