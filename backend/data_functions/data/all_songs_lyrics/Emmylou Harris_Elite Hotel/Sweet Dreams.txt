Sweet Dreams Lyrics
Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you and start my life anew
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

You don't love me it's plain
I should have known you'll never wear my ring
I know I should hate you the whole night through
Instead of having sweet dreams about you


Sweet dreams of you
Every night I go through
Why can't I forget you, start loving someone new
Instead of having sweet dreams about you

Instead of having sweet dreams about youEmbed
