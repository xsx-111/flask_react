Together Again Lyrics
Together again my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The key to my heart you hold in your hand
And nothing else matters 'cause we're together again

Together again the gray skies are gone
You're back in my arms now where you belong
The love that we knew is living again
And nothing else matters 'cause we're together again


Together again my tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights are now at an end
The love that we knew is living again
And nothing else matters 'cause we're together again
And nothing else matters 'cause we're together againEmbed
