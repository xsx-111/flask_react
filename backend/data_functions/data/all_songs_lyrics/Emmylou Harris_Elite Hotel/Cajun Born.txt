Cajun Born Lyrics
I was born on the bayou
Thirty miles out of Lafayette
My daddy was a Cajun man
Lord, he taught us how to plow
I remember mama's breakfast
Cush cush and a cane
Being served on a beignet
Lord, I wish I had some now

I'm a Cajun-born, I'm a Cajun-bred
And when I die, I'm a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou

We went to church every Sunday
We had a French-speaking preacher man
We joked about the preacher man
'Cause we thought he wore a dress, yes
After church we had a party
We played our music on the phonograph
We had a man singing "Jole Blon"
Oh, made a sinner out of me
I'm a Cajun-born, I'm a Cajun-bred
And when I die, I'm a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou

When I'm ready to be married
I'm gonna be his Cajun lady
Something sort of like my mama
'Cause I ain't no other kind, oh, no other kind
'Ever fortune takes me
If it makes me or it breaks me
These memories won't forsake me
Louisiana on my mind

I'm a Cajun-born, I'm a Cajun-bred
And when I die, I'm a Cajun dead
If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayou

If I die in Alaska, if I die in Ohio
This soul will find its way back to the bayouEmbed
