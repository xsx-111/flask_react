Amarillo Lyrics
My baby never was the cheating kind
But it wasn't 'cause the ladies didn't try
Now everywhere we go they're walking around him slow
Giving him a flutter and a sigh
Now I got him past that redhead in Atlanta
Lord, I walked all over that black-eyed Cajun Queen
But outside of Amarillo, he found his thrill, I'll tell you
Oh, I lost him to a jukebox and a pinball machine

Oh, Amarillo what you want my baby for?
Oh, Amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me, hooked him in the first degree
He'll put another quarter, push Dolly and then Porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine

If we only hadn't stopped in there for coffee
If someone hadn't played "The Window Up Above"
Oh, he'd still be mine today but he heard those fiddles play
One look and then I knew this must be love
Oh, that pinball machine's in the corner
Well, he saw the lights and he had to hear them ring
And he never was the same after he won his first free game
Oh, I lost him to a jukebox and pinball machine
Oh, Amarillo what you want my baby for?
Oh, Amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me, now you hooked him in the first degree
He'll put another quarter, push Dolly and then Porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machine
Oh, Amarillo what you want my baby for?
Oh, Amarillo now he won't come home no more
You done played a trick on me, hooked him in the first degree
He'll put another quarter, push Dolly and then Porter
While he racks up fifty thousand on the pinball machineEmbed
