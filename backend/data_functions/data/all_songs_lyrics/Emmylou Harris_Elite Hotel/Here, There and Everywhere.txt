Here, There and Everywhere Lyrics
Here making each day of the year
Changing my life with one wave of his hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there

Running my hands through his hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but he doesn't know she's there

I want him everywhere and if he's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him everywhere

Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there
To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere


I want him everywhere and if he's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love him is to meet him everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching his eyes and hoping I'm always there
To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhereEmbed
