Till I Gain Control Again Lyrics
Just like the sun over the mountain tops
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my morning times
Like sunlight dancing on your skin

I've never gone so wrong as for telling lies to you
What you've seen is what I've been
There is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can

Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control again


Like a lighthouse you must stand alone
Landmark the sailor's journeys end
No matter what seas I have been sailing on
I'll always roll this way again
Out on the road that lies before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
Till I can gain control againEmbed
