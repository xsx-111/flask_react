Jambalaya Lyrics
Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou

Well jambalaya, crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Because tonight I'm gonna see my cher amie-o
Gonna pick guitar, fill fruit jar, and be gay-o
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou


Thibodaux Fontaineaux, the place is buzzing
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Well we dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

Well jambalaya, crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Because tonight I'm gonna see my cher amie-o
Pick guitar, fill fruit jar, and be gay-o
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou

Well jambalaya, crawfish pie and fillet gumbo
Because tonight I'm gonna see my cher amie-o
Well we'll dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayou
Son of a gun, gonna have big fun on the bayouEmbed
