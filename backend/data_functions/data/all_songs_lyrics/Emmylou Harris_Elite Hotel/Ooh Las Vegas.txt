Ooh Las Vegas Lyrics
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're going to make a wreck outta me

The first time I lose I drink whiskey
And the second time I lose I drink gin
Third time I lose I drink anything
Because I think I'm going to win

Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're going to make a wreck outta me

Now the queen of spades is a friend of mine
The queen of hearts is a bitch
Someday when I clean up my mind
I'll find out which is a which
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're going to make a wreck outta me


Spend all night with the dealer
Just trying to get ahead
Spend all day at the Holiday Inn
Just trying to get out of bed

Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas
Ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're going to make a wreck outta me

Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're going to make a wreck outta me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're going to make a wreck outta meEmbed
