One Of These Days Lyrics
I won't have to chop no wood
I can be bad or I can be good
I can be any way that I feel
One of these days
Might be a woman that's dressed in black
Be a hobo by the railroad track
I'll be gone like the wayward wind
One of these days

One of these days it will soon
Be all over cut and dry
And I won't have this urge
To go all bottled up inside
One of these days I'll look back
And I'll say I left in time
Because somewhere for me
I know there's peace of mind

I might someday walk across this land
Carrying the Lord's book in my hand
Going across the country singing loud as I can
One of these days
But I won't have trouble on my back
Cutting like the Devil with a chopping axe
Got to shake it off my back
One of these days
One of these days it will soon
Be all over cut and dry
And I won't have this urge
To go all bottled up inside
One of these days I'll look back
And I'll say I left in time
Because somewhere for me
I know there's peace of mind

There's going to be peace of mind for me
One of these daysEmbed
