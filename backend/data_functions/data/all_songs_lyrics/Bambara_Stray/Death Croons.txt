Death Croons Lyrics
Death orders a drink, "Something pink with cherries
And a sugar rim," he says
"And make sure it's sweet"
He grabs his wallet from his shirt pocket
And two gold teeth clink in his empty glass
He rattles them and laughs
An older woman in a stained sundress
Sits down right next to Death and says
"You got some fucked up eyes, but they seem wild"
Death takes off his glasses and smiles
As she flashes a big bag full of blow
Saying, "Tonight's so slow
Wish this place would explode"

He says "I
Yeah, I am not your kind"
(Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
You'll see (Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
And you'll see
When you see me in the light
(Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
You'll see me in the light (Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
Hey
He puts his glasses back on, sees a lightning bug blinking
Flipping around in her hair
He flicks it on the bar and stares
She says, "I never see these things
Not around here, not this time of year"
Then she drowns it with her beer
Death's face lights up as she plucks
Each of its struggling wings and says
"I hear they're all dying, city light's too confusing"
Death's crooning

I
Yeah, I am not your kind
(Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
You'll see (Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
And you'll see
When you see me in the light
(Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
You'll see in the light (Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
Hey

He looks at her dress and thinks about wearing it
Tearing its seams and stretching it on his fat body
'Til the stain settles over his heart
But there's other relics in the trunk of his car
Countless years of collecting, keeping his favorites close
This filthy flower-print dress would fit in nice, though
He drains his cosmo and says
"It's been a pleasure, but you gotta know"
I am not your kind
(Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
You'll see (Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
And you'll see
When I feel that it's your time
(Come on, baby, let's have some fun)
When I feel it's your time (Come on, baby, let's have some fun)

And what she said echoes
(I'll be in the bathroom waiting) As he drives away, woo
(I'll be in the bathroom waiting) Fly squirming in a web, yeah
(I'll be in the bathroom waiting) As he drives away
(I'll be in the bathroom waiting) Puts a blonde wig on his head
(I'll be in the bathroom waiting) As he drives away
(I'll be in the bathroom) Laughing like a pig squeals
As he turns aroundEmbed
