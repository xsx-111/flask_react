Stay Cruel Lyrics
I hadn't dreamed in years
My nights had become lonely jump cuts to morning
And then I saw Miracle dance

Pulled from my dream by a siren
The kind of fantasy I'd spend my life in
Where she made me skin my knees at her shrine then
She kicked me in the teeth for my crying
Hooked me on a leash and then she tied it
Tightly to a tree where her little dogs piss

On a night like this
When a dream of her is ripped away
Close my eyes and say

"Try to stay cruel for me"
(Cruel for you, baby, cruel for you, honey)
Just for another minute
Try to stay cruel for me
(Cruel for you, baby, cruel for you, honey)
And though I don't deserve it
Try to stay cruel for me, yeah
(Cruel for you, baby, cruel for you, honey)
One night, I watched her pulling bits of wig from her braces
After she'd cleared all the bills from the stage
I nearly approached her then
'Til I saw her face almost grateful in the mirrored wall
And I wished it would fall and shatter
Tonight I'll try again

Hey, grab the cash I've been saving
Hobble to the club, start waiting
Drink a few to keep my courage from waning
She pounces on the pole and starts her flailing
I'm soaked in sweat, my chest is aching
The metal on her teeth flashes like a beacon, yeah

I wave my cash at the stage
She smiles, touching my hand
I recoil and say, "Huh"

Try to stay cruel for me
(Cruel for you, baby, cruel for you, honey)
Yeah, no smiles, no mercy
Try to stay cruel for me, yeah
(Cruel for you, baby, cruel for you, honey)
Can't take no more pity, yeah
Yeah, you gotta stay cruel
(Cruel for you, baby, cruel for you, honey)
Yeah, just like when I'm dreaming, huh
Try to say something cruel
(Cruel for you, baby, cruel for you, honey)
Or I'll be lost, please
(You put that cash in my hand, I'll be cruel for you)
I'm ready (Cruel for you, honey)
I'm your limping slave, yeah
(Come on, you weak little man, I'll be cruel for you)
No kindness, no tenderness, no (Cruel for you, honey)
Just cruel
(You put that cash in my hand, I'll be cruel for you)
Try to stay cruel, I wanna taste that (Cruel for you, honey)
Meanness you sing about, huh
(Come on you weak little man, I'll be cruel for you)
Yeah, try to stay cruel for me (Cruel for you, honey)
I want your leather, your steel, your heavy heelEmbed
