Sweat Lyrics
Well, I saw John in a vision years after he died
I asked what it's like to stop living
He said, "It's a look in your eye"
Then he moved in slow motion
Said, "It's kind of like that too
Death is what you make it
But you'll find that out soon"

No halo, no wings, just seventeen
With a sheen of nothing (Huh)

Connor's mom wore a bandana on her head
Frail and tired, but still smiling
Though she rarely left her bed
One day she called us in, put Old Yeller on TV
And we watched it, both wishing
We were outside climbing trees

When the kid shot his dog
She fixed Connor's hair and said (Huh, huh)
"Though it doesn't seem fair
Sometimes love's interrupted by death"
Near the end, KC said, "Son, no savior will return
And his daddy ain't waiting for us
See what happened to Irene after years at the church?
Ain't no good book keep maggots away from their lunch"
And the last words he said to his nurse were
"Pray for me" (Huh)

Ed reclined on a frozen body for a smoke
His friend stepped onto a landmine, Ed's uniform got soaked
His eyes lingered on the cigarette in his hand
And he ashed it with his new finger the doc cut from a dead man

He told me nights were so black
It's like you passed through the other side (Hey)
And you're not sure if you're alive
'Til you feel the sweat burn your eyes

At her place after working a late shift at the bar
Drunk and mad at the hot city night
She was scared, saying people got shot up on Starr
I said, "Everything is alright"
And it all seemed so suddenly sweet to me
Even cleaning up rich tourist piss on my knees
Kicking her hissing cat off of my feet, I told her
"We're still sweating" (Huh)Embed
