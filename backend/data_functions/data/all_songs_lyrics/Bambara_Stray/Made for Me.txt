Made for Me Lyrics
I watch you cry again
In the only bar tonight that's slow
Wearing the dress I met you in
All those years ago
Now you say, "If there is a Hell
That's where you'll be
Consumed by pain you never felt but
You caused in me"

Lit cigarettes will rain
As you feed my bones to hungry strays
You'll kiss each one and give them names
Using my ribs for games

Try to read some stranger's thoughts
Through his piss-drunk, pale-eyed stare
Then I order another shot
And I start to pet your hair, "There, there"
You plucked me out of the wind
Like some insect whirling by, yeah
Though I never stopped stinging
You kept me alive
Lit cigarettes will rain
On a field where horses roam untamed
See you running with them through the flames
Wildflowers in their manes
As you lead the stampede my way

Or maybe it's shivers and snow
An ocean of ice on frostbitten toes
Where whales sing their sad songs beneath my feet
And a girl with long dark hair
Glides between them with ease
Hey

When Death comes driving through
Saying, "Son, take a seat"
I'll say, "Only if you're heading to
The Hell she made for me"

Your cigarettes will rain
Burning holes into my face
Hold out my tongue like an ashtray
Try to taste your lips through the painEmbed
