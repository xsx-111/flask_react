Sing Me to the Street Lyrics
Yeah

I keep thinking, shifting in my sleep
Sirens in the distance sing me to the street
And I go see what's in the air
Probably nothing (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Train is leaving, I catch it just in time
The vomit riding with me crawls in a sickle-shaped design
Towards my feet, take it as a sign

And it's saying (You will go)
I know (You will go)
I'll go away (Away)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
But it's nothing
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

The show's empty except that guy I always see, yeah
He creeps up and asks me if I've heard what's happening
And I say, "I don't care at all
Hopefully nothing" (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
He says, "You know Cole was murdered just about one year back
Well, Claire had their baby, tonight she drowned it in the bath
Saying, 'Death will find us all'"
I say, "Fuck, man" (You will go)
Just go (You will go)
Just go away (Away)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Oh, yeah (You will go)
Leave me alone (You will go)
Just go away (Away)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I want to hear nothing
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

(Standing in the deli light)
I duck into the deli
(No one's at the counter)
Just a sleeping cat
(Grab their little sleeping cat)
I grab the cat and run (And run)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

And I tell it (You will go)
You know (You will go)
You will go away (Away)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Yeah (You will go)
Can't you see? (You will go)
You are the same as me (Away)
And we're nothing
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'll call you Nothing
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
I'll call you Nothing1Embed
