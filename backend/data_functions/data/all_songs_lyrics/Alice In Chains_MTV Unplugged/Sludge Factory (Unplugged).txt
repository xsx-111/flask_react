Sludge Factory (Unplugged) Lyrics
You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time
There's no pressures besides brilliance, let's say by day 9... fuck!
Jerry: We're allowed a couple of those, it's been a while
You guys just get to hear more, that's all
Layne: That's just how these things go

You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time
Things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake, and I'm high!
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time
20 hours won't print my picture milk carton size
Carton size, carton size, carton size

Call me up congratulations ain't the real why
There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day 9
Corporate ignorance lets me control time
By the way, by the way

Once again you see him in this
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me
Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die
You have always told me you'd not live past 25
I say stay long enough to repay all who cause strife

Once again you see him in this
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me
Once again you see him in this
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle
Out a date for me3Embed
