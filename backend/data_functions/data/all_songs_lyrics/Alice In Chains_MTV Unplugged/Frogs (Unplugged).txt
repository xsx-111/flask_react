Frogs (Unplugged) Lyrics
What does friend mean to you?
A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused?
All included but you
Alone

The sounds of silence often soothe
Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen and change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue

Why's it have to be this way?
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way

Flowers watched through wide eyes bloom
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon
Why's it have to be this way?
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way
Be this way

At 7 AM
On a Tuesday in August
Next week, I turn 28
I'm still young, it'll be me
Off the wall, I scraped you
I gotta wake
Show me, young, I'm raped
I've shown my fate
It's today, afraid
Never gonna fuck with me again
Don't fuck with me again
Have one go
Hell's afraid
You
