Would? (Unplugged) Lyrics
Know me broken by my master
Teach thee a child, love hereafter

Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

Drifting body, its sole desertion
Flying, not yet quite the notion

Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way


Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way, yeah
Am I wrong? Have I run too far to get home?
Have I gone? Left you here alone
Am I wrong? Have I run too far to get home? Yeah
Have I gone? Left you here alone
If I would, could you?Embed
