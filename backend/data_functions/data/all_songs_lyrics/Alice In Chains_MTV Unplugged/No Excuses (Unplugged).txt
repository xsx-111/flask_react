No Excuses (Unplugged) Lyrics
It's alright, there comes a time
Got no patience to search for peace of mind
Layin' low, want to take it slow
No more hiding or disguising truths I've sold

Everyday it's something
Hits me all so cold
Find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, that I know

It's okay, had a bad day
Hands are bruised from breaking rocks all day
Drained and blue, I bleed for you
You think it's funny? Well, you're drowning in it too

Everyday it's something
Hits me all so cold
Find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, that I know

Yeah, it's fine, we'll walk down the line
Leave our rain, a cold trade for warm sunshine
You, my friend, I will defend
And if we change, well I'll love you anyway

Everyday it's something
Hits me all so cold
Find me sittin' by myself
No excuses, that I knowEmbed
