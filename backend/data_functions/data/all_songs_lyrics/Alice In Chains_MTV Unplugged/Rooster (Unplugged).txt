Rooster (Unplugged) Lyrics
Ooh-hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh oohoo
Ooh-hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh oohoo

Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere

Here they come to snuff the Rooster
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die


Here they come to snuff the Rooster
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die
Walking tall machine gun man
They spit on me in my home land
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy
Got my pills 'gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathing his dying breath
Oh, God, please won't you help me make it through

Here they come to snuff the Rooster, ah yeah
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no, you know he ain't gonna die

Ooh-hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-hoo1Embed
