Push Up on Me Lyrics
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down

It's getting later baby, and I'm getting curious
Nobody's looking at us, I feel delirious
'Cause the beat penetrates my body
Shaking inside my bones
And you're pushing all my buttons
Taking me out of my zone, yeah

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me
I know many guys just like you, extremely confident
Got so much flavor with you, like you're the perfect man
You wanna make me chase you, like it's a compliment
But let's get right down to it
I can be the girl that'll break you down

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing
And let's play a game, I won't be a tease
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing

I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would push up on me
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me

We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
I wanna see how you move it
Show me, show me how you do it
You really got me on it, I must confess (I must confess)
Baby, there ain't nothing to it
Baby, who you think you're fooling?
You wanna come and get me outta my dress, oh

The way that you stare, starts the fire in me (The way you stare at me)
Come up to my room, you sexy little thing (Sexy little thing)
And let's play a game (Yeah), I won't be a tease (No, baby)
I'll show you the boom, my sexy little thing (Oh-oh-oh)

I wish you would push up on me (I wish you would)
I wish you would push up on me (I wish you would)
I wish you would light me up (Light me up)
And say you want me
Push up on me (And say you want me)
I wish you would push up on me (I wish you would)
I wish you would push up on me (Oh-oh)
I wish you would light me up and say you want me
Push up on me (Light me up)

We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down
We break, break
We break, break
We break, break
We're breaking down3Embed
