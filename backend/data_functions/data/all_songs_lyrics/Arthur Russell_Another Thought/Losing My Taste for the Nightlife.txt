Losing My Taste for the Nightlife Lyrics
Well I'm driving to town
But I'm on the same road that took me back to home
Put me on the road
Now I'm heading for nothing 'cause its no more fun
Going down through the pines, what I'm doing I did before
And that's all I see
Driving, driving sixteen miles
I'm looking for something I don't want to do
Because my coming to town it took me from you
Now I'm losing my taste for the night life

Losing my taste for the night life
Losing my taste for the night life

Now I feel like an island
A man in a whorehouse
And I'm back again
I go back to the highland, I go back to the farmhouse
And the hills of grain
And I wonder at all
Where I would be
If I can't go and find you there
Well I wondered so long
To find you and how
I go standing in where I am right now

Try it once if you need to
Come back and then you can
Take it out on me
It's the same it could lead you
By all that is what two can do
And still be free
You've been gone such a long time
Now I know it's for real
And how sad or how good
And how I feel
