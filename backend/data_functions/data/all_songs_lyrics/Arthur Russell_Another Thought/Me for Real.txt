Me for Real LyricsTo me
I can and I do
Do what I want
When I want to
Now I want to
To me
I made it up to you
What I said to you
Is not true
Now it is true
In my heart beating
Beating far
Into the far, far future
In the mud that's on the tire
On that sunny morning
What a day before
Riding bikes is so intense
The foreign word
That says
Me for real
Its me
Still on my bike
Love is turning
Do it again
It's you that I like
Do you you say it's not true
Do what I want
When I want to
Now I want to
In my heart beating
Beating far
Into the far, far future
Me for real
Me for realEmbed
