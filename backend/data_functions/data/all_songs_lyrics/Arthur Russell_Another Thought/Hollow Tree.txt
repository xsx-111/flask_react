Hollow Tree LyricsIf you take me out to the single road
I'm gonna tell you how this love is gonna grow
Because every time you get to kissing me
I've got to squeeze you tighter and you start to see
We could live together in a hollow tree
And be happy people for eternity
Oh so sincere
And you can't have me
I go with you
And it's my favorite thing to
Tell you once or twice, tell you once again
You can tell me where, and I can tell you when
'Cause every time you get to kissing me
I start to squeeze you tighter and you start to see
We could live together in a hollow tree
And be happy people for eternity
So sincere
That you can't have me
I go with you
And it's my favorite thing to do
If you take me out to the single road
I'm gonna tell you how this love is gonna grow
Because every time you get to kissing me
I've got to squeeze you tighter and you start to see
We could live together in a hollow tree
And be happy people for eternityEmbed
