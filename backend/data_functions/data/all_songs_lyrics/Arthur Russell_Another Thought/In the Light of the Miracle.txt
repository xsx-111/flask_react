In the Light of the Miracle LyricsHolding in the light of the miracle
Holding in the light of the miracle
Living in the light of a miracle
Living in the light of a miracle
Holding in the light, in the pouring rain
Holding in the light, in the thunder
Take me with you
I want to be up there with you, seeing more
Holding in the light of a miracle
Living in the light
Lightening, light, light
If you could sing it to me
The thunder and the light
And how I know it to me
We certainly do it right
Holding in the light of the miracle
Reaching in the light
Riding in the light
Reaching in the light
Calling in the light
Living in the light of a miracle
Light, in the light
Living in the light of a miracle
Light, in the light
Since everything as far as I can see
Is part of you and that's all
Since everything I see turns out to be
Just another part of you
I love you and that's all, living in the light
I know that's all living in the light
Every part of me is from your last call, living in the light
I know that you are with me, living in the light
Because everywhere I see you1Embed
