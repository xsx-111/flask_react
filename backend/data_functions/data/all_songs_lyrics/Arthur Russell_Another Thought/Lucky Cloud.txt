Lucky Cloud LyricsLucky cloud in your sky
A lot of fun, yeah
Push and I go overboard
Lucky cloud in your sky
A little rain, babe
Lucky cloud in your sky
A little rain
Lucky cloud in your sky
A lot of fun, yeah
Lucky cloud in your sky
A lot of fun, yeah
(Okay punch in now)
(Yes, absolutely)
Lucky cloud in your sky
A lot of fun, yeah
Lucky cloud in your sky
A lot of fun, yeah
Lucky cloud in your sky
A little rain
Lucky cloud in your sky
A lot of fun (punch it up)
Lucky cloud in your sky
A lot of fun
Lucky cloud in your sky
A little rain, babe
Lucky cloud in your sky
A little rain, babe (punch in)
Lucky cloud in your sky
A little rain, babe
Lucky cloud in your sky
A lot of fun
Leave it alone, lucky cloud
Leave it alone, lucky sky
Lucky cloud in your sky
Leave it alone, leave it alone
Kissing I go up on lucky cloud
Leave it alone, kissing the sky, yeahEmbed
