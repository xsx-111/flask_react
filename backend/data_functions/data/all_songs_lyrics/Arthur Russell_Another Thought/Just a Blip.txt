Just a Blip LyricsIt's just a blip, that's all
Just a head trip, that's all
My big feeling as far as it goes
Plus a big kiss
That's your big surprise
It's just a blip, that's all
Just a head trip, that's all
It's just a blip
Just a head trip, that's all
It's just a brief infatuation
Now we give a lot to realize it
Plus a big kiss
It's your big surprise
It's just a blip, that's all
Just a head trip, that's all
My big feeling, as hard as it goes
You take it from me
The second I know
Working so hard to realize it
It's a big kiss
It's your big surprise
Just a head trip, that's all
It's just a blip, yeah
Just a head trip, that's all
It's just a brief infatuationEmbed
