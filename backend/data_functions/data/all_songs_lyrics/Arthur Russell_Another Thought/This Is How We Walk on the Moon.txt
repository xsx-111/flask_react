This Is How We Walk on the Moon LyricsEach step is moving, it's moving me up
Moving, it's moving me up
Every step is moving me up
I'm moving me up
Moving, moving me up
Every step is moving me up
Each step is moving
It's moving me up
Moving me up
One tiny, tiny, tiny move
It's all I need and I jump over
Every step is moving me up
It's moving me up
Moving, it's moving me up
Each step is moving, moving me up
Moving, moving me up
Every step is moving me up
This is how we walk on the moon
This is how we walk on the moon
This is how we walk on the moon
Each step is moving, moving me up
Moving, it's moving me up
Every step is moving me up
I'm so far away
One moment there
Moving me up
Every step is moving me up
One moment there
One tiny, tiny, tiny move
It's all I need and I jump overEmbed
