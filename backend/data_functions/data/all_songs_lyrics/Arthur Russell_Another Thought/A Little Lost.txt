A Little Lost Lyrics
I'm a little lost without you
That could be an understatement
Now I hope that I have paid the cost
To let a day go on by and not call on you

'Cause I'm so busy, so busy
Thinking about kissing you
Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought

Out on the ocean surf
I'll have to pull myself together
Now it's harder I'm not on my turf
Just me and me and those big old waves rolling in

'Cause I'm so busy, so busy
Thinking about kissing you
Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought

It's so unfinished, our love affair
A voice in me is telling me to run away
I hope your feelings isn't diminished
I hope you need someone in your life
Someone like me
'Cause I'm so busy, so busy
Thinking about kissing you
Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought

I'm a little lost without you
That could be an understatement
Now I hope that I have paid the cost
To let a day go on by and not call on you

'Cause I'm so busy, so busy
Thinking about kissing you
Now I want to do that
Without entertaining another thought2Embed
