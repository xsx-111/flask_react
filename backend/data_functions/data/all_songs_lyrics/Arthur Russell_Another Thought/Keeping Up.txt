Keeping Up LyricsKeeping, keeping, keeping, keeping
Keeping up, keeping up, keeping up
You like it when they look at you
You like it that I can't catch you
Keeping up, keeping up with the feeling
Oh yeah, getting to know what you like
And what you love
Keeping up, keeping up, I'm trying to keep up
When there's when there's no end in sight
Keeping up, trying keep up
Keeping up, trying keep up
Wanted to see what makes me go
And keep on going
When there's no end in sight
Heartbeat in me
Won't go slow
Not when it's knowing
That you might be back tonight
Keeping up
With the love, yeah
Can't believe you now
Thought about that
Can't believe me now
Forgot about that
You can't believe in love
Forgot about that
That you're letting me try
Keeping up, keeping up, trying to keep upEmbed
