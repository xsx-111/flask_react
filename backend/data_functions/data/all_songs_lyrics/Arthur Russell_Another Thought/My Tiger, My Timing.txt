My Tiger, My Timing LyricsWhere my tiger is
Where he is on his
His sneakers so white
Where my tiger is
Where he is
My tiger, my timing, my tiger, my timing
Let's go down where the love is
Let's find out how it feels
Let's go now where the fun is
With the red paint on your sneakers
Love in there, love in there
It's so fine
The feeling shines and shines
Love in there, love in there
It's so fine
The feeling shines and shines
Let's go now where the fun is
Let's find out how it feels
Let's go now where the fun is
My tiger, my timing
Joke shoes will turn up
Turn up seems like it will be a song tie
And it will alternate
The same as we, so far
Have tried
The same as we leave
That puts me in that full up can
Be on full time, timing, oh
Sun and just us will be fun
My tiger, my timing, my tiger, my timingEmbed
