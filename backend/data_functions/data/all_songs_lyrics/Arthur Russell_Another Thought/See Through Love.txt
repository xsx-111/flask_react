See Through Love LyricsWe are a see-through love
Seeing through sun and haze
We are a see-through love
Seeing through sun and haze
We are a see-through love
Seeing through sun and haze
I see through to the totally clear end
It appears within the second side
The word imagination
If you appear, the word allows a man
To settle for those appearing
If you appear what's sorry
Sends a friend to my imagination
The kind of town where it's a sin to be
Inside and outside for them
Around the side of the house where they hide
That you can get up on it
When every inter-call decides a well
That's up to go off
We are a see-through love
Seeing through sun and haze
I see through to the totally clear end
It's well to know that since it gives a name
You get to grow up with him
I finished all suppose where it's a good time
Floating where so much up
The kind of love that I can only find
In my imagination
The kind of heart that I can only have
In my imagination
We are a see-through love
Seeing through sun and haze1Embed
