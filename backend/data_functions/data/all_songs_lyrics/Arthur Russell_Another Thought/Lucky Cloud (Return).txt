Lucky Cloud (Return) LyricsLucky cloud in your sky
A little rain
A lot of fun
One kiss and I go overboard
I will find
More to see
I will see
More to find
It's a two way, two way street
The more I look ahead
The more I see behind
Lucky cloud in your sky
A little rain
A lot of fun
One, one kiss and I go overboard
What a day
As the sun peeps around round the cloud
That's in the way
Like a two way, two way street
The weather at a point will show me what you will say
Lucky cloud in your sky
A little rain
A lot of fun
One kiss and I go overboard
I see your light touch my eyes
And then the rest
Is history
One kiss and I go...Embed
