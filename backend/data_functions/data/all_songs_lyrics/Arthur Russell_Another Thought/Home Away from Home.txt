Home Away from Home LyricsYou, you can come with me
Pointing to my home away from home
Now every twinkling light that's in the sky
By looking up when you need to know
You will see that from looking, looking up
You will be able to do it again
Home away from home, home away from home, home away from home
The rest is in the center
It comes to take you to the treetops
You can come with me
Pointing to my home away from home
....crossing, crossing through
But every twinkling light that's in the sky
But every twinkling light that's in the sky
But every twinkling light that's in the sky
The birth of the moment
Is never ending
Home away from home, home away from home
Home away from home, home away from home
The rest is in the center
It comes to take you to the treetops
You can come with me
Pointing to my home away from homeEmbed
