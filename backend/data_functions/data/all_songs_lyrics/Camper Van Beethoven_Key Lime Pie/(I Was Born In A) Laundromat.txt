(I Was Born In A) Laundromat LyricsDown here on the north side
I'm rattling with a tin
Down here on the river boat
I got sand in my shoes
It's hotter than asphalt
It's harder than pistols
I'm as bent as a crowbar
We all want some release
Just like the queen of the trailer park
Sometimes she's the queen of the water, of the river
Down here on the tracks
We're the kings of the trash
I was born in a laundromat
I was born in a cul-de-sac
And some of us are brown
And some of us are white
Just give me some tension release
Just give me some tension release
Just like the queen of the trailer park
Sometimes she's the queen of the water, of the river
Down here on the tracks
We're the kings of the trash
She's the queen of the primo
She's the queen of the bondo
And I was born in a laundromat
I was born in a cul-de-sac
Just give me some tension release
Just give me some tension release
Just like the queen of the trailer park
Sometimes she's the queen of the water, of the riverEmbed
