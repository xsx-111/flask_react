Sweethearts Lyrics'Cause he's always living back in Dixon
Circa nineteen forty-nine
And we're all sitting at the fountain
At the five and dime
'Cause he's living in some B-movie
The lines they are so clearly drawn
In black and white life is so easy
And we're all coming along on this one
'Cause he's on a secret mission
Headquarters just radioed in
He left his baby at the dancehall
While the band plays on, some sweet song
And on a mission over China
The lady opens up her arms
The flowers bloom where you have placed them
And the lady smiles, just like mom
Angels' wings are icing over
McDonnell Douglas olive drab
They bear the names of our sweethearts
And the captain smiles, as we crash
'Cause in the mind of Ronald Reagan
Wheels they turn and gears they grind
Buildings collapse in slow motion
And trains collide, everything is fine
Everything is fine
Everything is fineEmbed
