Pictures of Matchstick Men Lyrics
When I look up to the sky
I see your eyes
A funny kind of yellow
Rush home to bed
I soak my head
I see your face underneath my pillow
I woke next morning
Tired, still yawning
See your face looking through my window

Pictures of matchstick men and you
Images of matchstick men and you
Alls I ever see is them and you

Windows echo your reflection
When I look in their direction now
There your face is haunting me
Your face just won't leave me alone

Pictures of matchstick men and you
Images of matchstick men and you
All I ever see is them and you
You're in the sky
You're with this guy
You make men cry
You are, you're in the sky
You're with this guy
You make men cry
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
Pictures of matchstick men
