June LyricsAre you weary of the lengthening days?
Do you secretly wish for November's rain
And the harvest moon to wane in the sky?
There is nothing in this world more bitter than spring
And I wrote you this letter
'cause the clothes were hung on the line
And the crows flew out of the field and up into the sky
I'm lying here in the station
Stretching out on the tracks
Are all the possible places that I might arrive
There is nothing in this world more bitter than love
In all those long days of June
Bring me the long brown grass, now that it's dry
There is nothing in this world more bitter than springEmbed
