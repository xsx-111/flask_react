Cold Wind to Valhalla (Live) LyricsAnd ride with us young bonny lass
With the angels of the night
Crack wind clatter, flesh rein bite on an out-size unicorn
Rough-shod winging sky blue flight on a cold wind to Valhalla
And join with us please
Valkyrie maidens cry above the cold wind to Valhalla
Break fast with the gods
Night angels serve with ice-bound majesty
Frozen flaking fish raw nerve
In a cup of silver liquid fire
Moon jet brave beam split ceiling
Swerve and light the old Valhalla
Come join with us please
Valkyrie maidens cry above the cold wind to Valhalla
The heroes rest upon the sighs of Thor's trusty hand maidens
Midnight lonely whisper cries
We're getting a bit short on heroes lately
Sword snap fright white pale goodbyes in the desolation of Valhalla
And join with us please
Valkyrie maidens ride empty-handed
On the cold wind to ValhallaEmbed
