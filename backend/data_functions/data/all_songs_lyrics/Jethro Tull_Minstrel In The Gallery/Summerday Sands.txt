Summerday Sands LyricsI once met a girl with the life in her hands
And we lay together on the summerday sands
I gave her my raincoat and told her, Lady, be good!
And we made truth together, where no one else would
I smiled through her fingers and ran the dust through her hands ---
The hour-glass of reason on the summerday sands
We sat as the sea caught fire
Waited as the flames grew higher
In her eyes
We watched the eagle born ---
Wings clipped, tail feathers shorn
But we saw him rise ---
Over summerday sands
Came the ten o'clock curfew
She said, I must start my car
I'm staying with someone I met last night in a bar
I called from my wave top ---
At least tell me your name!
She smiled from her wheelspin
And said, It's all the same
I thought for a minute, jumped back on dry land ---
Left one set of footprints on the summerday sands
I once met a girl with the life in her hands
And we lied together on the summerday sandsEmbed
