Cold Wind to Valhalla Lyrics(This one's called 'Cold Wind to Valhalla')
And ride with us young bonny lass
With the angels of the night
Crack wind clatter, flesh-rein bite
On an outsize unicorn
Roughshod winging sky-blue flight
On a cold wind to Valhalla
And join with us please — Valkyrie maidens cry
Above the cold wind to Valhalla
Breakfast with the gods — Night angels serve
With ice-bound majesty
Frozen flaking fish raw nerve
In a cup of silver liquid fire
Moon jet brave beam split ceiling swerve
And light the old Valhalla
Come join with us please — Valkyrie maidens cry
Above the cold wind to Valhalla
The heroes rest upon the sighs
Of Thor's trusty handmaidens
Midnight lonely whisper cries
We're getting a bit short on heroes lately
Sword snap fright white pale goodbyes
In the desolation of Valhalla
And join with us please — Valkyrie maidens ride
Empty-handed on the cold wind to ValhallaEmbed
