March the Mad Scientist LyricsWhat would you like for Christmas ---
A new polarity?
You're binary, and desperate to deal in high figures
That lick us with their hotter flame ---
Lick each and everyone the same
And March, the mad scientist, rings a new change in ever-dancing colours
He rings it here and he rings it...
But no one stops to see
The change of fate and the fate of change that slips into his pocket ---
So he locks it all away from view and shares not what he thought you knew
And April is summer-bound
And February's blue
And no one stops to see the coloursEmbed
