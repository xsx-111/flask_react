Requiem LyricsWell, I saw a bird today
Flying from a bush
And the wind blew it away;
And the black-eyed mother sun
Scorched the butterfly at play -
Velvet-veined;
I saw it burn
With a wintry storm-blown sigh
A silver cloud blew right on by;
And, taking in the morning, I sang
"O Requiem"
Well, my lady told me, "Stay."
I looked aside and walked away
Along the strand
But I didn't say a word
As the train time-table blurred
Close behind the taxi stand
Saw her face in the tear-drop black cab window
Fading into the traffic; Watched her go;
And, taking in the morning, heard myself singing:
"O Requiem"
Here I go again;
It's the same old story
Di-di-di
Well, I saw a bird today;
I looked aside and walked away
Along the strandEmbed
