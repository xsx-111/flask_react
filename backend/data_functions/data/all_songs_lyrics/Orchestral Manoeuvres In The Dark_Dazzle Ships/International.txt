International Lyrics
The youth and Anti-Imperialist Tribune was also addressed by a young girl from Nicaragua whose hands had been cut off at the wrists by the former Somoza guards
Veronika Merko, of the German Federal Republic, had this to say:
"Also, ich habe eine Ausbildung gemacht als Industriekaufmann und wurde nach der Lehre nicht uebernommen"

Now and then
A little thing gets by
Now and then
We'll cry

Like a fall in the war
Like a mother's open arms
Like a pawn in a game
Hard to take

There we sit on a line
Wasting fortunes at a time
And pray

All the time we are gone
There's no reason
There's no way
Oh the soul is the one
So they say
There we sit on a line
Wasting fortunes at a time
And play

She never thought
He'd be this way
Her arms aloft
She holds
But now it's all a memory
And it's goneEmbed
