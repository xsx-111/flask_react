Telegraph Lyrics
I've got a telegraph
In my hand
Words on paper
Written in sand

We've got telegraph (We've got telegraph)
Right across this land (All across this land)
It doesn't mean a damn thing
We don't understand
But who needs telegraph anyway?

I've got a telegraph (I've got a telegraph)
In my hand (In my hand)
Words on paper (Words on paper)
Written in sand (Written in sand)

We've got telegraph (We've got telegraph)
Right across this land (All across this land)
It doesn't mean a damn thing (It doesn't mean a thing)
We don't understand (We never understand)

(Telegraph) God's got telegraph
On his side (On his side)
(Telegraph) It makes him powerful
Gives him pride (Gives him pride)
Even in America (God bless America)
They understand (They understand)
The value of telegraph (The value of telegraph)
Hand in hand (Hand in hand)Embed
