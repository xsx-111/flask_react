Silent Running Lyrics
God only knows
This isn't heaven
The promises made
He never kept them

We're walking on air
We're taking our time
But God only knows
This isn't reason or rhyme

I've had this feeling
I don't believe it
It's happened before
I just reject it

We're walking on air
We're taking our time
But God only knows
This isn't reason or rhyme

These are the feelings
I know their outcome
It's useless pretending
I'd like to beat them
We're walking on air
We're taking our time
But God only knows
This isn't reason or rhyme

We're walking on air
We're taking our time
But God only knows
This isn't reason or rhyme

We're walking on airEmbed
