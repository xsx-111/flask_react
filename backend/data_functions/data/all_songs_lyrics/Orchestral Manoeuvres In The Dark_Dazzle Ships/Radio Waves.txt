Radio Waves Lyrics
From the transmitter
To the receiver
Across the ether
Out of your speaker

Radio waves have life
Radio waves have life
Machines are living too
Working for me and you

From the transmitter
To the receiver
Across the ether
Out of your speaker
To the Baltic Fleet
And Atlantic Fleet
Faster than the breeze
Over stormy seas

Radio waves have life
Radio waves have life
Machines are living too
Working for me and you
Radio waves have life
Radio waves have life
Machines are living too
Working for me and you

Through America
To Albania
Over Reagan's head
Under Moscow's bed
To the Warsaw Pact
And the NATO Pact
Down this cul-de-sac
Never turning back

Radio waves have life
Radio waves have life
Machines are living too
Working for me and youEmbed
