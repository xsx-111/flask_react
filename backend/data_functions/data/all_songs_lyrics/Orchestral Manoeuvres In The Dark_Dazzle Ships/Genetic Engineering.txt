Genetic Engineering Lyrics
Efficient, logical, effective, and practical
Using all resources to the best of our ability
Changing, designing, adapting our mentalities
Improving our abilities for a better way of life

Babies, mother, hospital, scissors
Creature, judgement, butcher, engineer

These are the little children
The future in our hands
When all God's children on this Earth
Inherit all our plans
These are the lies they tell us
But this is the only way
When all God's children on the Earth
Will ever more be saved

Babies, mother, hospital, scissors
Creature, judgement, butcher, engineer
Babies, mother, hospital, scissors
Creature, judgement, butcher, engineer
These are the little children
The future's in their hands
When all God's children on this Earth (Creature, judgement, butcher, engineer)
Inherit all our plans
These are the lies they tell us (Creature, judgement, butcher, engineer)
The future's good as sold
For all the things we do and know (Creature, judgement, butcher, engineer)
We really must be told

Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh1Embed
