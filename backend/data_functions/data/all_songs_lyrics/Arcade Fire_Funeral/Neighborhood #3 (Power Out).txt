Neighborhood #3 (Power Out) Lyrics
I woke up with the power out
Not really something to shout about
Ice has covered up my parents' hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are swinging from the power lines
Nobody's home, so nobody minds

I woke up on the darkest night
Neighbors all were shouting that they found the light
(We found the light!)
Shadows jumping all over my walls
Some of them big, some of them small
I went out into the night
I went out to pick a fight with anyone
Light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ, don't keep it hid!

Hoo-oo
Hoo-oo
Hoo-oo
Ice has covered up my parents' hands
Don't have any dreams, don't have any plans
Growing up in some strange storm
Nobody's cold, nobody's warm
I went out into the night
I went out to find some light
Kids are dying out in the snow
Look at them go, look at them go!

Hoo-oo
Hoo-oo
Hoo-oo
Oo-oo

And the power's out in the heart of man
Take it from your heart, put it in your hand, hand
What's the plan?
What's the plan?

Is it a dream? Is it a lie?
I think I'll let you decide
Just light a candle for the kids
Jesus Christ, don't keep it hid!
Because nothing's hid
From us kids!
You ain't fooling nobody
With the lights out!
And the power's out in the heart of man
Take it from your heart, put it in your hand
And there's something wrong in the heart of man
You take it from your heart and put it in your hand!
Where'd you go?6Embed
