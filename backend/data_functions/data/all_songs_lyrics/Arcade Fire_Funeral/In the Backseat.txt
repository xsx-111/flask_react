In the Backseat Lyrics
I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside
And I can fall asleep

My family tree's
Losing all its leaves
Crashing towards the driver's seat
The lightning bolt made enough heat
To melt the street beneath your feet

Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning

I like the peace
In the backseat
I don't have to drive
I don't have to speak
I can watch the countryside...
Alice died
In the night
I've been learning to drive
My whole life
I've been learning. O-oh..!

Hoo-oo-ooh! Hoo-oo-ooh!
No-or-aaah!
Hoo-oo-ooh! Hoo-oo-ooh...!9Embed
