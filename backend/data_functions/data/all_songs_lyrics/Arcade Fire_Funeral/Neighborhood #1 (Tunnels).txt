Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) Lyrics
And if the snow buries my
My neighborhood
And if my parents are crying
Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours
Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours
You climb out the chimney and meet me in the middle
The middle of the town
And since there's no one else around, we let our hair grow long
And forget all we used to know
Then our skin gets thicker from living out in the snow

You change all the lead, sleeping in my head
As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn

Then we tried to name our babies but we forgot all the names that...
The names we used to know
But sometimes we remember our bedrooms and our parent's bedrooms
And the bedrooms of our friends
Then we think of our parents, well, what ever happened to them?

You change all the lead, sleeping in my head to gold
As the day grows dim, I hear you sing a golden hymn
It’s the song I’ve been trying to sing
Purify the colors, purify my mind
Purify the colors, purify my mind
And spread the ashes of the colors over this heart of mine!22Embed
