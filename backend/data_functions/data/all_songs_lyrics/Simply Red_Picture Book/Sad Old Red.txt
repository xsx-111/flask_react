Sad Old Red LyricsI walk on stone, it leads me home
We don't have streets, just pure concrete
I'm not glad when I get home
I'm sad old Red, I don't wanna be alone
Chorus:
Sad old Red, sat at home
Sad old Red, living on his own
Sad old Red, sat at home
Sad old Red, let me take you home
It's a cubic room, two hole peep through
Shadows on the wall of trees so tall
I think of her again, the joy she used to bring
Lay there in bed two words she said
She said "Oh Red" (repeat)
Sad old Red, that's what I am
All the time, every night
Sad old RedEmbed
