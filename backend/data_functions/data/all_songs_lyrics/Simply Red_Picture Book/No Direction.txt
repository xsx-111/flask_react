No Direction LyricsSinging hymns on road and pavements
Hungry Jims, no one saves them
Walkin' north, talkin' south
With firm intention
And I don't know what I'm talking about
It's firm intention
Chorus:
In this dreary life, with no direction
What this cause says about my life
And no direction, no direction!!!
To enter a place like an alien
To leave a place like an alien
What's this calling? What's this calling?
Firm intention
Better feel it, better believe it
Firm intension
-chorus-
Watch that feeling, watch that feeling
Or I'll grab it, or I'll grab it
Watch that feeling, watch that feeling
Or I'll grab it, or I'll grab it
-chorus-Embed
