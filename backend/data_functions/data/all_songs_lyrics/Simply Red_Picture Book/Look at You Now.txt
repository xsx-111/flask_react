Look at You Now LyricsLook at you now
Look at you now
Look at you now
Look at you now
Look at you now
Look at you now
Right from the start
You tried to hurt me
But look at you now, behaving like a fool
A long time ago you treated me so mean but
Chorus:
Look at you now
Look at you now
Look at you now
Look at you now
You threw me away like litter in the gutter
I had to pick my self up and find something better
I looked so hard (Look at you now)
I'm looking hard now (Look at you now)
Looking at your head
Don't talk about birthdays, that don't mean a thing to me
Don't throw it in my face, it's too sweet to sting
(Look at you now)I kept on looking hard
Looking at your head, head!!!
Look at you nowEmbed
