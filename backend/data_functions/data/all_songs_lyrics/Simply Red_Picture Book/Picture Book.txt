Picture Book LyricsMany types came to see the picture
Many types came to see the picture
Only he had the right to come
Only he is long gone
Will or win or wicked, it's written in it
(repeat)
Quivering in mutual agression
Women sing remembering affection
Only he had the right to come
Only he is long gone
Will or win or wicked, it's written in it
(repeat)
Here by the side of the book
(We beseech thee, we beseech thee.)
Here by the side of Piero's spiritEmbed
