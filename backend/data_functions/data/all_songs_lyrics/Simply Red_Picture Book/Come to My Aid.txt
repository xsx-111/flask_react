Come to My Aid Lyrics
Come to my aid
You're sweet as everything
Come to my aid
I'd give you everything
I feel so betrayed
By the people I love
Come to my aid
It's you I'm thinking of, oh yeah
You I'm thinkin' of oh now
Prouder than the wild
Sad enough to sing, oh hear me now
Come to my aid
And care for social living
Oh you better care now

Why are we liable
To die for survival?
Why is our nation divided?
Come to my aid
Come to my aid
Come to my aid
Come to my aid
In the poverty stakes
See just what it means?
Look out enough
When welfare decimates
You better care about fellow people

Why are we liable
To die for survival?
Why is our nation divided?
Come to my aid
Come to my aid
Come to my aid
Come to my aid
My aid
My aid
My aid
My aid oh man
Come on board yeah
Come on board yeah
Come on board yeah
You'd better come on board now
Come on boardEmbed
