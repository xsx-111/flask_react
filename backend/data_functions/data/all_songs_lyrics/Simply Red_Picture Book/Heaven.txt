Heaven LyricsEv'ryone is trying to get to the bar
The name of the bar
The bar is called Heaven
The band in Heaven
They play my favourite song
They play it once again
They play it all night long
Chorus:
Heaven
Heaven is a place
A place where nothing
Nothing ever happens
-chorus-
There is a party, everyone is there
Everyone will leave at exactly the same time
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun
-chorus-
-chorus-
When this kiss is over it will start again
It will not be any different, it will be exactly the same
It's hard to imagine that nothing at all
Could be so exciting, could be so much fun
-chorus-Embed
