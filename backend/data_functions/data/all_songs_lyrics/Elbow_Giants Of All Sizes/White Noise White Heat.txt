White Noise White Heat Lyrics
I was born with a trust
That didn't survive the white noise of the lies
The white heat of injustice has taken my eyes
I just wanna get high

I am the great collector
I tally catalogue and hold to the light
Forgotten scenes of love
Some of them were mine
All mine
I pick the broken dreams
That hang in city centre trees
All the love made urgently
That gathers in the gutters of your mind
Some of it was mine
All mine

I was born with a trust
That didn't survive the white noise of the lies
The white heat of injustice has taken my eyes
I just wanna get high
I was born with a trust
That didn't survive the white noise of the lies
The white heat of injustice has taken my eyes
I just wanna get high

I tried to save the world silly boy
By sullen girl with love as a given
Driven by my certainty
That they'd never beat it out of me
But who am I some Blarney Mantovani
With a lullaby when the sky is falling in?
I believe I'm giving in
Oh, the coldness of space
With a suit that could do it

I was born with a trust
That didn't survive the white noise of the lies
The white heat of injustice has taken my eyes
I just wanna get high
I was born with a trust
That didn't survive the white noise of the lies
The white heat of injustice has taken my eyes
I just wanna get high1Embed
