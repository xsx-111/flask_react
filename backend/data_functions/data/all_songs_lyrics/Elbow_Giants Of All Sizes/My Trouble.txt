My Trouble Lyrics
Any mist on the common ground
Will lift with a kiss
Our love is these days piano
Oh, there's oceans of tea
And years of TV
But I miss you
My trouble is
I miss you, my trouble
I miss you
My trouble is
I miss you, my trouble

Just this morning alone with you worth
A lifetime alone on this earth

Come get me
Guide and check me
Sail and wreck me
Soak me to my skin

There will come a time when you and I
Are invisible to all but you and me
And I'll sing each line that appears with the years
'Til there's countless rings on our proud old tree
And I'll always get hold of you
My heart at the double
I miss you
My trouble is
I miss you, my trouble
Just this morning alone with you worth
A lifetime alone on this earth

Come get me
Guide and check me
Sail and wreck me
Soak me to my skin
Come get me
Guide and check me
Sail and wreck me
Soak me to my skin
Come get me
Guide and check me
Sail and wreck me
Soak me to my skin
Come get me
Guide and check me
Sail and wreck me
Soak me to my skinEmbed
