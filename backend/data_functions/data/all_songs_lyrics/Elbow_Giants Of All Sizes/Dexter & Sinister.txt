Dexter & Sinister LyricsAnd I don't know Jesus anymore
And an endless sleep is awaiting me
And I haven't finished yet
And I'm not a dog for the end of days
I'm a bird in a hurricane
With the heaviest heart jackhammering in me
And I don't know Jesus anymore
(Once again)
Unstuck and the whole archipelago is rocking like a suicide pedalo at high tide
Blazing eyes hey how' d'ya keep your eyes ablaze
In these faith free, hope free, charity free days
Come back to the light
Come pull on the bullwhip around my heart
Take me to the sea
Let me peel and fade by the seaside
Where dead men go to die
And long standing affairs fizzle in the brine
And everybody stares with Eastwood eyes at the horizon
And I haven't finished yet
Loss is a part of life this long
But Dexter and Sinister?
I've the heaviest heart jackhammering in me
And I don't know Jesus anymore
And I don't know Jesus anymore1Embed
