Seven Veils Lyrics
I see ahead by a hundred moves
And I saw you, but I let you saw me in two
'Cause that's what illusionists do
The way you kissed me when you lost another valentine
The way you kissed me when you lost another valentine
The way you kissed me when you lost another valentine

There's no roses in this garden
No sun melting in the sea
I've been over and over and over and over it
You live for the final dance
Take your seven veils and sail the seven seas

Oh the roar and the whisper
In the focus of your stare
(Did we ever see or did I imagine harmony?)
The sordid rapture of draw and capture
Back to the four walls of your square

There's no roses in this garden
No sun melting in the sea
I've been over and over and over and over it
You live for the final dance
Take your seven veils and sail the seven seas
And don't come back for me
There's no roses in this garden
No sun melting in the sea
Over and over and over and over it
You live for the final dance
Take your seven veils and sail the seven seas

There's no roses in this garden
No sun melting in the sea
Over and over and over and over it
Take this final dance
Take your seven veils and sail the seven seasEmbed
