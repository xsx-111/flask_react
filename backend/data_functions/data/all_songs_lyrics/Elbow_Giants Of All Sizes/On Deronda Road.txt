On Deronda Road Lyrics
This day is made of hope and space
And home like I have never known
I found it in your perfect face
When we were on Deronda Road
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)

This day is made of hope and space
And home like I have never known
I found it in your perfect face
When we were on Deronda Road
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
(Home like I have never known)
This day is made of hope and space
And home like I have never known
I found it in your perfect face
When we were on Deronda RoadEmbed
