Weightless Lyrics
Hey
You look like me
So we
We look like him
When the time came
Just like you are
He was weightless
In my arms

(Captain)
(Oh my captain)
(Only love)

Hey
You look like me
So we
We look like him
When the time came
Just like you are
He was weightless
In my arms
He was weightless
In my armsEmbed
