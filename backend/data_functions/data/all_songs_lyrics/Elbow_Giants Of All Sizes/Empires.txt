Empires Lyrics
Baby
Empires crumble all the time
Pay it no mind
You just happened to witness mine
Don't let all the light fall from your eyes
Come come
Empires crumble all the time

How can a dismally typical Tuesday
Delivering blues with lead in its canopy
Scruff me pin me and let’s make a man of me
Turn up the pounding of the hearts all around
And I'm bound to get busy with checking on the living
And I'll wring out their hands and my eyes with the sobbing
But how can a bland unremarkable typical Tuesday be Day of the Dead?

Baby
Empires crumble all the time
Pay it no mind
You just happened to witness mine
Don’t let all the light fall from your eyes
Come come
Empires crumble all the time
How can a dismally typical Tuesday
Delivering blues with lead in its canopy
Scruff me pin me and let's make a man of me
Turn up the pounding of the hearts all around
And I'm bound to get busy with checking on the living
And I'll wring out their hands and my eyes with the sobbing
But how can a bland unremarkable typical Tuesday be Day of the Dead?

Baby
Empires crumble all the timeEmbed
