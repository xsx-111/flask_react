Doldrums Lyrics
Are you (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)
Quake awake? (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)
Are you (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)
Quake awake? (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)
Are you? (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)

Where in the world did you learn this behaviour, honey?
Wondering Yaletown a quarter to dead
Dead right and if you have the money
There's always a cat in a hat who can save you
From yourself and from the world
From making decisions using your head‚ head
Oh and what a pretty head

Draped in the veils and silks of the new world
A curling of jasmine smoke as you parade
Past the shuffle of desperate men on the corner
Singing all of this stuff in our veins is the same

You found you a bona fide synthesised saviour‚ honey
Found a vocation‚ got you a job
Maybe don't write the folks, don't write home
You're as blue as the sky and as sharp as a razor
On the move and on the edge and on your own
Staring down buses protected by God
Draped in the veils and silks of the new world
A curling of jasmine smoke as you parade
Past the shuffle of desperate men on the corner
Singing all of this stuff in our veins is the same
Like you were dragging a stick down the railings
Green eyes and rubbernecks covet and crane
You Moses the Red Sea of men on the corner
Singing all of this stuff in our veins is the same

Are you (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)
Quake awake? (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)
Are you (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)
Quake awake? (All of this stuff in our veins is the same)Embed
