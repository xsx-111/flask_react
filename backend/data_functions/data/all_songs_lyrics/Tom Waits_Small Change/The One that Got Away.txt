The One that Got Away LyricsThe jigolo's jumpin salty
Ain't no trade out on the streets
Half past the unlucky
And the hawk's a front row seat
Dressed in full orchestration
Stage door johnny's got to pay
And send him home
Talking bout the one that got away
Could a been on easy street
Could a been a wheel
With irons in the fire
And all them business deals
But the last of the big time losers
Shouted before he drove away
I'll be right back as soon as I crack
The one that got away
The ambulance drivers don't give a shit
They just want to get off work
And the short stop and the victim
Have already gone berserk
And the shroud tailor measures him
For a deep six holiday
The stiff is froze, the case is closed
On the one that got away
Jim Crow's directing traffic
With them cemetery blues
With those peculiar looking trousers
And them old Italian shoes
The wooden kimona was all ready
To drop in San Francisco bay
But now he's mumbling something
All about the one that got away
Costello was the champion
At the St. Moritz Hotel
And the best this side of Fairfax
Reliable sources tell
But his reputation is at large
And he's at Ben Frank's every day
Waiting for the one that got away
He's got a snake skin sportshirt
And he looks like Vincent Price
With a little piece of chicken
And he's carving off a slice
But someone tipped her off
She'll be doing a Houdini now any day
She shook his hustle
The Greyhound bus'll
Take the one that got away
Andre is at the piano
Behind the Ivar in the Sewers
With a buck a shot for pop tunes
And a fin for guided tours
He could of been in Casablanca
He stood in line out there all day
But now he's spilling whiskey
And learning songs about the one that got away
Well I've lost my equilibrium
My car keys and my pride
Tattoo parlor's warm
And so I huddle there inside
The grinding of the buzzsaw
Whatchuwanthathingtosay
Just don't misspell her name
Buddy she's the one that got awayEmbed
