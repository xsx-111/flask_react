I Wish I Was in New Orleans (in the Ninth Ward) LyricsWell, I wish I was in New Orleans
I can see it in my dreams
Arm-in-arm down Burgundy
A bottle and my friends and me
Hoist up a few tall cool ones
Play some pool and listen
To that tenor saxophone
Calling me home
And I can hear the band begin
"When the Saints Go Marching In"
And by the whiskers on my chin
New Orleans, I'll be there
I'll drink you under the table
Be red-nosed, go for walks
The old haunts
What I wants
Is red beans and rice
And wear the dress I like so well
And meet me at the old saloon
Make sure that there's a Dixie moon
New Orleans, I'll be there
And deal the cards roll the dice
If it ain't that old Chuck E. Weiss
And Claiborne Avenue
Me and you Sam Jones and all
And I wish I was in New Orleans
Cause I can see it in my dreams
Arm-in-arm down Burgundy
A bottle and my friends and me
New Orleans, I'll be there1Embed
