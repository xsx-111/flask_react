Bad Liver and a Broken Heart LyricsWell I got a bad liver and a broken heart
Yea I drunk me a river since you tore me apart
And I don't have a drinking problem
Cept when I can't get a drink
And I wish you'd a known her
We were quite a pair
She was sharp as a razor
And soft as a prayer
So welcome to the continuing saga
She was my better half
And I was just a dog
And so here am I slumped
I been chippied and I been chumped
On my stool
So buy this fool, some spirits and libations
It's these railroad station bars
With all these conductors and the porters
And I'm all out of quarters
And this epitaph is the aftermath
Yea I choose my path
Hey come on Cath, he's a lawyer
He ain't the one for ya
And no the moon ain't romantic
It's intimidating as hell
And some guy's tryin to sell
Me a watch
And so I'll meet you at the
Bottom of a bottle of
Bargain scotch
I got me a bottle and a dream
It's so maudlin it seems
You can name your poison
Go on ahead and make some noise
I ain't sentimental
This ain't a purchase it's a rental
And it's purgatory, hey
What's your story, well
I don't even care
Cause I got my own double-cross to bear
And I'll see your Red Label
And I'll raise you one more
And you can pour me a cab
I just can't drink no more
Cause it don't douse the flames
That are started by dames
It ain't like asbestos
It don't do nothing but
Rest us assured
And substantiate the rumors
That you've heardEmbed
