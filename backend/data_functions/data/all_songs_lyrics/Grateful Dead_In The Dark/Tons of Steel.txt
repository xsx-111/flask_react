Tons of Steel Lyrics
I know these rails we're on like I know my
Lady's smile
Re-see a dozen dreams in every passing mile
Can't begin to count the trips
That she and I have made
But I wish I had a dollar
For each time we've both been down this grade

Nine hundred thousand tons of steel
Made to roll
Her brakes don't work and this grade's so steep
Her engine's sure to blow
Nine hundred thousand tons of steel
Out of control
She's more a roller coaster than the train I used
To know

It's one hell of an understatement to say she
Can get mean
She's temperamental, more a bitch than a machine
She wasn't built to travel at
The speed a rumor flies
These wheels are bound to jump the tracks
Before they burn the ties

Murphy's sure outdone himself to pick this
Stretch of track
I can only hope my luck is riding in the back
Well I have prayed to God
This ain't the day we meet
I've done about everything
But try dragging my feet


Oo, oo, I wanna go down slow
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Nine hundred thousand tons of steel
Out of control
She's more a roller coaster than the train I used
To knowEmbed
