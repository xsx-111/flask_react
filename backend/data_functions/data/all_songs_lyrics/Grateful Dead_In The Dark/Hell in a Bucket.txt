Hell in a Bucket Lyrics
Well I was drinkin' last night with a biker
And I showed him a picture of you
I said, "Pal, get to know her. You'll like her"
Seemed like the least I could do...
'Cause when he's driving his chopper
Up and down your carpeted halls
You will think me by contrast quite proper
Never mind how I stumble and fall
Never mind how I stumble and fall

You imagine me sipping champagne from
Your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride

Now miss sweet little soft-core pretender
Somehow baby got hard as it gets
With her black leather chrome-spiked
Suspenders
Her chain and her whip and her pets
Well we know you're the reincarnation
Of the ravenous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love your ovations
For the Z-rated scenes you create
The Z-rated scenes you create

You imagine me sipping champagne from
Your boot
For a taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride
At least I'm enjoying the ride

You analyze me, pretend to despise me
You laugh when I stumble and fall
There may come a day I will dance on your grave
Unable to dance, I will crawl across it
Unable to dance, I'll still crawl
Unable to dance I'll crawl

You must really consider the circus
'Cause it just might be your kind of zoo
I can't think of a place that's more perfect
For a person as perfect as you
And it's not like I'm leaving you lonely
'Cause I wouldn't know where to begin
But I know that you'll think of me only
When the snakes come marching in
When the snakes come marching in

You imagine me sipping champagne from your boot
For taste of your elegant pride
I may be going to hell in a bucket, babe
But at least I'm enjoying the ride, at least I'll enjoy the ride
Ride, ride, ride 
At least I'll enjoy the ride 1Embed
