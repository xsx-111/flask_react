When Push Comes to Shove Lyrics
Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of bricks
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye
With Shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love

When push comes to shove, when push comes to shove
You're afraid of love, when push comes to shove

Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head
Are you still in fear of the hand beneath the bed?
Grabbing at the handle, scratching at the door
Maybe it's mystery killer you saw on channel four
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose
Put my arms around you, love you until you cry
Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you until you die
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
