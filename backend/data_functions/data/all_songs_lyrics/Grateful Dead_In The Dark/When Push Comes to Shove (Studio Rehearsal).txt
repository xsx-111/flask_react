When Push Comes to Shove (Studio Rehearsal) LyricsShaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of brick
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye
With shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that do not let you pass
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
When push comes to shove
When push comes to shove
You're afraid of love
When push comes to shove
Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head
Cringing like a baby at the hand beneath the bed?
Phantom in the closet, scratching at the door
Believe it's the mystery killer that you saw on channel four
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose
Twist their arms around you, snap you till you cry
Wrap you in their sweet perfume and love you 'til you die
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
When push comes to shove
When push comes to shove
You're afraid of love
When push comes to shove
When push comes to shove
When push comes to shove
You're afraid of love
When push comes to shoveEmbed
