West L.A. Fadeaway Lyrics
I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do 
I don't want to buy it
I just want to rent it for a minute or two
I met an old mistake walking down the street today 
I didn't want to be mean about it
I couldn't think of one good thing to say

West L.A. fadeaway, West L.A. fadeaway
Little red light on the highway, big green light on the speedway

Got a steady job moving items for the mob 
Know the pay's pathetic
It's a shame those boys couldn't be more copacetic


I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know 
Lord, just how far to go
West L.A. fadeaway, here's one chance you say
She tries to live by the Golden Rule
Said you treat other people right
Other people probably treat you coolEmbed
