West L.A. Fadeaway (1984 Alternate Version) LyricsI'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
I'm looking for a chateau, 21 rooms but one will do
I don't want to buy it
I just want to rent it for a minute or two
I met an old mistake walking down the street today
I met an old mistake walking down the street today
I didn't want to be mean about it
I couldn't think of one good thing to say
West L.A. fadeaway, West L.A. fadeaway
Big red light on the highway, little green light on the freeway
Got a steady job moving items for the mob
Got a steady job moving items for the mob
Know the pay's pathetic
It's a shame those boys couldn't be more copasetic
West L.A. fadeaway, West L.A. fadeaway
Big red light on the highway, little green light on the freeway
I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
I need a West L.A. girl, already know what I need to know
Lord, just how far to go
West L.A. fadeaway, here's one chance you say
She tries to live by the Golden Rule
Said you treat other people right
Other people probably treat you coolEmbed
