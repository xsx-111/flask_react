Green Rocky Road LyricsWell, it's a green rocky road, promenade in green
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
(love)
If you gotta carpet on your floor, you'll never get to Baltimore
Well, it's a green rocky road, promenade in green
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
Who-o you love
See the bird up in the sky
He don't run, he just fly
And it's a green rocky road, promenade in green
