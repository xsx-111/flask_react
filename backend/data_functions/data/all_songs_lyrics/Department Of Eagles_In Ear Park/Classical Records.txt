Classical Records LyricsDo you listen to your classical records any more?
Or do you let them sleep in their sleeves, where they be?
Do you suffer through those records that you turned around?
Or do you make them sleep in their sleeves where they weep?
Vinyl tears
I had a line but I don't remember
I had a time but I don't remember
I had a line but I don't remember
