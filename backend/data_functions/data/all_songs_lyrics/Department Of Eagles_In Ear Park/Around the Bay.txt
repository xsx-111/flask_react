Around the Bay LyricsYou're all too older today
All my words, they've flown away
I'll wait around for an hour or so
With those birds out in the bay
Making their rounds like I knew they would
All my thoughts left me again
Bliss me out, send me away
I'll wait around for an hour or so
Watch those birds out in the bay
Making their rounds like I knew they would
They'll be
Running all around
Running all around
Running all around
Grassy, still, late afternoon
Saw your face swimming in the blue
You lie around for an hour or two
Watch us kids play in our parks
Dropping our lies like a gospel tale
We'll be
Running all around
Running all aroundEmbed
