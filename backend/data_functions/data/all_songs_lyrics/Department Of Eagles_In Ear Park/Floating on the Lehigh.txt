Floating on the Lehigh LyricsIf I just left for a while
Dead dusk, a dive in the cold
Floating on the Lehigh
Floating off the river
Floating on to Bethlehem
Innocent pin up and bow
Whispers dragging me down
Brother, breathe easy now
Nothing's taking over you
The kids can all crowd around
The candles on the mantle wave kind regards
Regards, regards, regards
But I know for all we've done
I'd never have guessed we'd end things here
Floating on the Lehigh
Carry me to rest now
Floating on to Bethlehem
And in the night
We'll all lay down
And we'll let it go
Forever, and never allow for a second try
And my, what a quiet land
And oh, what a quiet man would try to break it
It happens to be my specialty
But why, why, oh why
Why do you insist on leaving this all to the end
I'll never knowEmbed
