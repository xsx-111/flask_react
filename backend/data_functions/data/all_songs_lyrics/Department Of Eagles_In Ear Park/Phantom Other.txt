Phantom Other LyricsAlright, we'll do this your way
Alright, we'll make it anyway
Now'd be a good time
To send us all away, man
So what would it take?
And what would it take
To make you learn?
And what would it take?
And what would it take
To make you listen?
Oh man, you're not the only one
Oh boy, with that phantom other on
Now'd be the right time
To send us all away
It'd be a good time
If you just go away, man
What would it take?
What would it take
To make you leave?
What would it take?
What would it take
To make you listen?
My God in Heaven
What were we thinking?
My God in Heaven
What were we thinking of?
Look out, look out now
We gotta get out now
Look out, look out now
We gotta get out now
Wake up, wake up now
We gotta get up now
Wake up, wake up now
We gotta get up now1Embed
