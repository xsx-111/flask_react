Teenagers LyricsSomething's bubbling up inside your holy head
You want to leave me but you don't know how to say it
Try to tell me other ways, didn't do any good
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Something's bubbling up inside my head
I want to stay here but I don't know how
Gone, you'll be gone, with all that we should be gone
In the morning, morning
Maybe we should back it together
But I don't know if it'd be much better, oh
Teenagers, teenagers, teenagers
Teenagers, teenagers, teenagers
Something's tumbling down inside your holy head
I know you're hiding when you drive by with your hood on
Gone, you'll be gone, with all that we should be done
In the morning, morning
(morning, morning)
Teenagers, teenagers, teenagers
Teenagers, teenagers, teenagers1Embed
