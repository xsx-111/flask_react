Waves of Rye LyricsGhastly protector
Save me from this waste
He's drifting asleep faster
Drowning in waves of rye
Spinnin' round the ballroom floor
Round and round the ballroom floor
Never seen but always sought after
After, after
Ghastly protector
Save me from this waste
He shakes me up like no other
Laughing in my face
He's mouthing off like a bastard
Drowning in those waves of rye
Spinnin' round the ballroom floor
Round and round the ballroom floor
Never seen but always sought after
After, after
Heaven is a ballroom
With high ceilings
Filled with white balloons
And smoke machinesEmbed
