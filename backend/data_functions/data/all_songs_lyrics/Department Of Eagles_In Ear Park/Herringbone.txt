Herringbone LyricsOh boy, when you're gone, you are gone
Those nights you wander all night
You won't get to relive them
Or even to explain them
To your next of kin
They come one
After the other, after the other
Just like herring bone
Oh, oh, oh oh
Way out there where the tide meets the tide
Those nights you'd get so quiet
You won't get to enjoy them
Or even to explain them
To your next of kin
They come one
After the other, after the other
Just like herring bone
Oh, oh, oh oh
And I know you like herring bone
Yeah, I know you like herring bone
Through the cold you've held on with
The one you went to went to war with
The only word you can't explainEmbed
