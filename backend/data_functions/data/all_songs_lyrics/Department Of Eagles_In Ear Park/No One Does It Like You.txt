No One Does It Like You Lyrics

Out in the morning calm
You don't need to 'ave an alibi
And in the morning calm
You don't need to be so honest

And in the morning calm
You don't need to 'ave an alibi
And in the morning calm
You don't need to breathe so easy

I laughed so hard I fell down
I curse these lanes I walked on

Ah-ah, oh-ah-ah-ooh-oh-ah-ah
No one does it like you
No one does it like you
I tried so hard
But no one does it like you
No one does it like you
But I tried so hard
I tried so hard
I tried so hard2Embed
