What Can Be Done LyricsThe walls are coming down all around me
The walls are coming down all around me
The walls are coming down
But I can't explain, it's not my fault
And God, what would we do without each other?
And God, what would we do without each other?
And God, what would we do, and what can be done?
It's not my fault
The walls are coming down all around me
The walls are coming down all around me
The walls are coming down but I can't explain
It's not my fault
What we're gonna doEmbed
