Sad Person Lyrics
You are, you are
A sad, sad person
Always been
A sad, sad person
It's not that bad
You just take sadness for a ride
And question everything you do
You are  never satisfied

Love is a disease
The strongest addiction I know
What happens in your brain
Is the same as a rush of cocaine
The more you have
The more you crave
Oh how I never managed
Such level of intensity yeah

I'm not gonna hurt you
Cause I'm flirting with you
I'm not gonna hurt myself
So what else? What else? What else?
What else?
What else?
I wanna know why I hesitate
To place myself above you
To please myself like a good, good, girl
To face myself in the mirror
You wanna know why I changed my mind
And when I did everything was fine
Sometimes the truth is right there, right there
If you're beautiful here, you're beautiful there

I am, I am
A sad, sad person
Always been
A sad, sad person

What can I do?
I'm not gonna hurt you
Cause I'm flirting with you
I'm not gonna hurt myself
So what else? What else? What else?
What else? What else?
I'm not gonna hurt you
I'm not gonna hurt myself
Cause I'm flirting with you
So what else? What else? What else?
Look at me in the eyes
Look at me and decide
All the truth is right here
Yeaaaah
I'm not gonna hurt you
Cause I'm flirting with you
I'm not gonna hurt myself
So what else? What else? What else?Embed
