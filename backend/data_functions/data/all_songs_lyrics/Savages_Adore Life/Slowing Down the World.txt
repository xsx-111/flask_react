Slowing Down the World Lyrics
I offer you someone
So you can do what you want
Only with true experience will the voice you speak be true
I offer you someone
To shape the world you like
Only with dark desires
Your nights will flame with fire

Is it for you I beg?
Is it for you I pray?
Is it for you I lay down anywhere?

Something to be said about slowing down
The world

Bathed in the light that gave you
Important shadow
You were furious and petrified
Envious of their glow
Your eyes were moist with
The love they lost
You were all dressed up
With no place to go
Is it for you I serve?
Is it for you I long?
Is it for you the hours on my own?

Something to be said about slowing down
The world

Is it for you I love?
Is it for you I hide?
Is it for you I leave someone behind?

You are horny all the time
And darling it's not a crime
Something to be said about slowing
Down the worldEmbed
