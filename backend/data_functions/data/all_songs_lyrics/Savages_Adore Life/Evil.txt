Evil Lyrics
They will try to make you stay
Steal the peace away from you
Soak your actions in self doubt
If you don't live the way they like
They'll make you feel jealousy
Only one way to raise a family
I squeeze your brain 'til you forget
Why is it you're so afraid?

Stay Catholic, stay pragmatic
Don't try to change the way your parents did it
Believe all the lies, don't look at the thighs
Or they'll poke out your eyes
Oh if you try

So don't try to change, don't try to change
The way they made you
Don't try to change, don't try to change
Or they will hurt you, they will break you down

They will try to reduce you
No matter, no matter what it takes
Just because I have you
It doesn't mean they'll give me their consent
So don't try to change
Don't try to change
The way they made you
And on't try to change
Don't try to change
What's inside you no
Don't try to change
Don't try to change
Or they will hurt you
They will hurt you and
And they will break you down

Evil's on the other side
I would never let you down
Evil's on the other side
I would never let you down
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evil
Evil, evil, evil, evilEmbed
