Surrender LyricsSurrender
Walk on water
Come and be my muse
I hope to get used
Horses of pleasure
Ride them to the ether
Never suffer
Surrender surrender
Surrender surrender
Headlines in the press
The bridges are endless
Weightlessness
Vertigo
Climax on the go
What we do
And what we show
Surrender surrender
Surrender surrender
You wanna
You know her
You tell her
You love her
You wanna
You know her
You tell her
You want her
You wanna
You know her
You tell her
You love her
You wanna
You know her
You tell her
Surrender
