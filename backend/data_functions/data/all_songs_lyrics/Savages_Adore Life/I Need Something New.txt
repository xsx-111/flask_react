I Need Something New LyricsI need something new in my ears
Something you could say perhaps
Or the words coming out of your mouth
Wouldn't be something I've heard before
I need something new
I need something new
I need something new
How do you get the excitement
From such an empty space?
I'm trying to meditate
I'm trying to recreate
The heartbeat
The adrenaline
I need something new
I need something new
I need something new
You, you say it's impossible
Trying to make things possible
I'm trying my best
To make it possible
Everyday yeah yeah
I'm kicking at the wall
Kicking at the wall
Yeah I'm kicking at the wall
I'm kicking the wall
Cause I need something new
I need something new
I need something new
I need something new
I do, I do, I do
You, you kept the door open
While on my hands and knees
The corridor was empty
And you were fucking me
I could feel the cold air
Coming inside the room
And I thought that was new
Yeah I thought that was something new
Oh I need you
I need you I need you
I need something new
I need you I need you
I need something new
I need you I need you
I need something new
I need you I need you
I need something new new
I need you I need something new
I need you I need you
I need something new
I need you I need you
I need something new
I need something new
I need something new
I need something new
And you do tooEmbed
