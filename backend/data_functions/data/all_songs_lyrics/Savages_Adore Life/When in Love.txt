When in Love LyricsIs it good
Is it bad
Things we do
When in love
Is it a demon
Or an angel
Holding us
When in love
Is it love
Or is it boredom
That took me up
To your bedroom
Is it love
Or something stupid
Was I feeling
All alone
When in love
When in love
When in love
Oh I hate your
Taste in music
You're not the one
I've been waiting for
Chase you around
The tables
I want your fingers
Down my throat
Fear of drowning
Die of longing
Head is swirling
Hands are cold
Find excuses
After excuses
To stay longer
Than I should
When in love
When in love
When in love
When in love
I think I'm in love
This is love
You say you want love, yeah?
But what kind of love?
And if I leave you now forever
Would it be really forever
Coz next time I'm in the neighborhood
I might be knocking at your door
I might be knocking at your door
I might be knocking at your door
Coz this love
This is not boredom
That took me up
To your bedroom
This is love
It's not a demon
That came knocking at your door
When in love
When in love
I think I'm in love
This is love
I'm in love
This is loveEmbed
