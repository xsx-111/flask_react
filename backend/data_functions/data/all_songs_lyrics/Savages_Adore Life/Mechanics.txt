Mechanics LyricsWhen I take a man
At my command
My love will stand
The test of time
When I take a man
Or a woman
They're both the same
They're both human
I want to learn
The touch of love
How you could burn
With just one touch
I want to know
The come and go
The mechanics
And know the tricks of love
The tricks of love
When I take a man
To sleep over
Pain and pleasure
Will touch my hand
And I will hold
What is untold
About my sex
And about porn
When I'm with you
I want to do
All the things that
I've never have done
When I take a man
At my command
My love will stand
The test of time
The test of timeEmbed
