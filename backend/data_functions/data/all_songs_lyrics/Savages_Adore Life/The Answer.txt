The Answer LyricsIf you don't love me
You don't love anybody
If you don't love me
You don't love anybody
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
There are things I know we should
Better not do but I know you could
Sleep with me
And we'd still be friends
Or I know
I'll go insane
Love is the answer
I'll go insane
Love is the answer
Wish me luck
This was a hard year
And I can't see
No brighter future
Wish me luck
I saw the answer
It was a girl
Will you go ask her
I saw the answer
Will you go ask her
Love is the answer
I'll go insane
I'll go insane
I'll go insane
I'll go insane
Please stand up
What is the point
To cry for life
To cry about love
To wait for her
To wait for dying
I can't wait
I saw the answer
Will you go ask her?
Love is the answer
Will you go ask her
If you don't love me
You don't love anybody
If you don't love me
You don't love anybody
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
Ain't you glad it's you?
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't love meEmbed
