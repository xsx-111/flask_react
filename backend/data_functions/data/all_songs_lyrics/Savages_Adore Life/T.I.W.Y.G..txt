T.I.W.Y.G. LyricsThis is what you get when you mess with love
This is what you get when you mess with love
A morning in darkness
The eyes of a storm
Suffering, straight from the gods
No medicine, no, no drugs
This is what you get when you mess with love
We gave you life to see if you'd disobey
Not interested in what we have to say
You mess with love when you go out tonight
Doesn't matter who's wrong or right
All you want is that feeling again
When someone is camping in your head
Look right, look left, what a distress
I saw a No become a Yes
This is what you get when you mess with love
I mess with love, I mess with love
I mess with love, you mess with love
Look for adventure
To be free, why not me?
Stay down, crawl down
Don't say you're innocent
Or you'll dry out like a raisin in the sun
Coz
This is what you get when you mess with love
I mess with love, I mess with love
I mess with love, you mess with love
I mess with love, you mess with loveEmbed
