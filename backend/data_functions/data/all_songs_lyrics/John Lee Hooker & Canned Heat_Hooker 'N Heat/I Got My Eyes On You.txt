I Got My Eyes On You LyricsI like to see you walk
I like to see you walk
I like to see you walk
You my baby
Keep my eyes on you
Well, keep on walking babe
Keep on walking
Well, keep on walking
Oh yes, and walk your walk
I like to see you walk
I like to see you walk
I like to see you walk
You my babe
Got my eyes on you
I love to see you switch
I love to see you switch
I love to see you switch
You my babe
I got my eyes on you
I see you every day
Walking down the street
I see you every day
Walking down the street
You my baby
Keep my eyes on you way
I got my eye on you
Any way you walk
I see you
Every move you make
I got my eye
I got my eye
I got my eye on you
I got my eye on youEmbed
