Boogie Chillen No. 2 LyricsWell, my Mama didn't allow me
Just to stay out all night long
Well, my Mama didn't allow me
Just to stay out all night long
I didn't care she didn't allow
I was boogin' anyhow
When I first came to town, people
I was boogin' down Hazel Street
I heard everybody talkin' about
Henry Swing Club
I drop in there that night
When I got there
I say, "Yes, people, ah-huh-ah"
They was really havin' a ball
Yes, I know
Then I hollered
"Boogie Chillen'"
Well, I feel good
Like I thought I would
You hear that cat
On the harmonica?
That's the Canned Heat
I know you'll dig it
I was layin' down one night
I heard Mama and Papa talkin'
I heard Papa tell Mama
"Let that boy boogie woogie
It's in him
And it got to come out"
I felt so good
I felt so good
I wanna do the boogaloo
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
All night
Then I heard Papa tell Mama
"Let the boy boogie boogaloo
It's in him
And it got to come out"
I felt so good
I went on boogin'
All night
Hey
I was layin' down one night
I heard Mama and Papa talkin'
I heard Papa tell Mama
"Let that boy boogie woogie
It's in him
It got to come out"
I felt so good
What I boogie woogie all, all night long
Hey, hey, hey
I feel good
I felt good
That I thought
Just like I thought
Like I thought I would
I, I, I
I high
I high
I felt good
Like I thought I would
Like I thought that I would now
Come on
Then I heard Papa tell Mama
"Let that boy boogie woogie
It in him
It got to come out"
And I felt good
When I heard her say
I felt good
When I heard her say
"Let him boogie"
"Let him boogie"
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
I wanna boogie
I feel good
I high
I high
I high
High, high
High, high
A little higher
A little higher
A little higher
I feel good
I feel good
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
Alright, Alan
You feel good
And you feel good
Like I thought that you would now
And you feel good
Hey, hey, heyEmbed
