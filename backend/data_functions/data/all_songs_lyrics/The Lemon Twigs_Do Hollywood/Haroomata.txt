Haroomata LyricsI knew a girl with marks of X
I knew someone I couldn't forget
Though it haunted me, it shook me
But I carried on just how I came if not for the pain
I found the source of all my pain
The emptiness inside my brain
Though it's hollow, we retain it
And just carry on the way we came
It's always the same
I understand why I fell back in myself
It's clear to meEmbed
