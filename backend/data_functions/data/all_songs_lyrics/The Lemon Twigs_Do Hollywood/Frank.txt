Frank LyricsWhere are your eyes in this lonesome hallway?
Why do they hide from me? I'll take the long way
Only a fool ends up tagged and buried
Dead in a pool of compromise, so empty
If I were a wise man I'd ignore the pile of tears
But I'm not, I'm afraid
Don't hurt me, I'm just a child
Spare me the games, I can do without them
"What are their names?", as you try to figure out them
When will you see that I am not lying?
And as I read I think, "am I even trying?"
If I stood before you and took joy in how we dance
I would play and would stay in suspicion just like a child
Where is my lover, the one who can see me
When did my light get distorted and greedy?
If I were a tyrant or destroyer of love
I would not destroy you, my darling
You're not aloneEmbed
