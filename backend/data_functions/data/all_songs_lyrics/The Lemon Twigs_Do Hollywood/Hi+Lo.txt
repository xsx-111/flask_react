Hi+Lo Lyrics
Not in the very same house as my own mom, girl
Not in the very same house as my own dad
Now I only wish I could go back, baby, uh oh

High and low for you, I'm lookin'
High and low for you
Good lookin' girl lookin' high and low for you
High and low for you
High and low for you
High and low for you

That occurrence was what they said felt nice
Made no difference, still I ain't no man
Only these recordings can do that, but hey
Still I ain't as good as him
Thought I was but guess the folks don't lie
And I'm allergic to them words, Ma
Somehow I'm allergic to them words
So listen to this song and tell me it ain't good, it ain't
And I will keep on knowin' that at best it is okay
And all that other stuff, well, it can wait
Started out about a girl
Now it's going back into that world

High and low for you, I'm lookin'
High and low for you
Good lookin' girl lookin' high and low for you
High and low for you
High and low for you
High and low for youEmbed
