A Great Snake LyricsWhen he looks right over here
I'm undone
I can't sit anymore
Telepathic drills
Turn in my mind when he looks me in the eye
Looks that really kill
He's all different kinds of people
Maybe
I'm a lonely mutant
Took off my helmet
Fell in love with you
Maybe
When he looks right over here
I see stars
My own legs start to fade
Maybe
I'm a vagrant hobo and I'm lookin' for Godot
Fell in love with you
Maybe
Is he even real?
Runs through my mind as he looks me in the eye
One more year until
Look, there's another sequel
Ba da da da dum, dum, dum
Ba da da da dum, dum, dum, dee dum
Ba da da da dum, dum, dum
Ba da da da dum, dum, dum, dee dum
Ba da da da da
Ba da da da dum, dum, dum
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
Ba da da da dum, dum, dum, dee dum
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
Maybe
I'm a lonely planet and I found the man it seems I'm destined for
Maybe
Maybe
I'm a lonely gay man and I found a space man, fell in love with you
Maybe

I'm not trying to take your sunshine
I'm not trying to steal you
I'm not trying to take your sunshine
I'm not trying to steal you
I'm not trying to take your sunshine
I'm not trying to steal you
I'm not trying to take your sunshine
I'm not trying to steal you
I'm not trying to take your sunshine
I'm not trying to steal you
I'm not trying to take your sunshine
I'm not trying to steal you
I'm not trying to take your sunshine
I'm not trying to steal you
I'm not trying to take your sunshine
I'm not trying to steal you
I'm not trying to take your sunshine
