Baby, Baby Lyrics
Was it just the best thing on my own?
Well I don't know
I'm no man
He don't think that this is right for me
Maybe not
Hey, I ain't caught

Baby, baby why ya so angry at me?
Baby, baby why ya so angry at me?
Done all I could do, now I'm feelin' blue, ooo
Come on girl, you know I'm not angry at you
Dadadun dadada
Dadun dadada
Dadun da, dadada, da
Dadadun dadada
Dadun dadada
Dadun da, da daaa

Not as good as me, her voice is strong
She isn't wrong
Better just to feel what's gone is gone
Hangin' on
Oh no, baby
Baby, baby why ya so angry at me?
Baby, baby why ya so angry at me?
Done all I could do, now I'm feelin' blue, oo-oo
Come on girl, you know I'm not angry at you
Waitin' on ya
Waitin' on you
Dadadun dadada
Dadun dadada
Dadun da, dadada, da
Dadadun dadada
Dadun dadada
Dadun da, da da da
Baby, baby why ya so angry at me?
Baby, baby why ya so angry at me?
Done all I could do, now I'm feelin' blue, ooo
Come on girl, you know I'm not angry at youEmbed
