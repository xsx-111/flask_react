I Wanna Prove to You Lyrics
I wanna prove to you
My love is extended
My love never ended
My passion befriended
Your (Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-ba, ba) heart
To be the same with you
Is love fully realised
When I look in your eyes
I'm not telling you lies

Baby, why won't you love me?
Sugar-girl, why won't you hug me?
I tried and I tried all my life, all my life
To get you to see
Baby, I guess you're just not the one for me

I want to be with you
When my strength is tested
When I'm not invested
I haven't digested
What I said when all my sweetness went away
And I could taste the darkness
All of my life waiting for someone
Finding their waves
Pulsate and drum up
Love in an ocean
Love and devotion
Baby, why won't you love me?
Sugar-girl, why won't you hug me?
I tried and I tried all my life, all my life
To get you to be with me
Baby, I guess you're just not the one for me

I wanna prove to you (Why won't you love me?)
I wanna prove to you (Why won't you love me?)
I wanna prove to you what I can do
Prove to you what I can do
Yeah, yeah6Embed
