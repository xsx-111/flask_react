These Words Lyrics
Why do I have to follow you
To know just who I am?
I have enough previous worlds
To know which one I'm in

These words, these words
Mean nothing to my soul
These words, these words
Serve only to fill up a hole

Why can't I flow softly downstream
Without the violent surf
If I knew who I was talking about
Perhaps I'd know my worth

These words, these words
Mean nothing to my soul
These words, these words
Serve only to fill up a hole

These words, these words
Mean nothing to my soul
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
These words, these words
Serve only to fill up a hole1Embed
