Trench Town Lyrics
(Scoop, scoop, scoop, scoo-doo
Scoop, scoop wa-doo.)
Up a cane river to wash my dread
Upon a rock I rest my head
There I vision through the seas of oppression, oh-oo-wo!
Don't make my life a prison
 
We come from Trench Town, Trench Town (Trench town)
Most of them come from Trench Town
We free the people with music (sweet music)
Can we free the people with music (sweet music)?
Can we free our people with music? - With music
With music, oh music
Oh-y, my head
In desolate places we'll find our bread
And everyone see what's taking place, oh-oo-wo!
Another page in history

They say it's hard to speak
They feel so strong to say we are weak
But through the eyes the love of our people, oh-oo-wo!
They've got to repay
We come from (Trench town) Trench Town
We come from (Trench town) Trench Town
Trench - Trench Town (Trench town)
They say, "Can anything good come out of Trench Town?
(Trench - Trench town)
That's what they say, (Trench town); (Trench - Trench town)
Say (Trench - Trench town) we're the underprivileged people
So (Trench town) they keep us in chains
"Pay (Trench - Trench town) - pay - pay tribute to -" (Trench town)
We come from (Trench - Trench town)
We come from (Trench - Trench town)
Just because we come from Trench Town
Not because we come from Trench Town
Just because we come from (Trench town) 2Embed
