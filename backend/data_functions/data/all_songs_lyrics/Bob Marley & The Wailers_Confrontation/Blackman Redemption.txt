Blackman Redemption Lyrics
Woy-a, Natty Congo
A Dreadlock Congo I!
Woy-a, Natty Congo
A Blackman Redemption! Woy-yo, yo-oo-wo-oo!
A Blackman Redemption! Woy-yo, wo-oo-wo-oo!

No need, no need to get jumpy
No need and-a no need to get bumpy
And a no need and a no need to get bumpy
No nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-nee-need to get jumpy!

Youth and youth agree to
Cool running; can you dig it?
Cool running; yeah, one more time! I beg you
Cool running; can you stop it?
Cool running
Spread out, spread out
Spread out, spread out
Tell you about the Blackman Redemption; can you dig it? (Oh, yeah!)
A Blackman Redemption; can you stop it?
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Coming from the root of King David
Through to the line of Solomon
His Imperial Majesty is the Power of Authority
Spread out, spread out
Spread out, spread out
Spread out, spread out
Spread, spread out




It's just-a Blackman Redemption
Can you dig it (wo-yeah!) Good, Lord! Good, Lord! Good, Lord!
Blackman Redemption, can you stop it? Oh, no! Oh, no!
