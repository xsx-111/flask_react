Jump Nyabinghi Lyrics
(Hallelu-Jah!)
(Hallelu-Jah!)

Love to see when you move in the rhythm
I love to see, when you're dancing from within!
It gives great joy to feel such sweet togetherness
Everyone doing and they're doing their best
Huh, it remind I of the days in Jericho
When we trodding down Jericho walls
These are the days when we'll trod through Babylon, (na-na, na-na)
Got to trod until Babylon falls

Sing your song yah!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!
(Jump, jump, jump,) Nyabinghi!

We've got the herb (got it!)
We've got the herb (got it!)
We've got the herb (got it!)
So hand I the surf board
Because most of all we have not got nothing to lose. We-e-e-ey!

Love to see when you groove with the ridding
Because I love to see when you're dancing from within!
It gives great joy to see such sweet togetherness
Because everyone's doing and they're doing their best
Because it remind me of the days in Jericho
When we trodding down Jericho walls!
These are the days when we'll trod through Babylon
We keep on trodding until Babylon falls!
