Stiff Necked Fools Lyrics
Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity
Yes, you have gone for so long
With your love for vanity now
Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain imagination
So take Jah Sun, and Jah Moon
And Jah Rain, and Jah Stars
And forever, yes, erase your fantasy, yea-yeah!

The lips of the righteous teach many
But fools die for want of wisdom
The rich man's wealth is in his city
The righteous' wealth is in his Holy Place
So take Jah Sun, and Jah Moon
And Jah Rain, and Jah Stars
And forever, yes, erase your fantasy, yeah!
Destruction of the poor is in their poverty
Destruction of the soul is vanity, yeah!

So stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity, yea-ea-yeah!
Yes, you have gone - gone for so long
With your love for vanity now
But I don't want to rule you!
I don't want to fool you!
I don't want to school you
Things you - you might never know about!
Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain - vain imagination
Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for, o-ooh, simplicity 1Embed
