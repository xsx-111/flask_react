The Clouds Are Full of Wine  Lyrics
The clouds are full of wine
Not whiskey or rye
And the sky is full of bluebrains
Bluejays, mermaids
Bluejays, bluebirds
Bluejays, mermaids
Bluejays, bluebirds, rainbows

And the night is full of rhinestones
Pinecones, telephones
'n the sky is full of rhinestones
Pinecones, telephones
Wolfhowls, milkcows
Shadows to some hows

And the clouds are full of wine
Not whiskey or rye
'n the sky is full of bluebrains
Baboons, rhinos
Fools 'n baffoons

And my eyes are full of bloodbones
Snowcones, serenaders
'n sennnoritas
'n so on, so on
Melodies that go on, go on
Go on, go on
Go off, go off
Go off, go off, go off, go off
