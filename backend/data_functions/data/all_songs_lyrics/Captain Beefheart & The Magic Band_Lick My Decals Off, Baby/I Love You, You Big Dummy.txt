I Love You, You Big Dummy Lyrics
I love you, you big dummy, ha ha ha
I love you, you big dummy
Nobody has love

Breathe life, I don't breathe a lie

Breathe deep, don't breathe a lie
Love has nobody, nobody has love

I love you, you big dummy
I love you, you big, big dummy
I love you, you big dummy

Nobody has love, love has nobody
Breathe deep, breathe high
