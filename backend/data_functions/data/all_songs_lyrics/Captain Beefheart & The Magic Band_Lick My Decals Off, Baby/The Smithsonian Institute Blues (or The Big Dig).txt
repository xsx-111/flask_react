The Smithsonian Institute Blues (or The Big Dig) Lyrics
Come on down to the big dig
Come on down to the big dig
Come on to the big dig
Singin' the Smithsonian Institute Blues
Singin' the Smithsonian Institute Blues

The way it's goin' La Brea tar pits
I know you just can't lose
The new dinosaur is walkin' in the
Old one's shoes

Come on down to the big dig
Can't get around the big dig
This may be premature but if I'm wrong
You can just say it's the first time I was happy to be confused
Singin' the Smithsonian Institute Blues

All you new dinosaurs
Now it's up to you to choose
Before your feet hit the tar
You'd better kick off them old shoes
And forget about that big dig
Now you see it and it's up to you to choose
It sure looks funny for a new dinosaur
To be in an old dinosaur's shoes
Dina Shore's shoes, dinosaur shoes
C'mon down to the big dig
You can't get around the big dig
C'mon to the big dig
Ya can't get around the big dig
Singin' the Smithsonian Institute BluesEmbed
