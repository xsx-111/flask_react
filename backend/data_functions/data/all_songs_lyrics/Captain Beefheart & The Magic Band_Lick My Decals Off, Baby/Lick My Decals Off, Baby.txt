Lick My Decals Off, Baby Lyrics
Rather than I want to hold your hand
I wanna swallow you whole
And I wanna lick you everywhere it's pink
And everywhere you think
Rather than I want to hold your hand
I wanna swallow you whole
And I wanna lick you everywhere it's pink
And everywhere you think
Whole-kit-kaboodle in the kitchen sink
Whole-kit-kaboodle in the kitchen sink

Heaven's sexy as hell, life is integrated
Goes together so well, and so on
Well, I'm gon' go on and do my washing

Well, now you may think I'm crazy
But I want you to lick my decals off, baby
And I don't want you to be lazy
Cause it's drivin' me crazy

And this song ain't no sing-song
It's all about the birds 'n the bees 'n where it went all wrong
'n where it all belongs
'n the earth all goes down on their knees lookin' for a little ease
She stuck out her tongue and the fun begun
She stuck out her tongue and the fun begun
She stuck it out at me, and I just thumbed my nose
And went on washing my clothesEmbed
