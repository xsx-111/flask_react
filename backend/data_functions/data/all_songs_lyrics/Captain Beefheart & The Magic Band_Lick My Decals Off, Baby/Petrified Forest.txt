Petrified Forest Lyrics
Human Bark and beauty-less hide from beauty
Bow your eyes 'n heads to the duty of the dead's
Suck the ground
Breathe life into the dead dinosaurs
Let the past demons rear up their heads
'n belch fire in the air of now
The rug's wearing out that we walk on
Soon it will fray 'n we'll drop dead into yesterday
Must the breathing pay for those
Who breathe in 'n don't breathe out?
There'd be no gain, brother, if no one would play
As for your games count me in all that can see
Breathe in 'n out hungry today and eat hearty tomorrow
Or eat away 'n be eaten some day
No flower shall grow where oil shall flow
No seed shall sow in salt water
If the dinosaur cries with blood in his eyes
'n eats our babies for our lies
Belches fire in our skies
Maybe I'll die but he'll be rumbling through
Your petrified forestEmbed
