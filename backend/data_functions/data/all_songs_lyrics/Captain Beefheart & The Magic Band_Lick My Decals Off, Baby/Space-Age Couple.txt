Space-Age Couple Lyrics
Space-age couple
Why don't you flex your magic muscle?
Space-age couple
Why do you hex your magic muscle?
Space-age couple
Why do you hustle 'n bustle?
Why don't you drop your cool tom-foolery
And shed your nasty jewelry?
Why don't you drop your cool tom-foolery
And shed your nasty jewelry?
Why don't you drop your cool tom-foolery
And shed your nasty jewelry?
Why don't you drop your cool tom-foolery
And shed your nasty jewelry?
Why don't you drop your cool tom-foolery
And shed your nasty jewelry?
Why don't ya cultivate the grounds?
They're the only ones around
Why don't ya cultivate the grounds?
They're the only ones around
Why don't ya cultivate the grounds?
They're the only ones around
Why don't ya cultivate the grounds?
They're the only ones around
Space-age couple
Why don't you flex your magic muscle?
Hold a drinking glass up to your eye after you've
Scooped up a little of the sky
And it ain't blue no more
What's on the leaves ain't dew no more
What's on the leaves ain't dew no more
What's on the leaves ain't dew no more

Space-age couple
Why don't you just do that?
Space-age couple
Why don't you just do that?

Hold a drinking glass up to your eye after you've
Scooped up a little of the sky
And it ain't blue no more
What's on the leaves ain't dew no more
Space-age couple
Why don't you flex your magic muscle?
Space-age couple
Why do you hustle 'n bustle?
Space-age couple
Why don't you drop your cool tom-foolery
Shed your nasty jewelry
Space-age couple
Why don't you just do that?
Space-age couple
Why don't you just do that?
Space-age couple
Why don't you just do that?
Space-age couple
Why don't you just do that?Embed
