The Buggy Boogie Woogie Lyrics
Oh that buggy boogie woogie
Sweeps me off my feet
What this world needs
Is a good retreat

What this world needs is a good two dollar room
And a good two dollar broom
What this world needs is a good two dollar room
And a good two dollar broom

One day I was sweepin' down by the wall
I bumped a mama spider 'n the babies begin' to fall
Off o' my broom
Now I gotta keep on sweepin' 'n sweepin'
'fore they fill the room
Now that buggy boogie woogie sweeps me off my feet
I gotta keep on sweepin' 'n sweepin'
Seems like I could keep on sweepin' 'n sweepin'
'n there's still too many feet

What this world needs is a good two dollar room
'n a good two dollar broom
What this world needs is a good two dollar room
'n a good two dollar broom
Seems like I could keep on sweepin' 'n sweepin'
'n there's still too many feet
Well the way I must be sweepin'
Must be with too many feet
Ah, 'n I'll still keep on sweeping 'n sweepin'
'n there's still too many feetEmbed
