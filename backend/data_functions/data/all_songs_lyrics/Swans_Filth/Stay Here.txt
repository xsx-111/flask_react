Stay Here Lyrics
Be strong
Be hard
Resist temptation
Stick your hand in your eye
Close your fist
Resist
Walk on this line
Look straight ahead

Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles
Be hard
Be strong
Be hard
Be hard
Hard
Hard

And come back for more
Ah, come back
Ah, come back
Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles
Ah, come back
Be hard
Be hard
Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles
Come back
Come back
Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles
Be hard
Be hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Hard
Be hard
Be hard
Be hard
Be hard
Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles
Flex your muscles6Embed
