Power for Power Lyrics
Use sex for control
Use power for power
Use hate for freedom
Use money for cruelty
Use money for cruelty

Take control and keep it
Take control and keep it
Don't let go
Don't let go

He was your friend
She was your friend
He was your friend
She was your friend
They were wrong, they were wrong
They were wrong, they were wrong
Turn against them
Turn against them
Sex, power
Money, hate

Take control and keep it
Take control and keep it
Don't let go
Don't let go
Power for power
Power for power
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power's sake
Power for power
Power for power
Power for power
Power for power's sake5Embed
