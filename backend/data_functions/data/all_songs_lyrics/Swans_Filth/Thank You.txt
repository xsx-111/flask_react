Thank You Lyrics
Talk to me
Tell me the truth
This smells sour
Burn my face
I'm a cold fish
Feed on me

This smells sour
This smells sour
This smells sour
This smells sour

Burn me now
Burn me now
Feed my thing
Be my thing
Burn my face

This smells sour
This smells sour
This smells sour
This smells sour
Burn me now
Burn me now
Burn me now
Burn me now
Burn me now
Burn me now
Burn me now
Burn me now
Burn me nowEmbed
