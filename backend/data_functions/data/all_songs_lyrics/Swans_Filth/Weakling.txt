Weakling Lyrics
I don't feel pain
I never escape
I'm under the bed
I'm licking the floor

I never dream
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
Not real

You know everything
I forget how to breathe
You're touching my chest
When I'm touched, I bleed

I never dream
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
This isn't real
Not real
Not real
Not real
Not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
Not real, not real
