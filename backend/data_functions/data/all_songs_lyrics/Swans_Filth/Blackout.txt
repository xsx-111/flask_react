Blackout Lyrics
Get drunk, get drunk
Breathe in, breathe in
Hold it in, hold it in

Don't breathe, don't breathe
Blackout, blackout
Blackout, blackout

Don't talk
Until you're spoken to
Don't talk
Until you're spoken to

Don't breathe, don't breathe
Blackout, blackout
Blackout, blackout
Blackout, blackout
Blackout, blackout
Blackout, blackoutEmbed
