Freak Lyrics
Come here you freak
I saw you crawling last night
Big erection in your hand
You rule the world
You're gonna murder somebody weak
You're gonna murder somebody weak
Strong men win at violence and abuse
Strong men win at violence and abuse
Strong men win at violence and abuse

I'm not scared
I'll take what I want
Something for nothing
I want what you've got
I want what you've got1Embed
