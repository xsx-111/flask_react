Words Unspoken Lyrics
Why sing a lonely song?
The whole world knows that love goes wrong
Why bruise a heart that isn't broken?
It isn't broken, it can be broken

Life's just a show for free
Come along and watch with me
The only sins are words unspoken
Words unspoken, never spoken

Sweet things come and go
Give me shame, I'll give you woe
To live for love isn't so easy
It isn't easy, it won't be easy

How all good men try
Look around and wonder why
Can they shape this world to please me?
Can they please me, should they please me?

And follow, and maybe you'll correct me
I wish you'd never met me
For I am no gentle man
Follow and while you watch and wonder
I pull the world asunder
And show you who I am
Send me a gentle dream
Of love so strange it's never seen
And prove how such a love can happen
It can happen, make it happen

Fine things don't abound
Fade away without a sound
But hope must never end or slacken
Never slacken, never slacken

And follow and maybe you'll correct me
I wish you'd never met me
I am no gentle man
Follow and while you watch and wonder
I'll pull the world asunder
And show you who I amEmbed
