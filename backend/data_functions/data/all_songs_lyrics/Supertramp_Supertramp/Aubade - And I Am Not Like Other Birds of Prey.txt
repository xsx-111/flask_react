Aubade / And I Am Not Like Other Birds of Prey LyricsI) Aubade
(instrumental)
Ii) And I Am Not Like Other Birds of Prey
Morning at last
Every night is a fight 'til your waking
Dreams dancing past
Through the silence of sleep dawn is breaking
I wait and watch until day
And I am not like other birds of prey
And I am not like other birds of prey
When night is long, you are needing me
For (at rest or talk?) I am there to see
That fear holds no sway
Soft is my flight
And my eyes kill the lies that attack you
Life is my right
And in sleep's little bed I'll protect you
So hear, lest my presence dismay
That I am not like other birds of prey
That I am not like other birds of prey
When hopes are young and your cares are few
Then I soar above keeping truth in you
And my name is loveEmbed
