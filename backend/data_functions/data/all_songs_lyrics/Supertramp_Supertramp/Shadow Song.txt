Shadow Song LyricsDid your shadow ever speak to you?
And did he say that something's wrong?
Only a figure on a lamplit wall
Never realised he cared at all
Did he stop you going on?
Yes my shadow spoke to me tonight
And made me throw my dreams away
Told a story of a twisted man
Who was playing with some foolish plan
About a girl who'd have her way
Sometimes shadows are near
I see things very clear
My life unwinds
Somewhere I'll make my stand
Look round at yesterday
And change my mind
Now your shadow isn't always there
In the light of a cloudy day
Or in circles where you hide from view
All the doubts that ever bothered you
And where people lose your nameEmbed
