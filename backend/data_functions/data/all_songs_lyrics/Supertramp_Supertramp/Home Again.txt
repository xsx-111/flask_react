Home Again LyricsMany's the time that a dream has gone wrong when you're with me
Many's the time when the blame went to you â€“ please forgive me
But the truth is my friend that the world isn't quite as I thought it to be
Oh no, I wish I were back home again
Oh no, I wish I were back home again
Oh no, I wish I were back home again
Oh no, I wish I were back home againEmbed
