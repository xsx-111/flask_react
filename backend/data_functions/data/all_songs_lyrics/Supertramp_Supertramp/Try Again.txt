Try Again LyricsLater that evening, only a feeling
But it was there in the air that we share in the twilight
Humming a sad song, where was our day gone
But in the dark was a spark, a remark I remember
"Try again", she replied to some story I told
"Try again", yes I will if I can
Oh, all I need is somebody to hold
Learning a feeling, seeking a meaning
Finding a way, should she stay, how to say let's imagine
Maybe I'll go wrong, and it may not last long
But in the night all the light must be right for this moment
"Try again", she replied to some story I told
"Try again", yes I will if I can
Oh, all I need is somebody to hold
"Try again", she replied to some story I told
"Try again", yes I will if I can
Oh, all I need is somebody to hold
"Try again", she replied to some story I told
"Try again", yes I will if I can
Oh, all I need is somebody to hold1Embed
