Surely (reprise) LyricsSurely there's a way I could please you
Only in your past lie the tears
Surely there's a day you can say went your way
Some illusion you can keep through the years
Only if I lied could I love you
Nothing of our lives could we share
Only could we try to get by on a sigh
Just because, just this once, I was thereEmbed
