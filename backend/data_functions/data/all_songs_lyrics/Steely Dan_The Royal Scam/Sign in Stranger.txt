Sign in Stranger Lyrics
Have you heard about the boom on Mizar 5?
People got to shout to stay alive
They don't even have policeman a-one
Doesn't matter where you been or what you've done
Do you have a dark spot on your past
Leave it to my man he'll fix it fast
Pepe has a scar from ear to ear
He will make your mug shots disappear

You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won't you sign in stranger
Do you like to take a yo-yo for a ride
Zombie I can see you're qualified
Walk around collecting Turkish union dues
They will call you sir and shine your shoes
Or maybe you would like to see the show
You'll enjoy the cafe d'escargot
Folks are in a line around the block
Just to see her do the can-can-jacques
You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won't you sign in stranger
Love or leave her, yellow fever
Sure, it's all in the game
And who are you
Just another scurvy brother

You zombie
Be born again my friend
Won't you sign in stranger
