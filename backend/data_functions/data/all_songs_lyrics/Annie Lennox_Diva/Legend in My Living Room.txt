Legend in My Living Room LyricsWhen I was just seventeen
I ran away from home
To be with all the pretty people
To be on my own, yeah
Bright lights and trains and bedsit stains
And pavements paved with gold
And I believed in everything
That everybody told me...
Have mercy
Have mercy on me
I found myself in a lonely place
With a suitcase full of dreams
And I soon grew up to realize
What living in the doghouse means, ooh
But everyday I told myself
Good things would happen soon
'Cause I knew that I was going to be
A legend in my living room, yeah
Have mercy (common on sister, sing)
Have mercy on me
Have mercy (common on brother, sing)
Have mercy on me
Have mercy (common on mother, sing)
Have mercy on me
Have mercy (common on father, sing)
Have mercy on me
(Welcome to this perfect world)
Now everyday, on a dead-end street
Is where I spend my time
The dust has been collecting
On the corners of my mind
But I shed my tears in bitter drops
Until the thorn trees bloomed
To take the spiky fruit
To crown myself the queen of doom, yeah
Have mercy (common people sing)
Have mercy on me (mercy on the children)
Have mercy (common people sing)
Have mercy on me (I need to hear you sing)
Have mercy (oh they got it girls)
Have mercy on me
Have mercy (sing it for yourself)
Have mercy on meEmbed
