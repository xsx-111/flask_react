Step by Step LyricsStep by step
Bit by bit
Stone by stone yeah
Brick by brick
Step by step
Day by day
Mile by mile oooh
Now don't you slip away
Don't you go too far
'Cause when I close my eyes
I know who you are
You are the dark emotion
That makes me hold my breath
Just like the silent water
Upon the ocean's depth
Don't you slip away
Don't you go too far
'Cause when I close my eyes
I know who you are
It's just the fear of falling
That makes my lose my grip
It's just the fear of falling
That makes my fingers slip
Step by step
Bit by bit
Stone by stone yeah
Brick by brick
Step by step
Day by day
Mile by mile oooh
Go your way
Baby don't give up
You've gotta hold on to what you've got
I said baby don't give up
You've gotta keep on moving, don't stop, yeah
Just like a new excursion (I know you're hurting)
Upon an open road (I know you do)
I've got the will to take me (I know you're hurting)
Just where I want to go (don't let the bad thing get to you)
C'mon baby keep moving on
C'mon baby keep on
Keep up...Embed
