Keep Young and Beautiful LyricsWhat's cute about a little cutie
It's her beauty, not brains
Old father time will never harm you
If your charm still remains
After you grow old baby
You don't have to be a cold baby
Keep Young and Beautiful
It's your duty to be beautiful
Keep young and beautiful
If you want to be loved
Don't fail to do your stuff
With a little powder and a puff
Keep young and beautiful
If you want to be loved
If you're wise exercise all the fat off
Take it off, off of here, off of there
When you're seen anywhere with your hat off
Wear a Marcel wave in your hair
Take care of all those charms
And you'll always be in someone's arms
Keep young and beautiful
If you want to be loved
If you're wise, exercise all the fat off
Take it off, off of here, off of there
When you're seen anywhere with your hat off
Wear a Marcel wave in your hair
Hahaha
Keep young and beautiful
It's your duty to be beautiful
That's right
Keep young and beautiful
If you want to be loved
Keep young and beautiful
If you want to be loved
