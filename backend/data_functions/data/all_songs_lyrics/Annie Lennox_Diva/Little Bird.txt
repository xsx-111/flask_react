Little Bird Lyrics
I look up to the little bird
That glides across the sky
He sings the clearest melody
It makes me want to cry
It makes me want to sit right down and cry, cry, cry, yeah

I walk along the city streets
So dark with rage and fear
And I, I wish that I could be that bird
And fly away from here
I wish I had the wings to fly away from here, yeah

But my, my I feel so low
My, my, where do I go?
My, my, what do I know?
My, my, we reap what we sow
They always said that you knew best but
This little bird's fallen out of that nest now
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed so
I've just got to put these wings to test

Woo Ooh Hoo
Awww hawww
Woo Ooh Hoo
Awww hawww
For I am just a troubled soul
Who's weighted
(Weighted!)
Weighted to the ground
(Weighted to the ground, yeah weighted to the ground)
Give me the strength to carry on
Till I can lay my burden down
(Lay the burden down, yeah lay the burden down)
Give me the strength to lay this burden down, down, down, yeah
Give me the strength to lay it down
(Lay down, lay it down)

But my, my I feel so low
My, my, where do I go?
My, my, what do I know?
My, my, we reap what we sow
They always said that you knew best but
This little bird's fallen out of that nest now
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed so
I've just got to put these wings to test

Woo Ooh Hoo
But my, my I feel so low
My, my, where do I go?
My, my, what do I know?
My, my, we reap what we sow
They always said that you knew best but
This little bird's fallen out of that nest now
I've got a feeling that it might have been blessed so
I've just got to put these wings to test

I feel so low
My, my, where do I go?
My, my, what do I know?
My, my, we reap what we sowEmbed
