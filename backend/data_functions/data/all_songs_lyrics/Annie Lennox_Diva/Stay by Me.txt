Stay by Me LyricsStay by me and make the moment last
Please take these lips even if I have been kissed
A million times
And I don't care if there is no tomorrow
I could die here in your arms
Even if the stars have made us blind
We're blind… we're blind
So blind in love
Do ba do ba do down down
Ba do ba do down down
Ba do ba do down down
Do ba do ba do down down
Ba do ba do down down
Ba do ba do down down
So blind in love…
Come on now Baby, Come on now Baby
Come on now Baby, Come on now Baby...
Come on now Baby…
Come on now Baby…
Come on now Baby

Sweet darling,  don't you know
That we're no different to anyone
We stumble, we falter
But we're no different than anyone
Though the winter snow has melted down
Into a pool of silver water
We were standing in a thunder cloud
Dark as your hair… dark as your hair
Do ba do ba do down down
Ba do ba do down down
Ba do ba do down down
Do ba do ba do down down
Ba do ba do down down
Ba do ba do down down
So blind in love… Mm mm mm mm mm mm…
Oo oo oo oo, yeah!
So blind in love…
Come on now Baby, Come on now Baby
Come on now Baby, Come on now Baby...
Come on now Baby…
Come on now Baby…
Come on now BabyEmbed
