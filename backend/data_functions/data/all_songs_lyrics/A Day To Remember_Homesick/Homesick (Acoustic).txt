Homesick (Acoustic) Lyrics
Everything around me seems so much different than where I'm from
And at this rate I think my fate's been sealed
This life's so unpredictable
We'll go
Continue to live a life that no one knows
Where's this gonna go?
Right here, right now
This is the beginning of the end

And I won't sing a single thing until we can get this right
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose
We made our moves
And now we got to go
Go

Everything about me seemed so much different when I was young
I couldn't wait to take my place
Five years have passed
Good God have I been gone?
So why?
I've never felt so alone in my whole life
Signs aren't on my side
Right here, right now
This is the beginning of the end
And I won't sing a single thing until we can get this right
I'm moving on
I'm moving on

Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose
We made our moves
And now we got to go
And why's this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?
And why's this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?

I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward but we're not there yet
I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward

I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward but we're not there yet
I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward
Hey mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell dad I'm just fine
We had to choose
We made our moves
And now we got to go
And why's this make me so nervous?
(You make me so, you make me so)
Why does everything go wrong?
And why does this make me so nervous?
(You make me so, you make me so)
Why does everything go wrong?Embed
