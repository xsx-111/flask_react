Homesick Lyrics
Everything around me seems so much
Different than where I'm from
And at this rate I think my fate's been sealed
This life's so unpredictable
We'll go
Continue to live a life that
No one knows
Where's this gonna go?

Right here, right now, this is
The beginning of the end (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
And I won't sing one single thing until we can get this right
I'm moving on, I'm moving on

Hey Mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell Dad I'm just fine
We had to choose, we made our moves
And now, we got to go, go

Everything about me seemed so much
Different when I was young
I couldn't wait to take my place
Five years have passed, good God, have I been gone?
So, why?
I've never felt so alone in
My whole life
Time's not on my side
Right here, right now
This is the beginning of the end (Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!)
And I won't sing one single thing until we can get this right
I'm moving on, I'm moving on

Hey Mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell Dad I'm just fine
We had to choose, we made our moves
And now, we got to go

And why's this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?
Why's this make me so nervous?
Why does everything go wrong?

I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward, but we're not there yet
I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward

I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward, but we're not there yet
I'm holding on to a fairy tale
We're moving forward, we're moving forward

Hey Mom, I wrote you some soft songs
And tell Dad I'm just fine
We had to choose, we made our moves
And now, we got to go

And why's this make me so nervous? (You make me so)
(You make me so) Why does everything go wrong?
Why's this make me so nervous? (You make me so)
(You make me so) Why does everything go wrong?4Embed
