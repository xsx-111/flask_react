If It Means a Lot to You Lyrics
And hey, darling
I hope you're good tonight
And I know you don't feel right when I'm leaving
Yeah, I want it, but no, I don't need it
Tell me something sweet to get me by
'Cause I can't come back home 'til they're singing

La, la la la, la la la, 'til everyone is singing

If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear to you that we can make this last, la, la
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear, come tomorrow, this will all be in our past

Well, it might be for the best
And hey, sweetie
Well, I need you here tonight
And I know that you don't want to be leaving me
Yeah, you want it, but I can't help it
I just feel complete when you're by my side
But I know you can't come home 'til they're singing
La, la la la, la la la, 'til everyone is singing
La, la la la, la la la

If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear to you that we can make this last, la, la
If you can wait 'til I get home
Then I swear, come tomorrow, this will all be in our past

Well, it might be for the best

You know you can't give me what I need
And even though you mean so much to me
I can't wait through everything
Is this really happening?
I swear, I'll never be happy again
And don't you dare say we can just be friends
I'm not some boy that you can sway
We knew it'd happen eventually

La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(If you can wait 'til I get home)
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(Then I swear we can make this last)
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(If you can wait 'til I get home)
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing
(Then I swear we can make this last)
La, la la la, la la la, now everybody's singing, la...42Embed
