My Life for Hire Lyrics
Somebody give me a sign
That everything's going as planned
And then everything falls away
Into the darkness of this shallow place
The detail is striking, the room's cold and frightening
You'll kick and you'll scream, you'll try everything to survive
But you should know your fate by now

They told me how I should be
But I broke the mold somehow!

It's too late, too late
You keep trying to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done to me

You, you know you gotta assert yourself
Leave what you need for now
It's not the time or place you're searching for
All I can give them's my worst of intentions
You're nothing to me and everyone can see that your life's a lie
There's nowhere left to hide
They told me how I should be
But I broke the mold somehow

It's too late, too late
You keep trying to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done to me
It's too late, too late
You keep trying to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done to me

Watch your back, you'll lose yourself
This is a battleground!
When will they know?
Your life's a lie

It's too late, too late
You keep trying to resolve the past right now
But I swear I'll be the one
To let the world know what you've done
(Somebody give me a sign)
It's too late, too late
(That everything's going as planned)
You keep trying to resolve the past right now
(And then everything falls away)
But I swear I'll be the one
(Into the darkness of this shallow place)
To let the world know what you've done
They told me, they told me how I should be
But I broke the mold somehow!6Embed
