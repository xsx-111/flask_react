Welcome to the Family Lyrics
We're finally alone at last
Oh, how I've waited for this day to come
There's just something about you that rubs me wrong
You're not worth my attention
I built this with
My own two hands
If you could spare me the time
Stop using me as your next misconception

I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever
It haunts me
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever
It haunts me

It won't be long before you meet your end
You're nothing more than a passing trend
So, keep those cameras
Rolling!
You think I wouldn't remember?
You thought that I would lose faith in myself
You can spare me the lies, you don't believe in me
Your life's a contradiction
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever
It haunts me
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever
It haunts me

We draw the line at
Being in your life
Here's to the man of the hour, we'll cast out problems aside
Cheers to your future, may they bury you alive!


Move!

I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever
It haunts me
I don't believe that everything
You've known about me is gone forever
And I won't forget the days that we spent forever
It haunts me
