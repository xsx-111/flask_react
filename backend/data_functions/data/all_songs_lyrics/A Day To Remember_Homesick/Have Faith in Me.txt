Have Faith in Me Lyrics
Have faith in me
'Cause there are things that I've seen I don't believe
So, cling to what you know and never let go
You should know things aren't always what they seem

I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall, and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance, then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again

I'm going crazy
'Cause there are things in the streets I don't believe
So, we'll pretend it's alright (Pretend it's alright)
And stay in for the night
Oh, what a world, I'll keep you safe here with me (With me)

I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall, and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance, then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall, and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance, then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again
They've got me on the outside looking in
But I can't see at all
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
They just wanna see me fall
They've got me on the outside looking in
But I can't see at all
With the weight of the world on my shoulders
They just wanna see me fall
Have faith in me

I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you fall, and I always meant it
If you didn't have this chance, then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again
I said I'd never let you go (Go), and I never did (Did)
I said I'd never let you fall (Fall) and I always meant it (Meant it)
If you didn't have this chance, then I never did
You'll always find me right there, again

I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did
I said I'd never let you go, and I never did32Embed
