You Already Know What You Are Lyrics
They used to tell me you got to choose a side
Now it's four years later, and they beg for advice
Don't trust the critic, he's a cynic, make the call for yourself
This is my 10-step course to not be like everyone else

And I know it's not the easiest route
And I know it leaves you overflowing with doubt
But if you want it, you can have it, hope it's all that you dreamt
'Cause once you got it, forget it, I won't be leaving this

You can't trust everyone you meet
They won't amount to anything
Go tell them, go tell them
It's not as simple as you think
You can't trust everyone you meet
They never meant that much to me
Go tell them, go tell them
It's not as simple as you think


Clenched fists held above me
You will never bring me to my knees, I said
Clenched fists held above me
You will never bring me to my knees
You'll get what you deserve!2Embed
