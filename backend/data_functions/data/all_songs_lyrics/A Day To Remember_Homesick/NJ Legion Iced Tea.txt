NJ Legion Iced Tea Lyrics
Get up, get out, this is your wake up call
We run this town, and you can't fight us all
We keep 'em coming back for more
Don't think you can hold us down
We'll tear this building down
Try to be careful what you say

Give it up, your tact is astounding
Find your place and leave us with some
Peace of mind
You do this every time

So, here's to another banner year
We've crossed that thin line, don't try to hold us here
If for just this once, you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself

Get up, get out, who's gonna break your fall
When we don't back down, you're gonna seem so small
We keep 'em running for the door
Just wait, things will come back around
It's too late for them, they're headed straight for a melt down
I'm not a part of your cliche
Give it up, your tact is astounding
Find your place and leave us with some
Peace of mind
You do this every time

So, here's to another banner year
We've crossed that thin line, don't try to hold us here
If for just this once, you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself
So, here's to another banner year
We've crossed that thin line, don't try to hold us here
If for just this once, you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself

Just think about, just think about everything
Be careful now, be careful what you say while I'm away

This is the life we chose, this is the life I lead
They can never take this from me
This is the life we chose, this is the life I lead
They can never take this from me!

So, here's to another banner year
We've crossed that thin line, don't try to hold us here
If for just this once, you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself
So, here's to another banner year
We've crossed that thin line, don't try to hold us here
If for just this once, you'd think of us
I hope you're happy with yourself

So, here's to another banner year
I hope you're happy with yourself4Embed
