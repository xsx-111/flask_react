If you are hungry I will
Bake some bread for you
If you are worried I will
Hold your head for you
If you can't sleep at night I will
Screen your dreams for you
And if you feel uptight I will
Make everything alright for you
If the key don't work / knock on the door
If the key don't work / knock on the door
No matter how far away you seem I am always
Here at homeEmbed
