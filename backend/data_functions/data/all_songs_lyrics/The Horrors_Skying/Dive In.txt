Dive In Lyrics
She laid her thoughts out on the table
With sorrow difficult and bright
She had decided to sever her ties
As the horizon burned, she turned
The wind combed through her hair like high notes
Tinkling furrows across the sky
There would be tears, flowers, long shadows
She could see it now
The jets would dive

Away, away, away you go
Before they push you under
Away, away, away you go
Before they pull you in

She held herself up at the high point
A joining of decision and dismay
And clay was forming over her feet
As the horizon blurred
She turned and she knew

Away, away, away you go
Before they push you under
Away, away, you let it go
Before it pulls you in
Cold into the current, there she goes 
The way it is, the way it goes
The way it gets you down, you know
The way it is, the way it goes
The way it gets you down

Away, away, away you go
Before they push you under, you know
Away, away, away you go
Before it pulls you in

Away, away, you let it go
Before they put posh under the ground
Away, away, you let it go
Before it pulls you inEmbed
