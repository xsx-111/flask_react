Oceans Burning Lyrics
In the orchard we see you once again
Listening only with the sunlight on your arms
It's a change to see you in my world again
Only visiting but happy anyway

It's a joy
To see you waiting there
Lit up, left glowing in the air
It's a joy
To know you're waiting there
Writing letters, left burning in the air

In the picture we see you once again
Still leaning with the sunlight on your arms
Then the life sent itself into the air
Until someone came upon the frozen stare


Bringing all wonders to light
Bringing all wonders to light 
Like an ocean
Life that overcomes
Like an ocean
Likely follows right behind
The only one
On a lonely ship, we are
Waking like an ocean which is sighing oh
Even when i told you were wrong
Turns out you were right all along
Hold me open when i am with you
Hold me open when i am with you
You know it's gone
You see me run
As if to hide
There on a lonely ship, filled full
Of an ocean which is burning oh
Melt together when i am with you
Held together when i am with you
We had it there
We had it there
I could have sworn
Turns out you were right all along Embed
