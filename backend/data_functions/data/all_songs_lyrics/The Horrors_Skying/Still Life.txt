Still Life Lyrics
Under a sky, no one sees
Waiting, watching it happening
Don't hurry, give it time
Things are the way they have to be
Slow down, give it time
Still life, you know I'm listening
The moment that you want is coming if you give it time

When you wake up, when you wake up
You will find me 

Under a sky, no one else sees
Your shape appears in front of me
The sky clears, the sun hits, I'm here
Waiting, it's happening
The moment that you want is coming if you give it time
