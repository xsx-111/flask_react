Endless Blue Lyrics
Everyone seems so far away
Glittering jewels that you never had
You'll never own
Everything seems so far behind
See yourself in the places you've been
Some other time

In endless blue
Reflections look so good
You're never certain of anything
Unless you go in
Endless blue
Seems so far away
A glittering jewel that you never had
Nor will you again
At high tide, high tide


At high tide, high
As far as you can see
At high tide, high tide
Endless, endless, endless
It's endless1Embed
