Moving Further Away Lyrics
Everybody moving further away 

See you where the light ends
I'll be shooting across the silver
Through the breaking sky
And back before you know
Wheeling in formation
And i know what you're thinking
So turn your eyes away
And let me be alone

Everybody moving further away 

See you where the lie turns
I'll be shooting caps of silver
But it's different now
I'm the only one who flies
Wheeling in formation
And i know what you're thinking
But they're all strangers now
And the silver doesn't shine
Everybody moving further away 

There with all the people
There with all the people
Oh, i surrender, this is
Oh, i surrender, this is it Embed
