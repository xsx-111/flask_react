Was It a Lie? Lyrics
The yard was cold and dark
The tracks were clearly marked
But she was tired, she didn't see
She was just out alone
She wasn't going home
She was going somewhere far away
The train was moving through
As we know the world has to do
Everyone will say it was her fault
Somewhere, a camera placed
Inside this awful place
The accident is about to start

Was it a lie?
Was it a lie?

Did it fill your head?
Did it entertain?
Will you feel alive at the end of it?

When the collision came
She died right away
Her body flung almost sixty feet
And as she split in two
Was she coming straight for you?
And do you have a camera for a face?
Was she your TV show?
Was she your video?
A woman's pain: never private, always seen
I want to close my eyes
I want to cut the wires
I want a day not made for you to see
Was it a lie?
Was it a lie?

Did it fill your head?
Did it entertain?
Will you feel alive at the end of it?

When you play it back to me, it feels more like a parody
Now, it's all I will ever be
That's all I will ever be
(You broadcast it in 50 states)
I really don't care about it
(Looped her death on the internet)
I don't care if it's cold
(And a woman's life got cheaper that day)
Now, I want to be the prettiest wreck you've seen
(A woman's life got cheaper that day)

Did it fill your head?
Did it entertain?
Will you feel alive at the end of it?1Embed
