The Swimmer Lyrics
The swimmer is so far from the distant shore
The only time she never feels alone
On the land, her body distorts
In the water, lines are true to her mind

I can hardly see you now
Are you getting closer?
And do you know you're the one?
They will never understand
How washed up you feel on land
The spotlight of the sun, it shines on

The swimmer knows she'll never touch the floor
She can float unharmed by murky wars
And the land is as plain as her skin
But the water shines like the star in her mind

I can hardly see you now
Are you getting closer?
And do you know you're the one?
They will never understand
How washed up you feel on land
The spotlight of the sun, it shines on1Embed
