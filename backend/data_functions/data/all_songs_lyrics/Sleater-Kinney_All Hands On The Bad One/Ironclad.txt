Ironclad Lyrics
You went down in the very first round
Sitting ringside in a tiny town
Knock out, knock out
First round, first round

When you call, you will call the loudest
When you fall, you will fall the hardest

This could be our very last stand
The Monitor and the Merrimack
Too bad, too bad
You're ironclad, ironclad

When you call, you will call the loudest
When you fall, you will fall the hardest

Who do you love, who do you love, who do you love?
What would you kill, what would you kill, what would you kill?
To make a heart stand still, heart stand still, heart stand still?
What would you pay, what would you pay, what would you pay?
To make the hate go away, hate go away, hate go away?
When you call, you will call the loudest
When you fall, you will fall the hardest
Why battle-cry?
Dry your eyes, no one can hear you
Once iron made, heart or spade
No one can steal you1Embed
