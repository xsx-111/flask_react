Pompeii Lyrics
And then one fine morning
(What you want)
She woke, she knew
(You might never have)
One long look at her life
(Wait for it)
It was you
(Comes back a scar)
Come hell or high water
Her heart was made
No friend and no lover
Will get in her way

For six long years, happiness spoke
(Take your time, no hurry up)
But then the time was up
(Change your mind)
The spell was broke
(Back to the start)
She said, "What I have done to get my way?
What I have done to get this day?"
I want fortune weary love
Fortune weary love
Baby, don't you dare give up on me now
Baby, don't you dare give up on me now

You're gonna find out
You're gonna get low
It's gonna darken your soul
You're gonna find out
You're gonna get low
It's gonna darken your soul
You're gonna fall down
You're gonna grow old
It's gonna darken your soul

I want fortune weary love
Fortune weary love
Baby, don't you dare give up on me now
Baby, don't you dare give up on me now
Get upEmbed
