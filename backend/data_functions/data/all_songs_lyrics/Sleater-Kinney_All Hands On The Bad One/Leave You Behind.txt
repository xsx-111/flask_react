Leave You Behind Lyrics
Wonder how you looked the day you were erased
Look down at your heart and watch it fade
Did you disappear or were you just misplaced?
Left behind with no one else to blame

It's all gone but something lingers on
(Are you letting go?
Thinking clearer now that it's over
There's no one to blame)
A place I used to call home
(As we walk away)
Now, me, you and the ghost
(Why is it I just feel so heavy?
What do I take away?)
Looking for the thing we lost

When you're in the room, it's all that I can feel
Get so used to loving what's not real
There's nothing I can hold, no real tears to cry
You can't breathe life back into a lie

It's all gone but something lingers on
(Are you letting go?
Thinking clearer now that it's over
There's no one to blame)
A place I used to call home
(As we walk away)
Now, you, me and the ghost laughing
(Why is it I just feel so heavy?
What do I take away?)
There's nothing left for you to lose
There's nothing left for you to lose
There's nothing left for you to lose

It's all gone but something lingers on
(Are you letting go?
Thinking clearer now that it's over
There's no one to blame)
A place I used to call home
(As we walk away)
Now, you, me and the ghost
(Why is it I just feel so heavy?
What do I take away?)
Looking for the one we lostEmbed
