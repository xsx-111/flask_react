#1 Must Have Lyrics
Bearer of the flag from the beginning
Now, who would have believed this riot girl's a cynic?
But they took our ideas to their marketing stars
And now I'm spending all my days at girlpower.com
Trying to buy back a little piece of me
(Everywhere you go they say
"Hello, weren't you the one that sold your soul?"
Everywhere you go they say
"Oh no, weren't you the one that let us go?")

And I think that I sometimes might have wished
For something more than to be a size six
But now my inspiration rests
In between my beauty magazines and my credit card bills

I've been crawling up so long on your stairway to heaven
And now I no longer believe that I wanna get in
And will there always be concerts where women are raped?
Watch me make up my mind instead of my face
The number one must have is that we are safe
(Everywhere you go, teenage is the rage
Inside your pants and on the front page
Everywhere you look, it's die or be born
If you can't decide, it's your own war)
And I think that I sometimes must have wished
For something more than to be a size six
But now my inspiration rests
In between my beauty magazines and my credit card bills

No more
No more
No more

And for all the ladies out there
I wish we could write more than the next marketing bid
Culture is what we make it, yes it is
Now is the time
Now is the time
Now is the time to invent
Invent, invent, invent
