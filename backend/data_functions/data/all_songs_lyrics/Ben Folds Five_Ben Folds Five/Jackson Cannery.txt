Jackson Cannery Lyrics
Stop the bus
I wanna be lonely
When seconds pass slowly
And years go flying by
You gotta stop the bus
I'll get off here
Enough's enough
I'm leaving this factory

All she wants
Is food on the table
I won't be able
To bring it home
No I won't, come on
'Cause all l need, yeah is free
'Cause I'm a factory

Did Mother Nature tell you
Boy you come and go as you please
That's what she said to me
But Big Brother got the keys
And I got Jackson Cannery
Millionaires and mill rats live side by side here
Messed up my brother's mind
He's far from Earth
Tell me what's he worth (nothing)
The same as you the same as me
In this factory

Did Mother Nature tell you
Boy you come and go as you please
That's what she said to me
But Big Brother got the keys
And I got Jackson Cannery

(Whoa)(Come on)(Whoa)(Whoa)
(That's pretty good, try it again)
(Whoa)
It's 4 in the morning
Mother don't know
That I'm going far away
She's whispering to the moon
I hope he don't join you soon

Baby boss
Climbs up on his soapbox
But Great Caesar's ghost
Knows what's best for me
He says stop the bus
Did Mother Nature tell you
Boy you come and go as you please
That's what she said to me
But Big Brother got the keys
And I got Jackson Cannery
Did Mother Nature tell you
Boy you come and go as you please
That's what she said to me
But Big Brother got the keys
And I got Jackson CanneryEmbed
