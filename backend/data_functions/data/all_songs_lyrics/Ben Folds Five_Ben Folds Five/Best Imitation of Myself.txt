Best Imitation of Myself LyricsI feel like a quote out of context
Withholding the rest
So I can be for you what you want to see
I've got the gesture and sounds
Got the timing down
It's uncanny, yeah, you'd think it was me
Do you think I should take a class
To lose my southern accent?
Did I make me up, or make the face till it stuck?
I do the best imitation of myself
The "problem with you" speech
You gave me was fine
I liked the theories about my little stage
And I swore I was listening
But I started drifting
Around the part about me acting my age
Now if it's all the same
I've people to entertain
You know I juggle one handed
Do some magic tricks and
The best imitation of myself
Maybe I'm thinking myself in a hole
Wondering who I am, when I ought to know
Straighten up now time to go
Fool somebody else
Fool somebody else
Last night I was East with them and West within
Trying to be for you what you wanna see
But I can't help it with you
The good and bad comes through
Don't want you hanging out with no one but me
Now if it's all the same
It comes from the same place
And if my mind's somewhere else
You won't be able to tell
I do the best imitation of myself
Yes it's uncanny to see
You'd really think it was me
The best imitation of myself
The best imitation of myself1Embed
