Julianne Lyrics
I met this girl, she looked like Axl Rose
Got drunk and took her home and we slept in our clothes
And in the morning, put my feet on the floor and thought:
"Being awake never felt like this before"

And Julianne, you know she wouldn't approve
Talked all day on the phone 'cause I had nothing to do
Got rid of Axl by the afternoon
Being awake never felt so clear and blue

That's all I knew
Guess that I was innocent too
I sing a song, yeah, and it won't be the blues
'Cause I don't miss Julianne

My friend, she told me she felt sorry for me
She said the truth would come crashing down on me
That I'd feel sorry but the truth of it is
That I feel guilty for not giving a sh-

That's all I knew
Guess that I was innocent too
I'll sing a song, yeah, and it won't be the blues
'Cause I don't miss Julianne
I got a bag of trash, I got my bag of trash
I walk it up and down, I drag it up and down the road
How could she miss a man
Who drags a bag of trash down the road?

This week, I feel like I've been born again
You know that Julianne, she would have a fit
She'd find a reason for the things that I did
And gave me credit for the things that I've never been

That's all I knew
Guess that I was innocent too
I can try just as hard as I can
And I don't miss Julianne
That's all I knew
Guess that I was innocent too
Yeah, I can try just as hard as I can
But I don't miss JulianneEmbed
