Philosophy Lyrics
Won't you look up at the skyline
At the mortar, block, and glass
And check out the reflections in my eyes
See they always used to be there
Even when this all was grass
And I sang and danced about a high-rise

And you were laughing at my helmet hat
Laughing at my torch

Go ahead you can laugh all you want
I got my philosophy 
And I trust it like the ground 
That's why my philosophy 
Keeps me walking when I'm falling down 

I see that there is evil
And I know that there is good
And the in-betweens I never understood
Would you look at me I'm crazy
But I get the job done
Yeah, I'm crazy but I get the job done
I say, go ahead you can laugh all you want
But I got my philosophy 
And I trust it like the ground 
That's why my philosophy 
Keeps me walking when I'm falling down 

I pushed you 'cause I loved you guys
I didn't realize
That you weren't having fun
And I dragged you up the stairs
And I told you to fly
You were flapping your arms
Then you started to cry, you were too high
No, too high

Now you take this all for granted
You take the mortar, block, and glass
And you forget the speech that moved the stone
But it's really not that you can't see
The forest for the trees
You just never been out in the woods alone

So you can laugh all you want to
But I've got my philosophy 
And I love you, you're my friend 
But you got no philosophy 
Now it's time for this song to end Embed
