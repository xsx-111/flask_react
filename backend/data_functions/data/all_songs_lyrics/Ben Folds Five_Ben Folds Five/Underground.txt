Underground Lyrics
I was never cool in school
I'm sure you don't remember me
And now it's been ten years
I'm still wondering who to be
But I'd love to mix in circles, cliques, and social coteries
That's me
Hand me my nose ring!
(Can we be happy?)
Show me the mosh pit!
(Can we be happy?)
We can be happy underground

(Who's got the looks?
Who's got the brains?
Who's got everything?)
I've got this pain in my heart, that's all
(Hey you with the long and lonely face)
Well there's got to be something else
And let me tell you something else
There was a girl that passed me by
She gave a smile but I was shy and I looked down
So down
(Don't look down no no - go go underground)
But now there's a place to go
It's the morning now, it's the evening, it's everything
I click my heels and I'm there
(Underground, underground)
Everything's happy underground
(Underground) You been kicked around
(Underground) Did life bring you down here?
Everything's heavy underground

And we'll be decked in all black
Slamming the pit fantastic
Officer Friendly's little boy's got a mohawk and he knows just where we're comin' from
(It's industrial, work it underground)
Get down (yeah), get down (yeah), get down
Yeah

(Underground, underground)
Everything's happy underground
(Underground) You been kicked around
(Underground) Did life bring you down here?
Everything's heavy underground
We can be happy, we can be happy, we can be happy underground

We can, we can, we can be!
Everything's happening!
(Underground, underground)
Everything's happy underground
(Underground) You been kicked around
(Underground) Did life bring you down here?
Everything's happy underground

Bye-bye!Embed
