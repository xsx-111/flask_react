Burning Lyrics
On a drive, I'm takin' back roads
High against where the rivers are flowin'
I didn't think that our love had grown
You had me dead to rights
Hey, I'm trying to get some rest
To keep on movin'

How you been? You looking back?
You tried to change your burnin' boat
Until you realized what you were up against
I spent all those nights just trying to take you in
'Til you released me

Cross the bridge to redefine your pain
When the answer's in your heart
Wide awake, I rearrange the way I listen in the dark
Dreamin', startin'
Up again

So if you look, you'll find yourself
You're not the demon in the dark
But you and I, yeah, we've been through that
Oh, can you rectify all the time it took you
Away from choosin'?
So as you find yourself flyin' high up there
When you release me from your heart again (Woo!)
I'm just a burnin' man tryin' to keep the shit
From turnin' over again

Cross the rich, derivative of pain
Crush the burnin' in your heart
Wide awake to redefine the way you listen in the dark
Dreamin', startin'
Like a stranded kid in a doorway
Just burnin'

Yeah, if I take the light of day

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-hoo!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-hoo!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!Embed
