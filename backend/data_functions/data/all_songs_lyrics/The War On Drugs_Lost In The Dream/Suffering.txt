Suffering Lyrics
In the corner, way that you come that you gave me
In a way that you come and make it alright
I was here in the world, it's the world that you gave me
Every time

You can say that you're running
'Cause I can go back on the street
Why be here when we're both gonna fake it
Anyway?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I won't try, then I hear you killing your goals
Means I can be bigger than the tones
In the moments
Of suffering

Like a feeling that you gave me
Like a snowflake through the fire, babe
I'll be frozen in time
Will you be here
Suffering?

Will you be here
Suffering?
Will you be here
Suffering?
What a room to be in

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah14Embed
