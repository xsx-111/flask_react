Under the Pressure Lyrics
Well, the comedown here was easy
Like the arrival of a new day
But a dream like this gets wasted
Without you

Under the pressure
Is where we are
Under the pressure
Yeah, it's where we are, babe

Oh, you're the only one
Like an illusion

When it all breaks down and we're runaways
Standin' in the wake of our pain
And we stare straight into nothin'
But we call it all the same
You were raised on a promise
Found that over time
Better come around to the new way
Or watch as it all breaks down here
Under the pressure


Well, the break down here
Stole it all the way across
I wanna climb downhill
Stranded on
When you come here and I'm wasted
Lyin' on a field, dancin' in the rain
Hidin' in the back, loosenin' my grip
Wadin' in the water, just tryin' not to crack

Under the pressure
Yeah, it's where we are, babe
Under the pressure
Woo!18Embed
