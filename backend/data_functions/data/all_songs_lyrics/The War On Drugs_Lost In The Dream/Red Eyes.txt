Red Eyes Lyrics
Come and see
Where I witness everything
On my knees
You beat it down to get to my soul
Against my will
Anyone could tell us you're coming
Baby don't mind
Leave it on the line, leave it hanging on a rail

Come and ride away
It's easier to stick to the old
Surrounded by the night
Surrounded by the night, and you don't give in
But you abuse my faith
Losing every time but I don't know where
You're on my side again
So ride the heat wherever it goes
I'll be the one to care, woo!

You're all I've got, wait
Don't wanna let the dark night cover my soul
Well, you can see it through the darkness coming my way
Well, we won't get lost inside it all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, my ride
No one sees me when I'm right here waiting
They don't mind that I'm here, I hear
Throw the big weight of your mind against it
I would keep you here, but I can't

Oh, I am trying to see the right way
I don't see it anywhere I come, babe
Yeah, woo!

Lost on my sea again
The easy way to cover my sin
Don't want another dark time think to myself
Yeah, I won't get lost inside it all, you're on my way
Well, I can see it, the darkness covering my mind
Well, we can hear the voices war inside, yeah
They won't get lost inside it all
You're on my way, woo!35Embed
