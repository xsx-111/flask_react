In Reverse Lyrics
You've been out in the street
Talkin' 'bout the war with me
In the background is the night
Don't wanna hesitate
Well, they tell me where you're hidin'
But through the haze, there's no one there
Wonderin' if you care
Callin' out your name in the darkness

When I'm done with my time here
And my keepsake is strollin'
Through the railways
But I never mind goin'
And I realize now
That the road is bare
And I hear it all
Through the grand parade

And I don't mind you disappearing
'Cause I know you can be found
Maybe livin' on the dark side of the street
Damn
When we're livin' in the moment
And losin' our grasp
Makin' it last
With a grand parade in our past
Sometimes I wait
For the cold wind to blow
As I struggle with myself right now
As I let her darkness in
But I don't mind chasin' you
Through the back ways for the keys
It evaporates and fades
Like a grand parade

And I don't mind you disappearing
When I know you can be found
When you're livin' on the dark side of the street
Damn
We're just livin' in the moment
Makin' our past
Losin' our grasp
Through the grand parade

I'll be here or I'll fade away
Never cared 'bout movin'
Never cared 'bout now
Not the notes I'm playin'
Is there room in the dark
In between the changes?
Like a light that's driftin'
In reverse, I'm movin'5Embed
