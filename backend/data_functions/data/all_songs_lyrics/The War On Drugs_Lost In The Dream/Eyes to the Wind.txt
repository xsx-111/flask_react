Eyes to the Wind Lyrics
I was sailin' down here on the wind
When I met you
And I fell away again
Like a train in reverse down a dark road
Carryin' the whole load
Just rattlin' the whole way home

Have you fixed your eyes to the wind?
Will you let it pull you in again
On the way back in?
I’m a bit run down here at the moment
Let me think about it, babe
Let me roll in

There’s a cold wind blowin' down my old road
Down the back streets where the pines grow
As the river splits the undertows
But I’d be lyin' to myself if I said I didn’t mind
Leave it hangin' on the line, lost inside my head
Is this the way I’ll be denied again?

So I'll set my eyes to the wind
But it won’t be easy
To leave it all again
Just a bit run down here on the scene
There's just a stranger
Living in me

As you set your eyes to the wind
And you see me pull away again
Haven't lost it on a friend
Just a bit run down here at the moment
And I'm all alone here
Livin' in darkness (Alright)6Embed
