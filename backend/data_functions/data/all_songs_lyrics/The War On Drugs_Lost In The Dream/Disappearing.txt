Disappearing Lyrics
All the way to connect, so I wave back
And all the way to the corner every day
You were there for me

But will you wait for the one that disappears?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was home when you came, it threw me out of touch
It took away from the cold of your arms
Now I wait for my turn to let it blow against me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Will you wait for the one that disappears?7Embed
