Lost in the Dream Lyrics
Lost in the dream
Or just the silence of a moment?
It's always hard to tell
Down in the way
They cut it open and they sold it
It's always hard to tell

I saw a soldier man
And he locked his eyes like they were rings
Ooh, but it's hard, I can't resist
You may risk it all
You'd risk it all for the memory
But it's livin' under your skin
Love's the key to the things that we see
And don't mind chasin'
Leave the light on in the yard for me, oh

When we were the same
We stroked our arms and we wore them thin
Ah, the sadness it was in
But you don't miss it, man
You got it all like a memory
Now it's livin' under your skin
Love's the key to the games that we play
But don't mind losin'
Love's the key to the things that you see
But you don't mind movin'
It's a door in the dark in the way
It's the key in the dark for the spark
Love's a game, all the way the same
Oh, all the way3Embed
