An Ocean in Between the Waves Lyrics
Run away, I'm a travelin' man
Been workin' every day
I watch you as you hesitate
Walkin' through the rain
I bet against the company again
They try to redefine
Everything that I know and love
I gotta know you're mine
Yeah

Feel the way that the wild wind blows through the room
Like a nail down through the heart
That just don't beat the same anymore
That might as well be gone

I'm in my finest hour
Can I be more than just a fool?
It always gets so hard to see
Right before the moon

Far away, Ma, there's a black sun risin' overhead
There's a moon through the midnight rain
How can I surround myself in time and time again?
How can I be free?
Just wanna lie in the moonlight
And see the light shine in, see you in the outline
It never gets too dark to find
Anybody at any time
I'm at the darkened hillside
And there's a haze right between the trees
And I can barely see you
You're like an ocean in between the waves

Waitin', waitin'
Stallin', stallin'
I wanna tie
All the talk
You’ve got to rise if it gets to here
Oh, see

I'm waitin'
You’ve got to lean up against
On my mind on this fast slide
And I can't go back again
I've got to rise if it gets to here
Hold strong, hold on
Alright
I keep waitin'
You've got to lean on my chest
Come here
'Cause I can't go back again
You’ve got to rise if it gets to here
Hold strong, let me in
Hold strong
I'm waitin'
I'm leanin' up against
One more start
Yeah, I can't go back again
You've got to rise if it gets to here
Hold strong, woo!
I'm waitin'
I'm waitin'9Embed
