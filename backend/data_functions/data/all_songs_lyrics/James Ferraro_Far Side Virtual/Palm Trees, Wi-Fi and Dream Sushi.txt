Palm Trees, Wi-Fi and Dream Sushi Lyrics
(Japanese)

I am your touch screen waiter, tap

Welcome to i-cuisine
Here you go monsieur, please take a look at the virtual sushi menu
Player One has chosen one California roll, right away sir
Your dish is being prepared by top chef Gordon Ramsay

Hello, I am Virtual Chef Number 2
Would you like to taste some wine?
Try the masterful taste of Dubai's finest wineries
Laughing
There you go sir, and madam, would you care for a bit a sake

Who sir?
More wine
Yes yes, please
Another look at the menu?
You got it sir!
Anything you want, just give us a shout
By the way, the chef suggests the Australian coral reef roll
1000 pounds
You have arrived on Dubai's finest virtual restaurant, all of Times Square can see you, say hello
Dish number one, gartted shark roll is being served
Another platter of that's green calamari reed.

Oh, sir?
Richard Branson's avatar says hello
Order: 3 Sonic water sushiEmbed
