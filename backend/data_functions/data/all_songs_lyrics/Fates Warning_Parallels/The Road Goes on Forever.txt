The Road Goes on Forever LyricsIt's so cold, in the shadow of distant lights
And the chilling wind slows our pace and tests our will
Still a voice whispers, it will be over soon
And there we find the courage to climb the hill
Sometimes I lose sight of where I'm going
Fanned by a flame, I can't remember
But distant lights still burn bright
And the road goes on forever
Year after year and with renewed ambition
We scale the walls to find there's nothing there
Still idle hands clutch the empty page
With the passion of our desperate prayer
Sometimes I lose sight of where I'm going
Fanned by a flame, I can't remember
But distant lights still burn bright
And the road goes on forever
And here we are again
The doors close behind us
And the road goes on and on and on and on
Sometimes I lose sight of where I'm going
Fanned by a flame, I can't remember
But distant lights still burn bright
And the road goes on forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, foreverEmbed
