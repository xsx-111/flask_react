The Eleventh Hour LyricsI know it's getting late
But I feel I need, I need to explain
All the laughter and the lies
Can't stay the fear or hide the pain
Somewhere along the way
We exchanged our dreams for selfish pride
There was a common goal
But somehow that vision has died
Is it so hard to understand
The facts that you ignore
And we've grown so tired of trying
Wasting our time criticizing
And nothing's easy anymore
Nothing's easy anymore
Is it too late to understand
The writing that's on the walls
While we watch time slip through our hands
We're deaf to our own demands
When the eleventh hour calls
The eleventh hour calls
And nothing's easy anymore
When the eleventh hour calls
The eleventh hour calls
I know it's getting late
But I feel I need, I need to explain1Embed
