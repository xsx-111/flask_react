Point of View LyricsLooking out on a familiar scene
There's no agreement in what we see
Your perception lacks clarity
And my perspective is blinding me
Side by side
Divided they stand
Parallel lives running parallel with you
To the point where our horizons divide
My opinion is just a point of view
And your position is the other side
Caught up in our convictions we forget
How our senses distort things we see
We can't accept our differences
But we can always disagree
Side by side
Divided they stand
Parallel lives running parallel with you
To the point where our horizons divide
My opinion is just a point of view
And your position is the other side
Where I stand is not so far from you
A different opinion is just another point of view
Parallel lives running parallel with you
To the point where our horizons divide
My opinion is just a point of view
And your position is the other side
Parallel lives running parallel with you
To the point where our horizons divide
My opinion is just a point of view
And your position is the other side
Parallel lives running parallel with you
To the point where our horizons divide
My opinion is just a point of view
And your position is the other side...Embed
