Coming Down Glass LyricsThem trashy types just outta milk teeth
Keep bluffin' me with their big girly eyes
Them trashy types them college girls
Don't know squat 'bout guys like me
She don't do nothin' but flirt an' lie
She don't do nothin' but wink an' smile
Too tight in the crotch too proud for
Daddy's little girl too good for
Who's that knocking who who's that knocking
He's coming down glass he's coming down glass
Who's that knocking who who's that knocking
He's coming down glass he's coming down glass
Play with a puppy an' he'll lick your mouth
Mockingbirds makin' light of me
Those pussywillows just break my heart
Sweeter than syrup in pinching high heels
Who's that knocking who who's that knocking
He's coming down glass he's coming down glass
Who's that knocking who who's that knocking
He's coming down glass he's coming down glass
Them trashy types just outta milk teeth
Keep bluffin' me with their big girly eyes
Them trashy types them college girls
Don't know squat 'bout guys like me
Who's that knocking who who's that knocking
He's coming down glass he's coming down glass
Who's that knocking who who's that knocking
He's coming down glass he's coming down glass

I'm going down and have no shame
I'm going down and have no shame
I'm going down and have no shame
I'm going down and have noEmbed
