Let Me Sleep LyricsLet me sleep I'm through now
I'll just close my eyes
I know I didn't do it
It's too late to explain
I'm tired - he's screaming
He knows where I've been
I was gonna say something
Maybe
He says I taste like rubber
I can't change his mind
He thinks he's right
He thinks I'm lying
I've heard stories like this
But not about me
I'm tired - he's screaming
He knows where I've beenEmbed
