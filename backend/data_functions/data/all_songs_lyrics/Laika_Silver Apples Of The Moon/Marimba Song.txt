Marimba Song LyricsOh the moon is giving sunshine
Sky's full of wine
Big ol' bear prickly pear
I wanna live in your
Fuzzy bits an' kissin' lips
Curly hair and squeezy hips
Places where I just fit in you
Never had the luck to see god's hands
Not even his fingernails
But if he has a voice it's just like yours
Butter and honey and milk and water
Milk and water
Milk and water
Moon is giving sunshine
Sky's full of wine
Clouds are pouring red
Stars are pouring white
So much raining down on me I just lose my...
Moon is giving sunshine
Sky's full of wine
Big ol' bear prickly pear
I wanna live in your...
Night and day day and night
Night and day day and night
Moon is giving sunshine
Sky's full of wine
Big ol' bear prickly pear
I wanna live in your
Flutter-bys and butterflies
That frame your big round eyes
An' make lightning strike twice inside
Make lightning strike twice inside
So much light sky's so bright
So much light sky's so bright
Clouds are pouring red
An' the stars are pouring white
Clouds are pouring red
An' the stars are pouring white
Lightning strike twice inside
Night and day day and night
Lightning strike twice inside
Moon is giving sunshine
Sky's full of wine
Clouds are pouring red
Stars are pouring whiteEmbed
