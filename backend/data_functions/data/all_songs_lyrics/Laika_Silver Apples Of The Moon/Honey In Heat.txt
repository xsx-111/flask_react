Honey In Heat LyricsMenfolks just don't understand
Sympathy for a wretch like me
I'm a handle to wind the tongue
Just a bitch in heat
Menfolks just can't even see
My fifty puppies and tits to my knees
Stretch marks - hair like grease
Just a bitch in heat
Yeah I want it bad
So bad I'm howlin'
And all you dogs sniffin' butts outside
Don't need it half as much as me...
Dachshunds and st. bernards
Going mad in my front yard
Big and small - I'll have 'em all
Just a bitch in heat
Menfolks just can't conceive
I'm at the mercy of chemistry
Every spring you get itchy feet
Ain't nothin' compared to this heat
I'm honey in heat with nothin' to do
'cept wait around for mutts like you
I guess I'm just an easy lay
Until they day they get me...
Yeah I want it bad
So bad I'm howlin'
And all you dogs sniffin' butts outside
Don't need it half as much as need it half as much as
Yeah I want it bad
So bad I'm howlin'
And all you dogs swingin' cats outside
Don't need it half as much as meEmbed
