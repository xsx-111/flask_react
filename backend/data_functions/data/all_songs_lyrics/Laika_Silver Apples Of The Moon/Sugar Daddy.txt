Sugar Daddy LyricsSugar daddy, take me away from this bad bad place
I'm sick and tired of trying and I wanna fly away
I guess we got our wires crossed
He's thinking driftwood I think twigs
Nothing nothing's gonna save us now
And I wanna fly away
Sugar daddy, take me away from this bad bad place
I'm sick and tired of trying and I wanna fly away
I guess we got our wires crossed
He's thinking driftwood I think twigs
Nothing nothing's gonna save us now
And I wanna fly awayEmbed
