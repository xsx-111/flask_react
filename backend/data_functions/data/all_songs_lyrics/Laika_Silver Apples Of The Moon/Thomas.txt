Thomas LyricsSittin' in the corner
Eye-in' little Jella
Her head all clink-clank
Scary box of knick-knacks
She's always in a scurry-scurry
Shakin' with her worry-worry
Kickin' up a sandstorm
Runnin' up the slide-down
Bee buzz buzzing
Hummin' bird a hummin'
Heart beatin' clip-clop
Burstin' like a pea pod
Sparky little milk pup
Rippin' up the hearthrug
Kickin' up a sandstorm
Runnin' up the slide-down
Kickin' up a sandstorm
Runnin' up the slide-downEmbed
