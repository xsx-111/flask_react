Alternate Route To Vulcan Street LyricsSometimes I ponder
What if the Caspian Sea
Should merger
Over my shoulder
With Irish lakes
And Seoul suburbia
Abandon ship
Abandon ship
Lift me up
High aloft to peace
I didn't know
That you would take it
To heart
I didn't know
That is would break us
Apart this way
Too much
Too soon
Good bye
Yeh! yeh!Embed
