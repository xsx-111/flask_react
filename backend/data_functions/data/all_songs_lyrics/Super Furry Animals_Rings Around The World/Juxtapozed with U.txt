Juxtapozed with U Lyrics
It's easy when you know how
To get along without Biff! Bang! Pow!
And if I see you're fed up
I'll stop and give you a leg up
Overpriced unreal estate, surreal estate
The highest price they've hit to date
Creating new divides and tension

You've got to tolerate
All those people that you hate
I'm not in love with you
But I won't hold that against you
You've got to tolerate
Some of those people that you hate
I'm not in love with you
But I won't hold that against you

This is a tale of two city/situations
Mutual appreciation
Away from narrow preconception
Avoiding conflict hypertension
Non-phobic word aerobic
This was my domain
'Til someone stole my name
You've got to tolerate
All those people that you hate
I'm not in love with you
But I won't hold that against you
You've got to tolerate
Some of those people that you hate
I'm not in love with you
But I won't hold that against you

Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed
Just suppose I juxtapose with you
(I wanna get juxtaposed with you)
Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed
Just suppose I juxtapose with you
(I wanna get juxtaposed with you)
Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed
Just suppose I juxtapose with you
(I wanna get juxtaposed with you)
Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed
Just suppose I juxtapose with you
(I wanna get juxtaposed with you)
You've got to tolerate
All those people that you hate
I'm not in love with you
But I won't hold that against you
You've got to tolerate
Some of those people that you hate
I'm not in love with you
But I won't hold that against you

Let's get juxtaposed1Embed
