No Sympathy LyricsI have no sympathy for you
You make me realise
The who I am
I have no sympathy for thee
You make me realise
The who I am not
Sympathy, sympathy
You want some:
Don't come to me
Don't try me for sympathy
I don't feel sorry for thee:
You deserve to die
I have no adjectives for you
And have no feelings
For the who you are
I feel no empathy for you
You make me realise
The who I am not
Sympathy, sympathy
You want some:
Don't come to me
Don't try me for sympathy
I don't feel sorry for thee:
You deserve to dieEmbed
