Receptacle For The Respectable LyricsIt took a long time for me to get over
Your incredible ways
And now I'm minded to wipe out the memory
Of the way you behave
You're a receptacle (It took a long time for me to discover)
For the respectable (It took some time to get over)
I took some time out to study your actions
Of how you painted towns red
And if my worst fears came to fruition
I'm sure you'd leave us all dead
I was so gullible (It took a long time for me to discover)
But now I'm cynical (It took some time to get over)
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba
We're all susceptible (It took a long time for me to discover)
To the incredible (It took some time to get over)
Tell me, tell me, tell me again
'Cause it's very inane
Are you pleased to see me suffer ever?
Tell me, tell me, explain your game
'cause it's very inane
Are you pleased to see me suffer ever?
Tell me, tell me, tell me again
'cause it's very inane
Are you pleased to see me suffer ever?
Tell me, tell me, explain your game
'cause it's very inane
Are you pleased to see me suffer ever more?
Welcome as a storm cloud in the late December gloom
Subtle as a nail bomb in the head
You came to me in peace and left me in pieces
Receptacle for the respectable
Receptacle for the respectable
Receptacle for the respectable
Receptacle for the respectable (RAAAGHH!!!)
Receptacle for the respectable (RAAAGHH!!!)
Receptacle for the respectable (RAAAGHH!!!!)
