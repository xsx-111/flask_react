Sidewalk Serfer Girl Lyrics
Patti White Bull fell asleep for fifteen years
Then unexpectedly she woke to joy and tears
She ordered pizza and then asked about her kids
They're all grown up now on the reservation grid
Sidewalk surfer girl
I'd do anything to catch you
Falling
Sidewalk surfer girl
I'd do anything to be with you
Sometimes

Since Patti left the scene
Things got so extreme
Sidewalk surfer girls searching for a dream
Paraglide through space die your bungee best
Set yourself alight while famine kills the rest
Sidewalk surfer girl
I'd do anything to catch you
Falling
Sidewalk surfer girl
I'd do anything to be with you
Sometimes
? we'll have fun
She cruises the streets at night she left home on the run
(Swell)
She never talks to me thinks I'm a major yawn
(Excuse me?)
Return the difference don't retake me, I'm no pawn

Sidewalk surfer girl
I'd do anything to catch you
Falling
Sidewalk surfer girl
I'd do anything to be with you
Sometimes
(I dream of sidewalk surfer girl)Embed
