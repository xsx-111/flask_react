Run! Christian, Run! LyricsRapture
Waiting to capture that moment
Postponement
Suspension of rational movement
So bang on the hour of twelve
To the forest clearing we'll delve
With guns to our heads, for we know
That heaven awaits us
Dreaming of that perfect home by the sun
Run, Christian, run
Still dreaming of that perfect home by the sun
Run, Christian, run
Roaming
Roaming from all tribulation
Leaving
Leaving behind all damnation
With women and children in line
The men will then gather behind
With knives to their throats they'll depart
On the midnight train to Jordan
Still dreaming of that perfect home by the sun
Run, Christian, run
Wishing for that perfect home by the sun
Come kingdom come
