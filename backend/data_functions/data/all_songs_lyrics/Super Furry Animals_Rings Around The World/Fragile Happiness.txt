Fragile Happiness LyricsWell that fragile happiness
Keeps me from forgetting
That this fragile happiness
Keeps me afloat when I'm sinking
The first generation
Caused such a sensation
Gave all an elation
But I'm in Deep Space Nine
Hitting wormholes all of the time
But that fragile happiness
Stops the nightmares when I'm sleeping
And where catholics confess
From my guilt there's no escaping
We'll go to Miami
Take old friends and family
We'll stay out and party
Does Will Smith lie?
Does he ever cave in and cry?Embed
