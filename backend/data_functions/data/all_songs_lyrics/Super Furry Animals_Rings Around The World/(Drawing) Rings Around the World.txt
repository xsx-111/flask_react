(Drawing) Rings Around the World Lyrics
You expose the film in me
We're drawing rings around the world
Sooner or later we will melt together
And draw rings around the world
With all those meteoric stones
And all those sheep they never cloned
Okay

I am glowing radioactive
We draw beams around the world
Wish you could see us when we're at our best now
We draw rings around the world
With cans of Post Water in tow
We're gonna vaporize your soul
Ha ha

Earth will become Saturn II
With all those rings around the world
Tetsuo II became me and you
With all those rings around the world
And all those body hammer blows
We're drawing rings around the world
Ha ha
Ring, ring
Ring, ring
Rings around the world
