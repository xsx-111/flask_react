Shoot Doris Day LyricsShoot Doris Day
Out of the way
In the pouring rain
Sentimentality pause
As Jimmy Stewart ignores
Her Question
People never stay the same
It's a fight between the
Wild and tame
I've some feelings that
I can't get through
Even to you my friend
Wasting away in vain
Oh! Mercy
Victor Panache
Lost his moustache
In a P.R. war
Public relationship tears
No one would touch him
For years
People never stay the same...
Rushing around in vain
Don't tempt me
People never stay the same
It's a fight between the
Wild and tame
I've some feelings that
I can't get through
But those feelings never
Bothered you
People never stay the same
It's a fight between the
Strong and lame
I've some feelings that
I can't get through
I'll just binge on crack
And tiramisu
Animals don't stay the same
It's a fight between the
Wild and tame
I've some feelings that
I can't get through
Without turning to a
Military coupEmbed
