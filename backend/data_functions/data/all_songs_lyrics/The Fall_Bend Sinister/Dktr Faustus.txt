Dktr Faustus LyricsDoctor Faustus
Horseshoes splacking
Swallows hay cart, cart horse
Of the peasants blocking his path
Doctor Faustus
Power showing
Spits out hay cart, cart horse hay and box
Outside the gates of the town of Anholt
You've had your chances, you've had your chance
You've had your chances, you've had your chance
Doctor Faustus
At the court of the Count
Made fruits exotic pleasure-licious
Appear behind curtains in Winter
Faustus
At the court of the decadent Count
Made animals from sunny lands appear
In the sparse gardens
You've had your chances, you've had your chance
You've had your chances, you've had your chance
Doctor Faustus
Horseshoes splacking
Swallows hay cart, cart horse
Hay and box
Of the peasants blocking his path
Had to leave
His drinking student friends
Doctor Faustus, Doctor Faustus
Had your chances, you've had your chance
Had your chances, you've had your chance
Had your chances, you've had your chance
Had your chances, you've had your chance
There's a blood silhouette through the ceiling sky
There's a blood silhouette through the ceiling sky
There's a blood silhouette through the ceiling sky
There's a blood silhouette through the ceiling skyEmbed
