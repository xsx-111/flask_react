Terry Waite Sez LyricsTerry Waite Sez
Terry Waite Sez
Terry Waite Sez
Give us a ring, give us a ring kid
Mister Big
Sounding sour and frustrated
With the pressure of his own life
Terry Waite Sez
Terry Waite Sez
What are those trees
Painted white jobs
Silvered something
Silvered something
50 plus
Out to heal provincial pus
Let the real reverend walk
He says and does
He plans but they won't let him in
Terry Waite Sez
Terry Waite!Embed
