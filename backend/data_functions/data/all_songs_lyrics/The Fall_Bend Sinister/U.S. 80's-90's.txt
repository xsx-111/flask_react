U.S. 80's-90's LyricsHad a run-in with Boston Immigration
And to my name had an aversion
Nervous droplets
Due to sleeping tablets
No beer
No cigarettes
Slam, spikes, gin, cigarettes
Beer in ban
The cops are tops
Welcome to the 80s 90s
Welcome to US 80s 90s
I'm the big-shot original rapper
But it's time for me to get off this crapper
Welcome to the US 80s 90s
No beer
No cigarettes
Spikes, gin, cigarettes
Whisky
Like cones of silence
Welcome to the US 80s and 90s
Like 50s, 1890s
Kentucky dead keep pouring down
By death stadium
No more amused dressing room
My ambition, but one chance in three million Jack
Like cones of silence
Cast aside over-inflation theory of the panic insists
Welcome to the US 80s 90s
Look at page 19, small column, lower right-hand side
Welcome to the 1980sEmbed
