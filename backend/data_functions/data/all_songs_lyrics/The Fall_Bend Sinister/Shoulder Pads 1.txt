Shoulder Pads 1 LyricsAll these fads
It's shoulder pads
On New Year's Dawn
To my surprise
All the Macca lads stayed at home
Picking antiques and clothes
Clothes reflect with green bits
(Name on the corner of my stub toes.)
My powers
Have been spent half-useless
My senses
Alive at party
Was embarrassed but stayed with them
Walked, at shoulder, down the street, ridicule
You couldn't tell Lou Reed from Doug Yule
Suppressed big romance
It was like being back at school
My powers (mumble)
My powers (mumble)
Win populace, internal defeat
Gramma had a coup d'etat
Realize what they'd always wanted
Knew I was right all along
It wasn't then a Beatles song
Superhero in harlequin kecks
Dim-wit lecture, half read
Visiplex singers ten years dead
Was clowned
(Bitter man)
Shoulder pads
(Spawned)
Then my powers did return....1Embed
