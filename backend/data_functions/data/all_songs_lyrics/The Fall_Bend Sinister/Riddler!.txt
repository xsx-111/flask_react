Riddler! LyricsSay! Mmmmmm-uuuaahhh
Say! Mmmmmm-uuuaaaah
Say! Mmmmmm--uuuaaaah
Monday night at operation control
I sat facing rows of monitor mountains
Mind control
Life control
Operation mind control
My first is in car
I'm easily bought, but still always short
(Fly that over space beam)
And round my way the people still do say
Ridd-ler
Ridd-ler
And round these parts the people still impart
Riddler!
My second is in..
Zoooooooom!
Say! Mmmmmm
Say! Mmmmmm
And round my way the people still do say
Riddler!
Round these parts the people still impart
Ridd-ler
Ridd-ler
Third: slopes
Fourth: (inverting within)
Round my way the people still do say
Riddler
And round these parts the people still exclaim
Ridd-ler
And even now kids round our place say
RiddlerEmbed
