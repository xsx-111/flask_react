Shoulder Pads 2 LyricsKnew I was right all along
Rock to Them, a Talking Heads album
Superhero in harlequin kecks
Dim-wit lecture, half read
Was I - victim in clown hat?
Was I - nearly turned
Then my powers did return....
Watch out!
Makers of fads
It's MES in shoulder pads
My powers none
Powers, said Batman
Said a twisted chill, flashes pan
It's MES in shoulder pads
Big fit deal for mothers of fads
It's MES in shoulder pads
You'd better
Line that bottom line
Against that different clan
Holding ankles
Rotten kecks
It's MES in shoulder padsEmbed
