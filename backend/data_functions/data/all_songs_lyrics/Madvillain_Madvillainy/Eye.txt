Eye Lyrics
Give me a little bit, a little bit
Just a little bit, or a lot

Pieces of the dream that I pick up in my mind
Is not blind, how I fly
Every day when I look into your brown eyes
I get high, oh how high?
Pieces of the dream that I pick up in my mind
Is not blind, how I fly
Every day when I look into your brown eyes
I get high, I get high
I, I get high
Look in your, brown eyes
I get hi-i-i-igh

Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, higher
Higher, you make me higher
I fly (I fly) I fly (I fly)
I fly (I fly) I fly
I fly (Take me there) I fly (Take me there)
I fly22Embed
