Rainbows Lyrics
You know, you best to watch out (Watch your back nigga)
'Til you, be fresh out of clout (Fresh water trout)
Rumors that (Out of water) he got a mouth on the street (Somebody tell him yo)
You know, you best to watch out (Watch your back nigga)
Who knows, who is watchin' in (Streets is watchin')

Hope, they don't know (They don't know nothin)
As much he thinks, they know
That what, he drinks, Drano
Rat but, she winks, rainbows

(Come on!) Loser, was twice in the fed (Comin' home son)
User, whose nice in the head (Where that shit at, bitch?)
Choose to, entice him with bread (Get paid son)
Air him, they said he was
Ex-pen-dable (Dead him dunn)
Air him, there's no witnesses (Handle your B-I)
Dare him, they said he was
Ex-pen-dable  (Dead 'em dunn)
Air him, there's no witnesses (Handle your B-I)
You know, you best to watch out (Watch your back, nigga)
Who knows, who is watchin in (Nosey, yo)
Hope, they don't know (They don't know nothin')
As much he thinks, they know
That what, he drinks, Drano
Rat but, she winks, rainbows
This Villain was a ruthless mass conqueror
With aspirations to dominate the universe20Embed
