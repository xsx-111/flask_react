Rome Lyrics
Who's the boy you like the most
Is he teasing you with underage?
Could he be waving from a tropical sunset?
Static silhouette somehow
Single in his bed someday
Quiet 'til it falls, falls, falls

Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! What did I say? What can I say?
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen here
I'll be driving, you look the other way

That ain't easy to ignore
When your shutters are open all the way
When it's candlelight I see, I go insane
Distant silhouette somehow
We shared a cigarette somewhere
Addict 'til it falls, falls, falls

Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Focus looking forward the Colosseum
Oh no! What did I say? What can I say?
Rome, Rome, many tears have fallen here
I'll be driving, you look the other way
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome

Always and forevermore
I call to say I'm on the way
Two-thousand years remain in a trash can
That burned a cigarette somewhere
Ashes 'til it falls, falls ,falls

I stand outside under broken leaves
I know I can't do without
The future's trying to wait
I've never loved you, and if I loved you
I wouldn't say that I'm sorry, oh no
I stand outside under broken leaves

Always and forevermore
We're together dead and lonely
I thought I couldn't do this without you
Single in his bed somewhere
Ashes 'til it falls, falls, falls
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome
Rome, Rome, Rome, Rome

What did I say? What can I say?3Embed
