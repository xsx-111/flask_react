Them Eyes Lyrics
Hey, can’t you see my crying
Hey, don't you see me dying
When I look into them eyes

I know that I did you wrong
But baby, you lasted so long
If you don’t bring me back this time
I swear I’m going to lose my mind

Hey, can’t you see my running
Hey, don't you know I’m coming
When I think about them eyes2Embed
