Day One Lyrics
Days turn to night
It reveals itself true light
Back at home out of wrong where it feels right
Days turn to night
It reveals itself true light
Back at home out of wrong where it feels right (heyyyy)

Stay away from
Monetary gain temptation
Feel your inner souls vibration
We are channels for a place from
Deep within where we all came from
Relaxation meditation
Connected to all creation
Infinite but all the same one
(heyyyy) X 14

Days turn to night
It reveals itself true light
Back at home out of wrong where it feels right
Days turn to night
It reveals itself true light
Back at home out of wrong where it feels right (okay)
Drive on my course I drift afloat
Plus the times life is inner mystical
Seein signs see it's planted in the road
More I know more I don't pretend to know
Just a piece and a fragment in the hole
Just a servant not labeled friend or foe
Begin again good or bad is just a mo-
-ment in eternity a fight to get your soul..
Back!

Get your soul back! (get your soul back!)
Get your soul back!
Get your soul back! (get your soul back!)
Get your soul back! (get your soul back!)
Get your soul back! (get your soul.. get your soul..)

Days turn to night
It reveals itself true light
Back at home out of wrong where it feels right (heyyyy)
Days turn to night
It reveals itself true light
Back at home out of wrong where it feels right (heyyyy)
Days turn to night
It reveals itself true light
Back at home out of wrong where it feels right (heyyyy)
Days turn to night
It reveals itself true light
Back at home out of wrong where it feels right (heyyyy)Embed
