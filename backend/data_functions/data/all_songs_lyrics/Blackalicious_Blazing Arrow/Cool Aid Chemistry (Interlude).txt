Cool Aid Chemistry (Interlude) Lyrics
You just keep playing. Can you bring that level up in my earphones?
And you bring their level up in my chairs, cause I'm playing with sticks
And I'm drowning 'em out, so if you can give them more of this
Yeah, you can bring that in even more. Bring up
Yeah. You guys play. Yeah, that's perfect

Sounds of science

Kool'Aid
