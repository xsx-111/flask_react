Make You Feel That Way Lyrics
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way

Up and early for the hope of a brand new day
See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day
Fresh haircut fitted with a fat-ass fade
End of work, we chilling on a Saturday
How you felt when you first heard the Daddy Kane
Rakim, KRS - hey I had that tape
Cooling out with ol' girl on a fat-ass date
Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great
Get promoted at your job up to management
Plot a long time finally a plan has made it
Sometimes I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way

Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way
Christmas Day when your mama got your first bike
Type of feeling when you went and won your first fight
How your team felt winning championship games
Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain
Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen
Put in hard work finally you're living your dream
Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes
Blind man gain his sight see his first sunrise
Young man speaking out, now he's loud and clear
Birthin' your child, smile so proud you wear
Going in your third eye for the styles you hear
Making music that'll bump for a thousand years
Eating right feeling conscious like health is first
Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work
Times I feel I want to shout, man it's real that way
When I'm thinking things that make you feel that way

Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way
All up in her vibe something coming over me
Summer days more likely that you notice breeze
Winter days more likely that you notice heat
When I'm gone, more likely that you notice me
In the dark it's more likely that you notice light
In the light more likely that you notice night
Hungry, more appreciation for that meal
Dead broke, more appreciation for that scrill
A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good
And that'll make things a little better understood
Times I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way

Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way, make you feel that way
Make you feel that way

You know it's like, like the most greatest feeling you could ever feel, y'know
Like just total elation, y'know
Sunny day, just got paid
Y'know it's just like, y'know just the, the most joyous feeling you could ever comprehend, y'know
Chillin' with your family, y'know just, y'know just really, really
Feelin', feelin' the moment to the fullest
Y'know, really, really, really, just chillin' (yeah)
It's love, it's love, it's love7Embed
