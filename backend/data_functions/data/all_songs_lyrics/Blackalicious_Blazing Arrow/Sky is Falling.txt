Sky is Falling Lyrics
Rain and thunder
And lightning crumbling
Buildings falling
Hurricanes Earth shattering
Membranes scattering
Insane happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting down

The sky is falling, life is appalling, and death is lurking
Niggas killing each other leaving bodies nobodies searching for
And juveniles is losin' trials, catching a bit of murder one
And mothers is drinkin' and druggin', hoein', searchin' for they son
And liquor stores upon every corner and younger people
Done accepted defeat in the melting pot of lavas seeping
And the hood is all the mind can conceive when your foes bleeding to their death
And you picking their pocket all to just get even
Niggas is banging, they fathers was banging, they unc's thuggin'
Highly intelligent Africans lowered to punks muggin'
And the coppers is the Klan, and the planet is run by the government
And genocidal thieves, all the while the devil is loving it
And children in high school rollin' through smokin' their classes up
And people that's rich don't be checking for what is happening
Degrading our women, knockin' 'em up, leave 'em, now smack 'em up
And ain't no way to reach us we're sleeping like hell's castle
Sky is falling
Rain and thunder
And lightning crumbling
Buildings falling
Hurricanes Earth shattering
Membranes scattering
Insane happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting down
Rain and thunder
And lightning crumbling
Buildings falling
Hurricanes Earth shattering
Membranes scattering
Insane happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting down

The sky is falling, no one is watching, tornadoes twisting
Whereas nobody is listening and fires no one pays attention
Energies are erupting blurring the intentional vision
Doctors and lawyers and scientists all are locked in the prison
Of the mind, and all the youth are unreachable but they teachable
But emcees don't be teaching them to, they deep down in their soul
Amongst the prostitution and pimping, robbing and stealing
We give a name (Sab- a truth), this is nigga-land (Glad to knew ya)
But give a damn (for the future), religions is institutionalized
Hidden truths, given you the lies
You got two pistols at the head of your own people
It's lethal but it's living proof
Instead of leaving smiles leading death inside of our living room
And instead of college, they got us slangin' after high school
For the love of the money and everything that it will buy you
Everybody out for that and they kill you if you a rival
Twenty lions and one steak on the table, it's about survival
The sky is falling
Rain and thunder
And lightning crumbling
Buildings falling
Hurricanes Earth shattering
Membranes scattering
Insane happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting down

Revelation
From the now captive
To the plantation
Calm I bring the fury
All the rampage done
Drown the confusion
Through the devastation
Live in the trees of elimination
Truth is absolute
Prophets can't wait long
...... ....
Can't take long
Revelation
Devastation
Better stay strongEmbed
