Purify (Interlude) Lyrics
Watch out blazing arrow

Do it just how you talk it
Nigga rolled in and walk it
Stick a toe in the water
Don't falter, go on and fall in
Tell me, do you know your calling?
Yo, what your mission is fella?
I caught this vision when I met a fortune teller
In New Orleans French Quarter
On the bus bench an arbitrary corner
Sorta scary looking elder woman showed up outta nowhere
She stared into my eyes and said
"Sure as I agree
You were conceived and walk the earth
To spit that heat, purifying I believe
So are you ready for your cleansing?
Cause this is only the beginning."Embed
