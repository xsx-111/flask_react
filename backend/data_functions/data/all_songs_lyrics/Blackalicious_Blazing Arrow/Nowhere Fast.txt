Nowhere Fast Lyrics
Now you, who ever you are
As you're listening to what I'm going to say
Will probably not want to believe what I'm going to tell you
And there isn't any way in which I can make you believe;
I can only state the facts as they are
And hope that you will really believe me

Hey yester-day you were supposed to meet me now I got to testify
I waited hours for you guess that all was just a lie
Quick as you stepped inside soon enough you said good bye
"Peace out! I'm gone and won't be back!" I heard your echo cry
Oh how the seconds fly left without a second try
I check and try to recollect how I just let you die
And now I wallow in these severed ties

Of yesterday

Of yester-day girl you're really gone
I guess that's how it just should be
I had big plans for us today but now you're history
Today's a mystery you took pieces I miss of me
I keep on diggin deep tryin to find that kid in me
We had some really good discussions back then didn't we?
Befriended me but now we don't speak like we're enemies
And all I got is memories
Of yesterday

But Yester-day memories are priceless
And I'm really glad you left em
They're etched inside
I take a ride when driftin through the spectrum
It's just at times I dwell and dwell and then I have to catch up
To now while back in time
It ceased to march it and just kept on
I want you back I want you back when it was here I slept on
What I appreciate a little more now as a blessing
Now I'm complaining and regretting

About yesterday

And I'm just goin' nowhere fast

I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
You're stuck in a flurry of illusions goin' nowhere fast

I am today I'm all that was and ever is and uh
It is an honor, don't become a mental prisoner
Just listen to the now and keep your mind from driftin' off
I am the mission, the position of this instance a
New opportunity to get the love you're wishin' for
To kick the door in to look for your ambitions, what?
You can move on out to elevate your existence up

Today

I'm just today, I'm just the way I am
I am ever single day I am
I'm February, April, March and even May I am
I'm only what you make me hope I'm what you pray I am
Today I am, I'm never really far away I am
You better scope me like the hunter does the prey I am
You play "I am" out in the picture yes today I am
I'm everything your memories say I am

Today
So seize me, I'm here to serve you if you serve me back
It's easy, but difficult that's time alone will squeeze me
From beaming your feet when all your actions turn to banking
An inkling, a hint, I'm moving faster than you're blinking
So treat me
To just a slice of heaven why you cheat me?
Deceive me and now I'm hell
Inside these thoughts that link me
To flesh the soul it's bound to I was truly made to be free

Today

Instead I'm going nowhere fast

I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent

I'm only saying this to show how all around
Man or beast sleep away their gift of time
And never know the beauty of a good life below

I'm bout to change the way I'm livin' homey (tomorrow)
I'm eatin' vegan, no ham or bologna (tomorrow)
I'm startin' off my day with yoga stretches (tomorrow)
I'm bout to master self to study lessons (tomorrow)
I'm swearin' off the weed and alcohol (tomorrow)
I won't be affected by doubts at all (tomorrow)
The sky's the limit, watch I'm bout to ball (tomorrow)

I'm spendin every single dollar wisely (tomorrow)
I'm writin songs that's bumpin like the Isleys (tomorrow)
I'll have the answers you can all confide in me (tomorrow)
Nothin the day could bring that will surprise me (tomorrow)
I'm buildin to the fullest every minute (tomorrow)
I'm through talkin the talk, I'm bout to live it (tomorrow)
Ain't even started yet, I'm at the finish line (tomorrow)

Man I can't wait until it's here I'm sayin (tomorrow)
Oh what, you hatin'? What, you think I'm playin? (tomorrow)
You think I ain't just go ahead and watch me (tomorrow)
I'll use the lessons yesterday has taught me (tomorrow)
I'm countin hours, minutes even seconds (tomorrow)
Man I can't even sleep, I'll build my Heaven (tomorrow)
Oh what, it here? Oh, oh what, it's what? (tomorrow)
Don't even trip, just give me one more day (tomorrow)
It's really gonna be on tomorrow (tomorrow)

I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent

Your stuck in a flurry of illusions goin' nowhere fast
Your stuck in a flurry of illusions goin' nowhere fast
Your stuck in a flurry of illusions goin' nowhere fast

There we are, all finished
And you don't know how much I appreciate your pardonEmbed
