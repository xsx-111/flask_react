Blazing Arrow Lyrics
Amazing phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow
The rays that range from Asia way to Rio De Janeiro
A craze you crave? But work today's the day that in a major way
I'll make you say "oh look, he saved the day and also paved the way" (hooray!)
Rocking my crew like razor blades today and days away
From now okay, okay, I'm like a laser ray keeping the stage ablaze
And dangerous ways rapping the phrase that pays all things just ain't a phase
But ageless ways a cagey great displays yo hey, this ain't a game
So stays awake 'cause if you came to play you'll all behave insane
After we change the game it won't remain the same (I'll fade away!)
So make your disc and play this tape in your Camaro
Amazing phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow

Me and my arrow
Straighter than narrow
Me and my arrow
Taking the high road
Me and my arrow
Straighter than narrow
Me and my arrow
Taking the high road

The verbal dart, I throw a murder all my foe and kill 'em
But learning all and so I'm growing while I'm learning with 'em
Inferno, I'll explode returning out the globe about to blow
Now get up out your seat, head on out the zones that I patrol
Rock and roll might tear you out the soul like blunts and alcohol
I knock your whole toboggan for a loop and now the doubt will flow
I'm not the pro you wanna knock cause on the real I got the glow
Cosmic flows as I suppose that's how it's supposed to be and got to go!
How'd ya know? Intuition I was on the old safe surface
Figure out your purpose? That's impossible!
But logic will disturb the thought or focus what it's not is all about
The grow about the kind of onus only God can know
I rock it for the chocolate, for the awkward, for the thoughtless
In your home or at your office, I'm your early morning coffee sip
Who got the ball? We roll with Navajos with double barrels
Amazing phase your days your hazy ways my Blazing Arrow
Me and my arrow
Straighter than narrow
(And you don't stop)
Me and my arrow
Taking the high road
Me and my arrow
Straighter than narrow
Me and my arrow
Taking the high road5Embed
