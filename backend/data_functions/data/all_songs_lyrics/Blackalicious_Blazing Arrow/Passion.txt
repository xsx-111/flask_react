Passion Lyrics
An open microphone can be dangerous
Let's tune in on two of the greatest
MCs out there

Passion, the will to win, the spark within
Passion, the strength within the hearts of men
Passion, the drive to press, to strive for best
To rise you've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion, to play through pain and love the game
Passion, to break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion, the fight for rights, to love your life
To rise you've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

Propaganda, positive propositions
A, politician, musician and a triple optician
Still, part of my mission's to slaughter the opposition
Critics that don't get it, I tell 'em to stop bitchin'
I do without plaques, I've done it without cash
Strictly for the love of the art - that's passion
Flashin', rappin' or jammin' or soundblastin'
When Quannum meets Expansion, this is what happens
Runnin' through the jungle with a flare gun
Arrow-arms, zoning out my mind
Like I was hooked on hero-in
Take the fire, turn it up and blaze whole forest down
Pullin from within' the inner insane warrior
California to the District of Columbia
Hella high octane, lookin' through a lazy eye
All ablaze, fire, flames, lightin' up the sky
Run into the burnin' sun, yellin'
Ride, nigga, ride, nigga, ride

Passion, the will to win, the spark within
Passion, the strength within the hearts of men
Passion, the drive to press, to strive for best
To rise you've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion, to play through pain and love the game
Passion, to break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion, the fight for rights, to love your life
To rise you've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

Desire, the fire that inspires
I don't state facts, I state buildings, like empires
Passion, he journey, the learnin', the time-turnin'
The searchin', the mind yearnin' to wake and find morning
Passion, the ladies they love the long-lasting
Asking for action? Brace for satisfaction
Passion, he black-skinned African jazz-men of the half in Aspen
Relaxed, gettin' my back rubbed
I'm still here, I've seen cats get killed here
I've seen cats make a mil but millionaires still fear
You can buy air play but you can't buy cheers
Blackalicious, Dilated, vibratin' your ears
Sent vibrations for years, I've been waiting for years
I've been patient for years, we ain't playin' this year
We hold stake in this here, it ain't safe for this year
We in the zone watch next level, takin' it there, this is
Passion, the will to win, the spark within
Passion, the strength within the hearts of men
Passion, the drive to press, to strive for best
To rise you've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion, to play through pain and love the game
Passion, to break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion, the fight for rights, to love your life
To rise you've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

Babu!
Let's listen to this recipe for-
Chief Xcel-
The most astonishing-
Soul-
New seeds of wisdom, craft, and skill
(Check it out, y'all)
Listen now, to this classic moment from-
DJ's, around the world, DJ's around the world

Had a rough weekend, got beat by passion
Saddled up, tweaked off a beat, started mashin'
Matador reek of the heat from the heater
Inner world dwellin', hear the world yellin' for a leader
I don't bother with the dealers, I take it to the lab
It's Rakaa chillin' with Babs, Xcel, Gift of Gab
I grab mics and fans gravitate, I can't waste it
My whole life, I wanted it so bad, I could taste it

Passion, the will to win, the spark within
Passion, the strength within the hearts of men
Passion, the drive to press, to strive for best
To rise you've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion, to play through pain and love the game
Passion, to break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion, the fight for rights, to love your life
To rise you've just arrived the quest is driven through
