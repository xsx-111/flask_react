Brain Washers Lyrics
Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
(Where do I go?)
Tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?

Walk, to a time when minds was one
Came into creation as itself, mankind was born
Step into the eye of the storm, survive as pawn
Casualties of evil men, slidin' the blinders on
Lies will spawn, hey are you conscious what side you're on?
Is the total story told or is it they hide you from?
Why are we on the brink of murderin' more innocent
Now it's like, we're patriotic and so militant
Get ya ride on, rise on, take a look
They done even takin' righteous laws, rewrote the books
To benefit the prize they got they eyes on
Minds run rampant, truth to be revealed when the proper time comes
Brainwashers

Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
(Where do I go?)
Tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?
Brainwashers
It's when you think how they wanna think
Speak how they wanna speak, Livin' in defeat
When you don't wanna question what they teach, as the truth
With no proof, with the fear of burnin' in eternal heat
When you're programmed not to be your own man, but a sheep
Bein' herded as they word it, so your thinkin' ain't free
When you sleep in a deep sleep standin' on your feet
When youâ€™re beat, makin' ends meet, while they in they seat
Now you're labeled obsolete, workin' for elite beasts
In the heat on bare feet, smile showin' off your teeth
Good grief, it's berserk how they work it
And they jerk it while they serve us
The surface keep the circus underneath the brainwashers

Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
(Where do I go?)
Tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?

Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
(Where do I go?)
Tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?
Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
(Where do I go?)
Tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?
Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
(Where do I go?)
Tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?
Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
(Where do I go?)
Tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?Embed
