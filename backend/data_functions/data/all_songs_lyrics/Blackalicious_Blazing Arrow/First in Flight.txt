First in Flight Lyrics
First in flight
First in flight
First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky

Free! Like a bird out in the wind in the night
Like a 747 to LA that's in flight
Free! Like a garden flourishing in the wind
Like a student bout to do it when he's graduatin'
Free! From any of the energy perception
Can never be defined create the definition within
Free! Just lovin' life itself and never pretend to be
Anything other than the man I was meant to be
Travel through time and get a glimpse of the centuries
To come a better day is promised remember
Free, like my nephew in a few months about to be out the penitentiary
Meditation, meditation, meditation
Meditation, meditation, meditation
Meditation, meditation, meditation

First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky
First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky
Uh! I never hesitate about a reluctant mind
Just put the pedal to the metal see what ya find
You back there slouchin' over, won't you pick up your spine?
Let's make it really really happen live up this time
Cause you can choose to say "Good morning, God" or "Good God, morning" (Good morning!)
With black clouds storming (Good morning!)
I walk without umbrellas into these woods
Don't need 'em cause the mighty trees above will shelter me good
I'm eating berries from the bushes of the heavenly good
From the states the power came to us whenever we stood
Reverberatin' out, a-reachin' each and every hood
Whenever we could the spiritual anatomy fool
But never take the credit for it B cause that'd be rude
It's just the way in life we searchin for that had to be new
You gotta work it though cause everyday ain't Saturday fool
Evolve into a better life and be happy with you and you'll be

First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky
First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky
The first to fly
The first to strive
The first to fight to stay alive
The first to win
The first to strike
The first to live
The first in flight

Rise! Like the sun up at the crack of the dawn
Like a wakin child in the mornin stretchin and yawnin
Rise! Like an infant being held in the light
Like the smoke from an incense when it's ignited
Rise! If you're sleepin won't you open your eyes again
The greatest high be that natural high within
No need to force in the progression just ride the wind
You'll know the answer to the where and the why and when
If you keep workin for your search you will find the end
Though at the end you'll find it only begins again
See at the end you see it only begins again
And everything you learn you're only rememberin
Cause you're

First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky
First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky
First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky
First in flight
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky
It's me
Let your mind and your soul be free
Work to shine meet your goal believe
Spread that kind of L-O-V-E
Take some time off the lonely
It's me
Let your mind and your soul be free
Work to shine meet your goal believe
Spread that kind of L-O-V-E
Take some time off the lonely

Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
We go beyond the edge of the sky
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
We go beyond the edge of the sky
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
We go beyond the edge of the sky
Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
We go beyond the edge of the sky2Embed
