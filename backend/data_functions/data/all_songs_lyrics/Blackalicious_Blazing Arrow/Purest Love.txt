Purest Love Lyrics
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing

Was born in a small town called Pacoima, California
Where them gangsters bang ghetto life thuggin' on the corner
Youngest child of six when I came pops split with momma
Used to visit on weekends 'til he moved to the north side of Cali
Fourteen he died, fifteen my moms died
Alcoholic diabetic forces were my life too
Moved with my older brother taught me discipline
But I wasn't ready though still shocked and holding pain in
So I skipped school got F's got the posters on my wall
Taken down, no TV, times I felt like ya'll ain't want me around
Set up in my room developing the mind of a loner
Writin' rhymes rappin' out my days instead of homework
Through it all my three sisters placed the place like one time
As I was like this rap thing is gonna pay, I know that I was right
But still set in my ways livin' for better days
Until I die I'm startin', if I'm broke or with that cheddar check

One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
Purest purest
Purest purest
Purest purest purest purest!
Love

The two realest cats I know? My two older brothers
The most beautiful woman in the galaxy? My mother
The strongest black women raising kids alone? My sisters
The best part of my future is my present love interest
The most important time? Right now and ever after
The greatest expression is love, happiness, and laughter
See life is a book and this song is just another chapter
I'll stay down to earth and real if you speak I'll speak back
I'm not a preacher or a scholar I'm merely just a rapper
I probably don't fit in to the current state of what you consider that to be
So you ask how can I rap
If I ain't thugged out, pimpin', flossin' my ice, packin' a gat?
Man if this is what I got I want dough I can't lie
But never sell my soul And front inside of mainstream's eyes
The purest love is how I'm driven, sent, and reach for my goals
If nothing else I'll leave the world some songs that speak from the soul

One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thingEmbed
