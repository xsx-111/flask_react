Chemical Calisthenics Lyrics
Ha ha ha good
Can you say it faster?

I can do anything, I can do anything

Neutron, proton, mass effect, lyrical oxidation, you're irrelevant
Mass spectrograph, your electronvolt, atomic energy erupting
As I get all open on betatrons, gamma rays thermo cracking
Cyclotron any and every mic you're on
Trans iridium, if you're always uranium
Molecules, spontaneous combustion, pow
Law of definite proportion, gaining weight
I'm every element around
Lead, gold, tin, iron, platinum, zinc, when I rap you think
Iodine nitrate activate
Like Germanium, the only difference is I transmit sound
Balance was unbalanced then you add a little talent in
Careful, careful with those ingredients
They could explode and blow up if you drop them
And they hit the ground
Let it blow, yo, just let it go, get back

Ca(OH)₂ wine water solution of calcium hydroxide
Slobbin' it, CaO lime will make bleach powder
Galvanic metal beats stomp out louder
Dried ice, CO squared refrigerant
NO₂ makes you laugh, it's laughing gas used by dentists
I'm muriatic acid glue, I'm like oil vitriol, the king of chemicals
Energy heat gas waved all your mats
Chemical change, ice point, melt all your raps
Atomic weight, hold shocks, when I call you last
Refillable gas keep going way beyond biatch
I'm only ill with buzzin', feel the ambiance
Adiabatic process oughta calm your ass
After I warm your ass, I'll give sodium silicate NO₂S₁O₃, a water glass
Borax flexure full of brimstone sulfur
Boracic acid, hip-hop preserver
CO₂ could never put away the fire
Style aromas is scientific; the lyrical fuse would be connected
To teach you chemical calisthenics

C4-4-4-4-4

Shootin' the gift
Shootin' the, gift
Shootin' the gift of guh-guh-gab
The theory is that all matter is composed of at least three fundamental particles
Protons, electrons, neutrons, protons are charged positive
By now you've guessed electrons are probably negatively charged
Neutrons don't follow either, neutral, in the middle, only no apologies
Centered, unmoved by yin and yang ideology
Neutron, bomb songs, electron fury
Cosmic musical radioactivity
Different points in joints within infinity
Oxygen and hydrogen alive within all types of energy
Within all types of energy
Within all types of energy
Within all types of energy
Within all types of energy, inside a world, inside a world
Inside a universe, inside of me existing although I can't see it
Hydrocarbon, nitrogen cycle, ionization
Heavier than electric motor metals that weigh over a ton
This has been a Chemist, Blackalicious creation
Clean out your desk, put your papers away 'cause class is almost done

All aboard for the night train

This is chemistry plus calisthenics
I'm calcium plus potassium, magnesium, newspaper of sodium, sulfate
Your solvent, chloroform, remedy from the norm
Glycerin, purest form Titanium
There is no way out, when this newfy is out
Of all arms vibration, forming in a nigga
Some bleachin' to teach ya religious is equal to pieces of meteor
Eager to be here or is it, can see here I know all of all
I'ma pickin' up pretty little Cindy
I'm more, I'm thinkin' of more
I'm cookin' a potion!
Yeah!6Embed
