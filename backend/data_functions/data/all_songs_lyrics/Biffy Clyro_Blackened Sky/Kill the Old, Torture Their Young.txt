Kill the Old, Torture Their Young LyricsThis will kill
Open your head, turn your back away, from me
Sensations, collapse under broken hearts
When time's like just when you fall asleep
And I thought to lose my way and glimmer and die
That's just what I thought today
And I thought to lose my way and suffer and die
That's just what I thought today
Where now
I'll get back, I'll get back
Where now
I'll get back, I'll get back
Something's wrong with us'
(Where now
I'll get back, I'll get back)
I'll get back'Embed
