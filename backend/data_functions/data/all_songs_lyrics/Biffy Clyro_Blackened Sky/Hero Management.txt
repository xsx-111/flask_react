Hero Management LyricsIron man, I return to you, to be the way you wanted
But I have no strength or the decency in me to be a hero
But we still fall down, yeah you still fall down
Iron man, I refuse to be the way that you would want me
Still I've got no strength but the sense in me to see I'm not a hero
But we still fall down, still fall down
And we'll still fall down, and we still fall
But we still fall down
And we still fall down
And you still fall down
Yeah we still fall down
I love you (take it away)
I love you (take it away)
I love you (take it away)
I love you (take it)Embed
