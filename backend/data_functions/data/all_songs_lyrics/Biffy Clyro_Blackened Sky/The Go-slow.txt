The Go-slow LyricsRemember when the insects fed off all our moments
You can't deny, the structures failed us in the go-slow
Love with them would kill her now
Catch me I'm falling down
Love with them would kill her now
Decrease the movements
Would you?
Switch transition, switch transition
Decrease the movement
Love me 'til I die
I don't expect much
Remember the time we lost ourselves to being lonely
Without love we sing and dance and kill together
Love with them would kill her now
Catch me I'm falling down
Love with them would kill her now
Decrease the movements
Would you?
Switch transition, switch transition
Decrease the movement
Love me 'til I die
I don't expect much
Catch me I'm falling down
Catch me I'm falling down
Catch me I'm falling down
Catch me I'm falling
The go-slow
The go-slow
The go-slowEmbed
