Joy.Discovery.Invention Lyrics
Look at slow motion, asleep at the door
Next to destruction, reach for the sores

Get up, get up, get over
Take me to your blackened sky
Get up, get up, get over
Take me to your blackened sky

Sink with your wasted dreams when you can
Find time to console them, become what I am
If you submit to all the hopes you've made
Down, through your heart

Get up, get up, get over
Take me to your blackened sky
Get up, get up, get over
Take me to your blackened sky

Passed away, I hope you don't mind
What's a little sin to see us through?
If you want it, get it, go and break my heart
Take me to your blackened sky
If you want it, get it, go and break my heart
Take me to your blackened sky

Passed away, I hope you don't mind
What's a little sin to see us through?
If you wanna get it, come and break my heart
Take me to your blackened skyEmbed
