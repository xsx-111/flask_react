57 LyricsThe sun shone in
The glint in your eye
Your beautiful face
Your beautiful face
I held her tight
Close to my heart
I didn't know it would break
I didn't know it would break
I don't believe there's a love anymore
It's all inside
We always said it's forever in
This beautiful life
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do
And I'm trying not to feel this music's for you...
And over HEY
And over HEY
And over HEY
And I'm trying not to feel this music's for you...
And over HEY
And over HEY
And over HEY
I held her tight
Close to my heart
I didn't know it would break
I didn't know it would break
I don't believe there's a love anymore
It's all inside
We always said its forever in
This beautiful life
And I'm trying not to feel this music's for you
And over HEY
And over HEY
And over HEY
And I'm trying not to feel this music's for you
And over HEY
And over HEY
And over HEY
And over HEY
And over HEY
And over HEY..
Its alright
Its alright
Its alright
Its alrightEmbed
