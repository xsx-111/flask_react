Justboy LyricsEvery once in a while I see your face
I'm feeling half the man
Then you cup your hands you throw me away
I'm under
But then everything beneath me fails
I'm feeling half the man
Then you shut your eyes, you close me away
I'm under
I'm alone with these thoughts of mine
People look and tell me "justboy"
"I don't believe in anything"
That's the message in your eyes (in your eyes)
"I don't believe in anything"
That's the message in your eyes
I have tried so hard to leave this place
It leaves me underhand
I want to feel your breath here with me and kiss you
I'm alone with these thoughts of mine
People look and tell me "justboy"
"I don't believe in anything"
That's the message in your eyes (In your eyes)
"I don't believe in anything"
That's the message in your eyes
I am
Hoping
Through the
Dark clouds
Light shall break and bring a bright sky
I am
Hoping
Through the
Dark clouds
Light shall break and bring a bright sky
I am
Hoping
Through the
Dark clouds
Light shall break and bring a bright sky
Light shall break and bring a bright skyEmbed
