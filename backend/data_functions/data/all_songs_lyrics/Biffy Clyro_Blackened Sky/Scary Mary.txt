Scary Mary LyricsWhat must I have become to deserve all the shit that you gave me?
The rocks look like a body in the river, now I just wish that I could sleep
To keep me from thinking, but the thoughts keep me up
It's been two months since you taught me not to trust
But you kept your promise
You made patterns on my face, you painted pictures with my tears
And you did it again, I knew that you would
Thank you for showing me there's more
Wash off your hands, it's time to let go, release them
Give time to your heart, give time to your soul, release them allEmbed
