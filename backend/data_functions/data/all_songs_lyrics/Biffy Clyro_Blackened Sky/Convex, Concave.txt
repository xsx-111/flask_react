Convex, Concave LyricsSix more times slide in your eye
You think you're innocent, innocent
Pull back and assess the skinned sky
To see your innocence, innocence
Use just once and destroy
Searching for answers, you'll never employ
Complete become your vision now
It's the same as I am
It's just true incest now
Deceive your sins again you're innocent
Reflect the hate in your eyes
Convex you're down, concave you're in again
Use just once and destroy
Searching for answers, you never employ
Complete become your vision now
It's the same as I am
Just to see this love plan!
Hit reset, reset
Time and time again
Hit reset, reset
Time and time again
Sweat drenched hands, is it blood, fuck who cares?
I cannot help the joy I'm feeling
Hurting you, you're beautiful when you cry
If you love...
You'd understand the way
Clever thoughts withstand
And sway against your pain
I can't give nothing your way
To believe in, to believe in
Your heart
I'm sorry for this now but I have to hurt, I have to kill youEmbed
