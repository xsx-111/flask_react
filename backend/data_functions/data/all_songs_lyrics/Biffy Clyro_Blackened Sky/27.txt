27 LyricsI stroke your silken skin, kiss you goodbye
Your eyes just pierce me through
I am bleeding with blood I'd give to you to be the way we were
I still feel the pain in my head
Thoughts once pure are now diluted
We sat and watched the sun go down
We're wrapped together in each others' arms
I never felt so complete as when we're alone
On the sand that night
I still feel the pain in my heart
Thoughts once pure are now diluted
I love the way your hair hangs over your eyes
Crush me with your stare
If I could fly to you I would to be the way we were
I still feel the pain in my heart
Thoughts once pure are now diluted
It's alright now
It's alright now
It's alright now
It's alright now2Embed
