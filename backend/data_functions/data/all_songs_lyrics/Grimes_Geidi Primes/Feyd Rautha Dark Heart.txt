Feyd Rautha Dark Heart Lyrics
I won't break your heart in the dark, in the
I won't break your heart in the dark, in the
I won't break your, I won't break your
I won't break your heart in the dark

On a window, I see a plane
How to know, it's in the sky
Where it flies
On a tower, I see a cloud
How to know that it floats
In the sky

I won't break your, I won't break your
I won't break your heart in the dark
I won't break your, I won't break your
I won't break your heart in the dark

On a sheet, I see a flower
How to know, that it's sewn in the cloud
On the wall, there's skies and water
How to know that it flows
Only in the land
I won't break your, I won't break your (Heart, in the dark, in the)
I won't break your heart in the dark, in the
I won't break your, I won't break your (Heart, in the dark, in the)
I won't break your heart in the dark
I won't break your, I won't break your
I won't break your heart in the dark
I won't break your, I won't break your
I won't break your heart in the dark
I won't break your, I won't break your
I won't break your heart in the dark
I won't break your, I won't break your
I won't break your heart in the dark2Embed
