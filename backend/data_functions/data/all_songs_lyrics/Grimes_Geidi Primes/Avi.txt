Avi Lyrics
Every single heart I've touched
Has swiftly turned to gold
But I don't need that fact to know
From the risk of getting old

Oh, I won't take your breath away
Your lungs are too far from my cold fingers
Oh, I won't take your breath away
So you don't have to stay
I won't take your breath away
Even now I guess I'm loving you forever
I won't take your breath away
Silence that is ours and we'll use it tonight

I don't wanna say
I don't wanna do anything about this
Or about you
I don't wanna say
I don't wanna do anything about this
Or about you

Every single word I say
Has my passion with
Every man I hope to find
Gets wider in the way
But I won't take your breath away
You have nothing to fear cause we're better than fear
Oh I won't take your breath away
So you have me together
I won't take your breath away
Oh na na na na na na oh
(Even now I guess I'm loving you forever)
I won't take your breath away
Oh na na na na na na oh
(Silence that is ours and we'll use it tonight)

I don't wanna say
I don't wanna do anything about this or about you
I don't wanna say
I don't wanna do anything about this or about you
I don't wanna say
I don't wanna do anything about this or about you
I don't wanna say
I don't wanna do anything about this or about you5Embed
