Rosa Lyrics
Midnight, afternoon
Morning comes, but not too soon
Rosa wakes up in my bed
We are separate
Vampires in our nights aware
Iâ€™m no longer happy in there

Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Oh, where is my heart?
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Where is my heart?
I can never tell her
That she is a witch
Sewing up my heart
Get love in equal stitch

Oh, I am not in love
I am not in love
I'm not
Oh, I am not in love
I am not in love
I'm not
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Where is my heart?
Rosa, Rosa, Rosa
Where are my arms?
Morning, morning, morning
Will wake me up cold
Morning, morning, morning
Reminds me that I am getting old, oh10Embed
