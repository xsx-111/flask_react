Caladan Lyrics
We all haunt in the sky at night
We all haunt in the sky at night

Under a sea of clouds I fight
For the win, my love, as she tumbles
Something fell from the blue-white snow
Bright light grew and string my bow
The wind shall seek with the sailor and me
It's the charming love if I saw one

We all haunt in the sky at night
We all haunt in the sky at night

Under a sea of clouds I fight
For the win, my love, as she tumbles2Embed
