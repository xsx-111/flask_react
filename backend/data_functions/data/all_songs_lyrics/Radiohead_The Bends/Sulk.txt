Sulk Lyrics
You bite through the big wall
The big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk
You sit there and bawl
You look so pretty
When you're on your knees
Disinfected
And eager to please

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Each time it comes
It eats me alive
I try to behave
But it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away

Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but we're already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change9Embed
