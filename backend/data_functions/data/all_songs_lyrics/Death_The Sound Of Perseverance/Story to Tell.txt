Story to Tell Lyrics
Drifting into the lives
Seep into the soul
Where emotions hide

Dark skies were beating me down
With shadows of deceit
Slashing at trust 'til it forever bleeds
With doubt (with doubt)
With pain (with pain)
With trust is pain

When you think of me
In your multi-dimensional mind
Try and wash the evil from your mind
And open it

When you taste the truth
You will see like others before me
To you I am past, a story to tell
To you I am past, a story to tell
Tell it!
If you think you own the end
Take another look at the script
Of sadness etched in the book

Dark skies were beating me down
With shadows of deceit
Slashing at trust 'til it forever bleeds
With doubt (with doubt)
With pain (with pain)
With trust is pain

When you think of me
In your multi-dimensional mind
Try and wash the evil from your mind
And open it

When you taste the truth
You will see like others before me
To you I am past, a story to tell
To you I am past, a story to tell
Tell it!1Embed
