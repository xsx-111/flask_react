Flesh and the Power It Holds Lyrics

I told you once but I will say it again
When you live the flesh, it is the beginning of the end

It will take you in, it will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds

Passion is a poison laced with pleasure bitter-sweet
One of many faces that hide deep beneath

It will take you in and it will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds

Touch, taste, breathe, consumed

Deja-vu, already knew from the first encounter
But now I know to let go of words to speak no more
Like a wind upon your face you can't see it but you know it's there
When beauty shows its ugly face just be prepared

Passion burns like fire carried by the wind
The end of a time, a time to begin

It will take you in, it will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds

It builds you up one way, and tears you right back down
A time to begin, the end of a time

It will take you in, it will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds

Touch, taste, breathe, consumed

Deja-vu, already knew from the first encounter
But now I know to let go of words to speak no more
Like a wind upon your face you can't see it but you know it's there
When beauty shows its ugly face just be prepared8Embed
