A Moment of Clarity Lyrics
I would describe it as an invisible darkness
Casting a shadow, a blinding black
Guarded by hope, my soul is kept safe
From the bloody claws

Look to beyond
What vision lets me see
Time after time
Unneeded misery

My dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight
And hope for sight

Open my eyes wide to see
A moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask why

Life is like a mystery
With many clues, but with few answers
To tell us what it is that we can do to look
For messages that keep us from the truth
Look to beyond
What vision lets me see
Time after time
Unneeded misery

My dreams
I own no price for you
I grip them tight
And hope for sight

Open my eyes wide to see
A moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask why
Oh God, why?Embed
