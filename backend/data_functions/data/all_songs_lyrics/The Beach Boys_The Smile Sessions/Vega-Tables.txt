Vega-Tables Lyrics
I'm gonna be round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table

If you brought a big, brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot

I'm gonna keep well my vegetables
Cart off and sell my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favorite vega-table

I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I'm so embarrassed

(Mom and daddy says)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
(Wordless vocals and sound effects)

I threw away my candy bar and I ate the wrapper
And when they told me what I did I burst into laughter

(Mom and daddy says)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)

I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vega-table
I know that you'll feel better
When you send us in your letter an'
Tell us the name of your
Your favorite vega-table
