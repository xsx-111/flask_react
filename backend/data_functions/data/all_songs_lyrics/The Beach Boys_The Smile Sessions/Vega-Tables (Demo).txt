Vega-Tables (Demo) LyricsI'm gonna be 'round my vegetables
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables
I love you most of all
My favor-ripe Vega-Table
(Run 'em all around, dig a hole in the ground)
If you brought a big, brown bag of them home
I'd jump up and down and hope you'd toss me a carrot
Tripped on a cornucopia
Stripped a stalk green and I hope ya
Like me the most of all
My favor-ripe Vega-Table
(All those buttons flew off of my shirt)
I tried to kick the ball but my tennie flew right off
I'm red as a beet 'cause I got so flusteredEmbed
