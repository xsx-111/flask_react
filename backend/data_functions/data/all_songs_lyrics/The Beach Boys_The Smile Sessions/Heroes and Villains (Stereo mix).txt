Heroes and Villains (Stereo mix) LyricsI've been in this town so long that back in the city I've been taken for a lost and gone an unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the Spanish and Indian ho-home of the Heroes and Villains
Once at night, cotillion squared the fight and she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of Heroes and....

Done...
Heroes and Villains, just see what you've done-
Done...
Stand or fall I know there shall be peace in the valley and it's all an affair of my life with the Heroes and Villains
In the Cantina, Margarita's keep the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and wound in the warmth
Her body fanned the flame of the dance-
Dance, Margarita! Don't you know that I love with you?
Dance...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!!!
My Children were raised, you know they suddenly rise, they started slow long ago, head-to-toe; healthy, wealthy and wise
I've been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff, to ride in the rough
And sunny-down snuff I'm alright
By the Heroes and-
Heroes and Villains, just see what you've done-
Done...
Heroes and Villains, just see what you've done-
Done...Embed
