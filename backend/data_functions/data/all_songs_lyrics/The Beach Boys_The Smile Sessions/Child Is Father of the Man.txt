Child Is Father of the Man Lyrics


(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
Father of the man (Father of the man, father of the man)

Father of the man (Father of the man, father of the man)
(Child, child, child, the child, the child)

Easy, my child, it's just enough to believe
(I believe, I believe, I believe)
Out of the wild into what you can't conceive
You'll achieve

(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
Father of the man (Father of the man, father of the man)
(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
Father of the man (Father of the man, father of the man)
(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
Father of the man (Father of the man, father of the man)
(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
Father of the man (Father of the man)
