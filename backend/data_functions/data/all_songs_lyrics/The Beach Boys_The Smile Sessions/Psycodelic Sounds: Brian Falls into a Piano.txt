Psycodelic Sounds: Brian Falls into a Piano LyricsBrian:
Well...look, I'll see you guys later.
David:
Where'd he go? He went in the piano. He's disappeared right into the piano.
Michael:
Hey, Brian? Brian? Brian, where are ya?
Brian:
I'm in the piano.
Michael:
Come outta there, man!
Brian:
I can't! I'm stuck between the C and the C#.
Michael:
Well, try to get out!
Brian:
I did, but I hit my head on the mallet.
Michael:
Let's see, how we gonna get him out, David?
David:
I don't know.
Brian:
It's freezin' in here.
David:
Let's see if we can play him out...
Brian:
It's really cool- NO! Don't hit the C#! Oh!
Michael:
Oh, I'm sorry!
Brian:
Ow! Careful, man.
Michael:
There?
Brian:
Oh! Oooh. No. Yow!
Michael:
Aw, there he is! Now listen: I'll hit it with the mallet and you grab the mallet as it goes up and it'll lift you outta there.
Brian:
Alright. Go slow because I'm on, uh...
Michael:
Here we go...
Brian:
All right.
Michael:
Just a little at a time...
Brian:
Alright, hit it! Ow! There, I'm on!
Michael:
Alright! Now one more time and boost yourself all the way out.
Brian:
Wait a minute! Strike the Bb.
Michael:
The Bb?
Brian:
Yeah! My left foot's on it. Oh, there I am! Ah, okay, I'm on top the C#. Now hit the C# real hard and I'll come flyin' out. How are ya?
Van:
Hey! We're glad to see ya.
Michael:
Hey, that was great!
David:
Glad to have ya back.
Brian:
Weird thing to happen. Weirdest thing that's ever happened to me out there.
Van:
What a thing, tappin'!!
Brian:
Danny! What's happening? Where'd Danny come from? Suddenly showed up.
Van:
I wanna be 'round my vegetables.Embed
