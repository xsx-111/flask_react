Our Prayer (Session) LyricsBrian:
Ahhh-Ah-oooo.
Jim:
Take your time, Brian.
Mike:
Listen girl, I said "I gotta go out, buy me some new shoes." I told her, European too, "I have to run around with rags on my feet". Hallelujah, you got some fine some rags on your feet. I mean, I told the man "Shit, I needs credit".
Brian:
Ah-ooo.
Dennis:
Oo-ooo.
Brian:
No, "Ah-oo".
Dennis:
Brian, it's "Oo-oo"!
Carl:
Oo-ooo. Is that the last chance you do it or the last note?
Dennis:
Brian it's, "Ooooo", it's not, "Ah-ooo". It's "oo-oo".
Al:
Right.
Brian:
Okay, "Oo-oo".
Carl:
Big deal.
Brian:
One, two, three...

Dennis:
Un-un.
Mike:
Wait a minute. Really.
Al:
I'm sorry, but I just...
Brian:
Let's do it again.
Carl:
Hey, the last two notes are "Oo-oo". You guys, no "ah". Okay, but not everybody's doing it. Not everybody's...
Bruce:
You putting a track in sync to this?
Brian:
Yeah.
Bruce:
Okay let's get the pitch really on it now.
Brian:
Okay, now watch the changes and the thing goes...
Carl:
I think you two better get in cause Dennis and I were really loud.

Bruce:
We're off.
Jim:
Try again.
Carl:
Try- Try not to make your voices so harsh but make 'em "ahhh". Make 'em like really, "aaahhhhh". They don't have to be, "ennnhh".
Brian:
Alright, get in. Move in, please. Come on, sing out now.
Bruce:
But don't block too much of that, otherwise you get a false...
Al:
Okay, great.
Brian:
One, two...

Carl:
Hey, this one will get it! This is...
Mike:
We should be doin' "Good Vibration" anyway.
Brian:
Let's get it. Let's go.
Bruce:
Would it be better if I didn't sing it and you just...?
Brian:
Come on! Let's just... Are you singing, Carl? Are you singing?
Mike:
Nobody's changing, or some shit.
Carl:
There were no changes.
Dennis:
You're the one who was changin', Mike. You and I. Because I changed and...
Bruce:
Getting better. It's cool but it's getting better.
Al:
Alright, 32.
Brian:
32.
Dennis:
32! We're almost up to Little Miss America.
Brian:
Hit the thing solid. Right on the note. Two, three...

Brian:
I rushed it. It's gettin' better. I don't understand the mo- the thing that's happening there.
Dennis:
Well... . Right?
Brian:
Yeah.
Mike:
Is that it?
Brian:
Yeah.
Mike:
Okay, then try again.
Brian:
One, two, three...

Brian:
I know what it is, we're not doin' it fast enough and we're not- it's not moving there.
Mike:
I'm hittin' the note.
Brian:
Something's not happening with it, though. Here we go. Two, three...

Brian:
Take it soft and build it. Here we go. One, two, three...

Brian:
One more time.
Mike:
Hey, wait a sec. Where is it from, my ending note?
Brian:
A whole octave, man.
Mike:
Yeah! That's what I figured.
Brian:
Hey, that's cool! Pick an octave. Here we go: One, two, three...

Carl:
I was bad.
Brian:
Carl, you're just gonna have to make that change.
Carl:
Alright, I can't do it. Okay, I'm doing it the wrong way. Got it.
Brian:
Two, three...

Al:
Which one is it? Alright.
Brian:
Yeah! I went like this: "wHOOAAAaa" and Al was running that way. Al was looking like this, ya know, waiting for the ball, and about 4 guys break his leg up. Isn't that how it went?
Al:
That's right Brian.
Brian:
Well, I- If you could've seen you, man! You just really...
Al:
Let's go! Hey, hey!
Mike:
Imagine??
Brian:
Come on, Jardine. Ah...two...

Mike:
Can you turn out these little light-os up here?
Carl:
Make it very dim in here. We can see what we're doing.
Mike:
Fanc√≠ luminato.
Al:
Can't even hear what we're doing in here.
Carl:
Those lights are the things that are...yeah...off with that one.
Al:
Ah! It's beautiful, Carl! Lets...give me the note, Brian.
Brian:
One, two...

Brian:
You're not building enough, Al.
Al:
It's not fast enough, Brian.
Carl:
First off, it's not fast enough.
Al:
It's draggy, man.
Carl:
It's not fast enough, Brian.
Brian:
Okay, move it a little faster. Okay let's take a breath now.
Jim:
Take 4. Part 4, take 3.
Brian:
Yeah, okay. Here we go. One, two...

Brian:
Why are we losin' our breath?
Al:
How can it be that long?
Jim:
Part 4, take 12.
Brian:
Okay, here we go, now. One, two...

Brian:
Excuse me.
Mike:
Try to do it again.
Carl:
I think we should all do them separate, I swear to God.
Mike:
Well, do it!
Al:
Let's do it with it!
Brian:
One more, please.
Al:
Watch his hand you guys.
Mike:
When we doin' "Wonderful"?
Brian:
Um...when you wanna do it?
Mike:
Tomorrow night?
Brian:
We don't have anything till Thursday and Friday.
Mike:
Oh. Okay.
Carl:
Why can't we do "Wonderful"?
Brian:
Not tonight. I'm glad we got this thing done. I really am. I would like everyone to sing out cause it's a big ending. Let's just do it fast and get it over with.
Al:
So should we outline?
Brian:
I don't think you're moving with my conduction.
Carl:
Are you looking at...?
Al:
Yes, I am.
