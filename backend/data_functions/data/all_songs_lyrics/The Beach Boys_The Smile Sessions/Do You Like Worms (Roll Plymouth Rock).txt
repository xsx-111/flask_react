Do You Like Worms (Roll Plymouth Rock) LyricsWavin' from the Ocean Liner
Beaded, cheering Indians behind them
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Bicycle Rider, just see what you've done-
Done to the church of the American Indian!
Once upon the Sandwich Isles
The social structure steamed upon Hawaii
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Bicycle Rider, just see what you've done-
Done to the church of the American Indian!
Mahala-lu-lei
Mahala-lu-la
Keeni-waka-pula
Rock, rock. Roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Having returned to the East or the West Indies...
We always got them confusedEmbed
