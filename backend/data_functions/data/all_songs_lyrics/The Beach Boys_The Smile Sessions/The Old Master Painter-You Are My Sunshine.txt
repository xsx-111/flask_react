The Old Master Painter/You Are My Sunshine Lyrics

The old master painter from the faraway hills
Painted the violets and the daffodils
He put the purple in the twilight haze
Then did a rainbow for the rainy days


You were my sunshine, my only sunshine
You made me happy when skies were grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I loved you
How could you take my sunshine away?

(Sunshine, my sunshine...)
My only sunshine
(Sunshine, my sunshine, sunshine...)
When skies were grey
(Sunshine, my sunshine, sunshine...)
How much I love you
(Sunshine, my sunshine, sunshine...)Embed
