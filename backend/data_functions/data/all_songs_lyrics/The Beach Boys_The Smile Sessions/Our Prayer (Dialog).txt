Our Prayer (Dialog) LyricsBrian:
We have to get it out
Mike:
Accomplished. The accomplishment of this...
Al:
This- this can be another...uh. This could be considered a track. Brian?
Brian:
Not really, though. We don't wanna do that
Al:
I think it's beautiful
Brian:
This is a little intro, ya know, to the album. Okay, this is "Intro to the Album: Take 1", and uh, we're gonna definitely need a C#
Al:
Brian, direct, okay?
Brian:
Alright. Let's try to really pull it off good now. Here we go. Three, four...

Brian:
Take it again. Once again. One minute, Mike. Not enough breath. Take it from the top of the second verse
Al:
And then what after that, Brian? What do we just do?
Brian:
And then it goes...
Al:
That's the end, right? Great. And then the hum
Brian:
Okay, take it from the top of the second verse where you go down and you can... Three, four...

Brian:
That one note has to be a little smoother comin' up, Mike. Deeper breaths, here we go. Is this opened all the way around, Jim? That's weird that we're not picking up Mike in it
Mike:
 This is now goin' all around. Shake it up, shake it up, so we'll hear the sound!
Jim Hockman:
Close?
Carl:
Yeah, very close
Brian:
Denny, do ya have any hash joints left? I know you do
Al:
Okay, move in
Brian:
Okay, three, four...

Brian:
Hey, what's the matter with the notes? A whole note up, Mike
Al:
What's the chord? What's the key?
Brian:
It's... What're you doin' on the bottom, Mike?
Mike:
Brian:
Here we go. Three, four...

Al:
Get right in there
Dennis:
You want all of us, now?
Al:
Get a balance
Brian:
You guys feel any acid yet?
Al:
I feel brand new
Mike:
Let's go
Brian:
Three, four...
