Heroes and Villains (Smile Sessions Version) Lyrics
I've been in this town so long that back in the city I've been taken for a lost and gone an unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the Spanish and Indian ho-home of the heroes and villains

Once at night, cotillion squared the fight and she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains

Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Done, done
Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Done, done

Stand or fall, I know there shall be peace in the valley
And it's all an affair of my life with the heroes and villains

In the cantina, Margarita's keep the spirit high
There I watched her, she spun around and wound in the warmth
Her body fanned the flame of the dance
Dance, Margarita, don't you know that I'm love with you?
Dance
"You're under arrest!"
My children were raised, you know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago, head-to-toe
Healthy, wealthy and wise

I've been in this town so long, so long to the city
I'm fit with the stuff to ride in the rough
And sunny-down snuff I'm alright
By the heroes and...

Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Done, done
Heroes and villains, just see what you've done
Done, done
