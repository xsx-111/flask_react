Look (Song for Children) Lyrics


(One)
Maybe not one (One, one, one, one)
Maybe you too (Wonderful)
A-wondering
Wondering who (One, one, one, one)
Wonderful you (Wonderful)
A-wondering

(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
Father of the sun
(Child, child, the child, the child)
(Instrumental)

Where is the father? (Father of the sun)
(Father of the child, where is the father, child, child, the child, the child)
When is the wonderful me? (Father of the child)
Wonderful you
Though I know, I know what you're wondering
Never mind wonderful you
I can stop and wondering
Never you mind, wonderful
(Instrumental)

(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
Father of the sun
(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
(Child, child, child, the child, the child)
Father of the sun
(Child, child, child, the child, the child)Embed
