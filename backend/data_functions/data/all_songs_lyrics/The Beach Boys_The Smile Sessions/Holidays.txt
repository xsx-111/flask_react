Holidays Lyrics


A pirate with a tune on a holiday
Ol' lazy Mr. Moon wanna getaway
And isn't that a moon for a milky way?
A ukelele lady around a lei

Rock, rock, roll (Child!)
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
For a holiday
With a roundelay

Abash and forth, a starboard corse
With north abeam; Sherrie, of course!
The men will share some sports a-now, me hearty
Not the rum of 'carib scum, it's port tonight, drink up and come!
Aweigh the anchor, Yank! And we will party...

A shanty town, a chanty in Waikiki
And juxtapose a man with a mystery
A blue Hawaiian captures his melody
And Liliuokalani will sing for me
Rock, rock, roll (Child!)
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
For a holiday

Long, long ago, long ago
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tinklin'
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tinklin'
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tinklin'Embed
