Have you seen the Grande Coolie?
Have you seen the Grande Coolie?
Have you seen the Grande Coolie workin' on the railroad?
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock, roll over
Rock, rock, roll Plymouth Rock, roll over

Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy (boy)
Day-ooh-la-wa
Day-ooh-la-wa
Row, row, row, row
