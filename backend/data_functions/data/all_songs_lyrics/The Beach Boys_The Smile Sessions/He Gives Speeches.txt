He Gives Speeches Lyrics
1, 2, 3...

He gives speeches but they put him back in bed where he wrote his satire
He gives speeches, always reaches out a lot, led him to discover
Silken hair, more silken hair fell on his face and no wind was blowin'
Stepped across the golden fields, and saw that she was soon trailing after
She was nice and didn't fight, he fell into her friendly persuasion
Late that night while by a streetlight, little hands shadowed on the ceiling

Brian: Should I overdub it?
This is gonna be so great, i'm not kiddingEmbed
