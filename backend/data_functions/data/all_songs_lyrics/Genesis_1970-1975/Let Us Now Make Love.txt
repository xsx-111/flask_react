Let Us Now Make Love LyricsPlease, I beg you, hear this humble voice
Please, pale orchid flower, music of my soul
Alone upon the windswept way
Descends the nightingale
She swoops to soothe my aching brow
Let us now make love
Please, I beg you, hear this humble voice
Please, my emerald goddess, wash away the wounds
Alone the pilgrim thirsts and falls
The Queen runs to his call
She stoops to soothe his aching brow
Let us now make love
Make love, make love
Let us, let us, let us make love
(Love, love)
Sweet heavenly love
(Love, love)
I promise you life will be good
(Love, love)
If you just step down and try
(Love, love)
To be one with, so feel pride
(Let us now make love)
Let us make love till the end of time
Now and forever
Please, I beg you, hear this humble voice
Please, dear oyster shell, reveal your hidden pearl
Alone the deaf, the sick, the blind
Turn grimly for the knife
The prophet stoops to soothe their brow
Let us now make love
Make love, make love
Let us, let us, let us make love
(Love, love)
Sweet heavenly love
(Love, love)
I promise you life will be good
(Love, love)
If you just step down and try
(Love, love)
To be one with, so feel pride
(Let us now make love)
Let us make love till the end of time
Now and forever
Please, I beg you, hear this humble voice
Come, let's walk the windy roads to find the truth
Revealed, each part has now been played
Your beauty will not fade
So cling to me, fulfill your vow
Let us now make love
(Love, love)
Sweet heavenly love
(Love, love)
I promise you life will be good
(Love, love)
If you just step down and try
(Love, love)
To be one with, so feel pride
(Let us now make love)
Let us make love till the end of time
Now and forever
Let us now make love
Till the end of timeEmbed
