Shepherd LyricsRise up! Take your lyre and sing
Listen to the news I bring
Frosty breath on the window
See a friend in the snow that gently falls
Feel the truth in those sad eyes
See the smile that's so rare
Just like the love she waits for
And she plays a game of her own
As she sleeps within the firelight
For her dreams are incredibly wild
But they're lost and gone forever with the dawn
Fair and friend of the fleece folk
Warrior bold, shepherd wise, fair prince of peace
Someone waits in the doorway
On a white horse he comes
And holds out the hand she waits for
So they ride through a valley of mist
To a castle in the heavens
Where he lays her down to rest
But he's lost and gone forever with the dawn
See her writhe in her dream, then...
Mermaids sing in the sunset
Sadly asking if beauty ever walks free
But Queen Frost only whispers
Maidens you will remain to be free
See her writhe in her dreams...
Lord of the Seven Suns!
Keeper of the Keys of Time!
Hear me!Embed
