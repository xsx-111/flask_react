Frustration LyricsLittle bit of flesh to dig my teeth in
You are the long-nosed queen
Floating up and down
Woman! body draped in wire
All you seem to do is swallow me
Get away!
I am the mad, mad scientist
Soon i'll build the perfect female friend
To comfort me, to satisfy
Programmed just to please
Anyway, you are the one for me
Switching on and off
Woman, body soft and warm
Stroking furry fingers on the micromesh
Follow me!
I am the mad, mad scientist
Who's power can turn medusa's head to stone
Destroy the blast, dangling from a chain
I say, 'what's the use'?Embed
