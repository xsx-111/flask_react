Harvester of Hearts LyricsIf a person should ever like a person
Then a person should like you
Being that I'm only just a person
What would you do?
If a person should ever like a person
Then a person should like me
Bein' that you're only just a person
It must be
Still I find it hard to get an answer
From the harvester of hearts
I always find it hard to get an answer
From the harvester of hearts
If a person should ever like a person
How funny that would be
If a person should ever like me
Not that I have that much to offer
God knows I have so much to gain
From the harvester of hearts
From the harvester of pain
If a person should ever like a person
Then a person should be free
Free to like whomever that they want to
Even though it ain't me
Not that I have that much to offer
God knows I have so much to gain
From the harvester of hearts
From the harvester of pain
That's all you're getting tonight
Heh heh heh heh hehEmbed
