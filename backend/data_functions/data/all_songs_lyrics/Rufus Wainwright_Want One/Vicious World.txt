Vicious World LyricsThought that maybe we'd fall in love over the phone
Thought that maybe I'd really love bein' alone
Everybody but Heaven knows how I was wrong
Oh Lord, what have I done to myself
What have I done to myself
In this vicious world
Such a vicious world
There isn't anything you can do
In this vicious world
Suckin' on the ice makin' eyes all by myself
Didn't realize you were so top of the shelf
Just you wait and see when you turn, turn 23
Oh Lord, what have I done to myself
What have I done to myself
In this vicious world
Such a vicious world
There isn't anything you can do
In this vicious world
Such a vicious world
There isn't anything you can do
In this vicious world
There isn't anything you can do
In this vicious worldEmbed
