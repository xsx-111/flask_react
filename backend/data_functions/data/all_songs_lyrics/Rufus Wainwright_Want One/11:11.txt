11:11 Lyrics
Woke up this mornin' at 11:11
Wasn't in Portland and I wasn't in heaven
Could have been either by the way I was feelin'
But I was alive
I was alive

Woke up this mornin' at 11:11
John was half-naked and Lulu was cryin'
Over a baby that will never go crazy
But I was alive

And kickin' through this cruel world
Holdin' a notion of you at 11:11
Tell me what else can I do
What else can I do?

Woke up this mornin' and somethin' was burnin'
Realized that everythin' really does happen in Manhattan
Thoughts were of characters and afternoons lyin'
And you
You were alive
Oh the hours we are separate
11:11 is just precious time we've wasted
So patch up your bleedin' hearts
And put away your posies
I'm gonna have a drink
Before we ring around the rosies with you

Oh the hours we are separate
Oh the hours we are separate
