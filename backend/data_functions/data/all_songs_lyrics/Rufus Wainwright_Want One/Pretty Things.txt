Pretty Things LyricsPretty things
So what if I like pretty things
Pretty lies
So what if I like pretty lies
From where you are
To where I am now
I need these pretty things
Around the planets of my face
Everything's a sign of my astrology
From where you are
To where I am now
Is its own galaxy
Be a star
And fall down somewhere next to me
And make it past your color TV
This time will pass and with it will me
And all these pretty things
Don't say you don't notice themEmbed
