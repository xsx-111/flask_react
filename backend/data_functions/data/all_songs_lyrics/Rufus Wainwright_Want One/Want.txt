Want Lyrics
I don't wanna make it rain
I just want to make it simple
I don't wanna see the light
I just want to see the flashlight

I don't wanna know the answers
To any of your questions
I don't want
No I really don't want
To be John Lennon or Leonard Cohen

I just wanna be my Dad
With a slight sprinkling of my mother
And work at the family store
And take orders from the counter

I don't wanna know the answers
To any of your questions
I don't want
No I really don't want
To be John Lithgow or Jane Curtin
But I'll settle for love
Yeah, I'll settle for love

Before I reached the gate
I realized I had packed my passport
Before security
I realized I had one more bag left
I just wanna know if somethin's
Comin' for to get me

Tell me
Will you make-a me sad
Or happy
And will you settle for love
Will you settle for love1Embed
