Oh What a World Lyrics
Men reading fashion magazines
Oh, what a world it seems we live in
Straight men
Oh what a world we live in
Why am I always on a plane or a fast train?
Oh, what a world my parents gave me
Always travelling
But not in love
Still, I think I'm doing fine
Wouldn't it be a lovely headline?
"Life is beautiful"
On the New York Times

Men reading fashion magazines
(Men reading fashion magazines)
Oh, what a world it seems we live in
Straight men
Oh what a world we live in
Why am I always on a plane or a fast train?
Oh, what a world my parents gave me
Always (always, always) travelling
But not in love
Still, I think I'm doing fine
Wouldn't it be a lovely headline?
"Life is beautiful"
On the New York Times

Oh what a world we live in
Why am I always on a plane or a fast train?
Oh, what a world my parents gave me
Always travelling
But not in love
Still, I think I'm doing fine
Wouldn't it be a lovely headline?
Life is beautifulEmbed
