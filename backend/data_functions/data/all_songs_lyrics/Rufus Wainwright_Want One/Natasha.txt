Natasha LyricsYou walk alone in the valley of life
In the shadow of love
Under the trees of happiness
You walk alone like a baby unborn
Like a father unknown
Like a pocket penniless
I'm happy that you really care
But do you really know how scary
This is for you and is for me?
Oh, do you really know?
Do you really know
Oh, Natasha
All I can do
Is write a song for you
Natasha
Oh, Natasha, for you
I sit alone on the cozy ground floor
On a bench by the garden waiting also
Waiting for love and thinking of
All of the catty remarks I also swallow
And as I've often asked before
Does anybody know how scary
This is for you and is for me?
Does anybody know?
Anybody know
Oh, Natasha
All I can do
Is write a song for you
Natasha
Oh, Natasha
All I can do
Is write a song for you
