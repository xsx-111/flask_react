Go or Go Ahead Lyrics
Thank you for this bitter knowledge
Guardian angels who left me stranded
It was worth it, feeling abandoned
Makes one hardened
But what has happened to love?

You got me writing lyrics on postcards
Then in the evenings looking at stars
But the brightest of the planets is Mars
And what has happened to love?

So I will opt for the big white limo
Vanity fairgrounds and rebel angels
You can't be trusted with feathers so hollow
You're heaven's invention, steel-eyed vampires of love
You see over me

I'll never know what
You have shown to other eyes

Go, or go ahead and surprise me
Signs you've lead the way to a mirage
Go, or go ahead and just try me
What has happened to love
What has happened to love
What has happened to love

Nowhere's now here, smelling of junipers
Fell off the hay bales, I'm over the rainbows
But, oh Medusa, kiss me and crucify
This unholy notion of the mythic powers of love

Look at her eyes, look at her eyes
Forget about the ones that are crying
Look at her eyes, look at her eyes
Forget about the ones that are crying

Go, or go ahead
Go, or go ahead
Go, or go ahead
And surprise me

Go, or go ahead
Go, or go ahead
Go, or go ahead
Go, or go ahead
And just try me
What has happened to love1Embed
