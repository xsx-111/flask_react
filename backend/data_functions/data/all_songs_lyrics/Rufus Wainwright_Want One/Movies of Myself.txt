Movies of Myself LyricsStop me falling down
Stop me making movies of myself
Put that old dog down
Stop me making movies of myself
Bring that carriage 'round
Get me to the garden of sleep
Make that high gate speak
Perrier out of a paper bag
Lookin' like a hag
And start giving me somethin'
A love that is longer than a day
Start makin' my heart sing
Somethin' that it doesn't want to say
I'm handin' it over
I'm sayin' that you're the only one
Don't run for the border
Turn that corner already you've run
In movies of myself
Darlin' don't you ever let me go
Wrap your lovin' arms around me
While the cold winds blow
Tell me what I really wanna know
'Cause I'm looking for a reason a person a painting
A Saturday Evening Post edition by Jesus
An old piece of bacon never eaten by Elvis
So I'll say
Start giving me somethin'
A love that is longer than a day
Start makin' my heart sing
Somethin' it doesn't want to say
I'm handin' it over
I'm sayin' that you're the only one
Don't run for the border
Turn that corner
In movies of myself
Oh I've seen it all before
In movies of myselfEmbed
