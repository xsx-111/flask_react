Put Your Head Out Lyrics
I rip shit like a bow when I flow
And I score points with the joints that I throw
Cause I flow daily, I'm no punk, see
I break backs, make tracks and get funky
There's no one to run to cause nobody cares
MC's drop to your knees, say your prayers
The luck of the Irish is about to kick in
Prepare to die and notify your next of kin
I'm going all out, buck, duck and call out
That's how I'm living, punk you better stall out
This is the House of Pain
To come inside is insane

I'll put your head out (4x)
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
I'll put your head out
Put put your head out
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
Hey what up punk?
I'll put your head out

Who steps to booz?
When the hoods wanna take a cruise
They're feeling effects of the booze
Ain't no clues, to hell with them fools
Who got smoked even though they strap tools
They got brews but I got the boomer
Trigger to blast you and skip the bull
Take my life shit, I'll take you to school
In a duel, what's the difference if you think you're dropping jewels?
Carbon copy, think you're so cool
Stop dreaming and hallucinating
You're caught up in a piece I'm painting
Click click, punk, now you're thinking "Oh shit!"
Quit while you're ahead before I fill you full of lead

Blessed with the gift, and gets with the rhyme
I never say quit when I'm out to get mine
It's live and let die, sit back and get high
Smoking a fat blunt, waiting for some punk
To act up like he's got something in him
Then I grab the mic and start spitting out venom
Carving up headstones, blowing out headphones
Stepping to me, you'll wind up in the Dead Zone
It's nothing personal, that's how it goes, G
Step up with beef and you'll wind up losing teeth
Cause I don't give up the mic that easy
Step back, this ain't government cheese, G
You can stand in line, but you ain't getting it
Talk all the shit you want, but I ain't sweating it
