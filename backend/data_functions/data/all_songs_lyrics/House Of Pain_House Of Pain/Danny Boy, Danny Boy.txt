Danny Boy, Danny Boy Lyrics
Peckerwood, peckerwood, tell me your tale
Please do explain why your skin's so pale
And you're so funky, now how can that be?
Like a bird in a tree you're on the T-O-P

It's the Irish intellect, no one disrespect it
Or shit'll get hectic real quick
This is the House Of Pain (pain)
And plain is one thing we're not
Cause we know we've got
Style and fashion, smoke some hash and
I'm smacking up girls like cars were crashing

Danny Boy, Danny Boy, the pipes are calling
Thought you was a winner, you was, now you're all in

That's right, damn skimpy, you can't get with me
I run the whole track and leave you three laps back

Chop suey don't do me no good
I gotta have corn beef and cabbage if I wanna manage
I'd never eat pig but I'll fuck up a potato
I'm not a dago, but pasta's all that
My pockets stay fat, so step the fuck back
You wanna move on me, you better bring an army
I rip shit daily, ask my man Tom Bailey
I'm rocking the clock like if I was Bill Haley
I'm cocking my Glock and I got my shillelagh
So watch your lady, because I'm
(Danny Boy!) Danny Boy
(Danny Boy!) You know it's Danny Boy
(Danny Boy!) 'S Danny Boy
(Danny Boy!) You know it's Danny Boy
(Danny Boy!) 'S Danny Boy
(Danny Boy!) You know it's Danny Boy
Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side1Embed
