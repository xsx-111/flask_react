Easily Lyrics
Easily, let's get carried away
Easily, let's get married today

Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat
Everything must go
A licking stick is thicker when you break it to show
Everything must go

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there

Easily, let's get caught in a wave
Easily, we won't get caught in a cage

Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over but it's only on the rise
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back

Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go

The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling, I know you must be there
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know you're coming back
