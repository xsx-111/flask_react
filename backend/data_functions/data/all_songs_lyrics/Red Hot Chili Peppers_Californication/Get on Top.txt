Get on Top Lyrics
(Get on top)
(Get on top)
Hit me (Get on top), come get me
I bite but (Get on top) she bit me

Go-rilla, cunt-illa
Sammy D and Salmonella
Come with me 'cause I'm an ass killer
You're ill but I'm iller

I'mma linger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock and
Set you up to get on top

(Get on top) Complications of a mastermind
(Get on top) Last temptation of my kind
(Get on top) Extra planetary sign when do we align
(Get on top) All in time
Right on

Get up (Get on top), come sit up
I light but (Get on top) she lit up
Grasshopper, show stopper
The life of a wife swapper (Get on top)
Come with me 'cause I'm a big bopper
You do but I wopper (Get on top)

Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws

(Get on top) Complications of a mastermind
(Get on top) Last temptation of my kind
(Get on top) Extra planetary sign when do we align
(Get on top) All in time
Right on


(Get on top)
(Get on top)
Hit me (Get on top), come get me
I bite but (Get on top) she bit me
Speed baller, Rhodes Scholar
Bottom bitch and a bottom dollar
Come with me 'cause I'm a free faller
You hoot but I holler

I'mma linger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock on
Set you up to get on top

Get on top
Get on top
Get on top
