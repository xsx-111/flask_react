On with the Show LyricsDead on the ground
I am making a sound
I am too proud to drown
Too proud to drown
As long as I stand
I will take your hand
I will stand with my band
Stand with my band
There's nowhere to go
But on down the road
Let's get on with the show
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on with the show
Waiting too long
But there's no right or wrong
Only where I belong
Where I belong
There'll come a day
When we all feel the same
And we live for the game
Live for the game
There's nowhere to go
But on down the road
Let's get on with the show
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on with the show
There's nowhere to go
But on down the road
Let's get on with the show
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on with the show
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on with the show
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on with the show
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on with the show
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get on
Let's get on let's get onEmbed
