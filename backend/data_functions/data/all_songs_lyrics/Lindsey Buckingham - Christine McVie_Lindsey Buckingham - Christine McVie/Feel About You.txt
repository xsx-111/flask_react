Feel About You LyricsYou're so far away
I wonder if you hear what I say
This love for you I can't conceal
That's how I feel
You are the sky at night
Black and white, green and blue
That's how I feel
You're so beautiful, beautiful
That's how I feel about you
That's how I feel about you
You're honey in my tea
Your jam, it tastes the sweetest to me
This love for you I can't conceal
That's how I feel
You are the sky at night
Black and white, green and blue
That's how I feel
You're so beautiful, beautiful
That's how I feel about you
That's how I feel about you
You're so far away
I know that you're back any day
I am a magnet, you are steel
That's how I feel
You are the sky at night
Black and white, green and blue
That's how I feel
You're so beautiful, beautiful
That's how I feel about you
That's how I feel about you
That's how I feel about you
That's how I feel about youEmbed
