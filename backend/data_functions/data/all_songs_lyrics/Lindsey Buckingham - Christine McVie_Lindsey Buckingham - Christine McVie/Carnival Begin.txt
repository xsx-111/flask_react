Carnival Begin LyricsI open my eyes
The ship was out at sea
People I didn't know
Places I never did see
Too late to conceal it
Too late to hide it
Too late to reveal it
Too late to fight it
I want it all
All the colors and swings
A new merry go round
Carnival begin
You opened the door
And I stepped in
Not knowing where I'm going
But I know I'm gonna win
I can fly again
Got the freedom in my mouth
Travellin' girl is movin' north, west, east, and south
I want it all
All the sparkling things
A new merry go round
Carnival begin
I'll take it all
I may lose or win
A new merry go round
Carnival begin
I always wondered
If you ever miss me
I always thought I heard you call
I always wanted
Wanted to hear your voice
Summer turned into fall
I want it all
Those sparkles and swings
A new merry go round
Carnival begin
I'll take it all
I may lose or win
A new merry go round
Carnival beginEmbed
