Lay Down for Free LyricsStrange music echoed in my head
I waited for words left unsaid
The rains came and washed away my fear
I heard you whisper in my ear
I won't lay down
Lay down for free
I won't lay down
Lay down for free
For free
For free
I touched you
But you were not alone
I reached for you
But you were not at home
I stood by beside our broken bed
Her voice said, calling in my head
I won't lay down
Lay down for free
I won't lay down
Lay down for free
For free
For free
I won't lay down
Lay down for free
I won't lay down
Lay down for free
For free
For freeEmbed
