Game of Pretend LyricsDid I say too much, darling?
Did I give
Give the game away?
Was it that touch that set off the thunder?
More than words could ever say
'Cause you are the reason for my happiness
And I am so blessed
So blessed to find you
You take, take away the emptiness
And I will follow, follow behind you
Did I want too much, baby?
Did I cause you too much pain?
You burn so bright just like a fire
More than words could ever say
'Cause you are the reason for my happiness
And I am so blessed
So blessed to find you
You take, take away the emptiness
And I will follow, follow behind you
I guess I'll never know, dear
'Cause I can't see this end
My heart is where you go, dear
No more games
Game of pretend
'Cause you are the reason for my happiness
And I am so blessed
So blessed to find you
You take, take away the emptiness
And I will follow, follow behind youEmbed
