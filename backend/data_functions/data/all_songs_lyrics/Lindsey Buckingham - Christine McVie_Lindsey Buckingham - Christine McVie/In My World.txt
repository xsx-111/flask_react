In My World LyricsFare
Farewell heart of gold
Maybe we're lost without a cost
Of stories that we've told
In my world everybody stays
Nobody wishes for words they couldn't say
Bless my soul
Let the night unfurl
Dancin' spinnin' dreamin'
Singing in my world
Fare
Farewell liberty
Maybe we're lost without the cost
Of who we used to be
In my world everybody stays
Nobody wishes for words they couldn't say
Bless my soul
Let the night unfurl
Dancin' spinnin' dreamin'
Singing in my world
Lay
Lay down
For a bout
Take your time to cross the line
All without a doubt
In my world everybody stays
Nobody wishes for words they couldn't say
Bless my soul
Let the night unfurl
Dancin' spinnin' dreamin'
Singing in my world
In my world everybody stays
Nobody wishes for words they couldn't say
Bless my soul
Let the night unfurl
Dancin' spinnin' dreamin'
Singing in my world
In my world everybody stays
Nobody wishes for words they couldn't say
Bless my soul
Let the night unfurl
Dancin' spinnin' dreamin'
Singing in my world1Embed
