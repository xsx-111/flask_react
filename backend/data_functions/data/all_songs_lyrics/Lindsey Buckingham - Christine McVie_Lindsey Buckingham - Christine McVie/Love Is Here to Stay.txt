Love Is Here to Stay LyricsTender was your miracle
Tender was your whispered voice
As I lay this soul to rest
Even though I stayed too long
Even though I had no choice
I will do what I do best
Wind blows one way
Time goes
But love is here to stay
When stars come out at night
When the moon is full enough
I will lay this soul to rest
Brook of flowers, hearts of stone
Even though I played too rough
I will do what I do best
Wind blows one way
Time goes
But love is here to stay
In the blue and grey
You ran out to play
It seems like yesterday
Tender was your miracle
Tender was your whispered voice
As I lay this soul to rest
Even though I stayed too long
Even though I had no choice
I will do what I do best
Wind blows one way
Time goes
But love is here to stay
Wind blows one way
Time goes
But love is here to stayEmbed
