Too Far Gone LyricsSomething's creepin' and crawlin' down my spine
Lips are tinglin' and I'm feelin' so fine
I see you look at me
The way you shouldn't do
I know it darling
'Cause I feel the same way too
Too far gone to turn around
Too far, goin' underground
Too far gone
I know what I'm feelin'
It's just a waste of time
'Cause I love you darlin'
Can't get you out of my mind
Maybe I'll move to the other side of town
Find some place where I can't see you look around
Too far gone to turn around
Too far, goin' underground
Too far gone
Too far gone to turn around
Too far, goin' underground
Too far gone
Too far
Too far gone to turn around
Too far, goin' underground
Too far gone
Too far gone
Yes I'm too far gone
Too far gone
Yes I'm too far goneEmbed
