Red Sun LyricsI wonder where you are
As I fold upon my bed
And I think about the way we were
So much left unsaid
I wonder what you're doing
As I walk along the shore
You took your love away from me
When I only wanted more
Sometimes I wonder
Do you ever think of me?
And it's worse for me at night, you know
When the red sun kisses the sea
Slowly breaks the dawn to day
Held it by the sun
My favorite time of day
Or so I thought when we began
My mind is filled with journeys
Echo with your smile
No, you won't take that away from me
Even if you try
Sometimes I wonder
Do you ever think of me?
And it's worse for me at night, you know
When the red sun kisses the sea
Oh, sometimes I wonder
Do you ever think of me?
And it's worse for me at night, you know
When the red sun kisses the sea
Sometimes I wonder
Do you ever think of me?
And it's worse for me at night, you know
When the red sun kisses the seaEmbed
