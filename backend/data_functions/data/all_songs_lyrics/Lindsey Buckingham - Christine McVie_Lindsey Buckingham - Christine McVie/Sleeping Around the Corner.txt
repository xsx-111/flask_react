Sleeping Around the Corner LyricsShe called to me
Meet me at the border
Oh, wake me up, when my papers are in order
X2
Lord, I don't wanna bring you down
No, I never meant to give you a frown
I'm just sleeping round the corner
We made sweet love, over and over
She said: "O sweet darling, I'm your little red rover"
Lord, I don't wanna bring you down
No, I never meant to give you a frown
I'm just sleeping round the corner
I'm just a kiss away, from what you don't know
If you wan't me to stay, you got to let me, you got to let me go
She said to me: "I don't mean to scorn ya"
"But I 'been lying and I've been too scared to warn ya"
2x
Lord, I don't wanna bring you down
No, I never meant to give you a frown
I'm just sleeping round the cornerEmbed
