Standing on the Verge of Getting It On Lyrics
Hey lady, won't you be my dog and I'll be your tree
And you can pee on me
Hey lady, won't you be my dog and I'll be your tree
And you can pee on me
Hey lady, won't you be my dog and I'll be your tree
And you can pee on me
We will do you no harm, other than pee in your afro
Hey lady, won't you be my dog and I'll be your tree
And you can pee on me

Even if you don't dig it
Don't mean it's not the thing or thing to do
It could be just for you
Even if you don't feel it
Right now don't mean someday it'll turn you out
You'll be out of sight
You really shouldn't ought to fight it
The music is designed to do no harm
It's just for you
With just a little bit of effort
I can and well, we might just turn you on

Even if you don't admit it
The time for change is here and here we are
We're just for you
Stick us in your ear and dig us
One time, one time, one time, one time and see
We're just for you
You really shouldn't ought to fight it
The music is designed to do no harm
We're just for you
With just a little bit of effort
I can and well, we might just turn you on
Music is designed to free your funky mind
We have come to help you cope
Out into another reality, you will be
Through our music we'll bring you hope
Ask us what time it is

People, what you doing?
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Really gettin' it on
People, what you doing?
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Really gettin' it on
People, what you doing?
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Really gettin' it on
Song out tonight
Oh, my soul is out tonight
There's a song out tonight
Y'all, come on
There's a song out tonight
Oh, my soul is out tonight
There's a song out tonight
Y'all, come on (One more time)
There's a song out tonight
Oh, my soul is out tonight
There's a song out tonight
Y'all, come on
Ask us what time it is
Even if you don't dig it
Don't mean it's not the thing or thing to do
It could be just for you
You really shouldn't ought to fight it
The music is designed to do no harm
We're just for you (With just a little bit of)

People, what you doing?
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Really gettin' it on
People, what you doing?
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Really gettin' it on
People, doing, yes
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Really gettin' it on
People, what you doing?
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Really gettin' it on
Standing on the verge of gettin' it on
Really gettin' it onEmbed
