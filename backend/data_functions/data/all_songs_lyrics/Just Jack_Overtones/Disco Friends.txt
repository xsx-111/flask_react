Disco Friends LyricsShes got a whole lot of disco friends
Shes got a whole lot of disco friends
Disco ladies and gentlemen
Eating their faces from the inside out
Freaky dancing til the late am
Music slipping down the wall of sweat
Shes catching fishies in a disco net
Throwing kisses in the powder room
Slowly sucking on a cigarette
She knows an awful lot of disco kids
Novelty sun glasses and mullet wigs
She says she wants to be a sti-earl-list
Or maybe something in the music biz
Daddy's rich, mommy's beautiful
They always said she'd make a top model
But now she's hiding out in disco land
A happy clappy trustafarian
Oh yeah
Disco friends
