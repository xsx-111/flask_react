Symphony Of Sirens LyricsYour two eyes they speak to me
Special treats and delicacies
In your velvet corridors
Sticky walls and sugar floors
Your fingers they speak to me
Butterfly wings on a slender tree
You can take a walk down my avenue
Sorbet sunshine melting through
There's a symphony of sirens in the air
Tiny diamonds fall like rain upon your hair
Got feeling completely beyond compare
And I don't care, no I don't care
You're the kinda girl I dreamt about
But I had to do without
Now I'm simply ravenous
I just need a little push
Your mouth it speaks to me
Flicking tongues so sneakily
I don't want this night to end
Close my eyes and count to ten
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10
There's a symphony of sirens in the air
Tiny diamonds fall like rain upon your hair
Got feeling completely beyond compare
And I don't care, no I don't care
My girl she's luminous
She gives me such a rush
Feels like a teenage crush
But I just can't get enough
My girls a genius
She knows all kind of stuff
Feels like my head might bust
But I just can't get enough
My girl she's luminous
She gives me such a rush
Feels like a teenage crush
But I just can't get enough
My girls a genius
She knows all kind of stuff
Feels like my head might bust
But I just can't get enough
There's a symphony of sirens in the air
Tiny diamonds fall like rain upon your hair
Got feeling completely beyond compare
And I don't care, no I don't care
There's a symphony of sirens in the air
Tiny diamonds fall like rain upon your hair
Got feeling completely beyond compare
And I don't care, no I don't care
