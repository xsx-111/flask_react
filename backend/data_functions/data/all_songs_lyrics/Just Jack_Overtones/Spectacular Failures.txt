Spectacular Failures LyricsLife is but a dream in a greater scheme, waking up is hard to do
Even if you're quick, something holds you back, always waiting in a queue for someone
To tell you you're broke, or you should not smoke anymore cigarettes
Planets will align, if you give them time
When you least expect, everything connects, even when the hope is gone there is you
And you'll keep your name, and the things in your brain just might see you through
'Cos you are light, and in darkest night you shine
And I guess we're doing fine, but there's no escaping our spectacular failure
Digging in between things we've never seen, trying to find the missing links
All these scientists are trying every trick just before the city sinks without trace
So much we've achieved, so I hope when we leave there's a smile on our face
'Cos you are light, and in darkest night you shine
And I guess we're doing fine, but there's no escaping our spectacular failureEmbed
