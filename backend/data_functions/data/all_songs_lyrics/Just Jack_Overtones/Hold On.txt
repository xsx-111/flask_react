Hold On LyricsI'm not a young man anymore
But I've got the face of a
19 year old
Probably be a dad soon
Sitting in my front room
With my kids, playdoe mold
But I just hold on to
What I've got
Right now
I'm not who i used to be
Trust me
I've got plans everyday next week
You know your getting older
When the kids on the corner
Have you baffled everytime they speak
So lets just hold on to
What we've got
Right now
Looking round at my friends
And I see that the end of an era
Has come to pass
The fun and the games
And the fluid in our brains
Have all been reduced by half
So lets just hold on to
What we've got
Right Now
I'm not a young man anymore
But I've got the face of a
19 year old
Everything's changed
But I can't complain
Cause I'm doing pretty well all talk
But I just hold on to
What I've got
Right nowEmbed
