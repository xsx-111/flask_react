Starz in their Eyes Lyrics
They'll be making sure you stay amused
They'll fill you up with drugs and booze
Maybe you'll make the evening news
And when you're tripping over your dreams
They'll keep you down by any means
And by the end of the night you'll be stifling your screams
Since you became a VIPerson
It's like your problems have all worsened
Your paranoia casts aspersions
On the truths you know
And they'll just put you in the spotlight
And hope that you'll do alright
Or maybe not

Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
So why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Starz in their eyes?

Remember they said you'd show them all
Emphasise the rise but not the fall
And now you're playing a shopping mall
Your mum and dad they can't believe
What you appear to have achieved
While the rest of these users are just laughing in their sleeves
Since you became a VIPerson
It's like your problems have all worsened
Your paranoia casts aspersions
On the truths you know
And now the tabloids use your face
To document your fall from grace
And then they'll tell you that that's just the way it goes
That's just the way it goes

Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
It's the same old story well they just didn't realise
And it's a long way to come from the Dog and Duck karaoke machine
And Saturday night's drunken dreams
Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
It's the same old story well they just didn't realise
And it's a long way to come from your private bedroom dance routines
And Saturday night's drunken dreams

Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
So why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
Starz in their eyes?
Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
It's the same old story well they just didn't realise
And it's a long way to come from the Dog and Duck karaoke machine
And Saturday night's drunken dreams

(When I grow up I'm going to be famous)
Behind the steel barrier and sequence and glitter
Five-inch heels still knee deep in the litter
Each of them a bitter bullshitter
Wrapped up in the cloak of fake glamour, getting lost in the camera
Well footprints are fools gold, diamonds crusts on their one-off plimsolls
So little time for these one-off arseholes
Rigor mortis Ken and Barbie dolls
A pair of big shades and a push-up bra
It's such a short gap between the gutter and stars
That you've come a long way from the place that you started
So why'd you wanna go and get so downhearted
Welcome to the kingdom of the blagger
Uncut in your nose, Clicquot in your bladder
A whole lot happier a whole lot sadder
Used to be satisfied but now you feel like Mick Jagger...

Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
It's the same old story well they just didn't realise
And it's a long way to come from the Dog and Duck karaoke machine
And Saturday night's drunken dreams
Now why do you wanna go and put starz in their eyes?
It's the same old story well they just didn't realise
And it's a long way to come from your private bedroom dance routines
And Saturday night's drunken dreamsEmbed
