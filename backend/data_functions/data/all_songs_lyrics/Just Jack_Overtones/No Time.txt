No Time LyricsWell how many times have we rowed and thrown tantrums
And how many times have we loaded and cocked the hammers on our verbal guns
And how many times has crockery and cutlery and cups of tea been thrown at me
And how many times have I thrown words back at you I knew could cut you to the bone
How many times have we slept side by side, a thousand miles apart?
And how many times have we thought we could finish something we could never even start?
How many times have I said I love you and I hate you in the same breath?
And how many times have we tried to grab something when there was nothin'...
We got no time
We got no time
We got no time left at all
Well how many times have our friends warned us against this
And I can't remember a time when I have felt so restless
And how many times have you said 'I'm leavin' you no matter what you do'
And how many times have I thrown words back at you I knew could kill you waits and
How many times have we slept side by side, a thousand miles apart?
And how many times have we thought we could finish something we could never even start?
How many times have I said I love you and I hate you in the same breath?
And how many times have we tried to grab something when there was nothin'...
We got no time
We got no time
We got no time left at all
See I don't want to talk about it, the way you broke my heart
I hate so many things about you I wouldn't know where to start
I hate so many things about you I wouldn't know where to start
We got no time
We got no time
We got no time left at all
We got no time left at all
We got no time left now (repeat til end)Embed
