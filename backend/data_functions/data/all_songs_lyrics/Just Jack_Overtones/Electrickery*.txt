Electrickery* Lyrics
I've been meaning to call you
But the rest of my life gets in the way
I can tell by your silence
That you feel you may have been betrayed
But the truth couldn't be
Further from what you expect
All this technology
Still can't make people connect (no)
Two yogurt pots and a piece of string
I need two yogurt pots and a piece of string
Two yogurt pots and a piece of string
I pretty much do almost anything
For two yogurt pots and a piece of string
I need two yogurt pots and a piece of string
For two yogurt pots and a piece of string
I pretty much do almost anything
(Two yogurt pots and a piece of string)
(I need two yogurt pots and a piece of string)
(Two yogurt pots and a piece of string)
(I pretty much do almost anything)

We've been logging on to
'foolishbride.com'
Can't see, 'cause we're so deep in it
Hard feelings getting harder by the minute
We used to talk with words
And face embarrassment like men
Now we clickity-click the little verbs
And press the green button to send (yeah, yeah)
Two yogurt pots and a piece of string (yeah, yeah)
I need two yogurt pots and a piece of string (yeah, yeah)
For two yogurt pots and a piece of string (yeah, yeah)
I pretty much do almost anything (yeah, yeah)
For two yogurt pots and a piece of string (yeah, yeah)
I need two yogurt pots and a piece of string (yeah, yeah)
For two yogurt pots and a piece of string
I pretty much do almost anything

I've been meaning to call you
But the rest of my life gets in the way
And I know if I get through
There won't be many nice things to say (say, say, say, say, say)
Electrickery, (I really wanna talk to you) it's all electrickery
Electrickery, it's all electrickery
Electrickery, it's all electrickery (I really wanna talk to you)
Electrickery, it's all electrickery (I really wanna talk to you)
Electrickery, it's all electrickery (I really wanna)
Electrickery, it's all electrickery (I really wanna)
Electrickery, it's all electrickery (I really wanna)
Electrickery, it's all electrickeryEmbed
