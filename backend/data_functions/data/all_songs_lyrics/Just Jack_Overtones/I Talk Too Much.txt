I Talk Too Much LyricsSometimes I don't say the right things to make you love me even more than you do
Though I try, I just can't apologize for all the things I'm putting you through
I talk too much
And that's why I'm doing in your head (tonight)
We talk too much
Some things are better left unsaid (that's right)
My evil tongue
Does seem to run
With a mind of it's own
I must be cursed
I always make it worse
You may as well just take me home
Sometimes I don't say the right things to make you love me even more than you do
Though I try, I just can't apologize for all the things I'm putting you through
Well I know that you've been through it and you have your scars
All the women are from Venus and the men are from Mars
I could tell you everytime I admit the charge (so wrong)
Last thing I want to do is to cause you grief
When I hide your clean soul from the dark beneath
When it comes to the feeling I can make this brief (so strong)
Below the horizon suns dip
We're playing our hand with one chip
How could we think we had so little to lose?
And in the flights of fireflies
There is a pattern recognized
How could we think we had so little to lose
Sometimes I don't say the right things to make you love me even more than you do
Though I try, I just can't apologize for all the things I'm putting you through
Sometimes I don't say the right things to make you love me even more than you do
Though I try, I just can't apologize for all the things I'm putting you through
And the breath I waste
Just to fill the space
It has built a taste
In your mouth everytime
And yes I'm blessed
And self-obsessed
She gives you more
But I give you less, and less
Well I know that you've been through it and you have your scars
All the women are from Venus and the men are from Mars
I could tell you everytime I admit the charge (so wrong)
Last thing I want to do is to cause you grief
When I hide your clean soul from the dark beneath
When it comes to the feeling I can make this brief (so strong)
She says I know you know what you do but you still keep doing itEmbed
