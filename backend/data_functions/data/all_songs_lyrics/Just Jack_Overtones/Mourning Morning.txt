Mourning Morning LyricsMorning light don't scratch my eyes
Just let me wash up on the shore
I used to have the strangest dreams
But they don't come here anymore
My duvet's laid out like an atlas
With stains to mark the borderlines
Indentations in my pillow
I hope won't fade with time
Smoke the roach left in the ashtray
On which I choked the night before
Stub my toes on dirty clothes
Like mountain ranges on the floor
I pick my way through crusty dishes
And their greasy chemistry
I washed two cups and the remember
That you've left already
I let you go so reluctantly
And I can still hear your lazy symphony
And just when I think I found my calling
It's another mourning morning
They say the devil's in the detail
I'm gonna blur my eyes instead
I put my memories in a landscape
Where only reckless angels tread
I watch the fingerprints you left like
A secret coat upon my skin
And I remember when you told me
A gilded crown won't make a king
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay but sometimes it doesn't show
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay let the conversation flow
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay but sometimes it doesn't show
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
Have to go again
I let you go so reluctantly
And I can still hear your lazy symphony
And just when I think I found my calling
It's another mourning morning
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
I really want you to stay but I know you have to go
Have to go again1Embed
