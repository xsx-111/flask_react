Little Willow Lyrics
Bend, little willow
Wind's going to blow you hard and cold tonight
Life, as it happens
Nobody warns you, willow, hold on tight

Nothing's gonna shake your love
Take your love away
No one's out to break your heart
It only seems that way, hey

Sleep little willow, peace going to follow
Time will heal your wounds
Grow to the heavens, now and forever
Always came too soon
Little willow

Nothing's going to shake your love
Take your love away
No one's out to break your heart
It only seems that way, hey
Bend, little willow
Wind's going to blow you hard and cold tonight
Life, as it happens
Nobody warns you, willow, hold on tight

(Willow)
Ah, little willow
(Willow)
Ah, little willowEmbed
