If You Wanna Lyrics
If you wanna, if you wanna
If you wanna love me again
I'll take you for a ride in my Cadillac
He'll be in the front, we'll be in the back

When you're ready, let me know
I'll be waiting to make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip

And if you wanna, if you wanna
If you wanna do it again
I'll take you to the coast for a holiday
You can be my guest, you can let me pay, yeah

When you're ready, well let me know
I'll be waiting to make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
Whenever you're ready

When you want to love me, this is what you need
To be thinking of me when you plant the seed of love

When you're ready, let me know, I'll be waiting
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip

When you want to love me, this is what you need
To be thinking of me when you plant the seed
The seed of love

If you wanna, if you wanna
If you wanna do it again
I'll take you for a ride in my Cadillac
He'll be in the front, we'll be in the back

When you're ready, let me know, I'll be waiting
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the trip
To make arrangements for the tripEmbed
