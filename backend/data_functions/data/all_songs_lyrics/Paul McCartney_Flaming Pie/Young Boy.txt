Young Boy Lyrics
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love

He doesn't need another helping hand from someone
But don't you think he doesn't understand what he wants - someone
Though independence means a lot, he's gotta still be strong
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love

Find love, a perfect combination
Find love, whatever you do
Find love, a cause for celebration
Then it might come looking (looking)
Come looking for you


Find love, in any situation
Find love, whatever you do
Find love, a cause for celebration
And it might come looking (looking)
Come looking for you
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love
It isn't easy, nothing you can say will help him find love
He's got to do it for himself and it can take so long
He's just a young boy looking for a way to find love

Find love, a time for meditation
Find love, a source of inspiration
Find love, instead of confrontation
Find love, and love will come looking for you1Embed
