Great Day Lyrics
When you're wide awake, say it for goodness sake
It's gonna be a great day
While you're standing there, get up and grab a chair
It's gonna be a great day

And it won't be long, oh no, it won't be long
It won't be long, no no, it won't be long
It won't be long, no no, it won't be long
It won't be long, oh oh
Ooh, ooh, oh yeah
Gonna be a great day

And it won't be long, oh no, it won't be long
It won't be long, oh no, it won't be long
It won't be long, no no, it won't be long
It won't be long, ooh ooh
Yeah

When you're wide awake, say it for goodness sake
It's gonna be a great day
While you're standing there, get up and grab a chair
It's gonna be a great dayEmbed
