Used to Be Bad Lyrics
One, two, three!

I used to be bad, but I don't have to be bad no more
Yeah, I used to be bad, but I don't have to be bad no more
There ain't no doubt about it
People, it's something you can't ignore

Well, I ain't good looking
People, you know I've been up on a shelf
Yes, I know I ain't good looking, and I've been put up on the shelf
But I got a sweet disposition, I like to enjoy myself

I used to be bad, but I don't have to be bad no more
Yeah, I used to be bad, but I don't have to be bad no more
You know I learned my lesson a long, long time ago

Well, no matter what you say, no matter what you do
You got one life to live, it's going to come back home to you
I used to be bad, but I don't have to be bad no more
Yeah, people, I learned my lesson a long, long time ago
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The good Lord made this world and everything that's in it
Well, the way I see it, baby you got to love it to the limit
Oh yes, now people, it's something you can't ignore, yeah
Yes, I used to be bad, but I ain't going to be bad no more

Well, the way you treat me darling made me understand
Never quit you baby, I'm gonna love you to the end
Yeah, I used to be bad, but I ain't going to be bad no more (no more)
Yes, I learned my lesson a long, long time ago

Yes, I learned my lesson a long, long time ago
Yes, I learned my lesson
You're going to reap just what you sowEmbed
