Souvenir Lyrics
When you're fed up, shedding too many tears
And your memories seem like just so many souvenirs
I will come to you to ease the pain

If you want me, tell me now
If I can be of any help, tell me how
Let me love you like a friend
Everything is going to come right in the end

When you're crying like a poor little child
And you're feeling like you never could be reconciled
Don't forget a word of what I'm saying
Oh

If you want me, tell me now
If I can be of any help, tell me how
Let me love you like a friend
Everything is going to come right in the end

Well, I can hold you too tight
I could never let you go but that wouldn't be right
So why don't you let me know (let me know)
Let me know what you wanna do?
Everybody's got a handful of fear
But tomorrow, it may only be a souvenir
Of the way it was till it went away

If you want me, tell me now
If I can be of any help, tell me how
Let me love you like a friend
Every little thing is going to come right in the end

Well, I can hold you too tight
I could never let you go, but that wouldn't be right
So, why don't you let me know what you wanna do?

If you want me, tell me now (You want me... tell me now)
If I can be of any help, tell me how (Tell me how)
Let me love you like a friend (Let me love you... like a friend)
Every little thing is going to come right in the end (Right in the end)

(Souvenir
Souvenir)
No, not another souvenir (Souvenir)
No, no, no, no, no, no
