Somedays Lyrics
Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine
It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soul

Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were
Sometimes it's hard
It's hard to know which way to turn
Don't ask me where I found that picture on the wall
How much it cost or what it's worth
Sometimes I laugh
I laugh to think how young we were

We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels
Some days I cry
I cry for those who live in fear
Some days I don't
I don't remember why I'm here
No use reminding me, it's just the way it is
Who ran the race or came in first
Some days I cry
I cry for those who fear the worst

We don't need anybody else
To tell us what is real
Inside each one of us is love
And we know how it feels

Some days I look
I look at you with eyes that shine
Some days I don't
I don't believe that you are mine
It's no good asking me what time of day it is
Who won the match or scored the goal?
Some days I look
Some days I look into your soul1Embed
