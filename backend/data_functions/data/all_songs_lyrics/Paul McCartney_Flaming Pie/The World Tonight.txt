The World Tonight Lyrics
I saw you sitting at the center of a circle
Everybody, everybody wanted something from you
I saw you sitting there

Saw you swaying to the rhythm of the music
Caught you playing, caught you praying to the voice inside you
Saw you swaying there

I don't care what you wanna be
I go back so far, I'm in front of me
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away, hey hey

I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

I heard you listening to a secret conversation
You were crying, you were trying not to let them hear you
I heard you listening in
Never mind what they want to do
You've got a right to your point of view
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away, hey hey

I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

I can see the world tonight

I saw you hiding from a flock of paparazzi
You were hoping, you were hoping
That the ground would swallow you
I saw you hiding there

I don't care what you wanna be
I go back so far, I'm in front of me
It doesn't matter what they say
They're giving the game away, hey hey
I can see the world tonight
Look into the future
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight

Look into the future
I can see the world tonight
See it in a different light
I can see the world tonight
I can see the world tonight1Embed
