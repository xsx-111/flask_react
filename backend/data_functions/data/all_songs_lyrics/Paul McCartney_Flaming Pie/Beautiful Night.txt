Beautiful Night Lyrics
Someone's gone out fishing, someone's high and dry
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky
And I'm left stranded, wondering why

You and me together, nothing feels so good
Even if I get a medal from my local neighbourhood
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles
And I'm still stranded, wondering why

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold

Some boat's on the ocean, we're here in this room
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky
No more wondering, wondering why
Things can go wrong, things can go right
Things can go bump in the dead of the night
So let me be there, let me be there
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night

Make it a beautiful night for me
It's a beautiful night for love
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Make it a beautiful night for me
Such a beautiful night for love
Such a wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold
Yeah, it's beautiful night
Yeah, it's beautiful night
Ah

Yeah, a beautiful night, beautiful night
Yeah, it's such a beautiful night, beautiful, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night
Lordie, lordie, lordie mama
Away, on your way, thank youEmbed
