Really Love You Lyrics
Well, I need you through the night
When morning comes I love the light
But in the night-time that dark is black
Come on baby you got to help me get back

I love you, oh yeah
I really love you, oh yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Do one thing, do one thing for me
If you've got love then let me see
If you feel it in your heart then show it right now
You know I love you baby, I gotta get to you, get to you somehow

Oh yeah, I really love you
Oh yeah, I really love you
You know it's true
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I really love you day and night
Yeah, I really love you in the morning light
I really love you, sure be right
Come on little baby gotta find out, find out somehow
Yeah, yeah, I really love you
Oh yeah, I really love you

I love the things you say and do
I can't get over how much I love you
You know you do something special to me
And that's the way I want it always to be, yeah

Oh yeah, I really love you
Oh yeah, I really love you

I need your love like a bear needs a break
I need your heart, baby hopping on a plate
I need the sunshine of your smile
Help me walk, help me walk that extra mile

Little baby, I love you
Oh yeah, you know I really love you
Oh yeah, you know it's true
Oh yeah, I love youEmbed
