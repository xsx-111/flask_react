Desperado Lyrics
I'm a gambler and I'm a runner
But you knew that when you lay down
I'm a picture of ugly stories
I'm a killer and I'm a clown

Step into the street by sundown
Step into your last goodbye
You're a target just by living
Twenty dollars will make you die
I wear lace and I wear black leather
My hands are lightning upon my gun
My shots are clean and my shots are final
My shots are deadly and when it's done

You're as stiff as my smoking barrel
You're as dead as a desert night
You're a notch and I'm a legend
You're at peace and I must hide
Tell me where the hell I'm going
Let my bones fall in the dust
Can't you hear that ghost that's calling
As my Colt begins to rust, in the dust
I'm a killer, I'm a clown
I'm a priest that's gone to townEmbed
