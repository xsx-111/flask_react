You Drive Me Nervous Lyrics
Yeah, you seem so civilized
Your mama's tryin' to run your life
Your daddy's tryin' to pick your wife
Oh no

Yeah, you run around with all that hair
They just don't like those rags you wear
You say, "I'm gonna pack up my stuff
I'm gonna run away"

And then you say
"You drive me nervous, nervous"
And then I said
"You drive me nervous, nervous, nervous, oh"
Nervous, nervous, nervous, nervous, whoa-oh-oh
Aw!
You're out of state, you're thrown in jail
You ain't got the bread to pay the bail
Your mom and papa come up and said
"Honey, where did we fail?"
And then you scream
"You drive me nervous, nervous"
And then I scream
"You drive me nervous, nervous, nervous, oh"
Nervous, nervous, nervous, nervous, whoa-oh-oh
You drive me ne-ne-ne-nervous
Ne-ne-ne-nervous
You drive me nervous
Whoa!Embed
