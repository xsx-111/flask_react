Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Lyrics
You can be my slave and I'll be a stranger
We could be in passion, we could be in danger
Take you off the street
Put you under my wings, yeah

You could pull my leg or anything
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
You could be the devil, you could be the saviour
Well I really can't tell
By the way that your behaviour
I'll take you off the boat
Put you under my wings, yeah

You could pull my leg or anything
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah!
I don't know what you're playin'
Don't even know what you're sayin'
You gotta leave me alone
I'm gonna go on home

Aw! The things are getting tougher
Yeah, the things are getting rougher
This is Alice speaking, suffer
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You could be the devil, you could be the saviour
Well I really can't tell
By the way that your behaviour
Take you off the street
Put you under my wings, yeah

You could pull my leg or anything
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
