Naked Lyrics
I wake up in the mornin'
Put on my face
The one that's gonna get me
Through another day
Doesn't really matter
How I feel inside
This life is like a game sometimes
But then you came around me
The walls just disappeared
Nothing to surround me
And keep me from my fears
I'm unprotected
See how I've opened up
Oh, you've made me trust

'Cause I've never felt like this before
I'm naked around you
Does it show?
You see right through me and I can't hide
I'm naked around you
And it feels so right
(Yeah, yeah)

I'm tryin' to remember
Why I was afraid
To be myself and let the
The covers fall away
Guess I never had someone like you
(To help me) To help me fit
In my skin
I've never felt like this before
I'm naked around you
Does it show?
You see right through me and I can't hide
I'm naked around you
And it feels so right

I'm naked
Oh, oh, yeah
Does it show?
(Yeah) I'm naked
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Oh, oh
I'm naked around you
Does it show?
I'm so naked around you
And I can't hide
You're gonna, you're gonna see right through
(You see right through me and I can't hide)
You're gonna see right through
(I'm naked around you)
Oh, yeah, yeah
I'm so naked around you
And I can't hide
You're gonna see right through, baby5Embed
