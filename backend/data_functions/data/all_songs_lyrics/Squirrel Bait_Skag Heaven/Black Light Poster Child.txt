Black Light Poster Child LyricsBlack light poster child
Is your face too tired to smile?
Bazooka head police cop dreams in black and white
Living black days under white light
What became of the chicks you knew?
Or the man that you hanged?
The tales got taller your hair did too
When no one listen you got nothing to do
Poster child your scars I've seen
But what are they supposed to mean?
If you've seen it all if you're so wise
Tell me what goes on between those eyes
Living in the cellar no windows to see
Under a black light no images free
A unicorn or harley from hell
Only paper pals to smell your smells
Little black light poster child
Is your face too tired to smile?
Bazooka head police cop dreams in black and white
Living black days under white light
Poster child your scars I've seen
But what are they supposed to mean?
If you've seen it all if you're so wise
Tell me what goes on between those eyes
Living in the cellar no windows to see
Under a black light no images free
A unicorn or harley from hell
Only paper pals to smell your smellsEmbed
