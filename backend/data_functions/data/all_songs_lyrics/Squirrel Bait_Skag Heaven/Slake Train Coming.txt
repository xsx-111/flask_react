Slake Train Coming LyricsI prepare with the same old thoughts
The cackling of whores as they laugh and speak
Arched backs bounce on peak faces covered with hair
Show concentration and a stare
Yeah
I thirst and I slake
It's my gift to you and you decide and you subside
It's history now
And as flesh is on both ears those old hands force it near
I come to attention and make my decision to leaveEmbed
