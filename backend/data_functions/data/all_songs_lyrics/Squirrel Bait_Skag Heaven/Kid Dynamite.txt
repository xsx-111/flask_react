Kid Dynamite LyricsThe skag is set-up threatened to slap his head off
Come on come on some fun
He pulls a blade on the blade
Turns tail and needs to run to see more rises than sets
There ain't nothing that he regrets
Was a has-been now's an am-is the kid laughs
"I don't need no pig stomping on my buzz"
All alone but when he wants to be
He hangs out with the sparse company
If she thaws he withdraws
The bastard stands and he says
"I don't need no pig stomping on my buzz."Embed
