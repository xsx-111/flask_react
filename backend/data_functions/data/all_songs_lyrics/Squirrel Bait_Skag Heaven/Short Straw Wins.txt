Short Straw Wins LyricsShort straw always wins
Like the cockroach crows
There are things
I don't want to know
Lights are on ain't nobody home
Giggle now and laugh last
Eyes are open
Think fast
Skid marks mark the spot
There's no point in asking why
You paid me off too long ago
Cross my palm hope to die
Lights are on ain't nobody home
Giggle now, laugh last
Eyes are open
Think fast
Seventy miles on a ninety degree turn
The hard way's the best to learn
Short straw always wins
Like the cockroach crows
Skid marks mark the spot
There's no point in asking why
You paid me off too long ago
Cross my palm hope to dieEmbed
