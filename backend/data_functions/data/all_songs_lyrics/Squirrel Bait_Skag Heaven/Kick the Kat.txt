Kick the Kat LyricsIt's a harsh toke buddy
But you're messing with your life
When the sun's shining hot
The devil's beating your wife
You can take to the window to see where she's at
You can do all this and kick the cat
I was feeling too good it wasn't right at all
And it smelled like gasoline
And it smelled like exhaust
I need to get my head on straight
So I can screw it up all the better next time
The heap the home the bed
Whatever you'd say it's been
It hold the smell and you won't soon slide back
In you can take to the roof to see where she's at
You can do all this and kick the catEmbed
