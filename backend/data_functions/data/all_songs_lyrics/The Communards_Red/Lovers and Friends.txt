Lovers and Friends LyricsAll night you'd lay asleep
Enfolded in my arms
Breathing slow and sweet
I never understood
How it would prove to be
Such a luxury to feel
Your hand, warm in my hand
Your kiss onmy cheek
Lovers and friends
Are all that matter
You'll never know how much it
Came to mean to me
To have you by my side
In battles lost and won
And now I understand
These things can never be
Guaranteed
I wish I could recall
Each mundane tenderness
Remember every look, each word
Preserve every breath
Each kiss, each caress
Lovers and friends
Are all that matter
I never thought that I would
Watch you drowning
Far from any sea, on crumpled sheets
White sand in your eyes
Lovers and friends
Are all that matter
And now when all I have of you
Is a memory
I raise my hand to touch my cheek
Imprinted with your loveEmbed
