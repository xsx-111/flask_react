Tomorrow LyricsLike the knife of a thief that's held close to the throat
I'm threatened by you and the cruel way you gloat
You once turned me on
Now it all seems so remote
You broke me in pieces
You cherished each blow
The harder you hit me
The stronger I grow
I'll leave you tomorrow
Take my pride and
You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul
I've had all I can take
You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul
I've had all I can take
I'm leaving tomorrow
I'm leaving tamorrow
I'm leaving
I've had all I can take
Don't tell me you love me
Your tears are too late
Your trap was deception
And I took the bait
The animal in you
You can't keep at bay
I'm not your possession to treat as you wish
Your silence will slowly destroy you each day
I'm leavincl tomorrow
My love for life is great
You may break the skin but you can t kill the soul
. . 
You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul
. . 
I'm leaving tomorrow
I'm leaving tomorrow
I'm leaving
Yes
I'm leaving!
You broke me in pieces
You cherished each blow
. . 
You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul
. . 
You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul
. . 
I'm leaving tomorrow
I'm leaving tomorrow
You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul
. . 
You may break the skin but you can't kill the soul
