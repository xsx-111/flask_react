Matter of Opinion LyricsOo many times I've thought that I could stick around
But now I know there's something I've just got to do
I've got to move on and find some expression
Some return on all I'm giving
I know I can do it, with or without you
Understand--won't you try to understandn my point of view
Understand--c'mon and try a little, try a little, try a little please do
I could explain but why should I waste my time on you?
Life's too short, every day brings something new
I know that I could be good for
Someone else who believes in me
Someone who will move me body and soul
There are changes I must make
To make my life seem all worthwhile
I can't pretend I still need you
There's no motivation, inspiration
Nothing seems to come from you
So here is all I've got to say, hey hey
Understand--won't you try to understandn my point of view
Understand--c'mon and try a little, try a little, try a little please doEmbed
