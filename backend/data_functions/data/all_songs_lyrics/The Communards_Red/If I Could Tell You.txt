If I Could Tell You LyricsTime will say nothing but I told you so, Time only knows the price we have to pay; If I could tell you I would let you know
If we should weep when clowns put on their show, If we should stumble when musicians play, Time will say nothing but I told you so
There are no fortunes to be told, although, Because I love you more than I can say, If I could tell you I would let you know
The winds must come from somewhere when they blow, There must be reasons why the leavers decay; Time will say nothing but I told you so
Perhaps the roses really want to grow, The vision seriously intends to stay; If I could tell you I would let you know
Suppose the lions all get up and go, And all the brooks and soldiers run away; Will time say nothing but I told you so? If I could tell you I would let you knowEmbed
