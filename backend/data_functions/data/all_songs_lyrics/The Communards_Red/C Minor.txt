C Minor LyricsNow I know where you go, what you do, When you're away from me. Who he is, what's his name, where he lives, all the aims, But no longer will I play your foolish game. You took me heart and you tore it in too many pieces, But I've put it all together again. There's a fire down in me That's burning so bright With a longing, with a yearning to be free.I won't cry, I won't cry, No I won't waste my tears, I'll get by , I'll survive without you. I gave you the stars, I gave you the moon and my heart, But you took them all and threw them all away. I don't want you, I don't need you, Hard as I try, I've got strength enough down inside for two. When you leave, when you leave, Just look the other way, I won't waste my breath, my tears, There's nothing to sayEmbed
