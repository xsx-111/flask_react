Victims LyricsBilly sits alone and wonders what to do and where to go
Billy grows tired every day and meaning seems to fade away
Billy knows he's not alone, he knows he's not to blame
Others fear through ignorance
And Billy's cared to stay among the whispers barely spoken
Billy feels contempt, indignant words from hypocrites
To them it's God's revenge
No-one to blame, there's only victims
No-one to blame, there's only victims
No-one to blame, there's only victims
No-one to blame, there's only victims
Billy worked with other men, to them was once a lad
When they learned of Billy's story, went behind his back
Spread around the factory floor, then Billy got the sack
Friends have washed their hands of Billy, he feels so betrayed
No-one to blame, there's only victims
No-one to blame, there's only victims
No-one to blame, there's only victims
No-one to blame, there's only victims
Billy's young and Billy's dying, fighting every day
The few he trusts will give him strength, they will not walk away
Love will never wash its hands, and never will betray
Billy can't escape the truth, but he won't die alone
No-one to blame, there's only victims. (To fade)Embed
