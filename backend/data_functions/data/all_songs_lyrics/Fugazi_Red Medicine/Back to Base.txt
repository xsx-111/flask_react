Back to Base LyricsAutonomy
Is a world of difference
They're creeping round but they know they can't come in
Back from the front
With observation
It is still there
Across from me
An extreme example
Bringing you what they want
Twenty four hours a day
Whole lot of not
But it's convenient
Pray for fire
Bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you
Bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you
Bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you
Bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you
Bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you
Bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you
Bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you
They'll tell you anything
It's speculation
Pure speculation
They'll tell you anything
It's speculation
Pure speculation
They'll tell you anything
They'll tell you anything
Bringing you, bringing you, bringing you, bringing you back to baseEmbed
