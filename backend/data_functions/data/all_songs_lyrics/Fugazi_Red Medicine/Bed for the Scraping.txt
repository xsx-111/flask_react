Bed for the Scraping LyricsI'm sick with this, I'm sick with this
Situation avoided or just missed?
My own sweet time says it's ten twenty four
Hardly recognise simple things anymore
I don't want to be defeated
I don't want to be defeated
I don't want to be defeated
I don't want to be defeated
I don't want to be defeated
I don't want to be defeated
This is the point
This is the manifest
Bed for the scraping
Dirty little secret
Reason for the gathering
Consequence
What else is there to do?
But go...
This is the point
This is the manifest
Bed for the scraping
Dirty little secret
Reason for the gathering
Consequence
What else is there to do?
What else is there to do?
But go outside, look, look, look, look, look, look around
(Look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around)
Look around
(Look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around, look around)
Look around1Embed
