Do You Like Me LyricsYour eyes like crashing jets
Fixed in stained glass
But not religious
You should pay rent in my mind
Say like the French say:
"Bonsoir, regret, à demain"
À demain, à demain
À demain, à demain
À demain, à demain
À demain, à demain
Do you like me?
Do you like me?
Do you like me?
Do you like me I guess
White witness moves to petition
The state of Virginia for 27 prisons
While in Bethesda an office flaming
Youth group singing
Firemen calling in
Lockheed Lockheed Martin Marietta
Lockheed Lockheed Martin Marietta
Lockheed Lockheed Martin Marietta
Lockheed Lockheed Martin Marietta
Do you like me?
Do you like me?
Do you like me?
Do you like me I guess
Step on!
End of the lesson, time for one question
End of the lesson, time for one more question
I've got a question
I've got a question
I've got a question
I've got a question
I've got a question
I've got a question
I've got a question
I've got a question
I've got a question
Ha-ah
Ha-ah
Do you like me?
Do you like me?
Do you like me?
Do you like me?1Embed
