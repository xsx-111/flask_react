Latest Disgrace Lyrics
I am a message, prescient
Forecasting, there is a limit
So take my temperature
You say:
"Your turn"
But I think
This invite's open to all

So come on
Take your medicine
Hey doctor, heal yourself
Or you got too much to lose?
So come on
Take your medicine
Hey doctor, now
Come on

You are a message, precious
Extracting, forging a tactic
To get your motion through
You say
"Don't know, not sure"
But I think
No holster's empty for you
So come on
Take your medicine
Hey doctor, heal yourself
Or you got too much to lose?
So come on
Take your medicine
Hey doctor, come on now
Let's go

Shoot out and shoot out the shadows
Shoot out and shoot out the shadows
Shoot out and shoot out the shadows
Yeah

This latest disgrace
Let's ... 
Get the notion Embed
