Fell, Destroyed LyricsHere's a list of side effects
Practice tested
Covering every maliced angle
For example:
You will sleep forever
You will never sleep again
Yawn to yawn
The face is born to mask the shade of shit you're in
Now it's time to fake resignments
Room assignment
Next door to the generator
What the fuck it is
Whatever powers lights to burn all night
Your teeth to grind
To grind so fine
You'll find out sooner what it is
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
Fell, destroyed and long out used
Step into it
Green in laying, water blue
Shot not shaking
Cop a feeling coprophagics
Say next in line, well how about you
Freedom's fiction sorry fifteen
Time to sell the softer shoe
Don't say you did what you do
(Come on now)
Don't say you'd say what you'd do to someone
Don't, don't you say what you do
(Come on now)
Don't say you'd say what you'd do to someone
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
(Yes, I have a sense of humor
Don't you sense my sense of humor?)
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
(Yes, I have a sense of humor
Don't you sense my sense of humor?)
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
(Yes, I have a sense of humor
Don't you sense my sense of humor?)
Ring the alarm or you're sold to dying
(Yes, I have a sense of humor
Don't you sense my sense of humor?)Embed
