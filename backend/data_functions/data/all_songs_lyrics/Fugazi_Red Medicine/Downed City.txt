Downed City LyricsI want to go
I want to get out
All guns are loaded
And have gone off now
I'm channelling
17 dead revolutions
That have long gave up the ghost
And I don't wanna
I don't wanna
One drink of water and I'm...
The space between
The dime and dollar
The space between
The city and the suburb
Some kid took another kid
Pumped him full of holes
Just to see a new horizon
And I don't wanna
I don't wanna
One drink of water and I'm drowning in it
Not alright
Downed city
Downed city
Not alright
Two and two
Sawed in two
Two and two
Two and two
Sawed in two
Two and two
The city is
The city, the city is
The city, the city is
The city bring
The city is
The city is
The city, the city isEmbed
