Birthday Pony LyricsThis is a birthday pony
This is a birthday pony
This is a birthday pony
This is a strange kind of rest
Because I feel like a guest
When I'm right here at home
I'm not
Right here at home
I opened up these accounts
All these separate accounts
Because I can't comprehend
The single ride to the end
I needed something to do
And so I split into two
But now the pattern takes hold
I find I'm losing control
Yeah, heh, hahaha
Yeah, hahahaha
Laugh boy 
Laugh boy 
Laugh boy 
I don't want to be free 
Be free 
Be free 
This is a birthday pony
This is a birthday pony
This is a birthday pony
This is a birthday ponyEmbed
