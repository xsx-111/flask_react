Forensic Scene Lyrics
In your memory not so gentle
Perversify slash sentimental
Caught between and caught without
I'm a failure not your failure now
In and out just like a knife would
Tax the flesh and leave a cheap wound
Fucked and fucking love and lay
Congenitally fractured anyway

Unclipped, unclean
This forensic scene's all played out
The defense rests and sorry's just
A no shit Sherlock mouth talk con job

From your memory to this instant
Worked so hard for working distance
Like a mouth too late to shut
I'm a failure not your failure now

Unclipped, unclean
This forensic scene's all played out
The defense rests and sorry's just
A no shit Sherlock mouth talk con job
No shit Sherlock mouth talk con job
No shit Sherlock mouth talk con job
No shitEmbed
