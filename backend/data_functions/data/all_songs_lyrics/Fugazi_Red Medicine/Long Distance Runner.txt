Long Distance Runner Lyrics1, 2, 3
The farther I go the less I know
One foot goes in front of the other
It all boils down
To not hang around
To keep moving
In front of the gravity, gravity, gravity, gravity
The answer is there, the answer is there
But there is not a fixed position
It keeps moving along and I keep coming along
That's why I'm a long distance runner, runner, runner, runner
Aaaahhhh
And if I stop to catch my breath
I might catch a piece of death
I can't keep your pace
If I want to finish this race
My fight's not with you
It's with the gravity
Long distance runner
Long distance runner
Long distance runner
Long distance runner
Long distance runner
Long distance runner
Long distance runner
Long distance runnerEmbed
