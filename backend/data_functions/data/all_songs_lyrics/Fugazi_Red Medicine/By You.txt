By You LyricsGeneration fuck you too
Define and redefine
You'd make them all the same
But molds they break away
Safely inside looking outside
Go keep on picking at it
It's just going to get bigger
Not yet an also-ran
The note left in your hand
Is by you
Asked to cease and desist
What aggravation preordained
It feels so good laying down
I won't get up again
Where's my life
My life
You're in control like you don't know
Don't say
You're along for the ride
Sitting down when you should stand
The line is in your hand
It's by you
Hand over hand over hand over
Hand over hand over hand overEmbed
