Poor Boy Blues LyricsIt's easy to see a poor boy's blues
When he's working every day
It's harder to be there in his shoes
He was born to be that way
If I tell you tomorrow I'm leaving
Would you understand the reason why?
A poor boy works hard for his living
But a rich man he plays to pass the time
So goodbye, pleased to know you
We had some laughs along the way
But I have to be leaving
And there's nothing you can do to make me stay
If I tell you tomorrow I'm leaving
Would you understand the reason why?
A poor boy works hard for his living
But a rich man he plays to pass the time
So goodbye, pleased to know you
We had some laughs along the way
But I have to be leaving
And there's nothing you can do to make me stayEmbed
