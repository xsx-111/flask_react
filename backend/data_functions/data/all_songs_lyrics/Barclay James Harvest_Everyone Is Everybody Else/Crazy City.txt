Crazy City LyricsRunning alone in the crazy city
Look at the face of once were pretty
People then wonder what happened
To make it that way
Listen around you, have you heard?
Climb on the back of a silver bird
London to L.A. before you can think
What to say
Stop awhile, take a smile
Know that you're living in today
Up and down, look around
No need to hide yourself away
Out in the country's where I'm going
Back where the tree of life's still growing
Take a free ride where the tide
Flows the way of your heart
Follow the wild dove where he's flying
Out where the sun is never crying
Wait at the gate or they'll stop you
And blow you apart
Stop awhile, take a smile
Know that you're living in today
Up and down, look around
No need to hide yourself awayEmbed
