The Great 1974 Mining Disaster LyricsHeard a song the other day
About a major out in space
And though the song was kind of grey
It took me far away
Heard the news the other day
About a sailor oh so gay
And though his policies were grey
They took me far away
'Cause I couldn't stand the thought
Of being taken in again
Have you seen my life, Mr. Groan?
Do you know what it's like to be outside?
All you have to do is smile to cause a landslide
And you do, and you do, Mr. Groan
Heard a song just yesterday
About a man who sold the world away
And though the song was still quite grey
It took me far away
'Cause I couldn't stand the thought
Of being taken in again
Have you seen my life, Mr. Groan?
Do you know what it's like to be outside?
All you have to do is smile to cause a landslide
And you do, and you do, Mr. GroanEmbed
