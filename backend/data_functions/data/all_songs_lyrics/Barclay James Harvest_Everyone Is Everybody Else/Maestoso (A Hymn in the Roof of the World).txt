Maestoso (A Hymn in the Roof of the World) LyricsIt's so strange that I should meet you
Here upon the highest point of earth
It's safe to say we've proved our worth
In others' eyes today
And the flags that we both hold
Are altogether vain and meaningless
These standards that we've strived to bless
It's time we threw away
We should fall upon our knees
And thank sweet God we are alive
Sweet God we are alive
Sweet God we are alive!
All across the face of earth
The clouds are gathering to hide the ways of man
There is no earthly plan
Up here at Heaven's door
And the air is pure enough
To wipe away all doubts of innocence
Repent! Rejoice! Make recompense
For now and evermore
We should fall upon our knees
And thank sweet God we are alive
Sweet God we are alive
Sweet God we are alive!Embed
