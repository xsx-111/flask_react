Child of the Universe LyricsI'm a child of South Africa
I'm a child of Vietnam
I'm a child of Northern Ireland
I'm a small boy with blood on his hands
Yes I'm a child of the universe
Yes I'm a child of the universe
You can see me on the TV every night
Always there to join in someone else's fight
I didn't ask to be born, and I don't ask to die
I'm an endless scream, a gene machine
That cannot reason why
Yes I'm a child of the universe
Yes I'm a child of the universe
You can see me on the TV every day
I'm the child next door three thousand miles awayEmbed
