What Is This LyricsOh lord it gets so complicated
Oh lord I don't know what to do
God! it looks so hopeless
But I know it isn't true
What is this that gives me hope
In the middle of the night
Makes me turn to you
What is this that lights my way
Through the hours of the day
Tell me what to do
Oh lord they say that I don't know you
Oh lord they say I am deceived
God! you tell me different
I have no choice but to believe
What is this that gives me hope
In the middle of the night
Makes me run to you
What is this that lights my way
Through the hours of the day
Tell them that it's...
Oh! they make you look so foolish
Oh! they make you out the fool
God! it looks so hopeless
Oh, but I know it isn't true
What is this that gives me hope
In the middle of the night
Makes me run to you
What is this that lights my way
Through the hours of the day
Tell me that it's true
What is this that gives me hope
In the middle of the night
Makes me run to you
What is this that lights my way
Through the hours of the day
Tell me that it's you
Tell them, tell me
Yeah, yeah
