Wonder LyricsThis is war
This is peace
Quiet roars
Of silent screams
It makes me think
It makes me deal
With the situation
How do i feel?
There's a wall between us
A partition of sorts
And it makes me wonder
There's a sign ahead
Says it's gonna be okay
And it makes me wonder
Should I go to the front?
Or should I go to the back?
Should I just pray?
Or should I attack?
This is church
This is state
Rock-n-roll
Amazing grace
It makes me think
It makes me deal
With the situation
How do I feel?
There's a wall between us
A partition of sorts
And it makes me wonder
There's a sign ahead
Says it's gonna be okay
And it makes me wonder
Should I go to the front?
Or should I go to the back?
Should I just pray?
Oh, or should I attack?
Should I go to the front?
Or should I go to the back?
Should I just pray?
Or should I attack?
Oh-oh-oh
It makes me wonder, yeah
Said it makes me wonderEmbed
