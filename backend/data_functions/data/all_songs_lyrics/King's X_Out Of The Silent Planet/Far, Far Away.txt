Far, Far Away LyricsInside it's lonely
I drive my car
Pass by the signs that speak our past
Always remind me
Can't block it out
The story we all knew would last
She was lost yesterday
(Far) far away
(Far) far away
Familiar faces
Annually haunt me
The cold brings seasons of the heart
Always reminded
Can't block it out
No one could see it from the start
She was lost yesterday
(Far) far away
(Far) far away
(Far) far away
(Far) far away
Inside it's lonely
I drive my car
Pass by the signs that speak our past
Always reminded
Can't block it out
The story we all knew would last
She was lost yesterday
(Far) far away
(Far) far away
(Far) far away
(Far) far away
Far, far away
Far, far awayEmbed
