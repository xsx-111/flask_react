Goldilox LyricsI can't believe summer's almost here
I made it through another year even if alone
But there's no tears in my eyes
Life is still full of surprise
I'm not looking for a one night stand
I stand behind you and I watch you from a mile away
Wishing you could be the one but not here this way
I got to know your name
And I must know who you are, yeah
I look at you and I know who you are
You're just a little bit too far from my home
But please don't get me wrong
Even though it has been long
I hope I never sing my last song without someone
I stand behind you and I watch you from a mile away
Wishing you could be the one but not here this way
I got to know your name
And I must know who you are, yeah
I stand behind you and I watch you from a mile away
I'm wishing you could be the one but not here this way
I'd like to know your name
And I must know who you are, yeahEmbed
