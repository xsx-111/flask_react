In the New Age LyricsHumanity is looking for itself
The ancient wisdom taken from the shelf
A light so dark a heaven that is hell
(In the new age)
Could it already be
(In the new age)
Through the haze I can see
(In the new age)
What can happen to me
(In the new age)
I see the blind lead the blind
(In the new age)
In the search for the mind
(In the new age)
But I know what they'll find
The trap is open no one even cares
The well-disguised one hidden in their stares
(In the new age)
I see the blind lead the blind
(In the new age)
In the search for the mind
(In the new age)
But I know what they'll find
Disguise your lying words with love
Depending on the good of man
The truth the symbol of a dove
Will unmask the maker of your plans
(In the new age)
I see the blind lead the blind
(In the new age)
In the search for the mind
(In the new age)
But I know what they'll find
(In the new age)
(In the new age)
(In the new age)
