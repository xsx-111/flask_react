Power of Love LyricsTrapped inside these walls surround me
Closing in it's hard to breathe
It's okay, I hear the shouting
What is left the will to be
The power
Power of love
Takes me, takes me from here
Oh the power of love
On my hand I have no scars
But in my heart's a weary beat
If you go
I will follow
Where you are
I will be
The power
Power of love
Takes me, takes me from here
Oh the power of love
The power
Power of love
Takes me, takes me from here
Oh the power of love
On my hand I have no scars
In my heart's a weary beat
If you go
I will follow
Where you are
I will be
The power
Power of love
Takes me, takes me from here
Oh the power of love
The power
Power of love
Takes me, takes me from here
Oh the power of love
It's the power of loveEmbed
