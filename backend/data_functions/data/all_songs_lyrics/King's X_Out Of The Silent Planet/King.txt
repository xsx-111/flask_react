King Lyrics(You are the one)
Who causes me pain
(You are the one)
Who causes me grief
(You are the one)
Who lied to me
It won't be long soon you will see
King is coming
King is coming
King is coming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
King is coming
(You are the one)
Who magnifies hate
(You are the one)
Who destroys our love
(You are the one)
Disguised as a saint
It won't be long your kingdom will quake
King is coming
King is coming
King is coming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
King is coming
King is coming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
King is coming
King is coming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
King is coming
(You are the one)
Who causes me pain
(You are the one)
Who causes me grief
(You are the one)
Who lied to me
It won't be long soon you will see, oh
King is coming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
King is coming
King is coming
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
King is coming
Yeah-yeah
I've been waiting
Yeah-yeahEmbed
