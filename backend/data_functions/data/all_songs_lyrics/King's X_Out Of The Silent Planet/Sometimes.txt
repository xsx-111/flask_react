Sometimes LyricsSometimes I sink
Sometimes I climb
It all fits in
It's all in time
I stand here crying
The world is laughing
I stand surrounded yet I see the lies
I stand here waiting
For new Jerusalem
I know it's greater than the world outside
Sometimes I shout
Sometimes I hide
It all begins
It's all in time
I stand here crying
The world is laughing
I stand surrounded yet I see the lies
I stand here waiting
For new Jerusalem
I know it's greater than the world outside
I stand here crying
The world is laughing
I stand surrounded yet I see the lies
I stand here waiting
For new Jerusalem
I know it's greater than the world outside
I stand here crying
The world is laughing
I stand surrounded yet I see the lies
I stand here waiting
For new Jerusalem
I know it's greater than the world outsideEmbed
