Visions LyricsThe lunatic says goodbye to those who say they love him
He's wise within himself as this craziness surrounds him
From his lips come truth within insanity
And people passing by don't hear and cannot see
(Cursing the darkness)
Visions inside his head (look like mine)
Oh, just like mine
His words so true, oh they're used against him
Oh his children smile because they know he loves them
(Cursing the darkness)
Visions inside his head (look like mine)
Oh, just like mine
Visions inside his head (look like mine)
Oh, just like mine
Yeah
Look back on innocence in vain
Look ahead it's still the same old game
(Cursing the darkness)
Oh visions inside his head (look like mine)
Oh, just like mine
Visions inside his head (look like mine)
Oh, just like mineEmbed
