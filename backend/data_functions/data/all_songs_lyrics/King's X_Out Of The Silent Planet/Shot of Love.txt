Shot of Love LyricsSee the bread, see the wine
See the graft into the vine
This is what is to be
It always made sense to me
Send us a shot of love
(Across the mountains to the sea)
From the poles of north and south
(Wherever we may be)
Send us a shot of love
(Across the mountains to the sea)
From the poles of north and south
(Wherever we may be)
Sometimes my cup is empty
My wish that it stay full
'Cause I am always thirsty
I can't get enough of you
Send us a shot of love
(Across the mountains to the sea)
From the poles of north and south
(Wherever we may be)
Send us a shot of love
(Across the mountains to the sea)
From the poles of north and south
(Wherever we may be)
There is nowhere else to go
(There is nothing else to do)
There is nowhere else to turn
(The first and last is you)
Here I am
Here I am oh
Oh I hear the music
Oh I need a brand new song
'Cause my hearing is so weak, you see
Help me and sing along, ooh
Send us a shot of love
(Across the mountains to the sea)
From the poles of north and south
(Wherever we may be)
Send us a shot of love
(Across the mountains to the sea)
From the poles of north and south
(Wherever we may be)
Send us a shot of love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
