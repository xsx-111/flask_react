Everglade LyricsGlade told her ma
"Home scene's lame
I gotta go head into town
Blow some steam at the rock show"
Sneak through the back door
And head for the pit
Then some drunk, stupid bruiser
Started giving her shit
Rednecks on parade
"Don't cross my line," says Everglade
Everglade
He was whipping through the pit
Knocked her into the stage
She said, "Have your fun
But stop being so lame"
The guy was drunk stupid
And he must have weighed a ton
Said, "Get outta here, girlie
"I'm just trying to have some fun"
So you wanna have some fun?
Well, break out the big guns
Rednecks on parade
"Don't cross my line," says Everglade
Yeah, Everglade
Yeah, Everglade
He kept it up
His fists started flying
They dodged each punch
As he kept trying
Tripped on his own feet
And hit the floor
Glade got to pushing
And rolled him out the door
So you wanna have some fun?
Well, break out the big guns
Rednecks on parade
"Don't cross my line," says Everglade
Says Everglade
Says Everglade
Yeah, Everglade1Embed
