Diet Pill LyricsMy diet pill is wearing off
My diet pill is wearing off
'Cause Victor's in the bed
Sewn in the sheets with thread
The twins are in the car
The frying pan is red
Calgon can't take me away
No, Calgon can't take me away
From the things I did today
'Cause Victor's in the bed
Sewn in the sheets with thread
The twins are in the car
The frying pan is red
And I'm outta here
I'm so outta here
I'm outta here
I think the swelling is going down
I said, I think that the swelling is going down
Two hundred dollars to leave this town
'Cause Victor's in the bed
Sewn to the sheets with thread
The twins are in the car
The frying pan is red
And I'm outta here
I'm so outta here
I'm outta here1Embed
