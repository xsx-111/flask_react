Wargasm LyricsWargasm, wargasm, one, two, three
Tie a yellow ribbon around the amputee
Masturbate, watch it on TV
Crocodile tears for the refugee
Wargasm, wargasm, one, two, three
Smutty bloody pictures, ecstasy
Blue balls waiting impatiently
From Alcatraz to Lady Liberty
Body bags and dropping bombs
The Pentagon knows how to turn us on
Wargasm, wargasm, one, two, three
People, people, ecstasy
Wave those flags high in the air
As long as it takes place over there
Wargasm
Wargasm
Wargasm
Wargasm
Body bags and dropping bombs
The pentagon knows how to turn us, turn us on
Wargasm
Turn us on
