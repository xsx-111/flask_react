One More Thing LyricsI've just 'bout had enough
I'm drowning from too much stuff
I get scared when the telephone rings
Someone complaining about one more thing

One more thing
Yeah it's one more thing
One more thing to put in line
One more thing to waste my time
One more thing that i can't take
One more thing and i'm gonna break
You need more, well get in line
Too many things grabbin' at my time
Tell your brother right out flat
Then I'll have to throw your badge

One more thing
Yeah you're one more thing
Yeah you're one more thing to put in line
One more thing to waste my time
One more thing that i can't take
One more thing and I'm gonna break
Yeah you're one more thing
Yeah, you're one more thing
Fix my engine and the tire goes flat
It's one more thing that I can't have
Politics messing with my rights
There's nothing fun to do tonight

One more thing, it's one more thing
It's one more thing to put in line
One more thing to waste my time
One more thing that I can't take
One more thing and I'm gonna break
It's one more thing... it's one more thing
It's one more thing... it's one more thingEmbed
