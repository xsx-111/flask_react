Monster LyricsCome on over
It's getting late
It's time to fish
No time to cut bait
Ghoulish passion you inspire
With your kind of trouble
I'll never tire
Monster
(monster in me)
Bring out the monster
(monster in me)
Monster
(monster in me)
Bring out the monster
(monster in me)
You bring out
The monster in me
In a world full of disposable icons
All the jokers with the phony come-ons
I know I can depend on you
Cause when we're together, we're hurtin' crew
We don't need to look for trouble
My partner in crime, my insanity double
When life takes a turn from bad to worse
You're always there, my loveable curseEmbed
