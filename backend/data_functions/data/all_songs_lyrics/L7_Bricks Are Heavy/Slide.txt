Slide LyricsI put your stuff out on the porch
(letting it slide)
You pissed in your pants and put out the torch
(letting it slide)
You splattered the bathroom with your hair dye
(letting it slide)
Im kicking you out and you know why
Yeah, I've been letting it slide
You've been along for the ride
You put your cane right through my amp
(letting it slide)
When it comes to losers, you're the champ
(letting it slide)
From my garden, Ill pull your weed
(letting it slide)
Your stupid evil, I will not feed
NO!
Yeah, I've been letting it slide
You've been along for the ride
Yeah, I've been letting it slide
You've been along for the ride
I put your stuff out on the porch
(letting it slide)
You pissed in your pants and put out the torch
(letting it slide)
You splattered the bathroom with your hair dye
(letting it slide)
Im kicking you out and you know why
Yeah, I've been letting it slide
You've been along for the ride
Yeah, I've been letting it slide
You've been along for the ride
Get out of here boy
It took me three weeks to clean that bathroom
You know that amps don't grow on treesEmbed
