Somewhere Else LyricsHome and away
Life goes on the same, bury the pain
And hold on to love
Heal the song, sing along
But what does it change
Oh this life is so confusing
Feels like I'm always losing
Come in knowing everything
But don't say a word, till they teach you the way
Words are found too close to the edge
That we don't dare sing
This will turn into something else, something else
And when it does, I'll be somewhere else, somewhere else
Where else?
And you said I should be myself
Despite all the wrong, dragging you back
Forgive and then forgone and on and on and on and on
This life is so confusing
Feels like I'm always losing
And this'll turn into something else, something else
But when it does, I'll be somewhere else, somewhere else
Where else?Embed
