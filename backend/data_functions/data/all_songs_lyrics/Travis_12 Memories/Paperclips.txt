Paperclips LyricsPaperclips, melody
Hold together all these memories
Memories, memories
I don't wanna think at all
I don't wanna be like you anymore
I don't wanna see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't wanna be like you anymore, anymore, anymore
Take a trip, down memory lane
You will never wanna go again
Take your leave , take your leave
I don't wanna sing at all
I don't wanna be like you anymore
I don't wanna see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't wanna be like you anymore, anymore, anymore
Ever talk, decide out
We get by, we'll get by
And I won't take this
No more sadness, no, no
Paperclips, memories
Hold together all these melodies
Melodies, melodies
I don't wanna sing at all
I don't wanna be like you anymore
I don't wanna see your face at my door
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure
I don't wanna live like you anymore, anymore, anymoreEmbed
