Love Will Come Through LyricsIf I told you a secret you won't tell a soul
Will you hold it and keep it alive
Cause it's burning a hole and I can't get to sleep
And I can't live alone in this life
So look up, take it away
Don't look da-da-da-down the mountain
If the world isn't turning your heart won't return
Anyone, anything, anyhow
So take me, don't leave me
Take me, don't leave me
Baby, love will come through
It's just waiting for you
And you stand at the crossroads of highroads and low roads
And I've got a feeling it's right
If it's real what I'm feeling and there's no make believing
The sound of the wings of the flight
Of a dove, take it away
Don't look da-da-da-down the mountain
If the world isn't turning your heart won't return
Anyone, anything, anyhow
So take me, don't leave me
Take me, don't leave me
Baby, love will come through
It's just waiting for you
Oh, look up, take it away
Don't look da-da-da-down
If the world isn't turning your heart won't return
Anyone, anything and anyhow
So take me, don't leave me
Take me, don't leave me
Baby, love will come through
It's just waiting for you
Love will come through
Love will come through
Love will come through1Embed
