Quicksand LyricsTake me away, take me away
You said that you were gonna stay
But you're always lying anyway
You're gonna suffer if you don't start breathing
Now
Now that I need you
You're going away
Every day, sinking in the quicksand
Follow me down the drain
But it doesn't matter anyway
You're gonna get yours any day
And why you put the blame on me?
If you could only see yourself as others see
Now that I need you
You're going insane
Every day, sinking in the quicksand
Follow me down the drain
Every day, drinking in the same bar
Drowning my sorrows away
Take me away, take me today
Or I'm never gonna get away
But it makes no difference to me
It's just the sound of one more rock star bleeding
Now
Now that I need you
You're out of the frame
Day by day, sinking in the quicksand
Follow me down the drain
Every day, drinking in the same bar
Make mine the same againEmbed
