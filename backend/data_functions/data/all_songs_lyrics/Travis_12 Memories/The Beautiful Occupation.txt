The Beautiful Occupation LyricsDon't just stand there watching it happening
I can't stand it
Don't feel it
Something telling me
Don't wanna go out this way
But have a nice day
Then read it in the headlines
Watch it on the TV
Put it in the background
Stick it in the back
Stick it in the back
For the beautiful occupation
The beautiful occupation
You don't need an invitation
To drop in upon a nation
I'm too cynical
I'm just sitting here
I'm just wasting my time
Half a million civilians gonna die today
But look the wrong way
Then read it in the headlines
Watch it on the TV
Put it in the background
Stick it in the back
Stick it in the back
For the beautiful occupation
The beautiful occupation
You don't need an invitation
To drop in upon a nation
Don't just stand there
Watching it happening
I can't feel it
Don't need this
Something telling me
I don't wanna go out this way
But have a nice day
Then read it in the headlines
Watch it on the TV
Put it in the background
Stick it in the back
Stick it in the back
For the beautiful occupation
The beautiful occupation
You don't need an invitation
To drop in upon a nation
The beautiful occupation
The beautiful occupation
So much for an intervention
Don't call the United NationsEmbed
