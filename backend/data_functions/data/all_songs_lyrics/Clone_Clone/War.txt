War Lyrics
The Extent Is Specific
Precise & Absolute
Equivocal Beholder
I Watch The Carga Cook
Apparitions
Impaling Hallucinations
A Vision Was To Hit
An Addict With Termination
Potent
And Capable Of Sin
Ese Like A Malillon
The Mission Is Un-Ending
Extremities
At The Final Stages
Extortion
Evil Spell Incantation
Anguish
The Heart Becomes Tragic
Battle In The Mind
Evildoer Telepathic
Over The Hills
Hold Up Unveil
Vatos Break Down
At The Gates Of Hell
Stipulated For Disclosure
My Sorcery Expands
Vatos Are Exposed
To Be Ratas In The Past
Detected
Just Like A I Expected
Endless Eternal
A Burning Inferno
Sometimes It Seemed
Like The War Would Never End
But The Guerra Went On
Again & Again
Hit Every Varrio
From The West To The East
Doing It For My Homeboys
That's Resting In Peace

Can't Get It Out My Head
Its Stuck In My Mente
I Visualize The Carga
Ese Sitting In The Ere
I Go In To A Trance
My Eyes Weigh A Ton
Elevation Is The Issue
There's Work To Be Done
Soulless Assassins
They Got Evil Ways
They Murder In The Night
And Rob In The Day
Chales!
Ese Too Many Tragedies
The Calles Ain't No Joke
You Gotta Have Some Strategy
Mi Destino
I Make Mine Forthcoming
A Wicked Ass Harpero
Mi Barrio Es Primero
All My Counterparts
Face Suffocation
Violent Deaths
From The Constant Confrontations
On The Serio
Back To Back Retaliation
Jealousy's a Fact
Of My Present Location
Los Angeles
And My Wound Is Eternal
Enemigas Get Shot Up
In This Burning Inferno
Sometimes It Seemed
Like The War Would Never End
But The Guerra Went On
Again & Again
Hit Every Varrio
From The West To The East
Doing It For My Homeboys
That's Resting In Peace

Whats Up Perro?
Whats Up Conejo?
You Wanna Go To The Homeboys Velorio?
Simon Let Me Get Ready
Alright Ese I'll Pick You Up
Choco R.I.P
R.I.P
Alrato

Pandemonium
Is What Many Would Say
From The Battles In The Past
To The Vatos In The Grave
Typhoon
A World Of Temptation
I Do Damage
And That's My Compensation
Unobservant
Ese Whatâ€™s It Gonna Take?
To Stay On Our Toes
Another Homeboy Goes
This Is Dedicated To The Homeboys
Rest In Peace
Soldados From The Varrio
That Where Killed On The Streets
En Los Ojos De Mi Jefa
She Sees No Threat
In The Eyes Of Conejo
Ese All I See Is Death
My Intent
Is To Patrol The Ache
And Catch Vatos Slippin'
Ese Thinking We Ain't Nada
So Ponle Pues
Loco Let's Go
We Gotta Show Them Putos
Que Mi Barrio No Es Un Juego
Y Mi Historia Se Acaba
Con Estas Palabras
Ese Watch Your Back
Cause It All Comes Back
Sometimes It Seemed
Like The War Would Never End
But The Guerra Went On
Again & Again
Hit Every Varrio
From The West To The East
Doing It For My Homeboys
That's Resting In PeaceEmbed
