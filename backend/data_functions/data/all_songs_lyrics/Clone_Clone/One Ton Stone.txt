One Ton Stone Lyrics
Todos smacked back, I'm from that big bad Hache
All my enemigas on the serio better watch it
And perhaps the outcome is fatal
I come across your land like a fucking tornado
For a bloque in my varrio, you vatos wanna die?
I guess you get your wish and you don't have to try
Cause I does the damage with the vatos from my clique
So ese ask around about the mentally sick
All bitches rattle, ese ask me how I know
I'll take you to the realm of all the unforgiven
I enter the arena for a battle that's so fierce
I feel needle pierce, no one interferes
Cause I run into these vatos, ese all of the time
I grab the automatic, eliminate their mind
I stir up a potion of many evil spells
Loco ass Conejo, ese from the gates of Hell

My rhyme drop down like a One Ton Stone
Gangster ass vato, ese like Al Capone
My rhyme drop down like a One Ton Stone
Gangster ass vato, ese like Al Capone

Wedge in between the madness was killing him
Sometimes, I think you will have to kill someone
Block out the fear then block out the pain
I do my perro in and it's driving me insane
The problem is complex, vatos gettin' checked
And no one could tell, ese what would come next
I'm goin' for the ride, my faith is in your hands
Couldn't sleep a second, my destiny was planned
It's a power struggle and who would control it
This bone crushing perro becomes my only component

Wassup Perro
Que Onda, Conejo Trix
I just got out, que rola un primo, que no?
Better yet, some carga
Where's all the homies at? Let's go to 25th, que no?

My visions are clear, no longer in a blur
Waiting for the moment, that something would occur
I'm going in this cycle, again and again
I'm living in this world, that's so full of sin
So I dodge and dive, or else I be devoured
Strolling the yarda, ese staring at the tower
I block out the pain and block out the fear
And after the laughter, came down a tear
My rhyme drop down like a One Ton Stone
Gangster ass vato, ese like Al Capone
My rhyme drop down like a One Ton Stone
Gangster ass vato, ese like Al Capone
And I'm outEmbed
