Eternal LyricsRetaliation is the only thing on my mind
And robbery and murder would be the only type of crime
Trapped and isolated, as the leviathan grins
The leviathan is satan and is also the evil within

Eternal is the battle I will fight
And kill anybody that crosses my sight
Eternal is the battle I will fight
And kill anybody that crosses my sight

Incidentally, evil spirits wicked demons
I rise up on the gates to create a disappearance
For they have declared, war on my barrio
War on the calles, where I gang fucking diario
On the serio, in a uncertain manner
When I step with a gauge ese, all the vatos scatter
I enforce, the full amount of violence
Mi barrio controla, so don’t even try it
What’s up Bandido? Go get the getaway ranfla
While I take this little trip down the bloqué
This is my barrio and by no means will a takeover occur

Kick off the riot, my army is immense
Let’s get to battle, take this fierro to the neck
And check, and now I collect
Low down Conejo, my name is a threat
Danger peligro, unauthorized area
Keep the gates locked or I tax for the feria
Anything you own, I’ll take all your gold
In other words I’m saying that I’ll even take your soul
Eternal is the battle I will fight
And kill anybody that crosses my sight
Eternal is the battle I will fight
And kill anybody that crosses my sight

She was black as night, and turn into liquid
No one complies cause the dragon is so wicked
Vatos got shocked, electro devices
Maybe they don’t know of my many disguises
8 thousand tons of T.N.T, I’ll blow your ass up strategically
You see I kill all the vatos that were after me
The bullets rang out with velocity
The bi-symmetrical line, one part of your mind
I caught your ass sleeping, so awake to this nine
And do as I say or off with your head
Amid evil battle, a duel to the death
Quickly, grab the weapon of your choice
An axe, a knife, a lance, a sword, I punish
I was tempted by the devil, to do this vato in
And take my mind into another level

Eternal
In this burning inferno
Eternal
In this burning inferno
(That’s on the ache)
Eternal is the battle I will fight
And kill anybody that crosses my sight
Bandido get the getaway car
Cause I dropped this vato at the end of the blockEmbed
