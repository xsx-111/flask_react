Eight Million Stories Lyrics
Five years pass, no more wilas
Their all coming down cus my perro's out the pinta
Did a soleta, times ain't changed
This vatos de la area wanna play war games
Bang bang bang enemigas gotta fall
Take out anybody, that says they saw
Along time waiting, and now your home
Let's regulate this calles like ah deadly cyclone
But before anything let me get you this ruca
Relieve all your tension. aticual attention
Dos uno tres, I'm quivalent to dope
Ah gramo of carga and ah gramo of coke
Todo smack back I'm from that big bad hache
Ese una treinta ocho, that only I could touch it
Conejo, I'm that Killer From The West
Matando enemigas ese puro Los Angeles

Eight million stories (in the City of Angels)
Eight million stories (in the City of Angels)

Tonight, there's gonna be a volo
At my homeboys canton and I drove up solo
There's drogas, and a lot of wicked women
Twelve O'clock came and I turn into ah demon
Damn ese, the homies getting deep
And no enemigas dare come down my street
We got the big guns, and deadly is my style
Enter at a risk and I'll make it worth your while
That's right ese, all Pachuco down
Low down Conejo from the tiny loco's town
Long black hair she was wicked in the eyes
Sorcery was strong that she had me hypnotized
But chales, I got my own path
I feed on destruction, pain makes me laugh
Conejo, I'm that killer from the West
Matando enemigas, ese puro Los Angeles
Eight million stories, in the City of Angels
Eight million stories, in the City of Angels

There's a meeting at the parke today at noon
The vatos from my time, are all doing time
A lot of new faces, joined the clica
I busted out a camera, and took ah flica
Some of us here won't see tomorrow
Some to the joint and some straight to the grave
Regardless, I'ma go for the ride
Everyday that I live, in my gangster life
Eight million stories (in the City of Angels)
Eight million stories (in the City of Angels)Embed
