Fatal Dream Lyrics
Whats Up Little Homie
You Get In The Barrio?
It's Now Or Never Ese

Youngster On The Go
Obstructions Of The Mind
I Chose To Persuade
Ese The Hard Fucking Times
Forewarned
But The Warning Is Too Late
Like The Concept Of Time
A Sequence Of Change
Assumptions
That You Can't Affirm
Enemigas Plead For Mercy
But They Don't Get Hurt
I Premiere A Whimier
That Gets Me Panicking
That Gots Me Fucking Loco
With My Perro In The Rear
I Approach
With Assortment Of Skills
That Gates Have Been Opened
For The Purpose To Kill
Inagration
I Run My Transactions
Vatos Can't Function
After All The Interaction
Bombardment
From This Rain Of Terror
The Clouds They Gathered
Ese Demons Battle Angels
At The Gates Of Hell
Vatos Got Booked
And A Simple Mistake
Is All That It Took
There's Work To Be Done
Expect The Unexpected
In A Matter Of Seconds
I Get Satanic
Diabolic
Ese To The Extreme
I'm Born In To This World
I'm Having Fatal Dreams

They Blocked Off The Area
They're Ready To Attack
An Alleged 2-11
Is Riding On My Back
I Did Damage
Un Chingo De Jales
La Mera Neta Es
Que All Bitches Rattle
My Descent
Is Of An Aztec Drum
Well Known For The Murders
Of The Calles Up In Los
Operational
Stated From The Top
That Those Who Intrude
Acupuncture Till They Drop
Circumstances
Drove Up To The Condado
Waited For The Chain
I Got To The Estado
Shot A Wila To My Perro
I'm Short To The Can't√≥n
A Lot Of New Faces
The Homeboy Overdosed
That's Right
Ese Vine Acabarte
I Bust A Kamikaze
Solo Par Agarrar Te
And According
To The Battles In The Past
My Total Concentration
And A Spell I Would Cast
There's Work To Be Done
Expect The Unexpected
In A Matter Of Seconds
I Get Satanic
Diabolic
Ese To The Extreme
I'm Born In To This World
I'm Having Fatal Dreams

Did A Little Tiempo
Put A Taca On My Neck
I Seen The Camaradas
I Spoke The Dialect
Had A Brainstorm
Ese Equal To Destruction
I Follow My Orders
To Commence With Corruption
Soy Loco Trix
2-1-3 - 2-11
And Ain't No Fucking Way
That I'm Going Up To Heaven
I'm Going Right Down
Pass The Gates Of Hell
You'll See My Placaso
Conejo Was Here
Everything You Heard
About My Barrio Is True
Enemigas Quiren Guerra
Enemigas Catch The Blues
Duplication
So The Murder I Distribute
Y Todo Paniciado
Is The Outcome That I Give You
A Black Magic Women
I Encounter In My Way
Pumping Through My Brain
The Rush Of Cocaine
The Killer From The West
A Rider On The Storm
A Total Eclipse
And My Mind Starts To Form
There's Work To Be Done
Expect The Unexpected
In A Matter Of Seconds
I Get Satanic
Diabolic
Ese To The Extreme
I'm Born In To This World
I'm Having Fatal DreamsEmbed
