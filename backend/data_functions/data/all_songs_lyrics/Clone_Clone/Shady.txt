Shady Lyrics
Pure uncut Heroin

I react, I attack
Enemigas they collapse like carga, it's that needle in my vein
Pumping through my system, going straight to my brain
En loquera, ese that be my choice
I know you could tell by the tone of my voice
That I'm panicked, I rob the connection
I stay on my toes in every direction
The South, the East, especially the West
Cause the vatos in the West will put a fierro through my chest
So let me go get this automatic weapon
And give these malillones a little fucking lesson
Cause they must’ve thought that I’d be alone
Surrounded by these Harpys, pulling in the panic zone
And my method is of deadly illusions
Conjuring up a spell of a deadly execution
It's no stoppin' & we shockin'
To see your perro droppin'
It was all a maze, just another phase
The vatos of disciple and I come like a beast
I’m all like anesthetic cause too long I’ve been a thief
I’m roaming in the shadows and vatos can't locate me
I’m roaming in the shadows and vatos can't locate me
I’m looking for my perro, the one that they call Shady
I’m roaming in the shadows and vatos can't locate me
I’m looking for my perro, the one that they call Shady

No me conoces and yet you wants to battle
I guess I'll bust a grape and watch these snake ass vatos rattle
Soy Conejo from the western days
When the sun goes down, I show my wicked ways
Have you ever been so panicked in this paranoid dimension
The tensions runnin' high, a critical situation
Snap out your dream, you gots to take action
As I dip this fucking frajo in some chemical reaction
Anything que quieras, enemy in sight
My perros got my back loco, all through the night
Pero esto no se va quedar asi
Cause just like the rest I'll have these vatos R-I-P

I’m roaming in the shadows and vatos can't locate me
I’m looking for my perro, the one that they call Shady
I’m roaming in the shadows and vatos can't locate me
I’m looking for my perro, the one that they call Shady
25th was the calle on a dark, lonely night
And Los is the location where your enemy just might
Come out the shadows, I heard this vato hates me
Plus the vato wants to get me for fucking with his lady
Told him all bitches rattle, pense que lo sabias
Like drogas on the calles, these hynas get malillas
I stepped in a canton, they recognized my face
I see it's no escape through the gates with no trace
So where you at carnal?
Am I the only one to hear it?
Could it be in my mind hearing dead homie spirits
Or is it cause I lost it?
Or could it be the devil?
I'm in a mental trap on a subconscious level

I’m roaming in the shadows and vatos can't locate me
30 with the "L" is what they gave my perro Shady
I’m roaming in the shadows and vatos can't locate me
30 with the "L" is what they gave my perro Shady

And this is dedicated to my carnal, Shady Boy
Deadly Status
Yo soy Conejo Trix, the gates of Hell
Muerto Fin Gang
And all bitches rattle
(Because He knows just what’s going down)1Embed
