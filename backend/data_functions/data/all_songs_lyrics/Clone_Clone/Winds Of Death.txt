Winds Of Death Lyrics
(1, 2 - Veneno's Coming For You)
There's Many Kind Of Winds
Some Come From The Sky
(There's Poison In The Air)
Others Come From Hell
No Where To Run
No Repel
So Be Aware
Before They Blow On You

I Run With The Harpyanos
Cemetery Landscapers
So Don't Play With Gangsters
Like Me You're Playing With Fire
An Arsonist Desire
To Remain In Chains
In Inferno  Flames
My Strong Mental Irritation
These Victims
With Painful Deadly Inflammations
Like A Shot - Gun
And Pellets To The Chest
I Blow Lyrics
Like The Winds Of Death
Eventually You'll Suffer
Great Amount Of Casualties
Rapidly
Vatos Are Dropping
Death Is Increasing
Blue & I'm Feeling Like A Savage
To Run Through The Calles
Ese I Manage
In The Loudness Hay Violence
Muerto Fill You With Silence
The Winds Of Death
Will Blow On Those
Who Disturb The Gates
Of Hell
Death Will Become You
Even If You Try
To Run & Repel
Enemigos Don't Give A Fuck
About Veneno
So I Determine
Me Tengo Que Cuidar
Everywhere That I'm At
Before The Winds Blow On Me
So I Disturb The Peace
My Madness Never Cease
Violentamente I Increase
To Be Exactly
Putos Get Demolished
Dramatically
Bodies Get Devoured
Receiving Cruel
And Unusual Punishment
Retirement
Aye Conejo Garra El Tuerno
Wassup? Smoking Enemigas
Like A Primo To The Head
(1, 2 - Veneno's Coming For You)
Let The Winds Blow On Them
Let The Winds Blow On Them
Los Harpys
(There's Poison In The Air)

Excavating Great Amount
Of Suffering
With Wickedness & Sickness
Its A Wave Of Crime
Impossible To Decline
Like The Winds Of Death Blow
Disturb The Gates And You'll Know
Get Locked In Hell
Nowhere To Run Or Repel
With Swiftness I Rise
Remarkable & Motionless
And Poisonous
Like A Snake
But I Don't Rattle
I'm Brushing Up Skills
For A Frugal Battle
Astromundus Armed Forces
Ripped Through Your Bloque
La Guerra Continúa
Día y Noche
Como Tormenta Poderosa
Mi Barrio Destrosa
Enemigos Don't Disturb Us
For Any Reason What So Ever (Chales)
My Fractrous Flock
Is No Surprise
And Its Staying Here Forever
The Winds Of Death
Will Blow On Those
Who Disturb The Gates Of Hell
Death Will Become You
The Winds Of Death Will Blow On Those
Who Disturb The Gates Of Hell
Death Will Become You
Even If You Try
To Run & Repel
Let Em Blow
Let Em Blow
Let Em Blow

They Can't Decline My Varrio
(1, 2 - Veneno's Coming For You)
You Know Why?
(There's Poison In The Air)
Cause All The Enemigos Are Dead In My Eyes
(1, 2 - Veneno's Coming For You)Embed
