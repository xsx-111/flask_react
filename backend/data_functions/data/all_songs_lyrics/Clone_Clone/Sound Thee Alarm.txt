Sound Thee Alarm Lyrics
Down from the skies came this Harpy's eagle
Sent out on a mission to contemplate some evil
I engage in a battle, define eliminate
I confound everybody to a realm that devastates
I'm flawless and my absence so mysterious
Vatos wanna know why my actions are so furious
The fuse, no tienes tiempo to delay
Or time to disagree, just time to disengage
I destroy anyone, enemigas get deleted
My army is deployed, your varrio is defeated
I hold the only key to the gates of Hell
In other words te mato, my mind is the cell
Enact is exactly what I do
My vital capacity, you lit the fucking fuse
Evicted and you best to recoil
I'm here to reinstate and bring this new order

Sound thee alarm, enemigas wanna ride
Flat line when the pressure was applied
Sound thee alarm, enemigas wanna ride
Flat line when the pressure was applied

They say that we're a myth but this myth don't unravel
Vatos they get murdered in the middle of the battle
Run fighting alas like the Western flicks
These conniving times, I need my daily fix
I start dozing off, I get so sleepy
I keep myself awake cause these vatos wanna stick me
In the shadows, ese welcome to my dreams
Welcome to your doom, the Harpy Saloon
Sub-zero weather, ese armies they collide
For pleito in the past, all the youngsters die
Muerte is not the issue, enemigas rest in piss
The visions of deception, constantly persist
My scriptures engraved in a scroll
Protected by the demons, the story unfolds
I was loaded, the dragon as he enters
I teleport myself, de volada to the center
Sound thee alarm, enemigas wanna ride
Flat line when the pressure was applied
Sound thee alarm, enemigas wanna ride
Flat line when the pressure was applied

Aye que onda?
Que onda con todos los homies?
I just got a wila from Shady Boy
He's up in Mill Creek 4 yard
And Spanky's up in Corcoran doing a SHU program
Tu sabes homie, aqui para los Harpy's

They can't penetrate us, ese my style is immortal
I get malillon when I step through the portal
I see vatos burnin', I also see them fallin'
All over the Ã¡rea, enemigas they be crawling
It's fatal like lava from volcanoes
Your blood then boils to an infinite inferno
Do you see me laughing?
Do you see me telling jokes?
Vatos they get smoked in a matter of a tokes
You go through my notes, reading every page
Like the Phantom of The Opera, my mind is the stage
I still watch 'em burn, no one could ever tell
Revelations were foretold so time would only tell
The ordeal in these turbulent shades
Vatos got torcidos when the juras threw a raid
They slayed anyone in their path
Ese, hablo de mi barrio, I come in their behalf
Sound thee alarm, enemigas wanna ride
Flat line when the pressure was applied
Sound thee alarm, enemigas wanna ride
Flat line when the pressure was appliedEmbed
