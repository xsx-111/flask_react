My Mind Just Erupted Lyrics
All my enemigas turn to ash
When I break it on these putos, this automatic stash
My rhyme drop down like a One Ton Stone
Gangster ass vato, ese like Al Capone
Vatos disappear like I was doing magic
Sleeping like a baby, it was death in the cradle
Can't figure out my ways, some say suicidal
The way that I react to me it's fucking vital
Cause all my elements ain't ordinary
La calle veinticinco, my status is deadly
Conejo Trix, I'm from that Muerto Fin gang
Ese, all bitches rattle and I trust no man
So come into my realm, my fearful domain
It's just like a speed wall, carga, cocaine
You get a fucking rush as you enter my dimension
Heroin kicks in, relieves all the tension

My mind just erupted like a volcanic eruption
Me plus a cuete equals total destruction
My mind just erupted like a volcanic eruption
Me plus a cuete equals total destruction

Surprise, surprise, ese open your eyes
Loc'd out Conejo, I be that devil in disguise
Cause what can make you laugh, can also make you cry
I'm from that big bad hache and simon I'm down to die
Todo psycho, I'm flaco from the piedras that I smoke
I toke and I choke, it's my victims that get broke
Fatal with the wounds to make a vato break
Despite all the madness, regardless of my faith
On a dark stormy night when evils all around
Echos on my voice be the only fucking sound
Paniciado and I sense there's betrayal
This diabolic trail my canton where I dwell
The gates have been open I'm the keeper of the gate
In order to pass first you must indicate
A scar, a sign, the number of the beast
En esta dimension, you will never see defeat
My mind just erupted like a volcanic eruption
Me plus a cuete equals total destruction
My mind just erupted like a volcanic eruption
Me plus a cuete equals total destruction

Vatos out there claiming to be hard
But are unprepared and off guard
I said Devil Tree, upon those who fuck with me
What you talk about, it's just plain talk
Ese, lets take a walk
Let me review from happiness
Mischievous I infest, in the path of no return
For sure you will burn, you'll stumble and crumble
Then you'll get disposed, amarrado condado
I'm still al malvado, so ese cuidado
1, 2, Veneno's coming for you
3, 4, you fell into a hole
5, 6, you snitched like a bitch
7, 8, I extirpate like motivate
My flow ain't giver, I do post a trigger
The way I illustrate makes you hesitate
My method of destruction is to eradicate
No toleration for the enemy dictation
Again extermination of the enemigos
That took that risk now there face gots a wiz
My venom showers with immense powers
Undistracted, my mind just erupted
My mind just erupted like a volcanic eruption
Me plus a cuete equals total destruction
My mind just erupted like a volcanic eruption
Me plus a cuete equals total destruction1Embed
