Conejo Lyrics
Sun down, in the months of autumn
He's a homie from my varrio, I knew everything about him
He had cora and he always knew the hora
His own little reasons why el varrio controla
Mi respeto for this firme camarada
Down for the cause, que nunca se acabada
Los Ángeles, la área dos trece
Enemigas get shot up and everyday is a lesson
But little did he know of what was to come
Unaware he was destined to get shot with a gun
Consequences for roaming in the streets
And Russian Roulette when you want to play for keeps
Is it really how they say cause it happens all the time
At the wrong place, ese at the wrong time
That's how it's going down, the times have changed
No one knew who did it and the reason wasn't strange

Conejo, you better watch your back
Cause these vatos out to get you and stab you in the back
On the serio, ese can't even sleep
Cause before I really knew it, I was in too deep

I see life but time's running out
I summon the demons but only I can see them
My assistants in the journey I must take
Expect the unexpected is what I await
Then I teleport myself like a thought from my head
Into his mind to find out what happened
My diabolic status, ese lead me to the killer
He seen my homeboy slipping, so he had to pull the trigger
This vato used gloves, this vato used a mask
He shot him in the chest, no one heard the blast
Then back to his varrio, a jale well done
Got rid of his ropa and buried his gun
I got to escape, my time is also running out
Me tengo que pelar o voy a quebrar
So perro, you know me better than that
I'm a straight malion and the hache's where it's at
Conejo, you better watch your back
Cause these vatos out to get you and stab you in the back
On the serio, ese can't even sleep
Cause before I really knew it, I was in too deep

I embark on the voyage I must take
I put on my armor, ese fortify the base
And in case, I weren't to come back
Venenoso peligroso, automatic with attack
He knows that I'm coming, He knows who I am
From the murders on his homies of the times in the past
Mentally, I was ready for the ride
And ready for destruction, ese high in the sky
Like a vulture, it's in my Aztec culture
My devilish attempts to impose some torture
My instrument of death, I show no remorse
I got out the car and entered with force
I was quicker on the draw, this vato has to pay
In between the eyes, In between the legs
My mission's accomplished, the vato got taxed
Enemigas out to get me until then I relax

Conejo, you better watch your back
Cause these vatos out to get you and stab you in the back
On the serio, ese can't even sleep
Cause before I really knew it, I was in too deepEmbed
