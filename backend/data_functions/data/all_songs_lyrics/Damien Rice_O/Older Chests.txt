Older Chests Lyrics
Older chests reveal themselves
Like a crack in a wall
Starting small
And grow in time
And we always seem to need the help
Of someone else
To mend that shelf
Too many books
Read me your favorite line
Papa went to other lands
And he found someone who understands
The ticking
The Western Man's need to cry
He came back the other day, yeah you know
Some things in life may change
And some things
They stay the same

Like time
There's always time
On my mind
So pass me by
I'll be fine
Just give me time
Older gents sit on the fence
With their cap in hand
Looking grand
They watch their city change
Children scream, or so it seems
Louder than before
Out of doors and into stores
With bigger names
Mama tried to wash their faces
But these kids they lost their graces
And daddy lost
At the races too many times
She broke down the other day, yeah you know
Some things in life may change
And some things
They stay the same

Like time
There's always time
On my mind
So pass me by
I'll be fine
Just give me time
Like time
There's always time
On my mind
So pass me by
I'll be fine
Just give me time2Embed
