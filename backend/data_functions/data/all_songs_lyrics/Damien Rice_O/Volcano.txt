Volcano Lyrics
Don't hold yourself like that
You'll hurt your knees
Well I kissed your mouth and back
But that's all I need
Don't build your world around
Volcanoes melt you down

What I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask for the sea

Don't throw yourself like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth, your back
Is that all you need?
Don't drag my love around
Volcanoes melt me down

What I am to you is not real
What I am to you, you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And I'll ask . . 
What I give to you
Is just what I'm going through
This is nothing new, no no
Just another phase of finding
What I really need
Is what makes me bleed
But like a new disease
Lord, she's still too young to treat
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
What I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
And what I am to you (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
Is not real, (she's still too young)
What I am to you, (oh she's still too young)
(I kissed your mouth)
(Volcanoes melt you down)
You do not need (she's still too young)
You do not need me4Embed
