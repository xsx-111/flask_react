Delicate Lyrics
We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody's watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate
So why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why'd you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
We might live like never before
There's nothing to give
Well, how can we ask for more?
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate

So why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why'd you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
Why'd you fill my sorrows
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place that you've known?
Why'd you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
