Amie LyricsNothing unusual, nothing strange
Close to nothing at all
The same old scenario, the same old rain
And there's no explosions here
Then something unusual, something strange
Come from nothing at all
I saw a spaceship fly by your window
Did you see it disappear?

Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
Tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me
Nothing unusual, nothing's changed
Just a little older that's all
You know when you've found it
There's something I've learned
'Cause you feel it when they take it away
Hey hey hey
Something unusual, something strange
Come from nothing at all
But I'm not a miracle
And you're not a saint
Just another soldier
On the road to nowhere
Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
Tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me
Amie, come sit on my wall
And read me the story of O
Tell it like you still believe
That the end of the century
Brings a change for you and me2Embed
