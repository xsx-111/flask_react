Cold Water LyricsCold, cold water
Surrounds me now
And all I've got
Is your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?
Love one's daughter
Allow me that
And I can't let go
Of your hand
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Lord, can you hear me now?
Or am I lost?
Cold, cold water
Surrounds me now
And all I've got
Is your hand
Lord? Can you hear me?
Lord? Can you hear me now?
Lord? Can you hear me?
Lord?
Or am I lost?
Am I lost?
Am I lost?
Am I lost?
Am I lost?
Am I lost?
Am I lost?Embed
