I Remember Lyrics
I remember it well:
The first time that I saw
Your head 'round the door
'Cause mine stopped working
I remember it well:
There was wet in your hair
I was stood in the stairs
And time stopped moving
I want you here tonight, I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
I remember it well:
Taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform
And my ships were sailing
I remember it well:
I was stood in your line
And your mouth, your mouth, your mouth
I want you here tonight, want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down
Except you my love
'Cept you my love

Come, all ye lost
Dive into moss
And hope that my sanity covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
Paper mach√©
Come, all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
I'm driving real hard
This is love, this is porn
God will forgive me
But I
I whip myself with scorn, scorn
I wanna hear
What you have to say about me
Hear
If you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear
What you want
I remember December
I wanna hear
What you have to say about me
Hear
If you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear
What you want
What the hell do you want?5Embed
