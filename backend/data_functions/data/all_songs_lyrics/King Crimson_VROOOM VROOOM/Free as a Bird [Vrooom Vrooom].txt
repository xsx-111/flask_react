Free as a Bird  LyricsFree as a bird, it's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird, home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to the life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch that seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird, it's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird, home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free
Ah
Ah
Ah
Free as a bird, it's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird, free as a bird
Free as a bird
Oooooo, freeEmbed
