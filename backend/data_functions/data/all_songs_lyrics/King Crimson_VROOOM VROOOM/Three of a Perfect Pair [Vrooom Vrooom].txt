Three of a Perfect Pair  Lyrics
She is susceptible
He is impossible
They have their cross to share
Three of a perfect pair

He has his contradicting views
She has her cyclothymic moods
They make a study in despair
Three of a perfect pair

One, one too many schizophrenic tendencies
Keeps it complicated (complicated)
Keeps it aggravated (aggravated)
And full of this hopelessness
What a perfect mess

He has his contradicting views
She has her cyclothymic moods
They make a study in despair
Three of a perfect pair

One, one too many schizophrenic tendencies
Keeps it complicated (complicated)
Keeps it so aggravated (aggravated)
And full of this hopelessness
Oh, what a perfect mess
One, one too many schizophrenic tendencies
Keeps it complicated
Keeps it so aggravated
Full of this hopelessness
Oh, what a perfect mess
One, one too many schizophrenic tendencies
Keeps it complicated (complicated)
Keeps it so aggravated (aggravated)
And full of this hopelessness
Oh, what a perfect messEmbed
