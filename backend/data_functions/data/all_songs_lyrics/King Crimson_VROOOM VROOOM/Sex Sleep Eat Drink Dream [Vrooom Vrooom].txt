Sex Sleep Eat Drink Dream  Lyrics
Sex, sleep, eat, drink, dream

Primal tribal apple egg vegetable eel
I have a new canoe but it does not have a wheel

Sex, sleep, eat, drink, dream
Sex, sleep, eat, drink, dream

Private velvet animal Oldsmobile mind
I'm sitting in the fireplace burning up my time

Sex, sleep, eat, drink, dream


Sex, sleep, eat, drink, dream
Sex, sleep, eat, drink, dream
Sex, sleep, eat, drink, dream

Private velvet animal empty T.V
They're fishing in the kitchen
But they haven't caught up to me
Primal tribal chemical digital night
I've got to get dressed to go out of my mind
Sex, sleep, eat, drink, dreamEmbed
