Best Friend on the Payroll Lyrics
I turn the music down
And I don't know why, this is my house
I turn the music down
And I don't know why, this is my house

The best friend on the payroll
No, no, no, it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out
No, no, no
The best friend on the payroll
Oh, no, no, no, it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out

More breakfast in bed, and I'll bring the paper in later

The best friend on the payroll
Oh, no, no, no, it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out
No, no, no
The best friend on the payroll
Oh, no, no, no, it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out
More breakfast in bed, and I'll bring the paper in later

The best friend on the payroll
No, no, no, it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work out
No, no, no, no
The best friend on the payroll
No, no, no, it's not gonna work out
It's not gonna work outEmbed
