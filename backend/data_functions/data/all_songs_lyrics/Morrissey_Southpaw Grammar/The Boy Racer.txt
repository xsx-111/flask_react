The Boy Racer Lyrics
He's just too good-natured and
He's got too much money and
He's got too many girlfriends
I'm jealous that's all

Have you seen him go, though, oh?
Have you seen him go, though, oh?

Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing
Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

He's got too many girlfriends
He thinks he owns this city
He overspeeds and he never gets pulled over

Have you seen him go, though, oh?
Have you seen him go, though, oh?
Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing
Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

He thinks he got the whole world in his hands
Stood at the urinal
He thinks he got the whole world in his hands
And I'm gonna kill him

Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no

Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing
Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing

He's just too good-looking
He's just too good-looking
He's just too good-looking, and, and, and, and...
Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing
Boy racer
Boy racer, oh
We're gonna kill this pretty thing2Embed
