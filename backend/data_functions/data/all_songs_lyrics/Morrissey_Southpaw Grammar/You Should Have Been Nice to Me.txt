You Should Have Been Nice to Me Lyrics
You could have told me at the right time
You could have introduced me proudly
Never need to have to kiss me
Never need to ever touch me, but

You should have been nice to me
You should have been nice to me
It would have been so easy

And on the moments when I was down
You could have been there, you could have been there
You could have once just spoke in favor
You'd never need to ever touch me, but

You should have been nice to me
You should have been nice to me
It wouldn't cost you money

And on the moments when I fell down
Not for you to say, oh, I told you so
You could have waited, you could have waited
You could have waited2Embed
