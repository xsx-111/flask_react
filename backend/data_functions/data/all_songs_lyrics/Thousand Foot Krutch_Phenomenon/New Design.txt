New Design Lyrics
Wait, I might hesitate
Am I a minute too late?
Please Lord, I need to know
This pressure's got me letting go
If I'm wrong
Will I still carry on and end up where I belong?
I've never felt this way before
I've never come so close
I've never worn so thin
I'm stepping out instead of closing in
I left myself behind when I made up my mind
No turnin' back this time
This is my new design

Sometimes, I feel so alone
It feels like I'm standing out here on my own
I've never felt so far from home
It's comin' on
It hits me when I step outside my zone
'Cause sometimes, I feel so alone
It feels like I'm standing out here on my own
And I've never felt so far from home
It's comin' on
It hits me when I step outside my zone
I see what you're doin' to me
Could have been you so easily
But you look the other way
Even though we were close the other day
And I'm still tryin' to get up this hill
I need you just like a pill
I've never felt this way before
I've never come so close
I've never worn so thin
I'm stepping out instead of closing in
Left myself behind when I made up my mind
No turnin' back this time
This is my new design

Sometimes, I feel so alone
It feels like I'm standing out here on my own
And I've never felt so far from home
It's comin' on
It hits me when I step outside my zone
'Cause sometimes, I feel so alone
It feels like I'm standing out here on my own
I've never felt so far from home
It's comin' on
It hits me when I step outside my zone
(Do ya get the feelin') everything will be alright?
I'm movin'
So pleased to meet you
But I am movin' on
Tried to pass it to another
But it's comin' on
I can't wait to find out
Break me
I can't seem to climb out of this hole
I'm stuck again
If I'm not out in a minute
I'm jumpin' in
Let's start again
I'm sick of this
Let's just get it out
Are ya feelin' it?
Move back
Ya wanna feel how real it is?
Let's just get it out
Are ya feelin' it?
Move back
Ya wanna feel how real it is?

Sometimes, I feel so alone
It feels like I'm standing out here on my own
I've never felt so far from home
It's comin' on
It hits me when I step outside my zone
'Cause sometimes, I feel so alone!Embed
