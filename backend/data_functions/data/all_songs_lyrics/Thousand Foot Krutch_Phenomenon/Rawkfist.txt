Rawkfist Lyrics
Throw up your rawkfist if you're feelin' it when I drop this

Show 'em how we slow this spot
Let 's make it hot
Let's shock 'em with the bodyrock 'til the party stops
It's time to take it up a notch
And keep it locked
For all the headbangers in the parking lot
Here we come
If you're ready or not
No time to talk
Cause we on the clock
Bringin' that uhh
Uhh
To your block
Let me show ya where we're comin' from
It don't stop
From L.A. to New York show me what you got now

All I know
Is what it did take to make this
All I am
Is what it will take to break this
All I know
Is what it did take to make this
All I am
Is what it will take to break this
Light it up now
Light it up now
Try runnin' me down
Keep runnin' around
I'm fakin' you out
Would ya just
Make it what you want it to be
About to find out
What you're all about
I'm callin' you out
Won't ya just
Set me free
Try runnin' me down
Keep runnin' around
I'm fakin' you out
Would ya just
Make it what you want it to be
About to find out
What you're all about
I'm callin' you out
Won't ya just
Set me free

All I know
Is what it did take to make this
All I am
Is what it will take to break this
All I know
Is what it did take to make this
All I am
Is what it will take to break this
Light it up now
Light it up now
Throw up your rawkfist if you're feelin' it when I drop this
That's the sound when the rock hits
Oh, you never know
I might let go
Get ready, get set
Throw up your rawkfist if you're feelin' it when I drop this
That's the sound when the rock hits
Oh, you never know
I might let go
Get ready, get set
That's the sound when the rock hits
That's the sound when the rock hits
That's the sound when the rock hits
Jump, jump!
Make the sound when the rock hits

Throw up your rawkfist if you're feelin' it when I drop this1Embed
