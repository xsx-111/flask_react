Last Words Lyrics
Dear loved one
Please listen
This might be the last chance I get
I'm sorry I left you
I'm living in a world of regret
Don't cry if you can hear me
I never meant to hurt you dearly
I'm so wrong sincerely
Don't stop
Take life seriously

These are the last words I'm ever gonna get to say to you
When everything falls away from you
Take these words and know the world is not worth leaving

There's so much I've done wrong
Since I left it hit me so strong
Take my hand and let's walk through
All the times I've lied and hurt you
Those people
Please love them
Don't hate them
We're not above them
You can have everything but have nothing
Listen I've got to tell you something
These are the last words I'm ever gonna get to say to you
When everything falls away from you
Take these words and know the world is not worth leaving
Last words I'll really get to say to you
So listen very carefully to what I'm saying
Life is more than just the games you're playing (playing, playing)

If there was ever one thing I could ever get across to you
I'd tell you not to say the things you do
And tell my mother that I love her too
No matter what life pulls ya through (no)
You've got what it takes to make it through
And if I was you I'd get down on my knees and pray
Thank God in the morning for another day
Cause these are the

The last words I'm ever gonna get to say to you
When everything falls away from you
Take these words and know the world is not worth leaving
Last words I'll really get to say to you
So listen very carefully to what I'm saying
Life is more than just the games you're playing
Life is more than just the games you're playingEmbed
