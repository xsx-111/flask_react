Phenomenon Lyrics
If you're like us, calling all riders
Roll up beside us, no place to hide us
All freedom fighters, let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous and. Let's. Go
Destination, for navigation
Man up ya station, feel the sensation
Surround invasion, with communication
Move quick, we might avoid contamination

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet
To this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud, let's show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon
Roll, open your soul, maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go, and let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

Don't let these spiders crawl up beside us
They want to bite us, inject the virus
Raise up the lighters, praise to the righteous
We need to guide us, get prepared to go
If you're like us, calling all riders
Roll up beside us, no place to hide us
All freedom fighters, let's unite us
Switch on your nitrous and. Lets. Go
Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet
To this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud, let's show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon
Roll! Open your soul, maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go, and let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon

Can't take it anymore
Shake until we move the floor
What are we waiting for? Let's go!
Tired of being ordinary
Don't care if there's people staring
I'll rely on your strength to carry me on
I'm not invisible like you
Next time things get a little messed up
I'll shine, but I'll never be see through
I'm fine just trying to wake the rest up

Down, here comes the sound
Everyone pound your feet
To this phenomenon
Now let's make it loud, let's show 'em all how
You move to this phenomenon
Roll! Open your soul, maybe lose control
Inside of this phenomenon
Just let yourself go, and let everyone know
You move to this phenomenon
You move to this phenomenon
You move to this phenomenon5Embed
