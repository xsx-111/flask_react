Quicken Lyrics
I've got things that make me feel unordinary
Not necessarily in need of therapy
Bit I know things have been slipping, loosening my grip
How much closer until I'm bound to hit the ground
Sound the alarm
But remain calm
My time is drawn
Never meant to cause anyone no harm
This time things will be different, I promise
I really promise

And this time things will be different
And it grows and grows and grows

'Cause it's the way we talk
The way we walk
The way your words connect my thoughts
The way we move
The way we stand
The way our world is in your hands
My life's just like a prison
We shout but no one listens
We're set
All in position
Use us
Take us
Break us!
Questions running through my mind
I'm falling behind
I never would have guessed this could happen to me
This frustration is all I see
And you've taking me
And you're breaking me down
And this will be different, I promise
I really promise

And this time things will be different
It grows and grows and grows

'Cause it's the way we talk
The way we walk
The way your words connect my thoughts
The way we move
The way we stand
The way our world is in your hands
My life's just like a prison
We shout but no one listens
We're set
All in position
Use us
Take us
Break us!
It's coming to that point
I'm down on my knees
I'm praying
You change my life
And change me
I'll follow you there
I've got nothing to lose
Unwind me
Heal my sickness
Unravel this
And set me free

The way we talk
The way we walk
The way your words connect my thoughts
The way we move
The way we stand
The way our world is in your hands
My life's just like a prison
We shout but no one listens
We're set
All in position
Use us
Take us
Break us!1Embed
