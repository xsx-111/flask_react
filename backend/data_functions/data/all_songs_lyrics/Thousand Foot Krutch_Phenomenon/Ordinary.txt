Ordinary Lyrics
Digging slowly
Flowers growing
Beautiful from inside me
Overlooking misrepresentation of my findings
Are we gonna come back to this?
How we ever gonna make a match to this?
Let's lay low like a mattress
They'll just be another one after this

You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside of me
And you could never fill these shoes
'Cause I refuse to lose
I'm just ordinary me

Digging slowly
Flowers growing
Beautiful from inside me
Overlooking misrepresentation of my findings
Are we gonna come back to this?
How we ever gonna make a match to this?
Let's lay low like a mattress
They'll just be another one after this
You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside of me
And you could never fill these shoes
'Cause I refuse to lose
I'm just ordinary me
You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside of me
I'm prepared to let this go
To let everybody know
I'm just ordinary

Growin' up as an adolescent
So full of those questions
Got me second guessin' my mind with the message
And the mention of my progression
Class is in session
How long will we all keep guessin?
When you've never been
It's so evident from your grumbling, Man
I wonder when we'll talk
If you wanna talk
Take the mask off
We can rock
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
One
You can't make me feel this way
Two
You won't make me run away
You can't understand my chemistry
Laugh if that makes me ordinary

You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside of me
And yxou could never fill these shoes
'Cause I refuse to lose
I'm just ordinary me
You could never stop this feelin' I've got inside of me
I'm prepared to let this go
To let everybody know
I'm just ordinary

One
You can't make me feel this way
Two
You won't make me run away
Can't understand my chemistry
Laugh if that makes me ordinary
One
You can't make me feel this way
Two
You won't make me run away
Can't understand my chemistry
Laugh if that makes me ordinaryEmbed
