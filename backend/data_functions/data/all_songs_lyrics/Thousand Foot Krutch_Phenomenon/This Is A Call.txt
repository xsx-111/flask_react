This Is A Call Lyrics
She fooled all of her friends into thinking she's so strong
But she still sleeps with her light on
And she acts like it's alright on, as she smiles again
And her mother lies there sick with cancer
And her friends don't understand her
She's a question without answers
Who feels like falling apart
She knows, she's so much more than worthless
She needs to find her purpose, she wonders what she
Did to deserve this and

She's calling out to you this is a call this is a call out
Cause every time I fall down
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now
And my hazard signs are all out
I'm asking you to show me what this life is all about

And he tells everyone a story
'Cause he thinks his life is boring
And he fights so you won't ignore him
'Cause that's his biggest fear
And he cries but you'll rarely see him do it
And he loves but he's scared to use it
So he hides behind the music, 'cause he likes it that way
And he knows, he's so much more than worthless
He needs to find the surface
'Cause he's starting to get nervous and
He's calling out to you this is a call this is a call out
'Cause every time I fall down
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now
And my hazard signs are all out
I'm asking you to show me what this life is all about

Have you ever felt this way before
Cause I don't wanna hide here anymore
Take me to a place where nothing's wrong and
Thanks for coming shut the door
And they say someone out there sees us
Well if you're real then save me Jesus
'Cause I've been this way for far too long
I wasn't meant to feel alone

And now I'm calling out to you this is a call this is a call out
Cause every time I fall down
I reach out to you
And I'm losing all control now
And my hazard signs are all out
I'm asking you to show me what this life is all about
Show me what this life is all about
Show me what this life is all about1Embed
