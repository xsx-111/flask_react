Step To Me Lyrics
I've been as far you can go
I've learned a lot and now I know
You're never gonna get me on the floor again
I'm prepared to take you to the end
Never gonna play your games again
Bring your whole team and all your friends
But I hope your listenin'

Haunt me
If you want me
But I'll warn you
If you ever step to me

I sometimes wish that I could fly
Hold me tight in your arms tonight
Sick of livin' inside a lie
Alright
I can't count the times I've tried
Stand alone just to lift you high
You're my answer to the question why
Why

I'm sick of letting you control
(Me and all) the places that I go
I'm never giving in to you again
Take, take another look at me
(Take another look)
And tell me what you see
All of these kats tryin' to get under my skin
But they can't step over me
You try to control me
But you can't hold me
You don't own me
If you ever step to me

('Cause)
I sometimes wish that I could fly
Hold me tight in your arms tonight
Sick of livin' inside a lie
Alright
I can't count the times I've tried
Stand alone just to lift you high
You're my answer to the question why
Why

I know it's not me
Take a look inside me
I'm sick of these ways
So sick of these games
Couldn't see it 'til I multiplied you
Call me a freak
But I don't hear the words you speak
I'm takin' control
Just lettin' you know
That I won't get sucked in by you
('Cause)
I sometimes wish that I could fly
Hold me tight in your arms tonight
I'm sick of livin' inside a lie
Alright
I can't count the times I've tried
Stand alone just to lift you high
You're my answer to the question why
Why

Haunt me
If you want me
But I'll warn you
If you ever step to me again
You try to control me
But you can't hold me
You don't own me
If you ever step to meEmbed
