I Climb Lyrics
From in the middle of the room she hears the conversation moving
Further from where she's going without even knowing
Now the vibrations in the floor are getting closer to the door
And is this the way you let your problems drift away to?

I climb so high
It blows me away sometimes
See through my holes
Into this place I call my own
And this time I'll try
It's in the air tonight
Sleep tonight
No more cryin'
Cause I've got you on my side

I don't want you to be anything at all
I just want you to say you love me
I don't care
Just stop living like this
I don't want to be anything at all
I just want you to see who I am
And stop the violence
No more silence
From in the middle of the room she hears the conversation moving
Further from where she's going without even knowing, knowing
Now the vibrations in the floor are getting closer to the door
And is this the way you let your problems drift away to?

I climb so high
It blows me away sometimes
See through my holes
Into this place I call my own
This time I'll try
It's in the air tonight
Sleep tonight
No more cryin'
Cause I've got you on my side

I don't want you to be anything at all
I just want you to say you love me
I don't care
Just stop living like this
I don't want to be anything at all
I just want you to see who I am
And stop the violence
No more silence
I'm gonna show ya I'm alive
Breathing clearly for the first time
Hold me in your arms
Take me to the place where you are
I needed time to clear my mind
Keeping balanced on this line
Was impossible before I met you

I climb so high
It blows me away sometimes
Sleep tonight
No more cryin'
'Cause I've got you on my side

I don't want you to be anything at all
I just want you to say you love me
I don't care
Just stop living like this
I don't want to be anything at all
I just want you to see who I am
And stop the violence
No more silence
I'll shout from the top of the rooftop singing
I'm not afraid of the bed I lay in
Listen to the sound of the voices ringing
I can't deny it
No more silence
Shout from the top of the rooftop singing
We're not afraid of the bed we lay in
Listen to the sound of the voices ringing
I can't deny it
No more silence4Embed
