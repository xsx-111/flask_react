Bounce Lyrics
We come rushing through your stereo system
Into your ear canal
Like the alignment of the solar system
Have you forgotten about the days when we just wanted to rock 'cause we like it that way and
No more hate
No more lies
No more politics
So sick of fakes who cry over copied rifts
This is the day that we rise and we conquer it
Raise your mics to the sky like apocalypse

Everyone bounce
Show me what it's all about
Don't stand just bounce
'Cause we're takin' over now
It's T.F.K
We rock the party
And keep the party jumpin' in an old school way

Situation restless
Like someone tryin' to sneak up on the guest list
Play for a team that's called "not to mess with"
And check out the scenario
Let the sound you hear
Control your stereo
Turn it up and let the people know
I'm never lettin' go
I'm never lettin' go
This is the day that we rise and we conquer it
Raise our mics to the sky like apocalypse
Everyone bounce
Show me what it's all about
Don't stand just bounce
'Cause we're takin' over now
It's T.F.K
We rock the party
And keep the party jumpin' in an old school way
Bounce
Show me what it's all about
Don't talk just bounce
Get up and let it all hang out
If you find it hard to breathe
Ya better just leave
We 'bout to make it hotter than the third degree

Let's break this mold
Can't let this hold us
Let's be soldiers
No longer let them control us
Boys and girls
Together we'll shake the world
If you believe then put it to the sky with me
If you agree there's more to this than what we see
And what we know
Then bounce 'til ya lose control
And grab a partner
We about to make this hotter
Turn up the heat while we get this started
The time has come now
Shake up the dust until it settles in the sand
Oh
Bounce! (Get up' N)
Bounce! (Wake up ' N)
Bounce! (Stand up 'N)
Let your spirit fly

Bounce
Show me what it's all about
Don't stand just bounce
'Cause w'ere takin' over now
It's T.F.K
We rock the party
And keep the party jumpin' in an old school way
Bounce
Show me what it's all about
Don't talk just bounce
Get up and let it all hang out
If you find it hard to breathe
Ya better just leave
We 'bout to make it hotter than the third degreeEmbed
