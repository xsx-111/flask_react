Faith Love And Happiness Lyrics
Everyone is up in my face
Need to get outta this place
It's hard to see with you in front of my face
Just another perfect day
Acting like they wanna talk to me
So fake
Yet so friendly
My eyes can see even the back of me
Won't you just let me be

Cause everyone is falling away
Feel like they're stolen from me
Wish everything didn't happen to me
All I want is faith, love & happiness
Every time one runs away another one's returning
I wish everyone could just see your face
Faith, love & happiness

It seems everyone is up in my space
Like it's the American way
I run in case somebody takes my place
Just another change of pace
I know you think you know a lot about me
But so many wanna doubt me
My eyes can see even the back of me
Won't you just let me be
Cause everyone is falling away
Feel like they're stolen from me
Wish everything didn't happen to me
All I want is faith, love & happiness
Every time one runs away another one's returning
I wish everyone could just see your face
Faith, love & happiness

Every which way I turn I've got the option of a million choices
Every single word I say is judged by a million critics
Every which way you turn you got the sound of a million voices
Every single move you make is torn by a million cynics
When will we all see the light of day?
I don't know

Cause everyone is falling away
Feel like they're stolen from me
Wish everything didn't happen to me
All I want is faith, love & happiness
Every time one runs away another one's returning
I wish everyone could just see your face
Faith, love & happinessEmbed
