Firecracker Lyrics
Black birds slow and softly breaks a glass of wine
Broken bluesy whisper sing to me tonight

Well, everybody wants to go forever
I just wanna burn up hard and bright
I just wanna be your firecracker
And maybe be your baby tonight
Maybe be your baby tonight

Lady your kicks of silence off into your room
Kiss me slow and softly make me dream of you

Well, everybody wants to go forever
I just wanna burn up hard and bright
I just wanna be your firecracker
And maybe be your baby tonight
Maybe be your baby tonight

So when does the plane go down?
'Cause I'm gonna ride it till it hits the ground
Then go out with a fight
'Cause I just wanna be your baby tonightEmbed
