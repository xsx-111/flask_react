Wild Flowers Lyrics
Poor girl, no Ma
Nothing much to speak of but a rough diamond
Sleep now and your angels will come, dear
Poor Matilda
Handcuffed hard to the wheel
And steering wildly
Through loves fields, so blindly

Forever only takes its toll on some, oh oh
But, tonight you're sleeping alone
Without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone
Without him

And everything went up in smoke
Like wildflowers
Wildflowers, dear

Poor girl, lonely
Shuffles through the parade
Of a sleepless circus promenade
Hold on, dear
Poor girl, no Ma
Sister steals her a coat
For the windless breezes
Sleep now and Jesus will come, dear
Forever only takes its toll on some, oh oh
But, tonight you're sleeping alone
Without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone
Without him

And everything went up in smoke
Like wildflowers
Wildflowers
Wildflowers
Wildflowers, ohEmbed
