Gonna Make You Love Me Lyrics
Riot on the streets, the touch beneath the sheets
It's only gonna make you love me more
The cops they got the guns, the night destroys the sun
It's only gonna make you love me more

This here world, well, it was mine to take
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
And I'll come to you like a little girl
It's only gonna make you love me more

Moonlight on the beach, sweet amphetamines
It's only gonna make you love me more
Bottles and the cans, the idiots go dance
It's only gonna make you love me more

This here world, well, it was mine to take
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
And I'll come to you like a little girl
It's only gonna make you love me more

They say that love is hell
But I've only been laughin' ever since I fell
It's only gonna make you love me more
The Lord will have His way but I'm just a call away
It's only gonna make you love me more
This old world, well, it was mine to take
Faith can keep you warm, but I'll teach you how to shake
And I'll come to you like a little girl
It's only gonna make you love me moreEmbed
