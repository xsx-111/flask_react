Somehow, Someday Lyrics
I want to tell you something
That I should've, long ago
I wish that you and I had those kids
Maybe bought us that home
I wish that we were stumbling fast
Down on Irving and 14th Street
I wish that we were still in your room
In your bed and you were holding me

'Cause there ain't no way I'll ever stop from loving you now
There ain't no way I'll ever stop from loving you now
No, there ain't no way
And I'm gonna try and show you somehow
Somehow and I know someday
Someday
Someday

I dreamt that you and I were still young
Laughing like little kids
I'll never know just how bad it hurt
Or what I did
I wish that we were stumbling fast
Down on Irving and 6
I wish we were still making plans
But now there's nothing to fix
But there ain't no way I'll ever stop from loving you now
There ain't no way I'll ever stop from loving you now
No there ain't no way and I'm gonna try and show you somehow
Somehow, and I know someday
Someday
Someday
Someday
Oh honey, someday
Someday, ohEmbed
