Nobody Girl Lyrics
Well, the night makes moves
And she shatters like broken glass
Better play it cool
Better let it pass
Have you been screening your smokes?
And whispers in an all night bar
Better off as the fool
Than the owner of that kind of heart

They don't know you anyway
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away

Just a nobody girl
With a radar to the scene
When the emptiness finds you
You find all the numbers you need
Say you follow your heart
Well, honey you're just being lost
You can follow your gut
But how much would it cost?

They don't know you anyway
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away
You're nobody girl
You're nobody girl
You're a nobody, girl
You're nobody girl
You're nobody girl
You're a nobody, girl

The night plays games
And the people they come and go
Well, they trade in their pieces
For a late-night ride on your rodeo
If your horses could talk, I wonder if they would complain
I know they're rested and ready
They've been going nowhere for days

They don't know you anyway
They don't know you, they don't even mind the wait

'Cause you're nobody girl
You're a nobody girl
You're a nobody, girl
You're a nobody girl
Nobody girl
Nobody, girl
You're a nobody girl
Nobody girl
You're a nobody girl
You're a nobody girl
Nobody girl
You're a nobody girlEmbed
