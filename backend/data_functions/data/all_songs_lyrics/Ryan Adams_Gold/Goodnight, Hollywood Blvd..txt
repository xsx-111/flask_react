Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd. Lyrics
It's happening baby
They're putting up the chairs
Taking the money
And all we can do is pray
Pray for tomorrow

So close your eyes
And close your mouth
And do this all in time to the music
That screams like a child
In the back of your mind
In a clown's saloon

So goodnight Hollywood Boulevard, goodnight
See ya soon
Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard, goodnight
See you sometime
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

Run away baby
Back to your lonely house
You wanted the honey
But you were only just stinging yourself
It's hard to watch
So I close my eyes
And I close my mouth
And I do this all in time to the music
That dances like fools set on fire
Flailing their arms
In a room full of whores

So goodnight Hollywood Boulevard, goodnight
See ya soon
Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard, goodnight
See you sometime, see you sometime
Yeah, right
Yeah, right
Yeah, right
Yeah, right
Yeah, rightEmbed
