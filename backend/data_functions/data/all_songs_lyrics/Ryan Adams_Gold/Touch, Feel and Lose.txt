Touch, Feel and Lose Lyrics
Knew I was never gonna talk to you tomorrow
Oh, the birds how they sing
If you were a bird could you sing me a song of sorrow?
'Cause all I know now from you is grief

But I never wanted to be your rollin' train
I never wanted to be your dancin' shoes
I just wanted you to love me
I just wanted you to love me
Touch, feel and lose

Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

Thought maybe I could be some kind of shelter
Oh, your storm, how it raged
You know your kisses, they're like lightnin' and thunder
And smile is sweet and come down like rain

But I never wanted to be your rollin' train
I never wanted to be your dancin' shoes
I just wanted you to love me
I just wanted you to love me
Touch, feel and lose, honey, oh, oh
And cry, cry, cry
And cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

I just wanted you to love me
I just wanted you to love me
Touch, feel and lose, honey

Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cryEmbed
