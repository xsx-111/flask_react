Enemy Fire Lyrics
Enemy fire
Enemy blanks
Enemy roses
Red coloured tanks

It's too late baby
Baby, it's too late
Learn how to change and maybe I could stay

Enemy fire
Enemy planes
Enemy roses
And red coloured chains

It's too late baby
Baby, it's too late
Learn how to change and maybe I could stayEmbed
