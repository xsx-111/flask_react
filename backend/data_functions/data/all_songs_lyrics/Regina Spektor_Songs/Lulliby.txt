Lulliby Lyrics
I know that you cannot be
Here
I know that you are not mine
Now
Looking out the window
At another window
I see toenails changing colors
Like the leaves of Fall

If you often smile
But often don't
Smile
Which do you do more often
Smile, or not?
I dreamt a hydrant
Was covered in snow
A white light glowing below
