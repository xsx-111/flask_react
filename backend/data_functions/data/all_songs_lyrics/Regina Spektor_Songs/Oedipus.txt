Oedipus Lyrics
I'm the king's thirty second son
Born to him a thirty second time
Born to him with my hair still on
Born to him with two eyebrows on
And that's all I was wearing
When I woke up staring at the world

My mom had been a rather crazy queen
But not at all a sex machine
She liked to keep her body clean, clean
Thought the world to be quite obscene
But she'd retire to her chambers
And we remain quite strangers

And to see me made her awful sad
And to touch me made her awful sad
And to see me made her awful
And to touch me made her awful

I'm the king's thirty second son
And all it took was thirty second's time
But a spoiled little prince I was not
Had a chamber maid and a chamber pot
And there's thirty one others just like me
There's thirty one others I can be
Sometimes I'd stand by the royal walls
The sky'd be so big that it broke my soul
And I stood on my toes to catch a glimpse
Of my mother's eyes and my mother's skin
But she'd retire to her chambers
And we remain quite strangers

And to see me made her awful sad
And to touch me made her awful sad
And to see me made her awful
And to touch me made her awful

And then one morning I woke up
And I thought 'Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus'
Then one morning, and I woke up
And I thought 'Rex, Rex, Rex'
Then one morning I woke up
And I thought 'Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus'

'Cause thirty two is still a goddamn number
Thirty two still counts
Gonna make it count, gonna make it count
Gonna oh, oh
Thirty two is still a goddamn number
Thirty two still counts
Gonna make it count, gonna make it count
Gonna oh, oh, oh
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the

I'm the king's thirty second son
There's thirty one others just like me
There's thirty one others on the way
There's thirty one others after that

Sometimes I stand by the royal gate
People screaming love and hate
And they scream, and they scream
And they scream, and they scream
Long live the king, long live the queen

And to see me made her awful sad
And to touch me made her awful sad
And to see me made her awful
And to touch me made her awful
And then one morning I woke up
And I thought 'Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus'
Then one morning, and I woke up
And I thought 'Rex, Rex, Rex'
Then one morning I woke up
And I thought 'Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus'

'Cause thirty two is still a goddamn number
Thirty two still counts
Gonna make it count, gonna make it count
Gonna oh, oh, oh
Thirty two is still a goddamn number
Thirty two is still a goddamn number
Thirty two is still a goddamn number
Thirty two is still a goddamn number
Thirty two, thirty two
Thirty two, thirty two
Thirty two, thirty two
Thirty two, thirty two

Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king
Long live the king4Embed
