Reading Time with Pickle Lyrics
Walking home from work
Stop at the supermarket
The condiment aisle
A jar of pickles catches the eye
Made eye contact with a solitary pickle
Bought the jar, took it home
Then made up the stairs
And made it through the doorway
And waded through the floor
Tried to head in the general direction
Of the bathroom door
The truest room in the whole damn house

Saying love is the answer
To a question that I have forgotten
And I know I've been asked
So the answer's got to be love, yeah

So feeding time with TV
Then sleeping time, not sleepy
So reading time with pickle
But where the bedside lamp had been
Is now emanating soft, soft green
Has it always been this way?
Is it possible that all this magic went unnoticed?
Maybe now things will start to change
And life will turn a better page
No more rage
Saying love is the answer
To a question that I have forgotten
But I know I've been asked
And the answer's got to be love, oh

Tomorrow, back to work again
But run to the supermarket
Running hopeful through the aisles
Haven't been this happy in a long time
But not a single jar was smiling
After all
Man, pickle jars are just pickle jars
And pickles are just pickles
Ingredients: water, salt, cucumbers, garlic, and pickling spices

But love is the answer
To a question that I have forgotten
And I know I've been asked
And the answer's got to be love...
Love is the answer
To a question that I have forgotten
And I know I've been asked...
And the answer's got to be love...
And the answer's got to be love...
And the answer's got to be love...
And the answer's got to be love, yeahEmbed
