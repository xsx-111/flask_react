Lounge Lyrics
I don't care that flowers grow for you
And me, and me
You don't know what love is till you see
Her standing there
A web of skin and nails and hair
And bones and bones
And thorns
Rushing in, out her hair
You think you are alive, but you are dead
You keep, on driving in your car asleep
I'm driving in your car
I dont know why flowers grow in winter time
The sky turns gray the sun don't shine
And people rush to be on time
For warmth they wrap them selves in woolen cloaks
And hats and scarves
Like larva in their incubators
And drive and drive

And drive and drive and drive
Until they get awayEmbed
