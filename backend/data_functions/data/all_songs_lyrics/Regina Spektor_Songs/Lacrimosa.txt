Lacrimosa Lyrics
We keep on burying our dead
We keep on planting their bones in the ground
But they won't grow
The sun doesn't help
The rain doesn't help

If my garden would have a fence
Then the rabbits couldn't just come in
And sit on the grass
And eat all the flowers
And shit

Hi, I'm Icarus, I'm falling
Down, man for judgment must prepare me
Spare, oh god, in mercy spare me

Man, I have a terrible feeling
That something's gone awful, very wrong with the world
Is it something we made?
Is it something we ate?
Is it something we drank?
Hi, I'm Icarus, I'm falling
From the dust of earth
Returning back, for judgement must prepare me
Spare, oh god spare me
Lacrimosa

We keep on burying our dead
We keep on planting their bones in the ground
But they won't grow
The sun doesn't help
And all we've got
Is a giant crop
Of names and dates

Hi, I'm Icarus I'm falling down
Ah! this day of tears and mourning
From the dust of earth returning
Man for judgement must prepare me
Spare, oh god, spare me
Lacrimosa
Lacrimosa dies illa
Qua resurget ex favilla
Judicandus homo reus
Huic ergo parce, Deus1Embed
