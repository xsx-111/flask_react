Aching to Pupate Lyrics
Aching to pupate
Aching to pup-p-p-pate 
Pu-pupate, pu pate
Pu-pate, pu-pupate, pu pa-ate

I should peddle butterflies
There's a shortage in the city
I'll stand on a street corner
All mysterious and giddy
When the passers-by pass by
I will open up my trenchcoat
They will see the butterflies
Dangling like fake rolexes
Every morning I wake up
With a purpose and a smirk
I'll put on my fake moustache
I'll drink Heineken eat cornflakes
Then I'll call my mom and dad
Tell them that I'm doing fine
Or I'll write a tipsy letter
To a real good friend of mine
Or I'll jump up on the bed
Waltzing madly with the broomstick
But before I leave the house
I will fill my lips with lipstick
But peddling is a dirty sport
There's competition in the city
Everyone is on a street corner
All mysterious and giddy
Some are selling bags and shoes
Some are selling books and gold
I've been standing here for days
Not one butterfly's been sold
And how I'm...
Aching to pupate
Aching to pup-p-p-pate 
Pu-pupate, pu pate
Pu-pate, pu-pupate, pu pa-ateEmbed
