Daniel Cowman LyricsOn the day that Daniel Cowman stopped existing
The world should've ended right then and there
Precisely at four-fifteen when he stopped existing
The world should've ended
How could it go on
How could it go on
How could it go on
When I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
So now that we got that straight
Doesn't mean that I can fly
Doesn't mean that I can go do whatever I want
Now that we got that clear
And you know that I'm not here
Doesn't mean that I can go do whatever I please
The premature ejaculation of his death sentence
Hit Daniel in the face like a big round spitball
And everything got hazy in the courtroom
And then he stood up and then he sat back down
Another two times in a row
And everything got real slow like a gunshot in the movies
And he remembered heroin boy walking through the door
Bouncing off the walls and the floor
Taking off his belt
Taking off his pants
Filling up the bathtub
Getting ready to go in for a swim
Singing
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
I don't exist
So now that we got that straight
Doesn't mean that I can fly
Doesn't mean that I can go do whatever I want
Now that we got that clear
And you know that I'm not here
Doesn't mean that I can go do whatever I please
And he start remembering
And remembering
And remembering
And remembering
And remembering
The heroin boy'd walk through the door
And he was screaming and everybody was like
"What're you screaming as if it's the end of the world?"
And he was like, "Well, it is"
And I was sitting in the corner with my pants down
And I was sure someone next door was blowing up balloons
And they was red and orange
And there was this one lady at the bar and she was trying to buy gin
And this other lady at the bar and she was trying to sell gin
And it worked out good for the boths of them
And heroin boy started taking off his belt
Started taking off his pants
Started taking off his shoes
Filling up the bathtub
Getting ready to go in for a swim
I says, "No
You're gonna drown"
And he says, "No
I can't drown
Simply because
A man destined to hang can never drown
A man destined to hang can never drown
A man destined to hang can never ever drown
A man destined to drown can never burn
A man destined to drown can never burn
A man destined to drown can never ever burn
A man destined to fry can never, ever, ever
A man destined to fry can never, ever, ever
A man destined to fry can never, ever, ever die
In any other way than frying
I'm lucky that I'm dying by hanging and not drowning
So now that we got that straight
Can't I just be left alone?
I want to take a fucking bath"3Embed
