Who Knows What Tomorrow May Bring LyricsWe are not like all the rest
You can see us any day of the week
Come around, sit down, take a sniff, fall asleep
Baby, you don't have to speak
I'd like to show you where it is
But then it wouldn't even mean a thing
Nothing is easy, baby, just please me
Who knows what tomorrow may bring?
If for just one moment
You could step outside your mind
And float across the ceiling
I don't think the folks would mindEmbed
