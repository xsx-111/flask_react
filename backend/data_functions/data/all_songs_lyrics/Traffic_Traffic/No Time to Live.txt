No Time to Live LyricsAs time begins to burn itself upon me
And the days are growing very short
People try their hardest to reject me
But in a way, their conscience won't be caught
Something's happening to me day by day
My pebble on the beach is getting washed away
I've given everything that was mine to give
And now I'll turn around and find that there's no time to live
So often I have seen that big wheel of fortune
Spinning for the man who holds the ace
There's many who would change their places for him
But none of them have ever seen his lonely faceEmbed
