You Can All Join In LyricsHere's a little song you can all join in with
It's very simple and I hope it's new
Make your own words up if you want to
Any old words that you think will do, yeah
Yellow, blue, what'll I do? Maybe I'll just sit here thinking
Black, white, stop the fight, does one of these colours ever bother you?
Here's a little dance you can all join in with
It's very simple and I hope it's new
Make your own steps up if you want to
Any old steps that you think will do
Left, right, don't get uptight, keep in line and you'll be alright
Clap hands, move around, make sure no one puts you down
Here's a little world you can all join in with
It's very simple and I hope it's new
Make your own life up if you want to
Any old life that you think will do
Love, yeah, it's nothing new, there's someone much worse off than you are
Help me set them free, just be what you want to beEmbed
