Murder Mystery Lyrics
Pour the hourglass sand in the rusted tin can
The looking glass man dressed in robes from Japan
The chauffeur of the van with the globe in his hand
The roller coaster lands in the ocean
Alas, the commotion is matched by the force of the splash
The source of the blast was a porcelain gat
The orphan in rags
A fraudulent match for the torturous wrath of the horseman in black
The sorcerer laughs
Foes in the bath with a cauldron of rats, gone in a flash
The forces of life
Absorbed in a fight with the wrong and the right
The author was typing, the water was icy, the slaughter was pricey
The martyr was light-skinned with chartered indictments that started in high school
His father was Michael, He shot him with a rifle
A product of the cycleEmbed
