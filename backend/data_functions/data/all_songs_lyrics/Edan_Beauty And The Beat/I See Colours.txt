I See Colours Lyrics
Prince Paul already used this loop
But I'mma keep it moving and put you up on the scoop now
I first saw the Earth (in 78)
Around the same time that rap music saw its first plate
Nowadays my aim's to be a kingpin with words
Kids will jock my personality like King Tim the third
Word to the fatback queen with the sugar hills
A Jimmy Spicer verse without the payment of a dollar bill
I gots to chill though, on thinking about sex
Cause it's risky for my third leg or should I say the second neck
Connect the dots with all the faggots making records
Who couldn't suck a dick or put the gloss on they upper lip
They can't fuck with this, I'm just too vivid
Like rainbows falling out the sky that turn liquid
My word systems turn your scene to tangerine
The kid sees colours flashing wild on his movie screen

Red and yellow and pink and green
Purple and orange and blue
I can sing a rainbow
I can sing a rainbow

I love most brothers but someone told me that I burn bridges
I simply use a rapper bones to build my furniture
I work with the aesthetic of a brain medic
Cutting up the reels with crystal shards to make a tape edit
I take lettuce, onions, tomato
Add a dab of mayo plus the fish fillet-o
Appetizing gray matter with a strange platter
The symmetry of energy with chemistry and plasma
After you latch on to lost masters
Come back to re-evaluate the now chapter
Style masters born to make classics
And paint canvas geometric break dancers
The Almighty made Saturn, caves and caverns
The flames of magma, rivers in Niagara
All of this beauty can be yours to discover
Can't you see it brother?
Without the LSD I see colors
Red and yellow and pink and green
Purple and orange and blue
I can sing a rainbow
I can sing a rainbow1Embed
