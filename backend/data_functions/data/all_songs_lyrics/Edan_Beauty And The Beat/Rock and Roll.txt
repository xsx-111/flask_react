Rock and Roll Lyrics
I be the headbanger with the double-edged razor
The breath-taker, dragon slayer-slash-savior
Assassinator, flamethrower fascinator
My Dagha/dagger blade cascade and catch the mayor
Captivator, spectator activator
Palladium's packed, they pay me in stacks of paper
Aggravated assault, halt the path of strangers
The strangler, long-ranger devil devastator
Educated rebel with the heavy metal flava
Levels is elevated to decibels of danger
Volts from the generator blow the detonator
Decimate the place and left the radius a crater
I cater to the greater entertainer
And blaze the remainder with the energy of anger
Celebrate the maker, I'll mutilate later
And play a naysayer like an amplified bass player

The Riders on the Storm enter with Doors open
To bring raw dosage in the form of swarm locust
Beatles and Byrds, they seem evil and absurd
Gather with The Eagles who swerve to form herds
Butterflies made of Iron ride the horizon
Giving Creedence to the Revival of Posiedon
Who feeds in the Clearwater, you fear slaughter
The Lovecraft author pens the horror for tomorrow
Zombies and walking dead stalk the Talking Heads
Insects with open legs halt with awful dread
All along the web, the thread remains red
With bloodshed that led to where the Little Feet fled
To lost places, thought lost for all ages
With Small Faces sittin in walls of tall mazes
That overlook The 13th Floor with long gazes
Connected to the earthly core through Elevators
Check, the Underground is made of Velvet
Where butter-soft brothers talk tough on wax but ain't sell shit
Every cracker that rap ain't the Elvis
My Aqualung Cult-ivates the Blue Oyster shellfish
I design my Pearls Before Swine
And form rhymes to take you to a world before time
Where living things coexisted with Crimson Kings
Who on the Moon's Dark Side painted pretty things
That illustrated lessons conceived by The Mothers of Invention
Who also built a Stairway to Heaven
It's a present only to be stolen by a thief
The Judas Priest who unleashed his devil magic
My mental fabric, too thick for Lenny Kravitz
Who imitates Jimi Hendrix in every facet
Semi-automatic rap heavy metal jackets
Kill with mathematics then build on Black Sabbath1Embed
