Promised Land LyricsOut the dungeon of the brain pain I came
With the sell-a-lot plot from the megawatt mainframe
With a suit made of electricity..
With a suit made of electricity
I ran through the Great Wall of China, convincingly
That was after the World Tour..
That was after the World Tour
When I travelled through gravel and battled matter at the Earth's core
I did the show on a fireball..
I did the show on a fireball, a pioneer
Ran into the jungle and jetted wearing a lion's ear
I fought fear with the Hammer of Thor lent me..
I fought fear with the Hammer of Thor lent me
And tangled with the Angel of Death for four centuries
Put a nameplate on a asteroid belt..
Put a nameplate on a asteroid belt
And I ran through the future with an android's help
That's when civilians were made of metal..
That's when civilians were made of metal
I received the Coronation cause I had the last flower petals
My power settled a clash between races..
My power settled a clash between races
And put good people on the magazine faces
Substituted television scandals with elephants and pandas
Tell 'em it's the elegant commando
With a hand so large..
With a hand so big, I punched a sphinx in the nose
In the nose, decomposed, and so the story goes
I smacked a 40o out of a young man's hand..
I smacked a 40 ounce, out of a young man's hand
And fed him lessons of life to formulate a plan
I wore the Prime Meridian as a wrist band..
I wore the Prime Meridian as a wrist band
And gave away my riches but I still remained a rich man
I thought of freedom and I jetted to the Promised Land..1Embed
