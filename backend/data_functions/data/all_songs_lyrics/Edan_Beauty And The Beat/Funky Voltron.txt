Funky Voltron Lyrics
We heard about the mess
Weak brothers on stage
But we have more finesse
So if we orchestrate well 
Then you should put us on and press charge the clientele
And if the live show is strong 
Shit, we form like Voltron (Let's get it on)
The triathlon, telepath, math
When he ain't speak
He speaks on my behalf
Mentally connected
Throw the microphone 50 feet in the air
And then catch it
Somebody throws a baby...
Oh shit!
Do a spin move and catch it
And the crowd goes crazy
Call me foolish
180? 
Maybe twice the sacrifice
My life knifed the lazies
SO all ladies... 
Best move with the groove let me do it for you, tuck your titties back in
This ain't a place of sin
I think it's more like sport
Let the games begin!
We got the raw-type talk
Absorb it like salt
Four by Four
That's the steps on the floor
'Eography' with the prefix core
What be the core but a solid foundation?
Skill
Preparation
These sorts of things do a fine rapper make...
Faces I bake
Take a look at those kicks 
Your physique is a dream indeed
It's like peaches and cream
We more mean like needles
And see, so they all bleed tryna compete with the team
We form V-O-L-T-R-O-N so  
This mic will let you know 
What's your name good man?
Insight, with the plan, who are you too?
E-to the-dan, and together we stand
'Cause when the beat sound iffy and the kids bark lies
It'll be a sad day like when the Biz Mark dies!
This art's mine to master
A Wizzard is a grand mixer
Speed it up a little faster
That's quicker
Pumping through your transistor
Ghetto-blastin
We the master builders
Spilling acid on rapper's bill is a massive thrill
But actually mass'll kill
With daffodils
We smash and kill
Captivate!
Max and chill
We catching mass-appeals!
So this competition lack the skill? 
So we shouldn't feel shame when we crack they grill!
But is the mission fulfilled?
NO! The people await the next show!
