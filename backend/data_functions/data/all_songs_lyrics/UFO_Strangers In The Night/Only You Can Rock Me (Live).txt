Only You Can Rock Me (Live) LyricsWhos taking time out, well take a shine out
Were the boys, we got nothing to lose
Ive had enough now of school and stuff now
You ain't with us, then its just bad news
Only you can rock me, rock me
Come on, back now, do it again
Only you can rock me, rock me
Kicking out just like a hurricane
We can't wait from day to day
'Cause weve got something to say
We can't wait from day to day
'Cause weve got something to say
Come on to street now, on every corner
Breaking out and were doing what we wanna
Just like a jewel shines in the night
She burns so hot out under the street light
Only you can rock me, rock me
Come on, back now, do it again
Only you can rock me, rock me
Kicking out just like a hurricane
We are here and theres no end
We keep on coming again
We are here and theres no end
We just keep coming again
Whos taking time out, well take a shine out
Were the boys, we got nothing to lose
Ive had enough now of school and stuff now
You ain't with us, then its just bad news
Only you can rock me, rock me
Come on, back now, do it again
Only you can rock me, rock me
Kicking out just like a hurricane
We can't wait from day to day
'Cause weve got something to say
We are here and theres no end
Well keep on coming again
We can't wait from day to day
'Cause weve got something to say
We are here and theres no end
Well keep on coming againEmbed
