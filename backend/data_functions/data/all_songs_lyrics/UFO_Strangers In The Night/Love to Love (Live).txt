Love to Love (Live) LyricsOh it's been too many times, and I can't go back
Night bars, guitars, rundown motels like shacks
What it mounts up to, I don't want it at all
Lost you, and I want you today
Misty green and blue
Love to, love to, love you
Misty green and blue
Love to, love to, love you
To be somethin', to be near you
Don't say that you'll never know
Love to, love to, love you
Half the time it could seem funny
The other half is just too sad
This west bound moon's only rise and fall
Lost you and I want you today
Misty green and blue
Love to, love to, love you
Misty green and blue
Love to, love to, love you
To be somethin', to be near you
I don't know where I'm goin' to
I've tried and I need you to stay
Yeah yeaEmbed
