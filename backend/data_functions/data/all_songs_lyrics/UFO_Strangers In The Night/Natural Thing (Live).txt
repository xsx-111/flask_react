Natural Thing (Live) LyricsSaid she came from Memphis
You can look but, please dont touch
Didn't like rock and rollers
It seemed a bit much too much
'Cause its the natural thing, you feel at the start
Natural blood starts to flow
Yeah, the natural thing, you get at the start
Then she'll never let you go
Hey girl, now does it feel alright
Think Im gettin' through
Dont you think the bands real tight
Wait till we start to move
May sound funny, but you gave it to me
I didn't even like it
May sound funny, but you gave it to me
And now I got to live without it
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
I been down to Atlanta
Got to move my feet
Gettin' down for the last encore
With every star she meets
'Cause its the natural thing, you feel at the start
Natural blood starts to flow
Yeah, the natural thing, you get at the start
Then she'll never let you go
Hey girl, now does it feel alright
Think Im gettin' through
Dont you think the bands real tight
Wait till we start to move
May sound funny, but you gave it to me
I didn't even like it
May sound funny, but you gave it to me
And now I got to live without it
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
May sound funny, but you gave it to me
I didn't even like it
May sound funny, but you gave it to me
And now I got to live without it
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it? yeah
Oh, God, why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?Embed
