Too Hot to Handle (Live) LyricsCaught in the crossfire, warnin' fight
Legends make or break game
Swept up by the rollin' waves of the night
They chase for fame
An' I was too, too hot baby
Too hot to handle
Yeah, I was too, too hot
Too hot to handle
Wink of an eye, the feelings ran high
A real rock an' roll molest
But I ain't no romance and I ain't no slow chance
Won't get no quick change
Yeah, I'm too, too hot baby
Too hot to handle
Yeah, I'm too, too hot baby
Too hot to handle
Sha la la la, roll you over
Turn you around and do it again
Sha la la la, keep on comin'
Do it once but never the same
Sha la la la, roll you over
Turn you around and do it again
Sha la la la, keep on comin'
An' do it once but never the same
I'm in your town, won't fool around
I'll take some action stand
Just like the story says, these boys are bad
So keep out of shootin' range
'Cause I'm too, too hot baby
Too hot to handle
Yeah I'm too, too hot
Too hot to handle
'Cause I'm too, too hot baby
Too hot to handle
Yeah, I'm too, too, too hot
Too hot to handleEmbed
