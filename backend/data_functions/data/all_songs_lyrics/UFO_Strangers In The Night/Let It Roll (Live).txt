Let It Roll (Live) LyricsCold run speed highway was the place where we'd all go
When our nerves were razor sharp, and we'd all let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Our machine's geared up, and we're really layin' it down, layin' it out
Let it go
When these wheels get rollin', let them roll right over you
'Cause I'm well greased down, and I'll always win it through
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Machine's geared up, and we're really layin' it down, layin' it out
Let it roll
Cold run speed highway was the place where we'd all go
When our nerves were razor sharp and we'd all let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Machine's geared up, and we're really layin' it down, layin' it out
Let it rollEmbed
