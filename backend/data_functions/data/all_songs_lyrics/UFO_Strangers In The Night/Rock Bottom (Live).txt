Rock Bottom (Live) LyricsSeventeen a nature's queen, you'll know what I mean
Twenty one, a long one you can see the numbers run
Now you look so peaceful, lyin' there asleep
With the wings of God above you, before the spirits meet
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
And shadow works is closin' in above lamps in your street
Lucifer goes walkin' down free to meet
Minutes pass so slowly by the hands on your clock
Heavens door don't open when you knock
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
With all darkness closin' in, will the light reveal your soul?
'Cause one sweet kiss on your clay cold lips
I'll know sleep you'll never know
Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go from here?
Where do we go?Embed
