Doctor Doctor (Live) LyricsDoctor doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor doctor, please
Oh, I just can't win
She walked up to me
And really stole my heart
And then she started
To take my body apart
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run
So far away from you
Doctor doctor, please
Oh, I'm goin' fast
Doctor doctor, please
You know I just can't last
It's only just a moment
She's turnin' paranoid
That's not a situation
For such a nervous boy
Doctor doctor, please
Oh, the mess I'm in
Doctor doctor, please
You know I just can't win
But you look so angry
As I crawled across your floor
She's got the strain
And I can't take any more
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run
So far away from you
Livin', lovin', I'm on the run
So far away from you
Doctor doctor, please
Doctor doctor, pleaseEmbed
