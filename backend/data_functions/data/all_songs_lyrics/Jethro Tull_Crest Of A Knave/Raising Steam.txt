Raising Steam LyricsOver high plains, through the snow...
Roll those tracks out, don't you know
I'm raising steam
Thin vein creeping; hot blood flow...
Spill a little where the new towns grow
I got my whole life hanging in a sack
Heading out into that wide world wide
You got your locomotive sitting on your track
And I don't care which way I ride
I may not be coming back
Left a lady with a heart
All in pieces come apart
Raising steam
That engine up front must
Have a heart big enough for the both of us
Riding shotgun on the sunset, stare it in the eye
Rocking on my heels out to the west
Funny how the whole world, historically
Feels the urge to chase the sun to rest
We may not be coming back
Let me be your engineer...
Have you smiling ear to ear
Raising steam
And will you tell me how it feels
When you're up and rolling on your driving wheels?
I got my whole life hanging in a sack
Heading out into that wide world wide
I'll be your locomotive blowing off its stack
And I don't care which way I ride
I may not be coming back
