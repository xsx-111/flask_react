Jump Start LyricsIn the dark of the city backwoods, something stirs then slips away
Law and order in darkest Knightsbridge. Crime and punishment at play
Hey, Mr. Policeman won't you come on over. Hook me up to the power lines of your love
Jump start, or tow me away
And through the bruised machinery, the smoking haze of industry
Another day with ball and chain. I do my time, then home again
Hey, Mrs. Maggie won't you come on over. Hook me up to the power lines of your love
Jump start, or tow me away
Well, should I blame the officers? Or maybe, I should blame the priest?
Or should I blame the poor foot soldier who's left to make the most from least?
Hey, Jack Ripper won't you come on over. Hook me up to the power lines of your love
Jump start, or tow me away
You can blame the newsman talking at you on the satellite T.V
And if you're fighting for your shipyards, you might as well just blame the sea
Hey, Mr. Weatherman come on over. Hook me up to the power lines of your love
Jump start, or tow me awayEmbed
