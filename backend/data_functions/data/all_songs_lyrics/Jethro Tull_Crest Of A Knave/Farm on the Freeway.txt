Farm on the Freeway LyricsNine miles of two-strand topped with barbed wire laid by the father for the son
Good shelter down there on the valley floor, down by where the sweet stream run
Now they might give me compensation...
That's not what I'm chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday
Now all I have got is a cheque and a pickup truck
I left my farm on the freeway
They're busy building airports on the south side...
Silicon chip factory on the east
And the big road's pushing through along the valley floor
Hot machine pouring six lanes at the very least
Now, they say they gave me compensation...
That's not what I'm chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday
Now all I have left is a broken-down pickup truck
Looks like my farm is a freeway
They forgot they told us what this old land was for
Grow two tons the acre, boy, between the stones
This was no Southfork, it was no Ponderosa
But it was the place that I called home
They say they gave me compensation...
That's not what I'm chasing. I was a rich man before yesterday
And what do I want with a million dollars and a pickup truck?
When I left my farm under the freeway1Embed
