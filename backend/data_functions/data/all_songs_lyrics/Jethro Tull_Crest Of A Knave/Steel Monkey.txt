Steel Monkey LyricsAs the moon slips up, the sun slips down
I'm a highrise jockey, and I'm heaven bound
Do the workboot shuffle, loose brains from brawn
I'm a monkey puzzle and the lid is on
Can you guess my name? Can you guess my trade?
I'm going to catch you anyway
You might be right. I'll give you guesses three
Feel me climbing up your knee
Guess what I am. I'm a steel monkey
Now some men hustle and some just think
And some go running before you blink
Some look up and some look down
From three hundred feet above the ground
Can you guess my name? And can you guess my trade?
Well, I won't rest before the world is made
Arm in arm the angels fly
Keep me from falling out the sky
Steel monkey
Steel monkey
Steel monkey
I work in the thunder and I work in the rain
I work at my drinking, and I feel no pain
I work on women, if they want me to
You can have me a climb all over you
Now, have you guessed my name?
And have you guessed my trade?
I'm cheap at the money I get paid
In the sulphur city, where men are men
We bolt those beams then climb again
