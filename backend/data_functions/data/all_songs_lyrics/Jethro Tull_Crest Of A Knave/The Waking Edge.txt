The Waking Edge LyricsAs I wake up in a room somewhere...
Dawn light not yet showing
There's just a thin horizon between me and her...
The edge of a half-dream glowing
Well, you know, I felt her in my dream last night
Strange how the sheets are warm beside me
Now, how do I catch the waking edge?
As it slips to the far and wide of me
Didn't I try to hold it down?
Freeze on the picture, hang sharp on the sound
Catch the waking edge
Another time
Familiar shadows in my hotel room
Are still here for the taking
They seem to linger on as the street lights fade
And the empty dawn is breaking
Private movie showing in my head...
Which button do I press for re-run?
And how do I catch the waking edge?
The edge of a dream about someone
Well, you know, I felt her in my dream last night...
Now the sheets are cold beside meEmbed
