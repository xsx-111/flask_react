Good Times Roll Lyrics
Let the good times roll
Let them knock you around
Let the good times roll
Let them make you a clown

Let them leave you up in the air
Let them brush your rock and roll hair
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, oh
Let the good times roll

Let the stories be told
Let them say what they want
Let the photos be old
Let them show what they want

Let them leave you up in the air
Let them brush your rock and roll hair
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll, oh
Won't you let the good times roll
Good times roll

If the illusion is real
Let them give you a ride
If they got thunder appeal
Let them be on your side

Let them leave you up in the air
Let them brush your rock and roll hair
Let the good times roll
Won't you let the good times roll, oh
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Won't you let the good times roll
Well, let the good times roll
Let 'em roll
Good times roll
Let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Ooh, let the good times roll
Let 'em roll (Good times roll)
Well, let the good times roll (Let the good times roll)
Let the good times roll (Good times roll)
(Let the good times roll)
Let the good times roll
Let 'em roll1Embed
