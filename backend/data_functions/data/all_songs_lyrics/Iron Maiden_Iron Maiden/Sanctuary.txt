Sanctuary Lyrics
Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before but I know how it feels

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight

I know you'd have gone insane If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law
Oh, I can laugh at the wind (ha ha ha!)
I can howl at the rain (Ow!)
Down in the canyon
Or out on the plains

I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law

So give me sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me sanctuary from the law
And love me tonight
Tonight
Love me tonight3Embed
