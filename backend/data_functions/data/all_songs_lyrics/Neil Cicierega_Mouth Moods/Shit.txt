If you want my future forget my past
If you wanna get with me better make it fast
Now don't go wasting my precious time
Get your act together we could be just fine
What do you think about that, now you know how I feel (Uh-huh! Uh-huh!)
Say you can handle my love, are you for real (Uh-huh! Uh-huh!)
I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try (Uh-huh! Uh-huh!)
If you really bug me, then I'll say goodbye (Goodbye!)

I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want
So tell me what you want, what you really really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna be a cowboy, baby
Ah

Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma zigazig ah
I'ma doo-doo  my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma tell you what I really really want
I'ma doo-doo my way, it's my way
My way or the highway
This shit is bananas! B-A-N-A-N-A-S
