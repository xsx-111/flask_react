Wow Wow LyricsSome--
People call me the space cowboy
(wicky wicky)
(wicky wicky) Cowboy
Wicky wicky wow, wicky wow, wicky wicky
Wild Wild Wild Wild Wild West
Desperado, Rough Rider
No, you don't want nada
Nada dis six gun in dis
Brother, runnin' this
Buffalo buffalo buffalo lololololololo
(wicky) Any damsel that's in distress
Be outta distress when she meet Jim Dress
Roughneck, so go check the roughneck, so go
Watch your step, we'll flex and get a hold of your dress
Swallow your buffalo, don't let your neck react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hand be at
When James Dress from the start of this, runnin' the game
Artemis, tamin' the west, so remember the James!
Now who you gonna call? wicky wicky BEES
Now who you gonna call? You don't wanna see my BEES
If you ever wanna see my bumrush, BREAKOUT, before you get BEES
At the WOW WOW
When I roll into the WOW WOW
When I stroll into the WOW WOW
When I bounce into the WOW WOW
Let's go, Sisqo
[We're goin' straight to
The Wild West
We're goin' straight to
The Wow Wow, Wow Wow]
Now, now, now
Now once upon a time in the wicky wicky
Madman lost his damn mind in the wicky wicky
Loveless, kidnap a dime, nothin' wicky wicky
Now I must put his behind to the bumrush.
Then through the shadows, in the saddles, ready for saddles
Bring all your bums in; here come the saddles
Behind my bum, all the yiffing you did?
Front and center, now where my hip be at?
Who dat is? Loveless, bad for your health
Lookin' damn good, though, if I can say it myself
Told me Loveless is a good man, I don't feel that
He got his behind looking damn good, though (wi-wicky)
Rough ride on a buffalo man
When y'all clowns gon' see that I can't love myself
Understand me son:
I'm the slickest they is
I'm the slickest they is
I'm the slicki-wicky-wickest they is
Now if you barkin' up the
Wrong tree we comin'
Don't be barkin' up the
Wrong tree, we gonna
Test your health, Loveless
Can't stand clowns? Then get out the WOW WOW
When I roll into the WOW WOW
When I stroll into the WOW WOW
When I bounce into the WOW WOW
[We're goin' straight to
The Wild West
We're goin' straight to
The Wow Wow, Wow Wow]


Any outlaw tryin' to draw with a pen and a pad
Can draw Jim West with a pen and a pad
Don't even think about a pen and a pad weighin' a ton
Just tryin' to draw just for fun
Sun up to sun down, rollin' around
See where the BEES oughta be found and rollin' around
The defenders of your health
Crushin' my hip and rollin' around
Don't mess with us, 'cause we in the WOW WOW
When I roll into the WOW WOW
When I stroll into the WOW WOW
When I bounce into the WOW WOW
[We're goin' straight to
The Wild West
We're goin' straight to
The Wow Wow, Wow Wow]
