Tiger Lyrics
Risin' up, back on the street
Did my time, took my chances
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his tiger 
So many tigers, it happens to tigers
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the tiger's dreams
You must fight just to keep them alive
It's the eye! Of the tiger
 
The eye! Of the tiger
 
Face to face, out in the heat
Hangin' tough, with the tiger (they're grrrrrrreat!)
They stack the odds 'till we take to the street
For the tiger with the skill to survive
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the tiger
Rising up to the challenge of our tiger (they're grrrrrrreat!)
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye!
Of the tiger!
 
The eye! Of the tiger
 
Tiger!
Risin' up, straight to the top
Got the guts, got the tiger
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man (they're grrrrrrreat!) Just a tiger-man
It's the eye of the tiger
It's the thrill of the fight
Rising up to the tiger of our tiger
And the-- tiger stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye!
Of the tiger! 
 (they're grrrrrrreat!)
 (they're grrrrrrreat!)
The eye of the tiger! (they're grrrrrrreat!)
The eye of the tiger-er-er!
The eye of the tiger!
The eye of the tiger!
They're grrrrrrr-!1Embed
