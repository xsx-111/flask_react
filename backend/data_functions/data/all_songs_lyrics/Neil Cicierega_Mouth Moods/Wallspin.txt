Wallspin Lyrics
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should have somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

Maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
You're my wonderwall, wonderwall
Maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
You're my wonderwall, wonderwall
(Short "Wa-" solo)

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I
Would like to say to you
But I don't know how
Maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
You're my wonderwall, wonderwall
Maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
You're my wonderwall, wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do, about you now

Maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
You're my wonderwall, wonderwall
Maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me
You're my wonderwall, wonderwall

And after all (wonderwall)
You're my wonderwall (wonderwall)
And after all (wonderwall)
You're my wonderwall (wonderwall)
And after all
