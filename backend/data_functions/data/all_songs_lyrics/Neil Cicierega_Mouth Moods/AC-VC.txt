AC/VC Lyrics

Back in black, I hit the sack
It's been too long, I'm glad to be back, yes, I'm-
I'm let loose, from the noose
That's kept me hangin' around, I'm just
Lookin' at the sky just to get me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusing every one of them and running wild

'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Ooh, I'm back, mama! Yes, I'm back!
Ooh, I'm...

Bah-hey-hey-hey! Bah-hey-hack, mama!
Back in black! Well, I'm back in black!
Bah-hey-hey-hey! Bah-hey-hey-hey!
Back, mama! Back, mama!

Back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack
I'm in a bang with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
Well, I'm back on the track, beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just making my play
Don't push your luck, get out of my way!

'Cause I'm back! Yes, I'm back!
Ooh, I'm back, mama! Yes, I'm back!
Ooh, I'm...

Bah-hey-hey-hey! Bah-hey-hack, mama!
Back in black! Well, I'm back in black!
Bah-hey-hey-hey! Bah-hey-hack, mama!
Back in black! Well, I'm back in black!
Yeah! Ooh, yeah! Ooooh, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
'Cause, I'm...

Bah-hey-hey-hey! Bah-hey-hey-hey!
Back, mama! Back, mama! 'Cause, I'm-
Bah-hey-hey-hey! Bah-hey-hey, mama!
Back in black! Well, I'm back in black! (Yeah!)
Bah-hey-hey-hey! (Bah-hey-hey-hey!)
Bah-hey-hack, mama! (Bah-hey-hack, mama!)
Bah-hey-hey-hey! (Bah-hey-hey-hey!)
Bah-hey-hack, mama! (Bah-hey-hack, mama!)
Back, mama! (Bah-hey-hey-hey!)
Back, mama! (Bah-hey-hack, mama!)
'Cause, I'm back in black! (Yeah!)
(Back in black!)

(Yeah! Yeah, yeah!)2Embed
