Busta LyricsA scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
He's also known as a busta
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass
So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and
No, I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at meEmbed
