Steal My Body Home Lyrics
Put me in a hole in the ground
With the money and the towel
And the women all running around
Can't complain about the mess
Momma killed the only dress
Now she's longing for the pines
Watch my troubles all unwind
Drinkin' gasoline and wine
Catch a chill off the stove
On the train they cannot feel
I lost my head beneath the wheel
Now she steals my body home

The trees are fake, the air is dead
The birds are stuffed with poison lead
And the ground is much too clean
And if it's only me who's scared
Strap 'em to the electric chairs
Ring the moon like a broken bell
When she drags you from the hill
Daddy's gonna burn down the still
We can watch it from the rooftop

Lay in to the frying pan
Now she kisses her own hand
With the fiddle on the fire
I took a leap into the fog
Sleeping on a hollow log
Now I'm coughing with no mouth
You can keep yourself inside
But you know you cannot lie
When the devil's your only friendEmbed
