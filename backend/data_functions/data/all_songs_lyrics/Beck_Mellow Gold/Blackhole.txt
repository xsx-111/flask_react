Blackhole Lyrics
When we, when we
Looking for a better home
Got me, got me
Burning out a light bulb
Cloudy, cloudy
Holding to a waste can
Yellow car, yellow car
Gather me inside there

Wake up, wake up
Nothing's gonna harm you
Glass wall, glass wall
Standing on the furniture
Little boy, little boy
Layin' in a sleeping bag
Watching, watching
Through the cracks in his eyelids

Stranger, stranger
Feeding on the broken snow
Lost head, lost head
Staring down the orange juice
Alphabet, alphabet
Can't afford a telephone
Blackhole, blackhole
Nothing's gonna harm you
