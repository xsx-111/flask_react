Truckdrivin Neighbors Downstairs (Yellow Sweat) Lyrics
"Come on, motherfucker. Put your clothes onâ€”come on"
"Fuckin' asshole!"
"You lousy puke!"
"Fuck you!"
"Why don't you call your mommy?"
"You're a fucking drunk."
"Yeah, I'm a fucking drunk..."
"Come on, motherfucker."
"...but you're a lousy lowlife who can't do nothing for himself."

Acid casualty with a repossessed car
Vietnam vet playing air guitar

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin'
Truck-drivin' neighbors downstairs
Yeah (yeah)

Whiskey-stained buck-toothed backwoods creep
Grizzly bear motherfucker never goes to sleep

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin'
Truck-drivin' neighbors downstairs
Ow, yeah (yeah)
Belly flopping naked in a pool of yellow sweat
Screaming "jackass" with a wet cigarette

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin'
Truck-drivin' neighbors downstairs
Ow (Oh, my goodness)
Oh...

Psychotic breakdown, double-edged axe
Growing' hair like a shag rug on my greasy back

It's just the shit-kickin', speed-takin'
Truck-drivin' neighbors downstairs
Oh my goodness (oh my goodness)

Oh, yeah
Come on, honey
Feel the grease
Grease, grease
Come on, honey
Feel the grease
Oh, my goodness
Come on, honey, feel the grease
Oh, yeah
Come on, lay it on me
Bring it down one more timeEmbed
