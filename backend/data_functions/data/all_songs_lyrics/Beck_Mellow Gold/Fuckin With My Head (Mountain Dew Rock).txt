Fuckin With My Head (Mountain Dew Rock) Lyrics
I ain't got no inclination
Give away my sweet sensation
Sleeping in an old tool shed
Scumbag crying on his pillow

When you wanna be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey
Fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey

Found myself in New Orleans
With a scarecrow in my jeans
Feed my forehead through the ceiling
Drank my coffee with a hubcap
Yeah

When you want to be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
No no no no
Fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey
Devil's got your pantyhose on his head
Oh yeah, and he's robbing me but all I got is cornbread
Well, you turn my body into a crutch
And now I'm limping all over when I feel your touch
Oh yeah

Put upon my jack-eyed boots
Running wild on the bayou
Now I'm talking on a walkie-talkie
Credit card glued to my hand
Feels good

When you wanna be with me then we will see
Who's fuckin' with my head
Hey hey hey hey
No no no no
Fuckin' with my head
Make me feel like an asshole

I ain't got no soul!
I ain't got no soul!
No no no no!
No no no no!
No no no no!
No no no no!3Embed
