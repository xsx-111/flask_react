Mutherfuker Lyrics
Yo homey don't play like that
You with your weak-ass shit

Hey mister asshole, what's your dirty hassle?
Sitting in your castle judging everyone
You're acting like it's chill when the deal's getting ill
Why don't you break your face on my head?

Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker

Total paranoia, trying to annoy you
Everything I do is to try and fuck you up
Screwdrivers drilling and I was such a spasm
Dropped yourself on the situation, dude

Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker
Everyone's out to get you, motherfucker1Embed
