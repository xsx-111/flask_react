Beercan Lyrics
Alcohol on my hands, I got plans
To ditch myself and get outside
Dancing women throwing plates
Decapitating their laughing dates
Swirling chickens caught in flight
Out of focus, much too bright
Coming down
Shiny teeth
Game show suckers trying to bleed
But I got a drug and I got the bug
And I got something better than love

How you like me now?
Pretty good
Going on, feeling strong

I quit my job blowing leaves
Telephone bills up my sleeves
Choking like a one man dust bowl
Freedom rock slime ball talking in code
Went down
Lit up the shack
Grab me a beer out of the sack
Everybody bent over twice
Painting the walls, throwing some dice
Leaping up into the air getting juiced up beyond belief
(And they were singing like this:)
Winos throwing Frisbees at the sun
Put my soul between a bun
Now I'm hungry, now I'm drunk
Now I'm running like a flaming pig
(Oh yeah)
Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Don't be kind, don't be rude
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose
(Oh yeah, my goodness)

Fluffy clouds
Jumping rainbows
Fluffy clouds
I'm sad
Jumping rainbows
A soft and snuggly place
Fluffy clouds
I'm sad
Jumping rainbows
A soft and snuggly place
Fluffy clouds
I'm sad and unhappy
Yppahnu dna das
Winos throwing Frisbees at the sun
Put my soul between a bun
Now I'm horny, now I'm drunk
Now I'm running like a flaming pig
(Oh yeah)
Scraping off the attitude
Old man eating all my food
Don't be kind, don't be rude
Just shake your boots and let it all get loose
(Oh yeah, my goodness)

Oh yeah, I like it like that
Oh, that is cold
Somebody put a flame-thrower on that
Oh my goodness!
Take me down to the depot
Buddy put me down on the bus
Oh yeah, I like it like that
Somebody bring me a plate of sassafras
Hey hey hey
Oh yeah
Uh huh!
What's happening?
What'd I mean?
Somebody called me up on the...2Embed
