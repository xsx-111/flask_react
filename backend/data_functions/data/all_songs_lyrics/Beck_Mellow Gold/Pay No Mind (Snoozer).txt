Pay No Mind (Snoozer) Lyrics
(This is song two on the album
This is the album right here
Put on the album)

Tonight the city is full of morgues
And all the toilets are overflowing
There's shopping malls coming out of the walls
As we walk out among the manure

That's why
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind

Give the finger to the rock n roll singer
As he's dancing upon your pay check
The sales climb high through the garbage pail sky
Like a giant dildo crushing the sun

That's why
I pay no mind
Sleep in slime
I just got signed
So get out your lead pipe pipe dreams
Get out your ten-foot flags
The insects are huge
And the poison's all been used
And the drugs won't kill your day job
Honey

That's why
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
That's why
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind
I pay no mind1Embed
