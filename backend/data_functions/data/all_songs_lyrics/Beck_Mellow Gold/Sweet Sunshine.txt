Sweet Sunshine Lyrics
Judge me on the inside with a finger full of gravy
Want to get you on the sofa, lady, want to shake and bake me

Bucket full of blood, gotcha on my mind
I'm gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
Bucket full of blood, gotcha on my mind
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine

I want to get up off the floor
I wanna run to the Devil and get me some more
I want to get up off the floor
I wanna run to the Devil and get me some more

Hollow full of bread with your husband screaming
We are skunk and soul and I found it on a screaming

Grab your wine, tell me when you been
With the violin crime and the moon gettin' thin
Grab your wine, tell me where you been
With the violin comin' and the moon gettin' thin
I want to climb up on the rug
I want to swing through the city on a wrecking ball
I want to climb up on the rug
I want to swing through the city on a wrecking ball

Lay on to the dawning of the pitiful sensation
Cause the diamond full of salad and I kill my master nation

Got a bucket full of blood, gotcha on my mind
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine
Bucket full of blood, gotcha on my mind
Gonna break my face on the sweet sunshine

I want to get up off the floor
I wanna run to the Devil and get me some more
I want to get up off the floor
I wanna run to the Devil and get me some more

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeahEmbed
