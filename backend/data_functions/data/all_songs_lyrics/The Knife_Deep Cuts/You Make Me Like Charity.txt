You Make Me Like Charity Lyrics
You try to feel it but you can't wake up
You try to touch it but you can't wake up
You're holding ice and you don't wake up
Increase the size and you don't wake up
I do it backwards but I don't wake up
Try to reverse but I don't wake up
I sit astride but I still don't wake up

More than a second
When reading the newspaper
I felt the war
I felt her exposed position
I saw myself in the picture and I

I took a cab there to hold her
I took a plane there to feel what she felt
You make me like charity
Instead of paying enough taxes4Embed
