Pass This On LyricsI'm in love with your brother
What's his name?
I thought I'd come by
To see him again
And when you two danced
Oh, what a dance
And when you two laughed
Oh, what a laugh
Has he mentioned my age love?
Or is he more into young girls with dyed-black hair?
I'm in love with your brother
I thought I'd come by
I'm in love with your brother
Yes I am
But maybe I shouldn't ask for his name
And you danced
Oh, what a dance
And you laughed
Oh, what a laugh
Does he know what I do?
And you'll pass this on, won't you?
And if I asked him once what would he say?
Is he willing?
Can he play?
I wasn’t really looking for some more than
Some company on the dance floor
And does he know what I do?
And you’ll pass this on, won’t you?
And I wasn’t really looking for some more than
Some company on the dance floor
And does he know what I do?
(If I asked him once, what would he say?)
And you'll pass this on, won't you?
(Is he willing? Can he play?)
Does he know what I do?
And you'll pass this on, won't you?
And if I asked him once what would he say?
Is he willing?
Can he play?
I wasn’t really looking for some more than
Some company on the dance floor
And does he know what I do?
And you’ll pass this on, won’t you?
And I wasn’t really looking for some more than
Some company on the dance floor
And does he know what I do?
And you'll pass this on, won't you?10Embed
