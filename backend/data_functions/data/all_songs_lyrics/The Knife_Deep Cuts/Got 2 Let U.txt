Got 2 Let U LyricsI got to, got to let you down
But in an hour, I will change my mind
I got to, got to let you down
But in an hour, I will change my mind
It is like magic to me
Making mistakes and be forgiven easily
It is like magic to me
Making mistakes and be forgiven e-easy-easily
I know she lets me down
But just for a short while
Then she changes her mind
I know she lets me down
But just for a short while
Then she changes her mind
She does it all the time
Making mistakes
And then I'll ease her mind
She does it all the time
But she's so pretty
And I don't mind
I got to, got to let you down
But in an hour I will change my mind
It is like magic to me
Making mistakes and be forgiven e-easy-easily
I got to let you down
Got to let you down
I got to let you down
Got to let you down
I know she lets me down
But just for a short while
Then she changes her mind
I know she lets me down
But just for a short while
Then she changes her mind
She does it all the time
Making mistakes
And then I'll ease her mind
She does it all the time
But she's so pretty
And I don't mind
She does it all the time
Making mistakes
And then I'll ease her mind
She does it all the time
But she's so pretty
And I don't mind
(Got to let you down) She does it all the time
(Got to let you down) Making mistakes
And then I'll ease her mind
(Got to let you down) She does it all the time
(Got to let you down) But she's so pretty
And I don't mind2Embed
