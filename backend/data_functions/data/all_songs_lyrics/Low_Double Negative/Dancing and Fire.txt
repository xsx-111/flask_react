Dancing and Fire Lyrics
I saw you dancing in the "fire it up"
Before your breath and barely audible
It's more a "let it out" than "let it go"
It's not the end, it's just the end of hope

A spark of everything you've ever known
Incinerated in a light of gold
You don't know what you're even fighting for
It's not the first time you delayed the boat

I saw you dancing in the "fire it up"
Before your breath and barely audible
It's more a "let it out" than "let it go"
It's not the end, it's just the end of hopeEmbed
