Disarray Lyrics
Before it falls into total disarray
You'll have to learn to live a different way
Too late to look back on apocryphal verse
And to be something beyond kinder than words

This evil spirit, man, it's bringing me down
It tells me not to do the things that I should
It graduated to the back of the bus
They say you let it in when you took the drugs

Not up for question, it's not even a thought
Another portrait you can hang on the wall
Dissolve into a state of awful inverse
The truth is not something that you have not heard

This evil spirit, man, it's bringing me down
It tells me not to do the things that I should
It graduated to the back of the bus
They say you let it in when you took the drugs2Embed
