Always Up LyricsAlways up
Must be tough
Temptation
Frustration
Turn it out
Break it down
Mistaken
Unshaken
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see, can't you see
I believe, I believe, I believe, I believe
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see, can't you see
I see it
Hearts trailing
What you so
Afraid ofEmbed
