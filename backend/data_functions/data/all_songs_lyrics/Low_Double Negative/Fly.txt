Fly LyricsI thought we had it made up
After all we had to pay up
Keep it knocking on the cellar
That's no way to earn a dollar
But I don't know
And I don't mind
Leave my weary bones
And fly
You're telling me just one more
I keep it like it's torture
Keep my body like a soldier
You gotta tell me when it's over
But I don't know
And I don't mind
Take my weary bones
And fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
Fly
