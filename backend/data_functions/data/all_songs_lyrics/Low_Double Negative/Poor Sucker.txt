Poor Sucker LyricsSome poor sucker
At the bottom of the lake
Took the wrong way up
When the ground began to break
It's a long way back
That's the price you gotta pay
Should've this, should've that
Should've made a list to thank
Should have kept a better track
Put some money in the bank
If your mind's made up
Then there's nothing left to say
All you've given, all you took
All your promise, all your rules
After all you've done
Feed your body to the wolves
It's a lie, it's the truth
Only one thing you can do
You got everything you want
There ain't nothing else to take
Kick your ass right out
What the hell you gonna say
Gonna give it to you fast
Gonna give it to you straight
Yeah, you gonna make him wait
Gonna put you in your place
Gonna leave you in the dark
At the bottom of the lake
It's a long way back
That's the price you gotta pay
All you've given, all you took
All your promise, all your rules
After all you've done
Feed your body to the wolves
It's a lie, it's the truth
Only one thing you can do1Embed
