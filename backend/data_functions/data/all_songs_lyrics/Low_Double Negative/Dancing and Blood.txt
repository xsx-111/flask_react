Dancing and Blood Lyrics
What could I say?
Taken aback
All that you gave
Wasn't enough

What could I say?
Taken aback
All that you gave
Chasing the line
Tear in the cut
It's inside
Keep in the know
Throw in the earth
Dancing and blood

What could I say?
Taken aback
All that you gave
Wasn't enough2Embed
