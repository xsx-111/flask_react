Rome (Always in the Dark) Lyrics
Rome in the ashes
Couldn't even sigh
Even when they have
To make a roundabout
You were higher water
It's happens in the soul
They can fake derision
If we're one and whole

Always in the dark

Rome in the ashes
Couldn't even sigh
Who will even have
To wait the last in line
I got magic water
You can have it all
Let's turn this thing up
Before they take us out

Always in the dark
Rome in the ashes
Couldn't even sigh
Who can make a panic
At the end of night
Warmness that happens
Then they tear you up
Whisper to me crosseyed
If you kill that bird

Always in the dark1Embed
