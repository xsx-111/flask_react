Always Trying to Work It Out LyricsI saw you at the grocery store, I know
I should have walked over and said hello
It seemed like you were in a hurry
I didn't want to slow you down so
I figured I should let you go
Always trying to work it out (Work it out)
Always trying to work it out (Work it out)
See the little children at your knees
I heard you moved back and got a house at East
Everybody says that the war is over
It isn't something you forget so easily
Saw your shit downtown at the gallery
Always trying to work it out (Work it out)
Always trying to work it out (Work it out)
Always trying to work it out (Work it out)
Work it out
Always trying to work it out (Work it out)
Work it out
Always trying to work it out (Work it out)Embed
