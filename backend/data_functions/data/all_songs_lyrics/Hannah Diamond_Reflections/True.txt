True Lyrics
The risks you took
So when I looked
I wouldn't see for a while
I saw the signs
Bright flashing lights
I closed my eyes for a while

Didn’t see you at my show
Never told me yes or no

I look in your eyes, I see right through
I know that you've found someone new
Why would you lie? What should I do?
Now I know it's not true

Like a diamond being crushed, you’ve turned my heart to dust
You say the words but your face doesn't match up

I checked in, you're checking out
Holding up lies so we can make out
I look in your eyes, I see right through
I know that you've found someone new
Why would you lie? What should I do?
Now I know it's not true
Now that I know it's not true
Now that you've found someone new
Now that I know what to do

I don't need you (Don’t need you)
No, I don’t (No, I don't)
Now I know it’s not true
No epiphanies
No "believe in me"'s
No more chances wasted on nobodies
Every time you lie, you become that guy
There's no point, there's no time
Maybe you’ll treat her right

No, it's not true
I always knew (Always knew)
But now I know it's not true
