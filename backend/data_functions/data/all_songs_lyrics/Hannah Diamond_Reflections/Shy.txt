Shy Lyrics
You said: "What's wrong?"
I said: "Nothing"
Nothing's really
Sometimes, something

Took my time to figure out what's truly real
Told myself it's wrong to fake the way I feel

But I'm still shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy

You said: "Let's kiss"
I said nothing
Maybe, I should have
Said something

Took my time to figure out what's truly real
Told myself it's wrong to fake the way I feel
But I'm still shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy

Things that I did
Faded away
Just cause I didn't
Know when to say
"I like you"

Took my time to figure out what's truly real
Told myself it's wrong to fake the way I feel

But I'm still shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy
I-I-I'm so-so
