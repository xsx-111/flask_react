Invisible Lyrics
When I saw you with her
When I saw you kissing her
I can't get that picture out of my mind
When I am around you
I could be invisible
Do you wish I wasn't even there, sometimes?

See right through, what you do
Deep down, I know she's with you and so

I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, and so
I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own

So invisible
Am I invisible?
Am I invisible?
Am I invisible?
I'd go out and party
But I'm scared of what I'll see
So I'll stay home tonight
And every night
I wanted to tell you
But I couldn't make a sound
Maybe if you heard me
You'd see me now

See right through, what you do
Deep down I know she's with you and so

I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, and so
I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own

So invisible
Am I invisible?
You don't know that I'm here
On my own
I was born on my own
And I'll dance on my own
No, no, no
You don't know that I'm here
On my own
I was born on my own
And I'll dance on my own
No, no, no

I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, and so
I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, and so
I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own

So invisible
Am I invisible?
Am I invisible?2Embed
