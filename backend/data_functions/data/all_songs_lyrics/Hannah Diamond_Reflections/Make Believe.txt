Make Believe Lyrics
I could draw pictures of you, baby
(Oh-oh)
I got your face in a book, baby
(Oh-oh)
It's like you're with me inside my head
Whenever I miss you I see you there
I want to take you along with me
Don't go now

Do you look at me?
I look at you
You say the words
I want to hear
You hold my hand
I shed a tear
I close my eyes
Thinkin' of you
You make it real
And I believe
'Cause when you speak
Visions appear
You look at me
I look at you
You say the words
I love you
(Ooh-ooh)
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you, with you
(Ooh-ooh)
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you, with you

I could get so lost with you, baby
(Oh-oh)
I've got a daydream for two, baby
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You could be with me all of the time
We'll never be lonely inside my mind
I want to take you along with me
Don't go now

Do you look at me?
I look at you
You say the words
I want to hear
You hold my hand
I shed a tear
I close my eyes
Thinkin' of you
You make it real
And I believe
'Cause when you speak
Visions appear
You look at me
I look at you
You say the words
I love you
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you, with you
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you, with you

I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you, with you
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you
With you

(Ooh-ooh)
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you, with you
(Ooh-ooh)
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you, with youEmbed
