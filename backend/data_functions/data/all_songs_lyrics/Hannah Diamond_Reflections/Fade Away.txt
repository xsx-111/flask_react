Fade Away Lyrics
Maybe you've given up
Maybe it's just my luck
Wish we could talk things through
Wish I could click undo

Don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone, and then you'll see
If it's me you like
Or the way I make you feel
Alive, but so dead inside
Are we just a memory
Already fading?
Already fading

Day after day
You fade away from me
Baby, please
Just stay, don't fade away

I always thought I'd be
The picture saved on your screen
Now it's of something else
What does that even mean?
Don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone and then you'll see
If it's me you like
Or the way I make you feel
Alive
But so dead inside
Are we just a memory
Already fading?
Already fading

Day after day
You fade away from me
Baby, please
Just stay, don't fade away

Fade away from me
Fade away from me
Fade away from me
Fade away from me
Fade away from me
Fade away from me
Fade away from me
Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Day after day
You fade away from me
Baby, please
Just stay, don't fade away

Fade away from me
Fade away from me
Fade away from me
Fade away from me2Embed
