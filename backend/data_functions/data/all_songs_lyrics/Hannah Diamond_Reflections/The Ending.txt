The Ending Lyrics
Bo-boy, stop pretending
This can't be the ending
You know that I like you
Much more than a friend, see
You said that you've been thinking
Things need time to sink in
But when I'm without you
I can't stop my heart sinking

Going or gone
You're going or going or gone
You're going or going or gone
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone
Going or gone, gone, gone
You're going or going or gone
You're going or going or gone
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone

Can't sleep, (can't sleep)
Where are you?
Can't stop thinking about (What we've been through)
Every night I close my eyes but I'm awake
('Cause all the dreams we had, you took away)
Got your text, you say we're done
But I know what you're like
It's not over yet
Boy, stop pretending
This can't be the ending
You know that I like you
Much more than a friend, see
You said that you've been thinking
Things need time to sink in
B-but when I'm without you
I can't stop my heart sinking

Going or gone
You're going or going or gone
You're going or going or gone
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone
Going or gone, gone, gone
You're going or going or gone
You're going or going or gone
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone

Made your choice (Your choice)
Can't hear my voice (Goodbye)
You'll miss me when you're gone
(Now you're gone)
You made me feel loved (feel loved)
Like how it feels in a movie
Now it's a film I don't wanna see
First it's off and then it's on
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone
Boy, stop pretending
This can't be the ending
You know that I like you
Much more than a friend, see
You said that you've been thinking
Things need time to sink in
But when I'm without you
I can't stop my heart sinking

Stop my heart sinking (Stop my heart sinking)
Stop my heart sinking (Stop my heart sinking)
Stop my heart sinking
Stop my heart sinking
Stop my heart sinking

(Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going)
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going or going or gone
Coming or going or going2Embed
