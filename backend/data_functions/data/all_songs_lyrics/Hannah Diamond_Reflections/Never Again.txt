Never Again Lyrics
You were the end, the beginning
The one I found myself wishing wouldn't fade away
You were the light in the darkness
You made me laugh and cry harder than I can explain

Was I just there when you were lonely?
I felt how you thought it should feel to hold me
How could you give me something that wasn't there?
Wasn't there
Why don't you care?

Never wanna hear you a- (a-)
Apologize again
(Apologize again)
Never wanna see that look (look)
That look in your eyes again
Said you were sorry
You weren't though
Said you had told me
But still you
Lied every time that I listened
Out of the rain
Never again
I let you into my life, never really opened my eyes
So you'd look out for me
You said the words, I believed you
But now you're leaving me thinking they don't mean a thing

Was I just there when you were lonely?
I felt how you thought it should feel to hold me
How could you give me something that wasn't there?
Wasn't there
Why don't you care?

Never wanna hear you a- (a-)
Apologize again
(Apologize again)
Never wanna see that look (look)
That look in your eyes again
(Said you)
Said you were sorry
You weren't though
Said you had told me
But still you
Lied every time that I listened
Out of the rain
Never again
Never wanna see that look
The look in your eyes again
Never wanna hear you a-
Apologize again
Said you were sorry
You weren't though
Said you had told me
But still you
Lied every time that I listened
Over and over again
Never wanna hear you a- (a-)
Apologize again
(Apologize again)
Never wanna see that look (look)
That look in your eyes again

Said you were sorry
You weren't though
Said you had told me
But still you
Lied every time that I listened
Out of the rain
Never again
Said you were sorry
You weren't though
Said you had told me
But still you
Lied every time that I listened
Out of the rain (-ver again)
Never again
Said you were sorry
You weren't though
Said you had told me
But still you
Lied every time that I listened
Out of the rain (-ver again)
Never again
