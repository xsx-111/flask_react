Love Goes On Lyrics
Maybe I'm good on my own
Could it be time to let go?
Sometimes I wanna believe in you
Then I remember it's you (Oh-oh)

How did it end up like this? (Oh-oh)
Gone with the wind like a kiss (Oh-oh)
Breaking my heart just to try (Oh-oh)
Staying alive 'til I die

And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on

And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
Sometimes it's hard on my own
Falling asleep by the phone
Sometimes it feels like I'm missing you
Then I remember it's you (Oh-oh)

What if we just hadn't met? (Oh-oh)
Is it so hard to forget? (Oh-oh)
Breaking my heart just to try (Oh-oh)
Staying alive 'til I die

And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on

And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on

I went out tonight
I cried once or twice
I met someone new
But he's not like you
And I kissed his face
In a different place
And he's not the one
But my love goes on
I went out tonight
I cried once or twice
I met someone new
But he's not like you
And I kissed his face
In a different place
And he's not the one
But my love goes on


And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes onEmbed
