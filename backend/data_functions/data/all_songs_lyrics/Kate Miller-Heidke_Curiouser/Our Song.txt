Our Song Lyrics
Sometimes when the sky is clear blue
Sometimes I can hear you singing to me
But lately part of me just crumbles
Every time I hear that melody

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Our song

It doesn't matter if your heart's new broken
If we haven't spoken in a year
You'll be walking somewhere very far away
Where the sky is full grey and you will hear

Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Our song

And for a moment you can hold it
And the colors all come back
Like the smell of spring on a shifting wind
Our song
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Our song
