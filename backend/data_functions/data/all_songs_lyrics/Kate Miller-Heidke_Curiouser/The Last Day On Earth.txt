The Last Day On Earth Lyrics
Look down
The ground below is crumbling
Look up
The stars are all exploding

It's the last day on earth
In my dreams, in my dreams
It's the end of the world
And you've come back to me in my dreams

Between
The dust and the debris
There's a light
Surrounding you and me

It's the last day on earth
In my dreams, in my dreams
It's the end of the world
And you've come back to me in my dreams

And you hold me closer than
I can ever remember being held
And I'm not afraid to sleep now
If we can stay like this until...
It's the last day on earth
In my dreams, in my dreams
It's the end of the world
And you've come back to me

In my head I replay our conversations
Over and over 'til they feel like hallucinations
You know me, I love to lose my mind
And every time anybody speaks your name
I still feel the same
I ache, I ache, I ache inside

In my head I replay our conversations
Over and over 'til they feel like hallucinations
You know me, I love to lose my mind
And every time anybody speaks your name
(It's the last...)
I still feel the same
I ache, I ache, I ache inside
I ache, I ache, I ache inside
(...day on earth)
I ache, I ache, I ache inside
I ache, I ache, I ache inside2Embed
