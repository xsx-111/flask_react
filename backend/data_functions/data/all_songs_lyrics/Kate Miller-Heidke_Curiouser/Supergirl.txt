Supergirl Lyrics
Hands in the air for Supergirl! She goes her own way
Hands in the air for Supergirl! She's doing alright
Hands in the air for Supergirl! She goes her own way
Hands in the air for Supergirl! She's doing alright

You're doing it your own way
Walking with your own sway
Smiling into a cloudy day
And I want you to know
How you helped me to grow
I just wanted to say
Marieke, Marieke
Marieke, you're okay

Hands in the air for Supergirl! She buys sex toys
Hands in the air for Supergirl! She's a bit of alright
Hands in the air for Supergirl! She like the Beastie Boys
Hands in the air for Supergirl! She's a bit of alright

You're doing it your own way
Walking with your own sway
Smiling into a cloudy day
And I want you to know
How you helped me to grow
I just wanted to say
Marieke, Marieke
Marieke, you're okay
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Supergirl!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Supergirl!

She's fiercely independent
And she doesn't need cosmopolitan
To tell her where she fits in
Throw her off the deep end
And she'll only swim again
She's never reach her wits' end
She's a true believer
It's not Jessica but Lisa
When it comes to choosing Simpsons
Smart as Sgt. Pepper
Gets by with a little help
Gets by with a little help from her friends

Ay, Marieke, Marieke
Marieke, you're okay
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Supergirl!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Supergirl!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Hands in the air for Supergirl!)
Supergirl!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
(Hands in the air for Supergirl!)
Supergirl!
Hands in the air for Supergirl!Embed
