Motorscooter Lyrics
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom

I heard you pulling up outside
And my whole body got to tingling
Then there were footsteps on the stairs
And then the doorbell got to ring-a-ling
And I am happy just to see you
Oh yes, you're really very nice
But all I really wanna get on is your bike

Let me take a ride
On your motorscooter
I wanna take a ride
On your motorscooter

Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
Every time I see you it's like I'm in Quadrophenia
I'm a mod again
I hold on tight to your Italian leather jacket
And I sniff it in
And I know it's not that cool
You're so metrosexual
But I can't help it, I'm in love (with your bicycle)

Let me take a ride
On your motorscooter
I wanna take a ride
On your motorscooter

Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom

Didons, ma puce, on est vachement chouette
La, en promenade sur ta mobilette
Mais quoi? On arrette? On arrette? Je viens
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
(Oh, won't you let me take a ride?)
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
(Come on and let me take a ride)
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
(Oh, won't you let me take a ride?)
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
(Come on and let me take a ride)
Vroom, vroom, vroom
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
(Oh, won't you let me take a ride?)Embed
