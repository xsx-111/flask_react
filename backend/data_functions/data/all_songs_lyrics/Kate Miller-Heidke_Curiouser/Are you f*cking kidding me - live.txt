Are you f*cking kidding me - live LyricsThe say everyone should have their heart broken at least once
That is how you grow emotionally
Well I have been misused by many-many-many men
But nothing can compare to how you treated me
At times it really felt as though the pain was here to stay
And though it's many years ago I feel it to this day
And now
You wanna be my friend on Facebook
Are you fucking kidding me?
All the memories are flooding back to me now
All the ways you stole the light from my eyes
I traveled so far just to get away from you
'Til this morning's friend request surprise
At times it really felt as though I'd never smile again
You narcissistic arsehole
Oh you nasty, nasty man
And now
You wanna be my friend on Facebook
Are you fucking kidding me?
I don't wanna know what kind of cocktail you are
Or which member of the Beatles
Or which 1960s movie star
I don't give a toss if you're a ninja or a pirate
I'd suspect you'd be a pirate
But I don't wanna verify it
And I don't give a shit what your stripper name is
Or if your kitty had a litter
Look â€“ just follow me on twitter
I don't care about your family tree
And I certainly don't want you poking me (again)
And so you wanna be my friend on Facebook
Oh you fucking, fucking fuck
