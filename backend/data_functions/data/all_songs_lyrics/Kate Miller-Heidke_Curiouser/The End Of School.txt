The End Of School Lyrics
I remember the end of school
Felt like the start of something bigger
Bigger than the sky at night in your big backyard
When your parents were gone and we were drinking a cask

Getting bent in Lake Annand Park
Making out when the streets got darker
After midnight we'd follow the road
Walk all night just to see where it goes

Yeah, you could say that we were stupid then
That we didn't know anything
But we knew all we had to know
Yeah, 'cause we knew that we were friends
And then that was everything
And there were no tomorrows
Just the end of school

In the lounge room scrounging for cash
Hanging 'round for a party to crash
Sitting in a group, kicking dirt in the gutter
Getting kicked out of bars and wishing we were older
Yeah, you could say that we were stupid then
That we didn't know anything
But we knew all we had to know
Yeah, 'cause we knew that we were friends
And then that was everything
And there were no tomorrows
Just the end of school

I remember the end of school
Choking on a cigarette
Cramming into your car on the weekend
Jumping off the rocks right into the deep end

Yeah, 'cause we knew that we were friends
And then that was everything
And there were no tomorrows
Just the end of school
Just the end of school

Just the end of school
(Sitting in a group, kicking dirt in the gutter
Riding in your car wishing we were older)
Just the end of school
(Hanging in the park when the streets got darker
Feeling like the start of something bigger)
Just the end of school
(Felt like the start of something bigger
Felt like the start of something bigger)
Just the end of school
(Felt like the start of something bigger
Felt like the start of something bigger)Embed
