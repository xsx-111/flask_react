For The Hundredth Time Lyrics
I'm telling you, you're the only one
I'm telling you every day I say
You're all that I want, all that I want
I cannot replace
Just because I may want to be alone
Or hanging 'round with my friends
Doesn't mean to say, is not to say
That I am not content
But you take it to heart
Well, I remain unfailingly stable
This is where it starts

So I'll tell you, tell you
Tell you for the hundredth time
I still love you, I still love to tell you
Tell you, tell you that you're first in line
I'm not bored and I don't want more
You somehow got the picture
That you're getting in the way
Just caught me in the middle of a difficult day
And for the hundredth time
I tell you, tell you, tell you that you're mine

Did Antoni and Cleopatra ever feel this way?
Did Elizabeth Taylor's suitors fail to give the lady space?
Did Adolf and Avis struggle to find the common ground?
Well, pardon the pun
But gravity somehow always gets me down
And then you start to whine
That's your kampf not mein
So I'll tell you, tell you
Tell you for the hundredth time
I still love you, I still love to tell you
Tell you, tell you that you're first in line
I'm not bored and I don't want more
You somehow got the picture
That you're getting in the way
Just caught me in the middle of a difficult day
So for the hundredth time
I tell you, tell you, tell you that you're mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

Just because I'm irritated every time you speak
Just because the monotone
Of your voice gives me the creeps
When I see your smile, I start to taste bile
But how could you ever construe to me
That I do not love you?
So come on, honey-pie
Smoochy, lovely, cuddly, darling?
Would I tell a lie?

But I'll tell you, tell you
Tell you for the hundredth time
I still love you, I still love to tell you
Tell you, tell you that you're first in line
I'm not bored and I don't want more
You somehow got the picture
That you're getting in the way
Just caught me in the middle of a difficult day
So for the hundredth time, for the millionth time
I tell you, tell you, tell you that you're mineEmbed
