No Truck Lyrics
Oh oh, wait a minute, not so quick
You go from zero to ticked off and losing it
Could somebody please tell me what just happened then?

Manage to always ruin the mood somehow
Well, I'm over-combing through the details now
Far too complicated to bother with it

All you people, gather 'round and listen up
His majesty the baby has got something up
His bottle's empty and his nappy's come unstuck
All the kingdom must shut up

Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn
But I'm not as young as I used to be
And you live and you learn
Forgive me if I'm pushing on my luck
But I've been through this a million times
And now I'll have no truck with it, no truck
No truck

Yeah, we all got luggage and we all got scars
But I'll know for a fact it shouldn't be this hard
I've seen it on Dr. Phil, I know all about it
And no, I'm not mad, I just don't wanna play
I know the script and I hate that game
Think his majesty, the baby is overtired

All you people, gather 'round and listen up
His majesty the baby has got something up
His bottle's empty and his nappy's come unstuck
All the kingdom must shut up

Forgive me if I'm speaking out of turn
But I'm not as young as I used to be
And you live and you learn
Forgive me if I'm pushing on my luck
But I've been through this a million times
And now I'll have no truck with it, no truck
No truck, now I'll have no truck
No truck, now I'll have no truck
