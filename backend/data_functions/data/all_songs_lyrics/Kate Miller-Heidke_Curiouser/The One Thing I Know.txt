The One Thing I Know Lyrics
Our astrology will prove
My love it's true
I'll never get enough of you
Endless as a desert sky
My hunger for the fire
That gathers in your eyes

Shine, shining in the light
Shine, shining in the light

One thing, the one thing
The one thing I know
The one thing I know to be true
I'll never, I'll never wherever I go
I'll never finish loving you, ooh
I'll never finish loving you

We could run away tonight
Just you and I
Oh, leaving everything behind
A moving rhythm in my heart
We can see the future
Following the stars
Shine, shining in the light
Shine, shining in the light

One thing, the one thing
The one thing I know
The one thing I know to be true
I'll never, I'll never wherever I go
I'll never finish loving you, ooh
I'll never finish loving...

Come, oh, come closer
Come, oh, come closer
Come, oh, come closer
Come, oh, come closer

One thing, the one thing
The one thing I know
The one thing I know to be true
I'll never, I'll never wherever I go
I'll never finish loving you, ooh
I'll never finish loving you
One thing, the one thing
The one thing I know
The one thing I know to be true
I'll never, I'll never wherever I go
I'll never finish loving you, ooh
I'll never finish loving youEmbed
