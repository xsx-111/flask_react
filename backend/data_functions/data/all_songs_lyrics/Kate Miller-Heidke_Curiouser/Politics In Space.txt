Politics In Space Lyrics
I'm not gonna state my case anymore
'Cause I haven't got a leg to stand on
I'm not gonna take the leap anymore
'Cause I got no mat to land on
I'm not gonna smoke that shit anymore
It will only get me thinking
And I better not paddle upstream anymore
'Cause this canoe is sinking
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no

Are you alright? Pretty much
Are you okay? Pretty much
You got your health? Pretty much
You know the way? Pretty much
You know your limit? Pretty much
You understand? Pretty much
Are you the man? Pretty much
Pretty much, pretty much

Citizens don't stand up anymore
There's no point losing face
Sound off, 1, 2, 3, 4
Politics in space
I'm not gonna be polite anymore
'Cause everybody's got bad manners
I'm not gonna make any plans anymore
'Cause the works are full of spanners
I'm not gonna meditate anymore
The revolution is off the agenda
I'm a baby boomer's daughter
And I'm never gonna reach nirvana
No, no, no, no, no, no
(Nevermind)
No, no, no, no, no, no

Are you alright? Pretty much
Are you okay? Pretty much
You got your health? Pretty much
You know the way? Pretty much
You know your limit? Pretty much
You understand? Pretty much
Are you the man? Pretty much
Pretty much, pretty much

Citizens don't stand up anymore
There's no point losing face
Sound off, 1, 2, 3, 4
Politics in space
The sixties were 50 years ago
You know, get over it

Are you alright? Pretty much
Are you okay? Pretty much
You got your health? Pretty much
You know the way? Pretty much
You know your limit? Pretty much
You understand? Pretty much
Are you the man? Pretty much
Pretty much, pretty much

Citizens don't stand up anymore
There's no point losing face
Sound off, 1, 2, 3, 4
Politics in space
(It's alright, nevermind
Don't worry about it
Just figured out something
Seriously, nothing
Nothing)
(I don't understand it)
No, noEmbed
