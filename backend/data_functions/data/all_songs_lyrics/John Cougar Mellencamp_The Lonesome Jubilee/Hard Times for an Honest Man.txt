Hard Times for an Honest Man Lyrics
One man
Does his work
He's not satisfied
Not at all
Feels like
That he's being used (Being used)
His self respect starts to fall
His frustration
Runnin' very very high
He takes it out
On the ones he loves
Because it's safe (It's safe)
And who they gonna tell
And he hates the cold-bloodedness
That runs inside

Oh yes
It's hard times (Hard times)
For an honest man (For an honest man)
Very very very hard times
Hard times (Hard times)
For an honest man (For an honest man)
Very very very hard times
Sister (Sister)
She's got a lot of pride (A lot of pride)
You can see it when she walks into the room
But she's young (She's young)
And she's unaware
Of what a brutal world can do to you
So she loves a man
Lies like a dog
Tears her little world all apart
So the walls go up (Walls go up)
For the rest of her days
And there ain't no man can touch this girl's heart

Oh yes
It's hard times (Hard times)
For an honest man (For an honest man)
Very very very hard times
Hard times (Hard times)
For an honest man (For an honest man)
Very very very hard times

Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
So we walk
From the front porch to the back yard
Just to laugh and say hello and say goodbye
But some days are hard, like a soldier's steel-toed boots
And the rent we pay to stay here gets high

Oh yes
It's hard times (Hard times)
For an honest man (For an honest man)
Very very very hard times
Hard times (Hard times)
For an honest man (For an honest man)
Very very very hard times (Say it again now)
Hard times (Hard times)
For an honest man (For an honest man)
Very very very hard times
Hard times (Hard times)
For an honest man (For an honest man)
Very very very hard times

Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey heyEmbed
