Blues from the Front Porch LyricsWell it's another hot day
In Lima, Mississippi
Evan played the harmonica
And the old group sang
Some are laughin', some are crying'
Most are still relyin' on the old (damn tar)
Yeah in Shannon County
No one's overworked today
There ain't no use to
So they took our dignity and ran away
Well who we are
And we what we achieve
When it comes to (cruzmitat)
Well maybe someone will believe
In Shannon County
Here in the Midwest
Farm prices are a slow burn
Well I know it ain't my fault
So I reckon it must be my turn
Aimless days
Empty future
Whose got the fizzle
You know we ain't no quitters here
In the county
Just keep a talkin'
Do you know what I mean?
You can keep all those big deals
Don't take away our reason to believe
We can work and we feel
And plant your farm in green
Send soldiers in the world
(And peace signs) keep our dream
We'll just keep on talkin'Embed
