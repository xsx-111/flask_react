We Are the People Lyrics
If you're feelin' shut down
May my thoughts be with you
If you're a black man bein' beat down and shoved all around
May my thoughts be with you
If your world's gettin' a little too tough
You know our thoughts are with you
Hey, I know that it's crazy out there
And my thoughts are with you

We are the people
And we live forever
We are the people
And our future's written on the wind
On the wind

If you are one of the homeless
May our thoughts be with you
If you are scared and alone
You know our thoughts are with you
If you are one of the fortunate ones
We all know it's lonely up there
We understand that nobody's got it made
So our thoughts are with you
We are the people, oh yeah
And we live forever
We are the people
And our future's written on the wind
On the wind

You see yourself as a leader
May my thoughts be with you
If you try to divide and conquer
We'll rise up against you
We know only the strong will survive
But the meek will inherit
So if you've got a coat of arms, oh friend
I suggest we wear it

We are the people
And we live forever
We are the people
Oh and our future's written on the wind
On the wind, yeahEmbed
