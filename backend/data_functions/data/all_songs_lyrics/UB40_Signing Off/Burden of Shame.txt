Burden of Shame LyricsThere are murders that we must account for
Bloody deeds have been done in my name
Criminal acts we must pay for
And our children will shoulder the blame
(chorus)
I'm a British subject not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame (repeat)
As a nation we follow in blindness
No one stops to question why
Our money's supporting an army
And a boy in Soweto dies
(chorus)
I'm a British subject not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame (repeat)
Must we go on ignoring forever
The cries of an African son
There's a soldier's hand on a trigger
But it's we who are pointing the gun
(chorus)
I'm a British subject not proud of it
While I carry the burden of shame (repeat)Embed
