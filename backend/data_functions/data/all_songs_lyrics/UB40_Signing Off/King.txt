King LyricsKing, where are your people now?
Chained and pacified
Tried in vain to show them how
And for that you died
You had a dream of a promised land
People of all nations walking hand in hand
But they're not ready to accept
That dream situation, yet
King, where are your people now?
Chained and pacified
Tried in vain to show them how
And for that you died1Embed
