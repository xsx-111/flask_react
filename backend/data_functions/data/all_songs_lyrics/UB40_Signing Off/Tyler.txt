Tyler LyricsAppeal to the governor, of Louisiana
You may get an answer the process is slow
Federal court won, too much to open
He's been there for five years and they won't let him go
(Chorus)
Tyler is guilty white judges said so
What right do we got to say it's not so
Tyler is guilty white judges said so
What right do we got to say it's not so
(saxophone chorus)
Testify under pressure, a racist jury
Government lawyers it's all for sure
Rows of white faces, false accusations
He's framed up for murder, they won't let him go
(Chorus)
His gun was planted, no matching bullets
No points on the handle, no proof to show
But Tyler, is guilty, the white judges said so
They show him no mercy they won't let him go
(Chorus)
Appeal to the governor, of Louisiana
You may get an answer, the process is slow
Federal court won, too much to open
He's been there for five years, they won't let him go
(Chorus X 2)
Tyler is guilty, white judges said so
They show him no mercy, they won't let him go
Tyler is guilty, white judges said so
They show him no mercy, they won't let him goEmbed
