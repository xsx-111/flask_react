Sahara LyricsA ballad of a dark queen echoes through night
As he flees the curse of gods, the pharaoh's wrath

1001 nights unseen
The philosopher and the queen
Ancient mariner in a sea of sand
The burning beauty his tomb to die for

Horizon's swarming with death
Run!
Heaven has a darkened face
Dunes are soaring, as on a chase
Caravan of the cursed
Chasing him across the waves
May he now rest under aegis of mirage
As the sands slowly turn to Elysian fields?
