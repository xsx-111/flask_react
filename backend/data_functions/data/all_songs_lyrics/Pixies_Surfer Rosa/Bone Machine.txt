Bone Machine Lyrics
This is a song for Carol!

You were working Japanese fast food
And I dropped you off with your Japanese lover
And you're going to the beach all day
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me
You're so pretty when you're unfaithful to me

You're looking like you've got some sun
Your blistered lips have got a kiss
That tastes a bit like everyone
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!

Your bone's got a little machine
(Aaaah!)
You're the bone machine
(Aaaah!)

I was talking to preachy-preach about kissy-kiss
He bought me a soda, he bought me a soda
He bought me a soda and he tried to molest me in the parking lot
Yep, yep, yep, yep!
I make you pray, you make me hard
Your Irish skin looks Mexican
Our love is rice and beans and horse's lard

Your bone's got a little machine
(Aaaah!)
You're the bone machine

Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-oh!

Your bone's got a little machine5Embed
