Secret Door (Synthesis) LyricsTurn out the lights
Feed the fire till my soul breaks free
My heart is high as the waves above me
Don't need to understand
Too lost to lose
Don't fight my tears cause they feel so good
And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back
Through the same secret door
Look past the end
It's a dream, as it's always been
All life lives on if we've ever loved it
And I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back
Through the same secret door
I, I will remember how to fly
Unlock the heavens in my mind
Follow my love back
Through the same secret doorEmbed
