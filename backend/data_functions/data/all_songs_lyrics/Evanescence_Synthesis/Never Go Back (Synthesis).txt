Never Go Back (Synthesis) LyricsEverything is so dark
And I know there's something wrong
But I can't turn the light on
In that split second change
When you knew we couldn't hold on
I realize I live to love you
Save yourself, don’t look back
Tearing us apart until it's
All gone
The only world I've ever known
Sleeps beneath the waves
But I remember
I won't give up on you
I can feel you in my heart
Just show me the way
I don't belong here alone
I can still see your face
Where it's burned into my mind
I die every time I close my eyes
You're always there
Save yourself, don’t look back
Tearing us apart until it's
All gone
The only world I've ever known
Sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who’s drowning
Without your love I am lost
And I can never go back home
All across the ocean
We are calling, calling
Are you there?
Nothing left for me till I find you
Because it's all gone
The only one world I've ever known
Sleeps beneath the waves
But I'm the one who’s drowning
Without your love I am lost
And I can never go back
I can never go back home1Embed
