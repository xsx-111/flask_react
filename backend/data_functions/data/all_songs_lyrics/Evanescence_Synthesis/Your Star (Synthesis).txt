Your Star (Synthesis) LyricsI can't see your star
I can't see your star
Though I patiently waited
Bedside for the death of today
I can't see your star
The mechanical lights of Lisbon frightened it away
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out
I can't see your star
I can't see your star
How can the darkness feel so wrong?
And I'm alone now
Me and all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces, swim lonely
Find your own way out
So far away
It's growing colder
Without your love
Why can't you feel me
Calling your name?
Can't break the silence
It's breaking me
All my fears turn to rage
And I'm alone now, me
And all I stood for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way out
Nothing worth fighting for
We're wandering now
All in parts and pieces swim lonely
Find your own way outEmbed
