Lacrymosa (Synthesis) LyricsI can't change who I am
Out on your own
Cold and alone again
Can this be what you really wanted, baby?
Now that you're gone
I feel like myself again
Grieving the things I can’t repair and willing
To let you blame it on me
And set your guilt free
I don’t want to hold you back now, love
I can’t change who I am
Not this time, I won’t lie to keep you near me
And in this short life
There’s no time to waste on giving up
My love wasn’t enough
And you can blame it on me
And set your guilt free
I don’t want to hold you back now, love2Embed
