If I Only Had A Heart Lyrics
I'd give my heart
If you'd give your attention
But when I look
There's just an open trench, and baby

I can't stand to see you, girl
Showing off your silver party dress
No, you can't come over now
The house ain't neat
My room's a mess

I'd give my heart
To just be in contention
But I sold it off
At the baseball card convention

I can't stand to see you, girl
Rubbing motor oil on all your joints
No, I ain't no straight-A wiz
But I could learn
That's not the point (I'll plot my points)
I'd give my heart
If I had one for giving
I'd give my heart
Your lips could keep me living

I'd give my heart (I'd give my heart)
And always be forgiving
I'd give my heart (I'd give my heart)
If I had one for givingEmbed
