Ups And Downs Lyrics
I've been cheating on you ever since we broke up
I've been dreaming about you ever since I woke up
Now my hearing's disappearing ever since you spoke up

So I'll devise a plot to break your heart
Think up a plan that I'll never carry out
What's wrong with you?
Tell me now
What should I do?

Don't let me down
I couldn't take much more of your love
Don't let me down
I couldn't take much more of you love

So i asked you to the show but I knew you'd never show up
You came to my birthday party just to tell me I should grow up
And then I see another girl and I think I'm gonna throw up!

So I'll devise a plan to make you mad
Dirty tricks to come back and take command
I'll win your hand
We'll hijack a plane and we're never gonna land
Don't let me down
I couldn't take much more of your love
Don't let me down
I couldn't take much more of your love

Don't let me down
I couldn't take much more of your love
Don't call me up
I'm so sick and tired of being down
Don't let me down
I'm so sick and tired of hanging up
Don't call me up
I couldn't take much more of your loveEmbed
