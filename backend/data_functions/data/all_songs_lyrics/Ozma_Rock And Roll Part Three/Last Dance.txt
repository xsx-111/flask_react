Last Dance LyricsSay hello to your last chance
Same as your first chance
A kinder reminder from Ozma
Say hello to the new sound
Same as the old sound
So spin it, get in it, and stay
I knew that the night had an end soon in sight
Until you called my name
Say hello when you've spied her
Sitting on the dryer
It's spinning, ninth inning, so play
Say hello like a spider
Weave a web right beside her
Spin it, get in it, and prey
I knew that the night had an end soon in sight
Until you called my name
I knew all along I was right but I'm wrong
Somehow you knew my name
After the last dance, you lose your last chance
After the last dance, you lose your last chance
After the last dance, you lose your last chance
After the last dance, you lose your last chance
You lose your last chance
You lose your last chance
You lose your last chance
You've lost your last chanceEmbed
