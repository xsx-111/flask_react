Shooting Stars Lyrics
I finally feel at ease
I'm on an eastern breeze
It blows me to the shore
Come back to kiss my dear
Come back to face my fears
It can't be worse than war

Unless you say that you gave your heart away (gave your heart away)
Unless you say that I shouldn't have returned (shouldn't have returned)
And in that case, I'll go

Every night I see a shooting star
And wonder if it's landing where you are
If you can see it then you can't be far
And if that's the way you do it
That's the way you find your love

The air is cold and thin
I'm on my second wind
It blows me to your door
Lean into the bell and press
You're in a brand new dress
I've never seen before

But then you say that you gave your heart away (gave your heart away)
And then you say that I shouldn't have returned (shouldn't have returned)
So I turn my face, and go

Every time I take a look around
I find myself looking down
To a place that's looking much more round
I find myself looking down

Every night I see a shooting star
And wonder if it's landing where you are
If you can see it then you can't be far
And if that's the way you do it
That's the way you find your love1Embed
