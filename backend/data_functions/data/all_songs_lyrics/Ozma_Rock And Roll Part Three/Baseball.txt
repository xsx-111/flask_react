Baseball Lyrics

When I feel the morning grass
I let down my guard
Because love comes from the dirt
In my own backyard

Everytime I think I've finished being young
I catch myself having fun
But the moment passes as the sun moves on
So I turn myself back to you


On a diamond in the rough
I spent my better years
And I still see her in the crowd
With diamonds in her ears
And it's depressing that
I can't forget the tune the organist played
La da da da da da da, la da da da da

Everytime I think I've finished being young
I catch myself having fun
But the moment passes as the sun moves on
So I turn myself back to you
Is our season over?
No four leaf clover
I feel it getting colder
Now that it's late fall
Can you still remember?
April to November
You and I were members:
The best team in baseball

So we play our games
I've got a girlfriend
You've found a new guy
But it's not the same
And so I drive
Straight up I-5
To let you know I'm still alive


Everytime I think I've finished being young
I catch myself having fun
But the moment passes as the sun moves on
So I turn myself back to you
Is our season over?
No four leaf clover
I feel it getting colder
Now that it's late fall
Can you still remember?
April to November
You and I were members:
The best team in baseball
