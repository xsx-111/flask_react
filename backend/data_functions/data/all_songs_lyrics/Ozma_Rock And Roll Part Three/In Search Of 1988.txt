In Search Of 1988 Lyrics
Every time I start to remember
I remember I don't want to remember
Warp me back at eighty-eight if only for one day

Turn on Mario and Luigi
Let's sit down put our hands on the Ouija
When it spells out Roisin's name I'll swear it wasn't me

1988 take me back to 1987
I'm in search of days
When times were good and Earth a place in heaven

Now that I jump as high as Luigi
Set me down put my hands on the Ouija
When it spells out your sweet name you'll know that it was me

1988 take me back to 1987
I'm in search of days
When times were good and Earth a place in heaven

Take me back to 1987
Times were good and Earth a place in heaven
I want to make a motion to stop the commotion
I second the motion to stop the commotion
I've got another notion, it's a backwards motion
I've got a notion, back-back-back backwards motion
Oh, yeah

1988 take me back to 1987
I'm in search of days
When times were good and Earth a place in heaven

Take me back to 1987
Times were good and Earth a place in heavenEmbed
