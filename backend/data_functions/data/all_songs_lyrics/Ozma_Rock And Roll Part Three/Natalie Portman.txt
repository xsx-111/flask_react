Natalie Portman Lyrics
I'm telling you a story now
Of something that's wrong
This has been developing
Since 1981

Maybe she's alone
Maybe she's alone
What can I do?
What can I do?

There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing I can do

If I'm a proper Jewish boy
Will her family love me?
Can't stand to see her on the big stage
And know she's not thinking of me
Maybe she's alone
Maybe she's alone
What can I do?
What can I do?

There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing I can do

Maybe she'll be hearing this
But probably she won't
Possibly she has desires
But probably she don't

Maybe she's alone
Maybe she's alone
What can I do?
What can I do?
There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing
Nothing
There's nothing
I can do, yeah

Maybe she's alone
Maybe she's alone
What can I do?
What can I do?
What can I do?
What can I do?

There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing I can do
There's nothing
There's nothing
There's nothing I can doEmbed
