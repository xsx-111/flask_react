Battlescars Lyrics
Of all the shooting stars I knew
I never felt at ease with anyone but you
Don't ever wonder where I go
Remember that the grass still grows beneath the snow

When everything around turns blue
Just fall asleep and wake when it's all through

There's battle scars on all my guitars
But still I come out here and play

And now I've lost your touch again
I know I'm only one in twenty thousand men
I promise not to let you go
Just close your eyes and sleep right through the falling snow

When I finally wash ashore
I'm coming back to kiss the girl I kissed before
Of all the shooting stars I knew
I never fell for anyone but you
There's battle scars on all my guitars
But I still come out here and play
There's battle scars on my face and my arms
But you still kiss me everyday
There's battle scars on all my guitars
But I still come out everyday
There's battle scars on my face and my arms
But you still kiss me anyway

There's battle scars on all my guitars
But I still come out here and play
There's battle scars on my face and my arms
But you still kiss me everyday
There's battle scars on all my guitars
But I still come out anyway
There's battle scars on my face and my arms
But you still kiss me anyway
