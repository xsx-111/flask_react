Domino Effect Lyrics
Chances last a finite time
In the warm July night time
Every care that keeps you from your feet
Is a care that carries your defeat

You better let 'er rip tonight
With a pocket full of kryptonite
Every care that keeps you in your seat
Is a care that carries your defeat

Sing that song you sang long ago
A heartbeat so sure and slow
Hold me and don't let go
The fourteenth domino

Twenty thousand points of light
Sun by day disco ball by night
Every care that keeps you from the beat
Is a care that carries your defeat

Sing that song that i used to know
The fourteenth black domino
Hold me like long ago
A heartbeat sure and slow
Chances last a finite time
In the warm July nighttime
Every care that keeps you from your feet
Is a care that carries your defeat

Chances last a finite time, and you're running out of time1Embed
