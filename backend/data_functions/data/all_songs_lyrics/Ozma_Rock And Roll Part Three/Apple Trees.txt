Apple Trees Lyrics
Deep inside my eye, there is part of you
You still look the same, except you're grown up now
So much time has passed
Since I saw you last, oh whoa

An apple pie, the number pi
I studied you in math class, oh
And did all my work but never got your digits

Take a number like 5, times 10, times 10 again
500 miles of apple orchards to defend

Deep inside my core, there is part of you
You still look the same, except you're upside down
And why are you still in my eye?
Will your memory ever die? Oh whoa

An apple tree, a family tree
We'll plant ours together, oh
The roots will hold forever and forever
So what can I say? I won't delay, I'm leaving today
500 miles of apple orchards in my way


A macintosh, a macintosh
You messaged me all winter, oh
And I wrote replies but still felt like a loser

Pack an apple to eat, go hit the street
And get on your feet
500 miles of apple orchards 'til we meet

So I'm taking a stand with apple in hand
I'll pull up my sleeve
It's time that I make like an apple tree and leave1Embed
