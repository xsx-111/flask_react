Rocks Lyrics
I've been looking for a way to find a way to find you
Turning over every unturned stone
I thought everyone was flipped but I guess Eagle Rock got skipped
'Cause that's where you've been all along alone

Whoa, oh-woah oh-woah oh-oh
Whoa, oh-woah oh-woah oh-oh

I've been tryin' to find a way to finally up and find you
Climbing every boulder in my way
To throw me off your trail you moved to Boulder, Colorado
A hop, a skip, and one long jump away

Whoa, oh-woah oh-woah oh-oh
Whoa, oh-woah oh-woah oh-oh

I finally found a way to find a way to finally find you
Down where Colorado Street meets Hill
Pick a rock and throw it way across the Rocky Mountains
And pray to God it hits your window sill
I will never skip a rock (I will never skip a rock)
I will never skip a rock again
I will never skip a rock (I will never skip a rock)
I will never skip a rock againEmbed
