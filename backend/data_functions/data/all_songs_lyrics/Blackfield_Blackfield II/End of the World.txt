End of the World LyricsDon't you forget what I've told you
For so many years:
We are hopeless and slaves to our fears
We're an accident called human beings
Don't be angry for loving me, baby
Or say it's unreal
So many lies turn to songs
Like roses who hide in their thorns
It's the end of the world
The end of the world
It's a prison for dreams and for hopes
Yet still we believe there is God
It's the end of the world
The end of the world
We're dead though pretend we're alive
Full of ignorance, fools in disguise
In your room doing nothing but staring
At flickering screens
Streets are empty
But still you can hear
Joy of children turning to tears
Disease hides around every corner
Quietly still
Wait for the moment to heal
Wait for God, want his touch, want to feel
It's the end of the world
The end of the world
It's a prison for dreams and for hopes
Yet still we believe there is God
It's the end of the world
The end of the world
We're dead though pretend we're alive
Full of ignorance, fools in disguise
Take this pill it will make you feel dizzy
And then give you wings
Soon boy you're falling to sleep
Without nightmares, without any fears
If you wake up in hell or in heaven
Tell the angels we're here
Waiting below for a dream
Here in the garden of sin
It's the end of the world
The end of the world
It's a prison for dreams and for hopes
Yet still we believe there is God
It's the end of the world
The end of the world
We're dead but pretend we're alive
Full of ignorance, fools in disguiseEmbed
