My Gift of Silence LyricsIf I compiled
all my crimes and my lies
into amnesty,
would you come back to me?
The smile on my lips
is a sign
that I don't hear you leaving me,
and I don't hear my own soul scream.
I'll read your lips,
watch your scarf play at your hips,
and I know it's true,
but I don't hear and call to you:
"Don't blame yourself,
don't change yourself,
just want to be over you see and feel numb.
Don't hate yourself."
If I compiled
all my crimes and my lies
into amnesty,
would you come back to me?
The smile on my lips
is a sign
that I don't hear you leaving me,
and I don't hear my own soul scream.
Don't blame yourself, (don't blame yourself)
don't change yourself, (don't change yourself)
just want to be over you see and feel numb. (don't hate yourself)
Don't hate yourself.Embed
