This Killer LyricsDon't leave the door ajar
Don't walk away
Don't leave me in the dark
You think you know me well
It makes me laugh
Cause I don't know myself
This killer on the run
He steals from me the sun
He'll catch me off my guard
He likes me when I'm down and when I'm sad
Falling man
Falling man
It's always me alone
That hears the noise
'Cause it's my inner voice
So stay inside your home
And hide away
Before I lose control
This killer on the run
He steals from me the sun
He'll catch me off my guard
He likes me when I'm down and when I'm sad
Falling man
Falling man
This killer on the run
He steals from me the sun
And I can say I know him well
And so can he because it's me
He is me
He is meEmbed
