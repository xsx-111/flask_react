Once LyricsWant you to know
That I could go
Anytime
I want you to know
Gave me her lips
Gave me her perfect hips
And I slow down
I slow down in love
Once I rise inside
Once she would hold me
She was my only
Only true love
Once she had told me
That I'm holy
Only so long
She'll stay all night
She'll be so quiet
And she won't
Laugh at my jokes
Once I rise inside
Once she would hold me
She was my only
Only true love
Once she had told me
That I'm holy
Only so long
Once she would hold me
She was my only
Only true love
Once she had told me
That I'm holy
Only so longEmbed
