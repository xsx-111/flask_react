Some Day LyricsWhen you were a boy,
you had no place inside your parents' world.
You were falling like the leaves
from an old and dying tree
You went to school,
but the teachers made you feel a fool.
While the children played with joy,
you're the one they would avoid.
Some day,
you will find a better place to stay.
You'll never need to feel this way again, again, again.
Show your smile.
They'd like to have you in their members' club.
They'll buy you drinks and tell you lies,
paper umbrella with some ice.
No one cares
about that fucking pretty face you have.
It means nothing much this life,
so find the highest cliff and dive.
Some day,
you will find a better place to stay.
You'll never need to feel this way again, again, again.
Some day,
you will find a better place to stay.
You'll never need to feel this way again, again, again.Embed
