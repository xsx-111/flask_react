Magnet Lyrics
We were living inside but the winter followed me
Formed a pattern from a single line
Now I'm repeating everything

If this is what we all were waiting for
To trace it back to places we have known
And after thirteen years it was ignored
So we forgot what it was like to be alone

We were sleeping inside your house for several weeks
On the mattress side by side though we would never speak

If this is what we all were waiting for
To trace it back to places we have known
And after thirteen years it was ignored
So we forgot what it was like to be alone

Can you still feel the pull, can you?
Can you still feel the pull, can you?
Can you still feel the pull, can you?
Can you still feel the pull, can you?
Can you still feel the pull, can you?
Can you still feel the pull, can you?Embed
