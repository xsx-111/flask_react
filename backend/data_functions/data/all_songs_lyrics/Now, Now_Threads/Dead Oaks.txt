Dead Oaks Lyrics
I can't feel your bones, but I can see them
And I can't call you up without a reason
I can take a thousand miles
And I can drive for hours
To your house in the summer
But I could stay for longer
If you wanted me to

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I've been up
And, oh-oh, I don't sleep enough
And, oh-oh, I know we don't talk as much
But I can hear you still
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I've been up
And, oh-oh, I don't sleep enough
And, oh-oh, I know we don't talk as much
But I can hear you still
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I've been up
And, oh-oh, I don't sleep enough
And, oh-oh, I know we don't talk as much

But I can hear your voice on the phone
When you're up all alone
In your room
'Cause I am up too1Embed
