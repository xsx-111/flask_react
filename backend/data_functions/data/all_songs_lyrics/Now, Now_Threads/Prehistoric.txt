Prehistoric LyricsI know this will mess things up tonight
But god, it feels so good to close my eyes
I'll say that I've been trying to move on
We both know I'm not
It may be different now, but the pattern won't wash out
Covers up our eyes, leaves us knots and severed ties
We follow new lines
I would trade this sleep for you in a heartbeat
But this weather will not lift
It leaves us shouting into cliffs without an echo
Each day you come closer
So close I can almost feel your breath on my shoulders
But I know if I turn around you might run away again
It may be different now, but the pattern won't wash out
Covers up our eyes, leaves us knots and severed ties
We follow new lines
Stuck like those prehistoric mammoths in the ice
Thaw me out and I won't close my eyes
Stuck like those prehistoric mammoths in the ice
Thaw me out and I won't go to sleep tonight1Embed
