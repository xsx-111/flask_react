Thread Lyrics
Find a thread to pull
And we can watch it unravel
'Cause we've been living with
A ghost of summer from two years ago

A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us

A needle dragging thread
To form the chapters only we could know
But they will overlap
And cast a shadow on what little is left

A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us

Find a thread to pull
And we can watch it unravel
But this is just the start
We'll find out who we are
A hint of light in the dark
Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between usEmbed
