Separate Rooms Lyrics
We both cried on that night
You took the car, left us behind

But you don't mind, so I don't mind
But you don't mind, so I don't mind

When you came home we slept downstairs
In separate rooms; we left you there
And you would hang around for them
But you could not just wait for me

But you don't mind, so I don't mind
But you don't mind, and I don't mind

I'll stay right here and carry you
While you clear your head and I grind my teeth
And I'll work on the floor, I'll wash it so good
Maybe then we can talk like we did before1Embed
