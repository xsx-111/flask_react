School Friends LyricsYou have a girlfriend but she's not your girlfriend
She's just your friend for the night
You'll have a new one in the morning
She'll have really pretty eyes
She'll be invisible like you want her
She'll try to do everything just right for you
You have a girlfriend but she's not your girlfriend
You just like her where she's at
And you'll thank her for the things she bought you
Then you'll go on your way
She'll be invisible like you want her
She won't go to class, but she'll sleep in your bed
And the next day when you chase the other girl
She'll remember all the things you said to her4Embed
