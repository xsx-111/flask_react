The Pull Lyrics
Find a thread to pull and we can watch it unravel
The lines we both have sewn to form the fabric of a fragile home
We'll spend a month apart
At least I know when you'll be coming home
But this is just the start
We'll find out who we are
A hint of light in the dark
But only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between usEmbed
