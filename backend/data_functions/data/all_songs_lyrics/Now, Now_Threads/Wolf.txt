Wolf Lyrics
I would kill to be
Your clothes
Cling to your body
And hang from your bones

But I could make a mark
If you would let me start

You've been feeling smaller
Take a different number
Like you do, like you do
When you talk about it
You don't want to hear it
Tell me more, tell it all, can you take it?

I would kill to be
The cold
Tracing your body
And shaking your bones

But I-I-I-I, I-I-I
Ca-a-a-a, a-an't
Sle-e-e-e, e-eep
At ni-i-i-i-i-i-ight
I-I-I-I, I-I-I
Ca-a-a-a, a-an't
Sle-e-e-e, e-eep
At ni-i-i-i-i-i-ight
You've been feeling smaller
Take a different number
Like you do, like you do
When you talk about it
You don't want to hear it
Tell me more, tell it all, can you take it?
You've been feeling smaller
Take a different number
Like you do, like you do
When you talk about it
You don't want to hear it
Tell me more, tell it all, can you take it?

I can find the things
That I have left behind tonight
If I try
If I try
I could find the things
That I have left behind tonight
If I tried
If I tried

You've been feeling smaller
Take a different number
Like you do, like you do
When you talk about it
You don't want to hear it
Tell me more, tell it all, can you take it?
You've been feeling smaller
Take a different number
Like you do, like you do
When you talk about it
Don't want to hear about it
Tell me more, tell it all, can you take it?2Embed
