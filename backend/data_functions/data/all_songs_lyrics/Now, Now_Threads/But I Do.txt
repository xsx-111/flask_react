But I Do Lyrics
We can keep in touch if that's what you want
You can call me, too, if that's what friends do
It's not more than one, if that's what you thought
You'd say I don't have much room for you
But I do

I could stay inside if that's what you want
I won't say a word for a day or two
When I'm in my room, I know what to do about you

I can sleep
I can sleep
I can sleep soon

When I get home I am kept from everyone in the house
I'll walk down the hall where you have gone
To feel the way it felt again, again
Again, again

I am what you need when you can't find it somewhere else
I am what you want when you don't have anything else

I am what you need when you can't find it somewhere else
I am what you want when you don't have anything else1Embed
