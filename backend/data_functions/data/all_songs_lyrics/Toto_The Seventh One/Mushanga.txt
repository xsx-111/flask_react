Mushanga Lyrics
I can't forget you my little Mushanga
I keep a place in my heart for you
The days of waiting they keep getting longer
And not a thing I can do
I was a poet, a magazine writer
Sent to report on political views
It was by chance through a lens that I met you
A Cape Town girl with no shoes

You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lent you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you
Mushanga oh, Mushanga oh
I sat and watched as she danced by the fires
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains
The loss of lives mining white man's gold
I had to leave and go back to Manhattan
Where all my stories are bought and sold
I know the city would surely be saddened
If what I knew could be told

You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lend you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you
Mushanga oh, Mushanga oh
It's been so long since I last heard your laughter
So many letters and still no news
I hope you find all the things that you're after
You know my heart is with you

You were runnin' down the road
I was going your way
I stopped and turned around to lend you my hand
You smiled though you were suffering
I didn't understand, then

You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
You broke into my heart
Like the wind and rain that followed you
You broke into my heart
Had the Lord above forgotten you?
You broke into my heart
I saw your eyes and then I knew
Woa oh oh oh oh woa
Woa oh oh woa
Woa oh oh oh oh woa
You broke in from the start
And all my tears belong to you
Mushanga oh, Mushanga oh
Mushanga oh, Mushanga oh
Mushanga oh, Mushanga oh
Mushanga oh, Mushanga ohEmbed
