A Thousand Years Lyrics
Day after day
I feel myself slowing down
What does it mean?
The air has changed
It's getting harder to breathe
Or so it would seem

Sail me away to a distant shore
Where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin', the world will come tumbling down
In a thousand years

Tell me, my friend
Can you imagine a place
Free of boundaries and lies?
There's blood on the wind
And it's come all of the way
From faraway skies
Take me away to a different world, where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin', the world will come tumbling down
In a thousand years
A thousand years
One day for every life
Just keep on going, we'll find you a home underground
In a thousand years


Sail me away to a distant shore, where everything's fine

A thousand years
Lost in the blink of an eye
If the sky keeps fallin', the world will come tumblin' down
In a thousand years
A thousand years
One day for every life
Just keep on going, we'll find you a home underground
In a thousand years
Sail me away to a distant shore, where everything's fine...Embed
