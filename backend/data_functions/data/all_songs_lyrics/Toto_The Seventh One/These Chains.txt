These Chains Lyrics
Everybody keeps talkin' about you
I can't lie anymore
Been too long, what went wrong?
It's a mystery
Why you ever walked out that door

What direction should I go?
Girl what's next for me?
I don't know

Is it gonna get easier?
Than tryin' to break these chains around my heart
Oh oh
Does it ever get easier?
Without you I can't pull these chains apart
Oh oh

I see your face
When I look in the mirror
I feel your touch but you're not there
Wakin' up -- had enough
Of this dream of mine
Girl this just isn't fair
What direction should I go?
Girl what's next for me?
I don't know

Is it gonna get easier?
Than tryin' to break these chains around my heart
Ohhh ohhh
Does it ever get easier?
Without you I can't pull these chains apart
Oh oh

Day by day
Until they break
Oh oh

Is it gonna get easier?
Than tryin' to break these chains around my heart
Oh oh
Does it ever get easier?
Without you I can't pull these chains apart
Oh ohEmbed
