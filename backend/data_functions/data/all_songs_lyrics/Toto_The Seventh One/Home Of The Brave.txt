Home Of The Brave Lyrics
Everything's gonna be alright boys
Help is on the way
Hold your head up high now
There's no need to cry now
We're not running anymore
Leave the politics behind boys
They're not working anymore
There's so much more at stake here
It's make or break here
Haven't we been here before?
Well come on!

Tell me what we're waiting for

You gotta remember
You don't have to be afraid
You still have the freedom to learn
And say what you wanna say
You gotta remember
Don't let 'em take away
The land we call the home of the brave
Who sings the song of the people?
You don't hear it anymore
I heard it late last summer
To the beat of a different drummer
It never sounded quite like this before
So you're trying to shake this feeling
That trouble's right outside the door
You lie awake each dark night
Like a time bomb wound up too tight
A storm in waiting, just offshore
Well, come on!

Tell me what we're waiting for
3x
You gotta remember
You don't have to be afraid
You still have the freedom to learn
And say what you wanna say
You gotta remember
Don't let 'em take away
The land we call the home of the braveEmbed
