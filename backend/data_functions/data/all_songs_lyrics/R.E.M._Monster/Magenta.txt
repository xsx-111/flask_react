Magenta Lyrics
Music make you lose control
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Da ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Da ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba (Music make you lose control)
Ayy (Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba)
This is that Knock Monsterr (Da ba, ba ba ba ba ba)
Quarantine tape, let's go (Da ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba)
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba

Keep the shit clean (Ayy), wash your hands (Now wash your hands)
Oh my god (Yup), who's your mans? (Ayy)
Lookin' like a Big Bird (Ayy), bitch, he ain’t fly (Nah)
Feel like André said, "I’m alright, alright, alright, alright, alright"
Ayy, Knock got the bars like granola (Yuh)
Me and my squad gonna kill Baby Yoda (Man, fuck that kid)
Punt him ‘cross the field (Goal!), now that’s a sport
He gon’ have to see a doctor, and I ain’t talkin’ rorp (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Stay outta my head
All that shit you said (Whoa)
Stay outta my head
All that shit you said
Got me textin', "LOL," but I ain't laughing, though
You got everything you wanted, are you happy, though?
'Bouta hit them with that sweet shit, cookie dough, make you sick
Damn, why’d you eat so much, though?
Got me textin', "LOL," damn, I might chuckle
Leave a hole in the wall, that’s bloody knuckles
Hangin’ with a rat cat like I'm Arbuckle
All you see is one half like Garfunkel
Ayy, Monsterr's in the name so you best be hidin’ (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Leave a bitch speechless (Ayy, ayy, ayy), call her Joe Biden (Now that's malarkey)
Be runnin’ like Sonic the Hedgehog in a casino (Yuh, ayy)
Eating Oreos, I’m the new Childish Gambino (Feel like Gambino)
All these mediocre boys off the shits, hon
If you have a kid, name him Bart, he’s the simp’s son
Get the shit done, drop another slapper
Might be socially distant, but still an epic rapper

Stay outta my head (Stay out of my head)
All that shit you said (Ayy, all the shit that you said)
Stay outta my head (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
All that shit you said
One more time!

Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Da ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Da ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Da ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Da ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Come on, hand it overEmbed
