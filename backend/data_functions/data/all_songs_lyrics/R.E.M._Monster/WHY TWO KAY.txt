WHY TWO KAY Lyrics
Gon'-gon'-gon' be alright
Gon'-gon'-gon' be alright
Alright
Yuh, whoa

I ain’t been good but I’ll be great soon
Yeah, I wanna be a star, yeah
Wanna break out of the ozone
Wanna make it out on my own
I'm gonna be alright, I'm gonna be alright
Sorry I been actin' wack, I hope you’re doin' alright

Yeah? Okay, Monsterr's on the loose, ain’t nobody escapin’
Sound the alarms like somebody’s been vapin’
I ain’t hatin’, I’m just real frustrated
I ain’t hatin’, shit’s just been real rough lately
Ayy, but I’m sneakin’ through the cracks like a hacker
Don’t fuck with boomers ridin’ 'round in a tractor
I put the shit together like Nina and Alexander
And I got the slime, lookin’ like a salamander
Hangin’ with the mob but I feel like a psycho
Feel like I might go off like a light go
Travel ‘cross time and space just to cope with this shit
Stick to your skull like honey, yeah, I’m down with the drip, ayy
Fuck around, drop a song, I need some hype, yuh
Drown out all the noise, man, I feel like Baby Driver
You’re lookin’ like Wario, tryna chase after the bag
Homie, you ain’t got no style, got other rappers in your tags
Ayy, oh, yuh, oh
Whoa, yuh
Gon'-gon'-gon' be alright
Gon'-gon'-gon' be alright
Be alright
Yuh, whoa

I ain’t been good but I’ll be great soon
Yeah, I wanna be a star, yeah
Wanna break out of the ozone
Wanna make it out on my own
I'm gonna be alright, I'm gonna be alright
Sorry I been actin' wack, I hope you’re doin' alright

Uh-huh
