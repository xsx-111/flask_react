MENTAL CHILLNESS Lyrics
Vibes dude, vibes

Can you fuck with me now? If you can't, don't lie
I be on the scene now, got you so tongue-tied
I be on my way as soon as this shit ends
Soon as I can see you again

Soon as I can see you again
Soon as I can see you again

Can you fuck with me now? If you can't, don't lie
I be on the scene now, got you so tongue-tied
I be on my way as soon as this shit ends
Soon as I can see you again
Can you fuck with me now? If you can't, don't lie
I be on the scene now, got you so tongue-tied
I be on my way as soon as this shit ends
Soon as I can see you again

Yeah
Riding with my people
They love me 'cause I'm perfect and they hate me 'cause I'm evil
Yeah, they're waitin' on the sequel
Gotta get it right in like a freethrow
Did you do it 'cause you love or it or just do it for the clout?
Or did you do it just to hear your own words come out your mouth?
Can you fuck with me now? If you can't, don't lie
I be on the scene now, got you so tongue-tied
I be on my way as soon as this shit ends
Soon as I can see you again
Can you fuck with me now? If you can't, don't lie
I be on the scene now, got you so tongue-tied
I be on my way as soon as this shit ends
Soon as I can see you again

Ayy, what it do?
I pity the fool, I hit up your boo
Funny face and fucked up teeth too
Man how the fuck I have more game than you?
Legend status, only thing I desire
I am the Hyperpop Tobey Maguire
Coppinâ€™ Hot Topic for your alt bitch on the way
If it makes you upset, that's gon' be the fit todayEmbed
