PUNK BABY Lyrics
Everybody love to talk
Everybody love to talk and talk
Everybody love to talk
Everybody love to talk, yuh

W-w-why you shoutin’, boy? You know I can hear ya
This don’t look right, like I’m lookin’ in the mirror
They don’t know me, they just hangin’ with The Boy
They won’t know me 'cause they hangin’ with The Boy

Hop up, hop up on the block with a Jimmy Neutron cranium
New style, clowns tryna steal it, kleptomania
Tryna play me, huh? Well, you’re holding your controller wrong
Shoutout to my homeboys H-Bomb and Donkey Kong
'Cause I’m a wacky creature, hanging with my crew
Me and my squad, call it Monsterr’s Inc. 2
Big Man listened to my tracks, said, “This ain’t you”
Well, you ain’t even 'round, you don’t even know me, dude
Look, I’m just statin' facts, water’s wet, grass is green
Autism is flat and the Earth is vaccines
And I like to be nice, no, I don’t like to be mean
But if you’re a fucking creep then I really do not like you, man
Oh, no
Yeah, I’ve seen those texts, that’s nasty, someone shoulda taught you manners
Oh, no
Told you once I ain’t yo man, tell you once ihavetheplan
W-w-why you shoutin’, boy? You know I can hear ya
This don’t look right, like I’m lookin’ in the mirror
They don’t know me, they just hangin’ with The Boy
They won’t know me 'cause they hangin’ with The Boy
Why you shoutin’, boy? You know I can hear ya
Flow is sick, so I best shouldn’t be near ya
You don’t know me, you’re just hangin’ with The Boy
You can’t know me 'cause you’re hangin’ with The Boy
(Break-break-break-break)

Breakdown, hit the breakdown, break it down
Breakdown, hit the breakdown, break it down
Breakdown, hit the breakdown, break it down
Boy, it’s 2 AM, why you tryna break down?
Look, sometimes you just gotta
It’s best to be respectful
I just need to get some water
What you tryna be a dick for?
Yuh
Breakdown-down-down, break-breakdown-down
Break-break-breakdown-down, breakdown-down-down
Break-breakdown-down, break-break-breakdown-down
Hit the, hit the, hit the break-break-break-break-break-break-break-break—breakdown
Hit the, hit the, hit the, hi-hit the, hit the, hi-hi-hi-hit
Why you shoutin’, boy? You know I can hear ya
This don’t look right, like I’m lookin’ in the mirror
They don’t know me, they just hangin’ with The Boy
They won’t know me 'cause they hangin’ with The Boy-Boy
Why you shoutin’, boy? You know I can hear ya
Flow is sick, so I best shouldn’t be near ya
You don’t know me, you’re just hangin’ with The Boy
You can’t know me 'cause you’re hangin’ with The Boy

Everybody love to talk
Everybody
Everybody love to talk
Everybody
YuhEmbed
