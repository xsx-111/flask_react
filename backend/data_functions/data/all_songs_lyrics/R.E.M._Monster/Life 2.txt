Life 2 Lyrics
It was the last thing I saw before I slipped into the night
That sad little reflection, sleep was hanging off its eyes
And I don't want your promises, think I'm runnin' out of options
And I don't wanna need you
No, I don't wanna need you

So I sneak off to the clothes shop, makin' my way
Comin' back empty-handed every other day
Think it's next to a GameStop, went there a few times
And the walk ain't pretty but it gets me outside
Tryna become, I don't think I can afford to
Watch out for the zombie boy walkin' towards you
My closet door's busted open, please don't look inside
I can guarantee you won't like what you find

Vision’s getting blurry, I don’t know why
And I wanna feel better, God knows I tried
I can never find the answers, all of the time
And I’d like to say that I got nothin' to hide
Maybe it’s my fault, expectations too high
Pullin’ weeds out the garden, clearin’ my mind
But they keep spreadin’ and I keep switching sides
Maybe I just gotta keep it outta sight
Devil keep his hands on me, cover my eyes, I can't see
What you tryna be? What you tryna be?
Demons keep their hands on me, cover my eyes, I can't see
What you tryna be? What you tryna be?
What you tryna be? What you tryna be?
Yo, fuck this sad shit, am I right?
Yeah, fuck it
Fuck it! We're done with it

So I sneak off to the clothes shop, makin' my way
Comin' back empty-handed every other day
Think it's next to a GameStop, went there a few times
And the walk ain't pretty but it gets me outside
Tryna become, I don't think I can afford to
Watch out for the zombie boy walkin' towards you
My closet door's busted open, please don't look inside
I can guarantee you won't like what you findEmbed
