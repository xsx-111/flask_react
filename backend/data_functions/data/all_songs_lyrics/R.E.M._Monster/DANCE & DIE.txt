DANCE & DIE Lyrics

KM, hop into the building on that gamer business
CEO mindset couldn't cure my mental illness
Ugly and dissociating, man, I feel like Salad Fingers
Hop out of the pool, mutate and kill these horny bitches
This is the place I wanna be, like Jack Black at Freddy's
I be making classics like a Redditor make JoJo reference
Had to leave your girl on read 'cause she don't vibe to gecs and
I'm just tryna dance and die like I'm Michael Jackson

Like I'm Michael Jackson
Like I'm Michael Jackson
Like I'm Michael Jackson
Like Michael Jackâ€”

Kylo Ren looking bitch boy
That is not a compliment, bitch boy
Hunt you down by your stench, bitch boy
Mountain Dew code red type, bitch boy
Ayy, bet 2015 was your peak
Just take the fucking L, it's real like Luigi leak
Mentally deranged, but my look's still sleek
Told you I make noise, bitch, I do not speak
I'm just tryna dance and die


Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Put me in my place, take me to your place, tired every
Tired every, tired every day

I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're here
I'm really glad you're hereEmbed
