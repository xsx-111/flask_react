PRIDE Lyrics
Yuh
Yuh

I’m a crazy fuckin’ creature, can you keep me by your side?
Be my ride or die, imagining you with me in the moonlight
Summertime always made me scared, now I know why
Used to tell me that boys don’t cry
Fuck, I'ma shed a tear for the hell of it
I ain’t here to argue, I’m here to celebrate
I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna hide, yuh
I’m a crazy fuckin’ creature, can you keep me by your side?
Be my ride or die, imagining you with me in the moonlight
Summertime always made me scared, now I know why
Used to tell me that boys don’t cry
Fuck, I'ma shed a tear for the hell of it
I ain’t here to argue, I’m here to celebrate
I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna hide

I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free (Yeah)
Playin' dress up, stay out of eyesight
In all my lonely days, you were the highlight
No crowd would’ve made a difference, always in my feelings
I’m workin' on healing
Yuh
Guess I’m just runnin' from the dogs like a little kid
Just scared of the dark like a little kid
Guess I’m just runnin' from the dogs like a little kid
Just scared of the dark like a little kid

I’m a crazy fuckin’ creature, can you keep me by your side?
Be my ride or die, imagining you with me in the moonlight
Summertime always made me scared, now I know why
Used to tell me that boys don’t cry
Fuck, I'ma shed a tear for the hell of it
I ain’t here to argue, I’m here to celebrate
I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna hide, yuh
I’m a crazy fuckin’ creature, can you keep me by your side?
Be my ride or die, imagining you with me in the moonlight
Summertime always made me scared, now I know why
Used to tell me that boys don’t cry
Fuck, I'ma shed a tear for the hell of it
I ain’t here to argue, I’m here to celebrate
I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna hide, I don’t wanna hide
