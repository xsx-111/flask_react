A Song About Fishing Lyrics
The mud in my fingers had dried to a crust
Sleep in my eyes, I pick my rust
My boots have been ravaged in browns and grays, I've
Seen no scale and I've, seen no pay, but
Still I trudge to a spotless stream
Not a bird in the sky or a fish in the sea
To dwell in these waters is a foolish way
To believe one night, that I'll win the day

And rise and shine, to dawn I wake
To cast my net in a fishless lake
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake
Casting my net in a fishless lake

Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
I sailed downstream to see what had, I
Pulled my boat along the land, I
Swam the dirt, and walked the stream and
Off the shore, I saw a bream and
Tuna too, and salmon roe
Do my eyes deceive, but my net had broke
I told my tale to a merchant man
He pitied me a dollar, and gave me his hand, he said

Rise and shine, to dawn I wake
To cast my net in a fishless lake
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake
Casting my net in a fishless lake

Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Each day like a retake
Fisherman inside a sweepstake
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake
To cast my net in a fishless lake
Rise and shine, to dawn I wake
Casting my net in a fishless lake2Embed
