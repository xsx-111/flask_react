Bye Bye LyricsI closed my eyes to disease
Convinced myself that I don't mind
A rolling stone of hidden pleas balled into a landmine
How do I breathe with my hands on my own throat?
How do I cry a stream then drown when I know that I see a boat?
How do I end up sinking inside the warmth of all this praise?
How do I crash inside the steel when I was piloting the plane?
How do I glide with angel wings that's burning all up in the flames?
How do I never take a loss if all I'm playing is a game?
How do I throw myself in water, I never knew how to swim?
How do I ever cast a judgment when I'm seeping in the sin?
I closed my eyes to disease
Convinced myself I don't mind
A rolling stone of hidden pleas balled into a landmine
I saw a picture long ago
The smile has turned to rust
Told myself I won't explode with a molotov in my cup
Bye bye, crawling back to you
Bye bye, crawling back to you
Bye bye, crawling back to you
Bye bye, crawling back to you
Bye bye, crawling back to you
Bye bye, crawling back to you
Bye bye, crawling back to you
Bye bye, crawling back to you
Awake, my baby
Awake, my baby
Awake, my baby
Awake, my baby
Am I a shell of what I was?
Staring in the drought of a sinner's cup
Lapping up my blood like it tastes of love
Am I a shell of what I left?
A saint forever marked by the devil's crest
Hands around my throat praying for a breath
Oh, neck, neck, neck, neck, neck
Do I deserve what is next?
Never observed from the deck
But from gallows
Hardly swimming, only sinking in the void
Saw your smiling teeth but they were only fangs to destroy
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
In the dirt I can see
I am built on what I bleed
Thereâ€™s a blade I can't sheathe
Slice my chest with the ease
I'm immersed in this sea
Is this your fur or is it me?
Black dog!
