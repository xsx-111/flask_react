No Looking Back Lyrics
And everywhere that I go, all the scars on my skin
I tell myself that, there's no looking back
I lost the light in those years, locked myself in those tears
And I know that there's no looking back
And everywhere that I go, all the scars on my skin
I tell myself that, there's no looking back
I lost the light in those years, locked myself in those tears
And I know that there's no looking back

I would question my grounding
And gates up above
Now I finally see myself when I try thinking of love
I can't drown in my blеssings
Or float on my pride
No more waiting for this freedom, it's already been minе

And everywhere that I go, all the scars on my skin
I tell myself that, there's no looking back
I lost the light in those years, locked myself in those tears
And I know that there's no looking back
And everywhere that I go, all the scars on my skin
I tell myself that, there's no looking back
I lost the light in those years, locked myself in those tears
And I know that there's no looking back
There's no looking back
I had the shackles tightly
My soul was wiley
And I always wondered if sun would find me
I would stumble blindly, through all these tears, oh
Till I recognized I'm stronger than my fears, oh

I cleared the water
I cleared the water
I cleared the water
And there's no looking back
I cleared the water
I cleared the water
I cleared the water
And there's no looking back2Embed
