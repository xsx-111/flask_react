Easy Lyrics
He's such a fool
He’s such a fool
If he says that he's in love
He's such a fool
He’s such a fool
If he says that he's in love
She's such a fool
She's such a fool
When she says that she's in love
She's such a fool
She's such a fool
When she says that she's in love

See here is a man who really loves this land, he built his clan up
And here is a land who say she love this man, she swear she catch up
But she say later, later, alligator
Satan lives inside her lap
But she be content with his grab
He’s dateable
Where her soul lies is debatable
Serving hate on silver platables
He’s known to play with bulls
He's too forgiving if love is attainable, ay ay
She’s seen the turn of the tide
Label her poison as pride
Tell me she lied
Saying she care 'bout your life
Smirking at your genocide, ah!
He's such a fool
He's such a fool
If he says that he’s in love
He's such a fool
He's such a fool
If he says that he's in love
She's such a fool
She's such a fool
When she says that she's in love
She's such a fool
She's such a fool

Can we just be?
Can we just be?
Easy

They passed the time
She gave her lies, he gave his life
Paid the price in flashing lights to gain his rights
Contraceptive
Ain't no fucks when there's one deceptive
Yell and scream but she's unreceptive
Ain't no say if they'll gain perspective
She got a new guy with a suit and tie
Blonde hair, blue eyes
Hypnotised
By coloniser advertise
Meant to say
They do not like but he's here to stay
And she cannot keep this man at bay
Waiting on while he invades the day
Can we just be?
Can we just be?
Easy
Can we just be?
Can we just be?
