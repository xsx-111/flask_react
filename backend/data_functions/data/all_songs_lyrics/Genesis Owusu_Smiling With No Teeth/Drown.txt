Drown Lyrics
One, two, three four!

I fix the mask in place
The face of a heathen
I'm joined by stitch
That's the me that you missed
The feeling of the morning
Now that the night is through
I'm feeling kinda blue
Reading through the letters
Befriending all the beggars who would die for you

I took a date with a g 'round the city
God damn, they a bad little kitty
Rob my heart in a manner of a crime spree
Black fur with a face just like me
My other half that I swore I ain't miss
Toxic, hundred percent batshit
Took my hand and started holding me down
Flicked thе crown, and said

You've got to let me drown
You'vе got to let me drown
You've got to let me—
I can't leave till you get it
I can't— (Baby wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
I can't leave till you get it
I can't— (Baby wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
I can't leave till you get it
I can't— (Baby wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
I can't leave till you get it
(Baby wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
I can't leave till you get it

One, two, three, four!

Everybody's laughing
And the jokes on you
All the people that you kissed
It's the me that you missed
When you're mad for the moment
But your footsteps even
Just the leaves that you're raking
Now that summer is through

I look back at the me that I disguised
Rock dropped in the sin, I was baptized
With a devilish grin, I could see the more
It was time for the stage or the curtain call
Chicka chicka, chicka chicka, chicka chicka, yeah
Party's over twin brother, I'm the winner here
Reached out, took my hand started, started holding down
And then I said
You've got to let me drown

I can't leave till you get it
I can't— (Baby wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
I can't leave till you get it
I can't— (Baby wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
I can't leave till you get it
I can't— (Baby wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up)
I can't leave till you get it
I can't leave till you get it

You've got to let me drown
You've got to let me drown
You've got to let me—2Embed
