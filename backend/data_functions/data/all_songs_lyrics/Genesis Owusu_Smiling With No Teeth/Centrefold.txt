Centrefold Lyrics
The black dogs are back with another one
I said the black dogs are back with another one!
Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a
Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a

I can't say I don't lust for you
Turn a fuss for you
I'm a must for you, yeah
I can say I got love for you
But I lied, yeah, hahaha
I can't say that it's just for you
Turn your trust on you
To a rust on you, yeah
I can't say I'll adjust for you
I ain't try

Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a
You my centrefold, yeah
Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco еht ni remmiws a
Take you off your toes, yеah
Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a
You my centrefold, yeah
Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a
Take you off your toes, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back with another one, back with another one
Oh, I just can't get enough
How could you expect me to
You are me, I am you

Yeah, what I want from you
I'ma haunt from you
I'ma seep into your bones
Bae, what I want to do
I'ma flaunt right through
Turn your place into my home
Know this is nothing new
Just enjoy this view
Put my fangs into your dome
I thought you knew this zoo
Don't you fight me boo
I'ma take, I'ma take your soul

Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a
You my centrefold, yeah
Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a
Take you off your toes, yeah
Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a
You my centrefold, yeah
Niap on raef on, niap on raef on, niar yb derehtob t'nsi naeco eht ni remmiws a
Take you off your toes, yeah1Embed
