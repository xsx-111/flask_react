Gold Chains Lyrics
When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains
When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains, yeah

I hope the stress don't kill me
They chip away my heart, expect a coin to fill me
Oh man, my joy so filthy
I pray to some, I'm still me
But boy these demons gleaming, scheming, preaching, leave them
We'll deceive him, he's believing, say we're on his team then
But I've been bleeding, wounds have deepened when I chained my freedom
Reason weakened, beaten, ripping curls like I'm fucking Keenan
They think I'm beaming, I'm the beacon of the young and decent
When I'm in this shell committing treason
You see the truth is that I'm often blue
So many cracks in the ceiling, I tried to mend them with glue
What a profession
Sleep in sessions, curse or blessings, need refreshing
See progression 'cause I beat depression
They throwing pills like M&M's and I'm hoping they don't relapse
On stage, the crowd yelling, don't get lost in feedback
My boo said I should take it slow, wish I could heed that
Without the burning of a fucking greenback

When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains
When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains, yeah
When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains
When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains, yeah
I do this and I do that
On call from sun till moon crack
My phone can never go flat
Who knows where else my work at
I miss this and I miss that
Birthdays, first steps and gift wraps
Hope I don't miss my first dance
Somebody put me in the circus, I'm the world's best juggler
Only two hands, pretend that it don't fuck with my jugular, I'm a new man
While praying that my music will bubble up, this my Truman
Show will rock the boat, I'm still subtler, where's the movement?
I fight for my existence
Brick wall with my persistence
I hate to say I play Russian Roulette with my resistance
Play it void of all assistance
My life, my love, my business
A goon playing charades inside the face of corporate systems
I sanitised organic ties for my arise in modern times
I can't deny internal lies in hopes that I'd be televised
I sacrifice a gentle life for goals that leave me terrified
But pray this doesn't lead to my demise

When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains
When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains, yeah
When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains
When it looks so gold, but it feels so cold inside these chains, yeah
Gold, cold chains
Gold, cold chains
Gold, cold chains
Gold, cold chains1Embed
