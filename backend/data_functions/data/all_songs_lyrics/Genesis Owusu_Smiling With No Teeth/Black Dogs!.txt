Black Dogs! Lyrics
Black dogs!
Something vicious, yeah
Bunch of witches, yeah
Double vision, yeah
Black dogs!
Something vicious, yeah
Bunch of witches, yeah
Double vision, yeah
Black dogs!

On my neck, wear the chain till it rust
Gold teeth, still sitting on the bus
I ain't crack but I'm sitting on the cusp
Dirty look, turn your stare to a punch
Black dogs!
Don't touch that
You, your mans, and your crew ain't allowed back
Dirty Nikes, crinkled tees just to match that
Touch the hair, you get snap like a mousetrap
Black dogs!

Black dogs!
Something vicious, yeah (Something vicious)
Bunch of witches, yeah (Bunch of witches)
Double vision, yeah (Double vision)
Black dogs!
Something vicious, yeah (Something vicious)
Bunch of witches, yeah (Bunch of witches)
Double vision, yeah (Double vision)
Black dogs!
Profiled to the letter
You ain't mean it, man you swear you would never
Let me out, out the chat is a pleasure
Chat, chat, chat, chat, nothing better
No respect till ya knowing who I are
I'm a bum or a motherfucking star
Hey you look like Will Smith from afar
Burnt boy so I guess I reach the bar
Black dogs!

Black dogs!
