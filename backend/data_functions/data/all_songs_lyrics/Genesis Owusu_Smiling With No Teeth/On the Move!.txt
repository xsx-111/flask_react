On the Move! Lyrics
Black
Dogs on the move
Black
Feel the fur on the bruise
Black (Black, black)
Dogs on the move
(Move, move)
Black (Black, black)
Feel the fur on the bruise
(Bruise, bruise)
Black
Dogs on the move

I can feel it in my skin
I can feel my soul move
I can feel all of your sin
I can feel your fangs too
I don't feel the light within
I'm the blackest dog too1Embed
