Smiling with No Teeth Lyrics
Everybody wants the summer without holding the rain
Everybody wants the feeling without touching the pain
Everybody wants the sweetness without tasting the blend
Everybody wants the help but they ain't lending a hand
Yes indeed
Oh, yes indeed

Keep the grammy for you, we need an Oscar
The greatest actors the world has ever seen
Slathering honey on our demons for the palate of the apathetic
Isn't that pathetic?
Our temples are at capacity but we continue to cram in
Body after body
Soul after soul
Opinion aftеr opinion
'Til we don't care
What's really ours

Evеrybody wants the summer without holding the rain
Everybody wants the feeling without touching the pain
Everybody wants the sweetness without tasting the bland
Everybody wants the help but they ain't lending a hand
Yes indeed (everybody, everybody)
Oh, yes indeed (everybody, everybody)
I would never leave you alone baby
Not to say I wouldn't if I could
I've read the story of the two black dogs
Society's stray and the stray's hound
Caressing and stabbing each other with a technician's touch
Too many cries have cried with no tears
Too many nets cast into fishless lakes
Too many smiles cracked with no teeth

Everybody wants the summer without holding the rain (holding the rain)
Everybody wants the feeling without touching the pain (touching the pain)
Everybody wants the sweetness without tasting the bland
Everybody wants the help but they ain't lending a hand
Everybody wants the summer without holding the rain
Everybody wants the feeling without touching the pain
Everybody wants the sweetness without tasting the bland
Everybody wants the help but they ain't lending a hand
Yes indeed, yeah

Smiling with no teeth, yeah
Smiling with no teeth
Smiling with no teethEmbed
