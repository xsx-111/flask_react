Whip Cracker Lyrics
Spit up on your grave
Hope my thoughts behave, we so depraved
Spit up on your grave
Hope my thoughts behave, we so depraved
Hope your soul is safe
We gon' hold your fate
Hope your soul is safe
We gon' hold your fate

Look into the eyes of your master
Tell me if he still got the answer
If he point my ass to the pastor
Better go Casper 'fore a disaster
Why you askin' why I'm so jaded?
Who forgot your thoughts on the races?
Mammy got the crumbs from your faces
Fed all your babies, still copped the racists
You a woman beater, but you still want respect
Fucker bet
Sit your ass in prison, sucker, you get checked
I digress
Goofy motherfucker, slip, and you get slept
Hope you wept
You ain't getting saved, I'm on my Malcolm X
Mama-say, mama-sa, you a fucking star
Keep your hands to yourself when you at the bar
Mama-say, mama-sa, you gon' hold these scars
I don't care 'bout your cars, you be fucking smart

Spit up on your grave
Hope my thoughts behave, we so depraved
Spit up on your grave
Hope my thoughts behave, we so depraved

Mama-say, mama-sa, you a fucking star
Keep your hands to yourself when you at the bar

I been rockin', rockin' with my crew
We don't fuck with neo-nazi spew
Say, "What's up?", to you, you, you, and you
You rollin' with the fucking Canberra Zoo

Spit up on your grave
Hope my thoughts behave, we so depraved
Spit up on your grave
Hope my thoughts behave, we so depraved
Hope your soul is safe
We gon' hold your fate
Hope your soul safe
We gon' hold your fate
Whip your hands, whip your ass
Whip your man's whip
This ain't the 50s, you ain't talkin' shit
Know your place, know your role
'Fore you get tripped
You ain't no masters
Your place has been flipped
Whip your hands, whip your ass
Whip your man's whip
This ain't the 50s, you ain't talkin' shit
Know your place, know your role
'Fore you get tripped
You ain't no masters
Your place has been flipped

Hope your soul is safe
We gon' hold your fate
Hope your soul is safe
We gon' hold your fate
Hope your soul is safe
We gon' hold your fate
Hope your soul is safe
We gon' hold your fate2Embed
