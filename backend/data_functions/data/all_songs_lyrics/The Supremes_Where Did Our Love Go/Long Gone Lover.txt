Long Gone Lover LyricsLong gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone, long gone
Let me tell you that he's far far away
But I think about him every day
In my dreams at night I see his face
Ain't no other guy gonna take his place
I just kiss his letter
And I feel better
He's been gone for such a long long time
But you know I'm sure that he's still mine
Though the things people say are hurting me
They're tryin' to make me think
He's deserting me
I just kiss his letter
And I feel better
Long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone, long gone
Long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone, long gone
I got a letter from him just this afternoon
Telling me that he'll be coming soon
Whenever I'm down and feeling bad
Whenever my heart is feeling sad
I just kiss his letter
And I feel better
Long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone lover
My baby is a long gone loverEmbed
