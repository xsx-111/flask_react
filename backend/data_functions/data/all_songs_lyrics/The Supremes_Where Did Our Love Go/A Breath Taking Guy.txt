A Breath Taking Guy LyricsOne night you held me tight
And whispered in my ear all night
Sweet words
Sweet words
I've never heard
Unheard
And I, believed every word
Next day you came my way
My way
And not a word you say
You passed me by
Me by
An eye
My darlin', won't you tell me why
You're actin' strange toward me?
Strange
Why have you changed toward me?
Changed
Are you just a breath-takin'
First sight soul-shakin'
One night love-makin'
Next day heart-breakin'
Guy
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Last night your love was true
Was true
The next day you were gone...
And I was blue
Was blue
And you were movin' on
Moved on
And I was left to cry alone
What have I done to you?
Done
Was it just fun to you?
Fun
Are you just a breath-takin'
First sight soul-shakin'
One night love-makin'
Next day heart-breakin'
Guy
Breath-takin', soul-shakin'
Love-makin', heart-breakin' guy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Breath-takin', soul-shakin'Embed
