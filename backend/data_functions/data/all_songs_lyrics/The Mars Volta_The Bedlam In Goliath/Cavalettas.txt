Cavalettas Lyrics
A salty ring of night fatigue
When I get, get, get the sweats from you listening
Primordial cymatics giving birth into reverse
Serrated mare ephemera undo her mother's curse

So if you break me a mirror
Hang the broken pieces of a place that isn't real
So if you don't hide that guilty smile, condolences won't go away

The coins you bring left footprints, blind thirst and Braille liquor
My bed is stained with fractures year after vitiated year
Four corners you are touching, they will liberate my need
Bite marks in the menagerie with infidelic teeth

So please break me a mirror
Hang the broken pieces of a place that isn't real
So if you don't hide that guilty smile, condolences won't go away

Is there something out there
Waiting to take hold?
When that whore won't answer
Who is in control?
And the names you planted
Drop the seed into a hole
And the names you planted
Drop the seed into a hole
If you force me often
I might jump off the board

I am a deaf con of angora goats
Warning you all who pass this mote
It's only a matter of folding time and space
Before I become your epidemic
Is this your first time at my conventicle?
You better not talk if you came here for semantics
It's only a matter of folding time and space
Before I become your epidemic


Don't ignore my presence
Hidden reads the scroll
By the time I asked her
The earth fell off the tongue
What once was laughter
Corrosive I became
What once was laughter
Corrosive I became
Where a scarlet bruise grows
Sprout the fault we own
I am a deaf con of angora goats
Warning you all who pass this mote
It's only a matter of folding time and space
Before I become your epidemic
Is this your first time at my conventicle?
You better not talk if you came here for semantics
It's only a matter of folding time and space
Before I become your epidemic

(Is the safety that you feel from the witness who has been hiding in the wings?)
Don't hide your guilty freight, condolences won't go away
You've got that guilty smile that culminates in Bedlam
(Is the safety that you feel from the witness who has been hiding in the wings?)
Don't hide your guilty freight, condolences won't go away
You've got that guilty smile that culminates in Bedlam
(Is the safety that you feel from the witness who has been hiding in the wings?)
Don't hide your guilty freight, condolences won't go away
You've got that guilty smile that culminates in bedlam
(Is the safety that you feel from the witness who has been hiding in the wings?)
Don't hide your guilty freight, condolences won't go away
You've got that guilty smile that culminates in bedlam
I am a deaf con of angora goats
Warning you all who pass this mote
It's only a matter of folding time and space
Before I become your epidemic
Is this your first time at my conventicle?
You better not talk if you came here for semantics
It's only a matter of folding time and space
Before I become your epidemic1Embed
