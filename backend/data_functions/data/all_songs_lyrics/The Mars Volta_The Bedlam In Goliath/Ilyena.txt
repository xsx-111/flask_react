Ilyena Lyrics
When the chants have cycled
How can I go wrong?
There will be no Eve for Adam
If your apples have gone, gone, gone, gone

I need a brand new skin
Incarnated debts
Incarcerated when
The deeds are left to purchase

If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins

Cypher is filled
Blanket of clots
Taking everything I've got
Please let me in, in, in, in

I need a brand new skin
Incarnated debts
Incarcerated when
The deeds are left to purchase
If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins

Follow me tonight
Follow me into oblivion
Follow me tonight
Follow me into oblivion

If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begin

I seem to hide in metal plates
Held together, alone, don't wait
Hide with me, identity
Until we've past due date

Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention, accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention, accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention, accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary1Embed
