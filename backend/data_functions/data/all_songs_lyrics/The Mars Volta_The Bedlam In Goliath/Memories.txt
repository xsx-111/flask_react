Memories LyricsI know I cannot leave this place
Full of memories
Things like the way they knew us
All over town
We used to walk the streets together
We could be seen
Past shops where people knew us
Yeah, people knew
I've got to choose between tomorrow
And yesterday
I can't stop to think about
My life, here today
Maybe I'll find someone to get you
Off my mind
Take me away from here
And leave it, leave it all behind
Memories can hang you up and haunt you
All your life, you know
Get so you cannot stay
And yet cannot go
I could find out where she's gone
Today I feel so unhappy
Streets seem so empty now
I want you with meEmbed
