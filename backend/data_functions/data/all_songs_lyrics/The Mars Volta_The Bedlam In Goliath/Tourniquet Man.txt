Tourniquet Man Lyrics
I've seen the only living traces flicker in the sulfur
And the ones who do believe me, place your favor
Before you lay your question down, there's a matter of the payment
To you, I slipped on crooked sores in conclaves that you bothered

Let me be your tourniquet man
Let me keep you as a favor
Let me be your tourniquet man
Let me keep you as a favor

When I hear your fingers, they will spell my name
As I trade the faces of the holders

Let me be your tourniquet man
Let me keep you as a favor
Let me be your tourniquet man
Let me keep you as a favor

I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
There's so much we can lose
I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
There's so much we can lose
I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
There's so much we can lose1Embed
