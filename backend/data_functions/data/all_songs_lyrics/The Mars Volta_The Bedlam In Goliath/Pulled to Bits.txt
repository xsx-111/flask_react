Pulled to Bits LyricsTongues are clacking words of one vision
One tiny incision and teeth are cracking
On thin air, on thin air
And teeth are cracking on thin air
Pulled to bits in silence
Left rotting on the ground
Slowly pulled to bits in silence
Without a sound, without a sound
Buildings bleached with shatter, shatter, clatter
Fill their senses with cement
Watch the people scatter
One by one, one by one
Pulled to bits in silence
Left rotting on the ground
Slowly pulled to bits in silence
Without a sound, without a sound
Young lungs snapping coming up for air
The mindless ones yapping, slashing through the thoroughfare
One by one, one by one
Oh, one by one without a fucking care
Pulled to bits in silence
Left rotting on the ground
Slowly pull to bits in silence
Without a sound, without a fucking sound
Pulled to bits, yackety, yackety, yack, yack, yack
Pulled to bits, shatter, shatter, shatter, clatter
Pulled to bits, yap, yap, yap, yapping
Pulled to bits without a soundEmbed
