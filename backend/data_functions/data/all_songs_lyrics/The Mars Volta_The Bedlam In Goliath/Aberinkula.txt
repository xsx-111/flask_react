Aberinkula Lyrics
Have you seen the living
Tired of their own shells?
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

Am I the one you're after
The novice made to find
Stray abhoration stalking
Plans that forgot me ninety-nine times
The only thing to alter
Stands in the way of you
I want your cramps to fit the fillings of my teeth

Have you seen the living
Tired of their own shells?
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

And don't you try and ask me
Your expiration date
Plans that forgot me ninety-nine times
You'll be the one who opens the gate
Carry water in a basket
Where the hole was dug the first time
The head that carries the body
A blood that flows through veins
Have you seen the living
Tired of their own shells?
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

And when it calls I'll answer
Do you need to repent
Plans that forgot me ninety-nine times
I'll stick around for ninety-nine times
The fault lines you prepare have darkened
Black rings instead of sight
Goliath, are you receiving?
Dismembered you've arrived

Have you seen the living
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well
