Askepios Lyrics
I'll be there waiting
With the hook in your neck as the contact you've made
Deficient

And your hand will break
If you touch this fence
Please them 'til they're blind with cleft lens

What have you brought for my appetite?
What have you brought for my appetite?

I'll never perish
With the albino horns of a thousand young born
Will you drink from the depths of my sea?

And your hand will break
If you touch this fence
Please them till they're blind with cleft lens

What have you brought for my appetite?
What have you brought for my appetite?
I might not make it back again
The vervain is on the rise
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
Got to open wide
Got to open wide
Might of a serpent swallowing tail
Cycle recycled and I'm next to nothing
I said

Help me come alive
Help me come alive
Help me come alive
Help me come alive

Place your ring finger on this debt
Am I living or am I dead?
Do what thou wilt, tell them what I've found
The steps of a ladder from a diamondback's mouth
I said

Help me come alive
Help me come alive
Help me come alive
Help me come alive
Help me come alive
Help me come alive
I ain't gonna hold my breath
I ain't gonna hold my breath1Embed
