Goliath Lyrics
That night I remember what you slipped in my glass
We came rewinding when
I foamed at the mouth while the lights winked at me
And now my shape is kept
The rain it can't hide, wash the paint from this hex
Is it so permanent?
Did she catch a left eye when it blinks three times
Or once just to seal you in?

In your drunken breath, did it stain like us?
In place of poison heat
I gotta rid this world of your intention
Swap the corpse in the casket

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Does he make you alright?

When I seep inside your truth through suspicious little coughs
You sank your nails inside a key while the door you shut closed up
The black stockings you kept, smell of wet cigarette
Torn of lust that you could not keep
I have slept inside your fault to have you keep me here on this leash
For the rest of your pets, I will feed to this theft
As we consummate the vows of defeat
And when you pray for an end to this
I do believe this is eternity
Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Your closet is bulging
White marrow withholding
Does it make you feel alright?


Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Your closet is bulging
White marrow withholding
Does it make you feel alright?

Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
All the days of my life, ever since I've been born
Never heard a man speak like this man before
Watch me now


Say it, say it, say it loud
Say it, say it, say it loud
Hold your heavy burden
In a pocket full of drink that I have drunk
Spit the remnants in your direction
This is the closest to any kingdom that you will come

I'm starting to feel a miscarriage coming on
It's numbing a stump clearing in my throat
And I just can't lose grip of it
She fumigated my mental hygiene
I'm all out of pulse
But I know you can resuscitate me

Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
All the days of my life, ever since I've been born
Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
All the days of my life, ever since I've been born
Never heard a man speak like this man before
Watch me nowEmbed
