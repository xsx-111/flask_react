Turn on Some Music Lyrics
Dreams of you my darling still
Are so fine, so fine, baby
Since I woke up
So is my state of mind
Since we've been apart
Oh I miss you, miss you with all my heart
Oh baby, what else can I say
Put on three albums
And let's fly baby
I've got to know
How much I love you so
I'm going to make you feel
That my love is strong for you tonight
Baby, I'm going to make it right
Put three albums on baby
We're going to make it long, long, long
Now when the music starts
I'm going to groove you slow and quiet
And when the first side's through
I'll still be into you
I'm getting sober
Let's get high and turn the record over
'Cos baby it's time for phase two, yeah
That's how it is, yeah
That's how it goes, hey
Just why it is, yeah
Nobody knows
'Cos music's been my therapy
Taking the pain from all my anatomy
Oh and my anatomy
It's my symphony, always stay with me
You know that the world ain't right
Baby, lots of people stay uptight
I'll go crazy
If something ever happened to my musical thrill
And darling your love is just like music
The second jam, girl is falling down
We've been one hour, still I got the power
Turn up the sound
Sounds drown out the screams
Come rock with me
Straight into Side B
The time has passed
An hour and a half
I love you baby
I'm strong enough to last
You, you and your music
Are more precious than gold baby
Two albums later baby
And I'm feeling great
You said wait, let's take a break
Before you play the last side
Are you fit enough to ride
I said yes, baby
Just let me catch my breath
Honey, honey, honey
Oh baby, I'm not through yet
This is one night honey, that you won't forget
I love you darling, I'm going to prove it tonight
Put on some music
Turn on some music
I've got some musicEmbed
