Midnight Lady Lyrics
So let me tell you 'bout last Saturday night, the club was rocking
Super freaks hanging out wall to wall
They tell me something's going on in the men's room
Soon as we come out we'll be high soon
Did you save a line for the ladies?
We're not into that are you crazy
Who's the super freak in the red dress?
When she starts to shake it, I can't take it
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Shake it baby, shake ya titties
We got the party, we got the sounds
We're off in the streets and all the freaks are getting down
Get in the groove baby, and boogie to the beat
Shake, shake your thing

You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You make me rock, you make me rock
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You turn me on, the way you dance, the way you dance
Midnight lady, sexy dancer
Hot and hardy, love to party
Check it out
We're jamming to love
Major love, minor love
Jamming to a great crescendo
Let's party baby, shake it, shake it
Party night to remember
Oh, everybody's having fun
Come on and party turn the green light on
When I saw you, I had to stop
I had to stop in the middle of a bop
I had to stop, I got the rhythm
I got the rhythm
Love is everywhere for the making
Freaks is everywhere for the taking
Blues is in the air if you sing it
Happiness come back if you bring it
I'm having me a good time

Midnight lady, midnight lady
Rocking and finger popping
Somebody said you was a super freak
I'm here to tell you I'm a super freak baby
Get in the groove
Get in the groove
Get in the groove
We got to rock, we got the rhythm
We got to come on down to the boogie
Feeling good
Check that classy rhythm
Give me that sexy beat
I dig that feeling jam
Midnight lady, sexy
You are the one I'm looking for
I never, never, never knew before
Oh, baby, you're looking too good
Super freakyEmbed
