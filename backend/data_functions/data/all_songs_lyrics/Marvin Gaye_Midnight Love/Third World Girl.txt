Third World Girl Lyrics
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love
Jamaica special love, hey Jamaica

Sitting down see the flower
On the window tops and the mountain
See the rain and the warm lit sun
On the beaches sand
Comes a man with a plan to renew the world
Up in Rasta land, hungry boys and girls
He lived up to his part
And he died with a cause in his heart

Jamaica special love
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Special love, listen
Oh baby, ohh, Jamaica lady
Ohh, Jamaica girl
Ohh, Jamaica lady
Ohh, Jamaica girl
You be my first, my second
My third world girl
My first, my second
My third world girl
Ohh, Jamaica lady
Ohh, Jamaica girl
You be my first, my second
My third world girl
My first, my second
My third world girl
Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as you
Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as you
Peas and rice, they awful nice
But not as nice as youEmbed
