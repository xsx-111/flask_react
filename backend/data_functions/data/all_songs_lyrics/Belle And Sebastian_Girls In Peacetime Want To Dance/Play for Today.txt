Play for Today Lyrics
I'm in a play written today about a boy
Who hides in attics when the sun is up
Everyone is at work
What will I do? Where will I go?
Show me the way
The truth, the anger, show me rules of thumb
Show the way to grow old
Love is a guide
The endless river of the soul
But we are mean
The dried up riverbeds of rock and stone
Lust is my friend
She comes to me when I am tired
Life is a rope, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap

I'm in a play written today about a girl
She gets on perfectly with young and old
Everybody loves her
What would she wear? The cut of her hair?
The way that she slides
Gracefully into the working week
She hides her baggage inside
She's got a friend
An ugly monster that will eat your face
She hides her crime
A hefty catalogue of wasted time
She's got a friend
A lonely monster that will prey on you
Life is a secret, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap
Life is a secret, death is a myth
Love is a fraud, it's misunderstood
Work is a sentence, family's a drag
This house is a trap

I'm in a play written today about a boy
Tired and melancholy, takes the weight
Takes the weight of the world
I walked alone, loving a song
Walking the earth
The worn-out sister who is twenty-three
Dried and wrinkled, alone
I'll give you a month
To see past shadows in your sacred mind
I'll give you a week
To look Medusa in the eye
I'll give you a month
To notice heaven in the sight of stage
(Author, author! Author, author!)

You're king inside your head
You're sitting on the throne of sand
You're pushing back the tide
So lift the mountain up
So tie the writer's ribbons down
Assemble all your troops
We go to war with metaphors
And suddenly see sense (And suddenly see sense)
And when you do, I'll have the higher ground (I'll have the higher ground)
You're not the king of me
I'll take my chance and play for tyranny
I build the sets, I light the scene
We're prettier when we are on the screen
I build the sets, I light the scene
We're braver when we're on the sacred screen
The backstage of your life
Is filled with props and lines you should have sung
The backstage of your life
Is filled with echoes of the ones you love3Embed
