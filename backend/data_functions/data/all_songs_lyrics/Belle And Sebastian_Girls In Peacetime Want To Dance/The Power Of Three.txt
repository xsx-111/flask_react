The Power Of Three LyricsSome people say two is company
Sherlock Holmes found the sign of four
I don't listen to that number theory
I'm always looking for a trio, them and me
One for all and we're all for one
Musketeers have got to have the power of three
Every time I read the horoscope, I read three
Virgo, Pisces, Aquarius
Nobody can tell what's down the road for us
He could be Holmes, I'll be Watson
Every hero, yes even me
Everybody has their Moriarty
Keep your friends close
Your enemies at your side
Always keep your green eyes open wide
Depth perception, a change of direction
And all signs point to a bumpy ride
Then I saw the fourth dimension, another line
Move in space, and we can move in time
Everything existed right from the start
It's the blink of an eye
It's the beat of a heart
It's the beat of a heart
We've got enemies and nemeses
There's a world of possibility
In everything you leave a clue
A little trace, a sign of youEmbed
