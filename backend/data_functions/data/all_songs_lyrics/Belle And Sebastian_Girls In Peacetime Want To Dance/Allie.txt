Allie Lyrics
Allie, what would you do?
When there's bombs in the Middle East, you want to hurt yourself
When there's knives in the city streets, you want to end yourself
When there's fun in your mother's house, you want to cry yourself to sleep

Allie, what would you do?
With your fears, because they're adding one by one
And your mountains are obscured behind the sun
And the person that you could be is crumbling into dust

You're in the mess 'cause you thought
You'd be someone else

But the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a
Tricks in your head are a lie

Allie, hand on your head
And a prayer from the soon-to-be-closing library
And if you looked from here, you would surely see
There's a softness in your heart, there's a poetry to come
You bought that gun cause you thought
You'd be someone else

But the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a
Tricks in your head are a lie

You made a list of all your heroes
And you thought about what they went through
Yeah, you thought about what they went through
It's much darker, much harder, than anything that happened to you


Allie, what would you do?
When your seven-year plan happens to someone else
And the people in your life you would happily shelf
When day falls night, you are truly on your own?

You're in this place cause you thought
You'd be someone else
But the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a
Tricks in your head are a lie

Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a lie
Yeah, the tricks in your head are a
Tricks in your head are a lie1Embed
