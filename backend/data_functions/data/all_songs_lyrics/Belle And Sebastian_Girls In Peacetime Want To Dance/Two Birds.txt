Two Birds LyricsTwo birds sitting on a wire
Big one makes his move
He spreads his feathers, rubs his beak
Boy and girl are leaving school
He is shy, but she will follow him
She don’t know why
Life is short, and then you sleep
Pull down the wall
It’s only masking honesty
Pull down the wall
It’s breaking up the family
Pull down the wall
Hear the true call
Start the day with little things
They’ll blossom into prayers and little wings
Look at what is in your heart
How could it be wrong?
The little man is telling you
People gathering in the square
They’ve had enough
Their leaders they are killing them
Life is short, and then you sleep
Pull down the wall
It’s only masking honesty
Pull down the wall
It’s breaking up the family
Pull down the wall
Hear the true call
Start the day with little things
They’ll blossom into prayers and little wings
When all the banks began to fail
I thought that we would have a change
But they found all this cash
We didn’t have to patch it up again
They never think to spend the money
On the everlasting broke
Or the sick, what a waste
Two birds in the promised land
One is building walls to keep the other in its place
Imprisoned like the special son
He became the greatest, broke his chains and busted out
Life is short, and then you sleep
Pull down the wall
It’s only masking honesty
Pull down the wall
It’s breaking up the family
Pull down the wall
Hear the true call
Start the day with little things
They’ll blossom into prayers and little wingsEmbed
