Ever Had a Little Faith? (Extended Version) LyricsWith your headphones on
Through the drizzled pane
Of a wet slate roof
Sun will turn to rain
Why are you the one?
Couldn't take the pain
Something good will happen, wait and see
Something good will happen, wait and see
Do you spend your day
Second guessing faith?
Looking for a way
To live so divine
Drop your sad pretence
You'll be doing fine
You will flourish like a rose in June
You will flourish like a rose in June
Ever had a little faith?
Ever had a little faith?
Morning came
The hope grows up in your heart, girl
Without a shame
And morning came
Roll away the stone of doubt, girl
If you'll come, then listen out for
A quiet voice, a sign from the window
Passion beating on your brow
You wish it were, you wish it was
Pass the sound of driving traffic
Pass a madman's drunken attic
You climb the stair
It's dark and it's drafty
The smell of incense drawing you
Sky of light imploring you to
Venture out from street to street
Look up and down
She must have missed him
If she could only find him
She would throw her arms around and kiss him
Tenderly, she would give herself on bended knee
Never thinking if it's wrong or right
Hurry sister, there's a little light
Ever had a little faith?
Ever had a little faith?
Who can you trust?
Trust a little man
Whispers in the trees
And a river can
Speak the coming verse
From the age of break
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Something good will come from nothing
Wide open to new surprises
Wide open to dark surprises
Here comes the time for you
For you to change
For you to change
The river takes a long way down
Takes a long way down
The river, the river takes a long way down
Takes a long way down
Something good will come from faith
Something, something
The long way down
The long way down
The long way down
It's coming up, it's coming upEmbed
