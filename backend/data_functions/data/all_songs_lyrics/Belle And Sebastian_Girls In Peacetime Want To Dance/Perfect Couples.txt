Perfect Couples Lyrics
I know some friends of mine
Think about them all the time
Why can't my life be like that?
I've seen them in the park
Restauranting after dark
Working out on their yoga mats
Stars of the dance hall crowd
Married young, took their vows
Comfort in their boldness and their flair
Dab hands for all to see
Stroke of brush and poetry
His cut of cloth, the contours of her hair

Thank you for the invite tonight
Perfect snacklets, perfect drinks
I'm getting ideas from your interiors
Perfect apartments, perfect kids

Perfect couples are breaking up
What have they done?
Those perfect couples are breaking up
What have they done?
Don't make me feel so good
Expect that stuff in Hollywood
Not in my current milieu
Sexual tension at the fridge
He makes for the organic figs
Belmondo lips, dangling a cig
And she, just back from her hike
And to the gallery she might glide by
With a basket on her bike

They've got issues too
But what can you do?
Bad times
They'll always see them through

(It always lurked in their mind)
Perfect couples are breaking up
What have they done?
(In the back of her mind)
Perfect couples, they keep breaking up
What have I done?
(It always lurked in his mind)
Those perfect couples
Are now breaking up
What have they done?
(In the back of their minds)
Perfect couples, they keep breaking up
What have I done?
Never happy with my girl
Jealous of a different world
Suddenly the years slip away

What am I waiting for?
(I see those perfect couples and I)
What makes me close the door?
I see those perfect couples
(Why can't I be like them?)
I admire the most
Finding fault with my heart
(It's always been the same and then)
And always back to the start
What makes me get in the fray
Then just throw it away
Yeah, I throw it away
Yes I throw it away (only to find)
Yes I throw it away (only to find)
Perfect couples are breaking up...1Embed
