Born to Act LyricsThere is a girl on the floor, she dances way out
She’s a snub nose beauty, she’s a no doubt
But if I talk to her, I even look hard
She’ll be out of this place and she’ll be out of my life
So we busted a move we got the hell out
We got stories to tell, we got our whole life
We drink coffee till late because we jet lagged
We put a fortune into the greatest
Music machine in the land
Play a wonderful song to me and it’s better than a date
Play the tune where the girl sings high
She’s my lover surrogate
And the waitress is rolling by, shining high
Smiling for a tip
Every boy dreams of it
So the girl dances in, she takes the next booth
I break the rule of my life, I make a big move
'Cause my accent is funny, got a head start
If you wanna make good, you got to use what you got
We go with her friends and there’s a big crowd
There’s a girl who can’t stand up till she falls down
There’s a pressure that’s building and it’s too late
'Cause she leaves in the morning, there’s a flight
It’s a family affair
Play a wonderful song to me and it’s better than a date
Play the tune where the girl sings high
She’s my lover surrogate
And the waitresses rolling by, shining high
Smiling for a tip
Every boy dreams of it
So we met a month later, she had long hair
She was driving the bus I paid the full fare
It was easy to talk and she drove real fast
And she told me the story of her dirty old past
All the boys she had loved and all the bad sex
All the things she must learn and all her prospects
I was there for the ride and for the old soul
But we couldn’t go further, no we couldn’t go
But we couldn’t go further, no we couldn’t go
But we couldn’t go further 'cause the story was already toldEmbed
