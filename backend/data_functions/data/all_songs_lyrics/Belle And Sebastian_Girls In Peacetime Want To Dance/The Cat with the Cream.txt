The Cat with the Cream LyricsSitting at the old kitchen table
Peace and love and dreams, stretching out in the darkness
Mother’s up the stairs with her aging new boyfriend
Cathy’s staying in to make sure nothing happens
All aboard the freak parade
I cover up my head and pray
I'm praying for the light
Down amongst the old city chambers
Men in frocks debate all the policy changes
Everybody bet on the boom and got busted
Everybody bet and in the government trusted
Grubby little red MP
Yellow flapping hopelessly
Tory like the cat with the cream, Tory like the cat with the cream
I studied you in history, I studied in the library
In days of old when knights were bold
They'd settle it with sword and shield
In days of old when knights were bold
It's settled by the king
Praying for a friend is contagious
Specially when it comes at the old kitchen table
Listening for the swoosh of his quickening paces
Watching for the smile on the bravest of faces
How I wish you'd read to me
Verses rich in swallows and trees
To get me through the night
Waiting at the old kitchen table
Listening for my code listening for my instructions
Surely now I'm here, I am destined for greatness
I want to be the Queen pulling kids out of rivers
All aboard the freak parade
I cover up my head and pray
Praying for the cat with the cream, praying for the cat with the cream
I studied you in history, I studied in the library
In days of old when knights were bold
They'd settle it with sword and shield
In days of old when knights were bold
It's settled by the king
It's settled by the king
It's settled by the king
It's settled by the kingEmbed
