The Book Of You Lyrics
Everybody's making plans
For tomorrow
Stone could turn to sand
But I just
I want to take you back in time
I'll draw the line
And I would write a different story
A new final act
I don't need the drama
But I would never write you out
Everyone's a thread, we're woven together
Read it in the tears and fraying edges
Read the book of you, the book of me
We're fading into memory
But something is left
A gesture, a phrase, or a photograph
The warp and weft

We're always walking in the rain
And you're just trouble, so I claim
But then the world can see
That I'm the one for you
And you're the one for me
Valentine, if you could change
With the weather
Faith would just evaporate
Untethered
In a fresh disguise
I'll catch your eye
And see behind the mask
And find you never went far
But that's not the last time
I've thought about the way we are
We're always walking in the rain
And you're just trouble, so I claim
But then the world can see
That I'm the one for you
And you're the one for meEmbed
