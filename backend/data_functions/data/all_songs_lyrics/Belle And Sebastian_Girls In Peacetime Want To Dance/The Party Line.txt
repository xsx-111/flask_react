The Party Line Lyrics
How did I get here
I heard a rumour
From your girlfriend's sister
That you knew me
And you end up dancing
Closer to me
I know that I broke the rule already
She asked me if I'm single
Going steady
I just drop my head and took a step off into the dark

Standing on the black and white tiles
Don't dance on the lights because the bears eat the pretty ones
We are like the islands divided

Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is no one in here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line
Stay
You stay
I am on this morning quite distracted
The tug of war begins in our emotion
I am leaving many people feeling
Worse than before
People like to drive the cars and smoke up
People like to sit inside and toke up
People like to shoot at things with borrowed guns
And knives

I am happy to look and run
Where were you when I was king in this part of town?
Now the days of glory are gone

Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is no one in here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is no one in here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is no one in here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
Jump to the beat of the party line
There is no one in here but your body dear
Jump to the beat of the party line2Embed
