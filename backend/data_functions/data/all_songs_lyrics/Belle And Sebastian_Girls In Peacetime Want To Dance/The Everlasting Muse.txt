The Everlasting Muse Lyrics
I want to find this girl I know
I need to take her out
I set a snare in evening air
Made of faith and hope and doubt
I want to spend some time with her
Learn the secrets of her trade
I wouldn't mean to cross the line
And look into the other side
Forbidden to my kind
Forbidden to my kind

I need to hang out with my love
The raven-headed sprite
I know I'll never dance like her
Or keep her up at night
I need to hang around with her
I need to let her know
Her cause is mine
I'm but a slave
I look into her wondrous gaze
And taste the strangest chord
And make the purest noise

What I would do to meet the girl
I'd stand out in the rain
Outside my window watching close, she will appear again
Still polishing her crazy nail
Still wispy, careless, drunk on song
If I could only right my wrongs and take her to my favourite place
And steal a melody
Cause I need only see her face
And doubts and worries fall away
And music rushes in
Listen to the sound of life
(I don't want to be friends)
Drink deep of the day
(I don't need your advance)
Wait for her, but don't obsess
(Why do you have to ask?)
She'll go the other way
(No, I don't want to dance)

Winds will blow and storms will rage
(But your phrases are poor)
The muse is always sad
(And you try hard to rhyme)
Money tends to disappear
(And I can't read your words)
Beauty crumbles with the years
(But I can read your mind)
But music is for us
(Music is for us)
Music is for us
(Music is for us)

If I could only see her face and know that she was close
There is a deeper magic here, the everlasting muse
I left the danger for an hour
I left the sadness for a day
I know that I am in safe hands
She pays the bill and smokes cigar
And on the napkin silk
She weaves a manuscript with skill
An intro, outro, middle eight
A tapestry of words
A subtle gift to modern rock
She says, "be popular, play pop
And you will win my love"
A subtle gift to modern rock
She says, "be popular, play pop
And you will win my love"3Embed
