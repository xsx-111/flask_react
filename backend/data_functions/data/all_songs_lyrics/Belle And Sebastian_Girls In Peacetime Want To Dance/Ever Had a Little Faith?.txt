Ever Had a Little Faith? LyricsWith your headphones on
Through the drizzled pane
Of a wet slate roof
Sun will turn to rain
Why are you the one?
Couldn't take the pain
Something good'll happen
Wait and see
Something good'll happen
Wait and see
Do you spend your day
Second guessing fate?
Looking for a way
To live so divine
Drop your sad pretence
You'll be doing fine
You will flourish like a row in June
You will flourish like a row in June
Ever had a little faith?
Ever had a little faith?
Morning came
The hope rose up in your heart, girl
You felt ashamed
When morning came
Roll away the stone of doubt, girl
If you're calm then listen out for
A quiet voice, a sign from the window
Passion beating on your brow
You wish it were, you wish it was now
Past the sound of driving traffic
Past the madman's drunken attic
You climb the stair
It's dark and it's draughty
The smell of incense drawing you
Sky of light imploring you to
Then she ran from street to street
Looked up and down
She must have missed him
If she could only find him she would
Throw her arms around
And kiss him tenderly
She would give herself on bended knee
Never thinking if it's wrong or right
Courage sister there's a little light
Ever had a little faith?
Ever had a little faith?
Who can you trust?
Trust the little man
Whispers in the trees
And the river can
Speak the calming verse
From the age of brave
Something good
Will come from nothing
Something good
Will come from nothing
Ever had a little faith?
Ever had a little faith?Embed
