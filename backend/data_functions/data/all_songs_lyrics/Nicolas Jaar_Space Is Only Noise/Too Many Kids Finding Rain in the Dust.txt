Too Many Kids Finding Rain in the Dust LyricsToo many fathers asking too many favors
Too many kids finding rain in the dust
Too many lords saying house in the club
I'll bring you downtown to show you around
But you won't find the time to kiss kiss kiss
Too many fathers finding rain in the dust
I'll bring you downtown to show you around
But you won't find the time to kiss kiss kiss2Embed
