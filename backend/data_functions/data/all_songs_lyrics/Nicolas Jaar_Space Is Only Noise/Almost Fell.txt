Almost Fell LyricsThe earth rises away from the shore
A human figure slopes up from the ground
Its toes touched toes of its mirror image
Another human figure facing it
The bottom half of this figure is cut into the earth and filled with water that has streamed inland
The top half of the figure is a plain of grass
That stretches offshore and descends underwater
The monuments have been brought down to earth
And made part of land and waterEmbed
