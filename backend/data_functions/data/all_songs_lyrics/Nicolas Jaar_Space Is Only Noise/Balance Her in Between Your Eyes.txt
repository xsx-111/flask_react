Balance Her in Between Your Eyes LyricsYou can try to find the star that made you
You can try to find that speck of light in your eye
You can look into and see the eye that made you
The light that made you
But you might aswell make yourself at home balance at home
Put both feet in the thin line of light
And look into the eye that made you
Tell her you see her
Balance her in between your eyesEmbed
