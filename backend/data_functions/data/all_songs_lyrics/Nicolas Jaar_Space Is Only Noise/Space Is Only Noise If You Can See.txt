Space Is Only Noise If You Can See LyricsSpace is only noise if you can see
See, I want to write a story about two long lines
Two pretty lines that fall in love
Two little spaces, they're filled with echoes
One point below to each space
Did the lines ever intersect one another
At a moment in time?
Have you always cross like this?
Have you always cross like this?
Have you been this way all the time
Or were you always trying to get here with me?
With me? With me? With me?
You used to check the weather, now you stopped that
You used to look at time, now you stopped that
You used to wear red, now you wear white
What happens all the time, it happens all the time
Replace the word "space" with a drink and forget it
Space is only noise if you can see
Grab a calculator and fix yourself
Grab a calculator and fix yourself
Read the news, baby, read the news
Watch your clock, baby, watch your clock
Watch the weather, baby, on TV
It's all together if you can see
Grab a calculator and fix yourself
Space is only noise if you can see
See I want to write a story about two long lines
Two pretty lines that fall in love
Two little spaces they're filled with echoes
Did the lines ever intersect one another, at a moment in time?5Embed
