Via the Spectrum Road LyricsWe're on the road
No heavy load
No one alone
Crying out loud
Before the crowd
Gets in the way
Don't get run down
We're comin' down
Via the Spectrum Road
Laid on the ground
In every town
We got a plane
If when we play
Loving each day
Hear what we say
Floating out there
Suspension
Transporting band
Throughout the land
Via the Spectrum Road
Spectrum Road
Finding the note
Habit of life
Denying divorce
Club owner's wife
Causes strife
We are the cause
She's got new drugs
It's all a joke
She's got some smoke
Hippies like that
Via the Spectrum Road
Spectrum Road
Decisions are made
Your life is fray
Keeping in step (step!)
Reducing the low
Extending our souls
Via the Spectrum Road
Floating out there
