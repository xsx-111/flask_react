Beyond Games LyricsWhy don't you say what you mean
Cos, you didn't mean what you said
When you're aware
It's knowing, that there
Are People
Who are sharing
Yeah...
Sharing
Mmm Mmm Mmm
Sharing
All, your fear
You know everything is said in the bed
And it shouldn't change just cos you're wed
That's Right
You heard me
Oohh
Why don't you say what you mean, baby?
Cos, I didn't understand what you said
Just be aware
That there are people
Who are trying, oh trying to share
You hear that?
They're sharing
All of their fears
You know what that's about
I told you everything is said in the bed
Everything, and it shouldn't change just cos you're wed
Cos it's all the same
Yeah
I know it
Just don't be afraid now to stand up, when it counts
Give in sometime, it's nice
Cos it can be fun!
It's got to be fun, don't you know?
Cos it's havin' fun that you grow!
OohhEmbed
