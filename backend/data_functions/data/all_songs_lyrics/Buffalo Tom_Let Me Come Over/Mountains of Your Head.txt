Mountains of Your Head LyricsI've been turned on
In that little room
And I am all caved in now like a cat
I've woken up
'Cause you've spoken up
I'm catatonic but ready to roll
Drift sense of time
Turning round on a dime
Crossed the thin line
As I'm waving goodbye
You saved my life
Now once or twice
And I'm not willing to let it go
Mountains of your head
Come back in dreams
And I'm thinking true pencil thoughts
Hell hath no fury
I'm restless but weak
What's on your mind
If it's on your tongue you should speak
Speak
It's true
She was spinning and
She was hinting at
And sweeping dust in and out of rooms
What could I do?
I'm asking you
I made myself invisible to her
Hell hath no fury
I'm restless but weak
What's on your mind
If it's on your tongue you should speak
Speak
It's trueEmbed
