Staples LyricsStaple my hand
Staple my hands to my heart
Staple my hand
Staple my lips shut
Staple my hand
Staple my lips shut
I'm staying right here
I won't move 'til I'm dead
I'm staying right here
You can cut me in two instead
I'm staying right here
I won't move 'til you're dead
But you can move me over my head
I'm raking up threats here
I've left the gypsies outside
I'm make bets dear
I just woke up one morning and died
I'm staying right here
Your staples have stitched deep inside
And you can move me over my head
But you can move me over my head
But you can move me over my head
And you can move me over my headEmbed
