Velvet Roof LyricsHere she comes across the street
But I'm already there downstairs to meet with her
She could make my life complete
But I'm already there to compete with her
Climb aboard my velvet roof
And smile showing me one golden tooth
A simple gesture yes or no
Would have been enough to let me know
Scraggly hair and messed up shoes
I'm looking all around for you
Find you in the corner bar
But you can't find the keys to your car
She's as sharp as a razor blade
But she could cut my wrists open just the same
Softer than my velvet floor
Gatherin' up the veil and going home
Scraggly hair and messed up shoes
I'm looking all around for you
Find you in the corner bar
But you can't find the keys to your car
She's as sharp as a razor blade
But she could cut my wrists open just the same
Softer than my velvet floor
Gatherin' up the veil and going home
Hey man what's the matter with
Hey man what's the matter with you
Hey man what's the matter with
Hey man what's the matter with you
Hey man what's the matter with
Hey man what's the matter with you
