Saving Grace LyricsCan't get rid of this blue sun
It's been so long since I've had fun
She's wearing a special dress
We're in a terrible mess
It's been so long since I've been home
Since I've had fun
I'm coming home
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
My retreat's in my head
Take back those things that you said
I might as well have been dead
But I'm staying sane instead
I've saved my face
Saving grace
Saving grace
It's been so long since I've been home
I'll be there soon, soon, soon
My retreat's in my head
Take back those things that you said
I might as well have been dead
But I'm staying sane instead
I've saved my face
Saving grace
Saving grace
It's been so long since I've been home
Since I've been home
I'm coming home
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
Yeah, I'm coming home
I'll be there soon
I'll be there soon
SoonEmbed
