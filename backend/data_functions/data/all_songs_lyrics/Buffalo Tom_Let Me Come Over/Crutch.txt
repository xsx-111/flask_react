Crutch LyricsLeaving
She came along
She came a long way to see me
She came across snowy fields
Baby - I've almost grown somehow
I'm in between the coasts
But my mind
My mind must be back in Boston
And you're all above the moon
And you're all above the moon
I'm lying across the tracks
And I'm on the train ride back
Slowly - I turned to him and said
"Well if I'm not yet dead then surely
This must be killing me instead"
Turning - I am turning blue
In this bar with you but my mind
Must be back in San Francisco
And you're all above the moon
And you're all above the moon
I'm lying across the tracks
And I'm on the train ride back
And I'm in between the cars
And I'm in between the stars
And you're all above the moon
And you're all above the moon
Highways - my head is loose at last
The radio's on full blast
And I'm rolling
In a midnight Chevrolet
Snowdust - I'm caught dead in the night
The stars and fire light
The sky a jewel
I believe I'm back in Boston
And you're all above the moon
And you're all above the moon
I'm lying across the tracks
And I'm on the train ride back
And I'm in between the cars
And I'm in between the stars
And you're all across the moon
And you're all above the moon
And you're all across the moon
And you're all above the moon
The MoonEmbed
