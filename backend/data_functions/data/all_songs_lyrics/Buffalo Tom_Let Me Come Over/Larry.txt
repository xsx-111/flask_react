Larry LyricsWhen I sleep is when you rise
Get out of bed wipe the sleep from your eyes
I shut my eyes - all the world drops dead
Now's the time friend of mine
With a passage to
A passage from
Your daily missal
We taught that
Cat to crawl
When I sleep is when you rise
Get out of bed wipe the sleep from your eyes
My heart and soul are in your hands
Now's the time friend of mine
With a passage to
A passage from
Your daily missal
We taught that
Cat to crawl
Now's the time friend of mine
And now's the time friend of mineEmbed
