Stymied LyricsBroken
By words left unspoken
I thought you was joking
The words you say
Stymied
Please come untie me
You're lying right beside me
Don't lie to me
Lying
I caught you lying
You caught me trying
Don't let me catch you lying
Lazy
Open up the daisies
And lay my so lazy soul to sleep
Hoping
I was not joking
Was merely choking
The words got caught
Lying
You caught me lying
I caught you trying
Don't let me catch you lying
Lying
I caught you lying
You caught me trying
Don't let me catch you lying
Lazy
Daisy
Lazy
