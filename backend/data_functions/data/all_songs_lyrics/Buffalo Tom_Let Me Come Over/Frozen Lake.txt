Frozen Lake LyricsI'm between the lines just one more time
Read it in a book I almost looked
In the frozen lake she comes and takes
Give up my whole world she's just a girl
In my frozen mind I'm stuck in time
I can't get past this thing for one more spring
See, she fits to me so easily
I, I'm borderline almost everytime
Give up my whole world
She's a translucent girl
In my frozen mind I'm lost in time
I take one more breath it's worse than death
Turn on all the lights alive with fright
See, she fits to me too easily
I, I'm borderline almost everytime
Give up my whole world
She's a complicated girl
In my frozen mind I'm stuck in time
Give up my whole world
She's a complicated girl
In the frozen lake she comes and takesEmbed
