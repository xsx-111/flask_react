Mineral LyricsAll spangled up, glittering on
There's a monster in the kitchen - his lights's turned on
Thanks for coming - it meant a lot
But you sure do know how to put me on the spot
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
You came into the kitchen - a rose held high
I never want to see young flowers die
And hearing all that made me feel like a spy
To tell you any different would be to lie
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
"Merry Christmas" you said to me
Empty drawers - nothing left for me
We turned around now and what did we see?
All our whispers and transparencies
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
You're so green
So green
So green
So greenEmbed
