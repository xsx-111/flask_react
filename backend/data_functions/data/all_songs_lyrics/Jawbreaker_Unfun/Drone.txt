Drone LyricsGo ahead burn
What you can't hide
Try to unlearn
What's clear to the eye
It's a matter of fact
But fact don't fit
We gotta rewrite
Rewrite
We recount the dead
Two makes one now
We're counting on our hands
We're out of fingers
We shower in your blood
And crawl inside you
You harden in our form
Like statues statues
Alone in this place
The others are gone
I wire the base
They say push on
The salt's in my eyes
The fire's in my lungs
I take my best shot
I'm shot!
We recount the dead
Two makes one now
We're counting on our hands
We're out of fingers
We shower in your blood
And crawl inside you
You harden in our form
Like statues statues
Drone
Drone
Drone
Fact and fictions all blurred to fit them
Drone
Drone
Drone
The ceaseless hum. The factory drumEmbed
