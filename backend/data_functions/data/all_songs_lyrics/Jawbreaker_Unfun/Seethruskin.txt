Seethruskin LyricsYou're undecided
You ride a fence but that fence divides
No side is still a side
A look in your eyes says I hold myself above you
You can't see through my skin
Hey, don't think that I ain't counting all the things you do
I'll hold a floodlamp to you and burn you in your awful truth
Born without a choice of race
Held to blame and put in place
See through skin and look at all that lies within
I know that this can't cure it but if it bends and ear then hear it
You, watch what you do
You've gotta unlearn it
It's a sickness that keeps returning
You need open heart
Enough of your joking
You're gonna wind up choking
Some words still can kill
Hey, what kind of friend would understand a joke
Could stand a joke so cruel?
Hey, color's just another number tattooed with a blunt old toolEmbed
