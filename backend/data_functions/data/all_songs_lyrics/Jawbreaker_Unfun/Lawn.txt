Lawn LyricsMan on his lawn, staring inside his house
And it looks so strange, he doesn't know anyone
Familiar faces, still none to recognize
The walk around, in the glass house he fell through
He sees strange now
Left behind
Took off one day, he ran an errand
He kissed his kids, started walking and couldn't stop
Wandered for years, looking for the good life
There's no such thing
Just life itself
Still staring in, two children playing
The knot unwinds, the thaw beings inside
His wife walks out, she walks right through him
He disappears, the sky clearsEmbed
