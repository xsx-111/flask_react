Crane LyricsTakes a crane to pick me up
A twenty gallon coffee cup
A metal flag to move my brow
Indelible's my color now
Forever is the time it takes to get me going
Can you wait?
I'll be along any year
Progress slowed by heightened fear
I got a broken crown
I went from king to clown
Don't think I'm down
A fool's got so much less to lose
I see your life's a race I can't run
You curse the man who fired the gun
Concrete socks and cement shoes
The race was fixed I'm gonna lose it
There's danger in a desperate man
Watch yourself I'm panicking
I know my time is almost done
It's now or never
Never comes
We're young yet
Too young to regret it
I see you play it safe
If you had a dime I bet you wouldn't bet it
Well that's cool
What's advice from a fool?
Just hear me out
This is what I'm all about
Twenty-one in need of fun
Growing old
In a band to understand a fucked up world
Twenty-two it could be through
Enlist now
No one knows where it is going, but it's up from down
Could well be I'm full of shit
Saying never guarantees it
Still I'm not some posicreep
Reality my soul do keep
Living on the brighter side
Living only half a life
I keep my feet tied to the ground
I let my head go wander 'roundEmbed
