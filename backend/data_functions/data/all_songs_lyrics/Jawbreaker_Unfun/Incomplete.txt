Incomplete LyricsWe hear your one hand clapping
It's music to our ears
You don't like the way we sound
We don't like the way you hear
Sorry we ain't hard enough to piss your parents off
Hatred's not our policy
We tried that game and lost
You keep saying you're just killing time
Be careful
You're killing some of mine
I don't want it
Keep it to yourself
You can't help it
So put it on a shelf
Well hate makes hate
It percolates
You're brewing up a storm
This song's the head of your coffee spoon
Mirroring your form
The distortion's pretty accurate
I'd say your head's about that size
Your vision's been so striken by those beady little eyes
And all the broken nursery rhymes
Old hopes cracked open by cynical minds
We'll try to work them out sometime
I wouldn't want to be so cool in a world about to freeze
You're so hard you're brittle
You shatter easily
And no one's there to pick you up
'cause you fucked with all your friends
Lying there like an unpieced puzzle nobody can mendEmbed
