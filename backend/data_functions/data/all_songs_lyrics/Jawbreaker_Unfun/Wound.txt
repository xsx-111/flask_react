Wound LyricsTried to squeeze my eyes and scrape up my skin
There's a hole in my head where the bullet went in
I think it's all in your heart
And I think it's all in your mind
You just got to split the difference
Tell me what it is you find
Feel my burning rash
Old scabs on my back
Deep red welts from hating myself
I was once
Once so strong
Things seemed sure
Things long gone
Don't look
Don't look down
Will I ever be part of the here and the now?
And if I am my world
Then this planet it won't last
It keeps running down
It's fading so fast1Embed
