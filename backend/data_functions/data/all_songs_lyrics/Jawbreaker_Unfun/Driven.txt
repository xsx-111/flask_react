Driven LyricsA darker power
Thick blood inside a flower
A beast who preys on love
Love?
The need is there
It supersedes the care
Driving the flesh to merge this urge
It's come to killing
Laugh
The reckless ones who need fulfilling
Doesn't matter much
A senseless murder
Anything for a laugh
Only in death will she forget
You meant to love but found you hurt her
Everyone is out of touch
And no one wants to learn
What I'm talking about is a city full of fear and doubt
And I'd like to see it burn
He has a larger plan
She moves his hand
The end
He thinks she'll like it in the end
It was the screaming
A part of her got too close
I understand it
A drowning man grabs all he can
The kind of truth that hurts the most
Just tell it to her friend
Friend
It makes us kill and then it soothes us
Some call it a right
Hunger moves us
I call it a wrongEmbed
