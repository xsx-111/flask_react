Softcore LyricsI'm putting on my blinders
I'm walking straight to me
I'm following my carrot
It's plenty hard to reach
Keep your foot out of my door
I don't want you on my floor
Yeah
Take it from the source
Yeah
It's killing my softcore
I'm dressed in my best soul
You drag it through the mud
I'd like to keep my skin on
It's holding in my blood
Open wounds that never heal
You're the flies and I'm the meal
Don't listen
It's not the truth just because it glistens
It's painted
The coloration's tainted
Skin looks good on paper to a million hungry eyes
They just want the wrapping
They throw away the prize
Show her body
Fuck her mind
Fuck her body
Why's she crying?Embed
