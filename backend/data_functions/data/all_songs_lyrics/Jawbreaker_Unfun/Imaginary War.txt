Imaginary War LyricsUnderwater screams
He's so far gone
Drowned out by the unseen powers in unseen ways
Fists clenched to fight
It's a fearless wall
Takes your soul and grinds it all
Let it go
Some things aren't meant to be now
Battlesore
Why fight a war that's been decided?
Change your course
Feel out your enemy now
Realize you can't fight a war without a weapon
Ran off to war but you couldn't find the battlesite
Seems you missed the fight
It's imaginary
Causes, clauses clog your mind with their spite
Like the preacherman who lectures hard on supersin
He's soon found out in bed
Too long engaged sleeping with your ideas
Now you're your best source
Arms pinned to your side
Your mind's on fire
It's got you firmly in it's grasp
A keyless clasp
If you had an edge you just might cut loose
But you've been dulled with age and ease
Your muscles seized
Please beware
You should prepare yourself now
Nevermore
Don't come to class without your homework
Resign yourself
It takes work to make it here now
Realize you can't fight a war without a weapon
Ran off to war but you couldn't find the battlesite
Seems you missed the fight
It's imaginary
Causes, clauses clog your mind with their spite
Like the preacherman who lectures hard on supersin
He's soon found out in bed
Too long engaged sleeping with your ideas
Now you're your best source.(x2)Embed
