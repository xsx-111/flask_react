Eye-5 LyricsIn unbearable traffic
Radio and it's deafening static
I got my dick in my hand
Super sanitary garbage man
Bearing down the interstate
Feeling hate for hate's sake
Though it may sound strange, angels call my name
The gun felt good in my hand
Like an angel in the devil's land
While it seems insane, I hold them to blame
Hood ornament in my trusty sight
The time has come to put things right
I am here to make things clean
Man, oh man, what a violent scene
Target! Target! Woman! Whore!
This is it
The holy war
Steady now
Draw back the hammer
Blinding flash
Nothing's the matter
I should be king
Though it might sound strange, angels call my name
While it seems insane, I hold them to blame
Angels do the strangest things
Her foot turns to lead on the pedal
Got a good feeling
Multiple collision, the flesh it settles
'Bout time I beat my wings
Across town, another job in need of doing
Glass, gas, a punctured lung
My arm's all fucked, in need of some gluing
An angel's work is never done
Crank up the box, dig the noise between stations
Pin in my arm, for concentration
Please respond. This is an angelEmbed
