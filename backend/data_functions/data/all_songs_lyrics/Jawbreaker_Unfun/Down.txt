Down LyricsThis is the world
Everyone's standing by hesitating
So many people halfway there
Why are you waiting?
And all those things you thought you'd be
Between two points in the middle of nowhere
Did you know that it doesn't come free?
Have you seen yourself of late?
Have you really got your fill?
Standing still beside the kill
Never stop
At times your feet they seem to slide
Time to try for more than that
That's the wonder of the winner's cup
Never break your stride
Get up!
And if you slip you can get up
Put your foot down
Into the shaky ground
See the people lying down
Look around
Piss around a circle and make it sound
Can't you hear the sound of machines all breaking down
Listen now
The fuel is running out
The severed lines destroyed by too much time spent down
I come unwound
My head forced down
My hope forced down between my legs
All my preaching stems from fear
I hold you dear
You must break out of this old cage
You're my concern
This is no longer safe.Do it nowEmbed
