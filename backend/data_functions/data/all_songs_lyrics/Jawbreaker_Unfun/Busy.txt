Busy Lyrics(1st Verse)
When all the consoling places
Lose their charm and change their faces
The world becomes too cruel to bear
And something in you starts to tear
When nothing seems to be quite worth it
And sleep becomes the only sure thing
I'm here to help you out of it
Come and see me for a lift
(Chorus)
We're all close to the end
Don't you need a friend?
Honor your allegiances!
Everyone is drowning in sand
Couldn't you use a hand?
Please don't make me guess!
(2nd Verse)
When changes make the world a stranger
No one calls and your life's in danger
If the money's gone without a trace
And your longing for a familiar face
Cars collide and people die
You begin to shake 'til you start to cry
If disasters only start to multiply
My door is open drop on by
(Chorus)
We're all close to the end
Don't you need a friend?
Honor your allegiances!
Everyone is drowning in sand
Couldn't you use a hand?
Please don't make me guess!
Sad again you're sad again
Hey you're breaking down
Sad again you're sad again
Your eyes betray your new smile
(3rd Verse)
When keeping up is killing you
And you need a ruling without a clue
When being cool means being dead
And your better thoughts are better left unsaid
If you're sad to see your gun's unloaded
Tried to drown but you only floated
If the world is only getting colder
I'd like to offer you a dry shoulder
(Chorus)
We're all close to the end
Don't you need a friend?
Honor your allegiances!
Everyone is drowning in sand
Couldn't you use a hand?
Please don't make me guess!
Sad again you're sad again
Hey you're breaking down
Sad again you're sad again
Your eyes betray your new smile
Whoah!
