Fine Day LyricsIf I believed everything that you said
Then I'd never go I'd never go outside
And if you completely showed yourself to me
Then I'd never go I'd never go outside
Fine day if you're not me
Fine day to sleep
Fine day if you're not me
Fine day to sleep
If the sun came and it wouldn't go away
Then I'd never go I'd never go outside
I've got no time for your Sunday afternoons
And I'll never go I'll never go outside
Fine day if you're not me
Fine day to sleep
Fine day if you're not me
Fine day to sleep
Fine day, fine day, fine day...Embed
