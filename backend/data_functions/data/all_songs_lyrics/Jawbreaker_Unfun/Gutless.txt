Gutless LyricsSwallow your pride
But take it slow
You might just choke on it
And you wouldn't want to do a thing like that
What's left inside without your words
And fists to hold them up?
Can you look at it without rose colored lenses?
Doesn't speak too well of you
You crawl to pass their tests
I would like to help you but
I'm not sure who to address
There are so many of you
Used to be just one
Lost you to the other side
To promises of fun
Do you define yourself by some remembered set of empty phrases?
Do you question them at all?
Is what you do and what you say just following companions?
Do you do it from fear of not belonging?
Doesn't speak too well of you
You crawl to pass their tests
I would like to help you but
I'm not sure who to address
There are so many of you
Used to be just one
Lost you to the other side
To promises of fun
Just walk that line
Keep right on time
Don't fall behind
Don't fall behind
I don't condemn you
I know that we've all got to cling to something
To find our way through this life
Just look inside and see if your beliefs have any meaning
Or are they something that you found?
Doesn't speak too well of you
You crawl to pass their tests
I would like to help you but
I'm not sure who to address
There are so many of you
Used to be just one
Lost you to the other side
To promises of fun
Just walk that line
Keep right on time
Don't fall behind
Don't fall behindEmbed
