Get Up Lyrics
Wow!

Feel like throwing in the towel don't be a fool
They're out to knock you out, put you down for the count
Watch the left, watch the right, below the belt
They'll run you round and round it's plain to see
It's never gonna stop they'll run ya till you drop
There ain't no power around can keep a good man down

There's still some fight in me
That's how it'll always be
Hold your head up high, look 'em in the eye, never say die

Get up, and make it work, make it work
Get up (get up), and make it work

You say that love has got you down well that's bullshit
If love has got you down then love can pick you right back up
There ain't no power around can keep a good man down

Walking down a dead-end street
No mercy at your feet
They're holding all the cards, making things so hard, before it goes too far
Get up and make it work, make it work
Get up (get up), and make it work


Feel like throwin' in the towel?
Don't be a fool
Hey, they're out to knock you out n'
Keep you down for the count
Now, watch the left, watch the right, below the belt

Yeah, there's still some fight in me
That's how it'll always be
Hold your head up high, look 'em in the eye
Never say die!

Get up and make it work
Get up and make it work
Get up and make it work
Get up and make it workEmbed
