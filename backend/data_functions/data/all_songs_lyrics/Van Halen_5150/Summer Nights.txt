Summer Nights Lyrics
Ain't no way I'm stayin' home tonight
I'll be out until the mornin' light
Just hangin' 'round the local parking lot
Checkin' out all the girls see what they got
Yea they love it when me and the boys
Start playin' love with them human toys
Yea we just wind 'em up and let 'em go, oh yea

Summer nights and my radio
That's all we need baby don't cha know
We celebrate when the the gang's all here
Hot summer nights that's my time of the year

We made it through the cold
This freezin' snow is gettin' really old
Next year I'll head out for the coast
Say boys I think that might just call for a toast, yea
I got a line, you got a pole
I'll meet you down at the ole fishing hole
Yea them girls are biting good tonight
Oh yea, uh oh, oh yea

Summer nights and my radio
That's all we need baby don't cha know
We celebrate when the the gang's all here
Hot summer nights that's my time of the year
You wanna talk about love?
Well let's talk about love
On a hot summer night
The heat of the summer
Let's talk about love on a hot summer nightEmbed
