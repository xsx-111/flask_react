What About Me LyricsI have always had a real problem with getting down
But its alright you know, I really don’t mind that you know
I know you’ve been sleeping around
In beds full of idiots from town to town
But it’s alright you know, I really don’t mind that you know
Out of sight, it’s not right she said
Leave town right now and say wo-oh-oh-oh
Out of sight, it’s not right she said
Leave town right now and say wo-oh-oh-oh
And now back to the plot
I’m sorry I got side tracked there I’m badly planned
But it’s alright you know, I really don’t mind that you know
The words that they said sounded like they were underwater but I understand
But it’s alright you know, I really don’t mind that you know
Out of sight, it’s not right she said
Leave town right now and say wo-oh-oh-oh
Out of sight, it’s not right she said
Leave town right now and say wo-oh-oh-ohEmbed
