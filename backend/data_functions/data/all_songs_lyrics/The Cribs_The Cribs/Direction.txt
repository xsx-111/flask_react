Direction LyricsI may be leaving but it’s OK to say what you’re feeling
But baby not for free
It’s called direction
So many times I can see the way that you are is rubbing off on me
It’s called direction
Did you realise it’s not quite time
You look out the window the trains keep rolling by
It’s called direction
You’re still in but then comes the evening
It’s the best time of day ‘cos that’s when you’re on your own
It’s called direction
Finding you face down I heard you say
No one needs to know anyway
The reasons why we’re late
Finding you face down I heard you say
No one needs to know anyway
The things we did today
Holding on but is that right
You take me home but only on a night
It’s called direction
Don’t forget we’ll wait and see
They only ask because you are with me
Although we’ve got no direction
Finding you face down I heard you say
No one needs to know anyway
The reasons why we’re late
Finding you face down I heard you say
No one needs to know anyway
The things we did todayEmbed
