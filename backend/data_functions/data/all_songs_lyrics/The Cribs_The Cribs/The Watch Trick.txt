The Watch Trick LyricsAnd now, I know in my mind
It’s time to feel ‘round, ‘cos that is the best way to deal this I find
Oh I don’t know
Time goes so slow
And maybe it’s time to let go I don’t…
Now I know it’s not right
Now I must wake, I know I must take you home
How can I feel right when you are the one
That I like to see and be with on a night
And all that I ask
Don’t give yourself away too easy
Don’t give yourself to me
Now I know it’s not right
Now I must wake, I know I must take you home
Now I must take you home
Always I go alone
And if you’d like to, I’d like to die
But if you always insist
I will have to resist ‘cos
No-one likes that anywayEmbed
