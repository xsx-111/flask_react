Another Number LyricsI’m alone and I’m cold
Just another number on another row
I’m alone and I’m cold
Just another number on another row
And I never knew my name
I’m alone and I’m cold
Just another number on another row
I’m alone and I’m cold
Just another number on another row
I disappear for hours
Over the smallest things
I disappear for hours
And I never knew my nameEmbed
