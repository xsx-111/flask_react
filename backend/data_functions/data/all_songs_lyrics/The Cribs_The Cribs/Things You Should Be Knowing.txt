Things You Should Be Knowing LyricsIt’s been some time since I first met you
No one thinks about you more than I do
If you won’t let me find you, how am I gonna get through?
I was straight and acted like a fool
You were drunk and unbelievably cool
You won’t find a friend who knows you like I do
It’s time you should be going
But there’s no one home, I guess I’m alone
There’s things you should be knowing
But no one ever asked me before you
And you can know the rest if you want to
And every time they are together
They all crowd around to take a picture
Don’t you feel you have to
In fact I feel obliged to
If you won’t let me find you, how am I gonna get through?Embed
