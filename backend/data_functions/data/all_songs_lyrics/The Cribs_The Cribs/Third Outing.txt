Third Outing LyricsWhat’s the best thing about here?
It’s not the place it’s the people
But you wouldn’t know ‘cos your people are not us
It’s pretty funny what happened
And I wonder if you’ll remember the time we spent together?
And I wonder if you liked us all the time?
And I’ll move on to the next one
The next one is the wrong one
And I wonder what you see when you’re blind?
Outside it’s cold and it’s long
My favourite place so far is where I am
The best things in life are free but I’ve paid up
Because I forgot what it was I was on about
And I wonder if you’ll remember the time we spent together?
And I wonder if you’ll feel bad in time?
And you’ll always find a problem when I am locked in boredom
But that’s the way my life tends to be
"And here comes the riff we've already played many times
Here it is, one more time again in it's third outing"
And this is the endEmbed
