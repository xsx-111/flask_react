You Were Always The One LyricsI get the feeling they got you believing
It's better to be loved than left out
But it's like you told me
It's nothing to do with acceptance
It's all about escaping
Then you heard that there's always someone
Forget the wrong one
Disregard your past
But she came with feelings too complex to be amusing
You're gonna get trouble with that
You're gonna struggle with that
And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the one
I get the feeling they got you believing
It’s better to be loved than left out
But, yeah, like you told me
It’s nothing to do with acceptance it’s all about escaping
Know it’ll happen to me
I sentenced myself now a long long time ago
And I hope to be free but I guess that you’ve heard that before
So will you try and look surprised
When you find out I lied?
And I know I said I needed some time alone
And I know I never seem to pick up the phone
And though you will see me with someone else
You were always the oneEmbed
