The Lights Went Out LyricsWhy can’t I be like the one who ain’t over?
It’s over, get over
Thought it was alright to tease me, when no-one was around
And you tied me up and you broke my heart
And he said yeah, he heard every sound
It got really hot in the morning, so I went to blow me down
And you don’t know when the lights went out
But the lights are out now
Don’t know what you do but oh oh oh
Why can’t I be like the one who ain’t over?
It’s over, get over
I was supposed to connect some New York boys
But would have had to go way out of town
And there was no trust, couldn’t get the stuff
And you know what I think they hate me now
It got really hot in the morning, so I went to blow me down
And you don’t know when the lights went out
But the lights are out nowEmbed
