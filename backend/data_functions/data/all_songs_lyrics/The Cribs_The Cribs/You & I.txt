You & I LyricsYou and I, You and I
We should take the road less traveled
We should take the road less traveled
And we’ll die, we’ll die
You and I, You and I
We should always feel empowered
We should always feel empowered
And we’ll die, we’ll die
And when you’re feeling low
Let the feeling show
We all know what it’s like to be left behind
Yeah Yeah YeahEmbed
