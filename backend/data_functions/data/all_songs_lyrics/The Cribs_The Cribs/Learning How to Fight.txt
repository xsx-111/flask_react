Learning How to Fight LyricsAnd I’m learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
But I still can’t really tell you why I’m blue
And I’m learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
And the reasons, you’ll never really find
You took me out to breakfast
I guess that means I spent the night in your room
And I still don’t know what to do
And now I know I’ve got to do all these things without you
And though I don’t need my glue it still tells me what to do
And I’m learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
But I still can’t really tell you why I’m blue
And I’m learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
And the reasons, you’ll never really find
You took me out in the night too
I guess to see what I’d do?
And to be honest I didn’t really do anything at all
Because that’s what I’m like with you
And now I know you’ve gone home, back to wherever you came from
And all I’ve got is a song on a record I don’t even own
And I’m learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
But I still can’t really tell you about my blues
And I’m learning how to fight
Kissing you goodnight
And the reasons, you’ll never really findEmbed
