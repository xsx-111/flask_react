99 lbs. Lyrics
Twenty-five pounds of pure cane sugar
In each and every kiss
You would know what I'm talking about
If you ever had a love like this
I don't mean to be braggin', y'all
God knows it's a natural fact
Good things come small packages, yeah
You've got to agree with that
Well, well I said...

Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness, y'all
Ninety-nine pounds of soul
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness, y'all
Ninety-nine pounds of soul
Hey...


Twenty-five pounds of tenderness
You've got in each and every touch, yes
Twenty-five pounds of understanding my woman
I don't worry you much
Twenty-four pounds of something, y'all
Oh, That I can't explain
But in puttin' it all together, yeah
Ninety-nine pounds in a bad brown frame, yes
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness, y'all
Ninety-nine pounds of soul
Ninety-nine pounds of natural born goodness, yeah
Ninety-nine pounds of soul
Ninety-nine pounds
Hey Ninety-nine
Nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine
Ninety-nine pounds, yeah, I see you baby
