No Speak No Slave LyricsRooster crows at the break of dawn
A mother dies without her only son
A doctor laughs in the face of disease
I never once heard a creature say please
And you, you want to be heard
But we never understand a word
And you, you want to be free
Then don't speak like a slave to me
Policemen who break the laws
Politicians rise and fall
A baby crying for it's mothers milk
A daddy's secret hidden guilt
