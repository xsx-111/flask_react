Time Will Tell LyricsWritten by: B. Marley
JAH would never give the power to a baldhead
Run come crucify the dread
Time alone, oh! time will tell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Time alone, oh! time will tell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Back them up, oh not the brothers
But the ones, who set them up
Time alone, oh! time will tell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Time alone, oh! time will tell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Oh children weep no more
Oh my sycamore tree, saw the freedom tree
Saw you settle the score
Oh children weep no more
Weep no more, children weep no more
JAH would never give the power to a baldhead
Run come crucify the dread
Time alone, oh! time will tell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hell
Time alone, oh! time will tell
Think you're in heaven but you're living in hellEmbed
