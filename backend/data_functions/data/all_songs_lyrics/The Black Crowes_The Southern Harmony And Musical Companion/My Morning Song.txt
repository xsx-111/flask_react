My Morning Song Lyrics
Dizzy found me last night
I saw some kind of new light
Oooh, I woke up in a whirlwind
Hey, baby, just you watch my head spin
The spectacle that made you cry
It's a thrill-a-minute plane ride
It's over time at ring side, no lie

March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day
Make my haze blow away
Aw, make it blow away

I hide I seek, I go and I find
Truth in a fable faith in a rhyme
So why they want to bad talk me?
Are they surprised by what we see?
Like the tables and the tides turn
On my bed the emperor worn
Is that enough for me, could be

March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day
Make my haze blow away
Aw, make it blow away



If music got to free your mind
Just let it go, baby, let it go
'Cause you never know, you never know
Say, if your rhythm ever falls out of time
You can bring it to me and I promise I will make it fine, yes I will
And if your heart is beating free
For the very first time it'll be alright, yes it will, yes it will
If your soul is let go, oh baby, you never know
No you never know, you never know
If your rhythm ever falls out of time
You can bring it to me and I will, yes I will make it alright
Oh, there gonna be enough time baby
But you might try, you might try
Ooh, will you let it? Oh, yeah, will you let your soul go?
Let your mind go? Let your heart go? Let your soul go?
Will you let it? Oh yeah, oh yeah, I just wanna try
Aw, make it alright, make it alright, oh yeah!

March me down to the seven seas
Bury me with a ruby ring
Kiss me, baby, on an Easter Sunday day
Make my haze blow away
Aw, make it blow awayEmbed
