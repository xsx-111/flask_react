Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye Lyrics
With my winter time
My idols and stage fright
In another night
Where the lights are loud and bright

One dream from waking up saved
Too shy to hold in the rage

I know no luxury
Of knowing what your eyes read
I know one million ways
To always pick the wrong thing to say

A love that you never gave
Always a time zone away
No, it's not out of spite
Oh, I just know what's right
So that's why

Bad luck, blue eyes
Goodbye
Sometimes a memory
Only sees what it wants to believe
And what's filled in between
Are days and nights that don't mean a thing

It's such a simple suicide
A second chance never tried
Oh, why don't understand?
I need a helping hand
So that's why

Bad luck, blue eyes
Goodbye

So you think that you've seen it all, is that a fact?
So out your mouth a dictionary spouts about this and that
You got your do's, your don'ts, because and why
I don't trust no one who don't take their own advice

Bad luck, blue eyes
GoodbyeEmbed
