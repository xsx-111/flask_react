Sting Me (Slow) LyricsIf you feel like a riot, then don't you deny it
Put your good foot forward
No need for heroics I just want you to show it
Now's the time to shine
Your independence is a half ass deliverance
The train left the station
The recognition of the same old condition
Your symptoms showing through
Well regardless of the truth
You still act so aloof
In the face of your judge & jury
You have the nerve to say not guilty
But can you sting me
Can you sting me
Right to my rotten bones
Well the bells ring out for the crimes of the century
By courtesy of your mother
The signs reads welcome to the valley of discovery
Look at what money can buy
Sons & daughters better open your eyes
Tell me what you're seeing
This submission is a tired tradition
It's everyone's sacrifice
Well believe you me
I've got nothing up my sleeve
Except a heart and a chip on my shoulder
Yes I'm young and don't like getting older
Yeah but can you sting me
Can you sting me
Right to my rotten bones
Come on my sweet little thing
What new things can you show me today
I got one question
I believe it's subjective
What is a wasp without her sting?
I don't want to sound bitter
Yeah you touch me just like murder
Living ain't so easy
When all I want from you is to sting me
Can you sting meEmbed
