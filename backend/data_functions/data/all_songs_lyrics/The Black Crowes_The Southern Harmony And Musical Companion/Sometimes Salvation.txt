Sometimes Salvation Lyrics
To lessen my troubles
I stopped hanging out with vultures
And empty saviors like you
Oh, I wish I had a nickel
For every miracle
That you easily tricked me into

You can lead a horse to water
But faith is another matter
So don't you surrender
Cause sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm

I've no time for accusations
Or conversations
On all the bad, bad things you do
Just a note from the jailor
Drugs and the relations
To all the people around you

You can lead a horse to water
But faith is another matter
So don't you surrender
Cause sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm
I've kept secret your superstitions
And all its twisted wisdom
That I fell into

You can lead a horse to water
But faith is another matter
So don't you surrender
Cause sometimes salvation
In the eye of the storm

Sister can you try and find me?
Sister can you try and find me?
Sister can you try and find me?
Sister can you try and find me?Embed
