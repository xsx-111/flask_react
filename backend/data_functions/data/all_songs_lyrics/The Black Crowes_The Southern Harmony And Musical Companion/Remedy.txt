Remedy Lyrics
Baby, baby why can't you sit still?
Who killed that bird out on you window sill?
Are you the reason that he broke his back?
Tell me, did I see, you think I'd laugh about that? Alright!

If I come on like a dream
Will you let me show you what I mean?
Will you let me come on inside?
Ohh, will you let it glide?

Can I have some remedy?
(All I want is a remedy)
Remedy for me, please
(For all of the things I really do need)
If had some remedy
(oh, I'd take another one)
I'd take enough to please me (please me), yeah!

Say, baby, baby why you dye your hair?
Why you always keeping with your mother's dare?
So baby, why's who's who?, I said who knows you too?
Tell me, did the other children scold on you?
If I come on like a dream
Ohh, will you let me show you what I mean?
Will you let me come on inside
Ohh, will you let it slide?

Can I have some remedy?
(All I want is a remedy)
Remedy for me, please
(For all of the things I really do need)
If had some remedy
(I'd surely take another)
I'd take enough to please me (please me)


I need a remedy, huh, yeah
But what is havin' me?
Don't ya see?
Remedy, but what is havin' me?
Remedy, havin' me
Ooooh...If I only had a remedy
Say baby baby I want it
Say baby I need it
Gotta have it
Yeah gonna sing it, sing it, I believe it
I really want a
Remedy, remedy, remedy,remedy, remedy, remedy
Remedy, remedy
What I want? What I need
Can I have some remedy?
(Remedy)
Remedy for me, please
(Remedy)
If had some remedy
I'd take enough to please me (please me), yeah!2Embed
