Black Moon Creeping Lyrics
Sleeping eyes, sleep awhile
And let me get to know your language
If I believe all I see
I would hate to be around for the dawn
Sleeping eyes, stay the while
And give me some cause to rejoice
A parody, yes, of the scene
Where my three wishes were granted to me, hey

What you got buried in your backyard?
What secret do you sleep with when the black moon come?
Said, what you got buried in your backyard?
What secret do you sleep with when the black moon come?

Sleeping eyes, please come clean
I'm not giving you the third degree
When you live in no man's time
Ain't it hard to find some peace of mind?
Sleeping eyes, don't you cry
And don't pretend this is not an ending
Your history, yes, it seems
Has been swept out with the leaves
So what you got buried in your backyard?
What secret do you sleep with when the black moon come?
So what you got buried in your backyard?
What secret do you sleep with when the black moon come?
Yeah


Yeah, what you got buried in your backyard?
What secret do you sleep with when the black moon come?
Said, what you got—, oh, what you got—, what you got buried?
What you gonna do when the black moon—, black moon—, black moon come?

Tell me what you gonna do
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, tell me what you gonna do when the black moon come creeping on down on youEmbed
