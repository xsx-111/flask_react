Come On In My Kitchen (Take 2) LyricsMmm mmm mmm , mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mmm
You better come, in my kitchen
Babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
When a woman gets in trouble everybody throws her down
Lookin' for her good friend none can be found
You better come, in my kitchen
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
Ah, the woman I love took from my best friend
Some joker got lucky stole her back again
She better come, in my kitchen
Baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

Mama, can't you hear that wind howlin?
Oh, how the wind do howl?
You better come, in my kitchen
Babe, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
Woman I love, I pray to see
She's up the country, won't write to me
You better come, in my kitchen
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see
Some other man got my woman
Lonesome blues got me
Well she better come, in my kitchen
'Cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors
My Mama dead, Papa well's to be
Ain't got nobody to love and care for me
She better come on in this kitchen
'Cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoorsEmbed
