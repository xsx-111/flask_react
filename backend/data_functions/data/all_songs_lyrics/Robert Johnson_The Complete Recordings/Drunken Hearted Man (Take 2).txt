Drunken Hearted Man (Take 2) LyricsI'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery
I'm a poor drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery
And if I could only change my way of livin', it would mean so much to me
I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's home
I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's home
And I can't see the reason why, that I can't leave these no-good women's alone
My poor father died and left me, and my mother done the best that she could
My poor father died and left me, and my mother done the best that she could
Every man love that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no good
I'm the poor drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all
I'm a poor drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all
But the day you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that you surely fallEmbed
