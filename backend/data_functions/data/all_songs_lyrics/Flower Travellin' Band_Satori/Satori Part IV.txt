Satori Part IV LyricsFeel vibration, oh it's getting
Faster and faster, faster and faster
Loving is 
Crying and 
Through everything, carry on
Carry on, carry on
Things exploding in my head
 enjoy
Feel vibration, oh it's getting
Faster and faster, faster and faster
Feel vibration, oh it's getting
Faster and faster, faster and faster
Loving is 
Crying and 
Through everything, carry on
Carry on, carry on
Things exploding in my head
 enjoy
Feel vibration, oh it's getting
Faster and faster, faster and fasterEmbed
