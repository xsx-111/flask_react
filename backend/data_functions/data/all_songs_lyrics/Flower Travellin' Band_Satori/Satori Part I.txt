Satori Part I Lyrics
Under rough skies survey a day around
Charging through doors, going nowhere and everywhere
Just want to keep on moving and grooving
Sharing my trip with everything, with everything

Under rough skies survey a day around
Charging through doors, going nowhere and everywhere
Just want to keep on moving and grooving
Sharing my trip with everything, with everythingEmbed
