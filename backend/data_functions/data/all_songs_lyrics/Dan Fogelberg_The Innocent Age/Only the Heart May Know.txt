Only the Heart May Know LyricsSilent sea
Tell this to me:
Where are the children that we
Used to be
Silent sea:
At picture shows
Where nobody goes
And only the heart can see
Starry skies
Soft lullabies
Where do they go when their
Melodies die?
Starry skies:
To a day
Far, far away
That only the heart may know
Friends we knew
Follow us through
All of the days of our lives
Love we shared
Waits for us there
Where our wishes forever reside
Falling tears
Memories' mirrors
Where are summers
Oh, where are the years?
Carried far
To a wandering star
That only the heart may know
Friends we knew
Follow us through
All of the days of our lives
Love we shared
Waits for us there
Where our wishes forever reside
Starry skies
Soft lullabies
Where do they go when their
Melodies die?
To a day
Far, far away
That only the heart may knowEmbed
