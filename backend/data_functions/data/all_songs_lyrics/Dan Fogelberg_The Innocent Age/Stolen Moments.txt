Stolen Moments LyricsEvery time we speak
Our words betray intentions
Insincere inventions
That never quite reach the heart
So we turn the other cheek
And gather our defenses
Again, rebuild the fences
That just been keeping us apart
Waiting out the worst
We keep the best inside us
In hopes our hearts can't hide us
In hopes our tears don't show
And you know we're not the first
To try and breach the distance
And though we meet resistance
The love between us grows
And in the time it takes us
To look beyond the lies
We could be sailing through
Each other's eyes
And in those stolen moments
When love is caught off guard
We see it never had to be
This hard
Every time we speak
Our words betray intentions
Insincere inventions
That never quite reach the heart
So we turn the other cheek
And gather our defenses
Again, rebuild the fences
That just been keeping us apart
And in the time it takes us
To look beyond the lies
We could be sailing through
Each other's eyes
And in those stolen moments
When love is caught off guard
We see it never had to be
This hardEmbed
