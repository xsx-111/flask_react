Lost in the Sun LyricsEvery night I ask myself
That same old question: why?
And every day the answer
Seems more distant
I always knew the final
Truths lay just beneath the lies
But I never thought they'd
Be this hard to find...
I never thought they'd
Be this hard to find...
Every time I try to put
This puzzle into place
There always seems to be
A piece that's missing
And through the eyes of someone else
I look into my face
And can't believe the sorrow
There I see
I can't believe this lonely man
Is me...
The faster we run
The further away the dreams
That we chase become
And lost in the sun
Spinning and turning
Blind in the burning
Light of day --
We have to turn away
Every night I ask myself
That same old question: why?
And every day the answer
Seems more distant
I always knew the final
Truths lay just beneath the lies
But I never thought they'd
Be this hard to find...
I never thought they'd
Be this hard to find...
The faster we run
The further away the dreams
That we chase become
And lost in the sun
Spinning and turning
Blind in the burning
Light of day --
We have to turn awayEmbed
