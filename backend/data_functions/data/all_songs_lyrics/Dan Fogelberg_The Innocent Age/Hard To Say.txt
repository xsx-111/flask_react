Hard To Say LyricsLucky at love, well maybe so
There's still a lot of things you'll never know
Like why each time the sky begins to snow, you cry
You're faithful to her in your careless way
And so you miss her when she's far away
But every time you think you've got it straight, you fall
You face the future with a weary past
Those dreams you banked upon are fading fast
You know you love her, but it may not last, you fear
It's never easy and it's never clear
Who's to navigate and who's to steer
And so you flounder, drifting ever near the rocks
It's hard to say where love went wrong
It's hard to say just when (it's so hard to say)
It's hard to walk away from love
It may never come again
You do your best to keep your hand in play
And try to keep those lonesome blues at bay
You think you're winning but it's hard to say, sometimes
It's hard to say where love went wrong
It's hard to say just when (it's so hard to say)
It's hard to walk away from love
It may never come again
Lucky at love, well maybe so
There's still a lot of things you'll never know
Like why each time the sky begins to snow, you cry
Well, you cry
Ooh, you still have to cryEmbed
