Nexus LyricsAcross the vein of night
There cuts a path of searing light
Burning like a beacon
On the edges of our sight
At the point of total darkness
And the lights divine divide
A soul can let its shadow stretch
And land on either side --
Either side
And balanced on the precipice
The moment must reveal
Naked in the face of time
Our race within the wheel
As we hang beneath the heavens
And we hover over hell
Our hearts become the instruments
We learn to play so well
Wealthy the spirit that knows its
Own flight
Stealthy the hunter who slays
His own fright
Blessed the traveler who journeys
The length of the light
Outside the pull of gravity
Beyond the spectral veil
Within our careful reasoning
We search to no avail
For the constant in the chaos
For the fulcrum in the void
Following a destiny
Our steps cannot avoid
Across the vein of night
There cuts a path of searing light
Burning like a beacon
On the edges of our sight
At the point of total darkness
And the lights divine divide
A soul can let its shadow
Stretch and land on either side
Wealthy the spirit that knows its
Own flight
Stealthy the hunter who slays
His own fright
Blessed the traveler who journeys
The length of the light
In a spiral never-ending
Are we drawn towards the source
Spinning at the mercy of an
Unrelenting force
So we stare into the emptiness
And fall beneath the weight
Circling the Nexus in a
Fevered dance with fate --
Wealthy the spirit that knows its
Own flight
Stealthy the hunter who slays
His own fright
Blessed the traveler who journeys
The length of the lightEmbed
