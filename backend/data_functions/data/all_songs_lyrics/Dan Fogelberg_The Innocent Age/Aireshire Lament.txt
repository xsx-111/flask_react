Aireshire Lament Lyrics

Tell me a secret or tell me a lie
Tell me the truth if you have to
Say what you see fit but don't ask me why
Love never seems to last you

In times like these
It's hard to keep a man off his knees
In time like these
It's hard to keep a man off his knees

Over a barrel, under the spell
Money's the demon that drives you
Limping through heaven or running through hell
Happiness smiles but denies you


Nothing before you, nothing behind
Thoughtlessly chasing the thunder
Traveling lightly, traveling blind
Never detouring to wonder why
Tell me a secret or tell me a lie
Tell me the truth if you have to
Say what you see fit but don't ask me why
Love never seems to last you

Nothing before you, nothing behind
Thoughtlessly chasing the thunder
Traveling lightly, traveling blind
Never detouring to wonder whyEmbed
