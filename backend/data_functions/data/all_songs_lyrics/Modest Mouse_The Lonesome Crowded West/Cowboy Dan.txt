Cowboy Dan Lyrics
Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
And he's gonna start a war
He's gonna start a war
And he hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine but I want more"
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He goes to the desert, fires a rifle in the sky
And says, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He "didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately"

Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
No, no, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over

Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe
Standing in the tall grass
Thinking nothing
You know we need oxygen to breathe
Oxygen to breathe
Everytime you think you're walking, you're just moving the ground
Everytime you think you're talking, you're just moving your mouth
Everytime you think you're looking, you're just looking down
Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
And he hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor
And says, "I got mine but I want more"
'Cause Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
Goes to the desert, fires a rifle in the sky
And says, "God, if I have to die, you will have to die"
Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene
He goes to the reservation, drinks and gets mean
He "didn't move to the city, the city moved to me
And I want out desperately"

Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Can't do it, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
No, no, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over
Yeah, not even if sober
Can't get that engine turned over4Embed
