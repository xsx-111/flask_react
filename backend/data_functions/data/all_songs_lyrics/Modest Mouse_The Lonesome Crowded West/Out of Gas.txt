Out of Gas Lyrics
Out of gas, out of road
Out of car, I don't know how I'm gonna go and
I had a drink the other day
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away and
I had a drink the other day
I had a lot to say, and I said:

You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
You will come down, you'll come down, come down
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
Soon enough, you will come down, come down

Out of gas, out of road
Out of car, I don't know how I'm gonna go and
I had a drink the other day
Opinions were like kittens, I was giving them away and
I had a drink the other day
I had a lot to say, and I said:
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon
You will come down soon too
Soon enough, you will come down, come down
You will come down soon too
You will come down too soon

You'll come down, come down
You'll come down, come down1Embed
