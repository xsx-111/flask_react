Trailer Trash Lyrics
Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate, of course
You think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids, of course
They don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
Goddamn, I hope I can pass
High school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
Goddamn, I am such a jerk
I can't do anything

And I shout that you're all fakes (Fakes)
And you should've seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your bellyaches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I know that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you

Eating snowflakes with plastic forks
And a paper plate, of course
You think of everything
Short love with a long divorce
And a couple of kids, of course
They don't mean anything
Live in trailers with no class
Goddamn, I hope I can pass
High school means nothing
Taking heartache with hard work
Goddamn, I am such a jerk
I can't do anything
And I shout that you're all fakes (Fakes)
And you should've seen the look on your face
And I guess that's what it takes
When comparing your bellyaches
And it's been a long time
Which agrees with this watch of mine
And I guess that I miss you
And I'm sorry if I dissed you
