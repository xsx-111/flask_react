Shit Luck LyricsThis plane is definitely crashing
This boat is obviously sinking
This building's totally burning down
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my, and my, and my, and my
And my heart is slowly drying upEmbed
