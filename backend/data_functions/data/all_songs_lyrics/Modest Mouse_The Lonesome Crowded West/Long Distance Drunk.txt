Long Distance Drunk Lyrics
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
(Hang it up now or never)
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or doing or doing
Is making any sense

Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never (Hang it up now or never)
Oh yeah, yeah
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
Doesn't seem like anything you're saying or doing or doing
Is making any sense
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Oh yeah, oh yeah

(8 AM and someone calls you on the telephone)
Long distance drunk, long distance drunk
(You want to be by yourself and all alone)
Long distance drunk

Hang it up now or never
Hang it up now or never (Hang it up now or never)
Hang it up again
Hang it up again
Hang it up now or never
Hang it up again
It doesn't seem like anything you're saying or saying or doing
Is making any sense

Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Long distance drunk
Oh yeah, oh yeah1Embed
