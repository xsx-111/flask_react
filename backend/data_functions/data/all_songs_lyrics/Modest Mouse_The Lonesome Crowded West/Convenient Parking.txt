Convenient Parking Lyrics
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to others cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to make and store these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in your car with nothing?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store and sell, there's nothing

Convenient
Parking is way back, way back
Convenient (Convenient)
Parking is way back, way back (Park)
Convenient (Convenient)
Parking is way back, way back
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to others cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store these plastic rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in your car with nothing?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to make and store these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in your car with nothing?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store and sell, there's nothing

Convenient
Parking is way back, way back
Convenient
Parking is way back, way back
Convenient
Parking is way back, way back
Soon the chain reaction started in the parking lot
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to others cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities built to store and sell these rocks
Well, aren't you feeling real dirty sitting in the parking lot?
Waiting to bleed onto the big streets
That bleed out onto the highways
And off to other cities2Embed
