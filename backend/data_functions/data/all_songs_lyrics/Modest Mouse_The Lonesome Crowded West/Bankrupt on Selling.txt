Bankrupt on Selling LyricsWell all the Apostles, they're sitting in swings
Saying, "I'd sell off my Savior for a set of new rings
And some sandals with the style of straps
That cling best to the era"
So all of the businessers in their unlimited hell
Where they buy and they sell and they sell all their trash
To each other, but they're sick of it all
And they're bankrupt on selling
And all of the angels, they'd sell off your soul
For a set of new wings and anything gold
They remember the people they loved, their old friends
And I've seen through 'em all, seen through 'em all
Seen through most everything
All the people you knew were the actors
All the people you knew were the actors
Well, I'll go to college and I'll learn some big words
And I'll talk real loud, goddamn right I'll be heard
You'll remember the guy that said all those big words
He must've learned in college
And it took a long time till I came clean with myself
I come clean out of love with my lover
I still love her, loved her more
When she used to be sober and I was kinder8Embed
