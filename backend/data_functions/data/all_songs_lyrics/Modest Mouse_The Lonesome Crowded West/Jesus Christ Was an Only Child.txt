Jesus Christ Was an Only Child Lyrics
Well, Jesus Christ was an only child
He went down to the river and he drank and smiled
And his dad was oh-so-mad
Should have insured that planet before it crashed

Working real hard to make internet cash
Work your fingers to the bone sitting on your ass
I know now what I knew then
But I didn't know then what I know now
Penny found out as her hair was styled
You should hide your kids while the dogs run wild

Jesus Christ was an only child
He went down to the river and he drank and smiled
And his dad was oh-so-mad
Should have killed that little fucker before he even had

Well, Jesus Christ was an only child
He went down to the river and he drank and smiled
And his dad was oh-so-mad
Should have insured that planet before it crashed
Working real hard to make internet cash
Work your fingers to the bone sitting on your ass
Penny found out as her hair was styled
You should hide your kids while the dogs run wild
I know now what I knew then
But I didn't know then what I know now

Well, I know now what I knew then
Yeah, I know now what I knew then
Yeah, I know now what I knew then
But I didn't know then what I know nowEmbed
