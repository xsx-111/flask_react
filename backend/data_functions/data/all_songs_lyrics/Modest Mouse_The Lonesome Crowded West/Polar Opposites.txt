Polar Opposites Lyrics
Polar opposites don't push away
It's the same on the weekends as the rest of the days
And I know I should go but I will probably stay
And that's all you can do about some things

I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away

Two one-eyed dogs, they're looking at stereos
Hi-fi Gods try so hard to make their cars low to the ground
These vibrations oil its teeth
Primer gray is the color when you're done dying

I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to
Drink away the part of the day that I cannot sleep away
