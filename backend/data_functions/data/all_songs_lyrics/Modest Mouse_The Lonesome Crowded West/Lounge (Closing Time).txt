Lounge (Closing Time) Lyrics
She was going with a cinematographer
Everyone knew that he was really a pornographer
They went down to the dance and grind
And everybody was feeling fine
She was talking with a syllable lisp
And everybody she knew was gonna get the twist
And they all went down and did the porcupine
And everybody was feeling high

You are so hot
I would like to steal your digits
And I'm so hung up on it
I would like to move away from it
We are so caught up with things
We should pull each other's triggers
And I'm off

She was going with a cinematographer
Everyone knew that he was really a pornographer
They went down to the dance and grind
And everybody was feeling fine
She was talking with a syllable lisp
And everybody she knew was gonna get the twist
And they all went down and did the porcupine
And everybody was feeling high
(You thought you were smokin')
I've got a girlfriend out of the city
I know I like her, I think she is pretty
I've got a girlfriend out of the city
I know I like her, I think she is pretty
I've got a girlfriend out of the city
I know I like her, I think she is pretty
I've got a girlfriend out of the city
I know I like her, I think she is pretty


(Last call)
It's closing time, it's closing
It's closing time
It's closing time, it's closing
It's closing time
It's closing time
I'm on the road to God, don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart's the charcoal
I'm on the road to God, don't know
My brain's the burger and my heart is the charcoal
It's closing time
It's closing time3Embed
