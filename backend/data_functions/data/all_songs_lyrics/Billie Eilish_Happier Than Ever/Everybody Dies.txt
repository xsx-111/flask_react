Everybody Dies Lyrics
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone

"Everybody dies," that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone

I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about the world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies
And when will I?

You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown39Embed
