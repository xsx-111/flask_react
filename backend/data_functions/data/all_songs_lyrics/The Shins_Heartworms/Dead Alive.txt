Dead Alive Lyrics
Figments of imagination
"What are they hiding under there?"

On a walk in a fragile state
Weird angles coming over the wire
Back home we got girls in braids
And they're on roller skates and they roll any way they like
From my town I can always look down
Down my nose at the fish in the barrels
But in the wilds of human life
There are pretty knives, an array of gentle eyes

So tonight
Dance and cry
The dead alive

Monuments for awful events
I float by in a daze on the freeway
He can whine about different times
But me, I'm fine with the mirrors far away
For the mills in the valley to function
Rain gonna fall on the hills where we hide
Wash the blood and the guts to the ocean
Feed the pike, making everything alright
So tonight
Dance and cry
The dead alive

So tonight
Dance and cry
The dead alive

Figments
Figments of imagination
Figments of imagination (figments of imagination)
Figments of imagination
Figments of imagination
Figments of imagination
Figments of imagination
Figments of imagination
Figments of imagination
Figments of imagination
