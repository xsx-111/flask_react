So Now What Lyrics
I had this crazy idea
Somehow we'd coast to the end
Change lies in every direction
So now, I guess we'll just begin again

Oh girl, it's been a while
Since we met, out there in the cold
Seems so long ago
It's hard not to imagine
The lives we used to have
When the nights were ours alone
So now what?

I had this crazy idea
Somehow we'd coast to the end
Change lies in every direction
So now, I guess we'll just begin again
I think you know you're my best friend

It's sort of an unspoken rule
That things will not turn out the way you plan
You know that I
I can handle all of that
If I can still take your hand
Will you still think I'm strong
If I admit that I was wrong?
So now what?
I had this crazy idea
Somehow we'd coast to the end
Change lies in every direction
So now, I guess we'll just begin again
I hope you know you're my best friend

I had this crazy idea
Somehow we'd coast to the end
Change lies in every direction
So now, I guess we'll just begin again
I guess we'll just begin again
(I guess we'll just begin again)
I guess we'll just begin again
(I guess we'll just begin again)
I guess we'll just begin again
(I guess we'll just begin again)
I guess we'll just begin again
(I guess we'll just begin again)
I guess we'll just begin again
(I guess we'll just begin again)9Embed
