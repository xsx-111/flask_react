She Broke You So Softly LyricsWere you bored of the laughter
Were you tired of the pain
Is the bond now broken
Does nothing remain
Shoulder to shoulder
Like two stones in a bag
Did you rub one another
Until there was nothing yeah
Nothing but dust
And still you talk soft
So desperate and kind
So pure and so pointless
So helpless and blind
And is there no anger
Just pills for the pain
My friend you've been wasted
And you will be again
And you wait for a whirlwind
To unwind your soul
And you cry like a baby
You feel so alone
Cos she broke you so softly
You can't see the blame
Like a dog with a bone
You refuse to let go
Ans still you talk soft
So desperate and kind
So pure and so pointless
So helpless and blind
And still there's no anger
Just pills for the pain
My friend you've been wasted
And you will be againEmbed
