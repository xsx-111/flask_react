My Life in Art LyricsWendy gets high for the 2nd show
I watch her dance and I watch her flow
For a dollar
She dreams of Vegas and the desert strips
Where she can dance and she can make
A lot of money
She left her home in a pick-up truck
Left her husband when he beat her up
And now she works all night
But the Kansas wind won't freeze
Her heart
No, the rain just rolls right off her back
She's gonna be alright
Just tell me about the boulevards
Tell me about your life in art
Yeah tell me about the boulevards
Cos Europe always seemed so far
You look so young and you talk so old
Lighten up babe I might just take you
Home if you're lucky
You read some books and they
Broke your heart
But you don't know
One thing about life
You're just a pretty boy
And those bums on the corner will take your time
Sell you their stories for a nickel
And a dime
You could learn something
And she stares so hard at those neon lights
I swear to god she's gonna bust them up
She's gonna bust them up
Just tell me about the boulevards
Tell me about your life in art
Yeah tell me about the boulevards
Cos Europe always seemed so far
She laughs as she lights a cigarette
Throws her arms around my head
She says I'll kill you
I'll kill you just for trying (2x)
Cos you don't have the money, you don't have the money
Just buy me a drink and we'll call it quits
Tell me all about your pretty boy face (2x)Embed
