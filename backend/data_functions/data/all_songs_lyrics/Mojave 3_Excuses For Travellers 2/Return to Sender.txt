Return to Sender LyricsThe suns don't love me
And it's easy to cry
I send a letter
But I get no reply
Just a note
Return to sender
We talk on tiptoe
Everytime that we meet
But I think breaking up
Is just a conciet
Because Love turns sour
Every hour
I stand all day
With a rose in my teeth
Give it to the first girl
That will say something sweet
She says thank you for the flower
It will die within the hour
Return to sender
I went looking for a priest
I said say something please
I don't wanna live my life
All alone
HE said god will take care
Of those that help them
Selves
But you look pretty
Screwed, send a letter
And the word
On the street
Is that death is complete
When you think that
You know where you're going
And the headline in my mind says
Patience for the blind
If you find us
