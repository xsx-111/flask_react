In Love with a View LyricsI had a plan
That was built on thinking too long
Canadian winters
At home with your sisters
The romance was hard to ignore
You were beautiful
I was happy to fall
So happy to fall
I remember you searching
I thought you were searching
That's how I picked up the phone
Happy to hear you remembered the view
So glad to assume it was fate
I thought at the time it was clear
I thought at the time it was clear
So I stood at the station
With a plan and a pocket of poems
Heroically tragic
Bearded and blind with obsession
I'm a car without hope
Too close to the ditch to go far
I showed you my field
I said this is my field
But you weren't impressed
You said why are we here
Your motives arenâ€™t clear
In this room with a view
And so much of you
Is so far from here
It's so far from here
It's so far from here
It's so far from here
Oh my heart
It just fell apart
By the sound of your voice
And I wished I could show you
The same view
Of you by the window and me
Feeling fine
And me just feeling fine
Yeah me just feeling fineEmbed
