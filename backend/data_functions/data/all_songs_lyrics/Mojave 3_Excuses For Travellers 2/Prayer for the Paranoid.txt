Prayer for the Paranoid LyricsI'll send you a letter
From the front line
Please send applause
And some good advice
You were born with a compass
A map on your table
Tell me how did you find out
Your bearings were wrong
Just pray for us
Pray for sunshine
These days are cold
And I'm missing you
The city is no place to loose
Ah but I never thought
I could choose
It was plain from the start
Plain from the start
I was playing for time
I need laughter
And love
Some special drug
I need cigarettes
There's killers behind us
Devils ahead
Send protection
I will drown in this city
I will drown in this trench
Boilt for us
And the only thing left
Yeah the only thing left
Is the running
And these clouds keep on rolling
And I, I don't know why
Take this guitar out of my hands
I surrender
This town don't need drunkcards
Or singers of bad poetry
They need dancing and drugs and laughter
And we don't have them
Just pray for us
Pray for sunshine
These days are cold
And I'm missing you
This letter
Was meant for your eyes
Destroy it and then
Just go hide
You're the only thing left
That makes any sense
Please don't blow itEmbed
