Driving Lyrics
You're revvin' and drivin' through the night when those stars line up like they should
You've turned into what you've been through, but you used to be the good
Think of that old photograph, your mom in '89
Your dad laughed, said she was like that when she had herself too much wine
You'd give anything at all to be anywhere but here
Your breathin' only steadies when you start to disappear
You wanna be in mountains or smellin' water by the coast
But you can't get out of your own mind, so you settle in and coast

And you just drive to stay alive
One more day passes by
You just drive through the night
'Til that darkness turns to sky

You think about your sister and the mighty heart she has
She's been sober for a year now, how the time seems to pass
They told you it would go quick, but you never tend to listen
Don't you miss your mama-boy hummin' hymnals in the kitchen?

And you just drive to stay alive
One more day that passes by
You just drive through the night
'Til that darkness turns to sky
The concrete is the same here as it is in Rogers County
I bet those boys are doin' fine runnin' roads without me
Don't you miss the days when we'd sneak Jack in football games
No one in this town remembers my name anyways

So I just drive to stay alive
One more day that passes by
I just drive through the night
'Til that darkness turns to sky

You're revvin' and drivin' through the night when those stars line up like they should
You've turned into what you've been through, but you used to be the good1Embed
