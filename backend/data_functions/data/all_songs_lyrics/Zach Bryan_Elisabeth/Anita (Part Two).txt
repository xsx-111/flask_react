Anita (Part Two) Lyrics
Well the fire in your blood is showin' through your eyes
The evil in your bones is takin' it's time
And your head told your heart it had enough today
Anita's dead upstairs with the dreams on the way
And I remember you when you left this town
But sing of love and codeine with you around
You left hear and found the world was cold
Now you're in my arms and you'll never grow old

Anita, Anita, I don't wanna need ya
But I see you when its dark and I'm alone
Anita, Anita, I came upstairs to feed ya
They warned me about detoxing at home
You will always be the most gorgeous girl I know

I pray sweet girl you finally made it home
'Cause you left in a room with your dreams alone
If I've learned a thing about this life
It's that the evil only comes when you're tryin' to do right

Anita, Anita, I don't wanna need ya
But I see you when its dark and I'm alone
Anita, Anita, I came upstairs to feed ya
They warned me about detoxing at home
You will always be the most gorgeous girl I know
You came runnin' for help this time
But the world's never fair to the hopeful kind

Anita, Anita, I don't wanna need ya
But I see you when its dark and I'm alone
Anita, Anita, I came upstairs to feed ya
They warned me about detoxing at home
You will always be the most gorgeous girl I know

Well the fire in your blood is showin' through your eyes
The evil in your bones is takin' it's timeEmbed
