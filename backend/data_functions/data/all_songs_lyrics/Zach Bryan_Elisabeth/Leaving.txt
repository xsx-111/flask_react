Leaving LyricsVerse 1
It takes a hell of a heart to know what a
Heart really needs
And i'm finding out that love ain't what loves
Cut out to be
If I was not my mommas boy, I'd leave you
Crying in my car
Punch a hole in your damn dashboard and                                        forget the girl you are
We've been fighting for so long it'd be a                                             shame to let this go
But I'd rather let it lie than hurt a sweet
Girl I know
And its getting dark now so won't
You just stay
And I'll tell you that I love you till the
Leaving goes away
Till the leaving leaves this house
No we ain't going out
Till I make some promises I can't keep
And I wish I could explain how the toxins
In my brain get me so damn down
Sometimes I can't speak
And you'll try to understand why I
Can't be a better man
But it's hard when i'm yelling at you
In the street
But if leaving comes to staying
And you walk yourself away
Leave knowing that no one could
Love you more than me
I hope the world don't mind all the
Simple things I ask
Like a porch with good lighting and to
Hear my lady laugh
And I''ll act indifferent because I don't
Want to leave
Because leavings for a younger man that
I don't want to be
Till the leaving leaves this house
No we ain't going out
Till I make some promises I can't keep
And I wish I could explain how the toxins
In my brain get me so damn down
Sometimes I can't speak
And you'll try to understand why I
Can't be a better man
But it's hard when i'm yelling at you
In the street
But if leaving comes to staying
And you walk yourself away
Leave knowing that no one could
Love you more than me1Embed
