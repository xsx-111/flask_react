Washington Lilacs Lyrics
You look like you've been through hell
But came back clean on the other side
Oh, I know I didn't treat you well
But you'll be treated like a queen tonight

So darlin', won't you lie back
And just let an old flame warm you
I know I'm not the same me
And Lord knows you're not the old you
So babe just pack your things
And I swear that we won't come back
You're about as pretty as those
Washington Lilacs

I roll up with a killer in my hand
And I'll never claim to be
Better than I am
You look like a killer in that dress
So I guess my aim is to be your man

So darlin' won't you lie back
And just let an old flame warm you
I know I'm not the same me
And Lord knows you're not the old you
So babe just pack your things
And I swear that we won't come back
You're about as pretty as those
Washington Lilacs
So darlin' won't you lie down and
Let an old flame warm you
I know I'm not the same me
And Lord knows you're not the old you
So babe just pack your things
And I swear that we won't come back
You're about as pretty as those
