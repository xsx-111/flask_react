Come as You Are Lyrics
I've got some good friends with some loose ends that remind me of myself
They can drink as much as me and they can smoke me half to hell
And by the end of these songs when we bring our asses home
They'll all be thankin' God that they're not in this pain alone
And this world has been so cruel to me and it's been the same to them
But I don't mind sharin' my sweet depression
With some boys that act just like me and a girl that does the same
I don't know how I got here but I'm glad as hell I came

Come as you are, however broken
And we will see if we can make you whole again
Come as you are, with your heart wide open
Bridges that you've burned they are still there just floatin'

Remember us in our bright eyed days too young to go inside
Sittin' drunk on curbs tryin' to get us our selves rides
Of the pretty girls who walk down there on Elgin Avenue
Oklahoma sure is quiet but it has itself a view
And how am I supposed to know the good times that I'm in
If the good is only seen when I'm lookin' back at them
The boys are gettin' off work and they're haulin' on back home
If I am meant for anything it's to show you you're not alone
Come as you are, however broken
And we will see if we can make you whole again
Come as you are, with your heart wide open
Bridges that you've burned they are still there just floatin'

I've got some good friends with some loose ends that remind me of myself
They can drink as much as me and they can smoke me half to hell
And by the end of these songs when we bring our asses home
They'll all be thankin' God we're not in this pain alone

Come as you are, however broken
And we will see if we can make you whole again
Come as you are, with your heart wide open
Bridges that you've burned they are still there just floatin'Embed
