Revival LyricsGather round this table boys
Bring your shame I’ll lose my voice
Screaming at the gods about the bad we’ve done
Merle said mama tried but the prison still won
Your transgressions are mine as well
Anger grows in my bones if you could not tell
I’ll find comfort in company
Lord forgive us my boys and me

We’re having an all night revival
Someone call the women and someone steal the bible
For the sake of my survival
Baptize me in a bottle of Beam and put Johnny on the vinyl
Well the devil can scrap but the lord has won
And I'll talk to him on the rising sun
His son rose and mine did too
I was coming down now I’m talking now to you

We’re having an all night revival
Someone call the women and someone steal the bible
For the sake of my survival
Baptize me in a bottle of Beam and put Johnny on the vinylEmbed
