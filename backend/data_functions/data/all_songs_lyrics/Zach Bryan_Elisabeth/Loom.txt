Loom Lyrics
How do I make you fall in love with me?
And how would I let you know I care?
And how would I say that the man you're laying with
Is not the man that should be laying there?

How would a boy like me put it?
A man with some sense probably wouldn't
But I don't give a damn, I am not a smart man
I'm gonna say some words I shouldn't

And I had a dream I was falling
And maybe that's a fucked up metaphor
Maybe it just means when I meet you in my dreams
Nothing stops me from going through the floor

And I know all the bad things about you
But I still think you're the purest of our kind
I remember being younger with an awful pining hunger
For a good that a boy could never find
And a fear of a man so left behind

So I guess I'll just love you from the window
While you're dancing with the charmers in the room
And I'll sneak out that door like I have a time before
And just let that lost loving loom
And just let that lost loving loom
And how do I make you fall in love with me?
Is it lost in the emptiness of apathy?
Should I fight for it like war? Should I nail it down to boards?
Or do I live in a love I'm dying for?

And how do I make you fall in love with me?
And how do I let you know I care?
And how would I say that the man you're laying with
Is not the man that should be laying there?Embed
