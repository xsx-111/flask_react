Codeine Pills (Part One) Lyrics
Every time you come to town, we wind up doin' the same thing
Gettin' high and runnin' around, blame you tend on placing

I remember wakin' up with you, I wish you'd leave me layin'
Prayin' God'll get us through the bills we ain't been payin'
I hear a lot of people talk about you, I can't hear what they're sayin'
You're not used to stickin' around, grown accustomed to the stayin'

Every time you come to town, we wind up doin' the same thing
Gettin' high and runnin' around, the blame you tend on placin'
And are you happy now Anita now that you're finally free
When you said that you were leavin' and only comin' back for me

Cheap booze and codeine pills ain't worth all the losin'
Nothin' can come between us, damn a life worth choosin'
Cheap booze and codeine pills ain't worth all the losin'
Nothin' can come between us, damn a life worth choosin'

Daddy said I've lost mind and my momma she'd be grievin'
Your face down in a bathroom stall with vices planned on keepin'
Are you happy now Anita now that you're finally free
When you said that you were leavin' and only comin' back for me
Cheap booze and codeine pills ain't worth all the losin'
'Cause nothin' can come between us, damn a life worth choosin'
Cheap booze and codeine pills ain't worth all the losin'
Nothin' can come between us, damn a life worth choosin'

Every time you come to town, we wind up doin' the same thing
Gettin' high and running around, blame you tend on placin'Embed
