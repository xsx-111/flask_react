Cold Blooded LyricsWell you can call me when you wakeup
Your tears smeared from your makeup
And we are here in the wake of
A fire burning down our love
And I feel a filth now
I feel it deep within my bones
And I walk these city streets
Drunk and stumbling all alone
And I want so bad
To be next to you
But there's only so much two hearts can suffer through
And I think apart
May do us better
I'm glad it happened at all
Rather than never
But you're so cold blooded
Ooh my souls flooded
Water that's as cold as ice
You be my muse and I be your vice
And wouldn't it be something
If we could find the way
Somewhere in someplace and time
We could both be ok
I pray you're somewhere pretty
And that you're staying true
To that spitfire fireball drinking girl that I knew
But you're so cold blooded
Ooh my souls flooded
Water that's as cold as ice
You be my muse and I be your vice
I pray your somewhere pretty
And thats staying true
To that spitfire fireball drinking girl that I knew
But you're so cold blooded
Ooh my souls flooded
Water that's as cold as ice
You be my muse and I be your viceEmbed
