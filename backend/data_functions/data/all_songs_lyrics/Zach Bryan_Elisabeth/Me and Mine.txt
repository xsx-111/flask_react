Me and Mine Lyrics
Go ahead and make your money off a poor boy just like me
And I'll be pacin' in my room tonight tryna make some old scars bleed
Tryna write a plotline that you don't already know
'Bout the weekend crowd, or a reckless boy, or a girl from Ohio

They tell me I can sell my soul for a dream and a couple of shows
I don't think they understand how deep loyalty goes
For some boys I got in a barn we built out of pure Douglas fir
Badly written songs next to horses' shit is what an Okie boy prefers

Go on and tell me what you wanna
While me and mine, do what we’re gonna
You can keep your name and burn the cash
Tell 'em I died singin' in these hills if they ask

I feel I've lived a thousand lives just to get right where I am
Some hurtful words and some Pabst on ice turned a child into a man
We started this thing grinnin' boys, I think we've gotta run
The radio man came to fuck it up as he boasts about number ones

Go on and tell me what you wanna
As me and mine, do what we’re gonna
You can keep your name and burn the cash
Tell 'em I died singin' in these hills if they ask
Go ahead and make your money off a poor boy just like me
And I'll be pacin' in my room tonight tryna make some old scars bleed
Tryna write a plotline that you don't already know
'Bout the weekend crowd, or a reckless boy, or a girl from OhioEmbed
