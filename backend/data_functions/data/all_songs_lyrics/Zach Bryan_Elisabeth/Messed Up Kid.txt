Messed Up Kid Lyrics
Well I guess old men on the street prove that time really does fly
And I guess pawn shop diamond rings proves that girls love goodbyes
And I guess a black dress at a funeral means that life has one sting
And I guess a girl like you lovin' me must mean, angels love anything

’Cause I'm a messed up kid, nothin' to spare
I’ll turn a saint into a heathen with my hands goin' through your hair
I'm a messed up kid with nothin to show
Except a girl sayin' she'll be here everywhere I go
I'm a messed up kid

Well my old man says I'm wild and my mama says I'm reckless
And that color in your eyes reminds me of East Texas

’Cause I’m a messed up kid, nothin' to spare
I’ll turn a saint into a heathen with my hands goin' through your hair
Messed up kid with nothin to show
Except a girl sayin' she'll be here everywhere I go
I’m a messed up kid

And all this bullshit that I've been through
And all the hardships I've grown kin to
Could take me around, leave me feelin' down
But you pick me up every time
'Cause I'm a messed up kid, nothin' to spare
I'll turn a saint into a heathen with my hands goin' through your hair
I'm a messed up kid with nothin to show
Except a girl sayin' she'll be here everywhere I go
I'm a messed up kid

I'm a messed up kid, nothin' to spare
I'll turn a saint into a heathen with my hands goin' through your hair
Messed up kid

I guess old men on the street prove that time really does fly
And I guess pawn shop diamond rings proves that girls love goodbyes
I'm a messed up kidEmbed
