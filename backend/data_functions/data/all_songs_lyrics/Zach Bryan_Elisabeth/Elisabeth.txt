Elisabeth Lyrics
You ain't no shrinkin' violent, are you?
And you love to bat your eyelids, don't you?
You know all the times that I'm ashamed
And all those words you said, misspoken
To all the boys who left you broken
Ain't no need for placing any blame

'Cause if it wasn't for you cryin' there
In Ohio just last year
All the love I got would've been in vain
So I'll wake up for work
And tug a little on your shirt
Hope you know the depths I'd go would be insane

For a girl like you who needs trust but needs freedom
Who wants love but would be fine on her own
For a girl like you with your daddy's mannerisms
And a soft smile makes the distance less alone
In a world that's full of wanting what is next
I'll stay here with you, Elisabeth

You are here at just the right time
At twenty-three years, it's felt like a lifetime
My mama, she must trust you through and through
'Cause she left me with a girl like you
For a girl like you who needs trust but needs freedom
Who wants love but would be fine on her own
For a girl like you with her daddy's mannerisms
And a soft smile makes the distance less alone
In a world that's full of wanting what is next
I'll stay here with you, Elisabeth

You ain't no shrinkin' violet, are you?
And you love to bat your eyelids, don't you?
You know all the times that I'm ashamedEmbed
