Mine LyricsVerse 1:
There’s a fire burnin in the basement
That I’d only stoke for you
Freeze my whole life
If you felt warmth all the way through
You have given hope
Where hope is hard to find
Hate the man I am
But I’ll love him when you’re mine
Chorus:
When you are mine
Though I ain’t so angry
When you are mine
This world don't owe me a thing
Since you are mine
Oh the lord can take me
And I can die right now
With no qualms or questioning
Verse 2:
Well there were Pabst can
On the nightstand
Where you’re jewelry’s laying now
There’s times that made me anxious
But there’s beauty in finding out
How the good days come together
Like I always said they’d never
Back when I was younger
And the dark days kept me down
Chorus:
When you are mine
Though I ain’t so angry
When you are mine
This world don't owe me a thing
Since you are mine
Oh the lord can take me
And I can die right now
With no qualms or questioning
Verse 3:
Well there’s a fire burning in the basement
That’d I’d only stoke for you
Freeze my whole life
If you felt warmth all the way through
You have given hope
Where hope is hard to find
Hate the man I am
But I’ll love him when you’re mineEmbed
