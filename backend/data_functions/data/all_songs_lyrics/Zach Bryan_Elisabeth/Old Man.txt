Old Man Lyrics
I've heard all the stories of you back in your prime
How you held all your pride in hands stained
And you'd go to work for breadcrumbs and dirt
So your kids could stand tall in their name
And you'd told me
"Son, there are things to be done when you're older and stronger like me."
You give all you have just to be a good dad
And you'll die a thousand times just to please

'N old man the blood that you bled
And the mouths that you fed at your door
'N old man the sweat that you pour
Proves that they don't make em' you no more
'N old man the dinners you missed
So your daughters could eat at this table
'N old man I would give back all the things that you've lacked if I's able

I've never seen you smile like you did out in Pineville
When the crowd screamed the words of your kid
You told me
"Boy, it's been a long hard road in this life that I've chose for my kin
And I wish and, I pray I could go back in time, so I could raise up this family again."
'N  old man the blood that you bled
And the mouths that you fed at your door
'N old man the sweat that you pour
Proves that they don't make em' you no more
'N old man the dinners you missed
So your daughters could eat at this table
'N old man I would give back all the things that you've lacked if I's able

I've heard all the stories of you back in your prime
How you held all your pride in hands stainedEmbed
