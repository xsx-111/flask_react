Heading South (Album Version) Lyrics
Was a boy who was a dreamer and he flew so high and proud
In a world full of people out to cut his young ass down
No one ever understood a single word he said
And they cast him to the wolves when he wasn’t well and fed

But boys we’ve got a riser, a riser in our midst
And he will get the last laugh if it’s the last thing he did
And he used to roll around in that red dirt mud
But now he’s skipping town and that dreamer's out for blood

So don’t stop goin’, goin’ south
'Cause they’ll let you play your music real damn loud
Don’t stop headin’, headin’ south
'Cause they will understand the words that are pouring from your mouth

Then that boy, he called his daddy to tell him what he did
As the masses scream the lyrics of the messed up kid
And then he told that old man he was never coming back
To be cut down again in a town like that

Then he surely came to learn people come to watch you fall
But he's out to make a name and a fool out of them all
They’ll never understand, that boy and his kind
'Cause all they comprehend is a fuckin' dollar sign
So don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they’ll let you play your music real damn loud
Don’t stop headin’, headin’ south
'Cause they will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth

Don’t stop goin’, goin’ south
'Cause they’ll let you play your music real damn loud
Don’t stop headin’, headin’ south
They will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouthEmbed
