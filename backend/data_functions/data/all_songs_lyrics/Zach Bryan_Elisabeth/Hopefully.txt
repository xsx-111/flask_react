Hopefully Lyrics
I barely know if I'll be alive tomorrow
Let alone if the people I trust'll stay
So all I'll need while I'm breathin' is to be content this evenin'
Find hope in tomorrow either way
And I don't think those city girls are right for me
'Cause I don't fall for shallow pleasantries
And the conversation's nice but all the talkin' don't seem right
To a soul that prefers silence and the trees

'Cause I got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
So if you could find a why to forgive me
Then maybe I could find just a piece of peace of mind
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
Carry on tomorrow hopefully

And this world's expectin' so much from the man
That get's so wrecked on Saturdays that he can barely stand
And I swear to ride this bronco until the wheels and my heart don't go
It's not you're fault if they don't understand

'Cause I got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
So if you could find a why to forgive me
Then maybe I could find just a little peace of mind
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
And I went and talked to DeAnn at the bay
And she told me that everything just might be okay
I know you're jaded and you're faded and you're pissed off at the world
But you can only be the man you are today

'Cause I got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
So if you could find a why to forgive me
Then maybe I could find just a piece of peace of mind
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
And carry on tomorrow hopefullyEmbed
