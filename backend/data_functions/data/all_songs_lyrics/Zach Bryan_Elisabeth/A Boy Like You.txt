A Boy Like You Lyrics
Free, free

Don't try man, don't you dare
Keep her from living her life out there
'Cause she was meant for soaring and you were built for work
She likes the way that you smoke cigarettes
And you like the way that she never regrets
Holdin' onto you like no one ever has

If you were the darkness, then she'd be the sun
There's some things in life that you can not outrun
The fact that she was meant for so much more than you

A boy like you with your faded tattoos
Raspy voice and a shitty attitude
Motorcycle she likes holdin' tight to you on
A boy like you with your stories of shame
And all of the reasons she won't have your name
If you love that girl then you've got to set her free
Free, free

If you were the darkness then she'd be the sun
There's some things in life that you can not outrun
The fact that she was meant for so much more than you
A boy like you with your faded tattoos
Raspy voice and a shitty attitude
Motorcycle she likes holdin' tight to you on
A boy like you with your stories of shame
And all of the reasons she won't have your name
If you love that girl, then you've got to set her free
