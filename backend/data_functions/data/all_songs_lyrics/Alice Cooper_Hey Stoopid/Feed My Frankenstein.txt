Feed My Frankenstein Lyrics
Yes, yes, I know you're hungry
And here comes dinner
(Feed my Frankenstein)

Well, I ain't evil
I'm just good lookin'
Start a little fire
Baby, start cookin'
I'm a hungry man
But I don't want pizza
I'll blow down your house
And then I'm gonna eat ya
Bring you to a simmer
Right on time
Run my greasy fingers
Up your greasy spine

Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's feeding time
You don't want to talk
So baby, shut up
And let me drink the wine
From your fur tea cup
Velcro candy, sticky sweet
Make my tattoos
Melt in the heat
Well, I ain't no veggie
Like my flesh on the bone
Alive and lickin' on your
Ice cream cone

Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's feeding time

Baby whoa whoa, oh yeah
Feed my Frankenstein
Whoa whoa, baby chow down
Feed my Frankenstein
He's a psycho
Feed my Frankenstein
Meet my libido
(He's a psycho)
Feed my Frankenstein
Hungry for love
And it's lunch time
