Little by Little LyricsBlack leather gloves and your lipstick shines
Bright as moonlight glows
My wildest rose cuts so fine and deep
It hurts but never shows
You're bad, you're so hardcore
Pull me down here on the killing floor
Little by little we cross the line
Little by little the ties that bind
Little by little by little by little
Little by little tonight
Your sugar tongue speaks hot and sweet
Lying just for fun
Push and shove
Sex is sex
But honey, love is love
Were not sick insane
Just another lovers game
Little by little we cross the line
Little by little the ties that bind
Little by little by little by little
Little by little tonight
Im all undone
My pretty one
Dont slap my face
Unless you kiss me
Little by little we cross the line
Little by little the ties that bind
Little by little by little by little
Little by little tonight
You beg and you cry for more
You pull me down here on the killing floor
Little by little we cross the line
Little by little the ties that bind
Little by little by little by little
Little by little tonightEmbed
