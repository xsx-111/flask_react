Might as Well Be on Mars LyricsThe city streets are wet with rain tonight
Taxi drivers swerve from lane to lane
A lonely guitar man playin' down the hall
Midnight blues comin' through the walls
I tried to call you on the telephone
I left it off the hook
Just to hear it ring
You told me you were better off alone
I never knew that tears could sting
I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars
Lookin' down at all the cars
I can see you
In the window of your favorite corner bar
But to reach you is just too far
And I might as well be on Mars
The city seems so old and grey and beat
It closes in and makes me wanna suffocate
And you just live across the street
But that's a billion miles away
You've turned my world into a dark and lonely place
Like a planet lost in space, my light is fadin'
I'd cross the universe to be right where you are
But I'm right in your backyard
And I might as well be on Mars
I might as well be on Mars
You can't see me
I might as well be the Man on the Moon
You can't hear me
Oh, can you feel me so close
And yet so far
Baby, I might as well be on Mars
Baby, I can't fly
If I could I'd come down to ya
Maybe I should try
I'm on the roof and I'm starin' at the stars
Lookin' down at all the cars
I can see you
In the window of your favorite corner bar
But to reach you is just too far
And I might as well be on Mars
I might as well be on Mars
You can't see me
I might as well be the Man on the Moon
You can't hear me
Oh, can you feel me so close
And yet so far
Baby, I might as well be on Mars
And yet so far
Baby, I might as well be on Mars1Embed
