Die for You LyricsA hundred numbers on my wall
Some with names I sometimes call
I drop a coin and watch it fall
Tryin' to get connected to you
A thousand hours all alone
My softest pillow turns hard as stone
This is the longest night on my own
Lying here thinking of you
Sometimes I shake my head
And laugh to myself
I'd like to start again with somebody else
I'm like a broken toy forgotten on the shelf
Chorus:
Baby, I could have been someone
I could have been something
It would have been nothing to die for you
Baby, you're going to need me
You'd better believe me
It would have been easy to die for you
A million memories flood my brain
Drown my sorrow
Kill my pain
Whets my thirst for you again
Just another night to get thru
All my neighbours scream for quiet at my door
Shattered glass and torn up photos on the floor
Well, I couldn't stand to see your pictures anymore
Chorus
These cuts are deep but you plead innocent
Are you hell or are you heaven-sent
You're much to cold to know how much
You meant to me, yeah
A billion tear drops fallen from my eyes
But it's just a joke now
And I'm laughing at your lies
You made me hard as rock and now I realize
