Dirty Dreams LyricsWell, I wake up burnin in a soaking sweat
My pillows are drippin and the sheets are wet
I jump out of bed and I turn on the light
This happens to me every night
Sometimes you turn into a snake with long black hair
Then you turn into an angel, blonde and fair
You can turn yourself blue and I dont care
You can change your look
You can change your race
But its always your touch
And always your face
Chorus:
Dirty dreams
How you wanna do me
Dirty dreams
Let me get thru
Dirty dreams
A triple X-rated movie starring me and you
Well, I close my eyes
And you open your lips
Theres a shock from my head to my fingertips
I fall thru a hole cuz I can't get a grip
The room starts to spin and the world starts to turn
My heart catches fire and my bed starts to burn
Dirty dreams
How you wann do me
Dirty Dreams
Anything for you, babe
Dirty Dreams
Technicolor movie starring me and you
Make my dreams come true
Shake my nights
Rattle my sleep
Roll mye eyes, Im in too deep
