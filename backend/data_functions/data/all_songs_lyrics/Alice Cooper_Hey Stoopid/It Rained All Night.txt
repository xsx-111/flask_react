It Rained All Night LyricsI'm glad it rained all night
'Cause you would've been gone
I'm glad it rained all night, all night, all night
'Cause you would've been gone
I've been looking for love my whole life long
Searching for something to make me feel strong
I might be your lover, then I might be wrong
Yeah!
I lost it all that night
I felt my world go black
Lost my heart, my soul, my mind, my sight
Put a knife in my back
Let it rain!
Nasty dark clouds brewing over head
Oh, bring yourself in here
I'll give you shelter from the raging storm
You'll be so safe, I'm so sincere
I felt that pain all night
Since you've been gone
I know that pain all right, all-right, alright
Where you were gone
I've been searching for love to ease the pain
The hunger and the knife that's in this chain
Thank the thunder and the lightnin' for making it rain
I'm glad it rained all night
'Cause you would've been gone
I'm glad it rained all night, night, night, night, night, night
'Cause you would've been gone
You know I would've been gone
A thousand miles away
And I would've just left thru another day
You know you stop my heart, you make me shake
Don't you know that your an angle and my soul is at stake
I'm glad it rained all night, all night, all night
Or you would've been gone
You would've been real gone
You would've been on your way
You would've hit the night going 95 and I never gonna see you again
Oh, let it rain!
Oh, let it rain!
Come on, let it rain!
Lightning and thunder, great big storm
Come on babe, let me keep you warmEmbed
