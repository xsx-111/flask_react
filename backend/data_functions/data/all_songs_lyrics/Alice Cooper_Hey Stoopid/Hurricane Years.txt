Hurricane Years LyricsI got a ticket to to nowhere
Got no respect for the law
I got no use 'cause it's all abuse
It's the cutting edge of the saw
Ain't got no time for the future
Ain't got no time for the past
I'm running up a down escalator
I'm going nowhere fast
I'm hanging on like a spider
Blowing in the wind
This storm's gonna tear a hole
Right through this web I'm in

Thunder, lightning
The wind outside is so damn frightening
But it's alright, alright
Stand clear
You're living in the hurricane years
In the hurricane years
I've been through major destruction
I've seen through terrorists' eyes
Sometimes I feel no emotion
Sometimes I break down and cry
I need to walk on a wire
I need a layer of skin
I need a preacher breathing fire
To burn away my sins
And I can't help the victims
On the side of the road
And I can't stop the cyclone
That's about to explode

Yeah, blow!

Turn my eyes to heaven
Watching all the clouds roll by
I see the blood moon rising
I know I'm way too young to die

Oh, I got a ticket to to nowhere
Got no respect for the law
I got no use 'cause it's all abuse
It's the business end of the saw
In the hurricane years
We're living in the hurricane years
Oh, in the hurricane years
We're blowing in the hurricane yearsEmbed
