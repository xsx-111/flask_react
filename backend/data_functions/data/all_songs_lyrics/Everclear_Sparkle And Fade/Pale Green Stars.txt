Pale Green Stars LyricsAmanda is in love with the sight of the moon
She's got pale green stars in her room
Right above her bed
Put them on the ceiling
Leave on the light
When the sun goes down, then the stars might shine
Shining in the dark
Skinny little girl in her room alone
She's got hell to spare in her home
If you can call it a home
Doesn't want to be like anybody else
When no one is around, she talks to herself
I can hear her in the night
Hey, hey yeah
Hey, hey yeah
It's hard on a girl
When the blood won't come when it ought to come
It's hard on a girl
When you try to walk around on the shaky ground
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Hey, hey
Scared little girl watching Aladdin on TV
Amanda always cries when you yell at me
Yeah, please don't yell at me
Climb up all the stairs
Close the door
Doesn't want to hear us fighting anymore
Yeah, better call it a day
Hey, hey yeah
Hey, hey yeah
It's so hard on a young girl
She thinks it's her fault when it all goes wrong
It's hard on a grown man too
See my baby crying at the window, calling out my name
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Daddy's going away
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Hey, hey, daddy's going away
Hey, hey
She's got pale green stars in her room
She's got pale green stars in her room
She's got pale green stars in her room
She's got pale green stars in her roomEmbed
