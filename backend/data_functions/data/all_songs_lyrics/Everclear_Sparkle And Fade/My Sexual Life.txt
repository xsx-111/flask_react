My Sexual Life LyricsPeople you know try to tell you things
Bad things that you don't want to hear about
Tell you tomorrow what you did today
Just remember, it's a small town
It's a real small town
She gets tired of all the stupid boys
She can't wait until they're done
She wants a man who can take his time
She wants someone who can make her come
Yeah, can you make me come?
You always say you want a simple life
You and me both know that you are a liar
You always say you want a simple life
Hearin' you talk just makes me tired
Swim in the heavy water buried in the sand
Happy hearts fall from my shaky hands
I can't hide my sexual life
He always says he wants a special one
But you watch his head go spinnin' 'round
He really wants anyone who'd give it up
He seems to forget he's in a small town
You always say you never fuck around
You said this town is just plain full of liars
Yeah, you always say you never fuck around
Hey, hearin' you talk just makes me tired
Swimmin' in the heavy water buried in the sand
Happy hearts fall from my shaky hands
I can't hide my sexual life
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I can't hide my sexual life
Yeah, yeah
Swimmin' in the heavy water buried in sand
Happy hearts fall from my stupid hands
I can't hide my sexual life
My sexual life
My sexual life
My sexual life
My sexual lifeEmbed
