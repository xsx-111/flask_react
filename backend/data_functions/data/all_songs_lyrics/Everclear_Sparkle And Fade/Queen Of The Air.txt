Queen Of The Air LyricsThere is a dream I used to have
My dream swallowed me whole
There is a bridge where I hate to go
That is where I first saw her
High on the bridge
I seen her red hair shining
There is a girl I never knew
She was my Aunt Virginia
They said that she, she just disappeared
They said I look just like her
High on the bridge I seen her
Dancing, waving to me there
She smiled and raised her head
Then she took to the air
There is a dream I can't escape
My memories come back to me
There is a hell that I can't escape
My memories come back to me
I heard the truth about it
Pictures and headlines hidden away
I heard the truth about my real mom
Jumping from the bridge that day
Now I know why ever since I was three years old
Been having the same nightmare
Now I know the truth about Virginia
Why she took to the air1Embed
