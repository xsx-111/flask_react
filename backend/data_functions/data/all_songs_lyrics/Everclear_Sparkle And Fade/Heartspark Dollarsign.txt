Heartspark Dollarsign LyricsTime stops when the whispers blare
The voices drop hard, but the eyes still stare
The world resolves into a death's head grin
Because I walk with pride with a black girlfriend
My mom said not to bring her around
'Cause she's black, my family would put her down
I'll break the white-trash ties that bind
Trade a love so pure for a hate so blind
She said, she said
"Forget the fact that I don't look like you."
She said, she said
"You're possessed with a power bigger than the pain."
Time stops when we lie so close
In my room where we share what no one knows
From the day that we start until the day that we end
I know, I know, I know now
We will never find a place where we could just fit in
Me and my black girlfriend
She said, she said
"Fend for yourself. You're alone."
She said, she said
"You're possessed with a power bigger than the pain."
Oh, a power bigger than the pain
A power bigger than the pain
