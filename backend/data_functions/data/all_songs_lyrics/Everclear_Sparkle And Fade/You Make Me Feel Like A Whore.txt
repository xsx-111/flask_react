You Make Me Feel Like A Whore LyricsTake your word like it was gospel
I'm so eager to please
Yeah I like it when you talk to me
It feels so good inside your shadow
It's the place I need to be
Yeah you know I need to climb you like a tree
There is this place inside
Where all the good things die
Sometimes I feel like a whore
Sometimes I feel like a whore
I hate the way I am around you
I'm so nervous and weird
Sometimes I feel like I'm breathing underwater
You treat me like I am on fire
Like I'm something to eat
You make me hate what I see when I see me
Yeah, I dream of the day
When I learn how to make you pay
Someday I'll teach you to beg
Someday, someday
Yes I live for the day
When I can hear you say
You make me feel like a whore
Yes I dream of the time
When I can make you mine
Maybe then I'll feel half alive
More alive, so alive
There is this place inside
Where all the good things die
You make me feel like a whore
You make me feel like a whore
You make me feel like a whore
You make me feel like a whore
You make me feel like a whore
Yeah, you make me feel like a whore
You make me feel like a whore
Yeah, yeahEmbed
