Summerland LyricsLet's just drive your car
We can drive all day
Let's just get the hell away from here
For I am sick again
Just plain sick to death
Of the sound of my own voice
We can leave behind
Another wasted year
Let's get some cheap red wine
And just go flying
We can do the things
All the things you wanted to
No one cares about us anyway
We can do the things
All the things you wanted to
No one cares about us anyway
I think I lost my smile
I think you lost yours too
We have lost the power to make each other laugh
Let's just leave this place and go to Summerland
It's just a name on the map
It sounds like heaven to me
We can find a town
Be just how we want to be
No one here really cares about us anyway
We can find a place
Make it what we want to be
No one really gives a fuck about us anyway
We can live
Live just how we want to live
No one here really cares about us anyway
We can be
Everything we want to be
We can get lost in the fall, glimmer, sparkle and fade
The sparkle and fade
Fall, glimmer, sparkle and fade
Fall, glimmer, sparkle and fade
Fall, glimmer, sparkle and fade
Forget about our jobs at the record store
Forget about all the losers that we know
Forget about all the memories that keep you down
Forget about them
We can lose them in the sparkle and fade
Fade, fade, fade, fade
Fade, fade, fade, fade
Fade, fade, fade, fade
We can leave them behind
In the sparkle and fade
Yeah, sparkle and fade
Fall, glimmer, sparkle and fade
Fall, glimmer, sparkle and fade
Fall, glimmer, sparkle and fadeEmbed
