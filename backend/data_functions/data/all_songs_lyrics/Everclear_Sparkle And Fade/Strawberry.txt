Strawberry Lyrics
Naaaaah

Never been here
Never coming back
Never want to think about
The things that happened today
Want to lay down
On the warm ground
I think I'm going to need
A little time to myself

Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now
Don't fall down now
Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now
Don't fall down now... now...

I ask you for a slow ride
Going nowhere
You look like Satan
You ask me if I want to get high
Couple of bags
Down in old town
You tie your arm and
Ask me if I wanted to drive
Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now
Don't fall down now
Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now
Don't fall down now... now... now...

The last thing I recall
I was in the air
I woke up on the street
Crawling with my strawberry burns
Ten long years
In a straight line
They fall like water
Yes, I guess I fucked up again

Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now
Don't fall down now
You will never get up
Don't fall down now
(Don't fall down now)
Don't fall down now (Don't fall down now)
You will never get up (Don't fall down now)
Don't fall down now (Don't fall down now)
(Don't fall down now)
Don't fall down now (Don't fall down now)
You will never get up (Don't fall down now)
Don't fall down now... now... now... now...1Embed
