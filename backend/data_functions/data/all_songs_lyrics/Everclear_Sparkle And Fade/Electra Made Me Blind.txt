Electra Made Me Blind LyricsYeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Shake the dust from this small town
I turn and follow the western wind down
I go and pack up my shiny things
And go, yeah, just go
I find a new life in old L.A
Yeah, stupid happy with everything
I pulled myself down so easily
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, hey, hey
Met Electra when living down
I saw her spinning around and around
Never knew much about her past
I knew enough that I didn't ask
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
Living isn't a simple thing, I know
No one said it's supposed to be, I know
Living isn't a simple thing, I know
No one said it's supposed to be
I know
I know
No, living isn't a simple thing, I know
No one said it's supposed to be, I know
Living isn't a simple thing for me
I know ways to make it easier
I know
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, she lied
July, July, July
Living isn't a simple thing, I know
No one said it's supposed to be
Living isn't a simple thing for me
I know ways to make it easierEmbed
