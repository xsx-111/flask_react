Pride Of Man LyricsTurn around, go back down
Back the way you came
Can't you see that flash of fire
Ten times brighter then the day
And behold a mighty city
Broken in the dust again
Oh god, pride of man
Broken in the dust again
Turn around, go back down
Back the way you came
Babylon is laid to waste
Egypt's buried in her shame
Their mighty men are all beaten down
Their kings are fallin' in the ways
Oh god, pride of man
Broken in the dust again
Turn around, go back down
Back the way you came
Terror is on every sign
Though our leaders are dismayed
All those who place their faith in fire
In fire their fate shall be repaid
Oh god, pride of man
Broken in the dust again
Turn around, go back down
Back the way you came
And shout a warning to the nation
That the sword of god is raised
Get Babylon backed by its city
Rich in treasure, wide in fame
Oh god, pride of man
Broken in the dust again
Yeah!
Ahhhhhh
Ahhhhhh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh
And it shall cause your tower to fall
Make of you a pyre of flame
Oh, you who dwell on many waters
Rich in treasure, wide in fame
You bow unto your... your god of gold
Your pride of might shall be a shame
For only god can lead his people
Back unto the earth again
Oh god, pride of man
Broken in the dust again
Our holy mountain be restored
And mercy on the people
The people
Ahhhhhhh ahhhhEmbed
