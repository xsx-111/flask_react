Light Your Windows LyricsHold on girl, now don't be blue
Dry those tears for me and you
Can't you see our love is true when you remember
To do just what you say you'll do
Can't you see I live for you?
And I need you to trust me, too
Open your eyes
So the sun can shine lights in you
Will light on your windows
And change all your baby blues
To golden sparks that light your eyes
When you finally realize
That your fears were all just lies
So open those eyes
And let the sun shine lights in you
Light on your windows and take all your baby blues
To goldEmbed
