The Fool (live) LyricsCan you hear it in the morning, it sings the golden song
I saw his moving ever on the run, from and to the sound of one
Turning in, turning out, spirals high, never down
Wonder, wonder wanders, loving, loving lovers
Freefall, tumbling walls, one world, one one truth
If if it's above life is low, life is slow
Love is life, it's love, loveEmbed
