Stand By Me LyricsAnd I bring to you, darling, all my love
My hand to hold lest you fall my love
There are so many things, baby, that we could do
And so many ways, 'cause I love you, I love you
Those gray clouds make my baby blue
Oh, but soon those clouds will all fade from view
There are so many ways, baby, that we could be
And so many ways that I love you, won't you love me?
Stand by me, baby
Stand by me
Stand by me, baby
Stand by me, my love
Summertime is sure to come
And summer days bring the summer sun
There are so many days that are yet to be
And so many ways that I will love you to love me
So
Stand by me, baby
Stand by me
Stand by me, baby
Stand by me, my love
Stand...
Come on and stand by me
Stand by me, baby
Stand by me, my love
Stand by me, stand by me
Stand by me, stand by me now Stand by me, baby
Stand by me, my love
Stand...Embed
