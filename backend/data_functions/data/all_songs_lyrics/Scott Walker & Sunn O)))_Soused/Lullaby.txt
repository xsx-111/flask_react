Lullaby Lyrics
Tonight my assistant will pass
Among you
His cap will be empty
Hey non-e, non-e
The most intimate personal choices and requests
Central to your personal dignity
Will be sung
Hey non-e, non-e
Why don't minstrels go from house to house
Howling songs the way they used to?
In vain I bind another foot
In vain and now the other foot

Lullaby, la la
You can tell
My sweet little darling
My comfort and joy
Lullaby, la la
You can tell
In beauty surpassing
Are princes of Troy
Some are born to it
You can tell
Some are made to do it
Some allowed
When I lullaby, la la
Lullaby, la la
Tonight my assistant will hear
The canals of Mars
His cap will be empty
Hey non-e, non-e
The most intimate personal choices and requests
Central to your personal autonomy will be sung
Hey non-e, non-e
Why don't painters paint their cloudy spines
Chiaroscuro
The way they used to?
In vain I douse another lamp
In vain and now another lamp

Lullaby, la la
You can tell
My sweet little darling
My comfort and joy
Lullaby, la la
You can tell
In beauty surpassing
Are princes of Troy
Some are born to it
You can tell
Some are made to do it
Some allowed
When I lullaby, la la
Lullaby, la la
Tonight my assistant will pass
Among you
His cap will be empty
The most intimate personal choices and requests
Central to your personal dignity
Will be sungEmbed
