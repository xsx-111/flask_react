Bull Lyrics
Fire-ant necklace, bump the beaky!
Watch-garroted, bump the beaky!
Bliaut-besotted, bump the beaky!
Bump the beaky! Bump the beaky!
Woke nailed to cross, bump the beaky!
Could not give toss, bump the beaky!
Did not feel loss, bump the beaky!
Bump the beaky! Bump the beaky!

Miss the trees?
Won't miss the trees
Miss the bees?
Won't miss the bees
The leapin' like a river dancer's nuts
The stuttering like a tapir noshers' phuts
Miss the wind?
So?... No banners snapping
Miss the ashes?
We grabbed Wednesday
Miss the sun?
Welding skin to armour!?!
Red, then orange, then yellow
Then white
Red, then orange, then yellow
Then white
Quilt of corpses, bump the beaky!
Peal no pitch drop, bump the beaky!
Make the swab mop, bump the beaky!
Bump the beaky! Bump the beaky!
Sagebrush Saladen, bump the beaky!
Ramshorn punch-perm, bump the beaky!
Where no worm squirm, bump the beaky!
Bump the beaky! Bump the beaky!

Keep, movin' on
Keep, movin' on
Keep, movin' on
Keep, movin' on
Custodiunt migremus
Custodiunt migremus
Custodiunt migremus
Custodiunt migremus

Raris dolor, bump the beaky!
Inquietum dolor, bump the beaky!
Peccatrice dolor, bump the beaky!
Bump the beaky! Bump the beaky!
What if not her
Shove the moolight
Leave us nite-nite
Bump the beaky! Bump the beaky!
Bump the beaky!Embed
