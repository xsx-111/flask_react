Brando Lyrics
Ah, the wide Missouri
Dwellers on the bluff
Across the wide Missouri
Never enough
No, never enough

Whip-poor-will
Whip-poor-will
Scissoring high
In the trees

A beating would do me a world of good

Sneakin' by
Sneakin' by
I am down
On my knees

A beating would do me a world of good

I took it from Saxon
I took it from dad
From Fat Johnny Friendly
From 3 vigilantes
I took it for Wild One
And then for my sin
I took it from Lizbeth
Again and again
Ah, the wide Missouri
Dwellers on the bluff
Across the wide Missouri
Never enough
No, never enough

Whip-poor-will
Whip-poor-will
Scissoring high
In the trees

A beating would do me a world of good

Sneakin by
Sneakin by
I am down
On my knees

A beating would do me
A beating would do me1Embed
