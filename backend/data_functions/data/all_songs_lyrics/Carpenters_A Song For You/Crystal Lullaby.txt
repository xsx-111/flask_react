Crystal Lullaby LyricsListen to the song he sings
Can't you see his music brings her crystal sleep?
As her heavy eyelids fall
He's taking her to where the dolls rule the world
And in that land of make believe
Is where he'll leave her sleeping
Softly warm in a crystal lullaby
He's weaving her a paper castle
Where dancing clowns with tassels made of fur
Welcome her into their world
That lives inside the dreams of every little girl
She's guarded by a brave tin soldier
Sitting on her shoulder
Taken there in a crystal lullaby
Sometimes when I listen to
The velvet song that fills a summer afternoon
Something deep within me sighs
And wishes for the peaceful skies of long ago
That wrapped my cares in silver air
And carried them away
Leaving me and a crystal lullaby
That wrapped my cares in silver air
And carried them away
Leaving me and a crystal lullabyEmbed
