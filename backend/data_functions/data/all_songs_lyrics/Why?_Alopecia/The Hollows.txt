The Hollows Lyrics
As I lay me down to fall asleep
With my demons dying and my pilot light weak
I curse the last six months I've been hiding behind a mustache, yeah
And to those last 10 years, I've been howling a paper moon, well, fuck you

This goes out to all my underdone, other-tongued, lung-long frontmen
(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says)
And all us earth growths, some planted and some pulled
(Shut up and put your money where your mouth is)

You shine a flashlight in a hat box and spin
An empty oyster shell and celebrate the hollows

This goes out to dirty-dancing, cursing, back-masking, back-slidden pastor's kids
(From behind bars, it's not so hard to see He's risen)
And all us earth growths, some planted and some pulled
(Nobody finds God and then goes to prison)

In Berlin, I saw two men fuck
In the dark corner of a basketball court
Just a slight jingle of pocket change pulsing
In the tourist park I lost 50 euros
To a guy with the walnut shells and the marble
It really pissed me off, so I thought I'd go back
To get my money, but all my homies warned me
"Oh no, those gypsies prolly got knives"
This goes out to all my under-brewed, double-duped, two-time truth-fools
(Stop thinking a phone call or text is too complicated)
And all us earth growths, some planted and some pulled
(Like a married uncle at a family function)

I got them shaky gums and a couple of loose tooths
Now tell me what should I do?
My God, the clock's always
Stuck tellin' 11:11, at 3:32

This goes out to all my underdone, other-tongued, lung-long frontmen
(Even just Joanna Newsom's left hand)
And all us earth growths, some planted and some pulled
(I could beat the pants in bass off your best man)

This goes out to all my underdone, other-tongued, lung-long frontmen
(This is what the ghost of someone's dad says)
And all us earth growths doin' the croak like it ain't no joke

In a crowded room projected debonair aloof impermanence
He shrouded loosely in a heavy air of indeterminance2Embed
