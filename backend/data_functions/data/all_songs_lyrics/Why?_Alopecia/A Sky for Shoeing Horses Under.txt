A Sky for Shoeing Horses Under Lyrics
Rain goes perfect with a Nosdam mix tape
The last street lights stay on well after dawn
Kings fall to pawns he dropped the needle, let the song say it
The kind of morgue with a gong to tell you when
But the rooms rules bend and the staff will make you laugh
My dad wore this face in old photographs
Calico cats out stare me from behind a junkyard fence
High on khat I let my stare go soft but pretend it's not
When I'm eyed I tongue my bottom teeth
And look at the sidewalk in front of me
As my tennis shoes go in and out of the frame
Another sleuth-footed empty Why? walking on goose eggs in the mission
Swap meet brown 31 fishnet hat cocked to the right
I only played chess once in my life and I lost

Looks like a sky for shoeing horses under
Looks like a sky for shoeing horses under
Looks like a good sky to die underEmbed
