Fatalist Palmistry Lyrics
I sleep on my back cause it's good for the spine
And coffin rehearsal
I know a psychic who reads her own palms
And her findings are personal
She keeps her fists shut tight
And she sleeps on her side
Well, maybe she knows something I don't know

But I am still alive, in love and wide-eyed in my time
Not a mummy shrinking in its cloths
Your cat clawed out my eyes while I's distracted by your smile
And now my sockets sit like empty catcher's mitts waiting
And you ask me is there anybody else that I'm dating

Anna & Nathan
Anna & Nathan
Anna & Nathan
I'm patient
But your painted pony is fading
Lost like a snakeskin in high grass
And out there thrashing like a pet bird caught in a jet stream, that's me
Your count them blessings because your net worth oughta be less cream in your best dreams
But God put a song on my palm that you can't read
I'm lucky to be under
The same sky that held
The exhale from your first breath
Like a ring on a pillow of clouds
By you my tongue may stutter
But my gift heart screams clear and swells
To burst between the wrapped lengths
Of its bowed ribbon cell

But I am still alive, in love and wide-eyed in my time
Not a mummy shrinking in its cloths
There's a moth flock in my gut growin'
I tug at my groin like tides trying
To pull moon towards them
I can't ignore them
And when we say your name our tongues catch flame
And you wonder why we ain't got nothin' to say

Anna & Nathan
Anna & Nathan
Anna & Nathan
I'm patient
But your painted pony is fading
Lost like a snakeskin in high grass
And out there thrashing like a pet bird caught in a jet stream, that's me
Your count them blessings because your net worth oughta be less cream in your best dreams
But God put a song on my palm that you can't read
I'll be embalmed with it long before you'll see1Embed
