Song of the Sad Assassin Lyrics
We lifted the body from the water like a gown
You took off your bra to wrap the wound
Though the man was dead, and there was no need
Then your face turned red, when you said to me
I'll suck the marrow out
And rape your hollow bones Yoni

Alone putting three coins into a washing machine
Next to a caulked, cracked wall
In the basement on Fairmount Street

Putting three quarters into a washing machine
Next to a caulked cracked wall
In the basement
I feel like a loop of the last eight frames of film
Before a slow motion Lee Harvey Oswald
Gets shot in the gut and killed

Alone putting three coins into a washing machine
Next to a caulked, cracked wall
In the basement on Fairmount Street
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died
Billy the Kid, did what he did, and he died1Embed
