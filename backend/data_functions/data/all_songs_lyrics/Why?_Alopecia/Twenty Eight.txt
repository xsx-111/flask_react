Twenty Eight Lyrics
Twenty-eight

Tell me are you single yet
My heart's as big as texas
It'd take more than just a lingual threat
To get this pest to let live
At best he'll need a sedative
And strap him to a steady bed
At worst it's he's already dead
The first time folks have heard this
A song of these: the bone dry jokes
From the grown kid's spokesmen's notebooks
Lil pone go slow and hollow
Like an empty rowboat looks
Left to float alone it follows
Where any air goes, it's tookEmbed
