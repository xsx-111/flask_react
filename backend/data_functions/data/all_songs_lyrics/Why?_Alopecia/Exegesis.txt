Exegesis LyricsIf I really meant it, I'd embrace a dead pet
Or enter into a bet
That I could be hung high from a telephone wire
With no poor boy's pile of books under foot
No stack of yoga mats or foam-cored cushion pads
To lessen the pressure of the phone cord choking my neck
If I really meant it, I'd embrace a dead pet
Or enter into a bet
That I could be hung high from a telephone wire
With no poor boy's pile of books under foot
No stack of yoga mats or foam-cored cushion pads
To lessen the pressure of the phone cord choking my neck
If I really meant it, I'd embrace a dead pet
Or enter into a bet
That I could be hung high from a telephone wire
With no poor boy's pile of books under foot
No stack of yoga mats or foam-cored cushion pads
To lessen the pressure of the phone cord choking my neckEmbed
