The Darker Days of Me & Him Lyrics
Promises, promises
I'm feeling burned
You taught me a lesson
I didn't want to learn

Why did I come here?
Please tell me again
Why did you ask me?
Don't say you forget

I long for, I long for
I long for my home
I long for a land where
No man was ever known

With no neurosis
And no psychosis
No psychoanalysis
And no sadness

I'll pick up the pieces
And carry on somehow
Tape the broken parts together
Limp this love around
Limp this love around
Limp this love around
Limp this love around
Limp this love around
Limp this love around
Limp this love around
Limp this love around

Promises, promises
I'm feeling burned
You taught me a lesson
I didn't want to learn1Embed
