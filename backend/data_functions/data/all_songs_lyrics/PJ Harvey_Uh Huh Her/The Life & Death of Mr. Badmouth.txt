The Life & Death of Mr. Badmouth Lyrics
Baby, you got a, got a bad, bad mouth
Everything poison coming out, coming out
Cheating, lying since the day you were born
Someone ought to rinse it out with soap

Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out

No kind words are coming out of your mouth
Plenty goes in but nothing good comes out
Badmouth, sad mouth, you were an unhappy child
That doesn't make your lying tongue alright

Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out

'Cause everything is poison
You'll be the unhappy one
Your lips taste of poison
You're gonna be left alone

When you told me every word you said
Came from voices talking in your head
Well baby, I just think you're out for what you can get
Your badmouth has killed off everything we had
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out

'Cause your lips taste of poison
You'll be the unhappy one
Everything is poison
You'll be in the corner crying
Your lips taste of poison
You'll be the unhappy one
Your lips taste of poison
You're gonna be left aloneEmbed
