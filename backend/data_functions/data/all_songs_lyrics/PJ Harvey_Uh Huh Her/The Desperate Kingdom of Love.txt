The Desperate Kingdom of Love Lyrics
Oh love, you were a sickly child
And how the wind knocked you down
Put on your spurs, swagger around

In the desperate kingdom of love

Holy water cannot help you now
Your mysterious eyes will not help you
Selling your reason will not bring you through

The desperate kingdom of love

There's another who looks
From behind your eyes
I learn from you how to hide

From the desperate kingdom of love

And at the end of this burning world
You'll stand proud, face upheld
And I'll follow you, into Heaven or Hell
And I'll become as a girl
In the desperate kingdom of loveEmbed
