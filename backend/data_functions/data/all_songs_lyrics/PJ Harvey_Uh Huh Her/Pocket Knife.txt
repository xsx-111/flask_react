Pocket Knife Lyrics
Please don't make my wedding dress
I'm too young to marry yet
Can you see my pocket knife?
You can't make me be a wife

How the world just turns and turns
How does anybody learn?

Mummy, put your needle down
How did you feel when you were young?
'Cos I feel like I've just been born
Even though I'm getting on

How the world slips by so fast
How does anybody last?

As the world keeps coming
And the bees keep humming
And I'll keep running

Flowers I can do without
I don't want to be tied down
White material will stain
My pocket knife's got a shiny blade
I'm not trying to cause a fuss
I just want to make my own fuck-ups
I'm not trying to break your heart
I'm just trying not to fall apart1Embed
