Shame Lyrics
I don't need no rising moon
I don't need no ball and chain
I don't need anything but you
Such a shame, shame, shame

Shame, shame, shame
Shame is the shadow of love

You changed my life
We were as green as grass
And I was hypnotized
From the first until the last kiss of

Shame, shame, shame
Shame is the shadow of love

I'd jump for you into the fire
I'd jump for you into the flames
Tried to go forward with my life
But just feel shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame
Shame is the shadow of love

If you tell a lie
I still would take the blame
If you pass me by
It's such a shame, shame, shame1Embed
