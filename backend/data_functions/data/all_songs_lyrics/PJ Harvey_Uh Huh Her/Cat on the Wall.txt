Cat on the Wall Lyrics
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio

I heard our song on the radio
It wasn't long before I think of you
Can't get the sound out of my head
Don't look now, it's coming round again

I saved your voice from the telephone
I play it back on the message machine
It really sounds like you're having fun
I'm going out into the midday sun

Midday sun
Midday sun
Midday sun, oh
Midday sun
Midday sun
Midday sun
Midday, oh
Midday sun
Come night, I'm gonna step outside
Take a walk, I'm gonna clear my mind
The radio still playing our song
You got me jumping like a cat on the wall

Cat on the wall
Cat on the wall
Cat on the wall
Cat on the wall
Cat on the wall
Cat on the wall
Cat on the wall

Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio
Turn up the radio

They play the radio in my dreams
Takes me back to when I was 17
Dancin' in circles on the kitchen floor
I'll play this song till I can't take anymore
Take anymore
Take anymore
Turn up the radio
Take anymore
Take anymore
Turn up the radio
Take anymore
Take anymore
Turn up the radio
Take anymore
Take anymore
Turn up the radioEmbed
