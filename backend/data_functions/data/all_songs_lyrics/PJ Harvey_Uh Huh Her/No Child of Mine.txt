No Child of Mine Lyrics
I have no time for hate or love
Hey child, you're so full of woe
I have no time for hate or lying
Hey child, you're no child of mine

I have no time for hate or love
Hey child, you're so full of woe
I have no time for hate or lying
Hey child, you're no child of mine

Hey child, you're no child of mine
Hey child, you're no child of mine1Embed
