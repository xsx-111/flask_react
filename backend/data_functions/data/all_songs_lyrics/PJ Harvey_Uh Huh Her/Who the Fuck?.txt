Who the Fuck? LyricsWho the fuck do you think you are?
Get out of my hair
Who the fuck do you think you are
Coming round here?
Who the fuck? Who the fuck?
Who the fuck do you think you are?
Get your comb out of there
Combing out my hair
I'm not like other girls
You can't straighten my curls
I'm not like other girls
You can't straighten my curls
No!
Who the fuck you trying to be?
Get your dog away from me
What the fuck you doing in there?
Get your dirty fingers out of my hair
Who? Who? Who? Who?
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you!
I'm free, you'll see
I'm me, you'll see
Who? Who? Who? Who? Who?Embed
