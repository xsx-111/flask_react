Speed Heart LyricsI steal power from fantasy

Every guy I meet is such a cheater
And still I'm as fast as you
It's all the time of emotion
God, something that's so small
Can't you get off my street
I don't need your company
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
It's so, it's so...
A shelter from the pain
I don't really think I need you
What do you want from me?
You are so, you are so...Embed
