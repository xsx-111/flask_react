Blood One LyricsI don't owe you nothing
Nothing
Nada Nunca
Means nothing, never
I don't fit into your dumb words
Language is memory pushing through my skin
Bloody memory that filters everything
Blood is One
Hate is Two
My Pussy is Three, three
That makes you four
Peace, Love and Equality
Your terms
I don't fit into your fucking words
Your alphabet is spelled with my blood
Your alphabet is spilled with our blood
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
I don't understand
I don't understand
I don't owe you nothing
Nothing
I don't understandEmbed
