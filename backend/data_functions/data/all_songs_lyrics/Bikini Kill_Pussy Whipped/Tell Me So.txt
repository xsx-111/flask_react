Tell Me So LyricsTake out a piece of paper
Put your name up in the corner
Take out a piece of paper
Write everything down
Then you can read it back to me
And maybe you can hurt me
Yeah you can read it back to me
And maybe you could know something
About me
About me
If you are gonna look at me
I am gonna get a prize
Oh tell me so
I wanna know
Oh tell me so
I wanna know
And don't stall
Tell me now
Oh shower stall
And I fell down, down
Down down down
If you are gonna look at me
I am gonna get a prize
Oh tell me so1Embed
