Lil Red LyricsThese are me tits, yeah
And this is my ass
And these are my legs
Watch them walk fucking away
These are long nails to scratch out your eyes
You're not the victim
Though you like to make it that way
Pretty girls all gather 'round
To hear your side of things
Yeah, your side of things
Your sh-sh-sh-sh-shining path
These are my ruby red lips
The better to suck you dry
These are my long red nails
The better to scratch out your eyes
You're not the victim
Though you like to make it that way
Pretty girls all gather 'round
To hear your side of things
I am sorry we are so nice to you
Hand knife hand knife hand knife
Blah blah blah
All you ever do is
Take take
Take take take take
Take take take take take takeEmbed
