Alien She LyricsShe is me
I am her
She is me
I am her siamese twin connected at the cunt
Heart brain heart brain heart brain lung gut
I want to kill her
But I'm afraid it might kill me
Feminist
Dyke, whore
I'm so pretty alien
She wants me to go to the mall
She wants me
To put the pretty, pretty red lipstick on
She wants me to be like her
She wants me to be like her
I want to kill her
But I'm afraid it might kill me
Feminist
Dyke, whore
Pretty, pretty
Alien
And all I really wanted to know
Who was me and who is she
I guess I'll never knowEmbed
