Hamster Baby LyricsHello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Where is your next show?
Oh, in Honolulu
Where is your next show?
In Honolulu
Where is your next show?
Oh, in Honolulu
Where is your next show?
In Honolulu
Do we get to go there for free?
Do we get to go there for free?
Do we get to go there for free?
Oh yes we do
But not with you
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello
Where is your next show?
Oh, in Honolulu
Do we get to go there for free?
Do we get to go there for free?
Do we get to go there for free?
Oh yes we do
But not with you
Oh Everett True
Where are you?
Who is gonna put in our tape deck?
Who is gonna carry the bass amp?
Who is gonna buy us a van?
I could be you
I could be you
I could be you
It will come trueEmbed
