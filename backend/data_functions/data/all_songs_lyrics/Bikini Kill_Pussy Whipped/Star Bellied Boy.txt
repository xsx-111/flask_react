Star Bellied Boy LyricsHe said he wanted to
Just touch you
He said he wanted to
Just touch you
Star bellied boy
Different from the rest
You're so different from the rest
Prove you're different from the rest
You're no fucking different from the rest
And then he said "Why won't you fuck me"
And then he said "Do Me do me do me"
And then he said "I'll be your best friend"
And then I said:
"Why
Do
I
Cry
Every
Time
That
I
Cum?"
I can't I can't I can't I can't cum
I can't I can' I can't I can't cum
I can't I can't I can't I can't cum
I can't I can't I can't I can't cum
"Why?"Embed
