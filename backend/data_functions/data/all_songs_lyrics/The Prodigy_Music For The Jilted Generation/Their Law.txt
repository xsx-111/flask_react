Their Law Lyrics
What we're dealing with here is a total lack of respect for the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
Fuck 'em and their law
Crackdown at sundown
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
Fuck 'em and their law
Crackdown at sundown
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
I'm the law and you can't beat the law
Fuck 'em and their law2Embed
