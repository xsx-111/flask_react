Nature boy LyricsThere was a boy
A very strange
Enchanted boy
They say he wandered
Very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy
And sad of eye
But very wise was he
And then one day
A magic day
He passed my way
And while we spoke
Of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
"The greatest thing
You'll ever learn
Is just to love
And be loved in return"Embed
