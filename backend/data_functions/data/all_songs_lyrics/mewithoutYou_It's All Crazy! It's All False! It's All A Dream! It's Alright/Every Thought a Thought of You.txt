Every Thought a Thought of You Lyrics
Every thought a thought of You
No more thought, "I ought to do"
When nary a thing we see
Or touch we trust is true
Every thought a thought of You
Every look in search of You
No need for books
When we're with You
You wear a thin disguise
O, light within my brother's eyes
Every look in search of You

Da da da da da
Da da da da

Every song in praise of You
Our darkest nights are days to You
The trees raise branches high
Like arms in church to grateful sky
Every song in praise of You
No one here to believe but You
Everyone else is bound
To leave but You
They swear, their love is real
They mean, "I like the way you make me feel."
(No one here to believe but You)
There's no one here to believe but You
Da da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da da
Da da da da
