Allah, Allah, Allah LyricsIn everywhere we look
In everywhere we look
In everywhere we look
In everywhere we look
In everywhere we look
In everywhere we look
Allah, Allah, Allah
In everywhere we look
In everyone we meet
In everyone we meet
In everyone we meet
In everyone we meet
In everyone we meet
In everyone we meet
Allah, Allah, Allah
In everyone we meet
In every blade of grass
In every blade of grass
In every blade of grass
In every blade of grass
In every blade of grass
In every blade of grass
Allah, Allah, Allah
In every blade of grass
It doesn't matter what you done
It doesn't matter what you done
What effect is without a cause?
It doesn't matter what you done
Now lay your faithless head down
In necessity's cotton hand
There's a love that never changes
No matter what you done
If your old man did you wrong
If your old man did you wrong
If your old man did you wrong
Well maybe his old man did him wrong
If you care to sing forgiveness songs
Come down and join our band
We'll cut you like a sword
And sing forgiveness songs
(Don't worry, it'll heal just fine)
Everywhere we look
Everywhere we look
Everywhere we look
Everywhere we look
Everywhere we look
It's all crazy
It's all false
It's all a dream
It's alright
Everywhere we look
(Bring it back now one more time!)Embed
