Fig with a Bellyache Lyrics
The camel in the desert took a ship across the lake
While the fish in search of water found a fig with a bellyache
Who overheard the waves as they headed for the shore
"We're not so sure of separations anymore."
At the caterpillar picnic, brother butterfly stole
A rhubarb stem, licked and dipped it in the sugar bowl
Caught up for Massachusetts in a double-stacked train
Through the Adirondacks spinning like a weather vane
Gathering and cutting and splitting and stacking the wood
Our fuel is neatly piled and we all feel good

We pretend to care and like we understand
Our eyes go soft but know it now:
What we're thinking about is your mammary glands
And how to sail your birth canal
We found the pot that fit the lid
No less now then when we were smarter did
Our thoughts are like a tea bag on
The saucer, all the flavor gone

That dog below our waist aroused
When arms embraced the pretty gals
It came much more as a surprise
It happening when I hugged the guys
We planted for the final frost
We once were found and now we're lost
We got a heck of a lot to learn
About remaining taciturnEmbed
