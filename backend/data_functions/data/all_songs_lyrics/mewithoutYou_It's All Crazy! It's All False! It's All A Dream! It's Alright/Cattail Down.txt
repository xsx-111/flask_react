Cattail Down LyricsCattail down
The morning rail yard whistle blows
Cattail down
Our boxcar bound for... no one knows
After every hidden seed out
From it covering has been free
And every book has been discarded from the bookshelf
Cattail down
And the forgetting of myself
Cattail down
Replace the feathers in our vests
Cattail down
Surround the ivy
Thats gone to poison in my chest
"The parachute broke loose,"
Cried the goose with misplaced
But understandable concern
For his little brother's mental health
His happy little brother
And the forgetting of himself
Cattail down
Around the bulrush, the pollen shed
Cattail down
To dress my wounds
It left a bee sting in their stead
(Half an acre thoughts from out my head)
Headed east out of St. Paul
We stopped for water
Rested in the cemetery
Watched the Mississippi
Running out of food stamps
Found a bag along the footpath
Off highway 61 filled with
What looked like marijuana
(Don't worry mom, we left it there)
Hopped a grainrail out of Pig's Eye toward Milwaukee
A deer between the tower and the tracks
Saw right through us
Said, "You don't know where you came from
You don't know where you're going
You think you're you-
You don't know who you are
You're not you
You're everyone else."
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone else, you're everyone else
You're everyone elseEmbed
