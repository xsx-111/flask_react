Spinning the Wheel LyricsUh, uh
Spinning the wheel, Spinning the wheel, Spinning the wheel, Spinning the wheel
Five o'clock in the morning you ain't home
I can't help thinking that's strange
Baby I just want you to know I won't go through it again (yeah yeah)
Yes, those clouds are closing in
Baby love
And I will not accept this as a part of my life (Baby love)
I will not live in fear of what may be
And the lessons that Ive learned (Baby love)
I would rather be alone than watch you spinning that wheel for me
You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you getting what you want from me
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be (what we used to be)
You've got a thing about danger baby
I guess the hungry just can't see (can't see)
One of these days you gonna bring some home to me
Six o'clock in the morning you ain't phoned
I can't help thinking that's strange (yeah, yeah)
It seems that everybody takes their chances these days
Oh yeah, we're standing in the rain
Baby love
And I will not accept this as a part of my life (Baby love)
I will not live in fear of what may be (Baby love, oh oh oh)
And the lessons that I learned
I would rather be alone than watch you spinning, spinning that wheel for me
You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you getting what you want from me (baby don't you love that trash)
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be (I know you're always chasing that ass like it's going out of fashion baby)
You've got a thing about danger baby
I guess the hungry just can't see (just can't see)
One of these days you gonna bring some home to me
(Baby love)
How can you love me?
When you are playin' with my life?
(Save me love)
You say, give me time and I'll do better, I swear
Give me time and I'll lead you back to despair
You've got a thing about danger
Ain't you getting what you want from me?
(And I don't wanna go back there)
You've got a thing about strangers
Baby that's what we used to be?
(I don't wanna go back there)
You've got a thing about danger baby
I guess the hungry just can't see
(Never going back to that, that's a fact, baby)
One of these days you're gonna bring some home to me
To me
To me
