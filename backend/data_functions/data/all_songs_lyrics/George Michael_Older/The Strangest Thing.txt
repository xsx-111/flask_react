The Strangest Thing Lyrics
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la

Take my life
Time has been twisting the knife
I don't recognise
People I care for
Take my dreams
Childish and weak at the seams
Please don't analyse
Please just be there for me

The things that I know
Nobody told me
The seeds that are sown
They still control me

There's a liar in my head
There's a thief upon my bed
And the strangest thing
Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la

Take my hand
Lead me to some peaceful land
That I cannot find
Inside my head
Wake me with love
It's all I need
But in all this time
Still no one said

If I had not asked
Would you have told me?
If you call this love
Why don't you hold me?

There's a liar in my head
There's a thief upon my bed
And the strangest thing
Is I cannot seem to get my eyes open
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la

Give me something I can hold
Give me something to believe in
I am frightened for my soul
Please, please
Make love to me, send love through me
Heal me with your crime
The only one who ever knew me
We've wasted so much time
So much time
So much time

La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
