Star People LyricsMaybe your mama gave you up, boy
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
Star people
Counting your money until your soul turns green
Star people
Counting the cost of your desire to be seen
I do not count myself among you
I may be living in a dream
It's just there seems so many of you
Can't help but hope there's a difference between...
You and me
(You're a star)
I'm talking to you
And you should go far (you're a star)
I said, maybe your mama gave you up, boy
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
(Say, how much is enough?)
Star people
Never forget you're secret's safe with me
Just look at all the wonderful people
Trying to forget they had to pay for what you see
It's a dream
With a nightmare stuck in the middle
But listen, brother, where would you be
Without all this attention?
You'd die, I'd die, we'd die
Wouldn't we?
Well wouldn't we?
(You're a star)
I'm talking to you
I'm talking to you
(you're a star)

I said, maybe your mama gave you up, boy
(It's the same old same old)
Maybe your daddy didn't love you enough, girl
(How much is enough)
You only wanted them to love you
You may have been living in a dream
And as the demons tower above you
You bite your tongue when you really wanna scream
(How much is enough?)
Look at me
I said
Talk about your mother
Talk about your father
Talk about the people who have made you what you are
Talk about your teacher
The bully boy who beat you
Talk about the people who have paid for that new sports car
You're a big, big, big, big star
Look at you
(How much is enough?)
How much is enough?
Did you get off on a bad foot, baby?
Do you have a little tale to tell?
Did you get off on a bad foot?
Bad, bad foot?
Is that why you're a star?
Is that what makes a star?
(How much is enough)
How much is enough?
(Did you get off on a bad foot, baby?
Do you have a little tale to tell?
How much is enough?)
How much is enough?
Babe
Now, nothing comes from nothing, baby
That fame and fortune's heaven sent
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling
'Cause you can pay the rent?
How much is enough?Embed
