Kings Season LyricsThere's a season, for the kings, to lead
We're watching, watching
The revolution, those screams
Time is running, running
The revolution, those screams
And we're waiting, waiting
Is it the very end, of something
Or is it just, the beginning
Beef is at the front door
I got power, go to war
We need money, soldiers
So I'll lay 'em down, kill the poor
Tyrants want the greedy whore
Shake 'em down, gimme more
The rich they paid protection plays the underscore
Give me yours
Live on tour, the screams and wars
The private lives are at the core
Visions soar in my mind
All seeing I was blind
Blocking out the sunshine
Eternally, we be fine, globally
We decline anytime we mistreat
Murder everywhere we turn
Birth of a nation
Slaves on plantations
Traps keep us facin'
Distracted, rat-racin'
Poisonous, we taste it
Uncover truth, let's face it
I'll be in the basement
Rallying for placement
Changing lives is basic
The future's now don't waste it
Get up out the matrix
Is it the last time
We talk together
The last time
We watch each other
The revolution those screams
Time is running, running
The revolution those screams
And we're waiting, waiting
Kings season
Retreating slowly
Kings season
Watching scream rising
Is it the very end of something
Or is it just, the beginning
Watch it burning
Watch them falling
Watch it burning
I'll be in the basement
Rallying for placement
Changing lives is basic
The future's now don't waste it
Get up out the matrixEmbed
