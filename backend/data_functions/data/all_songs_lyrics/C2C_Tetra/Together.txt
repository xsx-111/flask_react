Together Lyrics
All I want is
You to get up
(Get up now)
All I want
Is us, together
(Together now)
All I want is
You to get up
(Get up now)
All I want
Is us, together
(Together now)
Uh, together now
Uh, together apart
Apart together we are
From growing up and having dreams of being a star
To traveling the world 24/7 is hard
Sad, used to be tighter than strings on a guitar
Now phone calls, G-chats, skype messages
Long distance love got us both like hostages
Without the randsom note, hard to advance you know
Asking, 'Are you coming home?'
And the answer is no, no, no
Maybe I coulda, woulda, shoulda
Taken a little time to explain that things are better
And very soon you and I'll be back together, uh
Ready as ever to face the stormy weather
Until then, here's a little something for you
Over this ill street blues, that my peoples produce
The type of sound, that will tickle your fancy
Reminds me of this old classic high life tune
By kudyu inky
Bet you my letter, uh, there's nothing better
I switch it up, you know it's never the same
Can't wait to be together again, I'm saying, I'm saying

Uh, together now
Together apart, apart together we are
Maybe I coulda, woulda, shoulda
You and I'll be back together
Here's a little something for you
Together uh
You and I
Together now
You and I together now
You and I together nowEmbed
