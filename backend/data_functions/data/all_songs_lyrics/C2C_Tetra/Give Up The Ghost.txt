Give Up The Ghost LyricsGive up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the gho-oh-ost
I'm sorry if I didn't match your wishes
Maybe if we sleep on it tonight
There's a chance that when we wake up in the monring
We'll see it clearly in another light
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the gho-oh-ost
Give up the gho-oh-ost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the ghost
Give up the gho-oh-ost1Embed
