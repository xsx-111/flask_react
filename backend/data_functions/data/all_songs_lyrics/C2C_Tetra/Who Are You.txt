Who Are You Lyrics
La, la la la la la la, la la la, la
La, la la la la la la, la la la, la
La

I feel like a pin on the map
In the middle, of spaghetti road
I know there's a light at the end
But the tunnel, it seems so narrow
Tryin' to find my way, but my shoes is feelin' heavy
They say I'm always dragging my feet
Now the world is measured on how fast you can get it
So I'm left behind before I can reach
Before I can reach, yeah

Makin' a life for yourself, is getting harder every day
Who are you
Pressure to find the cuffs and dollar, said they're trying to find a way
Who are you
Life ain't as long as you think, spend it wise while you're awake
Who are you
Time ain't a father to you, but it will never be the same
Who are you
La, la la la la la la, la la la, la
Who are you
La, la la la la la la, la la la, la
La
Surrounded, always takin' part in the habitation of your soul
But just 'cause you like the way it looks
Don't mean it's gonna suit ya, don't mean it's gonna suit ya
No it's not composure, and I'm not in a hurry
Could you say that in the fluke in his time
Before you even blink the day is turnin' night
And the ball will drop the thirteenth time
Still you're wondering why-ah, yeah, yeah
I'm making a move, while time overbears the rules
No cannot be staggered in steller my never is hella tight
Glitch's fingers close the gumbo
Composed of faith in all the things I've seen
Change the flavor of successful things
Gotta be more than a dream, I know
Sometimes I can be slower than the rest of the pack
But rest assured no matter how much I fall I never refrain
Get back on the bike, peddling harder, generate light
Want to be soft, flavor the world
Be an example to all of the boys and girls, 'cause

Makin' a life for yourself, is getting harder every day
Pressure to find the cuffs and dollar, said they're trying to find a way
Who you are
Life ain't as long as you think, spend it wise while you're awake
Who you are
Time ain't a father to you, but it will never, never, never
Who are you
Where there is blood there is life, easy to find out who you are
Where there is blood there is life, easy to find out who you are
Ah-Are, Ah-Are, Are
Makin' a life for yourself, is getting harder every day
Pressure to find the cuffs and dollar, said they're trying, trying, trying
Life ain't as long as you think, spend it wise while you're awake
Time ain't a father to you, but it will never, never, neverEmbed
