Because of You LyricsYeah
Uh, uh

Because of you, I'm never alone
I walked on the streets, and I peaked on my own
Because of you, the day was brighter
The clouds ride away and you're lifting me higher
Okay, okay, okay
Poppin' like you'll never know
Hoppin' on the train to go
Wherever, whenever
Things is fallin' in line like dominos
Typin' like I'm Kerouac
Know exactly where I'm at
Found my purpose in the surface
Of bona fide brainiac
Hittin' it in is no problem
Spit in the pan is hot lava
Let us again, there's no need to pretend
I let go and it turns out awesome
Being without you ain't workin'
Gotta be together, and that's for certain
Grab my hand, get in the van, and close the curtain
 x2
O—Okay, come on now
Good, good
Good, good
Ah, good, good
Good, mmm
Good, good
Good, good
Ah, good, good
Uh
I think I fell in love
She fell for dirty dub
I'm used to drinkin' with the boys
And makin' noise in clubs
And now we push and shove
Hope she don't walk away
Here come the clouds I think I smell rain
There's no turning back from here
Can't you see we're almost there?
Travel miles across the sea
All to find the road to me
Oh my love, my love don't go
Nothing's out there, you should know
Hit the bottom without you
To finally know it's true
 x2
Liftin' me higher
Li—Liftin' me higher
Lift—Liftin' me higher
Lift—Liftin' me higher
Liftin' me higher
Lift—Liftin' me higher
Liftin' me higher
Lift—Liftin' me higher
H—H—Higher now
Liftin' me higher
Lift—Liftin' me higher
(Because of you)
Lift—Liftin' me higher
Lift—Liftin' me higher
(Because of you)
Lift—Liftin' me higher
Lift—Liftin' me higher
(Because of you)
Lift—Liftin' me higher
Lift—Liftin' me higher now
I think I fell in love
She fell for dirty du—Embed
