Genius LyricsThere's a genius up and in you tonight
And the way you moving now, blazing the light
The living got us living in tice
Down to the wire, hearth it inside
Let it all hang out
You're a Jesus of goo
Tonight breaking out

Girl, I'm your genius tonight
If its alright, if its alright
Girl, I'm your genius tonight
If its alright, its alright
Now we might have been somewhat mesmerized
One by the other, just like on cloud nine
Up is sta getting whole lifetime
Is your instinct as guide
Where we both turn to life
It's alright now
Once and for all
The Jesus of goo, tonight breaking out

Your wish is coming true
I've been locked in
So long
Set me free, set me free, set me free
And the world still
My side
Right now

Your wish is coming true
Right time
To the set
Of night
Tonight
At last
Break out
Right time
To the set
Of night
To the night
At last
Break out
Break out

Your wish is coming true

Your wish is coming true
There's a genius up and in you tonight
And the way you moving now, blazing the light
The living got us living in tice
Down to the wire, hearth it inside
Let it all hang out
You're a Jesus of goo
Tonight breaking out
