Happy LyricsYou'll never feel happy
You'll never feel happy
Oh no you won't
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try

Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy

Everybody needs this
Everybody needs this

This song is not a gospel song
This song is not a funk song
This song is not a wrong song
But, this song is a real song, aah
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
(I wanna tell you)
Until you try
(Until you try)
You'll never feel happy
(Everybody feel)
Until you try
(Feel love)
(You'll never feel happy)
I need to be happy
(Until you try)
Every, every day
(You'll never feel happy)
Say love!
(Until you try)
Every, every night
(You'll never feel happy)
Gotta let yourself go
(Until you try)
Everybody
(You'll never feel happy)
Again and again
(Until you try)
Hey, you know what
Never never never never
Never never never never, feel
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
(Never never never never)
Until you try
(Never never never)
You'll never feel happy
(Never never never never never never never)
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try
Happy!
Until you try
You'll never feel happy
Until you try1Embed
