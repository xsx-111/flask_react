Le Banquet LyricsWe're going to begin to act
Beginning, today
To do whatever needs to be done!
Let's get on with the job!
Make some noise
The ultimate obstacle
You can't (beeping noise) with it
It's impossible
I've said it before, make some noise
World has turned over many times
And to transform the history of man
Either the will or the skill to fight
We are ready to take part
But now further action is required
Tonight the battle has been joined
We will not fail
Regrettably, we now believe that only force will make him leave.
I just wanna' say this right now
That regardless of what they say about it
There's nothing new, only different!
Never forget this, the future is to those who take it
Well, I say that nothing is easy, and the best things are the hardest.
That isn't enough,
It is madness!
Some men see things as they are and say why?
I dream things that never were and say why not.
Epic battle has ended,
Thank you, good night and farewell.1Embed
