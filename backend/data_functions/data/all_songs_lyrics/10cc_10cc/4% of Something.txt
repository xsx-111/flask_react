4% of Something Lyrics
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Well I don't like the way you work
It's all I can do

Working on a number
My fingers to the bone on my guitar
Working on a number
My fingers to the bone on my piano
All I got the end of the day
Is a message from the King

Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Well I don't like the way you work
It's all I can do

I'm trying to scratch a living
But all this man is giving me is the blues
I'm trying to scratch a living
But all the man is giving me is the blues
I've got to find a way to make my music play
Or I'm gonna lose my mind
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Well I don't like the way you work
It's all I can do
Hey


Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Well I don't like the way you work
It's all I can do (All right)

Four percent of something
Ten percent of nothing blue
Four percent of something
Ten percent of nothing blue
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
(Jonathan, you're a prat)
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blue
Four percent of something's
Better than ten percent of nothing blueEmbed
