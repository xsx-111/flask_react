Speed Kills Lyrics
One fine day
I started writing home
One finds
It's so hard to make it

It's gotta be the right time
It's gotta be the right kind line
It's gotta be the mainline

(Itâ€™s gotta be, gotta be, gotta be, gotta be)
(Gotta be, gotta be, gotta be, gotta be)
(Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be)
(Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be)...

One fine day
One fine day
One fine day

One fine day
One fine day
One fine day
One fine day
One fine day...Embed
