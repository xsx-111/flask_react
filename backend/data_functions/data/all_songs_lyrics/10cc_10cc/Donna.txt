Donna Lyrics
Whoa, Donna
You make me stand up
You make me sit down, Donna
Sit down, Donna
Sit down, you make me stand up

Donna, waiting by the telephone
Donna, waiting for the phone to ring

Whoa, Donna
You make me break up
You make me break down, Donna
Break down, Donna
Break down, you make me break up

Meanwhile, waiting by the telephone
Donna is waiting for the phone to ring

"Hello, darling
Yes, I love you darling
Yes, I love you"
Whoa, Donna
You make me stand up
You make me sit down, Donna
Sit down, Donna
Sit down, you make me stand up
Donna, I'd stand on my head for you

All mine, all mine, all mine
All mine, all mine, all mine

Donna, waiting by the telephone
Donna, waiting for the phone to ring

Whoa, Donna
Whoa, Donna
Whoa, Donna
Whoa, Donna
Donna, I love youEmbed
