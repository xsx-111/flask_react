The Dean and I Lyrics
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways

Hey kids, let me tell you
How I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin'
At the senior prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free

Hey sis, one kiss
And I was heaven-bound
Now who would've guessed
Milton's Paradise Lost could be found?
But in the eyes of the dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn't oughta
But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The dean, his daughter, and me
They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered, "I love you"
"Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol"
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses

Now, the paint is peeling
(Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways)
Now, and when the chips are down
(Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways)
Now, you kinda lose all feeling
(Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways)
Now, your head goes 'round and 'round
(Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways)

'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
I'm throwing myself off this train
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways
Humdrum days and a-humdrum ways

Humdrum days, he's got
Humdrum ways, oh boy

Hey, you know I'm really earning, now
My ship came in with a cargo of dollars
And my name's lit up on the prow

It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in dollars
(Rolling in dollars)
Rolling in dollars, nowEmbed
