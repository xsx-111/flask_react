Party in the Dark LyricsI see everything
All their suffering
Tiny vehicles
Space-age miracles
All our hearts were sore
No fight left in this war
Before the ghosts will chase
All those that rearrange
I, taken from those spirals be both kind
Hungry for another piece of mind
Silent and impatient without time
Directionless and innocent
What are yours to keep?
Definition three
Unkind and alone
End of the idea
I, taken from those spirals be both kind
Hungry for another piece of mind
Silent and impatient without time
Directionless and innocent
I, taken from those spirals be both kind
Hungry for another piece of mind
Silent and impatient without time
Directionless and innocent4Embed
