Drift & Die LyricsForgotten thoughts of yesterday
Through my eyes I see the past
Well I don't know I don't know I don't know why
I believe I believe I believe in the truth, from inside
Go away go away go away from me
Leave me alone
Ignorance spreads lies
How much will money buy
Well I'll take my time as I drift and die
Unwanted live my life a shame
Who's to blame for my mistakes

As I drift and die 
Ignorance spreads lies
How much will money buy
Well I'll take my time
As I drift and die Embed
