Bring Me Down LyricsMake no promises to me
You slowly melting
Wake up, then fall back asleep
You're quickly fading
Hey man, you'll have to wait your turn
I can see that you're Jonesing
Taste no flavors on my tongue
They've evaporated, you've disintegrated
Why you gotta bring me down
Why you gotta bring me
Bring me down
Karma comes around two times
So you better be good
Watch out for the unfamiliar signs
When you're going the wrong way
Look back to the devious minds
They keep pushing and pulling
Baby Jesus never sleeps
When you're being a sinner
Yeah, he'll eat you for dinner
Why you gotta bring me down
Why you gotta bring me down
Why you gotta bring me down, Down
Why you gotta bring me down
Bring me down
You gotta bring me down
You gotta bring me down, down
Bring me
Make no promises to me
You slowly melting
Baby Jesus never sleeps
When you're being a sinner
Hey man, you'll have to wait your turn
I can see that youre Jonesing
Taste no flavors on my tongue
They've evaporated, you've disintegrated
Why you gotta bring me down
Why you gotta bring me down
Why you gotta bring me down, down
Why you gotta bring me
So don't bring me downEmbed
