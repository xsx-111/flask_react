Out Of My Head LyricsWhat is wrong with all my friends
I know that I am unlike them
Just another situation
Don't hold me back
I don't look up to them
They always act so dirty
They keep themselves so clean
Why can't they find the answers to
The questions that are right in front of me
I'm so high
I'm never low
I hold the sky
Never letting go
Let it go
No one's ever listening
The lines I crossed somewhere between
My head is spinning like a top
I don't know when this shit is going to stop
They always act so dirty
They keep themselves so clean
Why can't they find the answers to
The questions that are right in front of me
I'm so high
I'm never low
I'll hold the sky
Never letting go
You fill my cup
I'm good to go
So shake me up
I'm ready to roll
Roll...roll...(I'll never let you) go...go
What is wrong with all my friends
I know that I am unlike them
They hold me back
They never will
I'm telling you these people
Are not my friends
I'm so high
I'm never low
I'll hold the sky
And I'm never letting go
You fill my cup
I'm good to go
So shake me up
I'm ready to roll
I'm never letting go
I'm never letting goEmbed
