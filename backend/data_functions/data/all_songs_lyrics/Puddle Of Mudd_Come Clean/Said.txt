Said LyricsEmotionless, I slip into the black
And there's no turning back
Now everyone around me smoking crack
This tunnel is blinding, hallucinating
I'm debating life, but it's still moving forward
If I could just change the hands of time
Well I'd do it better
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
Fearless, I have fell into a trap
And there's no way around it
Everyone is crying in the back
My kin is around me, hesitating
There's no second chance
When you know you're a loser
Keep on trying keep an open mind
I'm caught in a circle
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
Emotionless, I slip into the crack
Feel as if I've fell into the blue
Hallucinating, there's no turning back
Everyone around me smoking crack
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away
Have you even heard a thing I've said?Embed
