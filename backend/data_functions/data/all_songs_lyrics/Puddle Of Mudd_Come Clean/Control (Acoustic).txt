Control (Acoustic) LyricsOne, two, three, four
I love the way you look at me
I feel the pain you place inside
You lock me up inside your dirty cage
While I'm alone inside my mind
I'd like to teach you all the rules
I get to see them set in stone
I like it when you chain me to the bed
Well, then your secrets never shown
And I need to feel you, you need to feel me
I can't control you, you're not the one for me, no
I can't control you, you can't control me
I need to feel you so why's it even
I love the way you break my skin
I feel the hate you place inside
I need to get your voice out of my head
'Cause I'm the guy you'll never find
I think you know all the rules
There's no expressions on your face
I hope that some day you will let me go
Release me from my dirty cage
I need to feel you, you need to feel me
I can't control you, you're not the one for me, no
I can't control you, you can't control me
I need to feel you so why's it even you and me
I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I'll have control of you
I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I'll have control of you
I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I'll have control of you
I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I'll have control of you
I need to feel you, you need to feel me
I can't control you, you're not the one for me, no
I can't control you, you can't control me
I need to feel you so why's it even you and me
You're not the one for me, no
You're not the one for me, no
You're not the one for me, no
You're not the one for me, noEmbed
