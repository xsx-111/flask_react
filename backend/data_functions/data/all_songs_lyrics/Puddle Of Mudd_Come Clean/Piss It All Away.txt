Piss It All Away LyricsWhat I feel, it is real
What I do, it's the truth
When I drink, I can't think
When I use, I need more
When you're weak, I can't speak
Close your eyes and taste this wine
The cork removed, less purified
I throw away everything that you say
Erase everything that you think
What I feel, it's a sin
Tell the truth, do not lie
Make a wish, won't come true
One way streets, one track mind
Open up and see the light
One million ways to hypnotize
I throw away everything that you say
Erase everything that you think
Erase everything that you think
Piss it, piss it all awayEmbed
