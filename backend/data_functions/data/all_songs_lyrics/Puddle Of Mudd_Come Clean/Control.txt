Control Lyrics
I love the way you look at me
I feel the pain you place inside
You lock me up inside your dirty cage
While I'm alone inside my mind
I like to teach you all the rules
I get to see them set in stone
I like it when you chain me to the bed
But then your secrets never show

I need to feel you
You need to feel me
I can't control you
You're not the one for me, no
I can't control you
You can't control me
I need to feel you
So why's there even

I love the way you rake my skin
I feel the hate you place inside
I need to get your voice out of my head
'Cause I'm that guy you'll never find
I think you know all of the rules
There's no expressions on your face
I hope that someday you will let me go
Release me from my dirty cage
I need to feel you
You need to feel me
I can't control you
You're not the one for me, no
I can't control you
You can't control me
I need to feel you
So why's there even
You and me

I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I have control of you
I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I have control of you
I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I have control of you
I love the way you look at me
I love the way you smack my ass
I love the dirty things you do
I have control of you
I need to feel you
You need to feel me
I can't control you
You're not the one for me, no
I can't control you
You can't control me
I need to feel you
So why's there even
You and me

You're not the one for me, no
You're not the one for me, no
You're not the one for me, no
You're not the one for me, no1Embed
