Basement LyricsYeah...locked in the basement
I'm so paranoid I'm all encased and I can't escape
And when I look up, mother's looking down
And when I wake up, mother's not around
So if you want
You can have everything that I've got
So if you want
You can take it all away from me
Away from me
Away from me
Away from me
Nobody's perfect, but you just can't see
My life's a circus that you don't believe
You're sayin' something, but not coming clean
Now when I look up, mother's livin', she's livin' in her dreams
So if you want
You can have everything that I've got
So if you want
You can take it all away from me
Away from me
Away from me
Away from me
So if you're unsatisfied
Well, I'll watch you wave goodbye
So if you want
You can take it all away from me
Please don't come down and see me this way
Please don't come down, I'm too afraid
Please don't come down and see me this way
Please don't come down, well I'm too afraid...Embed
