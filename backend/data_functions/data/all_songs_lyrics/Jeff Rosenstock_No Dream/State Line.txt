State Line Lyrics
So long, been staying home less than leaving
Anxious more often than lookin' alive
Stoned more than feeling, drunk more than sleeping
Too loud in Sweden, they turned off the lights
Can I take a piece of you?

Swerving through mountains after the night shift
Pull off in traffic and let me outside
Carelessly plant it, sleep mask and wishing
"Turn into something, don’t let it die"

Can I take a piece of you 'cross the state line
Like the rhythm steals my body
Like the song that steals my mind?
The feeling that follows you from a past life
When you lose it in a moment
Can you tell yourself it's fine?

Pictures of toilets across the planet
Stuff this in your pocket and wait in the line
Trade it for chocolates, cough drops, some weird chips
Coffee or something, I don’t have the time
Can I take a piece of you 'cross the state line
Like the rhythm steals my body
Like the song that steals my mind?
The feeling that follows you from a past life
When you lose it in a moment
Can you tell yourself it's fine
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine? Yeah2Embed
