The Beauty of Breathing Lyrics
Hey, hey

Sometimes I wanna take the car out on the road
And flip it into park and smash myself
Into a million little pieces
I'm tired of knowing what about myself is wrong
But never mustering up the resolve
To really try to change it

I walk outside and people say, "Hey!"
And sometimes I just wanna say
"Hey, go away, go away"
So I guess I better stay inside

I've read that if you just sit in a chair and think
Of focusing your nervous energy
On the beauty of breathing
You could live a life of real tranquility
But I just thought of every stupid thing
That's been keeping me from sleeping

I close my eyes and it won't go away
I plug my ears, but they're ringing out
"Hey, hey, hey"
It keeps, keeps me from believing
That maybe someday the thing will work
And maybe I won't feel like a jerk
And maybe the words I say will stop coming out weighted
Maybe someday I'll wanna breathe
And maybe the people that I meet
Won't lead to a certain future where I'm betrayed
And I'm so jaded, I'm so jaded
And that, that's why I'm so fucking sadEmbed
