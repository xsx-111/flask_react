NO TIME Lyrics
Did you learn to make amends with your pile of flaming shit?
Gain the patience to deal with total idiots?
Without losing your composure, oh please tell me how it is

I didn't have the time

Did you learn to forge a path towards existing comfortably
In a total nightmare concurrent with legal weed?
Did you harness the inner fortitude to present gracefully?

I didn't have the time

When you wake, does it feel like you have a purpose?
When you wake, does it feel like you had a purpose all along?

Exploiting all my deep narcissistic tendencies
Basking in the fruits of my soft complicity
Did you turn into a person that you really want to be?

I didn't have the time
I didn't have the time
I didn't have the time
I didn't have the time
I didn't have—Embed
