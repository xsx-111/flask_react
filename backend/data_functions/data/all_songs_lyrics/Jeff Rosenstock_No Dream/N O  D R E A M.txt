N O  D R E A M Lyrics
They were picking up the bodies on TV
When I caught a reflection of you and me
Staring back at us while frozen on the screen
Crank the white noise and pretend that we're asleep
That we're asleep, dream, dream, dream, dream

They were separating families carelessly
Under the guise of protecting you and me
Jailing innocents, no hope of being free
Crank the white noise and pretend that we're asleep
That we're asleep, dream, dream, dream, dream

They were lining up the unsuspecting teens
For a violent moment of celebrity
Golden bullets blessed by lobbyist money
Splash a tidal wave of blood into your stream
Weaponizing what's left of your empathy
Trapped inside a void that zeroes out the screams

It's not a dream, it's not a dream
It's not a dream, it's not a dream
It's not a dream, it's not a dream
It's not a dream, it's not a dream
It's not a dream, not a dream, not a dream
It's not a dream, not a dream, not a dream, not a dream
It's not a dream, not a dream, not a dream, not a dream
It's not a dream, not a dream, not a dream, not a—
The only framework capitalism can thrive in is dystopia
Fuck all the fakers acting like they’re interested in hearing us
When we yell, "Hold accountable the architects of hopelessness and never ending violence"
They'll be like, "Whatever, idiot" and fuel their brand of power
Incorruptible like it exists
Saintly fronts in a system that rewards only the greediest
The only endgame for capitalism is dystopia
And we know all about it, but we just don't know what to do
What can we do? What can we do? What can we do?

Nothing more to see here, y'all
Good night, start heading towards the exit
Nothing more to see here, y'all
Good night, start heading towards the exit
Nothing more to see here, y'all
Good night, start heading towards the exit
Nothing more to see here, y'all
Good night, start heading towards the exit
Fuck violenceEmbed
