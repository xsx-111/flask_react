Nikes (Alt) Lyrics
Looking down the barrel of a shitty future
Throwing back whatever we can to avoid the dread
Of what's been said, but there's just no escaping it
Trying to find the words to explain what it feels like
Buggin' out like, "Wait, did I say something weird?"
But that is just the price of faking like we're innocent

Chasing bliss
Chasing bliss is only numbing it

Looking for a dream that won't morph to a nightmare
Lying to myself about things that I love
'Cause I'm distracted by public displays of happiness
So I scour the internet for a new pair of Nikes
Status symbol shit that I say I'm above
Disown control, oh no, oh no, I'm fucking full of shit

Stinkin' rich hypocrite
No, it's not gonna bring no happiness
No, it's not gonna bring no happiness

There's no faking bliss
There's no faking bliss
There's no faking bliss
There's no faking bliss, no, no, no2Embed
