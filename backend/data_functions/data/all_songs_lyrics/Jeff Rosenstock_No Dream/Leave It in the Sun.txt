Leave It in the Sun Lyrics
Ayy

Don't let me know all the reasons that it probably shouldn't work
Or let me know all the things I'll never do
Don't go reframing my truth in a context versus you
All aggressive like I got something to prove

If you knew that I think about you every single day
Would it make you feel like I'm too much for you?
Or would you kinda wanna say, "You don't have to feel that way
I've been trying not to think about you too"

Leave it in the sun to melt away
Leave it in the sun to melt away
Or burn the skin

Leave it in the sun to melt away
Leave it in the sun to melt away
Leave it in the sun 'til the colors fade
Leave it in the sun to melt away
Or burn the skin
Subconsciously stacked an empty beer can pyramid
On a shaky table in a stranger's home
When I hightail out of town, someone else will knock it down
Because I'm too proud to do it on my own
(Leave it in the sun, let it melt away)
The hardest part of growing up is letting go
(Leave it in the sun, let it melt away)
The hardest part of growing up is letting go (Let it go)Embed
