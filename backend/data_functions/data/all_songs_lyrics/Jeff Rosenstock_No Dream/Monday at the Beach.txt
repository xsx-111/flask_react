Monday at the Beach Lyrics
If the weather stays as good or better
I  might wake up early and escape
If  the terror of our end together
Can stay still enough to wake up late

I don't know if it will take four hours there and back by train
I  don’t know if the whole wide world is gonna end while I'm away
I  don't know if I deserve to go

But it’s a Monday at the beach
Monday  at the beach
Monday at the beach
Monday at the beach

If the weather can keep it together1Embed
