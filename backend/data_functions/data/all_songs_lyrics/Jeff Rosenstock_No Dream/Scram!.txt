Scram! Lyrics
I've been told for most my life
"Wait until the perfect time"
By people who have been defined by
Skipping spots in line

And don't you want to go away?
And don't you want to go away?
But don't you want to go away?
Don't you want to scram?

I've been told for most my life
"Try to see the other side"
By people who have never tried to
See the other side

And don't you want to go away?
And don't you want to go away?
And don't you want to go away?
Don't you want to scram?
And don't you want to hide?
And don't you want to get away tonight?
Don't you want to run?
And don't you want to die?
And don't you want to get away tonight?
Not hearing all your shit
Don't waste my fucking time
And don't you want to get away tonight?
Go kick rocks and die, woo!
Everything you say is to make me feel stupid
Everything you say is to make me feel bad
Everything you say is a distraction
Well, I'm not listening to
Yeah, I'm not listening to
Yeah, I'm not listening to you
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh

Don't you want to go away?
Don't you want to go away?
Don't you want to go away?
Don't you want to go away?
Don't you want to run?
But don't you want to hide?
But don't you want to get away tonight?
Don't you want to run?
And don't you want to hide?
And don't you want to scram?
And don't you want to scram?1Embed
