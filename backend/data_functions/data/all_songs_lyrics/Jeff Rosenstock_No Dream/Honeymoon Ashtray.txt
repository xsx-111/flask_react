Honeymoon Ashtray Lyrics
Early afternoon at the souvenir shop
Bought a funny ashtray for a couple bucks
Then we ate pizza under the moonlight
Or we ate french fries under the moonlight
Why would any hotel have a bearskin rug?
Why would they assume I'm cool with where it's from?
I murmured to you soaking in the sky
I murmured to you soaking in the sky

Soon enough, it can't get any darker
We'll toss and turn once it starts getting hotter
Woah

You can give me an ultimatum with a loaded gun
I still can't tell you what day of the week we're on
Some days I blink and suddenly it's night
And I broke my promise, didn't go outside
The dust collects the second that you wipe it off
Too late to vacuum, but not too late to toss
The roaches I discarded late at night
That piled up in the ashtray over time

It feels indicative of a disaster
Manifestation of ambitions shattered
And I'll lean into it and keep getting sadder
It doesn't mean that it really matters
It doesn't mean that it really matters
Yeah, honestly, it doesn't
It doesn't even matter
Everything's not just a fucking omen
Under the blankets in our messy home
Let's remind each other what we're doing right
'Cause seek through cracks and surely we will find
Yeah, seek through cracks and surely we will find
Don't seek through cracks when everything is fine
