Ohio Tpke Lyrics
Ohio Turnpike
Another hour or two
Counting the dashed lines
Bringing me back to you
Another short night
And our summer is through
So pick a good song
To usher you through the gloom

When I see your face after the flight home
I know I-I-I-I'm not alone
When you call my name through the modern snow
I know I-I-I-I'm not alone

I ditched the rental
Grabbed the receipts off the dash
Threw out the baggie
Of coffee grounds and ash
I'll let you go now
That's all I've gotta report
Sorry I didn't get
Better at being short
When I see your face after the flight home
I know I-I-I-I'm not alone
Can you call my name through the modern snow?
Because I don't wanna feel alone
Because I don't wanna feel alone
No, I don't wanna feel alone
Because I don't wanna feel alone

Prepare for the landing and prepare to be vaguely accused
By the sad and underslept in their royal blues
Dead in the window, 'cause I wanna know what it'd feel like
If I got to go outside

And at the bag claim with eyes peeled for tatters of tags
Flying half-mast like the flag
And through the families, we wade in a quest for a cab
But nobody wishes for the things that they already have
We relive every misstep that we've made in our lives
And hoard our scary secrets 'til they wake us at night
And we think we can't escape from it, but maybe we might
If we try to just acknowledge we can do anything right
You know you're the only person that I wanted to like me
You're the only person that I wanted to like me
All these other motherfucking dipshits can bite me
'Cause you're the only person that I wanted to like me
You're the only person that I wanted to like me
You're the only person that I wanted to like me
You're the only person that I wanted to like me
Ohio Turnpike,, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohio Turnpike,, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I miss coming home to you
I miss coming home to you
I miss coming home to you
I hate coming home
I hate leaving home
I hate coming home
I hate leaving homeEmbed
