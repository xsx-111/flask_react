Distance Equals Rate Times Time Lyrics
I had me a vision
There wasn't any television
From looking into the sun

Looking into the sun
We got to think quick
Says blind Saint Nick, hey
From looking into the sun
Looking into the sun
We got to get some beer
We got no atmosphere
From looking into the sun
Looking into the sun

I had me a vision
There wasn't any television
From looking into the sun
From looking into the sun
From looking into the sun
From looking into the sun1Embed
