The Sad Punk LyricsI smell smoke
That comes from a gun
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named e-
It was so long ago
Could have happened to anyone
He was struck by a bullet
And he melted into fluid
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named e-
Extinction
One thousand miles an hour
I'm just like anyone
I want to feel
The road of tar beneath the wheel
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named e-
WHOA WHOA
And evolving from the sea
Would not be too much time for me
To walk beside you in the sun
I read something
About a son of a gun
Named extinction
Extinction
