Space (I Believe In) LyricsWe needed something to move and fill up the space
We needed something this always is just the case
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey took up his place
Sat on a carpet and with tablas in hand took up the chase
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Now it occurred to me as he drove away
D equals R times T
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Spacious
(He's so)
Spacious
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Space
I believe in space
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Now I'm going to sing the Perry Mason theme
(He's so)
Spacious
(He's so)
Spacious
(He's so, he's so)
Spacious
(He's so)
Spacious
Jefrey with one f, Jefrey
Jefrey with one f, one fEmbed
