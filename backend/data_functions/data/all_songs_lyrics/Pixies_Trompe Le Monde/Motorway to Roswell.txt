Motorway to Roswell Lyrics
Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but he could not make it
Last night he could not make it

On a holiday
So many miles
Looking for a place to stay
Near some friendly star
He found this mote
And now we wonder where we are
How could this so great
Turn so shitty
He ended up in army crates
And photographs in files
His tiny boat
Sparked as he turned to graze our city

I started driving on the motorway
I was feeling down

Last night he could not make it
Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but he could not make it
Last night he could not make...
On a holiday
So many miles
Looking for a place to stay
Near some friendly star
He found this mote
And now we wonder
How could this so great
Turn so shit
He ended up in army crates
And photographs in files
His tiny boat
Sparked as he grazed it

Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but he could not make it
Last night he could not make it
He tried hard but he could not make it

He started heading for the motorway
And he came right now
He started heading for the motorway
And he came right now
He started heading for the motorway
And he came right now
He started heading for the motorway
And he came right now
He started heading for the motorway
And he came right now
He started heading for the motorway
And he came right now
He started heading for the motorway
And he came right now2Embed
