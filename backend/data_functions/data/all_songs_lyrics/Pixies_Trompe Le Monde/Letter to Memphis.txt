Letter to Memphis Lyrics
The day since I met her
I can't believe it's true
She came here from Memphis
Across the ocean, sailing
And I saw her, and I pleaded
''Why do you come so far?'' and she said

Trying to get to you
How I tried to get you
Trying to get to you

I'm sending a letter
I'll send it right to you
I'll send it to Memphis
I know that someday
Everything I needed and I wanted
Used to be that my head was haunted

And all these sirens, they make me mad
And all this violence, it brings me down
I feel strong, I feel lucky
