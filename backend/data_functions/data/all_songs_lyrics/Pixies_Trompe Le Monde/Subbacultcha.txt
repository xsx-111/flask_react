Subbacultcha Lyrics
There is something about this song
This is a song about something there

We did the clubs, what ass
I was hoping to have her in the sack
I was looking handsome
She was looking like an erotic vulture

I was all dressed in black
She was all dressed up in black
Everything was fine down here
What you call it here?
Call it what you will here
Way down in this
Subbacultcha

Her warm white belly
In the life I'd lived had seen nothing finer
She shakes and she moves me or something
She's like jellyroll, like sculpture

I was wearing eyeliner
She was wearing eyeliner
It was so good down here
Saving for my scrapbook here
Way down, down, down in this
Subbacultcha
Now we live on the sea
And relax and ride the tack
Drug running on this Panamanian schooner

She walks the deck in a black dress
And me I dress up in black
And we listen to the sea
And look at the sky in a poetic kind of way
What you call it when you look at the sky in a poetic kind of way?
You know when you grope for luna!Embed
