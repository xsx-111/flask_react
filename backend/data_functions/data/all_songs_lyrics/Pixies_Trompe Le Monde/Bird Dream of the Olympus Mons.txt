Bird Dream of the Olympus Mons LyricsSpeed leaving without warning
I need some place to sleep tonight
Blowing in the rocking
Of the pine
Speed leaving without warning
The sunlight is going
Into the mountain
I will crawl
Into the mountain
Sun shines in the rusty morning
Skyline of the Olympus Mons
I think about it sometimes
Sun shines in the rusty morning
Once I had a good fly
Into the mountain
I will fall
Into the mountain
Oh yeah
Into the mountain
I will fall
Into the mountain
Oh yeah
Into the mountain
I will fall
I will fall1Embed
