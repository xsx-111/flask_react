Head On Lyrics
As soon as I get my head around you
I come around catching sparks off you
I'm getting electric shocks from you
This secondhand living just won't do
And the way I feel tonight
I could die and I wouldn't mind
And there's something going on inside

Makes you wanna feel
Makes you wanna try
Makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky

And I can't stand up
I can't cool down
I can't get my head off the ground
As soon as I get my head around you
I come around catching sparks off you
And all I ever got from you
Was all I ever took from you
Yeah, the world could die in pain
And I wouldn't feel no shame
And there's nothing holding me to blame
Makes you wanna feel
Makes you wanna try
Makes you wanna blow the stars from the sky
And I'm taking myself to a dirty part of town
Where all my troubles can't be found
I said yeah yeah yeah yeah

I'm taking myself to a dirty part of town
Where all my troubles can't be found
Makes you wanna feel
Makes you wanna blow the stars from the skyEmbed
