U-Mass LyricsIn the sleepy west
Of the woody east
Is a valley full
Full o' pioneer
We're not just kids
To say the least
We got ideas
To us that's dear
Like capitalist
Like communist
Like lots of things
You've heard about
And redneckers
They get us pissed
And stupid stuff
It makes us shout
Oh dance with me
Oh don't be shy
Oh kiss me cunt
Oh kiss me cock
Oh kiss the world
Oh kiss the sky
Oh kiss my ass
Oh let it rock
Of the April birds
And the May bee
Oh baby
