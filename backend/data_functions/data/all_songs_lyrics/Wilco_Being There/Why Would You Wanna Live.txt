Why Would You Wanna Live Lyrics
It's all happened here before
I know you've seen it too
I know you've seen it too
And it's all happened to you
Kid, you've paid your dues
Dues and dues

Why would you
Want to live
In this world
Why would you
Want to live
In this world

I know you watch the news
I've seen it too
I've seen it too
And it's all happened to you
Kid, you've paid your dues
Dues and dues
Why would you
Want to live
In this world

Why wouldn't you
Want to live
In this world
Wouldn't you
Want to liveEmbed
