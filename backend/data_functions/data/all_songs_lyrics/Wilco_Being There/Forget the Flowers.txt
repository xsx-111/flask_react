Forget the Flowers LyricsYou're trying my patience, try pink carnations
Red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers, someday, I know you will
Displayers of affection and all good intentions
Why don't you just send me the bill
Don't forget the flowers, someday, I know you will
Lately you've been taking me
Way too seriously, oooh
I can't ever explain why
I don't feel your pain, oooh
I left you behind, I know it's been a long time
But I'm not over you
Don't forget the flowers, someday, I hope I do
You're trying my patience, try pink carnations
Red roses and yellow daffodils
Don't forget the flowers, someday
I know I will
Don't forget the flowers, someday
I know I willEmbed
