Kingpin LyricsI want to be your kingpin
Living in Pekin
I want to be your bigwig
Living in Pekin
I got the flu and away I flew
N.Y.C.P.D. blue
Dimatapp and Spinal Tap
City maps and hand claps
Statue of Liberty play
It only works once
Don't throw it away
'Cause I want to be your kingpin
Living in Pekin
Living in Pekin
Living in
How can I
How can I give my love to you when
I don't know what to doEmbed
