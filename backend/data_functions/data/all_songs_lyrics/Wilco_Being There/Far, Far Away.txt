Far, Far Away LyricsFar, far away from those city lights
They might be shining on you tonight
Far, far away from you
On the dark side of the room
I long to hold you in my arms and sway
Kiss and ride on the CTA
I need to see you tonight
Those bright lights
Oh, I know it's right
Deep in my heart
I'll know it's right
By the bed
By the light that you read by
By the time
That I get home to say good night
I need to see you again
On the dark side, my friend
On the dark sideEmbed
