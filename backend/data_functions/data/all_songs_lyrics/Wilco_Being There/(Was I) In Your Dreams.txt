(Was I) In Your Dreams LyricsWas I in your dreams? I'd like to know
Did I touch your hand and did it feel like snow?
Try to understand while I've got you on the phone
Did I hurt you like I know I can?
Tell me why you'd ever want to leave your loving man
Try to understand, please try to understand
Was I in your dreams?
Was I in your dreams?
Does a dreamer die when his dreams die too?
I don't really mind if I dream about you
I can't say what any of that means
Was I in your dreams late last night?
Did you hold your pillow? Did you squeeze me tight?
I just want to make everything all right
Was I in your dreams?
Was I in your dreams?
Was I?Embed
