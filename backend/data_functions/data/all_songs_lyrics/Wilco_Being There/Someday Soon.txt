Someday Soon LyricsWind will blow and the sun will shine
On that hill where we used to climb
I'll look in your eyes and you'll be mine
Someday soon
I won't even make a scene
That will be just like a dream
Cash is gonna flow down by the old mainstream
Someday soon
You don't know me, but I know you (you don't know me)
You have no idea what I'd do (what I'd do)
To make you mine and see you swoon
Someday soon
Sun's gonna shine, wind's gonna blow
On that hill where we used to go
I'll look in your eyes and down I will roll
Someday soon
Someday, someday soon
Someday, someday soonEmbed
