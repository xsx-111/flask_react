Red-Eyed and Blue LyricsWe've got solid state technology
Tapes on the floor
Some songs we can't afford to play
When we came here today
All I wanted to say
Is how much I miss you
Alcohol and cotton balls
And some drugs
We can't afford on the way
When we came here today
We all felt something true
Now I'm red-eyed and blue2Embed
