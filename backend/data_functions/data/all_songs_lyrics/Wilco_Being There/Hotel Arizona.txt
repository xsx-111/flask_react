Hotel Arizona Lyrics
Hotel in Arizona
Made us all want to feel like stars
Rental cars with tinted windows
Leave another number for me

Even if I make it through
That's just something that I have to get used to
That's just something I have to get used to

I feel some connection
Between you and me
Well I guess there's some direction
Maybe you can't see

Even at the interview
That's not something that I'm going to get used to
That's not something I'm going to get used to

Hello, can you hear me
Hello, that's all there is
That's all there is
I guess all this history is just a mystery to me
One more worried whisper right in my earEmbed
