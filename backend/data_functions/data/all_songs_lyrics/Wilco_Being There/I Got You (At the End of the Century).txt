I Got You (At the End of the Century) LyricsI got you and that's all I need
I got you and that's all I need
I got you and that's all I need
I got you
I got you and I still believe
That you are all I will ever need
It's you, oh
All the way back in the seventies
You were my little TV queen
Guitarzan and your friend Janine
I got you
I got you and I still believe
That you are all I will ever need
It's you, oh
It's the end of the century
And I can't think of anything
Except you
It's the end of the century
And I can't think of anything
But you, oh
All, I, need
I got you
I got you, babe
I got youEmbed
