Monday Lyrics
Choo-Choo Charlie had a plenty good band
But he couldn't understand why no one would go
The World Record Players on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixing his van with a left arm tan
He said:

"Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of FLA
In school, yeah
I fooled ya
Now I know I made a mistake"

Blister on a turnpike, let me by
I only want to wonder why when I don't die
Ooh, I shot you, yeah, I know
I only want to go where my wheels roll

Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of FLA
I fooled ya
In school, yeah
Now I know I made a mistake
Everybody's wondering, "Where'd he go?"
He must be down in Pensacola hiding from the snow
The World Record Players on a tour of Japan
Charlie's fixin' his van, he's waitin' for a postcard
And he said:

"Monday, I'm all high
Get me out of TLA
Well, I cut class
In school, yeah
Now I know I made a mistake
I made a big mistake, alright"

Yeah, alright
Alright, alright
Alright
Man, I've been listenin' to Creedence Clearwater Revival
