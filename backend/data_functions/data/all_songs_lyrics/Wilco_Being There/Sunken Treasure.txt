Sunken Treasure LyricsThere's rows and rows of houses
With windows painted blue
With the light from a TV
Running parallel to you
But there is no sunken treasure
Rumored to be
Wrapped inside my ribs
In a sea, black with ink
I am so
Out of tune
With you
I am so out of tune
With you
If I had a mountain
I'd try to fold it over
If I had a boat (probably roll over)
You know I'd probably roll over (leave it on the shore)
And I leave it on the shore (leave it for somebody)
I'd leave it for somebody
Surely there's somebody
Who needs it more than me
I am so
Out of tune
With you
I am so out of tune
With you
For all the leaves we'll burn
In autumn fires and then return
For all the fires we burn
All will return
Music is my savior
I was maimed by rock and roll
I was maimed by rock and roll
I was tamed by rock and roll
I got my name from rock and roll1Embed
