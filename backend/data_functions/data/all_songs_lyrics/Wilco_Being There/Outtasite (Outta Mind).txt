Outtasite (Outta Mind) Lyrics
I know we don't talk much
But you're such a good talker, oh whoa
I know we should take a walk
But you're such a fast walker, oh whoa
Well alright

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Out of mind, out of sight

Well okay, I know you don't love me
But you'll still be thinking of me, oh whoa
Well alright, I know you probably hate me
That's okay with me
Alright

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Out of mind, out of sight
Out of mind, out of sight

You don't see me now
You don't want to anyhow
Look out, here I come again
And I'm bringing my friends
Look out, here I come again
I'm bringing my friends
Okay, alright, okay, alright

I know where I'll be tonight, alright
Out of mind, out of sight
Out of mind, out of sight
Out of mind, out of sightEmbed
