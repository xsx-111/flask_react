Dreamer in My Dreams LyricsWell there's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
With light shining off the snow
Well there's a singer in my heart
Burning up the charts
With songs about things we all know
Well there's a blister on his brain
That's driving him insane
'Cause all good things, they gotta go
Well there's a child on the way
It could be any day
But how this life will change we don't know
Well there's a child on the way
Gonna look just like him
One day, he's gonna say
"Ain't you my dad?"
Then he's gonna look down and smile
And after a while, he'll say
"That's for sure, 'cause you got my eyes."
Well there's a dreamer in my dreams
He's hanging from the beams
With light shining off the snow
There's a blister on his brain
It's driving him insane
'Cause all the good things have to go
There's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
With a light shining off the lake
Well, I know I made mistakes
I'm passing then all on
But I hope he gets up before dawn
All right
(Yeah, that's it)
There's a dreamer in my dreams
Climbing up the back
Of a car they used to call a Cadillac
It's got a brand new set of keys
He's got a new look, he's got a new look
And he's gonna, he's gonna take it all away
(I believe it)
There's a dreamer in my dreams
Swinging from the beams
All jacked up in my garage
He's hanging from a belt
He don't know what he's done
Just don't forget to say goodbye when he's gone
(Oh! That's it!)Embed
