Breathe You In Lyrics
Baby help me, I feel empty
It's like there's something wrong with me
I can't shake the thought of drowning
I swallowed water in my sleep

I can't leave again
Time is something we don't have
Lay with me, my friend
Let me breathe you in
If I could I would stop the whole world
To grow old with you and die in this moment

Let me breathe you in
Let me breathe you in

I see your face in everything
A fleeting memory of where I want to be
I roll your hair between my fingertips
But that won't make it real

I was never scared of dying alone
Until I knew what it was like to have a home
I can't leave again
Time is something we don't have
Lay with me, my friend
Let me breathe you in
If I could I would stop the whole world
To grow old with you and die in this moment

I was never scared of dying alone
Until I knew what it was like to have a home
I was never scared of dying alone
Until I knew what it was like to have a home

I can't leave again
Time is something we don't have
Lay with me, my friend
Let me breathe you in
If I could I would stop the whole world
To grow old with you and die in this moment

Let me breathe you in
Let me breathe you in3Embed
