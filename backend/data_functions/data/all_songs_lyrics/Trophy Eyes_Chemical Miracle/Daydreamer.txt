Daydreamer Lyrics
Landed alone in a city that used to love me
Running from a six month winter that wants me back
I know it's summer, but Sydney's December is
More cold blooded than I remember and
These two bags are all that I have left

I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I love them

A snap glance between yourselves
When I don't get it right
Where do you go when I'm around?
These days are like the old days but you just care a little less
I don't blame you, I don't really like myself that much as well

I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I love them
Pack of cigarettes didn't stand a chance
Domestic airport on my own, welcome home
Pack of cigarettes didn't stand a chance
Domestic airport on my own, welcome home

I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I got friends, I got friends
They don't love me like I love them
I love them

Daydreamer
No one's gonna love you like you love them
It's like your old man said
"It's not your fault, you're just different"
Alone and different
Daydreamer
No one's going to love you like you love them
It's like your old man said
"It's not your fault, you're just different"
Alone and different1Embed
