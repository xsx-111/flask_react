Chemical LyricsBreak it down to an inside voice
The one that speaks the loudest always knows the least
We know the speed of light
But not the speed of thought. -
Is it chemical or miracle each time we talk?
What is a minute but a man made name?
Given to the emptiness and infinite space
To comprehend the time between asleep and awake
And read it on our graves
As a dash between the dates
We're so afraid
Of the limits we've made
If love is just a chemical reaction
Why is death so different?Embed
