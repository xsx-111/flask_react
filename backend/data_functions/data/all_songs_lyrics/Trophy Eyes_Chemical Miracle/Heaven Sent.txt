Heaven Sent Lyrics
Lay your head on my shoulder
As I draw pictures in your skin
I leave lines behind with my fingertips
Like lines in wet sand
One day, the tide will come
And wash away everything that I did
And your memories of me
Will disappear into bad dreams

So stay away from me
Now that you know what kind of man I can be
Breaking hearts is second nature to me
I'll step over you just to get what I need

So damn smart and interesting
Don't say that you weren't warned
I will only break your heart
So damn smart and interesting
Don't say that you weren't warned
I'm so dangerous

So stay away from me
Now that you know what kind of man I can be
Breaking hearts is second nature to me
And I'll step over you just to get what I need
A broken heart will take some time
But I'll be better overnight
I see the tremble in your smile
Don't cry for me, I can't feel it
You should have listened to me
You should have listened to me
You should have listened to me
You should have listened to me

So stay away from me
Now that you know what kind of man I can be
Breaking hearts is second nature to me
And I'll step over you just to get what I need
A broken heart will take some time
But I'll be better overnight
I see the tremble in your smile
Don't cry for me, I can't feel it
Don't cry for me, I can't feel it

So damn smart and interesting
Don't say that you weren't warned
I'm so dangerous1Embed
