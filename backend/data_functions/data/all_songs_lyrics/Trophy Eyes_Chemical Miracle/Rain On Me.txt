Rain On Me Lyrics
Rain
Rain on me
Every raindrop that touches my skin
Makes a sound like your name
Makes a sound like your name

It made a hole inside of me
A hungry aching void
That clamoured to be filled
And only found easement in your voice

I'll keep the world awake
For taking me away
As long as there's breath left in me
None shall sleep
Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake

I can feel it deep inside of me
I can feel it burning in my skin
But I'm too old - too firmly moulded
To say how you make me feel


Stay
I'll be your favourite mistake1Embed
