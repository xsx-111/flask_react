Counting Sheep Lyrics
I keep my days open for sleeping in
I'll keep my days open for sleeping in
A late night phone call from someone you don't miss
You keep them alive with simple small talk shit

Uncomfortably honest, and honestly lonely
You've got somewhere to be
Hey man, don't worry about me
The city stopped moving
I'm alone with my secrets
I could probably hang myself with the curtains

This is the portrait of a man, morning coffee in his hand
With front row seats to old repeats of a highlight reel for years
Yeah
And all the things I never said are doing circles in my head
Like counting sheep with no relief
Just another night on my own, yeah

I keep my days open for sleeping in
I'll keep my days open for sleeping in
A late night phone call from someone you don't miss
You keep them alive with simple small talk shit
Please don’t let me leave alone tonight
I’ll wait by your driveway in case you change your mind
And we can keep drinking 'til it feels alright
You know we don’t have to talk, we could just be alive
Please don’t let me leave on my own tonight
You know I’ll wait by your driveway in case you change your mind
And we can keep drinking 'til it feels alright
You know we don’t have to talk we could just be alive

I keep my days open for sleeping in
I'll keep my days open for sleeping in

This is a portrait of a man, morning coffee in his hand
With front row seats to old repeats of a highlight reel for years, yeah
And all the things I never said are doing circles in my head
Like counting sheep with no relief
Just another night on my own
This is a portrait of a man, morning coffee in his hand
With front row seats to old repeats of a highlight reel for years, yeah
And all the things I never said are doing circles in my head
Like counting sheep with no relief
Just another night on my own1Embed
