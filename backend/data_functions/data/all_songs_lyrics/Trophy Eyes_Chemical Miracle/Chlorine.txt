Chlorine Lyrics
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing

Water ran from my body
Crystal clear, chlorinated and sky blue
As the icy cold brought life back to my feet
Every breath in was something I owed you

I heard they cut you down in your own bedroom
I wondered if you'd still remember

When we remember
We only get a version of the last time we remember it
And as time rolls on like it always does
Though it might be a little different, I won't forget
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

Tell me why I didn't die in that swimming pool?
When you saved my life, did you know that, that would take your own?
Who decides if we stay or if we go?
Did it cross your mind that I'm alive because of you?
I heard they cut you down in your own bedroom
I wonder if you'd still remembered
You gave it all away for a girl
You didn't fix it, you just ended it
I heard they cut you down in your own bedroom
I wonder if you'd still remembered
You gave it all away for a girl
You didn't fix it, you just ended it
When we remember
We only get a version of
The last time we remember it
And as time rolls on like it always does
Though it might be a little different
I won't forget
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing

Just two kids
When you pulled me out
We never really spoke
But I still saw you around
Friends of friends
What does that mean to you now
I heard everybody came
When they put you in the ground7Embed
