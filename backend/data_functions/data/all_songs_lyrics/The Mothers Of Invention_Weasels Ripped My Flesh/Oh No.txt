Oh No LyricsOh no, I don't believe it
You say that you think you know the meaning of love
You say love is all we need
You say with your love you can change
All of the fools, all of the hate
I think you're probably out to lunch
Oh no, I don't believe it
You say that you think you know the meaning of love
Do you really think it can be told?
You say that you really know
I think you should check it again
How can you say what you believe
Will be the key to a world of love?
All your love
Will it save me?
All your love
Will it save the world
From what we can't understand?
Oh no, I don't believe it
And in your dreams
You can see yourself as a prophet saving the world
The words from your lips
I just can't believe you are such a foolEmbed
