You Rope, You Tie Me LyricsDon't stand in my way
Let me pass
Easy
Don't try to block, trip
Or check my baby
No counter action
Gonna handicap me baby
You know I'm travelling light
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're a lion in my path
In my light
'Scuse me
Don't upset
Don't embarrass me baby
Don't show your body
You're body don't make it
You know I'm moving on right
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know we started out good
We were in love with all the world
All of a sudden
It was out of control
I started to lie
'Cos you couldn't see the truth
Oh what a sad world
You get too jealous
You patronise me
Let me get away
You get too jealous
You drive me crazy
Let me get away
Let me get away
Don't stand in my way
In my light
'Scuse me
You get too jealous
You patronise me
You get too jealous
You drive me crazy
You get too jealous
You rope you tie me
You get too jealous
I need to be free
Let me get awayEmbed
