Wishing LyricsI saw a star
Falling
Like an old
Hollywood actress
A neon sign
With just one letter showing
A burned out light
At my feet
I took a wish
I wished on that jewel
From the sky
I wished on the moon
Haunting the trees
A target too big for the sky
I wanted it so bad
I was wishing on a prayer
But it kept right on dodging
A riderless horse
To the left, to the right
Straight to the eye
Yet changing direction
There within reach
And then out of sight
I'd waited too long
Watched for that pot to boil
Waited too long for the whistle
I wanted it so bad
I was wishing on a prayer
But it kept right on dodging
A riderless horse
To the left, to the right
Straight to the eye
Yet changing direction
There within reach
And then out of sightEmbed
