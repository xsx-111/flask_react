Taking My Baby Up Town LyricsI was walking down the street
Looking like a million dollars
With a pretty person on my arm
When someone started shouting
They were hooting and a hollering
They were saying I should
Never have been born
I said baby you hear that
You're listening to the voices of fools
I said baby let me tell you
What they're trying to do
They're trying to make our love
A thing of the past
But I said a-ha
There very next day
It was early in the morning
The sun was shining on my back
I was feeling pretty rested
The air smelt good
And I forgot about
The thing in the park
When they walked up
Then they passed me
You know I didn't want to turn my head
But they started up again
And those silly voices rang
And the clanging was
Too much for my brain
But I said a-ha
What we've got is the best
It was Friday I had money
I was feeling kind of special
I was taking my baby up town
The moon was high
The stars were bright
And there were lots of people in the street
I held your hand
And you kissed me
And then all the people started to stare
We started a commotion
Someone making comments
Morals, the state of affairs
And I said
What we got is the bestEmbed
