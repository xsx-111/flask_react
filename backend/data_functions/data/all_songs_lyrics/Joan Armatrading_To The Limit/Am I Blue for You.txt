Am I Blue for You LyricsI haven't slept
On over eighteen hours
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Won't rest my head
Till that day
You are back by my side
Oh darling I remember
When we drank the wine
When we talked
When we talked
Made no sense at all
Oh darling
I have found out
Now this haze in gone
That I need your coolness
To keep me alive
Oh baby what am I to do
Get down on my knees
My body aches
And my eyes feel tired
Am I blue for you
Oh darling I remember
When the good feeling was there
How we laughed
How we laughed
Those times are on my mind
Oh darling
I have found out
Now this crazy feeling is gone
That I need your loving
It keeps me alive
I ain't had no love
In all this time
You are there on my mind
Oh baby
What am I to do
I shall soon be cryingEmbed
