Baby I LyricsRemember when you took me
Out last night
It was a clear night
The nearest moon
I'd ever seen
Filled the sky
Threw light on the city
Remember when you took me
To some party
With your arms around my waist
Planning my weekends
Maybe planning
To change my name
I'm in love
And I got to let you know
Baby I
Want to be
In your loving arms again
Baby I
Want to be
In your loving arms again
Feel you near to me
Baby, ah can't you see
So much
Romance in the air
And all I really want
Is to be with youEmbed
