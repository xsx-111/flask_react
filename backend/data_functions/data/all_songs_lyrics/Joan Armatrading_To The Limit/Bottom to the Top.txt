Bottom to the Top LyricsKnow I've been saying
There's something I have to prove
I keep on going baby
'Cos if I stop now
I'm bound to lose
To the limit here we go
From the bottom to the top
Gonna tell all of my friends
Say I can run on any track
Some move more quickly
You now they can stand the pace
Others move slow
But they get there just the same
Know I want first
And not just a place
Keep on pushing babe
Know I've been working
To do what I have to do
Keep on pushing baby
'Cos I know if I get through
It's more for you
To the limit here we go
From the bottom to the top
Gonna tell all of my friends
Say I can run on any track
Some move more quickly
You now they can stand the pace
Others move slow
But they get there just the same
I know I want first
And not just a place
Keep on pushing babe
To the limit here we go
Nice and easy do it
Nice and easyEmbed
