Your Letter LyricsI read your letter yesterday
If fell between the covers
And my bare skin
It fell between my crying
And my longing for you
I loved this one
Too long
This one much to much
Sometimes I gave just enough of myself
But most times nothing at all
And you've been gone
Too long
You know I love you the best
You call me crazy
That's how you won my heart
'Cos you were half crazy too
I read your letter again today
Out loud
And to myself
It gave me back my sanity
I didn't feel so alone
Won't be too soon
Not like the night
Not like the night on a summer's day
Can't wait to see you step across the room
Empty room
Save you and me
I feel your touches in your letters
But it's not half as good as you touching me
