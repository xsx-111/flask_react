What Do You Want LyricsWhat do you want
What do you want
You're messing up everybody else
By being so cool
What is it you need
What is it mmm
You confuse a lot of people's minds
By being undecided
Said you loved me once
The way you made me feel
Now why does it hurt so bad
Oh baby please don't go
I'm begging you to stay
You know that breaking up
Is so sad
Where do you go
Who do you now
There's a face
I can't recall
And I'm wary of most strangers
Am I the fool
Have you blinded me
You're breaking up a heart
So bad but the bruise
Draws out real slow
Said you loved me once
The way you made me feel
Now why does it hurt so bad
Oh baby please don't go
I'm begging you to stay
You know that breaking up
Is so sad
Oh baby please don't goEmbed
