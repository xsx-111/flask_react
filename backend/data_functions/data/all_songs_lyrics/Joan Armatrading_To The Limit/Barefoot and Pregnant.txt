Barefoot and Pregnant LyricsSo many ladies love you
With the innocence of a child
Child who believes in God
You keep 'em in luxury
But it's a luxury in the dark
You walk around
With a smile upon your face
But there's something
That you don't know
You're luck's run out
And it's a time for you to go
Everybody told me I was crazy
To try to tame such a wild one
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I got myself into this thing
Like I never knew I could and now
I gotta get away just as fast as I can
I got myself into this thing
And I'll find a way out
You gave me babies
To you that proves your love
Tie my hands with jewels
Barefoot and pregnant you kept me
You sought to
Hide me from the truth
But your lady's gone and bought some shoes
And she's stepping out on the town
Your lady took herself in hand
And she's spreading herself around
I wanted your love
But not at any price
You're just the hurting kind
Say you want me for yourself
But your deeds deny itEmbed
