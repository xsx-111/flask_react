Lighthouse LyricsI never meant this
I never meant anything like this
And that's the story
I never met anyone like you
Come to me
And make it special
Come to me
And make it real
Come to me and make it special
Come to me and make me feel
Shine your bright light over me
And help me see
I walked on water
I came through slaughter just for you
Come to me
And make it special
Come to me
And make it real
Come to me and make it special
Come to me and make me feel
Shine your bright light over me
Lay your dreaming at my feet
The heartbreak notes
And the laboured jokes
The trashy years
And the random tears
The love and endings
The almost starts
The love and endings
The tell-tale art
Follow me down to where I'll always beEmbed
