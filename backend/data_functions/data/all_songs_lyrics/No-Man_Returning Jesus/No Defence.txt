No Defence LyricsYou have climbed
And the climb left you blind
Too much to think about
Too little to do
But you pull through
You always pull through
It goes slow
Answer questions you don't want to know
Too much to think about
Too little, it's true
But you pull through
You always pull through
No defense against the pounds
And against the pence
Love it all
No defense
The voice that left the ladies moist
Is running out of choice
Losing pace and losing poise
Losing out to some awful noise
Sleep awake
Sleep awake for now
No defense against the pounds
And against the pence
Love it all
No defense
No disgrace
To close your eyes and to quit the chase
Love it all
No disgraceEmbed
