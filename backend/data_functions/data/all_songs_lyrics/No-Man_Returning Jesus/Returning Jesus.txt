Returning Jesus LyricsSlow it all down, slow it all down, it always moves so fast
Slow it all down, slow it all down, it always moves too fast
Follow me down, follow me down, to where I'll always be
Follow me down, follow me down, to where I'll always be
I don't want to stay a million miles away, a million miles away
I don't want to stay a million miles away, a million miles awayEmbed
