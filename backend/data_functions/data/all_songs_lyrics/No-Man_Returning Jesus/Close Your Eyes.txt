Close Your Eyes LyricsHis hands were hard
Your face was soft
He kissed your heavy head
And then you lost your strength
Now, nothing shows
You're empty now
He kissed your heavy head
And then you lost it
(chorus:)
Close your eyes to the world
Close your eyes
Dive in deep for the pearl
You shine your torch
Into the sky
You watch the darkness grow
It makes you want to cry
(chorus x2)
His hands were hard
Your face was soft
He kissed your heavy head
And then you lost your strength
You break like a child
Like a child you break
You swim alone
Like a childEmbed
