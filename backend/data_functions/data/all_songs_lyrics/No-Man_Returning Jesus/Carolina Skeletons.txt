Carolina Skeletons LyricsCowboy kate came too late
She'll never see the dawn
Cowboy kate came too late
She'll never face the sun
The love goes by and the life runs dry
Pulls the tinsel from her hair
She loses sight in the velvet night
Drops a tin can by the chair
(chorus:)
Through all the tiny victories and the big defeats
It's carolina skeletons that keep her rooted to her seat
Cowboy kate came too late
She'll never read the signs
Cowboy kate came too late
She'll never have the time
The love goes by and the life runs dry
Pulls the tinsel from her hair
She dreams of flight in the velvet night
Throws a tin can in the air
(chorus)
Through all the tiny victories and the big defeats
It's carolina skeletons that keep her rooted to her seat
(chorus 2:)
Through all the shitty obstacles and all the words so sweet
It's carolina skeletons that make her stranger when she eatsEmbed
