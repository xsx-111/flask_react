Outside the Machine LyricsI'm tired, I'm cold
Untied and feeling old
You're all lit up like catherine wheels
You're all lit up, but you're not real
I don't need you
Not like I used to do
I don't need you
Not like I did
Hate confusion, need advice
Love illusion, need advice
What does it mean to be a part of you?
How does it feel inside the heart of you?
I don't need you
Not like I used to do
I don't need you
Not like I did
Outside the machine
Left alone with my dreams
Outside the machine
All lit up, somebody screams
What does it mean to be a part of you?
Tried to get inside the very heart of youEmbed
