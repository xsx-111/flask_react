Sonic Attack LyricsIn case of Sonic Attack on your district
Follow these rules
If you are making love, it is imperative to bring all bodies to orgasm simultaneously
Do not waste time blocking your ears
Do not waste time seeking a soundproof shelter
Try to get as far away from the sonic source as possible
Do not panic
(Do not panic)
Use your wheels, it is what they are for
Small babies may be placed inside the special cocoons and should be left, if possible, in shelters
Do not attempt to use your own limbs
If no wheels are available metal, not organic, limbs should be employed whenever possible
Remember, in the case of Sonic Attack, survival means every man for himself
(Himself)
Statistically more people survive if they think only of themselves
(Only themselves)
Do not attempt to rescue friends, relatives, loved ones
You have only a few seconds to escape use those seconds sensibly or you will inevitably die
Do not panic
(Do not panic)
Think only of yourself
(Only yourself)
Think only of yourself
(Only yourself)
These are the first signs of Sonic Attack:
You will notice small objects, such as ornaments, oscillating
You will notice vibrations in your diaphragm
You will hear a distant hissing in your ears
You will feel dizzy
You will feel the need to vomit
There will be bleeding from orifices
There will be an ache in the pelvic region
You may be subject to fits of hysterical shouting
Or even laughter
These are all sign of imminent Sonic destruction
Your only protection is flight
If you are less than ten years old remain in the shelters and use your cocoon
Remember: you can help no-one else
(No-one else)
You can help no-one else
(No-one else)
Do not panic
(Do not panic)
Do not panic
(Do not panic)
Think only of yourself
(Only yourself)
Think only of yourself
(Only of yourself)
Think only of yourself
(Only yourself)
Think only of yourselfEmbed
