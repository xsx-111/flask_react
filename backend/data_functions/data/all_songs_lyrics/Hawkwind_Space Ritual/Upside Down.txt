Upside Down LyricsWhen I stand upside down
Can't get a thing together and I don't know why
Oh dear, you look so good
Don't you think it's heaven like you knew you would?
Oh dear what shall I do?
I think that there's a reason but it's up to you
I stand upside down
Can't get a thing together and I don't know why
You know you look so fine
Can't get a thing together and I don't know why
I stand upside down
Can't get a thing together and I don't know why
Oh dear what shall I do?
I think that there's a reason but it's up to you
I stand upside down
Can't get a thing together and I don't know whyEmbed
