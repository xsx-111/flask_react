Orgone Accumulator LyricsI've got an orgone accumulator
And it makes me feel greater
I'll see you sometime later
When I'm through with my accumulator
It's no social integrator
It's a one man isolator
It's a back brain stimulator
It's a cerebral vibrator
Of orgones
It's made out of orgones
Energy stimulators
Just turn your eyeballs into craters
But an orgone accumulator
Is a superman creator
It's no social integrator
It's a one man isolator
It's a back brain stimulator
A cerebral vibrator
Of orgones
Of orgones
Orgones
I've got an orgone accumulator
And it makes me feel greater
I will see you sometime later
When I'm through with my accumulator
It's no social integrator
It's a one man isolator
It's a back brain stimulator
A cerebral vibrator
Of orgones
Of orgones
Of orgones
It's all gone
It's all gone
It's orgones
It's orgonesEmbed
