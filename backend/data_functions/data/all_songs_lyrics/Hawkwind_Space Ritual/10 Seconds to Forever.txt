10 Seconds to Forever LyricsIn the tenth second of forever
I thought of the sea and a white yacht drifting
In the ninth second of forever
I thought of a leaf, a stone, a plastic fragment of a child's toy
In the eighth second of forever
I remembered a warm room where voices played
In the seventh second of forever
I thought of the life I would not lead
In the sixth second of forever
I saw your mouth whispering something I could not hear
In the fifth second of forever
I thought of the vermillion deserts of Mars, the jeweled forests of Venus
In the fourth second of forever
I could remember nothing that I did not love
In the third second of forever
I thought of rain against a window, I thought of the wind
In the second second of forever
I thought of a pair of broken shades lying on the tarmac
In the first and final second of forever
I thought of the long past that had led to now
And never...
Never...
Never...Embed
