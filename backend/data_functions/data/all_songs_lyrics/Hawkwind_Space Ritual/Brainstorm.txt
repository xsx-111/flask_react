Brainstorm LyricsStanding on the runway waiting to take-off
I wanna fly, wanna watch me flake off
I can't move 'cause the man has the brake on
You gotta help me, help me to shake off
This body of mine – I've gotta get out of this void
Body of mine – 'cause I don't wanna be destroyed
Body of mine – and I don't wanna turn android
Body of mine – you gotta help me avoid that
Brainstorm – here I go
Brainstorm – flying low
Brainstorm – I'm gonna miss it
Brainstorm – you bet I'd kiss it
Can't get no peace 'til I get into motion
Sign my release from this planet's erosion
Paranoia police have sussed out my potion
You gotta help me or there'll be an explosion
In this body of mine – I've gotta get out of this void
Body of mine – 'cause I don't wanna be destroyed
Body of mine – and I don't wanna turn android
Body of mine – you gotta help me avoid that
Brainstorm – here I go
Brainstorm – flying low
Brainstorm – I'm gonna miss it
Brainstorm – you bet I'd kiss it
I'm breaking up
I'm falling apart
I'm floating away
Can't get no peace 'til I get into motion
Sign my release from this planet's erosion
Paranoia police have sussed out my potion
You gotta help me or there'll be an explosion
In this body of mine – I've gotta get out of this void
Body of mine – 'cause I don't wanna be destroyed
Body of mine – and I don't wanna turn android
Body of mine – you gotta help me avoid that
Brainstorm – here I go
Brainstorm – flying low
Brainstorm – I'm gonna miss it
Brainstorm – you bet I'd kiss it
I'm breaking up, man
I'm floating again
I'm floating awayEmbed
