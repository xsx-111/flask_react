Never Never Land Lyrics
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

I know a place where dreams are born
And time is never planned
It's not on any chart
You must find it in your heart
Never Never Land

It may be miles beyond the moon
Or right there where you stand
Just keep an open mind
And then suddenly you'll find
Never Never Land

You'll have a treasure if you stay there
More precious far than gold
For once you have found your way there
You will never, never grow old

And that's my home where dreams are born
And time is never planned
Just think of pleasant things
And your heart will fly on wings, forever
In Never Never LandEmbed
