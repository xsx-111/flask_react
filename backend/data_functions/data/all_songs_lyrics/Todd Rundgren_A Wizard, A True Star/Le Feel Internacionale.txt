Le Feel Internacionale Lyrics
Everyone is mine
No one left behind
And there's more (And there's more)
Wait another year
Utopia is here
And there's always more

There is more international feel
And there's more interplanetary deals
Still there's more interstellar appeal
There is more universal ideal
There is more international feelEmbed
