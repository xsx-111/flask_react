International Feel Lyrics
Here we are again
The start of the end
But there's more
(But there's more)
I only want to see
If you'll give up on me
But there's always more

(There is more) International feel
(And there is more) Interplanetary deals
(But there is more) Interstellar appeal
(Still there is more) Universal ideal
(Still there is more) International feel
(Always more)

I swear something lies
In your ears and your eyes
'Cause there's more
('Cause there's more)
You hear and you see
Yet you do not believe
That there's always more
(There is more) International feel
(And there is more) Interplanetary deals
(But there is more) Interstellar appeal
(Still there is more) Universal ideal
(Still there is more) International feel

(I know, I know)...Embed
