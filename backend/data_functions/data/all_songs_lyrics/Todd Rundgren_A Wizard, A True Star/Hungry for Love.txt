Hungry for Love Lyrics
Mom's old fashion cooking
Caviar and champagne
A meal at McDonald's
Nothing fills a man when he's hungry for love

Give him love, make him feel all right
Give him love, help him sleep at night
Give him love, give him one more bite
He's hungry for love, give him that
Wooh!

An ounce of sweet Jamaican
A snowy spoon of powder
A half a pint of Bushmill's
Nothing gets you high when you're hungry for love

Give me love, make me feel all right
Give me love, help me sleep at night
Give me love, give me one more bite
I'm hungry for love, give me love, give me love
Wooh!
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin'
Give me love, give me love


Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme some lovin'Embed
