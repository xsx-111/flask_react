Does Anybody Love You? Lyrics
Talk, you can talk, but if you ask me take
All your big words and put them together
What good will they do
When the long day is through

Does anybody love you?
Do you think that anybody's in love with-

You can dress up or dress down as you
Gaze in the mirror, hung up on your body
What good can it be
When there's no one there to see

Does anybody love you?
Do you think that anybody's in love with you

You're so lovely, so wise
You could make Venus crawl
But love between the ugly
Is the most beautiful love of all
Does anybody love you?
Do you think that anybody's in love with you
Is anybody, anybody in love with you?Embed
