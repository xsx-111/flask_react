Is It My Name? Lyrics
There is cause and effect
There's a reason I'm so erect
There's last night, there's today
There's a reason you feel this way

Is it my name?
Is it my name?
Is it my name?
Don't miss the boat baby, don't miss the plane
I don't think I can play this scene again

Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?
Is it my name?

All the lies, all the truth
All the things that I offer you
All the sights, all the sounds
All the times that you turn me down

Is it my name?
Is it my name?
Is it my name?
My voice goes so high you would think I was gay
But I play my guitar in such a man-cock way
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love me?
It is my name?


Is it my name?
Is it my name?
Is it my name?
Why don't you love me? For my machine
You only love me for my machine
You only love me for my machine
You only love me for my machine
You only love me for my machine
You only love me for my machine
You only love me for my machine
You only love me for my machine
You only love me for my machine
You only love me for my machineEmbed
