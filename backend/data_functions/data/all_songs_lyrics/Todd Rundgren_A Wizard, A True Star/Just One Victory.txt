Just One Victory Lyrics
We've been waiting so long
We've been waiting so long
We've been waiting for the sun to rise and shine
Shining still to give us the will

Can you hear me, the sound of my voice?
I am here to tell you I have made my choice
I've been listening to what's been going down
There's just too much talk and gossip going 'round

You may think that I'm a fool, but I know the answer
Words become a tool, anyone can use them
Take the golden rule as the best example
Eyes that have seen will know what I mean

The time has come to take the bull by the horns
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
We've been so downhearted, we've been so forlorn
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
We get weak and we want to give in
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
But we still need each other if we want to win
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
If you don't know what to do about a world of trouble
You can pull it through if you need to and if
You believe it's true, it will surely happen
Shining still, to give us the will

We've been waiting so long
We've been waiting so long
We've been waiting for the sun to rise and shine
Shining still to give us the will
Bright as the day, to show us the way

Somehow, someday
We need just one victory and we're on our way
Prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night
Give us just one victory, it will be all right

We may feel about to fall but we'll go down fighting
You will hear the call if you only listen
Underneath it all we are here together
Shining still to give us the will
Bright as the day, to show us the way
Somehow, someday
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
We need just one victory and we're on our way
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
Prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
Give us just one victory, it will be all right
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
Somehow, someday
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
Give us just one victory and we're on our way
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
Prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
Give us just one victory, it will be all right
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
Somehow, someday
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
Give us just one victory and we're on our way
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
Prayin' for it all day and fightin' for it all night
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
Give us just one victory, it will be all right
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line)
Somehow, someday
(Hold that line, baby hold that line, get up boys and hit 'em one more time)
Give us just one victory and we're on our way...
(We may be losing now but we can't stop trying, so hold that line, baby hold that line...)1Embed
