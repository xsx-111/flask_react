You Need Your Head Lyrics
You don't need your feet
'Cause you know you got wheels
You don't need your hands
'Cause you know how it feels
You don't need your eyes
'Cause you know how she looks
You don't need your tongue
'Cause you know how she cooks

But you need your head
You need your head
You need your head

You don't need your belly
'Cause there's nothing to eat
You don't need your heart
'Cause it just can't be beat
You don't need your mouth
'Cause you talk too much
You don't need your crotch
Ah you know it's only a crutch

But you need your head
You need your head - every day, every day
You need your head

You need your head
You need your head
You need your head
You need your headEmbed
