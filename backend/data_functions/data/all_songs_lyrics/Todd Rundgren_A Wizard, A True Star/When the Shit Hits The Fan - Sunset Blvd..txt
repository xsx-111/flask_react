When the Shit Hits The Fan / Sunset Blvd. Lyrics
Earthquake in New York City
The Chrysler Building fell in my yard
But when the shit hits the fan
I think I'll have to make my way

Back to Sunset Boulevard
Sunset Boulevard
Ooooh

The IRA has just hit London
They blew up half of Scotland Yard
But when the shit hits the fan
I guess I'll try to make my way

Back to Sunset Boulevard
Sunset Boulevard
Ooooh


Cruisin' down a mountain highway
Someone's cut the brakes on my car
But when the shit hits the fan
I know I got to get my ass back to-1Embed
