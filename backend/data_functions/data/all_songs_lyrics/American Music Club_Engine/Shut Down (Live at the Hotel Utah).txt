Shut Down (Live at the Hotel Utah) LyricsAs her mind shuts down she begins to cry
Oh, releasing everything she wanted
Too a big, indifferent sky
I remember, mmm I remember, I forget
Her hands are shaking and she's terrified
And I try to take them but I'm not like the sky
Yeah, I remember, mmm I remember, I forget
I remember, I remember, I forget, I forgеt
As her mind shuts down she begins to cry
Just likе any star that you ever wished onEmbed
