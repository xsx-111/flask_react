Art of Love LyricsWe're on a magic carpet ride
Now, we perfected the art of love
We perfected the art of love
We perfected the art of love
Well now all the lights shine on me and misery
My girlfriend friend misery
My friend M-I-S-R-E
You, you can be cured by a single touch
You can be cured by a single touch
You can get up and walk away
Oh, anything you say
Yeah, anything that you say
Oh, anything you say
Yeah, anything you say
We'll drive to the end of the road again
To the end of the road again
Oh, to the end of the road again
'Cause I'll be your only friend
Right before we touch the ground
Right before we touch the ground
Well make a sweet loving sound
Sweet loving sound
Plush loving sound
Sweet loving sound
Sweet loving soundEmbed
