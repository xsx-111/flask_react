Big Night LyricsBig nights are black and blue
They get cold and they get wet
And they're calling out for you
Like no one you ever met
No one dreams in the hours around me
The more I lose the more you find me
I lose track with every kiss
We shouldn't be isolated like this
Yeah, you're my friend
And when we're lost I'll still hold your hand
Revealed in white when the shadows fell
In any shadow that you can name
I'll be the shadow of your name
Hold the prize close to your heart
The prize is made for those who failed
Hold the prize away from you
So maybe you can hold me as well
When time peels off your statue skin
I'll still be fooled by what remains
Yeah, whatever's left of you will be my dream
Yeah, you're my friend
And when we're drunk I still hold your hand
Revealed in white when the shadows fell
In any shadow that you can name
I'll be the shadow of your name
In any shadow that you name
I'll be the shadow of the name
I'll be the shadow of your nameEmbed
