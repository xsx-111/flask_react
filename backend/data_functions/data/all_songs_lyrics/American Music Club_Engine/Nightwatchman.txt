Nightwatchman LyricsI remember how I let you down
Everything you say reminds me of the pain
How you lost your dignity
Passing in and out of a dream
Is there some secret I'm supposed to know?
Is there some secret I always miss?
'Cause there's no dignity when you have to live
When you have to live within the boundaries of a kiss
And the nightwatchman, yeah, he's asleep
Nightwatchman, I can't wake him up
Watchman, oh come on, tell me what's wrong
Nightwatchman, is the night too long?
Is the same lie you gave me before?
I don't care, anything you say is just fine
I'll just sit and watch the traffic passing by outside
Oh, the will in the world it's the prevailing tide
You're supposed to watch the night as it passes by
You're never supposed to need anyone
'Cause once I knew the secret to happiness
I knew it once, oh but now it's gone
And the nightwatchman, yeah he's asleep
Nightwatchman, I can't wake him up
Watchman, oh c'mon, tell me what's wrong
Nightwatchman, is the night too long?
Is the night too long?
Is the night too long?
Is the night too long?
Is the night too long?Embed
