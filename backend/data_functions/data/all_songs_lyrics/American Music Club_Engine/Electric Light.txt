Electric Light LyricsYou got me good
You did the right thing
And nothing matters
Everything's understood
You did the right thing
Are you gonna be my judge and jury tonight?
'Cause I'm busy baby with the electric light
I'm not afraid of it I want you, want you
C'mon tell me the truth
I was just a little bit lonely and that's not a crime
I was crying, I was crying for the very last time
I was caught blind staring into your electric light
Yeah, but I'm never going back, oh back again
No, I'm never gonna go, oh back again
Electric moon, oh, straight jacket moon
You can see me down here, can't you?
Oh, and it's not a very pretty sight
I can see pretty face, oh, that you're raped every night
Oh, and it's all plain as day in the electric light
Yeah, but I'm never going back again
No, No, No, I'm never gonna go back againEmbed
