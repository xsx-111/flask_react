Clouds LyricsStorm picks up valuable things, places mirrors at my feet
A wardrobe filled with blood and nasty lies to repeat
Well let me give you something, 'cause everything's for free
Yeah, let me give you something before you take it from me
With a magic finger I'll smooth the lines on your face
And no bad feelings linger but your disgust and my disgrace
You wanna get excited so I'll push you too far
You wanna get excited, that's too bad
Here they come
They've got shotguns and transparent skin
They will stand around like rain
And they all, they want in
So come on in, yeah welcome in
Storm picks up valuable things, places mirrors at my feet
A wardrobe filled with blood and nasty lies to repeat
You wanna get excited so I'll push you too far
You wanna get excited, that's just too bad
Here they come
They've got shotguns and transparent skin
And they will stand around like rain
And they all, they want in
So come on in, yeah welcome in
Here they come
Tell me how you know my nameEmbed
