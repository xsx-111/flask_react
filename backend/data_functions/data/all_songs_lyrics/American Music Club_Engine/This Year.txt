This Year LyricsThis year, this year
Oh, what's the look this year?
Is it the look of things to come?
Has it all been said, has it all been done?
The sun upon the sea, did you dress that way for me?
This year, this year
Everyone just stood around
And watched my family tree burn down
Watched it crumble on the ground
Making no protesting sound
As if justice was finally found
And anything beautiful
That you can contrive
Has no desire to survive, to survive
This year, this year the mirror on the wall
It cracked right through the middle
And spring turned into fall
Love is the most beautiful killer of them allEmbed
