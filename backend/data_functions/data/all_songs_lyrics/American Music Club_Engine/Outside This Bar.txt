Outside This Bar LyricsThe hospital wouldn't admit you
So we go home again
Right back to the same old room
Right back to the same old thing
But you know you're just another girl
Came from some carry-out in hell
You're just another story how they fucked up the life
Of a sweet girl
We'll sit on an empty street
Watch the El Dorados roll by
You can't look your murderers
You can't look them in the eye
But you know they can always spot you
From a mile away
They give you anything you want
They'll do anything you say
And outside this bar there's no one alive
Yeah, outside this bar how does anyone survive
Together you and me, you know we've gotta destroy this world
Come on darling, we've gotta destroy this world
And I remember when
Your girlfriend would put you on display
You'd be the life of the party
'Till they come and drag you away
But in the end we'll watch the pattern
As it begins to tear
We'll see the chaos that's underneath
All the clothes that the angels wear
And outside this bar there's no one alive
Yeah, outside this bar how does anyone survive?
Together you and me, you know we'll never destroy this world
Yeah, come on baby I wish we could destroy this world
Oh outside this bar
Yeah, outside this bar
Together you and me turn this quiet night into silence
Together we'll turn this love into violenceEmbed
