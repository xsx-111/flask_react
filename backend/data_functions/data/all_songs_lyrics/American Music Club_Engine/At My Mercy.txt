At My Mercy LyricsI hold your dress, your dress is blue
I'm a coin that fell into the sea
Now stumbling around, I'm lost from view
Do you know what became of me?
He can see with his eyes closed
He'll leave you something to remember him by
Valentine said no way out
No way out and no goodbye
Now you're finally at my mercy (Now you're finally at my mercy)
Now you're at my beck and call (Now you're at my beck and call)
You were born with just one kiss
That's all it took, that's all it took, that's all it took
Oh that's all
He only comes to this bar when he gets desperate
He's been shot and killed by love
Sits at a bar thinks about all those angels in heaven
And offer 'em to the overpass above
I hold your dress, your dress is blue
Oh, I am a coin that fell into the sea
Stumbling around but now I'm lost from view
On the losing side of eternity
Now you're finally at my mercy (Now you're finally at my mercy)
Now you're at my beck and call (Now you're at my beck and call)
You were born with just one kiss
And that's all it took, that's all it took, that's all it took
Oh that's all, that's all
That's all, that's all, that's allEmbed
