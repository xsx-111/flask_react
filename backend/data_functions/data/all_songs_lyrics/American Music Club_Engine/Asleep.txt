Asleep LyricsYou be child
Close, close your eyes and smile
I like to see you that way
I wish you would stay that way
Here I come on my bed of nails in the sky
A pretty, like new, and expensive waiting room
I like to see your city lights all spread around
A cheap version of the sky on the ground
I like to see you sleeping
I like to see you that way
I wish that you would just sleep all day
Yeah, sleep all dayEmbed
