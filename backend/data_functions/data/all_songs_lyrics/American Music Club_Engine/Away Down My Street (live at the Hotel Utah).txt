Away Down My Street (live at the Hotel Utah) LyricsI'll sit inside today, emptying a bottle
Plugging up my brain
Killing off my hopes
I'm an idiot
Shoot 'em down like they're flies
Yeah, you and me both, we live in a land we don't belong
And the clothes we wear, they always tear
Those second-hand clothes, they always tear
Those second-hand hopes, they always tear
Away down my street (away down my street)
Away down my street (away down my street)
I walk, I walk, the sun's a prize for my weak eyes
I put my blindfold on (away down my street)
How do I get out of here?
Move along Joe, move along Jack
The burning road it wants you back
I'm high enough now to feel satisfied
I'm satisfied now to feel nothing at all
I'm nothing at all, I feel satisfied
I'm satisfied now with jewels on a chain
We're empty as hell, we're jewels on a chain
Away down my street (away down my street)
Away down my street (away down my street)
I walk, I walk, the sun's a prize for my weak eyes
I put my blindfold on (away down my street)
How do I get out of here?
Hey, go on man, I put my blindfold on
Hey, come on man, how do I get out of here?
Hey, come on man, hey garbage man
I'm in garbage land, how do I get out of here?Embed
