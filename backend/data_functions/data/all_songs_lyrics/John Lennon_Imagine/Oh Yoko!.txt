Oh Yoko! Lyrics
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, I call your name

Oh Yoko
Oh Yoko
My love will turn you on

In the middle of a bath
In the middle of a bath, I call your name

Oh Yoko
Oh Yoko
My love will turn you on
My love will turn you on

In the middle of a shave
In the middle of a shave, I call your name

Oh Yoko
Oh Yoko
My love will turn you on
In the middle of a dream
In the middle of a dream, I call your name

Oh Yoko
Oh Yoko
My love will turn you on
My love will turn you on

In the middle of a cloud
In the middle of a cloud, I call your name

Oh Yoko
Oh Yoko
My love will turn you on
Oh Yoko
Oh Yoko
Oh Yoko
