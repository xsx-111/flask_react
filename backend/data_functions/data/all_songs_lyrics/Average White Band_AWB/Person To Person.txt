Person To Person LyricsTelephone line, bad connection
And I'm half asleep
Makin' conversation with you should be easy
But it ain't
Wish you could be with me
There would be no problem
Our communication's bad
And I want to see you again
Person to person, face to face
Person to person, one to one
Person to person, touching hands
Person to person, that's what love demands
Six weeks, long time to be without you sugar
But what can I do
Working hard on the other side of the world
Might as well be on the moon
Wish that I could write it all down
And put it in a letter to you
Feelin' like I do right now
Won't make it any better to you
Just got to be
Person to person, face to face
Person to person, one to one
Person to person, we can't replace
Person to person, that's just how it gets done
Person to person, line to line
Person to person, just keepin' timeEmbed
