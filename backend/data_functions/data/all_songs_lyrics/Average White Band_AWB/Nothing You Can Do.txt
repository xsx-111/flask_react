Nothing You Can Do LyricsE Em Am
It's real, you know you're with me all the time

No one can steal your love

You gotta realize they won't get far

Nothing you can do could make me
C
Stop lovin' you baby
Nothing you can say
Could make me break away
You're mine, but I can't do a thing about it
It takes time to get there
And I just wanna sing about it to ya, yeah
I can't give you up
No, not without a fight
Don't wanna let it up
Just got to hang in tight
C'mon fill me up
With your sweet, sweet lovin'
You got to set me up
Ain't no use in runnin'
'Cause there's nothing you can do
Could make me stop lovin' you baby
Nothing you can say
Could make me break awayEmbed
