Just Wanna Love You Tonight LyricsI've got one evening left before I go
Don't want to spend it one my own
This time tomorrow I'll be on the road
So I got to get on the telephone
I need to see you girl, before I go away
Just got to have your love to remember
Your precious company, ooh
That's what I need today
I won't be back until September
You give me pleasure like I never had
I guess you know just what I like
Even if I'm not your only man
You make me feel as if I am
So tonight I want to have you to myself
'Cause I'm leaving in the morning light
Don't want you running to no one else
Just wanna love you tonight
There is a saying you better not forget
It's always come true for me
They say that what you see is what you get
And woman, you're all that I can see
That's why I'm asking you, oh just try and
Understand me, baby
This ain't time for silly games
And I'm a desperate man, can't you hear it in my voice
Without your love I just wouldn't be the same
So I'm putting my heart out to you, my love
Doing everything within my power
Now I've done my best - did I hear you say yes
I'll be round at your door within the hour
'Cause tonight I want to have you to myself
I'm leaving in the morning light
Don't want you running to no one else
Just wanna love you tonightEmbed
