Got The Love LyricsBabe, you been gone such a long time
I've been thinkin' 'bout what it is we've got
Not all the time in the world, but we got a lot
There is much, much more than a ghost of a chance
We can make it right this time
'Cause you've got to stay mine
Got the love
Got to make it work on you
Got the love
Just can't keep it hid
You might not think that I care at all, But I do
You know me so much better than anyone else
It should be easy to convince you that I got the love
Got the love
Got to make it work on you
Got the love
Just can't keep it hid
So come on girl, let's work it out
C'mon and take my hand
'Cause I got the love
Got the love
Got to make it work on you
Got the love
Just can't keep it hidEmbed
