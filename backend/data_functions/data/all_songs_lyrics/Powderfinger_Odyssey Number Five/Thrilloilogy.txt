Thrilloilogy Lyrics
For every story gone untold
There's a secret that dissolves
So many pieces still unsolved
You're not quite who you think you are
Can see the symptoms from afar
I'm hosing down your shooting star

There you go again to fall
Waiting on a friend to call

If you wait I'm gonna drive it home
(Carry all of this away from here)
If you wait I'm gonna drive it home
(Kiss you every time the rains appear)

Sometimes we wish for far away
But something always makes me stay
It's far too strong a bond to try and break
You know exactly where you've been
The shooting star is hardly seen
Outshined by every other beam
There you go again to fall
Waiting on a friend to call

If you wait I'm gonna drive it home
(Carry all of this away from here)
If you wait I'm gonna drive it home
(Kiss you every time the rains appear)
If you wait I'm gonna drive it home
(I'm feeling richer I'm feeling taller)
(I feel like every time I try to fit the picture)
If you wait I'm gonna drive it home
(I've got to keep up with all the others)
(Looking for whatever we were never to discover)


Now you're ringing out slowly
Like cathedral bells
And you'd sleep through heaven
Just to get to hell
Now you drop away slowly
Like the autumn leaves
But you lose your colour
When you hit the street
When you hit the street
When you hit the street, yeahEmbed
