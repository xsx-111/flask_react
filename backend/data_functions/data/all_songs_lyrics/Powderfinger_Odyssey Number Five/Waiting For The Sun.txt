Waiting For The Sun Lyrics
This will be an uncertain time for us, my love
I can hear the echo of your voice in my head
Singing, my love

I can see your face there in my hands, my love
I have been blessed by your grace and care, my love
Singing, my love

There's a place for us
Sitting here, waiting for the sun
And it calls me back
Into the safe arms that I know

For every step you're further away from me, my love
I grow more unsteady on my feet, my love
Singing, my love

There's a place for us
Sitting here, waiting for the sun
And it calls me back
Into the safe arms that I know
There's a place for us
Sitting here, waiting for the sun
And it calls me back
Into the safe arms that I know
For every step you're further away from me, my love
I grow more unsteady on my feet, oh now

There's a place for us
Sitting here, waiting for the sun
And it calls me back
Into the safe arms that I know

Now we're waiting for the sun
Yeah, we're waiting for the sunEmbed
