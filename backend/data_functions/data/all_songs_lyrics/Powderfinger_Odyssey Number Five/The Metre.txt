The Metre LyricsBlow the candles out
Raise a glass to the night
Let all the tension out
You've been wound up so tight
It's a tender trap to plan ahead all the time
If you measure the world by what you leave behind
Welcome to the saving grace
Welcome to the saving grace
Theres a sunset on the road
Reappearing as we go
Keep the glass topped up
It's not over just yet
Lock the social bluff
Celebrate your success
Turn the sunlight out
Find a place in the shade
If you measure the world by the mark that you've made
Welcome to the saving grace
Welcome to the saving grace
Theres a sunset on the road
Reappearing as we go
If you measure the world by what you leave behind
Welcome to the saving grace
Welcome to the saving grace
Theres a sunset on the road
Reappearing as we go
Reappearing as we go
Reappearing as we go
Theres a sunset on the road
Welcome to the saving graceEmbed
