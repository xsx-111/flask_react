These Days Lyrics
It's coming 'round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
Soon enough it comes
And settles in its place
Its shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day

This life, well, it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

It's coming 'round again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
It settles in its place
It's shadow in my face
Puts pressure in my day

Soon enough it comes
Here it is again
The slowly creeping hand
Of time and its command
Soon enough it comes
And settles in its place
It's shadow in my face
Undignified and lame
This life, well, it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control, well, it's slipping right through my hands
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Soon enough it comes (Ooh, ooh)
Soon enough it comes to tie us down (Ooh, ooh)

Ooh
It's coming 'round again
Slow
Slowly creeping hand

This life, well, it's slipping right through my hand
These days turned out nothing like I had planned
Control, well, it's slipping right through my hand
These days turned out nothing like I had planned

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oohEmbed
