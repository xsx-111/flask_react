Like A Dog Lyrics
In all that it takes
In all that it shows
The higher the stakes
The lower the blows
And all the mistakes
That he's never known
Whatever it takes
He'll be stealing the show

Now he nervously shakes when we rattle his stage
But he's happy to be stuck back in his halcyon days
Now we're trying hard to reconcile a history of shame
But he reinforced the barriers that keep it the same

If you treat me like a dog
And keep me locked in a cage
I'm not relaxed or comfortable
I'm aggravation and shame
If you treat me like a dog
Yeah, you treat me like a dog
But it's a fine, fine time for the people in the lucky land

In all that it takes
In all that it shows
The higher the stakes
The lower the blows
Now he nervously shakes when we rattle his stage
But he's happy to be stuck back in his halcyon days
Now we're trying hard to reconcile a history of shame
But he reinforced the barriers that keep it the same

If you treat me like a dog
And keep me locked in a cage
I'm not relaxed or comfortable
I'm aggravation and shame
If you treat me like a dog
And keep me locked in a cage
I'm not relaxed or comfortable
I'm aggravation and rage

If you treat me like a dog
And keep me locked in a cage
I'm not relaxed or comfortable
I'm aggravation and rageEmbed
