Whatever Makes You Happy LyricsIf we never make it back to how far we've come along this way
We search around for solid ground that will help to carry us away
If the memories I left throw the light that helps to guide you through
We trickle down to our goodbyes but a part of me will stay with you
What we've spoken over time, never broken or compromised
Dream on together, leaning against each other
However it happens I hope it's whatever makes you happy
Whatever makes you happy
Dream on together, leaning against each other
However it happens I hope it's whatever makes you happy
Whatever makes you happy then1Embed
