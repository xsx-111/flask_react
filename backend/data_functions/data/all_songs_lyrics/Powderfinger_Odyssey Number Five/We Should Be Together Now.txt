We Should Be Together Now LyricsWhat are you looking for this time around
Might need something to bring you to ground
Everything turning me inside and out
What are you looking for this time around
It's coming in and over
It's waiting at your shoulder
It's coming in and over
It's waiting at your shoulder
It's coming in and over
You can see we should be together now
Wait for me I'm pulling it together now
What are you looking for this time around
Just keep telling what you have found
All of this turning me upside and down
What are you looking for this time around
It's coming in and over
It's waiting at your shoulder
It's coming in and over
It's waiting at your shoulder
It's coming in and over
You can see we should be together now
Wait for me I'm pulling it together now
We should be together now
You can see we should be together now
Wait for me I'm pulling it together now
We should be together now
We should be together nowEmbed
