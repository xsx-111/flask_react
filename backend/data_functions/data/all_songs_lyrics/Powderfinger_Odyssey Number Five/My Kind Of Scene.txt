My Kind Of Scene Lyrics
Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
An unhappy life workin'
Some kind of dead-end job
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad

So lean to the side
Whisper it quiet
The end is in sight to working
All night around the clock
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad

But it's not my kind of scene, oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been, oh yeah
I'll watch from the other side

Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
Move out of sight and onto
Some life I'm dreamin' of
For everything you thought you had
Has gone from worse to bad
So I'll just wait and watch the wheels
While you're turning back
But it's not my kind of scene, oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been, oh yeah
I'll watch from the other side

It pulls me over and it drags me under
It pulls me over and it drags me under

Tell me where I'm
Supposed to begin
An unhappy life workin'

Alright now, alright now
Alright now, alright now

But it's not my kind of scene, oh yeah
Footprints on the other side
Remind me where I've been, oh yeah
I'll watch from the other side

Alright now, alright now
I'll watch from the other side
Alright now, alright now
I'll watch from the other sideEmbed
