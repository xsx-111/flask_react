Up & Down & Back Again LyricsCome and rescue me
In the water deep
Careful now don't lose your aim
The road ahead is clear again
I haven't found it yet
You drift away so slow
In the ebb and flow
So I landed on my feet
The steadiness is bittersweet
It feels the same when you're pushed
Out and away and into the crush
Of all the hidden pleasures you find
What you're looking for
I hope that you remember that pride
Comes before a fall
I can barely see up and down and back again
Despite what you believe
I keep away from trouble
If who I am today's a sign of where I'm going
I'm ready to embrace
You recreate the scene
Of everywhere you've been
You dvercome the dreaded curse
A symptom of the universe
It feels the same when you're pushed
Out and away and into the crush
Of all the hidden pleasures you find
What you're looking for
I hope that you remember that pride
Comes before a fall
I can barely see up and down and back again
Despite what you believe
I keep away from trouble
If who I am today's
A sign of where I'm going
I'm ready to embrace
If everybody knows just who you are
When your walk on role becomes a major part
Have you ever attempted to be yourself
When everybody wants you to be someone else
You wanna see the things you try to set free
Better let go of what lets them be
Have you ever attempted to be yourself
When everybody wants you to be someone else
Up and down and back again
Going up and down and back againEmbed
