Mood Indigo Lyrics

You ain't never been blue, no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
'Til you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh
Go along blues

I always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
And in the evening when lights are low
I'm so lonely I could cry
For there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die


You ain't never been blue, no, no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
'Til you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh
Go along blues1Embed
