He Needs Me LyricsHe needs me
He doesn't know it
But he needs me
And so no matter where he goes
Though he doesn't care
He knows that I'm there
He needs me
I oughta leave him
But he needs me
I know that I ain't very bright
Just to tag along
Oh, but right or wrong
I'm his... And I'm here
And I'm gonna be his friend
Or his lover
Cause my one ambition is
To wake him and make him discover that
He needs me
I've got to follow where he leads me
Or else he'll never know
That I need him
Just as he needs meEmbed
