Escape LyricsI'm gettin' outta this can
Who's gonna push you over da wall? Da warden?
I ain't goin over the wall
Oh, no?
No, under it
Wha, huh?
Yeah, a tunnel
Eh, your nuts
Da guards would spot
A tunnel in no time
Ya gotta have camouflage
I got it all worked out
I ain't goin' over the wall
The dirt, what do you, we do
With the dirt from the tunnel?Embed
