(Nothing But) Blood LyricsShould have been enough to change your mind
Could have been enough to take my breath away
Should have been enough to change your mind
Could have been enough to take my breath away
Should have been enough to change your mind
Could have been enough to take my breath away
Should have been enough to change your mind
Could have been enough to take my breath away
Should have been enough to change your mind
Could have been enough to take my breath away
Should have been enough to change your mind
Could have been enough to take my breath away
No matter how hard you try
No matter how many times it took
No matter how hard you try
No matter how many times it took
Now's the time to draw the line
It's time to say goodbye
(The air was blue)
It's now or never
(You could hold it in your hand blue)
You sigh
The time to draw the line
(The half-moon is aching)
(The air was blue)
It's time to say goodbye
It's now or never
Don't cry
(The air was blue)
The time to draw the line
(You could hold it in your hand blue)
It's time to say goodbye
(The half-moon is aching)
(The air was blue)
It's now or never
(You could hold it in your hand blue)
You sigh
The time to draw the line
(The air was blue)
It's time to say goodbye
(You could hold it in your hand blue)
It's now or never
(The half-moon is aching)
Don't cry
(The air was blue)
The time to draw the lineEmbed
