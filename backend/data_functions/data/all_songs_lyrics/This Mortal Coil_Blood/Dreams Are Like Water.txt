Dreams Are Like Water Lyrics(Dreams are like water)
The air was blue, you could hold it in your hand, blue
Remember me, I once told you and I tried to
Sad to realise that nothing lasts forever
Golden heart, you'll always be a child
We cried as we kissed - it was too new
We died and we lived - it was too new
Too strong still too much
When you were a child unhappiness took the place of dreams
Dreams are like water, colourless and dangerous
Without the strength to love, way beyond fear
You could care less if you could care at all
We cried as we kissed - it was too new
We died and we lived - it was too new
Too strong still too much1Embed
