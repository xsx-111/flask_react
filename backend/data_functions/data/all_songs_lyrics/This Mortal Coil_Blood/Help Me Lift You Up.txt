Help Me Lift You Up LyricsI don't have to tell you that you're all alone
Do what you will do not go home
You'll have to be with your own kind
I'll have to stay with my own kind
Help me lift you up
Help me lift you up
Sorry if I can't stop pretending
So sorry if I don't let you go
Like this, but not like this is ending
I think you know, I think you know
Help me lift you up
Help me lift you up
I have a dream - it's very clear
You're all around, but never near
Help me lift you up
Help me lift you up
(Dreams are like water, colourless and dangerous)Embed
