With Tomorrow LyricsIt was more like a dream than reality
I must have thought it was a dream while you were here with me
When you were near I didn't think you would leave
When you were gone it was too much to believe
So with tomorrow, I will borrow
Another moment of joy and sorrow
In another dream, and another
With tomorrow
So with the sun there won't be time just to look behind
There won't be reasons, no descriptions for my place in mind
There was so much I was told, it was not real
So many things that I could not taste
But I could feel
So with tomorrow, I will borrow
Another moment of joy and sorrow
In another dream, and another
With tomorrowEmbed
