Belly of the Beat Lyrics
Eh, eh eh
Ooh, ooh
Eh, eh eh
Ooh, ooh

I, I've been thinking, I've been thinking
I, I could leave the world today
Everybody dies, we anoint their eyes and we dance like angels do
Writing out your name, little shapes that feign some knowledge of you
And you'll never get sad and you'll never get sick
And you'll never get weak
We're deep
In the belly of the beat, yeah!

I, I've been thinking, I've been thinking
I, I could leave the world today
Everybody dies, we cut out their eyes and we dance like angels do
Making our name in a world that feigns some knowledge of you
And you'll never get sad and you'll never get sick
And you'll never get weak
We're deep
In the belly of the beat, yeah!5Embed
