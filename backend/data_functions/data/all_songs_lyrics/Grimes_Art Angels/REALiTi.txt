REALiTi Lyrics
Get up, this is what I see

When we were young, we used to get so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death
If we are always the same

Oh, I fear that no life will ever be like this again
'Cause your love kept me alive and it made me insane, oh, yeah

There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)
Whether you go or whether you stay
(I go back alone)
There was a time when the music would play
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
When we were young, we used to get so close to it
And you were scared and you were beautiful
I wanna peer over the edge and see in death
If we are always the same, oh, yeah

There were moments when it seemed okay
(But I go back alone)
Whether you go or whether you stay
(I go back alone)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
Oh, baby, every morning there are mountains to climb
Taking all my time
Oh, when I get up, this is what I see
Welcome to reality
To reality

Oh, baby, every (Give me a sign)
To reality
Oh, baby, every (Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every (Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every (Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every (Give me a sign)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, baby, every (Give me a sign)
Oh, baby, every
Oh, baby, every
Oh, baby, every
It sounds like corporate art
Break bread with an infidel
And plunge into the dark73Embed
