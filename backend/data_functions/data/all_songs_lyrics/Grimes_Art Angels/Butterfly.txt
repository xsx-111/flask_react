Butterfly Lyrics
Big beats, black cloud
Get it wrong, get loud
Write a song, get down
And everyone will know
And everyone will know
And everyone can go

Oh, then, get lost
Take his shit, maybe not
Listen good, he's gone
Everything you know
And everyone should go
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I don't need to know
So, do you want to?
Am I just right? (Is it just right?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me tonight?
Oh, it is perfect
You could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air

Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
Run away, get caught
Put in cell, livestock
Calculate, old body
Got you moving slow
And everyone will know
And everyone can go

Big bird, dead man
Wish I could save them
Don't know, no plan
Everyone can go
And nobody can know
And nobody can know

I don't need to know
So, do you want to?
Am I just (am I just?)
Can you see the enemy just isn't me?
Oh, baby, it is perfect
You could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air

Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
So fly away
If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl
Living in the real world
Looking for a dream girl

Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
Why you looking for a harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It’s a butterfly whose wings span the world
So fly away

If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl16Embed
