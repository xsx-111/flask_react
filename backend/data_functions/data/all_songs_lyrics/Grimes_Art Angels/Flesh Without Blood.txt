Flesh Without Blood Lyrics
Oh, ah-ah
Oh, ah-ah

You claw, you fight, you lose
Got a doll that looks just like you
Remember when we used to say
"I love you" almost every day
I saw the light in you, you know
Going out as I close our window
You never liked me anyway

Aye yeah, aye yeah
Aye, I don't see the light I saw in you before
And no, I don't
And no, I don't
And no, I don't care anymore

(Now you’ll never know)
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance
You destroy everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
You hate, you bite, you lose
After all, I just don't like you
It's nice that you say you like me
But only conditionally
Your voice, it had the perfect glow
It got lost when you gave it up though
Cause you want money, you want fame

Aye yeah, aye yeah
Aye, I don't see the light I saw in you before
And no, I don't
And no, I don't
And no, I don't care anymore

(Now you’ll never know)
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance
You destroy everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go

Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, sing along, baby
Then your heart beats on this sad song
Underground, underneath me
And the big things we could’ve had
Hey, hey, oh no
(Then your heart beats underground now)
(Now you’ll never know)
Baby, believe me
(Then your heart beats underground now)
And you had every chance
You destroy everything that you know
(Then your heart beats underground now)
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
(Then your heart beats underground now)
Just let me go
(Then your heart beats underground now)
Baby, believe me
And you had every chance
You destroy everything that you know
(Uncontrollable)
If you don't need me
Just let me go
(Then your heart beats underground now)

(Now you’ll never know)
Ah
(Then your heart beats underground now)
Ah
(Uncontrollable)
Ah
