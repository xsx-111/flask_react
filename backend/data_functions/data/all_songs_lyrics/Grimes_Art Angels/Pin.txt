Pin Lyrics
Dirt in your fingernails
Blood on your knees
But did that ever make you happy?
I think you were my best friend
Gentle do not reprehend
I know it hasn't been a dream
But if you pardon, I will mend
Drunk in a parking lot
Just after three
Tearin' out your hair like a banshee
Lighter and a safety pin
Light the end, burn the skin
I'll stick to you forever
Cause this scar I think is permanent

Oh
Falling off the edge with you
Oh
It was too good to be true
Too good to be true

Bite off your fingernails
Cut up your skin
Tell me that it didn't happen
Running  through the dark woods
Fallen couldn't see straight
I was only looking for a human to reciprocate
Baby it's a black hole
I need it to breathe
But does it really make you happy?
Kiss me with a big knife
Bloody heart of paradise
Living like a soldier
Peace of mind must be nice

Oh falling off the edge with you
Oh it was too good to be true
Too good to be true

Thought I had won
I thought I won til I lost
And I, fixing my fall
But for what cost?
And I see your reflection when I look at mine
And I say (I say, I say)
Baby, don't go away
Falling off the edge with you
It was too good to be true
Falling off the edge with you
It was too good to be true
Too good to be true19Embed
