World Princess, Pt. II Lyrics
I got a big dream, small world in between
Me and everything I can't do
Not really that great, just okay and kinda fake
You sucked the life right out of the room

I know most likely
How I used to be a frail and silly thought in your mind
Don't be unkind
You're so far behind me

But I can't see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, who made a mistake?
Don't you cry

It's mine
It's mine

I saw the parade, big band, masquerade
So what brings you now to my feet?
Back at the first page, nothing gained for you but age
Oh, nothing else could be more complete
I know most likely
How I used to be a frail and silly thought in your mind
Call me unkind
You're so far behind me

But I can't see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, who made a mistake?
Don't you cry

It's mine
It's mine
Dim the light
In your head, in your heart, in your hiding emotion
Where the waters meet?
Dim the light
In the head, in the heart, in your hiding emotion
Where the waters meet?

But I can't see something more
Than the things you try to take
Now, who made a mistake?
Don't you cry
It's mine
It's mine
It's mine
It's mine
It's mine

If I stare into the darkness, I won’t know where I am
I haven’t seen the daylight since I started giving in
My eyes are falling heavy, my feet are moving slow
Am I main fature not in the stone25Embed
