Kill V. Maim Lyrics
I got in a fight, I was indisposed
I was in, despite all the wicked prose
But I'm only a man, and I do what I can
I got friends in high places
I get out for free
I got in a fight but they don't know me
'Cause I'm only a man
And I do what I can

B-E-H-A-V-E
Arrest us
Italiana mobster
Looking so precious
B-E-H-A-V-E
Never more
You gave up being good when you declared a state of war

Eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh
Are you going to the party?
Are you going to the show?
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can, oh
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?

I did something bad, maybe I was wrong
Sometimes people say that I'm a big time bomb
But I'm only a man
And I do what I can

B-E-H-A-V-E
Arrest us
Italiana mobster
Looking so precious
B-E-H-A-V-E
Never more
You gave up being good when you declared a state of war

Eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can, oh
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can
Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?

Oh, the fire it's all right
'Cause we can make 'em all go crazy
We can make 'em wanna die
Oh, the fire it's all right
The people touch it
I can't touch it
Even though it's mine

Eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh eh
I don't behave, I don't behave, oh
(Are you going to the party? Are you going to the show?)
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can, oh
'Cause I'm only a man, do what I can
