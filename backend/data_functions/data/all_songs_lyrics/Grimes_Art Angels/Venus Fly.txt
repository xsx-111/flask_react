Venus Fly Lyrics
Hey, oh why you looking at me? (Against the music)
Hey, oh why you looking at me? (Baby I can use it)
(Pitty pat, doing that, talking smack, got my back
Pitty pat, call it black, talking smack)

Why you looking at me now?
Why you looking at me again?
What if I pulled my teeth?
Cut my hair underneath my chin
Wrap my curls all around the world
Throw my pearls all across the floor
Feeling my beat like a sniper girl
('Cause I want it more)

Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
(Against the music)
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me? (Baby I can use it)

Pitty, pitty, pitty pat
Why you always doing that?
Why you always talking smack?
Yeah, Grimes got my back
Pitty, pitty, pitty pat
Why you always call it black?
Why you always talking smack?
Yeah, Grimes-
Why you looking at me now?
Why you looking at me again?
What if I pulled my teeth?
Cut my hair underneath my chin
Wrap my curls all around the world
Throw my pearls all across the floor
Feeling my beat like a sniper girl
('Cause I want it more)

Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
(Against the music)
Hey, what about me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me? (Baby I can use it)
(Venus fly!)
Hey! What about...
Again...
Hey! What about...
Oh, why you looking at me?
Again..
Again..
(Why you always talking smack...)
Hey!
Oh, why you looking at me?
Oh, why you looking at me?
Baby, I can use it
(All gotta freak, yeah, you a freak!
I said we all gotta freak, yeah, you a freak!
Freak, freak)31Embed
