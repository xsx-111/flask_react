Life in the Vivid Dream Lyrics
I could live in the world just like a stranger
I could tell you the truth or a lie
I could tell you that people are good in the end
But why, why would I?
Angels will cry when it's raining
Tears that are no longer clean
What do you mean?
What do you mean, it's all gone?
I've waited here so long

The minds of the people
Have withered to nothing
Know that youâ€™re missing something
You wanna leave the world with me
You wanna leave22Embed
