Mask Lyrics
Black pyramid burn a hole in the sky
Black pyramid take my baby away
From the edge of the desert
To the bottom of the sea
Black pyramid cast your shadow on me

I feel like life has no beginning
I feel like life it has no end
I feel like life has no beginning
I feel like life it has no end

Black pyramid flash of light in the sky
Black pyramid took my baby away
He woke up in a field and forgot his name
Black pyramid cast your shadow on the flame

I feel like life has no beginning
I feel like life it has no end
I feel like life has no beginning
I feel like life it has no end

I feel like life has no beginning
I feel like life it has no end
I feel like life has no beginning
I feel like life it has no endEmbed
