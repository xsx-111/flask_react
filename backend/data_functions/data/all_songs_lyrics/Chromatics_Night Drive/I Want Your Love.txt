I Want Your Love Lyrics
When I came to this world
I arrived in a car
I was a boy
I was a girl
Pyramid glass
Scraping the sky
See our reflection
Cast no reflection

I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love

When I came to this world
I arrived in a storm
Alone in the rain
Falling out from the clouds
Voice on the radio
Crying 96 tears
See our reflection
Cast no reflection
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love

When I came to this world
From the inside
Feeling the space
Between death and life
Between blocks of dreams
Between walls of sleep
See our reflection
Cast no reflection

I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love

When I leave from this world
I will leave in a storm
I'll be a boy
And I'll be a girl
I'll see through glass
I'll scrape the sky
See my reflection
It's just a reflection
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love

I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your loveEmbed
