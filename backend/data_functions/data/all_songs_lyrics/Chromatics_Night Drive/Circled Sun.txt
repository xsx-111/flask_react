Circled Sun LyricsCircled Sun
Your Are Not The Only One
To Have Fallen From The Sky
Circled Sun
I Have Fallen From The Sky
After All We Say Is Done
Can Our Hearts Still Beat As One?
Will Our Love Begin To Fade?
What Is Left Of What We Made?
Will Our Grip Turn Into Gold?
& Our Hearts Return To Stone?
After All We've Seen & Done
After All We've Seen & Done
In A Haze Of Right & Wrong
I Awake Without A Song
After All We've Seen Is Gone
After All We've Said Is Gone
Circled Sun
Your Are Not The Only One
To Have Fallen From The SkyEmbed
