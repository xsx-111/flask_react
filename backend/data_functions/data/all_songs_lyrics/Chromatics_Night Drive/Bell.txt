Bell LyricsWe wonder who it's ringing for
You know it's right outside your door
It washes all the pain away
As all the colors start to fade
Now we know it's plain to see
The bell is ringing for you and me
We wonder who it's ringing for
You know it's right outside your door
It washes all the pain away
As all the colors start to fade
Now we know it's plain to see
The bell is ringing for you and meEmbed
