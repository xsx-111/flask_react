Accelerator LyricsWhat's this useful optimism
Empty headed kids are bad
God I'm feeling I got a hunger
I love my soul I'm satisfiedCome on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the acceleratorLiving on to be a sinner
Lord it's hard to be a saint
Had a sister, had a grandma
It's bad to show I can't let you inCome on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come onHere we come, we're coming fast
Out the upside into the past
Forced to screaming in my head
Into the future, into the futureCome on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the acceleratorCome on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the acceleratorCome onEmbed
