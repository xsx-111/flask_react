The Gemini LyricsReflecting in the water
A puzzle becomes clear
Two pairs of eyes
Watching me, watching you fade away
Watching me, watching you fade away
You try to see behind a mirror
Through a crystal curtain
Beyond our shattered dreams
Reflecting in the water
A puzzle becomes clear
Are we still married?
Chasing me, chasing you
Who are you?
A pair of eyes?
Or are you Gemini?Embed
