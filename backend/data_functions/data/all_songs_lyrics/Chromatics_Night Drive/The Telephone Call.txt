The Telephone Call Lyrics
Hello?
Hey, it's me
Hey babe, what's going on
I'm just leaving the club right now
Oh, how was it tonight?
Good, the DJs were alright
Oh, good. Do you want to come over?
Yeah, I'll be there in about an hour - I'm going to go for a drive
Hey, can you cop a bottle of wine on your way
Sure
Ok, I'll see you soon
Ok, I love you
I love you tooEmbed
