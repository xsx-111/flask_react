Night Drive Lyrics
I take a drive in my car
I take a drive in my car
I see the sun disappear
I see the sun disappear

Oh, little stranger
Bring my baby back to me
Oh, little stranger
Bring my baby back home

My leather glove grips the wheel
My leather glove grips the wheel
I see the sun disappear
I see the sun disappear

Oh, little stranger
Bring my baby back to me
Oh, little stranger
Bring my baby back home

Windows down, our hair in the breeze
Windows down, our hair in the breeze
We see the sun reappear
We see the sun reappear
Oh, little stranger
Bring my baby back to me
Oh, little stranger
Bring my baby back home
Bring my baby back homeEmbed
