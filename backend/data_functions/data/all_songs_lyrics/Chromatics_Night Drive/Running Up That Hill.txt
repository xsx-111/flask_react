Running Up That Hill Lyrics
It didn't hurt me
But you wanna feel how it feels
But you wanna know that it didn't hurt me
But you wanna hear about the deal they're making, oh

You
It's you and me
It's you and me who won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building

Do you wanna hurt me?
Let's see how deep the bullet lies
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder
There is thunder in our hearts
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?
Tell me we both matter, don't we?
You
It's you and me
It's you and me who won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
No problem

You
It's you and me
It's you and me who won't be unhappy
C'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
And if I only could...


C'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience

C'mon baby, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
C'mon angel, c'mon, c'mon, darling
Let's exchange the experience
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
No problem1Embed
