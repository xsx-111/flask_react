Kute LyricsI think you're kute
I'll keep you in the cellar
Show you to the children
Kill me after dinner
You're alright
You look like someone I could bury
In the garden
Cover you in diamonds
When I die
And when I die
I'll dig you up
I'll tear out all your feathers
Cook you in the oven
Burn myself
What is mommy cookin'?
She looks like a baby
You love me
Do you love me?
You wanna die
You really wanna see us laughin'
At your body
Floating down the river
Baby, you're pathetic
You are god
You are godEmbed
