Adam (Bonus Track) LyricsI'll make
A twenty dollar bet
Adam won't get
His lunchbox back
I took it
An hour ago
He's cryin' in the snow
I'll never let it go
I hope
When Adam goes home
He hides it from his mom
He thinks of me alone
And when
We're swimmin' at the Y
I'll splash him in the eye
I'll dunk him till he cries
I'll make
A twenty dollar bet
Adam won't get
His lunchbox back
I took it
An hour ago
He's cryin' in the snow
I want him so2Embed
