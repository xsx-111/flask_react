Whale LyricsMy favorite animal is the whale
I like his big fat tail
I like his big fat tail
I wanna cut off a piece of him, and I'll share
You get a piece of the whale
You get a piece of the whale
I'm gonna fry mine with cinnamon and a pear
It's a three-course meal
It's a three-course meal
My favorite animal is the whale
I like his big fat tail
I like his big fat tailEmbed
