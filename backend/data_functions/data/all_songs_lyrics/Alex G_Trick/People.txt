People LyricsI don't love anyone but myself and Marty
'Cause he holds my money
I wanna be anything on TV, I wanna be famous
Do you think they want me?
I'll clean up while you're at work
Matching socks and ironed shirts
Sarah shows me how you want it
I took my favorite pill on Monday, it made me go backwards
Do you wanna feel good?
I made a special drink for myself and I'm gonna drink it
All by myselfEmbed
