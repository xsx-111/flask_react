Memory LyricsI was waiting for a baggie
A powder bunny
I have a buddy I grew up with
He hooked it up for me
I'm helpin' it my own way
When I'm stuck in bed
A little more than a memory
Sticks in my head
I really like the game we played
You left the CD here
A lot of positive messages
And something left unclearEmbed
