16 Mirrors LyricsLet's get all the years where I was her friend
(Look at all the mirrors at the bottom of the well)
I thought I lost my heartbeat, I wanna tell you
(This is a piece of cake working with my hands)
This one is a page where I used too many colors
(Sixteen mirrors at the bottom of the well)
Roll it in a mirror, all my work will be discovered
(This is a piece of cake working with my hands)
Let's get all the years where I was her friend
(Look at all the mirrors at the bottom of the well)
I thought I lost my heartbeat, I wanna tell you
(This is a piece of cake working with my hands)
This one is a page where I
(Sixteen mirrors)
This one is a page where I
(Sixteen mirrors)
This one is a page where I
(Sixteen mirrors)
This one is a page where I
(Sixteen mirrors
Sixteen mirrors
Sixteen mirrors
Sixteen mirrors
Sixteen mirrors)Embed
