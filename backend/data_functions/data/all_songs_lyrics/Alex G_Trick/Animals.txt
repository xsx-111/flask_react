Animals LyricsI get sick when I get stoned
Everything we do, we do it alone
I get sick when I get stoned
Everything we do, we do it alone
Rosie is my favorite dog
Takes her piss on the neighbor's lawn
Rosie is my favorite dog
Bites my hand when I go wrong
I do
Animals, not people
I do animals
Not people
I do
Who's that walking down your stairs?
Double check, there's something there
Who's that walking down your stairs?
Double check, there's something there
Rosie told me not to cry
Look her in her big brown eyes
Hold her tight and feel no pain
Her dog breath drives me insane
I do
Animals, not people
I do animals
Not people
I do2Embed
