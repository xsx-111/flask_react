String LyricsI do believe you're moving at a pace
A little bit too slow for my taste
It's such a funny movie, why not go?
Yeah, don't you think you oughta know?
Are you a girl on a string?
Are you a girl on a string?
Are you a girl on a string?
Are you a girl on a string?
Would you mind if I came back to you?
We could listen to the music you're into
It's such a crazy party, why not go?
Yeah, don't you think you oughta know?
Are you a girl on a string?
Are you a girl on a string?
Are you a girl on a string?
Are you a girl on a string?Embed
