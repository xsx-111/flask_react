Forever LyricsBurns in the sun
Lives for no one
Salt on your tongue
Lights out, no fun
Drink to forget
Don't get upset
Open your mouth
You look so
Out of it
Pull it together
We could love you
Forever and ever
Pull it together
We could love you
Forever and ever
Made up a game
No pain, no gain
Until you break
Make no mistake
I will pull it together
You can love me
Forever and ever
I will pull it together
You can love me
Forever and ever1Embed
