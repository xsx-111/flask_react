Change LyricsHow are you today?
I saw your friend's band play
A little show last night
It's not my thing, they were alright
You're in my dream last week
I'd like to hear what you think
We passed a house, driving fast
The sun was shining on the grass
You made me stop and leave the car
You pulled my sleeve but not too hard
Remember when you took too much?
I didn't mind being your crutch
We loved you then
It's not the same
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things change
I don't like how things change1Embed
