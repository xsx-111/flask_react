Mary LyricsMary is the girl that I wanna kiss
Shes got big red eyes and big red lips
Shes got big sharp teeth and big fat hips
Mary is the girl that I wanna fuck
She's got leather heart and leather gloves
She's the only girl that I wanna love
"Listen to me, baby, I don't mind
I wanna be with you and waste my time"
"Give it to me, baby, I feel good I wanna
Feel whatever you think I should"
"Sing it for me, baby, play my song
I wanna hear your daddy sing along"
Mary is the girl that leaves you to rot, she says
"I am real and you are not"3Embed
