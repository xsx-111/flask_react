The End Lyrics
Your hair reminds me
Of a time when we once were
Your fingernails that marked my back
Now rot in earth
The sheets we slept in, blew away
And now the storm is over
The taste of you inside my mouth remains
But still I'm hearing

There's no love
Everybody's crying
There's no truth
Everyone's misguided

And now the end is here!
There's no more pills to swallow!
The bitter taste I feel
Will lead me to tomorrow!

Your scent reminds me
Of a place we used to go
The kisses placed upon my neck
Show signs of
No return!
The bed we fucked in
Smells the same
And now the stench is fading
The taste of you inside my mouth remains
But still I'm hearing
There's no love
Everybody's crying
There's no truth
Everyone's misguided

And now the end is here!
There's no more pills to swallow!
The bitter taste I feel
Will lead me to tomorrow!

Cries for anger, lies for power
Fighting for nothing, is what you were born for
Cries for anger, lies for power
Fighting for nothing, is what you were born for
Yeah!


Cries for anger, lies for power
Fighting for nothing, is what you were born for
Cries for anger, lies for power
Fighting for nothing, is what you were born for!3Embed
