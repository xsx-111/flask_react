4 Words (To Choke Upon) Lyrics
Betrayed one more time
But somewhere down that line
You're gonna get what's coming to you!
Look at me now!
Look at me now!
Look at me now!

Pull it out from my back
Soon I'm the one that's on attack
I can't wait to return the favour
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now!

Too many times I've seen it
Rip a hole into our friendship
This is how it's been
How it always will be
You think you're above me? (You think you're above me!)
But now I'm here to envy
Four words to choke upon!
Look! (Look!)
At me, now!
Betrayed one more time
But somewhere down that line
You're gonna get what's coming to you
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now!

Pull it out from my back
Soon I'm the one that's on attack
Can't wait to return the favour
Look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now!

Too many times I've seen it
Rip a hole into our friendship
This is how it's been
How it always will be
You think you're above me? (You think you're above me!)
But now I'm here to envy
Four words to choke upon!
Look! (Look!)
At, me... now!
Oh!


Too many times I've seen it
Rip a hole into our friendship
Four words to choke upon!

Too many times I've seen it
Rip a hole into our friendship
This is how it's been
How it always will be
You think you're above me? (You think you're above me!)
But now I'm here to end this
Four words to choke upon!
Look! (Look!)
At, me... now!4Embed
