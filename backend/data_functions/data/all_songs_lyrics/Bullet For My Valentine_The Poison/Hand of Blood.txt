Hand of Blood Lyrics
Oh!

There goes my valentine again
Soaked in red for what she said
And now she's gone!
Oh my god have I done it again?!
There's a pulse and it's deafening!
I can't help what I hear in my head!
It's the switch that I flick (When it says)

Hand of blood!
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood!
I don't want to see, my life is burning!

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run!) I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?
There's a stain on my hand and it's red!
Oh my god, am I losing it?
I can't help what I've done or I've said
It's the button I push (When it says)

Hand of blood!
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood!
I don't want to see, my life is burning!

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run!) I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?

No!

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing?
(I saw you run!) I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?7Embed
