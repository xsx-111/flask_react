My Fist, Your Mouth, Her Scars Lyrics
Bleed, when you thought you knew
Do you hear me shout?
Bleeding through my head, my heart, my eyes!
(To come home!)
What I'm thinking now
When I take you out
We can hold these thoughts I have of you until it comes!

There's no more ways to tell you
I want to fuck you now
With every ounce of anger
In turn we know you're going down

Now, it's over, I'm calmer
Her crimson flowing down
Like water
I saw her as she hit the ground!
Now, it's over, I'm calmer
Her crimson flowing down
Like water
I saw her as she hit the ground!

Bruise, when I tear you up
Have I gone too far?
What about my fist, your mouth, her scars!
(To come home!)
What I'm thinking now
When I stumble down
We can never say that you are gone until it comes!
There's no more ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick, you're going down!

Now, it's over, I'm calmer
Her crimson flowing down
Like water
I saw her as she hit the ground!
Now, it's over, I'm calmer
Her crimson flowing down
Like water
I saw her as she hit the ground!


Hey, when you thought you knew
Do you hear me shout?
Bleeding through my head, my heart, my eyes!
(To come home!)
What I'm thinking now
When I take you out
We can hold these thoughts I have of you until it comes!
There's no more ways to show you
I just can't take no more
The thought of me inside you
Just makes me sick, you're going down!

There's no more ways to tell you
I want to fuck you now
With every ounce of anger
In turn we know you're going down!1Embed
