Seven Days Lyrics
Here it comes again!
Yeah!

Want it!
You don't want it so why don't you crave it?
Seven days till it comes to torture you
Nothing better
You can't say no to this one thing!
You've had it all given to you!
Fuck it!
If you want it, why don't you get it?
Better days that hold you from nothing
Why is it you can't say no to this one thing?

You've had it all given to you
You never had to work at all before

I never meant it
I never felt it
I'm never taking back a single word I've said
I'm never taking back now!
I never meant it
I never felt it
I'm never taking back a single word I've said
Want it!
You don't want it so why don't you crave it?
Seven days till it comes to torture you
Nothing better
You can't say no to this one thing!
You've had it all given to you!
Fuck it!
If you want it, why don't you get it?
Better days that hold you from nothing
Why is it you just can't say no?!

You've had it all given to you
You never had to work at all before

I never meant it
I never felt it
I'm never taking back a single word I've said
(I'm never taking back now!)
I never meant it
I'm never taking back a single word I've said

I never meant it
I never felt it
I'm never taking back a single word I've said
(I'm never taking back now!)
I never meant it
I'm never taking back a single word I've saidEmbed
