Spit You Out Lyrics
I am what I am, so I
Spit you out!
Do I, cut the ties?
Or do I, hold on tight?!
Time has come for me to realize
All those things I loved I now despise

But it's my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's our time!
(To rise above!)
It's my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's our time!

Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over

I am what I am, so I
Spit you out!
Can you justify how I
Time has come for me to realize
All those things I loved I now despise
But it's my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's our time!
(To rise above!)
It's my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's our time!

Your pictures on my wall
With this around me I don't feel it's over
I've never felt this way before
With you around me I don't feel it's over now!
Yeah!

I know you're faking!
You try to get me back!
I know you're faking it!
Yeah!
(Feel it's over)
(Feel it's over)
(Bullet For My Valentine!)
(How we doing everyone?!)
But it's my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's our time!
(To rise above!)
It's my life!
(I'm taking back what's mine!)
It's our time!
To rise above!1Embed
