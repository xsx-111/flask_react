The Poison Lyrics
Now, is your time to die!
We've gathered here to say goodbye
No more, you'll cry!
No reason left for you to fight
Feel, pain, no more!
Emotions never felt before
Where do we go! (We go?)
She'll never know!

Holding on to you, to keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending

Hard times, we always saw!
There's nothing left of you no more
Fear has no place, no place!
Cover her face!

Holding on to you, to keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending
This is our last goodbye (goodbye!)
This is our time tonight


Holding on to you!
Cover up her face!
Holding on to you, to keep from falling!

Holding on to you, to keep from falling
Your eyes are closing now
Another chapter's ending

This is our last goodbye (goodbye!)
This is our time tonight (goodbye!)
This is our last goodbye!Embed
