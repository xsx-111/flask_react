Hit the Floor Lyrics
I see you walking home alone, your face is alive and bright
But you can't see how weak you are 'cause I could end it tonight
It's the feeling you get when you think that someone behind is watching you
Well I can tell you now, that someone is me and I'm about to make it right

Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd
Hit the floor!

I creep up from behind, touch your neck, move down your spine
You take a look and breathe so sharp
Just a matter of time
Don't scream I ask of you, but then you let one out so now it's time to go
I come down on you like a ton of brick
All over so it's time to go

Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Hit the floor!
Whoa-oh-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-ah-oh-oh-oh

Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd hit the floor
Why do you take it all?
Why do I beg for more?
I never thought that this is how I'd
Hit the floor!

Take this for me, I don't want to hurt you
Take this for me, I don't want to hurt you!1Embed
