10 Years Today Lyrics
Ten years ago, I got a call that nearly killed me
Repeat yourself, my hands are shaking
When I was told, my friend was gone I felt so guilty
A thousand questions left unanswered

I'll bleed if you want me to!
I'll serenade before I do
I'll bleed if you want me to!

On and on although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go?
Ten years today!

Ten years ago, I stood beside the wood that held you
I must sit down, my legs are shaking
We let you go, with gifts of plectrums for your journey
And melodies to help you on your way

I'll bleed if you want me to!
I'll serenade before I do
I'll bleed if you want me to!
On and on although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go?
Ten years today!

Whoah-oh-ah
Whoah-oh-oh
Whoah-oh-ah

I'll bleed if you want me to
(I'll bleed if you want me to!)
I'll bleed if you want me to!

On and on although you're gone
Candles burn without a flame on
Our final call to you, I know you're listening!
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go?
Ten years today!
Where did you go? (ten years today!)
Where did you go?
How could you leave us that way?
Where did you go? (ten years today!)1Embed
