Her Voice Resides Lyrics
Our time is ending, I feel it's only just begun!
And I'm frustrated!
I can't believe you're not the one
My ears are bleeding!
Her voice resides inside my head
And now I'm choking!
Release this noose around my neck!

Will I just fall to pieces
Or am I all right?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me 'til they're gone!

These are my final words to you!
I know you're listening, can you hear me?
The time has come to say goodbye!
These are my final words, to you

The clock is ticking!
My heart is bursting through my chest!
And now I'm crying!
The tears are pouring off my face!
The chair is creaking!
Her voice resides inside my head!
And now it's over!
You put this noose around my neck!
Will I just fall to pieces?
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me 'til they're gone!

These are my final words to you!
I know you're listening, can you hear me?
The time has come to say goodbye!
These are my final words, to you

Heaven, where is my angel?
I need her now
Holding me!
Heaven, where is my angel?
I need her now, holding me
Tonight!
Now!


Will I just fall to pieces?
Or am I alright?
To iron out my creases
You must lacerate me 'til they're gone!
These are my final words to you
I know you're listening, can you hear me?
The time has come to say goodbye!
These are my final words, to you!1Embed
