Suffocating Under Words of Sorrow (What Can I Do) Lyrics
The night has started, here we go!
I've taken everything!
This is our time to lose control!
What do you want from me?
You line them up we'll put them down, this is so frustrating
To watch you sleazing all around, yet you keep on smiling

What can I do to make you see? (You're guilty!)
What can I do to make you feel, you're wanted?
What can I do to make you see? (You're guilty!)
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow

Her skin reflects behind the blur, I'm intoxicated
Where am I from? Why I am here? You're so predictable!
Her fingers running through my hair, but it's all just fiction
She steps out from her underwear, so beautiful!

What can I do to make you see? (You're guilty!)
What can I do to make you feel, you're wanted?
What can I do to make you see? (You're guilty!)
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow

Go!

There's bodies lying on the floor, but I keep on staring
My world is over, close the door!
Her skin reflects behind the blur, I'm intoxicated
Where am I from? Why I am here? You're so predictable
Her fingers running through my hair, I've a new addiction
She steps out from her underwear, so beautiful!

What can I do to make you see? (You're guilty!)
What can I do to make you feel, you're wanted?
What can I do to make you see? (You're guilty!)
I'm suffocating under words of sorrow (Words of sorrow!)3Embed
