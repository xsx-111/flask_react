New Terrain LyricsSoft sheets
What's this about?
Inside your mahogany Cyprus
As long as we're me and you
We should not lose terrain
Wild and young, we get seasick
On your seven
Get off cheap
That sits with her
And the warmth of it splatters
We all can wring her neck
First we gain new terrain
When we're young, we get seasick
On your seven
We're upset, real tush
Ooh why I sneeze like no one
Like most, you snip soft sheets
What's this about?
Inside your mahogany Cyprus
As long as we're me and you
We should not lose terrain
When we're young, we get seasick
On your seven soft sheetsEmbed
