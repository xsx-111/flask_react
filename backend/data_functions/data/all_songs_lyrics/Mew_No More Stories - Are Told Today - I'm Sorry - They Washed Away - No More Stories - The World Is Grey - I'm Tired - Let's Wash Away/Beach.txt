Beach LyricsI was on my way, I swear
But I took a wrong turn there
For I zigged when I should have zagged
It’s a sombre turn-out tonight in chemistry class
Tragedy in our park
Something happened in the dark
We brought raincoats and pretty charms
And I did remember this time to keep it inside
Then we kept the water still
On the broken window sill
For if not, we’d have to move
It is sweet outside
Where it seems magical
And if nothing works
We’ll do nothing
I hope we’re on time
And we shouldn’t look at the sky
The perilous light
We were not allowed outside
And no-one could tell us why
I got worried, with shaky hands
So we said the words that we kept for worrying times
I was on my way, I swear
But I lost my way somewhere
And the trees were listening
From the sill is trickling water when the rain returns
We have our suspicions, thinking what my heart confirms
It is sweet outside
Where it seems magical
And if nothing works
We’ll do nothing
Save yourself tonight
Asleep in the dark
I hope we’re on timeEmbed
