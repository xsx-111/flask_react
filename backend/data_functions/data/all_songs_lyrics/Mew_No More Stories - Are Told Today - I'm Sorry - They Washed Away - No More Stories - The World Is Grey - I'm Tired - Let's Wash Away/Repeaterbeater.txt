Repeaterbeater LyricsSometimes I've got nothing to say
Nothing to sing about
That makes you lie awake
Sometimes I've got nothing to do
Nothing to signal out
When I can't be with you
How should I hold this girlfriend
As tight as I ever could?
Now why should I?
No reason why
You wore me down
Worse did I show
Show me something good
Show me something
Sometimes I am nowhere to be found
If it is just a bed
Then why the ringing sound?
Sometimes we've got nowhere to be
Nothing to talk about
And nothing to agree on
How should I hold this girlfriend
As tight as I ever could?
Now why should I?
No reason why
You wore me down
Worse did I show
How should I hold this girlfriend
As tight as I ever could?
Now why should I?
No reason why
You wore me down
Worse did I showEmbed
