Introducing Palace Players Lyrics
Oh Anna and Sammy too
What is it that you do?
You gotta get back up yourself
We know so much
So much we do
(No answer)
In a word you were told
That it'd fix your shaky home
And what got made
Was broken too

Just a field with you
Switching seats with you
Tears us apart
(I don't want it to)
Some peculiar fix
The two of us
Counting us out
(I don't want it to)

(Overnight, turned all grey)
What is it that you do?
You gotta get back up yourself
We know so much
So much we do
(No answer)
In a word you were told
That it'd fix your shaky home
And what got made
Was broken too
Just a field with you
Switching seats with you
Tears us apart
(I don't want it to)
Some peculiar fix
The two of us
Counting us out
(I don't want it to)
Just a creed with you
Switching seats with you
Tears us apart
(I don't want it to)
What are we going to do?
I'd really like it if you
Turned out the lights as we planned
It's gonna hurt when we land
(I don't want it to)

Why did you go?
Lots of different reasons
So many, you can't even count
You think it's right
Jumping off the seesaw
Or do you just want it to be?Embed
