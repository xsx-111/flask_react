Hawaii LyricsYou know time goes by fast like rain
It swallows your every sound
From whisper to icy howl
You know time goes by fast like rain
It swallows your every sound
From whisper to icy howl
Good luck trying to be someone
If you make it then you’ve won
You’ll grow up to be someone
I can’t go without you
No, I need to have you
Have you met someone?
Have you touched the bottom?
The weather is like you
Third time’s the charm
Like a dog it’s breathing
They are just as lonely
And we all make mistakes once in a while
The weather is like you
Third time’s the charm
Like a dog it’s breathing
It was right beyond doubt
Things just didn’t pan out
It’s a movie set
It’s a world constructed
I can’t go without you
I’m a ghost to have you
Have you met someone?
Have you touched the bottom?
The weather is like you
Third time’s the charm
Like a dog it’s breathing
They are just as lonely
And we all make mistakes once in a while
The weather is like you
Here comes the charm
Like a dog it’s breathing
They are just as lonely
And we all make mistakes once in a while
The weather is like you
The weather is like youEmbed
