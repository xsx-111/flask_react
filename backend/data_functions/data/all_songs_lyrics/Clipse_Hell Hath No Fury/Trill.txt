Trill Lyrics
Uh, I got jewels (Uh), plus wheels (What?)
Pullin' up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels (Fuck out of here)
And she feelin' around for them pills
Bitch, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Bitch, I'm so trill (What?)
Nigga, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Nigga, I'm so trill (What? What?)
I got my steel, I'll peel
Pullin' up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels
And she feelin' around for them pills
Bitch, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Bitch, I'm so trill (What?)
Nigga, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Nigga, I'm so trill (What? What?)

G's up, rev them V's up
Federales trying to reach us to keep us
Flooded pieces, diamond size Reese's Pieces
You know who he is
Nigga talk show like Regis (What?)
King Push flow prestigious, hoes suck me like leeches
X and Os, tic-tac-toes
Fuck 'em, duck 'em, let them go, on to the next (Uh)
Got this in the decks of them Cali low-lows
Houston, candy paint, screwed up vocals
New York, Range Rov, sit on Mo-Mos
Pusha in that Bentley, G-T, oh no
Flow chameleon, worth 'bout a million
Sell Bolivian, Feds in oblivion
Bitch Brazilian, purse reptilian
Took her from far off island like Gilligan
Uh, I got jewels (Uh), plus wheels (What?)
Pullin' up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels (Fuck out of here)
And she feelin' around for them pills
Bitch, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Bitch, I'm so trill (What?)
Nigga, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Nigga, I'm so trill (What? What?)
I got my steel, I'll peel
Pullin' up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels
And she feelin' around for them pills
Bitch, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Bitch, I'm so trill (What?)
Nigga, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Nigga, I'm so trill (What? What?)

It's me ma, you ain't dreamin'
Starstruck bitch damn near stopped breathin'
So real that hon' ain't believin'
Out my bracelet, she can't make rhyme or reason
Soon as you get your heart involved
That's when I fall back, love, au revoir
So international, French Riviera
Love for foreign cars would explain my Carrera
Who cares when these fools talk?
Don't mean jack 'til that tool gotta talk
Icy wrists help me to cool off
And the second hand on this bitch, it moonwalk
Reminds me of how I applied myself
And why I now ride with Tiptronic help
Bankroll on overload
I eeny meeny miny moe them hoes, I'm so trill
Uh, I got jewels (Uh), plus wheels (What?)
Pullin' up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels (Fuck out of here)
And she feelin' around for them pills
Bitch, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Bitch, I'm so trill (What?)
Nigga, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Nigga, I'm so trill (What? What?)
I got my steel, I'll peel
Pullin' up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels
And she feelin' around for them pills
Bitch, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Bitch, I'm so trill (What?)
Nigga, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Nigga, I'm so trill (What? What?)

So many different things make me trill
Start with that 'B' with wings over the grill
Maybe how my way with words make me mils
Or maybe it's my way with birds, digital scales
Young, restless, talk so reckless
Two hundred thousand up in my necklace
Four of ya Hummers wrapped 'round my neck bitch
I ain't mention the Rollie redneck like Texas
To y'all ill-wishers who wanna take part
In me getting robbed, well follow ya heart
And I'll waste ya, hell, I raised ya
Even let 'em cheat from my paper
Why does wealth make them hate me
And make chicks' hearts so achy breaky?
Rarely do I toot my own horn
But y'all fellas got too far gone, now come back

Uh, I got jewels (Uh), plus wheels (What?)
Pullin' up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels (Fuck out of here)
And she feelin' around for them pills
Bitch, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Bitch, I'm so trill (What?)
Nigga, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Nigga, I'm so trill (What? What?)
I got my steel, I'll peel
Pullin' up in your grill, I'm so trill
Your girl want Cosmos, Cristeels
And she feelin' around for them pills
Bitch, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Bitch, I'm so trill (What?)
Nigga, I'm trill (You don't hear me though)
Nigga, I'm so trill (What? What?)6Embed
