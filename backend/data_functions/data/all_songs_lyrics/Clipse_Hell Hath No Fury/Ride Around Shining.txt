Ride Around Shining Lyrics
All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuckwagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine (Uh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick, man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snow, man, call me Frosty Lover

This for the hundred-thousand dollar kitted German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
Fuckin' with college bitches with innocent looks like Mýa
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars, I groom 'em well
Dior whore, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floorboard
Enough to start World War
Paradise in reaches, home next to beaches
Hair pressed, blowin' in the wind, shit 'bout long as Jesus
Hostilely speaks the gospel, so match this
Pusha push John P. Kees with these sounds of crackness, uh
The Black Martha Stewart, let me show you how to do it
Break down pies to pieces, make cocaine quiches, uh
Money piles high as my nieces
Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ass
Rolex presidential, bitch, feel the glass
All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuckwagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine (Uh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick, man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snow, man, call me Frosty Lover

Hah, it's that look that astounds
Life's a circus, I parade the six through these clowns
The crown is vacant, I'm takin' the proper steps
I'm takin' them Poppa steps, they prayin' for my downfall
Is it the bling? The king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Franck Muller
The R shape peculiar, it's awesome, laying over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant
Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish where the sharks a-swim
In that opaque linen with the odd-colored stitching
V12 on the Modena, you can see the pistons
HREs on it, mami, see it glisten
When I— make all of her twist like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin'
Top stole, push soul, gotta drive it like pole position 'til my soul is risen
All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuckwagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine (Uh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick, man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snow, man, call me Frosty Lover

Welcome to the world of Rollies
VS diamonds and that fifty-thousand dollar showpiece got me shinin'
First nigga holler, "Show me"
Let that nine millimeter turn a fella ghostly
Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You fuckin' faggots, you need to raise your glass and toast me
Niggas can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, chrome rims with stallion insignia
Listen, youngin, you've only just begun
"You'll understand when you're older," said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down
And proceed with caution
Carousel of horses with dual exhaustion, 'fess up
Youngin, you'll always be next up
Go against I, forever play catch-up, nigga
All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuckwagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine (Uh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick, man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snow, man, call me Frosty Lover5Embed
