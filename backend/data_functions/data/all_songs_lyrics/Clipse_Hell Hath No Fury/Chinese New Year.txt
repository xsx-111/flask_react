Chinese New Year Lyrics
I'm at your door, your eyes are like, "Why are you here?"
Judgin' by my steel, I got somethin' to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca

Mask on face, Glock in hand
I was in and out of homes like the Orkin Man
Never listen to my parents like an orphan, man
Strong finger on the trigger like it's in dwarf's hands
Confiscate goodies like Repo Man Sam
Make nigga kick that can
Fall victim to the Klick Klack Klan
My vixen eat your face like she Ms. Pac-Man
My wish her command, ugh
ADTs ain't stop me
Simple like ABC's
Snip, cut, yank just as easy as one, two, three
Breakin' and entry so elementary
Get what the hustlers get for tryna do what the hustlers do
Give up the cash 'fore I turn you Cookie Monster blue
And your man and them for tryna be hustlers too
Ernie and Bert, I bet them bullet holes burnin' and hurt, uh
I'm at your door, your eyes are like, "Why are you here?"
Judgin' by my steel, I got somethin' to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca

Let's play cops and robbers
And watch Heckler & Koch turn cops to martyrs
As well as niggas with plots to rob us
Try me, I'll turn this motherfucker into Shottas
With them 911s revvin'
Gunfire leave bredren remains like it's 9/11
They fear the sounds of rounds dispensin'
That clack up make 'em back up like it's invisible fencing
When I picture bits and pieces
Of bone chip and flesh, it tears me to pieces
Cooperate, escaping's useless
Trust me, I'm your friend, I will talk you through this
Trick-or-treat niggas with hoods want the goods
I feel like Robin Hood when I share it with my hoods
Don't forget, he who plays hero gets hit
Don't let the nine mil' riddle your wits, smartypants
I'm at your door, your eyes are like, "Why are you here?"
Judgin' by my steel, I got somethin' to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca

Sympathy? I feel none, when you hear that humming
Common sense'll tell you duck and get the fuck outta harm's way
You dying'll absolutely make my day
Why he had to go look cool? But he wasn't, so he got betrayed
This is what I did to him, nozzle with a SIG to him
Hurried out his crib, before that, took everything
Powder to pocket change, even the lint
Left the boy layin' with his skin
If I didn't get you right, you better hold your pistol tight
When we meet in the afterlife
Coldchain on the block when it bleed
Rosco P, young G, I don't speak, I just squeeze
97 P'll make you drop to your knees
Before you know it
You'll be floating to a better place, your soul feelin' free
I'm young, Black and I just don't give a fuck
Big burner on my waist, drugs in the trunk
Sitting high in a truck, call me luck, come press me
I'm at your door, your eyes are like, "Why are you here?"
Judgin' by my steel, I got somethin' to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca
Brrat, brrat, brrat, brrat
Brrat, brrat, ca-ca-ca-ca8Embed
