Dirty Money Lyrics
Yo, what up, ma? I got a pocket full of stinkies
Let's go spend these right quick
(What's that?)

All my fly bitches like (Dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (Dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (Dirty money, dirty money)
Don't it spend so right? (Dirty money, dirty money)
Now, let's go shopping, let's go chill (Dirty money, dirty money)
Let's go buy the new Louboutin heels (Dirty money, dirty money)
Ass in La Perla, ears full of pearls (Dirty money, dirty money)
Damn, dirty money know how to treat the girls (Dirty money, dirty money)

Give a little, take a little, ma, check the dealy
Most niggas is will-nots, you're dealing with a willy
3D faces on them crisp new billies
Got Benji lookin all googley-eyed and silly
The glitter chill got your mind seeing milli-mills
I'm seven-figure, the bigger, your thoughts are literal
See, I don't blame you, cashmeres that you feels
Picturin' the fortune, you just tryna spin the wheel
Brain like Teri, face like Eva
I ain't forgettin' them other Housewives neither
Two-seaters, back of the trunk, two fevers
Stayin' up 'til 2 A.M. to watch Cheaters
Long as I'm nice with the flame and the flass
I don't mind keepin' you up on them must-haves
Pito pumps, Gucci slouch bag
Now tell me, is that dirty money really that bad?
All my fly bitches like (Dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (Dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (Dirty money, dirty money)
Don't it spend so right? (Dirty money, dirty money)
Now, let's go shopping, let's go chill (Dirty money, dirty money)
Let's go buy the new Louboutin heels (Dirty money, dirty money)
Ass in La Perla, ears full of pearls (Dirty money, dirty money)
Damn, dirty money know how to treat the girls (Dirty money, dirty money)

We could trick tuiton, you could be the vixen
You could front for your girlfriends, I ain't trippin'
You done got you a rapper, I see your vision
And one of the best too, that's ambition
You could tell me 'bout your day, I'll pretend I listen
And you ain't gotta love me, just be convincin'
I don't ask much, some ashes on the cuff
And that silver bullet, automatic or the clutch
Nah, mama, hush, you ain't even gotta speak
Just put it on your charge, checkmate your feet
Compliments of me, take the bitter with the sweet
And we can get this money like it's fallin' out a tree, uh
Come spend a dollar, yeah, bathe in it, wallow
Seventeen-five, for the low, tell 'em holla
Love you in Escada, Jimmy Choo, Prada
Snow White your life, how's that for starters?
All my fly bitches like (Dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (Dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (Dirty money, dirty money)
Don't it spend so right? (Dirty money, dirty money)
Now, let's go shopping, let's go chill (Dirty money, dirty money)
Let's go buy the new Louboutin heels (Dirty money, dirty money)
Ass in La Perla, ears full of pearls (Dirty money, dirty money)
Damn, dirty money know how to treat the girls (Dirty money, dirty money)

To my fly ghetto bitches with their hair shop talk
Braggin' to their hairdresser 'bout that shit he bought
To my South Beach bitches with that sassy walk
Who ain't tryna hear nothin' if you don't ride Porsche
To my get-money niggas gettin' paper for sure
Trickin' grands up in Louis for the love of the sport
I tell you get money, money, take money, money, uh
Dope money, money's great money, money, what?

Before I'ma bicker with you, ma, I'ma switch you
I fly 'em in quick, I fly 'em out even quicker
By no means am I in love with a stripper
You understand that, then you fit in the glass slipper
Travel abroad, sittin' in G4s
Changin' the weather, when it rains, it pours
And the crib is ajoined with French doors
You ride for your boy, then anything is yours
All my fly bitches like (Dirty money, dirty money)
All my stripper bitches like (Dirty money, dirty money)
All my college hoes like (Dirty money, dirty money)
Don't it spend so right? (Dirty money, dirty money)
Now, let's go shopping, let's go chill (Dirty money, dirty money)
Let's go buy the new Louboutin heels (Dirty money, dirty money)
Ass in La Perla, ears full of pearls (Dirty money, dirty money)
Damn, dirty money know how to treat the girls (Dirty money, dirty money)4Embed
