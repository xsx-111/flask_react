Wamp Wamp (What It Do) Lyrics
Man, I showed up, pimpin' ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the 'dro up, my cup Mo'ed up
Bitch, don't just stand there with your nose up, c'mon
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Huh, wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Huh, wamp wamp, what it do?

No hotter flow dropper since Poppa
You penny-ante niggas, see, I know copper
Left the game on a high note, flow opera
Pusha still got them keys, I can unlock ya
See that watch on the sleeve? Call it show-stopper
Nigga ball around the world, call me globe-trotter
Trick dollar, ask what I feel, nada
Give a bitch yellow fever, all these gold bottles
And late models, I lean throttles
Roof back with the coupe black, player think he need goggles
Look mama, a m√≠ fly papa
Strictly Bathing Ape, Ice Cream and BBC rocker (Yuugh)
So proper, hammer time, gun cocker
Top shotta, me hesitate none, pop ya
Egg shell on the scale for my snow coppers
Don't ask what I sell, shit, I'm Bet' Crocker
Man, I showed up, pimpin' ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the 'dro up, my cup Mo'ed up
Bitch, don't just stand there with your nose up, c'mon
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Huh, wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Huh, wamp wamp, what it do?

Uh, mirror mirror, who's the fairest?
Tricked a buck fifty on that horse and carriage
Must admit, nothing like these karats
Them hoes holla back just like they parrots
Down to the watches, alligator strap
Six different time zones, I don't set her back
Seventeen a brick, yeah, run and tell 'em that
I got the wamp wamp, when I move it, it's still damp
Mildew-ish, I heat it, it turns bluish
It cools to a tight wad, the Pyrex is Jewish
I get paper, it seems I get foolish
Take it to Jacob and play "Which hue's the bluest?"
We ain't browsing, luxurious housing
Pull up so mean with the angel bowing
Or with the emblem bearing the stallion
European custom, the leather's Italian
Man, I showed up, pimpin' ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the 'dro up, my cup Mo'ed up
Bitch, don't just stand there with your nose up, c'mon
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Huh, wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Huh, wamp wamp, what it do?

Yuugh, so much glamour, that I can't stand the
Bright from the ice, the chain xenon lamp ya
Impression in ya mind like a freeze frame camera
The white tape tight like ya seen on Pampers
What's under the couch probably free up Santa
Whatever it cost, baby, we got answers
Line outside full of Jo-Jo Dancers
"We Got it for Cheap," that's the Re-Up anthem

By far the coldest, '06 Lotus
Zero to sixty, hocus pocus
The Feds don't know so they stick their noses
While we off the coast, proposing toasts-es
Hoes and more shit, the family close knit
And deep like the Hutu, you cockroaches
Just like the flow, the four's ferocious
I'll tuck you in homie, "Buenos noches"
Man, I showed up, pimpin' ya cold up
I head straight to the bar just to post up
I roll the 'dro up, my cup Mo'ed up
Bitch, don't just stand there with your nose up, c'mon
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Huh, wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Wamp wamp, what it do? (What it do?)
Huh, wamp wamp, what it do?6Embed
