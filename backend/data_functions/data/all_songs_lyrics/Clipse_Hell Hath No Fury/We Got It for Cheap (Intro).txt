We Got It for Cheap (Intro) Lyrics
Ayy, papá
Re-Up Gang Records
That hold-the-door music (Got it for cheap)
You know, Broadway, daddy
Manteca, crack, hooray
Toda la vaina que hay aqui arriba
En Uptown baby, otra vez (G-g-got it for cheap)
Clipse, "Hell Hath No Fury", B
Let 'em know, daddy, Mr. Lee, haha

Fear him, as soon as you hear him
Upon my arrival, the dope dealers cheer him (Got it for cheap)
Just like a revival, the verse tends to steer 'em
Through a life in the fast lane, I German engineer 'em
No serum can cure all the pain I've endured
From crack to rap to back to selling it pure
For every record I potentially sell in the store
It's like Mecca to the dealer that's selling it raw
So many deceive ya
I'm more in touch with the keys, move over Alicia
I force feed ya the metric scale
Rap's like child's play, my show and tell
Within each verse, you see the truth's unveiled
They manufacture proof as they lie to themselves
Puppets on the string like a yo-yo
Bouncing like a pogo, they praying I never go solo
(G-g-got it for cheap)
Do it (Got it for cheap)
I fuck with the real niggas, daddy (Got it, got it for cheap)
Fuck these bitch ass niggas (G-g-got it for cheap)
Lo' tiene temblando tu a todito ello, loco (G-g-got it for cheap)
(Got it, got it for cheap, got it for cheap)
They just wanna be you, loco (G-g-got it for cheap)
G-g-got it for cheap, g-g-got it for cheap
Fucking envidioso (G-g-got it for cheap)
Bunch of palomos (G-g-got it, got it, got it, got it)

The wool's removed and now I see (Yeah)
My leg was pulled, the joke's on me (Haha)
So heartbreakin', like lovin' a whore
Might hurt ya once, but never no more
It's like tryin to fly but they clippin' your wings
And that's exactly why the caged bird sings
Who can nickname it? The shame rings true
Seems to me reparations are overdue
I done been to the top, I done sipped the juice
And with that being said, bird crumbs'll never do
Even on my last, not a penny in the bank
I'ma stand on my own, so thanks, but no thanks
Keep the pranks as I bid farewell (Uh)
I gotta answer to Marcus and Jennelle
And to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so
If ever I had millions, never would you push blow, never (G-g-got it for cheap)
Ay, dios mío, malicioso (Got it for cheap)
The handcuffs are off now, daddy (Got it, got it for cheap)
(G-g-got it for cheap)
Entiende, cabroncito (G-g-got it for cheap)
Everyone must pay now (Got it, got it for cheap, got it for cheap)
Bunch of mamagüevos, toditos (G-g-got it for cheap)
Re-Up Gang Records (G-g-got it for cheap)
It's your world now, daddy (G-g-got it, got it, got it, got it)

I'm the best since he died, and he lied
The spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad
CPR Pusha, the flow tends to revive
Pullin' the covers back, I expose what you disguise
My presence is felt, the pressure is on
A 4'11" Cuban helped us weather the storm
Pyrex and powder, it was back to the norm
Through all the adversity, the fury was born

Niggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture
Even ask your mama, she'll tell you that blood's thicker
And I don't know how them other niggas built
And I don't know if ever they feel guilt
Or maybe niggas just too high on they stilts
But this one's on me, I'ma view it as spilt milk
Grandma, look at me, I'm turnin' the other cheek
It's the R-E-U-P G-A-N-G (G-g-got it for cheap)
From the street to this música (Got it for cheap)
We get this money, we never stop (Got it, got it for cheap)
Record sales to digital scales (G-g-got it for cheap)
It's whatever (G-g-got it for cheap)
We always at home (Got it, got it for cheap, got it for cheap)
"Hell Hath No Fury" (G-g-got it for cheap)
El sueño de un jodedor tratando de logralizarlo (G-g-got it for cheap)
Mr. Lee (G-g-got it, got it, got it, got it)5Embed
