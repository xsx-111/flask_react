Hello New World Lyrics
Straight crushing you

Hello, new world, here we come
On them Twinkie trains with the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screamin', "I'm on my way"
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by papi, screamin', "It's on its way"
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, "Look out, world, I'm on my way"

I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was sixteen, eyes full of hope
Baggin' up grams at the Hyatt, though
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke (Oh)
At the same time, hidin' from mama, dodgin' the drama
Fuckin' plenty bitches while duckin' a baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, Floetry
Say yes, niggas hear the "yuugh" and they know it's me
Make 'em sick to they stomach how they supposed to be
Sippin' on a fifty-foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where it's supposed to be
Funny how my neighbors don't think it's where I'm supposed to be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roof's on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listenin', envisionin'
Hello, new world, here we come
On them Twinkie trains with the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screamin', "I'm on my way"
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by papi, screamin', "It's on its way" (Yeah)
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, "Look out, world, I'm on my way"

This goes out to my A-alikes who hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nikes, live a hustler's way of life
In white tees, constantly duckin' from D's
Pumpin' that D arm readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin', stay lookin' over they shoulders
Holdin' them boulders, tryin' to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at you, quote-unquote famous rapper
Who turn positive, try to tell you how to live
But this information, I must pass to the homies
If hustlin' is a must, be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign cars, stick shift, six gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from cryin', visitin'
You behind that glass while you await sentencin'
'Cause the judge is sayin' life like it ain't someone's life
Hello, new world, here we come
On them Twinkie trains with the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screamin', "I'm on my way"
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by papi, screamin', "It's on its way"
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, "Look out, world, I'm on my way"

Yo, what up? What up?
This your man Grimey from downtown Norfolk
Just want y'all to know it's 'bout time for us to come up and make a change, man
They keep tryna keep us down
But that ain't the way to be, man
It's 'bout time for us to get it together, man
Everybody else put they shit together
Why the niggas can't get together, put their money together?
Hustlers come together with hustlers, know what I'm saying?
This ain't just for the players in VA
This for players all over the world, this is Grimey

Time's a-wasting, niggas doin' so much hatin'
Free your heart and show your greatness
I, like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin' my patience
Still, you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my niggas rise up
Get that money, put the nines up
Piggyback from out the ghetto 'fore time's up, niggas rush
Hello, new world, here we come
On them Twinkie trains with the hood screaming, "We on our way"
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screamin', "I'm on my way"
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by papi, screamin', "It's on its way"
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, "Look out, world, I'm on my way"7Embed
