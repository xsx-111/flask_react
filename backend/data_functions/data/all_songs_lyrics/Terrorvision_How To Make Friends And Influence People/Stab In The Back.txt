Stab In The Back LyricsPowdered rock stars just add water
Pop up a treat just like they ought to
Little bit old and cliched sought of
Number one hit punch in the order
Stop right there, Stab in the back
There's something you ain't got
Yes you definitely lack, originality
Heavy politicians, heavy laws
Opening champagne and shutting doors
Deny reality, just invent a clause
What majority when you know the choice ain't yours
Stop right there, Stab in the back
There's something you ain't got
Yes you definitely lack, personality
Media, mafia, mafia, don
You thinking that you're safe now Maxwell's silver hammer's gone
Propaganda, more like proper lies
You're more than a fool than I am if you think the truth's alive
Without morality, no morality
Stop right there, Stab in the back
There's something you ain't got
Yes you definitely lack...
Stop right there, Stab in the back
There's something you ain't got
Yes you definitely lack...
