Middleman LyricsYou know I couldn't be me, if it wasn't for you
I feel like shit and look like plastic, but I'll get through
You know its plain to see what's going to do
As long as it don't get too drastic then we can't lose
Don't blame the middleman, come to me
I'll tell you what I can, all you need
Cut out the middleman, wait and see...
It was you that told me, the aliens had landed
And it was you that told me, the end had just begun
Don't blame the middleman, come to me
I'll tell you what I can, all you need
Cut out the middleman, wait and see...
But now we're in this thing together
You can't escape I've got you trapped deep inside
You said you'd stay with me forever
Where are you now when I need you as my alibi
You left me all alone, in my hour of need
I tried to explain the situation, but they don't believe me
Don't blame the middleman, come to me
I'll tell you what I can, all you need
Cut out the middleman, wait and see...Embed
