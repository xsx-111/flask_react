Ten Shades Of Grey LyricsTimes we spent cheating and lying
Wondering when we would be back by your side again
Hoping and praying to get through the day
I need your attention to see through the fray
It's night again all the time
Shadows are lurking but I can't find mine
People look at me as they flood through the door
I need your attention not theirs anymore
And the light from the candle goes dim
As I slip deeper down from the brim
The people are fading away
As I slip into colours then ten shades of grey
If I don't last this one tell them when I've gone
That playing with you was incredible funEmbed
