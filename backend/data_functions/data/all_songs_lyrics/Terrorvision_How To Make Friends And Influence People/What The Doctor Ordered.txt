What The Doctor Ordered LyricsI went off to the doctors for the open plan surgery
He said I just can't believe what's lying here in front of me
It looks like what you couldn't drink you'd just have to smoke
You've been living in a frying pan, what you need is health
So I burgled a few houses took the candy from the baby
In search of the prescription that was driving me crazy
The policeman turned the corner looking down at me
The judge said I hope to God that you're sorry
You need help, that's what you need
You need help, can't get it from me
You need help, something you got or you ain't
You need help
So I started off my sentence in a nine foot cell
I was feeling pretty cheated, I was feeling unwell
The bunk below guy said there's one thing see
What you really need is the need to be free
You need a plan, that's what you need
Y ou need a plan, can't get it from me
You need a plan, something you got or you ain't
You need a plan
But what I don't want is you telling me..
I had the route, had the escape, I had the plan worked out
Everything I thought I'd need or thereabouts
Suddenly it's obvious, it's plain to see
That what I don't need is you telling me
Don't need your health
Don't need your help
Don't need your plan
I don't need anything
What I don't want is you telling meEmbed
