Stop The Bus LyricsI've sold the bus man 'cos I bought myself a train
In a village that was man but it's now a motorway
The house has gone man, 'cos we couldn't afford the rates
Only a few left now, where the new age stayers stay
I've got no job man 'cos I couldn't afford the taxes
And I can't work away 'cos the world's being run by nazis
They say, stay put 'cos there's no room at the inn
Don't try the if, but, don't ring us no don't ring
Stop right here, 'cos I know where I'm going to
Stop right there, you don't know where I've been
Stop right here, 'cos I know where I'm going to
Stop right there, you don't know where I've been
Stop the bus, I live here
Stop the bus, I live here
I feel sad man 'cos we're victims of the victims
Who don't give a damn, just say they're victims of the system
They say, what's the point when the future's a thing of the past
You might as well give in they don't build history to last
Stop right here, 'cos I know where I'm going to
Stop right there, you don't know where I've been
Stop right here, 'cos I know where I'm going to
Stop right there, you don't know where I've been
Stop right here..
Stop right here, 'cos I know where I'm going to
Stop right there, you don't know where I've been
Stop right here, 'cos I know where I'm going to
Stop right there, you don't know where I've beenEmbed
