What Makes You Tick? LyricsI'll find out just what it is
I'll find out what makes you tick tock tick tock
I'll find out just what it is
I'll find out what makes you tick tock tick tock
You've got no chance of getting bored
You've got our consciences to play with
You've got the masses and the hordes
Just waiting for you to tell them how to live
I can take my time, take my time
Take my time, take my time (x3)
I've got the time to take my time (x3)
I've got the time to...
I'll find out just what it is
I'll find out what makes you tick tock tick tock
You built your house on promised land
You've got no chance of getting moved along
You've got the whole world in your hands
A million people trying to sing your song
I can take my time, take my time
Take my time, take my time (x3)
I've got the time to take my time (x3)
I've got the time to (x4)
I'll find out
Take the time
From now I'm never getting bored
'Cos I've just stolen what they wouldn't give
And now I'm happier than before
With no-one showing me the way to
Tick tock...Embed
