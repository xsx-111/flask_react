Some People Say LyricsSome people say that what I know should be kept secret
Some people say I don't know anything at all
Some people say that what I do could be dangerous
Some people say I don't do anything at all
Some people say this is a song that needs the drums in
Some people say no it's a song for the bass
Some people say that they can't stand what they're hearing
Some people say who gives a damn what they say
Do you think I care, do you think I care
Do you think I know or I'm aware
Do you think I care what you say when I'm oblivious
Some people say that I look just like my father
Some people say I've got my mother's eyes
Some people say I'm like my brother 'cos I'm honest and truthful
Some people say they know my brother's just another lie
Do you think I care, do you think I care
Do you think I know or I'm aware
Do you think I care what you say when I'm oblivious
Some people say that we should let the search continue
Some people say just what the hell's going on
Do you think I care, do you think I care
Do you think I know or I'm aware
Do you think I care what you say when I'm obliviousEmbed
