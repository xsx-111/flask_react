As I Sit Down to Play the Organ at the Notre Dame Cathedral LyricsBye, bye, bye, my baby
Now it's time, time, time for me to go to
Work, work, work
So you might want to make your way from here
Bye, bye, bye, my baby
Now it's time, time, time for me to go to
Work, work, work
So you might want to make your way from here
Bye, bye, bye, my baby
Now it's time, time, time for me to go to
Work, work, work
So you might want to make your way from here
Bye, bye, bye, my baby
Now it's time, time, time for me to go to
Work, work, work
So you might want to make your way from here
Finish up your beer
Bye, bye, bye, baby, now
Time, time, time, me to go, work, work, work
You might want to make your way from here
Bye, bye, bye, baby, now
Time, time, time, me to go, work, work, work
You might want to make your way from here
Bye, bye, bye, my baby, now
It's time, time, time for me to go, to work, work, work
So you might want to make your way from here
Bye, bye, bye, my baby, now
It's time, time, time for me to go, to work, work, work
So you might want to make your way from here
Finish up your beer
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
As I sit down to play the organ at the Notre Dame Cathedral
As I sit down to play the organ at the Notre Dame Cathedral
You know you're gonna be upstaged, again and again
You know you're gonna be upstaged, upstaged by Him
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
I got faith, I got faith, I got a deep, abiding faith
I got faith, I got faith, I got a deep, abiding faith
That in that sea of faces, that sea of believing faces
(We got faith)
There's always one face that's here to escape the rain
She is here from Japan
She is here from Milan
She is here, time on her hands
As I sit down to play the organ at the Notre Dame Cathedral
As I sit down to play the organ at the Notre Dame Cathedral
You know you're gonna be upstaged, again and again
You know you're gonna be upstaged, upstaged by Him
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
I got faith, I got faith, I got a deep, abiding faith
I got faith, I got faith, I got a deep, abiding faith
That in that sea of faces, that sea of believing faces
(We got faith)
There's always one face that just might be game
She is here from Brazil
She is here from Seville
She is here searching out some thrills
And as we walk along the Seine
And as we walk past cafes and restaurants
And as we walk past museums and monuments
I invite her up to my apartment to escape the rain
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
Bye, bye, bye, my baby
Now it's time, time, time for me to go to
Work, work, work, so you had better finish up your beer
Bye, bye, bye, my baby
Now it's time, time, time for me to go to
Work, work, work
So you might want to make your way from here
Finish up your beer
As I sit down to play the organ at the Notre Dame Cathedral
It doesn't matter that I'm upstaged, upstaged again
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
The congregation sways, the congregation says amen
The congregation sways, and says amen, amen again
But my message is lost on them, lost on all of them
It only reaches one of them
It only reaches one of them
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe, I believe
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujahEmbed
