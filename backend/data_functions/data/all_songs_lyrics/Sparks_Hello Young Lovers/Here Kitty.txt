Here Kitty LyricsHere kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Hark I hear them calling for me fireman, oh fireman
Hark I hear them calling for me hurry, hurry fireman
I climb the Eucalyptus, bring her kitty back
I climb the Douglas fir and bring her kitty back
I climb the Juniper and bring her kitty back
“How can I thank you for your bringing kitty back?”
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, here kitty

Climbing, climbing they exhort me
Hurry, hurry fireman
Crying, crying loud and softly
Every cat’s a crazy man
I’m at your service, ma’am, and here’s your kitty back
I’m at your service ma’am, and here’s your kitty back
“How can I thank you for your bringing kitty back?”
“How can I ever thank you, ever pay you back?”
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
A four-alarmer and the circus is ablaze
Panicky people run out madly through the haze
I fight my way into the Big Top, wipe my eyes
There stands a tiger trainer, lovely, hear her cry
She points up to the high-wire, there a tiger stands
“Oh help me, help me, bring my tiger down, dear man”
“If you will save him, I will be yours every night”
I climb the pole and look the tiger in the eye
I climb the pole and look the tiger in the eye
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here kitty, here kitty
Cats have struck a silent bargain with young women with no man
Treat us, feed us royally, and tonight you’ll have that man
Though a lowly fireman, for tonight I am that man
Virtue is its own reward, but tonight I am that man
Virtue is its own reward, but tonight I am that man
Virtue is its own reward, but tonight I am that manEmbed
