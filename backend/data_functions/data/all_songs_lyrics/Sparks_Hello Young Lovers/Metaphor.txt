Metaphor LyricsA metaphor is a glorious thing
A diamond ring
The first day of summer
A metaphor is a breath of fresh air
A turn-on
An aphrodisiac
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Use them wisely
Use them well
And you'll never know the hell of loneliness
A metaphor is a popular place
A pocket space
A multiplex showing
A remake whose action is louder than words
She whispers "can we be going, going?"
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Use them wisely
Use them well
And you'll never know the hell of loneliness
Whose up for a metaphor?
(We're up for a metaphor)
Are you chicks up for a metaphor?
(Yes, we're up for a metaphor)
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't mix them
(We, we, we won't mix them)
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't mix them
(We wouldn't dream of mixing them)
Use them wisely
Use them well
And you'll never know the hell of loneliness
A metaphor is a glorious thing
A diamond ring
The first day of summer
A metaphor is a fresh air
A turn-on
An aphrodisiac
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
A metaphor is a glorious thing
A diamond ring
The first day of summer
A metaphor is a breath fresh air
A turn-on
An aphrodisiac
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Use them wisely
Use them well
And you'll never know the hell of loneliness
A metaphor is a glorious thing
(Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig)
A metaphor is a breath of fresh air
(Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig)
A metaphor is a glorious thing
(Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig)
A metaphor is a breath of fresh air
(Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig)
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Chicks dig, dig, d-i-g, dig, dig metaphors
Use them wisely
Use them well
And you'll never know the hell of lonelinessEmbed
