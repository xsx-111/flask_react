The Very Next Fight LyricsThe very next fight
I have over you
Will end up the same
It's always the same
The very next fight
From out of the blue (it's always the same)
Will end up the same
It's always the same (it's always the same)
Some idiot staring at your legs, I know
You quietly tell me I should let it go
But how can I let it go
When I can't control myself
How can I let it go
When I cannot help myself
When I can't control myself
When I cannot help myself
When I can't control myself
When I cannot help myself
It's always the same
It's always the same
It's always the same
It's always the same
The very next fight
I have over you
Will end up the same
It's always the same
The very next fight
From out of the blue (it's always the same)
Will end up the same
It's always the same (it's always the same)
Blood on the floor of some posh restaurant
Deep down I'm sure this is what you want
And what you want, is what I want
What you want is what I want
And what you want, is what I want
And what you want is what I want
It's always the same
It's always the same
It's always the same
It's always the same
Open displays of affection
Open displays of affection
Open displays of affection
Open displays of affection
The very next fight
From out of the blue (it's always the same)
Will end up the same
It's always the same (it's always the same)
Some idiot staring at your legs, I know
You quietly tell me I should let it go
But how can I let it go
When I can't control myself
How can I let it go
When I can not him myself
The very next fight
I have over you
Will end up the same
It's always the same
The very next fight (it's always the same)
From out of the blue (it's always the same)
Will end up the same (it's always the same)
It's always the same (it's always the same)
Open displays of affection
Open displays of affection
Open displays of affection
Open displays of affectionEmbed
