Dick Around LyricsAll I do now, is dick around
All I do now is dick around, dick around
Every day, every day, every day
Every night, every night, every night
Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day
Every night, every night, every night, every night, every night

Overtime, more overtime
I’m conscientious by design
To reach the heights of academe
To be the captain of the team
To CEO a thousand who
Will do the things I say to do
And I will make a lot of bread
And you will find me good in bed
I will push, I will pull, I will push, I will pull
Pull a couple strings and find myself atop the corporation

Tailored to the maximum
I send another fax to them
A parking place, a new Corvette
A manicure, a private jet
A stock incentive busting out
"A phone call, sir." Well, say I’m out
"Your lady friend." Well, put her through
"Uh, listen, dear, I’m through with you."
"Through with you, through with you, through you, through with you."
Yes, I think I got the point and bang, there goes my motivation
What to do, what to do, what to do, what to do?
All that I can think of was 'I’m tendering my resignation'
But all I do now, is dick around
All I do now is dick around, dick around

All I do now is dick around
When the sun goes up and the moon comes out
When the leaves are green and the leaves are brown
All I do now is dick around
I’ve got so much to do, gotta pick things up, gotta see things through
My, how the time does fly, gotta wave hello to a passer-by
All I do now is dick around, when the sun goes up and the moon comes out
When the leaves are green and the leaves are brown
All I do now is dick around
I’ve got so much do, gotta pick things up, gotta see things through
My, how the time does fly, gotta wave hello to a passer-by
All I do now is dick around, when the sun goes up and the moon comes out
When the leaves are green and the leaves are brown
All I do now is dick around

Think about the recent past
The cynics said too good to last
But she could change her mind again
Oh, no, this movie said "The End"
So I will go about my day
Just dicking round, my métier
And realize that life is change
And furniture to rearrange
Why the hell, why the hell, why the hell, why the hell?
Why the hell did she desert you when you were so influential?
Why the hell, why the hell, why the hell, why the hell?
Why did she desert you when you told her she was so essential?
Pull yourself up off the ground
You’ve started liking being down
The persecution feels cool
The subtle feel of garden tools
But what about that other life
‘Cause this is more an afterlife
Seducing you each night and day
You’re never gonna break away
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Knowing that from now on what you do is strictly non-essential
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
Knowing that from now on no one wonders if you’ve got potential
All I do now is dick around
The sun goes up and the moon goes down
The leaves are green the leaves are brown
And all I do is dick around
All I do is dick around
The sun goes up and the moon goes down
The leaves are green the leaves are brown
And all I do is dick around
Why the hell, why the hell, why the hell, why the hell?
Why the hell did she desert you when you were so influential?
Why the hell, why the hell, why the hell, why the hell?
Why did she desert you when you told her she was so essential?
But all I do now, is dick around
All I do now is dick around, dick around
Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day
Every night, every night, every night, every night, every night 
But all I do now is dick around
All I do now is dick around, dick around
And all I do now is dick around
All I do now is dick around, dick around

Then I got the late-night call
"I really miss you after all
I had a fling and that is all
A stupid fling, then hit the wall
So take me, take me, take me back
"I love the way you scratched my back"
Well, there is something you should know
We might not be simpatico
All I do now, is dick around
All I do now, is dick around
All I do is dick around, the sun goes up, the moon goes down
The leaves are green, the leaves are brown, and all I do is dick around 
"I don’t care what you do, dick around, I will too."
"I don’t care what you do, I’ll dick around next to you."
But all I do now, is dick around
All I do now, is dick around
Dick aroundEmbed
