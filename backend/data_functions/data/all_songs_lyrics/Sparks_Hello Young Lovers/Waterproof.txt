Waterproof LyricsThe rain just falls off of me
The tears just fall off of me
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
The barometric pressure has no relevance to me
The rain just falls off of me
The tears just fall off of me
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
The pressure you're exerting is irrelevant to me
Umbrellas waving, the streets need paving
The rain runs down to the sea
But I'm indifferent, for me it's different
It's all Bahamas to me
The rain just falls off of me
The tears just fall off of me
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
The barometric pressure has no relevance to me
The skies are starting to cloud up
But that won't slow me down
Your eyes are starting to well up
But that won't bring me down
The skies are starting to cloud up
But that won't slow me down
Your eyes are starting to well up
But that won't bring me down, bring me down
Completely dry
Dry as a Navajo in August, see the sky
The mothers just sigh
Send children inside
Hey, mama, you lied
The skies are starting to cloud up
But that won't slow me down
Your eyes are starting to well up
But that won't bring me down
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
The barometric pressure has no relevance to me
The skies are starting to cloud up
But that won't slow me down
Your eyes are starting to well up
But that won't bring me down
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
The pressure you're exerting is irrelevant to me
I see you crying but I'm not buying your Meryl Streep mimicry
It's misdirected, your voice inflected
For maximum sympathy
Niagara Falls
Romantic getaway for lovers of all creeds
They're all agreed, impressive indeed
Till the Falls stall before me
The rain just falls off of me
The tears just fall off of me
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
And nothing of a liquid nature's gonna mess with me
The rain just falls off of me
The tears just fall off of me
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
Water, water everywhere, but not a drop on me
The rain just falls off of me
The tears just fall off of me
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
And nothing of a liquid nature's gonna mess with me
The rain just falls off of me
The tears just fall off of me
'Cause I'm waterproof, I'm waterproof
Water, water everywhere, but not a drop on me
Water, water everywhere, but not a drop on me
The skies are starting to cloud up
But that won't slow me down
Your eyes are starting to well up
But that won't bring me down
The skies are starting to cloud up
But that won't slow me down
Your eyes are starting to well up
But that won't bring me down
Bring me downEmbed
