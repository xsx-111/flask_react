(Baby, Baby) Can I Invade Your Country LyricsOh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and one more thing
Can I invade your country, oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Invade your country?
Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and one more thing
Can I invade your country, oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Invade your country?
Countries, planets, stars
Galaxies so far
Don't let freedom fade
Baby, let's invade
Countries, planets, stars
Galaxies so far
Don't let freedom fade
Baby, let's invade
Countries, planets, stars
Galaxies so far
Don't let freedom fade
Baby, let's invade

Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and one more thing
Can I invade your country, oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
Oh baby, baby, can I invade your country?
