Rock, Rock, Rock LyricsSoft passages, they get you into trouble
They imply a lack of passion and commitment
Soft passages, they get you into trouble
They imply a lack of feeling and of fervor
They get you into trouble, they get you into trouble
They imply a certain air of indecision
Soft passages, they get you into trouble
And since you put a gun to my head
I promise that I'll rock, rock, rock
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me
I will rock, rock, rock
Like a mother, like a mother, like a mother, like a mother
Soft passages can get you into trouble
They imply a lack of passion and commitment
Soft passages can get you into trouble
They get you into trouble, they get you into trouble
I promise that I'll rock, rock, rock
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't leave me
I will rock, rock, rock
Like a mother, like a mother, like a mother, like a mother
A lack of passion, a lack of commitment
A lack of feeling, a lack of fervor
A lack of decisiveness
And since you put a gun to my head
I promise that I'll rock, rock, rock
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me
I will rock, rock, rock
Like a mother, like a mother, like a mother, like a mother
Soft passages, they get you into trouble
They imply a certain faux respectability
A certain measure of weakness
They get you into trouble
A certain level of maturity
I promise that I'll rock, rock, rock
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me
I will rock, rock, rock
Like a mother, like a mother, like a mother, like a mother
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me don't leave me
Like a mother, like a mother, like a mother, like a mother
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me don't leave me
Like a mother, like a mother, like a mother, like a mother
A lack of passion, a lack of commitment
A lack of feeling, a lack of fervor
A lack of decisiveness
And since you put a gun to my head
I promise that I'll rock, rock, rock
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me
I will rock, rock, rock
Like a mother, like a mother, like a mother, like a mother
And since you put, and since you put
And since you put, and since you put
And since you put a gun to my head
I promise that I'll rock, rock, rock
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me
I will rock, rock, rock
Like a mother, like a mother, like a mother, like a mother
I promise that I'll rock, rock, rock
Don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me, don't leave me
I will rock, rock, rock
Rock, rock, rockEmbed
