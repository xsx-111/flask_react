Spent Lyrics
Oh, fuck...
Man, you were all assuming something
And I was gonna sing something
Until it got to your machine
I was gonna sing something
And I was gonna sing something
Until it got to your machine
I'll just wait for you, I'll call you back
(Friday, 4:22 AM)

All my life
All my time
Oh, it's got a price
Oh, gonna pay for mine

I know you really care
I know you really care

All my friends, they got
Old apathy in the brain
They got no ideas in their heads
They got no path that I can see, oh
Don't you think that I don't blame 'em?
Don't you think that I can't save them?
Don't you think that I don't want 'em?
Don't you think that I ain't one of 'em?
One of 'em
One of 'em
One of 'em

I know you really care
I know you really care

Hello, leave a message
No, fuck that
Pick up the phone, man
It's not my contest
You fucked up on me, man

You're just another X now
You're just another X now
You're just another X now
You're just another X now
You're just another X now
You're just another X now
You're just another X now
You're just another X nowEmbed
