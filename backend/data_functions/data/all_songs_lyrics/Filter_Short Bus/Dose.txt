Dose Lyrics
I believe in something else
Now go bother someone else
Stick your fingers in your book
Take a better second look, you crook

I hate it when you breach my space
And I hate it when you preach your case
And you should go down, down
Save someone else

I think I should warn you
I think I should tell
What you've been doing
It makes you go to hell

I hate it when you preach your case
It makes me want to stick my dick in your face
And you should go down, down
Save someone else

Can your preacher bring me down?
Oh, I don't think so
Oh, and I hate it when you breach my space
And I hate it when you preach your case
And you should go down, down
Save someone else
And you should go down, down
Save someone elseEmbed
