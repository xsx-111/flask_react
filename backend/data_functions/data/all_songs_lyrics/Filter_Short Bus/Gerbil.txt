Gerbil Lyrics
He gets out of bed
He goes to the room
He turns on the set
He is as smart as a broom

Hey you, brainless
How'd you lose us?
Hey you, thoughtless
How'd you screw us?

It starts on his head
He tries not to hear
It gets worse instead
He checks out of here

Hey you, dumbass
How'd you lose us?
Hey you, headless
Why'd you screw us?
