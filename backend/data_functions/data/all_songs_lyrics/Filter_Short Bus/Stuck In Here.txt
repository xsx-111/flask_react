Stuck In Here Lyrics
Once again, I'm stuck in here
Once again, I'm in low gear
Once again, I have a fear
Once again, I'm stuck in here

Hey, just close the door
Think back and just ignore
Hey, just close your eyes
Think back and realize

Oh no, I'm stuck in here
Oh no, still stuck in here

What makes you think that it's okay?
Don't start it off, don't relate
Take the job but not the pay
Forget the hours but not the day

Hey, just close your eyes
Think back and realize
Hey, just close the door
Back up and just ignore
Oh no, I'm stuck in here
Oh no, still stuck in here1Embed
