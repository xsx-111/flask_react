Under Lyrics
I got empty point to make
It's about a faith
An empty point of view
It's stinky through and through
So you think you got some problems?
So you think you got it bad?
Good boy gone bad
So sorry, so sad

Makes you wonder if you can
It takes you, puts you in a can
One thing I'm gonna do
Something you don't wanna view

This is my world
This is mine
This is my world
This is mine

I got a fresh opinion now
I can tell you how
I think it's best just to take it and go under
Oh, take some, swallow, you can't miss
Lets you spend some time in bliss
Oh, come on down
Oh, come on down
Oh, welcome
This is my world
This is mine
This is my world
This is all mine
Oh, it's all mine
Oh, it's all mine

Oh, this is my world
This is mine
This is my world
It's all mine

It's all mine
It's all mineEmbed
