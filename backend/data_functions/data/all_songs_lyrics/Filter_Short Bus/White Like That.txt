White Like That Lyrics
One thing is for sure, I don't need it
Makes my life a war, what a bore
Don't you understand?
It wasn't even my plan
I guess you just can't see
What you do when you blame it all on me

(White like that, I'm white like that)
It's all the same
(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same

Said one thing and mean another, yeah
Who are you gonna lose?
Oh, who are you gonna choose?
What you think I'm gonna do?
What you thinking?

(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same thing
(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same game
Oh, who's gonna lose?
So who's gonna lose?
They call me white trash
They call me white trash

(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same
(I'm white like that, white like that)
It's all the same game

So who's gonna lose?
So who's gonna lose?
So who's gonna lose?
So, so who's gonna lose?
Who's gonna lose?Embed
