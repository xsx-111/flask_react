Hey Man Nice Shot Lyrics
I wish I would've met you
Now it's a little late
What you could've taught me
I could've saved some face
They think that your early ending
Was all wrong
For the most part, they're right
But look how they all got strong
That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot
Good shot, man"
That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot
Good shot, man"

A man has gun
Hey, man, have fun
Nice shot

Now that the smoke's gone
And the air is all clear
Those who were right there
Got a new kind of fear
You'd fight and you were right
But they were just too strong
They'd stick it in your face
And let you smell what they consider wrong
That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot
Good shot, man"
That's why I say, "Hey, man, nice shot
What a good shot, man"

A man has gun
Hey, man, have fun
Nice shot
A man has gun
Hey, man, have fun
Nice shot, man
Nice shot, man

I wish I would have met you
I wish I would have met you
I wish I would have met you
I wish I would have met you
I'd say, "Nice shot"7Embed
