Take Another Lyrics
Said no way, but knew I'd try someday
Sad but true, it still won't wash away

And I can't take you with me
I can't tell you what to do
I got a sieve inside me, I got a pit inside me
I got nowhere point of view

It makes me wanna
Take another piece
Take another piece
Take it out of me
Oh, makes me wanna
Take another piece
Take another piece
Take it out of me, yeah

My ambition fell and hit the ground
Pick those pieces, pick them from the ground

And I can't take you with me
I can't tell you what to do
I got a sieve inside me, I got a pit inside me
I got nowhere point of view
It makes me wanna
Take another piece
Take another piece
Take it out of me
Oh, makes me wanna
Take another piece
Take another piece
Take it out of me

And I can't take you with me
I can't tell you what to do
I got a sieve inside me, I got a pit inside me
I got nowhere point of view

It makes me wanna
Take another piece
Take another piece
Take it out of me
Oh, makes me wanna
Take another piece
Take another piece
Take it out of meEmbed
