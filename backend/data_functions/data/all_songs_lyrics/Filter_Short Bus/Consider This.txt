Consider This Lyrics
I've been thinking about what you said
It's been going 'round in my head
I've been thinking about what you were
It's a messy, messed up blur

And when your con was over
One thing I learned

I think you'd be better off if you were dead
I think you'd be better off if you were dead
I think you'd be better off if you were dead
I think you'd be better off if you were dead

You think your check might last a year
Ain't got no worries, ain't got no fear
You change so fast, you're such a creep
You make me feel so very cheap

There's a guy
He was, uh, prematurely retired
Let's just say that, um, patient
He can answer the "what"
But he can't answer the "how" or "why"
Uh, and, uh, he went up
And when the heist was over
I guess I got burned

I think you'd be better off if you were dead
I think you'd be better off if you were dead
I think you'd be better off if you were dead
I think you'd be better off if you were dead

If you were dead
If you were deadEmbed
