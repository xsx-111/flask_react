So Cool Lyrics
(The bird's right in the fucking beat)
1, 2, 3, 4

You got a bad old habit
Of making people sad
You got a bad old habit
Of making people dead

You thought you were cool?
I don't really understand it
Did you think you were cool?
I don't even understand it

So cool
So cool
So cool
So cool

Hey, it makes it alright
You keep on taking your chances
You killer of mine
Beneath yourself
Just look what you've done
Just take a look
Did you have some fun?
Did you think you were cool?
'Cause I don't even understand it
Did you think you were cool?
I don't really understand it

So cool
So cool
So cool
So cool
So cool
So cool
So cool
So coolEmbed
