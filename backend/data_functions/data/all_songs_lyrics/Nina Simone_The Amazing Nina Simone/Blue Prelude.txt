Blue Prelude LyricsLet me sigh, let me cry
When I'm blue
Let me go way from this lonely town
Won't be long till my song
Will be through
Cause I know I'm on my last go-round
All the love I could steal beg or borrow
Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul
What is love? Only a prelude to sorrow
With a heartbreak ahead for your goal
Here I go, now you know
Why I'm leaving
Got the blues, what can I lose... Goodbye
What is love? Only a prelude to sorrow
With a heartbreak ahead for your goalEmbed
