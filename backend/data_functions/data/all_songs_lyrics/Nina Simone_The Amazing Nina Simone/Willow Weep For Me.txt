Willow Weep For Me Lyrics(1932) Ann Ronell
Willow weep for me, willow weep for me
Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea
Listen to my plea, listen willow weep for me
Gone my lover's dream, lovely summer dream
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream
Sad as I can be - Hear me willow and weep for me
Whisper to the wind to say that love has sinned
To leave my heart aching and making this moan
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone
Weeping willow tree, weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend oh willow and weep for me
To leave my heart aching and making this moan
So none will find me sighing and crying all alone
Weeping willow tree, weep in sympathy
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
When the shadows fall, bend oh willow
Bend oh willow and weep for meEmbed
