The Note You Never Wrote Lyrics
Later on, the story goes
A bottle floated out to sea
After days, when it had found the perfect spot
It opened up

And I read the note that you never wrote to me

After all, I'm sure you know
The Mayor of Baltimore is here
After days now he can finally appear
Now at last he's here

But he never is gonna get my vote
Cause he never is going to get a quote
From the little note that you never wrote to me


Further on, along the line
I was arrested on the shore
Holding papers of governments galore
I was taken in
But I read the note that you never wrote
Yes, I read the note that you never wrote
Ah, I read the note that you never wrote to me

To me
To me
To meEmbed
