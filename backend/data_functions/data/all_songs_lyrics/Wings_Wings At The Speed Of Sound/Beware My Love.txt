Beware My Love Lyrics
Can't say, found out
I can't tell you what it's all about
I don't know, who does?
I'll tell you to
Beware my love, beware my love
Beware my love, beware my love
Beware my love, beware my love

Whoa whoa whoa! No no no!
I must be wrong, baby, yeah
But I don't believe that he's the one
But you insist, I must be wrong
I must be wrong!
I have to leave, and when I'm gone
I'll leave my message in my song
(That's right, hey)

Beware my love, well he'll bowl you over
Beware my love, before you're much older
Hey, he'll sweep you up under his carpet
You'd be in luck if you could stop it
Come on now
Beware my love
(Lemme tell her)
Well, he'll wear you out, and in a minute
You'll hear a shout, and then you'll be in it
So, so now beware my love, 'cause he'll take you under
Beware, my love, the sound of his thunder
Yeah!

I don't believe that he's the one
But if you insist, I must be wrong
I must be wrong
But I have to leave, and when I'm gone
I'll leave my message in my song
That's where I'm gonna leave it, baby
Come on

Beware, my love, don't you know he'll bowl you over?
Beware, my love before you're much older
He's gonna, yeah, he's gonna wear you out
When in a minute, you'll hear a shout
And then you'll be in it
Baby gonna be there
Ow, beware
Yeah I'll be there
Oh, baby, beware
Beware, beware, my love
Yeah, any minute, oh
I don't know if I can stand it anymore
'Cause I'm just gonna say to you my love
That you better be there
Can't say, I've found out
I'll tell you to
Beware my love
Beware my love
Beware my love
Beware my love
Beware my love
Beware my loveEmbed
