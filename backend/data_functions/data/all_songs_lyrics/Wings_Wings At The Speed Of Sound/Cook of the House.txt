Cook of the House Lyrics
Ground rice, sugar, vinegar, Seco salt
Macaroni too
Cook of the house
I'm the cook of the house
No matter where I serve my guests
They seem to like the kitchen best
'Cause I'm the cook of the house
Cook of the house

The salad's in the bowl
The rice is on the stove
Green beans in the colander
And where the rest is heaven only knows

Cinnamon, garlic, salt, pepper
Corn-bread, curry powder, coffee too
Cook of the house
I'm the cook of the house
No matter where I serve my guests
They seem to like the kitchen best
'Cause I'm the cook of the house
Cook of the house
And the rest is heaven only knows

Cinnamon, garlic, salt, pepper
Corn-bread, curry powder, coffee too
Cook of the house
I'm the cook of the house (that's the cook of the house)
No matter where I serve my guests
They seem to like the kitchen best
'Cause I'm the cook of the house (that's the cook of the house)
Cook of the house (she's the cook of the house)
Cook of the house (that's the cook of the house)
I'm the cook of the house
Take it fellow1Embed
