Must Do Something About It Lyrics
I've just seen another sunset on my own
All-day long I've been alone
And I must do something about it
Yes I must do something about it

Played another losing card game with myself
Lonely joker on a shelf
And I must do something about it
Yes I must do something about it

No one on the party line
No one seems to need a dime
No one even knows that I'm feeling this way
No one seems to need my vote
No one has to change a note
No one here to hold my coat
Oh, what a day

I've just watched another movie on t.v
No one's in the house but me
And I must do something about it
Yes I must do something about it
Oh, oh, something about it
I've just dialed another number on my phone
All-day long I've been alone
And I must do something about it
Yes, I must do something about it

I've just seen another sunset on my own
All-day long I've been alone
And I must do something about it
Yes I must do something about it
Must do something about it
Yes, I must do something about it4Embed
