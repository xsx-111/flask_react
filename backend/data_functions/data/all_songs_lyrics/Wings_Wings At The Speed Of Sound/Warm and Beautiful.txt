Warm and Beautiful Lyrics
A love so warm and beautiful
Stands when time itself is falling
A love so warm and beautiful
Never fades away

Love, faith, and hope are beautiful
When your world is touched by sadness
To each his own is wonderful
Love will never die

Sunlight's morning glory
Tells the story of our love
Moonlight on the water
Brings me inspiration ever after


Sunlight's morning glory
Tells the story of our love
Moonlight on the water
Brings me inspiration ever after
A love so warm and beautiful
Stands when time itself is calling
A love so warm and beautiful
Never fades away
Never fades awayEmbed
