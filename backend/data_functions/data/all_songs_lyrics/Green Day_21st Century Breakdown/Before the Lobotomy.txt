Before the Lobotomy Lyrics
Dreaming, I was only dreaming
Of another place and time, where my family's from
Singing, I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away all these scattered dreams
Dying, everyone's reminded
Hearts are washed in misery, drenched in gasoline
Laughter, there is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday now live in the underground...

(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Life before the lobotomy
Christian sang the eulogy
Signed, "My love," a lost memory
From the end of the century

Well, it's enough to make you sick
To cast a stone and throw a brick
But when the sky is falling down
You burned your dreams into the ground

Christian's lesson's what he's been sold (Hey!)
We are normal and self-controlled (Hey!)
Remember to learn to forget (Hey!)
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes
Well, I'm not stoned, I'm just fucked up
I got so high I can't stand up
Well, I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessed
I'm not in love, 'cause I'm a mess

Like refugees (Ooh)
We're lost like refugees (Ooh)
Like refugees (Ooh)
We're lost like refugees (Ooh)
The brutality of reality
Is the freedom that keeps me from...

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
Of another place and time, where my family's from
Singing, I can hear them singing
When the rain had washed away all these scattered dreams
Dying, everyone's reminded
Hearts are washed in misery, drenched in gasoline
Laughter, there is no more laughter
Songs of yesterday now live in the underground...15Embed
