Song of the Century Lyrics
Sing us a song of the century
That's louder than bombs and eternity
The era of static and contraband
Leading us into the promised land

Tell us a story that's by candlelight
Waging a war and losing the fight
They're playing a song of the century
Panic and promise and prosperity

Tell me a story into that goodnight
Sing us a song for me...5Embed
