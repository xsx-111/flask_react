East Jesus Nowhere Lyrics
"Reberu rajio!"
"¡La última noche!"
"And we will see how Godless a nation we have become."
(...em sseug dnoceS) ...em tset t'noD

Raise your hands now to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized, well
(Stand up!) All the white boys
(Sit down!) And the black girls
(Stand up!) You're the soldiers
(Sit down!) Of the new world

Put your faith in a miracle
And it's non-denominational
Join the choir, we'll be singing
In the church of wishful thinking

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics
Oh, bless me, Lord, for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in "the river of a shadow of doubt"
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a goddamn thing!

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Don't test me
Second-guess me
Protest me
You will disappear

I want to know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
The missionary politicians
And the cops of the new religion!
A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside

Yeah!20Embed
