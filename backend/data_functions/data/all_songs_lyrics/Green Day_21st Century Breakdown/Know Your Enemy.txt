Know Your Enemy Lyrics
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

Violence is an energy against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy, rah-eh!
Bringing on the fury, the choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
While burning down the foreman of control (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
And silence is an enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
Don't be blinded by the lies in your eyes, say!
Oh-eh-oh-eh!
Oh-eh-oh-eh!

Well, violence is an energy (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, from here to eternity (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, violence is an energy (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
Well, silence is the enemy, so gimme, gimme revolution!

Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!
Do you know the enemy? Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy, rah-eh!

(Do you know the enemy?)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
(Well, gotta know the enemy!)
While burning down the foreman of control (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)
(Do you know the enemy?)
Silence is an enemy, against your urgency
(Well, gotta know the enemy!)
So rally up the demons of your soul! (Oh-eh-oh-eh!)13Embed
