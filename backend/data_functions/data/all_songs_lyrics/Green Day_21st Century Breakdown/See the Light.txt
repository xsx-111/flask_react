See the Light Lyrics

Well I crossed the river, fell into the sea
Where the non-believers go beyond belief
Then I scratched the surface in the mouth of hell
Running out of service in the blood, I fell

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

Well I've been wasted, pills and alcohol
And I've been chasing down the pool halls
Then I drank the water from a hurricane
And I set a fire just to see the flame

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight

Well I crossed the desert, reaching higher ground
Then I pound the pavement to take the liars down
But it's gone forever, but never too late
Where the ever after is in the hands of fate

Well I, I just want to see the light
And I, I don't want to lose my sight
Well I, I just want to see the light
And I need to know what's worth the fight
