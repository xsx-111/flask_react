Horseshoes and Handgrenades Lyrics
One, two, three, four!

I'm not fucking around
I think I'm coming out
All the deceivers and cheaters, I think we've got a bleeder right now
Want you to slap me around
Want you to knock me out
Well, you missed me, kissed me, now you better kick me down

Maybe you're the runner-up, but the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in horseshoes and handgrenades

I'm gonna burn it all down
I'm gonna rip it out
Well, everything you employ was meant for me to destroy to the ground, now
So don't you fuck me around
Because I'll shoot you down
I'm gonna drink, fight, and fuck, and I'm pushing my luck all the time, now

Maybe you're the runner-up, but the first one to lose the race
Almost only really counts in horseshoes and handgrenades
Demolition, self-destruction
Want to annihilate this age-old contradiction!
Demolition, self-destruction
Want to annihilate this age-old contradiction
Demolition, self-destruction
Want to annihilate this old age

I'm not fucking around
I think I'm coming out
Well, I'm a hater, a traitor in a pair of Chuck Taylors right now

I'm not fucking around
G-L-O-R-I-A!
G-L-O-R-I-A!
G-L-O-R-I-A!
G-L-O-R-I-A!8Embed
