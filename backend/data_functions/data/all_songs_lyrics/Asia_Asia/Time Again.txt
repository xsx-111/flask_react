Time Again LyricsFate looks certain but then nothing's guaranteed
Want for nothing, but is nothing what you need?
Always pushing though you're never satisfied
I did believe you 'til I found out that you lied
Time and time again
Time and time again, again
For what I give you I get nothing in return
Can't forgive you watching all your bridges burn
All day long I sat and watched you do it wrong
Have to say that's how you did it all along
Time and time again
Time and time again, again
When others learned it seemed that you could only see
And someone showed you, then why was it always me
You knew the limit you were always out of bounds
How could I trust you when I caught you messing 'round
Time and time again
Time and time again, again2Embed
