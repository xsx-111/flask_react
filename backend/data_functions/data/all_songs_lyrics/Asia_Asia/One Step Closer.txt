One Step Closer LyricsLoneliness, a constant friend and lover
I know well
Crowded rooms the iron bars
That surround me
Trying hard to catch your eye
Just once
Did you see?
Knowing from this moment if you did
We could be
One step closer
Closer than we are
One step closer
Much closer than before
So many lines, you've heard them all
A lie in every one
From men who never understand
Your personality
And though we've never even met
No talking needs to be done
The hum of conversation will dissolve you
Into me
One step closer
Closer than we were
One step closer
Much closer than before
One step closer
Much closer than we were
One step closer
Much closer than before
One step closer
Much closer than we were
One step closer
It's closer than before
One step closer
Much closer than we were
One step closer
It's closer than beforeEmbed
