Cutting It Fine LyricsThe door swings open but you won't go in
You hate the movie that you haven't seen
You couldn't see what I have in mind
I see you laughing but you're
Cutting it, cutting it fine
You never should have done those things to me
There's one thread left 'tween you and history
And while our temperature is rising high
I'm warning you that you are
Cutting it, cutting it fine
Cutting it, cutting it fine...
You gambled all on one important game
Now take the debt and don't complain
Your game was up, I saw it all the time
I saw that vice, girl, you're
Cutting it, cutting it fine
Your sole advisor always was yourself
You never listen to no one else
You were the one who ignored the signs
Dancing on a fine line
Cutting it fine
Cutting it, cutting it fine...Embed
