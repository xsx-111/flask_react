Here Comes the Feeling LyricsAll through the winter I thought I'd never see you again
Oh God where were you when I needed you
I know that you, no, you would never have betrayed me
I thought I'd die, why? All the reasons still evade me
But you're back
Now I can see you
Now I can feel you
Now that I want you
Now I can touch you
Next to me
Here it comes
Here comes the feeling
Here comes that same old feeling
Here comes the feeling
Here comes that same old feeling
This is for real, I never felt so good before
I see the world through different eyes
Now that you're back, nothing in the least can overcome me
Misery gone, plus all the doubt that overran me
But you're back
Now I can see you
Now I can feel you
Now that I want you
Now I can touch you
Next to me
Here it comes
Here comes the feeling
Here comes that same old feeling
Here comes the feeling
Here comes that same old feeling
All through the winter I thought I'd never see you again
Oh God where were you when I needed you
I know that you, no, you would never have betrayed me
I thought I'd die, why? All the reasons still evade me
'Cause you're back
Now I can see you
Now I can feel you
Now that I want you
Now I can touch you
Next to me
Here it comes
Here comes the feeling
Here comes that same old feeling
Here comes the feeling
Here comes that same old feelingEmbed
