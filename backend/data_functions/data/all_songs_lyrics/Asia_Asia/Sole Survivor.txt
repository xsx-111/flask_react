Sole Survivor Lyrics
When I ride the hounds of hell
Twist my foot, I nearly fell
I was lucky I was alive
One look back, I could have died

I was the sole survivor
Sole survivor, sole survivor
Solitary fighter

When I saw it I was amazed
One time glory right in my gaze
I saw the sorrow, I saw the joy
Light in the darkness none could destroy

I am the sole survivor
The sole survivor, sole survivor
Solitary fighter

And from the wreckage I will arise
Cast the ashes back in their eyes
See the fire I will defend
Just keep on burning right to the end
I'll be the sole survivor
