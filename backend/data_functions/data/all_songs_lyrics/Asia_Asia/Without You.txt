Without You LyricsGazing at our sunrise
Reflected in your clear eyes
Misty morning forest smoke fires
Make our way through the broken day
I couldn't stand to stay
Without you
We must keep moving
While the light is clearing
Leaving your dark world behind you
You have to run
Life is just begun
I'll never be alone
Without you
One chilling thought
Come screaming through the dark
I saw a yellow moon at midnight
And now you woke
Glowing in the smoke
I'm suddenly alone
Without you
Wanting things the way they used to be
You don't know what that can do to me
One more day, maybe never
Might as well be forever
Outside the light, fading as I write
And another night reminds me
That as I sleep, memory that I keep
It's just another day
Without you
It seems so long
I've been holding on
Since I felt my arms around you
As time will go, both of us will know
Never be a day
Without youEmbed
