The Other Side LyricsWell there are times
When you will not like the sound of my voice
There are days when a warm look from a strange face
Will make me forget my name
And there are nights
When you wonder where the party's at now
And you wonder why you never split this beat scene
When a higher life awaits
And there are days
When you don't know how you picked the wrong life
In a second when it's over in our own minds
And it's gone without a sound
And there are fights
That'll hear things that we know we don't mean
And we say 'em cause we don't know what we both want
And we can't get to the other side
There are years
That'll fly like winds across a floodplain
Unaware of it's own weight, free of friction
And immune to it's own speed
There are weeks
That'll crawl like slugs across a hot road
Only moving cause it just don't know how to stop
On a search for God knows what
And there are songs
That'll make your skull ring like a dropped cup
Resonating with the reasons why you worked through
And the reasons why you stayed
For the long nights when you found a new resolve that I never knew was there
For the cold eye and the warm embrace now
For the righteous vibe that I need like the air I breathe, yeah
Well there are times
When you'll think you've got my funny number figured out
There'll be days when I don't feel like
I ever knew you all that well
And there are lines
Drawn behind, around, above and over everything
In an effort to figure out
The place and time, the wrong, the right, the yours, the mine
And I'll be damned
If I feel like I will ever know anything
But if don't keep moving on that last hill
We'll never know what's on the other sideEmbed
