Time Bomb LyricsWell I
I am a time bomb, and I
I lay forgotten at the bottom of your heart
I'm fine
Ticking away the hours 'til I blow your world apart
I
I am a poison, and I
I am still coursing through your bloodstream like a ghost
Like wine
Gathering vintage for the day I hurt the most
I
I am a landmine, and I
I lay on the soil burned out by battles you thought you'd won
I've got time
To wait for the footsteps of a memory that's on the run
Well I
I am a tar pit, and I
I swell like a living thing, all at the slightest touch
A black grime, yeah
Swallowing everything, a cold and timeless clutch
I
Well I am a trip wire, and I
I'm stretching across the road you're barreling down tonight
A thin-ish twine
Waiting to be released right beyond your sight
I
Well I am a fault line, and I
I'm pulling apart the ground that lay beneath your newest seed
So fine
Moving in inches now, I'm crawling, I'm cutting, I'm cleaving, like a knife
Well I
I am a time bomb, and I
I only live in that one moment in which you die
It's not right
It's not what I wanted then, but you know and I know there's no going back
I
I am a lost soul, and I
I send out a sickened light for anyone to see
A cry for help
Yeah, a warning to stay away
The burning, the blinding, the reaching in darkness
Why, yeah, yeah1Embed
