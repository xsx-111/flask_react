Come Home LyricsCalled in sick to work today
I couldn't have gotten a damn thing done
Anyhow
Made myself some coffee and I
Listened to the rain rattling leaves
Yeah
I told myself there's nothing wrong and
Stared right through the paper for a
Long, long time
Stuck inside your dream so long
It wears you down and grows you old
And that's a fact
Cold light comes to clear the fog
Away from time to time
But it'll be back soon
I used to think that justice had to
Rule for happy lives, but now I'm not so
Sure at all
Come home
Why don't you come home I could not remember why you left
And I'd rather be happy than right this time
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Called my dad to check in and
To maybe find some common sense
More or less
He says "common sense is such a scam"
And I'm like "Dad
What do you mean?" Oh
He says "you're either wrong or right and
Life will go on either way, whatever you chose"
But I know
That anger's all right
And bitterness no
Cold uncontrollably sad
And unable to let it go
And it should be as easy as telling a scab
From a scar
Well I don't know
Well I don't know
Well I don't know
Well I don't know
Well I don't know
Well I don't know
Called in sick to work today
I couldn't have gotten a damn thing doneEmbed
