Pay for the Piano LyricsPeople, my people
The cat in the steeple
And everyone here, I need your ear
So be cool for a few
I feel a funny emotion
A negative notion
A tear in the air, an unseen stare
If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong
What I say?
Senors and senoras
They cannot ignore us
We know that they know the score, it's there at the core
Always been
And we could give it up all nice
Or put it on cold ice
While that could suffice I give these dreams up in hell
Ring a bell
What I say?
Somebody's got to pay for the piano
Somebody's got to make sure we honor everyone
I know if we can forfeit all our sorrow, it may as well be us
So, people my people
Supreme to my equal
Say not a word I know you're tired
So am I
I could cry
You know you knew it would be hard
To play such a bad card
Lower your guard to unseen harm
'cos you're scarred
I can see
And the people that need you
Say the couldn't read you
You plant 'em a seed they claim they loved all the weeds
So you flee
What I say
Somebody's got to pay for the piano
Somebody's got to make sure we honor everyone
I know if we can forfeit all our sorrow, it may as well be us, it may as well be now, it may as well be us
So, people my people
The cat in the steeple
And everyone here, I know your fear like a friend
I contend
Commandos, commandettes
It wasn't a sure bet
But nothing good was and what should or could be
Does what it can
It's a quiet and sad choice
You hear in your own voice
I know what I'd like and I can't say any more
Je t'adore
So break it down
Somebody's got to pay for the piano
Somebody's got to make sure we honor everyone
I know if we can forfeit all our sorrow, it may as well beEmbed
