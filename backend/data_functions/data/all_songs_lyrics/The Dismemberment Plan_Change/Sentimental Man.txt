Sentimental Man LyricsThere is no heaven and there is no hell
No limbo in between
I think it's all a lie
Just a white light out to velvet black
And back to neutral gray
That's all when we die
There is no fate that divides our day
No spirits hard at work
No unseen hand at play
People talk like it's a given thing
I dunno what they mean
Nor, I suspect, do they
Well, I guess that's ok
But how do you know I'm not a sentimental man?
Is it really so hard to see these things? I guess it is
I couldn't tell you why, I think it's right there
Nobody's perfect, but I'm doing what I can
And you best believe I'll keep it real
I'm an old testament type of guy
I like my coffee black
And my parole denied, yeah
Even as I flake on every deal
I ever made with myself
Before the ink could dry
Well, I should keep that one inside
How do you know I'm not a sentimental man?
Is it really so hard to see these things? I guess it is
I couldn't tell you why, I think it's plain to see
Certain disaster, and I really couldn't say
How the fuck I could let this get so far
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
How do you know that I'm not your biggest fan?
Can you really make that case so clear? I think you can't
I don't know why you try, I guess it's all a game
I'm under the covers and I'm telling you good night
Cause I plan to have some real fine dreamsEmbed
