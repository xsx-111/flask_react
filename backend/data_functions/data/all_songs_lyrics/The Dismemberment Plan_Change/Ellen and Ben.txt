Ellen and Ben LyricsEllen and Ben
They met at someone's housewarming party
They didn't like each other at first
I was still there
I heard them talking as they found their raincoats
They made a date expecting the worst
When Ellen got home
She made a snack and went up on her rooftop
And didn't think about Ben at all
She stayed up for hours
Just watching all the drunk folks find their taxis
'Cause all in all it was a good night
SoCo in bed
A sunny Sunday watching John McLaughlin
And having sex again and again
I had stopped by
'Cause Ellen had my copy of "Nebraska"
They never even put on their clothes
I hung for a while
But every time I tried to ask them something
They started making out all again
I thought it was rude
I couldn't tell you why, yeah yeah
Why
Ellen and Ben
They may as well have run off to Havana
They simply disappeared for a year
They'd show up at shows
But less and less, and saying "Hi" to no one
And why they even came wasn't clear
They got a new place
But neither of their names were in the phonebook
So no one really knew where they where
I thought it was cheap
But I couldn't tell you why, yeah yeah
Why, why, yeah yeah
When I was ten
I had this book of modern fighter planes
With F-15s and MiGs
That and a bowl of Breyer's mint chip was life at its apex
The chewing of pens
The Ocean City girls on the boardwalk
Singing oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Yeah yeah
Ellen and Ben
I heard they broke up loudly at a wedding
And never saw each other again
It seems kinda weird
They made each other feel like they could die
But they couldn't stay the slightest of friends
Well I'm doing fine
I'm staying busy hanging with my nephew
And trying to keep my eyes on the prize
You know how it goes
And so do I, so call me when you can now
You know how I love a surprise
Oh yeah1Embed
