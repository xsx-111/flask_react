The Face of the Earth LyricsAs kisses go
It wasn't anything out of the ordinary
The alkaline lips
Her fingers hooked around my belt
She had to go
She took a step back in and then she started to smile
I heard a funny sound
And everything seemed to shift, yeah
A crazy wail
A funny shutter of a bad magnetic event
A ghost ran through us
Moving like a shadow of a cloud
And I wasn't sure
I thought that something happened but I didn't know what
The moment seemed to fade
And I turned my eyes back to her
That's when I saw
I freeze the look of pre-alert and study it still
Her smile starts to loosen, her pupils yawn wide
And then she's blown
From the face of the earth
There wasn't any wind, no noise, no nothing just a body jerked skyward, limbs flailing like an unloved marionette
At impossible speed
Receding away like a faraway dot
I can see her still, scream for help but no one answered, she turned end on end, moving like a long-lost astronaut
I felt the summer air reclaim me
The chirp of a bird, the whisper of leaves
And I was frozen
To the face of the earth
I never really knew the way she lived her life
I tried a couple numbers but they never called back
I didn't know her family or friends at all
With no one to call, summer turned into fall
I gave up
It's been a couple years and I guess I'm fine about it
It's not like we were married, it was three or four months
And nothing's really different though it seems like I've spent my life in planes
Which is kind of strange
But I don't know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, yeah...Embed
