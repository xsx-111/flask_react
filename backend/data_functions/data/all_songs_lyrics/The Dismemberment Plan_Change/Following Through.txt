Following Through Lyrics
It coulda been good
It coulda been something special
It may have had real potential
It never could show
It coulda been great
It coulda been something alright
But we never did keep it that tight
So whaddya know?
I get up at 5am, I so don't need those dreams
That I used to have

It coulda been swell
It coulda been off the hook now
If we ever had what it took now
I haven't a clue
I think it's as well
We may have been on the right track
Finding all the pieces we lack
But what can you do?
Now I see that these are cards we drew some time ago
So if you don't know

I can do it anywhere with anyone at any time, don't you forget
This is my life and it's going to be good, don't you know?
Not a promise or a threat or an ultimatum, though I can do that too
I'm just telling you
I've got this life, I've just got to live
I'm just following through
I dishonor the past
Being so loose with my time
I could stand accused of high crimes
In the court of the dead
And I could be next
On a page about to turn soon
So I'm movin' my ass at high noon
You heard what I said
I could say I hope I'm not misread, but that's all right
I'm quite OK with losing that fight

I can do it anywhere with anyone at any time, don't you forget
This is my life and it's going to be good, don't you know?
Not a promise or a threat or an ultimatum, though I can do those too
I'm just telling you
I've got this life, I've just got to live
I'm just following throughEmbed
