Give Me the Cure LyricsI never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
You've got your hands over your ears
You've got your mouth running on
You've got your eyes looking for something
That can never be found
Like a reason
Good god, I don't need a reason
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never thought on the dying
I never ever held the hand of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
And you've got to, and you've got to
And you've got to
Gimme the shot
Gimme the pill
Gimme the cure
Now what you've done to my world
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never thought on the dying
I never walked the side of dying before
And now I'm feel like I'm...
And now I'm feel like I'm... (it breaks, it breaks, it breaks, yeah)
Under your skin
Cap over your eyes
I'm at the tip of your finger
(it breaks, it breaks, it breaks, yeah)
Tell me the reason
Gimme the shot
Gimme the pill
Gimme the cure (it breaks, it breaks, it breaks)
Now what you've done to my world
(Coming around, coming around)
(Coming around, coming down)
(Give me the shot)
(Give me the pill)
(Give me the cure)
(Now what you've done to my world)
(Give me the shot)
Now c'mon (give me the pill)
(Give me the cure)
(Now what you've done to my world)
Gimme the shot1Embed
