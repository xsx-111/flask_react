Codeine LyricsIf there's one thing I can't stand
It's this bar and this cover band
Trying to fake their way through "Castles Made of Sand"
That's one thing I can't stand
If there's one thing I can't take
It's the sound that a woman makes
About five seconds after her heart begins to break
That's one thing I can't take
She should be home by now,, but she ain't
And I should've gone by now, but I can't
'Cause one of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine
One of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine
Them eyes was big as stars
When I saw you behind the bar
I guess that's the way to keep on smilin' where you are
But girl, them eyes was big as stars
It sounds funny when you say my name
It's like you're chewing on a foreign thing
And you won't get to sleep till dawn, if it don't rain
It sounds so funny when you say my name
You oughta come home tonight,, but you won't
I wish we knew how to fight, but we don't
One of your friends has taken you in and given you Codeine
One of your friends has taken you in and given you Codeine
Darlin', I'm not one to judge
But if I was, then I'd say you don't look so good
Got no answers of my own
But with you gone, this place looks bigger than it should
If there's two things that I hate
It's having to cook and trying to date
Bust our ass all day to play 'hurry up and wait'
That's a few things that I hate
If I call when I ain't drunk
This old boat will still be sunk
'Cause one of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine
One of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine
One of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine
One of my friends has taken her in and given her codeine1Embed
