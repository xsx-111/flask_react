Never Could Believe LyricsI knew this lady from Tennessee
Moved to California, didn't stay with me
Just packed a bag and left when we passed out
Never could believe a word that come from her mouth
She told me once, drunk on wine
She'd be beside me till the end of time
But the end of time come early at my house
Never could believe a word that came from her mouth
There weren't no truth in a word that lil' girl said
Only time she didn't lie to me was when we was rolling in the big old bed
She worked real hard every day
Old fame and fortune never came her way
It just slid on by like springtime in the south
Never could believe a word that come from her mouth
She came back home on a Trailways bus
Stole a pack of Camels for the both of us
She crawled right up to the front door of my house
Never could believe a word that come from her mouth
There weren't no truth in a word that lil' girl said
Only time she didn't lie to me was rolling in the big old bed
Said, I knew this lady from Tennessee
Moved to California, didn't stay with me
She just packed a bag and left with me passed out
No, I never could believe a word that come from her mouthEmbed
