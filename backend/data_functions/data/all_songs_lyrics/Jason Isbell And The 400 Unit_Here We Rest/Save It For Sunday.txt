Save It For Sunday LyricsShe loves me, she loves me not
I don't bring it up 'cause she's all I've got
I don't ever ask why she's around
I just reach for the stars with my feet on the ground
My feet on the ground
A dog-eared page, a book I've read
So many times it's all there in my head
I watch every word reflect in her eyeglasses
I know when she'll laugh and I know when she'll cry
I know when she'll cry
Save it for Sunday
Save it for the choir and everyone
Save it for Sunday
We got cares of our own
On this side of town, you can't walk alone
A girl like yourself will probably wind up gone
There's talk about work, gonna open a bar
With 85 bouncers and one lonely star
One lonely star
Save it for Sunday
Save it for the choir and everyone
Save it for Sunday
We got cares of our ownEmbed
