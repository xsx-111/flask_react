Go It Alone LyricsAre you lonely tonight?
Are you out on the road?
I'm headed home to go it alone again
Are you dreaming out loud?
Scared of the crowd?
I'm headed home to go it alone again
It's realizing just how close you've come to death
And rearranging accordingly
I'm realizing what I've lost and what I've left
And taking it home to go it alone again
Find me a place with salt on the roads
I'll do what I'm told
And buy what I'm sold again
She was enough
But that was never enough
The wound, it won't heal, pain I can't feel again
In real life, these things don't happen much at all
It's too bad we all live the dream
I'm realizing just how far I had to fall
And taking it home to go it alone again
In real life, these things don't happen much at all
Too bad we all live the dream
I'm realizing just how far I had to fall
And taking it home to go it alone again
I'm taking it home to go it alone again
Taking it home to go it alone againEmbed
