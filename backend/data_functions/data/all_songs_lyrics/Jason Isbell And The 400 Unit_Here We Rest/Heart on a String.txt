Heart on a String LyricsI was out there all alone
I was searching for a friend
You saw my need and you came along
With that charm you took me in
Then one night, you captured my heart
Turned the smoke into a flame
I can't free my heart from you, baby
'Cause you keep it hanging on your string
I can't free my heart from you, baby
'Cause you keep it hanging on your string
That way of loving is my weakness
You made me yours, body and soul
My mind tells me I should leave this
But my heart can't let me go
You tied me down to you and you went away
Turned all of my pleasure into pain
I can't free my heart from you, baby
'Cause you keep it hanging on your string
I can't free my heart from you, baby
'Cause you keep it hanging on your string
Every time I try to break loose
That's when you tie a knot on your string
I can't hold up to what I'm going through
My heart is weakening from the strain
I know, I know if you untied me, baby
I'd be bound to you just the same
I can't free my heart from you, baby
If you keep it hanging on your string
I can't free my heart from you, baby
If you keep it hanging on your string
I can't free my heart from you, baby
If you keep it hanging on your string
I can't free my heart from you, baby
'Cause you keep it hanging on your stringEmbed
