Tour Of Duty LyricsI'm riding on the day's last train
Stepping on the platform trying to see you through the rain
I don't know the ways she's changed since I left
And I really don't care
I've done my tour of duty
Now I'm home and I ain't going anywhere
I taught myself to tolerate the pain
On the loneliness and boredom and the work I did in vain
All the work we did in vain
Now I'm not the same as I was
I've done my tour of duty
Now I'll try to do what a civilian does
I promise not to bore you with my stories
I promise not to scare you with my tears
I never would exaggerate the glory
I'll seem so satisfied here
I been eating like I'm out on bail
Collard greens and chicken wings, oysters by the pail
Eating oysters by the pail
Making up for those lost days
'Cause I've done my tour of duty
And now I'm going to put you in my family way
We'll laugh like little children telling secrets
Probably cry like old women drinking gin
'Cause I've done my tour of duty
Now I'm home and I ain't leaving here again
I've done my tour of duty
Now I'm home and I ain't leaving here againEmbed
