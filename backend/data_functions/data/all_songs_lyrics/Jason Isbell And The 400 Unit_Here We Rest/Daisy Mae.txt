Daisy Mae LyricsLay down beside me
Close your eyes and feel the noonday sun
These eyes, they remind me
Of a scared and simple doe before she runs
John was a Baptist
He feared the world could end at any time
You and I are charged with this
To hold the essence of a kiss
And take these broken plans and make them rhyme
Daisy Mae, Daisy Mae
This hasn't been your day
Hasn't been your day
Here, he never touched you
Inside this house, he never called your name
So stay where I can see you, girl
We both know the outside world has changed
And it will never be the same
My hands, they are wicked
My head and my heart are wicked too
All these things that I do wrong
If you weren't given fear so strong
I would not be good enough for you
Daisy Mae, Daisy Mae
This hasn't been your day
But I won't lay this pistol down
Until the sky falls to the ground
Leave him there to call your name
Till man and land are both the same
Daisy Mae, Daisy Mae
This hasn't been your day
Daisy Mae, Daisy Mae
This hasn't been your day
Hasn't been your dayEmbed
