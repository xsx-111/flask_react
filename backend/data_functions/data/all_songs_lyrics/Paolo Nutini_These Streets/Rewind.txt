Rewind Lyrics
Picking up the pieces of the wreck you went and left
And I'm dealing with dilemmas
In my now so stressful life
And I'm drinking stronger spirits
I made my home here on the floor
And I'm losing all ambition and goals
I'm going all out
I'm thinking you're just as bad

No sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

Oh remember at 16
Oh the crazy drunken night we had
When I kissed you in the hallway
Then I took you straight to bed
Oh two years on
And I'm still that same boy I was

No sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
You might blame it on me
But you insisted that we fall
Wiped your hands of me
And said you needed more, more, more

No sleeping at night
But I'm going from bar to bar
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind
Why can't we just rewind

Wo woah woah woah
Wo woah woah woah
Wo wo woah
Can't we just rewindEmbed
