These Streets Lyrics
This next song is uhm is about when I moved from Paisley to London
It's just a bit of change a big difference between them both, it's called these streets you know

Cross the border, into the big bad world
Where it takes you 'bout an hour just to cross the road
Just to stumble across another poor old soul
From the dreary old lanes to the high-street madness
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think to believe this sadness
That creeps up my spine and haunts me through the night

Life is good and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wondering around with a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glen Field road
And spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually I know, I know

Where'd the days go? When all we did was play
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall
From walking by a high-rise to a landmark square
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I struggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone
Life is good and the sun is shining
Everybody flirts to their ideal place
And the children all smile as a boat shuffled by them
Trying to pretend that they've got some space
These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glen Field road
And spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually I know, I know

Life is good and the girls are gorgeous
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm wondering around with a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change that I've lost somehow

These streets have too many names for me
I'm used to Glen Field road
And spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually I know, I know

Cause you keep telling me so1Embed
