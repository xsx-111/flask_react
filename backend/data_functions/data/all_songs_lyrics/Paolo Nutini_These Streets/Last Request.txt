Last Request Lyrics
Slow down, lie down
Remember it's just you and me
Don't sell out, bow out
Remember how this used to be
I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby let's get closer tonight

Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Oh, I've found, that I'm bound
To wander down that one way road
And I realise all about your lies
But I'm no wiser than the fool I was before
I just want you closer
Is that alright?
Baby let's get closer tonight
Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me

Oh, baby, baby, baby
Tell me how can, how can this be wrong?

Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
Grant my last request
And just let me hold you
Don't shrug your shoulders
Lay down beside me
Sure I can accept that we're going nowhere
But one last time let's go there
Lay down beside me
Yeah, lay down beside me

One last time let's go there
Lay down beside me5Embed
