White Lies LyricsThere's a heart on the line, and it rests with your eyes
Please don't fade and please don't cry, 'cause it's all white lies
Take a chance watch it fall, grab too much and lose it all
Now I've lost my disguise, it was all white lies
Stay here, lie with me here, oh lo-fi, lonely sighs
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide
Would it help if I tried, or has it sailed and passed me by
First love grows then it dies, and its all white lies
Stay here, lie with me here, oh lo-fi, lonely sighs
I will roam lost but never alone, hide with me, hide with me
Now you move with the tide and I've heard you've found peace of mind
And I now know that life's design moves around white lies, white lies, white lies, white liesEmbed
