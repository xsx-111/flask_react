Autumn LyricsAutumn leaves under frozen souls
Hungry hands turning soft and old
My hero cried as we stood out there in the cold
Like these autumn leaves I don't have nothing to hold
Handsome smile, wearing handsome shoes
Too young to say though I swear he knew
And I hear him singing while he sits there in his chair
While these autumn leaves float around everywhere
I look at you and I see me, making noise so restlessly
But now it's quiet and I can hear you saying
'My little fish dont cry, my little fish dont cry.'
Autumn leaves have faded now
That smile I lost well I've found some how
'Cause you still live on in my father's eyes
These autumn leaves, oh these autumn leaves
Oh these autumn leaves are yours tonight1Embed
