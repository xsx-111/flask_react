Could It Be Any Harder LyricsFade Away, Fade Away, Fade Away
Fade Away, Fade Away, Fade Away
Uhhh ... (2x)
You left me with goodbye and open arms
A cut so deep I don't deserve (Well)
You were always invincible in my eyes (Yeah)
The only thing against us now is time

Could it be any harder, to say goodbye and without you
Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true
If I only had one more day
(Fade away, Fade away, Fade away
Uhhh ...)
I lie down and blind myself with laughter (Well)
A quick fix of hope is what I'm needing (Whoaa)
And now I wish that I could turn back the hours (Uhhh)
But I know I just don't have the power (Yeah)

Could it be any harder, to say goodbye and without you
Could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true
If I only had one more day
I'd jump at the chance
We'd drink and we'd dance
And I'd listen close to your every word
As if it's your last but I know it's your last
Cause today, oh, you're gone

Could it be any harder (Fade away, fade away, fade away Uhhh)
Could it be any harder
(Fade away, fade away, fade away)
(Whoaaa yeah, yeah)
Could it be any harder, to live my life without you
Could it be any harder
I'm all alone, I'm all alone
Like sand on my feet
The smell of sweet perfume
You stick to me for-e-yeah, yeah-ever, baby
And I wish you didn't go
I wish you didn't go
I wish you didn't go, whoa, whoa away
To touch you again
With life in your hands
It couldn't be any harder, harder
(Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away)
Whoa, whoaaa ...Embed
