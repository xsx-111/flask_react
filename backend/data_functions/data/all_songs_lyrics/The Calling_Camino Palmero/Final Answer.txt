Final Answer LyricsI want love
To carry me through
All of the moments, I'd kindly undo
Locked away
So I can feel safe
Now that I'm down on my knees, begging for change
Look down at the water
Before I jump in
To find I was sinking fast, in all the might have been

What I need now is an honest answer, to make things better
You can see now my hands are tied, and I surrender
So I'll wait here for your final answer, your final answer
Is there love without hate
Is there pleasure without pain?
I have seen all my mistakes
I cast you out, but now, I want you back
So light me again, cause my heart is turning black

What I need now is an honest answer, to make things better
You can see now my hands are tied, and I surrender
So I'll wait here for your final answer, your final answer
Remember the night you wore that dress
It flowed through out lips
Drink after drink, and kiss after kiss
I'm still holding on, day after day
Don't run away
I want love to carry me through
Can you tell me what I'm supposed to do

What I need now is an honest answer, to make things better
You can see now my hands are tied, and I surrender
So I'll wait here for your final answer, your final answerEmbed
