Lucid LyricsDifferent from the rest
Don't you see it?
Somewhere in between
Lucid, lucid
Different from the rest
Don't you see it?
Somewhere in between
Lucid, lucid
Lucid, lucid (don't you see it?)
Lucid, lucid (don't you see it?)
Lucid, lucid (don't you see it?)
Lucid, lucid (don't you see it?)
Different from the rest
Don't you see it?
Where we ought to be
Lucid, lucid
Different from the rest
Don't you see it?
Where we ought to be
Lucid, lucid
Lucid, lucid (don't you see it?)
Lucid, lucid (don't you see it?)
Lucid, lucid (don't you see it?)
Lucid, lucid (don't you see it?)
Lucid, lucid
Lucid
