Spaces Lyrics
An island, yeah, of light
Is it in my mind
An island, yeah, of light
While I wait of time
Spaces between
Where we wanna be
Spaces between
Where we want to be
To be

See you in the light
This time, this time
Sad out o' sight
For next time, next time
See it in the light
This time, this time
Sought out o' sight
For next time, next time

Take another plane
But its unseen
Leavin' behind
The last time
See it in the light
You sat out (doo, doo) the sight
See it in the light
Sat out o' the sightEmbed
