S.O LyricsHe gave it time
No longer pretty sign
Meet in the flame minds
Move in front
Didn't know it could be so
Didn't know it could be so
Didn't know it could be so
Gave her, gave her time
Gave her, gave her time
Didn't know it could be so
Didn't know it could be so
Didn't know it could be so
Didn't know it could be
Didn't know it could be
Didn't know it could be
Didn't know it could be so
Didn't know it could be so
Didn't know it could be soEmbed
