Keep Walking Lyrics
City through the window
Make it our own
Run to it
Plastic cherry blossom
Eyes never close
Run to it
Run to it

Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking

City through the window
Make it our own
Run to it
Plastic cherry blossom
Eyes never close
Run to it
Run to it
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking

Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
Keep walking
