I Never Will Marry Lyrics
They say that love's a gentle thing
But it's only brought me pain
For the only man I ever loved
Has gone on the mornin' train

I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life

Well, the train pulled out, the whistle blew
With a long and a lonesome moan
He's gone, he's gone like the mornin' dew
And left me all alone

I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my life

Well, there's many a change in the winter wind
And a change in the cloud's design
There's many a change in a young man's heart
But never a change in mine
I never will marry
I'll be no man's wife
I expect to live single
All the days of my lifeEmbed
