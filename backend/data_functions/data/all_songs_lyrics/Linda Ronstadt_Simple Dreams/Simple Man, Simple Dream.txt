Simple Man, Simple Dream LyricsWhat if I fall in love with you
Just like normal people do
Well maybe I'd kill you
Or maybe I'd be true
When I go down to get a job sometime
It seems people can read my mind
And make money disappear
While they're talking sweet and kind
Well in some ways I am like a child
You never seemed to know it
And if a kind word ever crossed your mind
You never tried to show it
Well in some ways I am like a child
You never seemed to know it
And if a kind word ever crossed your mind
You never tried to show it
When people don't know what you mean
They may laugh at you and call you green
They'll say your words are stupid
And your plans are only schemes
Truth is simple
But seldom ever seen
Let nothing come between
