A Still Life Franchise LyricsI remember that I kind of laughed at the sparks that spread the flames
Over all the ugly memories these past three years have made
Then I waited for the smoke to fill my lungs and suffocate my pain away
So I say goodbye and I just say so long
Almost feeling paralyzed
My still life with vital signs
And I'll just say so long
My good intentions felt so wrong
Left me feeling so far gone
Well I'm gone, woah, woah
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I remember when I found the place for the ends to list that normal scene
Living in this haunted house on this otherwise normal street
Postcards and photographs of who we were start to burn and fade away
So I say goodbye and I just say so long
Almost feeling paralyzed
My still life with vital signs
And I'll just say so long
My good intentions felt so wrong
Left me feeling so far gone
My good intentions felt so wrong
Left me feeling so far gone
Well I'm gone, woah, woah
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
So I say goodbye and I just say so long
Almost feeling paralyzed
My still life with vital signs
And I'll just say so long
My good intentions felt so wrong
Left me feeling so far gone
And I'll just say so long
My good intentions felt so wrong
Left me feeling so far gone
And I'll just say so longEmbed
