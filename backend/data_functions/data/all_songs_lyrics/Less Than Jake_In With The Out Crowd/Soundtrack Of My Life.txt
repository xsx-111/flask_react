Soundtrack Of My Life LyricsI'm on a mission
To see what's been missing
My favorite song is on repeat
But it's just not helping me
My eyes have been wider
But never been brighter
Something else is going on
I need a reminder of why I feel this way
There's a fine line between
Living a lie and feeling alive
There are times that I've been
Looking from the outside in
And here I go again
Falling behind losing my mind
I'm pretending it's alright
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
Wo-oh
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
I still believe in
Facing all my demons
And everything that people promise
Everything I've always wanted
My mouth has been open
My words have been stolen
It may have been used against me
It's starting to affect me
And now I feel this way
There's a fine line between
Living a lie and feeling alive
There are times that I've been
Looking from the outside in
And here I go again
Falling behind losing my mind
I'm pretending it's alright
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
Wo-oh
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
And it goes like this...
And it takes me back...
And it spins around
And round and round
And round and round
And it goes around
And always leads to black
There's a fine line between
Living a lie and feeling alive
There are times that I've been
Looking from the outside in
And here I go again
Falling behind losing my mind
I'm pretending it's alright
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
Wo-oh
Listening to the soundtrack of my life
