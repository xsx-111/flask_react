In-Dependence Day Lyrics
Rescue me from boring times
It's a story I know line by line
Different deep on the inside
Isn't different if you have to try

I'm borderline
Day after day
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Time passes by
Like a slow parade
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Knocked to my knees again

The measurements of my success
Are always measured in not making sense
My motivation's taking bets
It's apologies or arguments
With a head full of cans and can'ts
(Head full of cans and can'ts)

I try and try and try to remember
Why I think it's now or it's never
I'm borderline
Day after day
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Time passes by
Like a slow parade
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Knocked to my knees again
Knocked off my feet again

I try and try and try to remember
Why I think it's now or it's never

I'm borderline
Day after day
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Time passes by
Like a slow parade
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
I'm borderline
Day after day
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Time passes by
Like a slow parade
Waiting to get
Knocked off my feet again
Knocked to my knees again
Knocked to my knees againEmbed
