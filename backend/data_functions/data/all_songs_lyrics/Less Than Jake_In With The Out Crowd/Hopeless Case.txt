Hopeless Case LyricsI have this feeling inside
That I wouldn't like me if I met me
It seems like a losing fight
If you could see it through my eyes, then you'd believe me
The truth is that I'm overrated
I can't think straight, I'm formulaic
The truth is that it's sad to say it
But you can't help me
You, you don't see me that way, you hear the words that I say
You just tell me my heart's in the right place
It's the world that's confused
And it's never too late to save a hopeless case
I've always known a ghost like me
Can disappear in a moment
Well, I'm my own worst casualty
Anything I touch can be broken
The truth is that I'm self-destructive
I'm insecure, I'm out of focus
The truth is that I've had enough
But you still help me
You, you don't see me that way
You hear the words that I say
You just tell me my heart's in the right place
(You hear the words that I say)
It's the world that's confused
(You hear the words that I say)
And it's never too late to save a hopeless case
You're giving me perspective
Whoa, it's better than mine
Whoa, and I'll still be defective
And you're wasting your time
The truth is that I'm self-destructive
I'm insecure, I'm out of focus
The truth is that I've had enough
But you still help me
You, you don't see me that way
You hear the words that I say
You just tell me my heart's in the right place
(You hear the words that I say)
It's the world that's confused
(You hear the words that I say)
And it's never too late to save a hopeless case
(You hear the words that I say)
And my head is on straight
(You hear the words that I say)
And it's never too late to save a hopeless caseEmbed
