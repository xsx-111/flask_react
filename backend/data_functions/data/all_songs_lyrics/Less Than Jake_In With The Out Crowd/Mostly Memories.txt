Mostly Memories LyricsI can't seem to recognize
Either side of this modern version
Or fading person I was
I try to memorize
Dates and times of old accidents
And the failed attempts now I'm...
I'm still afraid of those mistakes I've made
I'm mostly memories, most missed opportunities
Mostly minor tragedies, I'm mostly you and me
I'm mostly memories, most missed opportunities
Mostly abnormalities, I'm mostly you and me, you and me, you and
Me
I can't seem to recognize
Either side of my conversations
Or contemplations I've done
Yeah, I try to memorize
Truth and lies of the facts and fictions
And half truth admissions I've done
I'm still afraid of those mistakes I've made
I'm mostly memories, most missed opportunities
Mostly minor tragedies, I'm mostly you and me
I'm mostly memories, most missed opportunities
Mostly abnormalities, I'm mostly you and me, you and me, you and
Me
Out of luck and had enough
Out of trust and out of touch
Out of time I'm hanging up
I'm mostly memories, most missed opportunities
Mostly minor tragedies, I'm mostly you and me
I'm mostly memories, most missed opportunities
Mostly abnormalities, I'm mostly you and me, you and me, you and
MeEmbed
