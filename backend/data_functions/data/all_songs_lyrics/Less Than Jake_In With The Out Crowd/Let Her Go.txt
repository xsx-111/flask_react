Let Her Go LyricsGoing back and forth inside my shut up brain again
(You gotta let her go, gotta let her go)
Worlds apart, I'm torn apart, I'll stall up my senses
(You gotta let her go, gotta let her go)
Somehow through it all we've become defenseless
(You gotta let her go, gotta let her go)
I'm living this lie and I can't pretend
(You gotta let her go, gotta let her go)
And I know I'll get that feeling when we meet again
And I know I will be stronger in the end
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
'Cause I don't wanna say goodbye 
Now we realize the compromises you and I
(You gotta let her go, gotta let her go)
You fell from heaven to heartbreak in the blink of an eye
(You gotta let her go, gotta let her go)
And I know I'll get that feeling when we meet again
And I know I will be stronger in the end
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
'Cause I don't wanna say goodbye 
You gotta let her go, gotta let her go 
When I leave right now, get up and walk away
Our yesterdays will begin to fade
You gotta let her go, gotta let her go 
Nana, nana 
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
'Cause I don't wanna say goodbye 
You gotta let her go, gotta let her go 
When I leave right now, get up and walk away
Our yesterdays will begin to fade
You gotta let her go, gotta let her go 
Nana, nana Embed
