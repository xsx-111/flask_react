Landmines And Landslides LyricsDear, you won't answer me, did you honestly think I'd ever leave?
If you'd somehow just believe me
You've gotta know right now that these words still sting
I've lost everything, I've ever touched
The results were eating me up
For once I've had enough
Landmines, landslides no matter how I try
Landmines, landslides every single time
I fell asleep while watching TV
While the living dead they walk my streets this evening
This sitting target's been stuck on the couch again
Pretending I'm stable when the panic sets in
The results were eating me up
For once I've had enough
Landmines, landslides, no matter how I try
You're destined for disaster, you're failure by design
Landmines, landslides, every single time
I'm destined for disaster, I'm trapped on every side
You know how hard I try sometimes, you can see it in my eyes
It's always eating me alive the day to day of getting by
Self-control from all the helplessness I've known
I'm a wreck, whoa, lacking confidence there's no arguments you know
Landmines, landslides, no matter how I try
You're destined for disaster, you're failure by design
Landmines, landslides every single time
I'm destined for disaster, I'm trapped on every side
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Landmines, landslides every single time
I'm destined for disaster, I'm trapped on every sideEmbed
