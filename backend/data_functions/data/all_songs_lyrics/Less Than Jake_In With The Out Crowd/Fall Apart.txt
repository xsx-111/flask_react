Fall Apart LyricsFrustration that I've been facing
I don't remember how but I've lost motivation
I can't stop this sinking feeling from creeping over me
I can't stop myself seeing the darkness in front of me
It's not that hard to just fall apart, fall apart
It's not that hard to just fall apart, I'm falling apart
It's not that hard to just fall apart, from the start
It's not that hard to just fall apart, I'm falling apart
Repeating, I keep retreating
I don't remember how, but I lost all my meaning
Can't stop mistakes I'm making from hanging over me
Can't stop myself from facing the darkness in front of me
It's not that hard to just fall apart, fall apart
It's not that hard to just fall apart, I'm falling apart
It's not that hard to just fall apart, from the start
It's not that hard to just fall apart, I'm falling apart
I remember when I'm reaching my breaking point
Pressure pushing on me till I lost my voice
I don't think I ever had a choice
With this every day decay and destroy
It's not that hard to just fall apart, fall apart
It's not that hard to just fall apart, I'm falling apart
It's not that hard to just fall apart, from the start
It's not that hard to just fall apart, I'm falling apartEmbed
