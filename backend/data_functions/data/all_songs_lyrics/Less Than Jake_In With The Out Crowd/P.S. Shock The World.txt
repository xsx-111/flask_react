P.S. Shock The World Lyrics
It's never been so crystal clear
That I've been dying six months a year
And arguing with strangers about why I'm still here, whoa-oh
And no one lets me forget
Questions about my relevance
And I'm starting to believe
Their arguments, in my self-defense

It's just my self-destructiveness
And always wasting all my breath
And it's still a mystery, why I'm doubting all my dreams

All the things that I say
Will someday fade away
But the message in these songs
Have kept me sane all along
All the things that I say
Will someday fade away
But the message in these songs
Have kept me sane all along
Sane all along

The years hit  like fist to face
And some days I've tried to replace
This person with the same god-given name, whoa-oh
Some days I shake till noon
I've tried to explain to overcrowded rooms
Across these states my narrow point of view
But what can I do
It's just my self-destructiveness
And always wasting all my breath
And it's still a mystery, why I'm doubting all my dreams

All the things that I say
Will someday fade away
But the message in these songs
Have kept me sane all along
All the things that I say
Will someday fade away
But the message in these songs
Have kept me sane all along

It's just my self-destructiveness
And always wasting all my breath
And it's still a mystery, why I'm doubting all my dreams

All the things that I say
Will someday fade away
But the message in these songs
Have kept me sane all along
All the things that I say
Will someday fade away
But the message in these songs
Have kept me sane all along
Sane all along
Sane all along, sane all along
Sane all along, sane all along
Sane all along, sane all along
Sane all along, sane all along
Sane all along, sane all along
Sane all along, sane all along
Sane all along, sane all along
Sane all along, sane all along
Sane all along, sane all alongEmbed
