Blackjack Lyrics
Always keep my-
Always keep my-
Always keep my-
Always keep my-

How I ride, why I ride, never really had to try
I, I, I, euh
Never mind that (Blackjack)
Needle to the mainline junk prepared in a head that
Never came up for air
Fallin' apart, can't get a grip
Dont give a fuck if I did
Way shit goes
It'll be just fine
Oh, oh, oh
How to rob men blind

(Can't do a thing but fold), yeah, watch that
(Can't do a thing but fold), yeah, watch that
(Can't do a thing but fold), yeah, watch that
Can't do a thing
Black, black
Black, black
Black, black
Black, black
Blackjack
Comin' from that hit me until
Twenty one makes
Your chips mine
Black jack don't trip
You got the bill
Twenty one shots to your grill
Bow down or die everytime
I slap them things
Flat black chains rattlin'
Shawshank the box
Can't be contained
Man came to pick the lock
Empty the vault
And leave no trace
Sleep don't wake
Hit 'em low and keep rollin' to the beat no breaks
Slow it down then accelerate
To hell it's cake
Like sellin' weight
No middle man
Made bitch mistakes
(Blackjack)
High king, ace, to knees the place
Put down by G's raisin' the stakes
You know what's up
Straight
How the fuck is that?
(Blackjack)
You know what's up
Straight

But don't forget to watch this
Tongue push bankroll off my lips
Who the hell are you legit?
What the fuck you think, man? Shit
(Blackjack)
Always keep my, blackjack
Always keep my

No need to count the deck
I own it
Drop that
Lead chin check
To your dome it's on black
Respect me zone or get caught back-handed
Leather strap hit you so hard knocked flat
Broke by a bloke with that golden contact
Glove hold the smoke
Of most high fire bon tap tap
Can't do a thing but fold, yeah, watch that
(Can't do a thing but fold), yeah, watch that
(Can't do a thing but fold), yeah, watch that
(Can't do a thing but fold), yeah, watch that
Can't do a thing
Black, black
Black, black
Black, black
Black, black

But don't forget to watch this
Tongue push bankroll off my lips
Who the hell are you legit?
What the fuck you think, man? Shit

You know what's up
Straight
How the fuck is that?
(Blackjack)
Blackjack, don't trip you got the bill
Twenty one shots to your grill (Blackjack)

Always keep my-
Always keep my-
Always keep my-
Always keep my-22Embed
