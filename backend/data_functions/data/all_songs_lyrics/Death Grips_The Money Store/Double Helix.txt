Double Helix Lyrics
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna how I freak it
Double, double
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna how I freak it
Double

Bangin' bones on Roland
Jungle rottin'
Chicken skeletal system bombin'
Unidentified genre abductor
Hit it from the back
Formula fucker
Hooded executor of
Cookie cutter
Can't wait to pull that trigger, shut gunner
(Double, double, so you really wanna know)
Cock the hammer
Droppin' thunder
Double helix stopper
Under influence of that
Head knock, what a
Oh fuckin' G, what a
Oh fuckin' G, fuck it up
Bitch, you don't know me
Run it, blood, ride reel to reel low key
How's it feel, feel, feel, easy
Make it bloody, make it bloody
Ain't really nothin' else
I see any more
Gone in the cause
I'm bleeding for
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know I freak it
Double, double helix

Live in a trance, can't see you
Don't want to anyway, anywhere
What'd you say? Forgot you were even there
Head float astray
Clear the air
Be back when you think I'm gone
Blue jay way, don't belong
Double helix phoenix
From beyond
(Double, so you really wanna know how I freak it)
Rorschach ink blot
In the street
Skid row mark
Show me the beast
I'm the lust, you can't hide
That balled up, fist gut inside
Strapped to, suicide
Missions set off
With so much pride
You can see it
In a dead man's eyes
(So you really wanna know)
No maps with directions
No answers, just questions
Second guessing everything you swore was so, can't
Tell you what to do
But I'll tell you why I threw
All the rules out the window
And took an oath to be true
With the one and only view
A man can ever truly know, know, know, know
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna how
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know I freak it
Double, double helix

Been there and back
'Nough tracks I am
The rail to the road
We run like scam

Drop it on the one
And it's on like damn
Well I never thought
Uh huh, oh yeah
Like I didn't know
Wake up, young blood
Ain't nobody sleepin'
And they never was
Off the cliff in a blur of black blood and hoodoo hexin' guts
I thought you heard them ghetto birds hollering every time I bust
Swallow it down and lap it up, can't do that (Double), I'm-a have to cut
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know
Double, double, double
So you really wanna know I freak it
Double
So you really wanna know how I freak it
Double, double helix15Embed
