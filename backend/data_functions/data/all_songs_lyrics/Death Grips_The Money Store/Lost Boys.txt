Lost Boys Lyrics
Lost boy, lost boy
Lost boy, lost boy
Lost boy, lost boy
Lost boy, lost boy
Lost boy, lost boy
Lost boy, lost boy

Other side of the tracks, scuzz outsiders
Nothin' to lose, strike of midnighters
Lost paradise
True black and blues, no shoes, flat tires
Broke out the pen, blood on barbed wire
Safe in your home, gated zone terrorizers
Nowhere to go
Far as I can get hitchhikers

Lost boy, lost boy
Lost boy, lost boy
Lost boy, lost boy

Fuck a job, might have to rob
And don't know just to get by, word
On the road for lifers
Bullets in the fire (Bullets in the fire)
Check the chain link
Swayze, I'm slummin'
Let 'em know who the fuck we are
Low and dirty lost boys
Comin' out the cuts
Like your favorite scar (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Crawlin 'on tile, can't stand up
Been a while, kommodo gut
How to take it
How to give a fuck
How to live with pain
How to get your cut
How long's this been goin' on?
Man shit no way to tell too far gone, go get those flames from hell bring em here
Don't trip, no (No)
I'll handle this
On some scandalous
Inland empire, Los Angeles
Anti-ego propaganda shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who's comin' up? Who's losin' ground?
2012 (Fuck), I'm shady now, running game on every thing in town
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys

Lost boy, lost boy
Lost boy, lost boy
It's such a long way down

Brown paper baggin', asphalt scrapin', all talk no action, what I'm waitin'
Weak tongue waggin'
Stray dog beggin'
Like don't hurt me
Yeah right, I'm sayin'
Beware you have been warned, the barrels still warm, ease up off that lip or step
How quick a bitch fit to get checked, mate
One false move'll get ya
Set straight
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's such a long way down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
It's such a long way down
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Lost boys, lost boys
Oh, yeah, yeah, why
Ride through the sky of black mist
Ride through the sky of black mist
Ride through the sky of black mist
Ride through the sky of black mist
