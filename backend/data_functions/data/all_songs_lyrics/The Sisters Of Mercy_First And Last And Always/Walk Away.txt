Walk Away Lyrics
And in the summer when the cloud shows through
I might go the same way, too, if
You and I could talk together
Well, what am I supposed to do with
You and I would walk together
Then with always close around and
Now you gaze toward the doorway
When the weather comes falling down

And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay?
Would you choose to walk?
Would you choose to stay?
Would you walk, walk, walk, walk, walk away?
(Away, away) Away, away, (away) away
Away, away, walk away
Would you choose to walk away?
And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay?
Would you choose to walk?
Would you choose to stay?
Would you
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk away
Though when the day is nearly through
I might see the same way, too, if
You would name the things that bring you
Down on me so I could say it's
Not quite true if you don't really
Know or understand the circumstance
Behind then, I might clear your
Mind and you won't have to go, so...
