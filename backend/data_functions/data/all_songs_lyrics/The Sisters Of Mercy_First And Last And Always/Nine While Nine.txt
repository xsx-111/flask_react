Nine While Nine LyricsAnd it's passing strange
And I'm waiting for the train
Caught up on this line again
And it's passing slowly
Killing time
But it's better than living in what will come
And I've still got some of your letters with me
And I Thought sometimes
Or I read too much
And I think you know
Let's drink to the dead lying under the water
And the cost of the blood on the driven snow
And the lipstick on my cigarettes
Frost upon the window pane
Nine while nine and I'm waiting
For the train.....
She said do you remember a time when angels
Do you remember a time when fear
In the days when I was stronger
In the days when you were here
She said when days had no beginning
While days had no end
When shadows grew no longer
I knew no other friend but you
Were wild
You were wild.....
Frost upon these cigarettes
Lipstick on the window pane
And I've lost all sense of the world outside
But I can't forget so I call your name
And I'm looking for a life for me
And I'm looking for a life for you
And I'm talking to myself again
And it's so damn cold it's just not true
And I'm walking
Through the rain
Trying to hold on
Waiting for the train
And I'm only looking
For what you want
But it's lonely here
And I think you knew
And I'm...
And I'm waiting
And I wait in vain
Nine while nine and I'm waiting
For the train..... (repeat last verse x2)5Embed
