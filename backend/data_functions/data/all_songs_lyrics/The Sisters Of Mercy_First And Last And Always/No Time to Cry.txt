No Time to Cry Lyrics
It's just a feeling
I get sometimes
A feeling
Sometimes
And I get frightened
Just like you
I get frightened, too
But it's...

(No, no, no) No time for heartache
(No, no, no) No time to run and hide
(No, no, no) No time for breaking down
(No, no, no) No time to cry

Sometimes in the world as is, you've
Got to shake the hand that feeds you
It's just like Adam says, it's
Not so hard to understand, it's
Just like always, coming down on
Just like Jesus never came and
What did you expect to find? It's
Just like always here again, it's...
(No, no, no) No time for heartache
(No, no, no) No time to run and hide
(No, no, no) No time for breaking down
(No, no, no) No time to cry

Everything will be all right
Everything will turn out fine
Some nights, I still can't sleep
And the voices pass with time
And I keep
Everything will be all right
Everything will turn out fine
Some nights, I still can't sleep
And the voices pass with time
And I keep
No time for tears
No time to run and hide
No time to be afraid of fear and I
Keep no time to cry, it's

(No, no, no) No time for heartache
(No, no, no) No time to run and hide
(No, no, no) No time for breaking down
(No, no, no) No time to cryEmbed
