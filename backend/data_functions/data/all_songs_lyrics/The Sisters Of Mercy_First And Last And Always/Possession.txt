Possession LyricsCarrion child, prey for me
Play your wild card
See the house come down around your head
Home to me, so much dreaming
Some say I'm growing cold and
Taking over
Nothing, cuts, two ways
Possession
Taking over
Stand these pictures on your shelf
And wear your heart upon my sleeve
Wear a dress that you can see through
See yourself inside
I'll be your imagination
Tear apart what you believe
Make a mess of your conviction
Take away my pride and leave
Nothing, but the debris
Cuts, two ways
Carrion child, prey for me
Play your wild card
See the house come down around your
Possession
Taking over
Possession
Shake shake shake shake shake shake
Possession
Taking over
Somehow the fact takes over
And the fiction coming through
Somehow I do my crying
Breaking down for you
This way the doubts takes over
Contradiction coming through
This way I do my lying
Making up and making out for you
Possession
Taking over child
(Nothing)
Prey for me
(But the debris)
Play your wild card
(Cuts two ways)
Some say I'm growing cold and
Taking over
Down around your head
(Nothing)
Home to me
(But the debris)
So much dreaming
See the house come down around your
Possession
Shake shake shake shake shake shake
Possession
Taking over
Possession
Shake shake shake shake shake shake
Possession
Taking holdEmbed
