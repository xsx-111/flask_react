Blood Money LyricsFlesh)
(Bone)
(Splinters on the telephone)
(Whispers)
Bullet in the head
Down
Head
Down
Got power to burn
Got means
Got flowers to burn
Between those pretty dreams
Hold out for cover
Hold out your hands on me
For...
Blood, blood money
Blood, blood money, money, money, money
(Kiss...)
Children.....kiss the ring
Children.....kiss the blade
Blood, blood money
Blood, blood money, money, money, money
Which hand holds your hand?
Holds?
Blood, blood money
Blood, blood money, money, money, moneyEmbed
