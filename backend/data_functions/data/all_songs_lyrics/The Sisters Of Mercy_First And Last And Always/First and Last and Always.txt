First and Last and Always LyricsSee a body and the dream of the dead days
Following lost and blind
Living, far from here
Tomorrow is hard to find
And it seems like twenty-five years of
Promises and give me more
Scenes of a hand me down in
Dresses heard before
First and last and always: 'til the end of time
First and last and always: Mine
Maybe it's not so easy
Maybe it's a way too long
Say, say you'll be by me
When the evidence comes along
First and last and always: My calling, my time
First and last and always: Mine
(My calling)
(My time)
See a body and the dream of the dead days
A following lost and blind
Cross my heart with silver
Here's the key behind
Seems like twenty-five years of
Ever after, ever more more more
Seems I wore this face for you
Far too long before
First and last and always: My calling, my time
First and last and always: Mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of the end of time
First and last and always: Mine
First and last and always: 'til the end of time
First and last and always: MineEmbed
