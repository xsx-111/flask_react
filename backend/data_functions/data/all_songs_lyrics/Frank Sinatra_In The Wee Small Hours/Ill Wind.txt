Ill Wind Lyrics
Blow, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good, no good
Go, ill wind, go away
Skies are, oh, so gray
Around my neighborhood and that ain't good

You're only misleading
The sunshine I'm needing
And ain't that a shame?
It's so hard to keep up
With troubles that creep up
From out of nowhere when love's to blame

So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good
So, ill wind, blow away
Please let me rest today
You're blowing me no good

So, ill wind, blow away
Let me rest today
You're blowing me no good
No good, no goodEmbed
