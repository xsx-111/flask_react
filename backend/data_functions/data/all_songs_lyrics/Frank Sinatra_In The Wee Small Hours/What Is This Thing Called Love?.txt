What Is This Thing Called Love? Lyrics
What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?

I saw you there one wonderful day
But you took my heart and you threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lord up in Heaven above
Just what is this thing called love?Embed
