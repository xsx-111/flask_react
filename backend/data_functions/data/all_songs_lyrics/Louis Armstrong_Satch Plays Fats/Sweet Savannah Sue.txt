Sweet Savannah Sue LyricsOh, sweet Savannah Sue
Around my heart you cling
Sweet Savannah Sue
Well, it's a-ding-a-linging
Got you all day through
I'll sing it
If you don't know how much I think of you
Stars are shinin' bright
Or blinkin'
Moon is full tonight
Or winkin'
Lover's lane is right
My honey, oh, you know what I'm thinking
I'll walk with you
Which should be hunky-dory
And a kiss would be, be a trip to glory
So that's nothin' new
I'm telling you
You know it's true
Oh, honey
Never in old Savannah ever was there a grander time
I'm a-mean to say, I love you
