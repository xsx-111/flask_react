(What Did I Do To Be So)Black And Blue LyricsOld empty bed, springs hard as lead
Feel like old Ned, wish I was dead
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Even the mouse ran from my house
They laugh at you and scorn you too
What did I do to be so black and blue?
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
'Cause I can't hide what is in my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?1Embed
