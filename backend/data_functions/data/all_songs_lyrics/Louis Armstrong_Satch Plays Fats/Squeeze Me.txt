Squeeze Me LyricsDaddy you been doggone sweet on me
Daddy you're the only one I see
You know I need but you, 'cause you're my man
You like me like no one can
Something about you I can't resist
When you kiss me daddy I stay kissed
Oh daddy, squeeze me and squeeze me again
Oh papa don't stop 'til I tell you when
Now daddy, squeeze me and kiss me some more
Just like you did before
Aw
Just pick me up on your knee
I just get so you know, oh when you squeeze meEmbed
