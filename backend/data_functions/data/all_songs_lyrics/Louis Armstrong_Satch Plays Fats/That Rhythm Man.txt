That Rhythm Man LyricsNow the tress all sway to rhythm
And the children play to rhythm
All the birdies flap their wings in rhythm too
Oh, the breezes float to rhythm
And the rivers flow to rhythm
Ev'ry flower nods in rhythm all day through
Now the trees all sway to rhythm
And the children play to rhythm
All the birdies flap their wings in rhythm too
Oh, the breezes float to rhythm
And the rivers flow to rhythm
Ev'ry flower nods in rhythm all day through
Ev'ry dance and ev'ry melody
Acts according to this recipe
Ev'rybody walks to rhythm
Ev'rybody talks to rhythm
Seems like the world can do without that rhythm man
