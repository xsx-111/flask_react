All That Meat and No Potatoes LyricsA man works hard then comes on home
Expects to find stew with that fine ham bone
He opens the door, then start to lookin'
Says, Woman, what's this stuff you're cookin'?
Now all that meat and no potatoes
Just ain't right, like green tomatoes
Here I'm waiting, palpitatin'
With all that meat and no potatoes
All that meat and no potatoes
All that food to the alligators
Now hold me steady. I am really ready
Now all that meat and no potatoes
I don't think that peas are bad
With me most anything goes
I look into the pot. I'm fit to fight
'Cause, woman, you know that mess just ain't right
All that meat and no potatoes
Just ain't right, like green tomatoes
Woman, I'm steamin'. yeah really screamin'
All that meat and no potatoes
I don't t think that beans are bad
With me most most anything goes
(that's what I like about you)
Looked in the pot, what a sight
Cause woman you know without rice beans just ain't right
All that meat and no potatoes
Just ain't right, like green tomatoes
Now woman, I'm steamin'. yeah really screamin'
(it ain't rationed)
All that meat and no potatoes
Where is my fry and ham bone? Where is it?Embed
