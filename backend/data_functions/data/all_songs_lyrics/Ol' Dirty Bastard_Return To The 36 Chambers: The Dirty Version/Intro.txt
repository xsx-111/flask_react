Intro Lyrics
Ah-uh, I nev'-I never saw so many people tonight
I mean y'all all got it crowded up in here and that's good
I'm glad that y'all givin' it up for, um, y'all givin' it up for him
That's good, y'all-y'all make me want to cry or somethin'
Alright lad'-ladies and gentleman, tonight is a special night
For one thing let me introduce myself, my name is Mr. Russell Jones
Excuse me for that one, I-I had to let that one loose, well now, ah-ahh
And tonight, you're going to see something that you never seen before
Somethin' that, nobody in the history of rap ever set they self to do
This fuckin' guy, that I speak to you about, is somethin' crazy
He's somethin' insane, he's the greatest performer ever since, uh
What's the guys name? (Ol' Dirty)
Ah, ah, ah James Brown, he's bad, and he's a cool guy
And you'll really need, I mean need to really get to know him
Ladies and gentleman, from all houses, to all towns
From the moons of Pluto, back down to earth
Ladies and gentleman, one more time, give it up for
The Old Dirty Doggy, I mean, the Ol' Dirty Bastard
I love that guy
(Ol' Dirty)

Yes, how y'all doin' out there?
I wanted y'all to know that tonight is a special night
'Cause I'm happy to be living, you know?
A nigga tried to shoot me down and shit
You know? And, I don't know man, it just feel good to be here man
You know what I'm sayin'?
And I wanna let all y'all know I love you man, I love all y'all
You know, but, what I really came here tonight
For one reason, just 'cause I don't mean to cry, I don't usually cry
Dub you can play that shit man, play it man
'Cause I'm tired of this shit, remember the time I told y'all
When I got burnt, gonorrhea, yeah
Well this bitch, there's a new bitch, goddamnit
Oh, bitch burnt me again with gonorrhea
So I didn't get burnt one time, I got burnt actually two times
If you really look at it
Yeah, I love the girl but I had to cut the bitch off
Yeah the bitch died, I killed the bitch
She suffered a long pain
But she had to go, bitch had to go
I-I knew the bitch for ten minutes of my life
But the pussy was good, yeah the pussy was good, oh shit, the pussy's good
I just want you to know girl
That I dedicated, this song, well this song really was written by Blowfly
And I want all y'all to hear this shit
It's just a poem that I writ for you girl
Just let me get my shit together
The first time, ever you sucked my dick, uh-ah
Thank you, thank you
I felt, the earth tremble under my balls
Somethin' shot out of me real fast
First time
Nah I'm just kidding with y'all
How y'all feelin'? Listen to the album 'cause it's bangin'
We have only thirty-five chambers, there is no thirty-six
I know that, but, I want to create a new chamber
Oh? And what would that be?7Embed
