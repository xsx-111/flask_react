Shimmy Shimmy Ya Lyrics
"Aw, I don't want to fuck you. You can't even sing!" You had to sing, or something, to get some pussy

Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw

Shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta go through one killer bee and he aim for the kill now
Chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage and then I dip down
(I like the way you talk)
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw


Shimmy, shimmy, ya, shimmy, yam, shimmy, yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah, from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta go through one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage and then I dip down
Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, yeah
Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam
Shi-shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shi shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shimmy shi-shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Give me the mic so I can take it away, shimmy shimmy ya

You can't even sing. You have to sing or something to get some pussy
ADDITIONAL EXTENDED VERSE

See, when a nigga say he likes it raw
Keepin' it dirty, down to the floor
See my name is the ODB and I'll beat your ass
For the ladies who know me tell them who the fuck I be
For the niggas who know me tell them who the fuck I be
My style comes down on y'all like rocks
(Sitin' on the dock of the bay) By the dock!
(Aiyaiyaiyaiyaiyaiyaiy...) Umm by the flock
(Don't goooooo) By the creak by the flock
Got east coast locked down padlocked
My Zoo niggas be all all down by the flock
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw

Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta go through one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage and then I dip down
(I like the way you talk)
Yo, y'all know the lyrics, come on, sing with me

Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
