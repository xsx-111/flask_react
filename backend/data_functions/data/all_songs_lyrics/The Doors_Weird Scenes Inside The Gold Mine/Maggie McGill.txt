Maggie McGill LyricsMiss Maggie M'Gill, she lived on a hill
Her daddy got drunk and left her the will
So she went down, down to Tangie Town
People down there really like to get it on
Now if you're sad and you're feeling blue
Go out and buy a brand new pair of shoes
And you go down, down to Tangie Town
'Cause people down there really like to get it on
Get it on
Illegitimate son of a Rock n' Roll star
Illegitimate son of a Rock n' Roll star
Mom met dad in the back of a Rock n' Roll car
Well, I'm an old blues man and I think that you understand
I've been singing the blues ever since the world began
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie M'Gill
Roll on, roll on, Maggie M'Gill
