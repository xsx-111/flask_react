Hey Tomorrow Lyrics
Hey tomorrow, where are you goin'?
Do you have some room for me?

'Cause night is fallin', and the dawn is callin'
I'll have a new day, if she'll have me

Hey tomorrow, I can't show you nothin'
You've seen it all pass by your door

So many times I said I'd been changin'
Then slipped into patterns of what's happened before

'Cause I've been wasted and I've over-tasted
All the things that life gave to me
And I've been trusted, abused and busted
And I've been taken by those close to me

Well, hey tomorrow, you've gotta believe that
I'm through wastin' what's left of me
'Cause night is fallin', and the dawn is callin'
I'll have a new day, if she'll have me

'Cause I've been wasted, and I've over-tasted
All the things that life gave to me
And I've been trusted, abused and busted
And I've been taken by those close to me

Well, hey tomorrow, where are you goin'?
Do you have some room for me?

'Cause night is fallin', and the dawn is callin'
I'll have a new day, if she'll have me

I'll have a new day, if she'll have meEmbed
