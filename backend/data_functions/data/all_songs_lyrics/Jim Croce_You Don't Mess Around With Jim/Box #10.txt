Box #10 LyricsWell, out of Southern Illinois
Come a down home country boy
He's gonna make it in the city
Playin' guitar in the studio
Well he hadn't been there an hour
When he met a Broadway flower
You know she took him for his money
And she left him in a cheap hotel
Oh, well, it's easy for you to see
That that country boy is me
Saying "And how am I gonna ever
Break the news to the folks back home?"
Well, I was gonna be a great success
Things sure ended up a mess
But in the process I got messed up too
"Hello Mamma and Dad I had to call collect
'Cause I ain't got a cent to my name
Well I'm sleepin' in the hotel doorway
And tonight they say it's gonna rain
And if you'd only send me some money
I'll be back on my feet again
Send it in care of the Sunday Mission
Box number ten."
Well, back in Southern Illinois
They're still worryin' 'bout their boy
But this boy's goin' home soon's he get's the fare
Because as soon as I got my bread
I got a pipe upside my head
You know they left me in an alley
Took my money and my guitar, too
"Hello Mamma and Dad I had to call collect
'Cause I ain't got a cent to my name
Well I'm sleepin' in the hotel doorway
And tonight they say it's gonna rain
And if you'd only send me some money
I'll be back on my feet again
Send it in care of the Sunday Mission
Box number ten."Embed
