Drifter in the Dark LyricsDo you ever walk alone?
Like a drifter in the dark
Seeking out what isn't there
Looking only for a spark
From a girl who's all alone
Maybe she's a' driftin' too
Like a shadow in the night
Waitin' just to meet with you
And then perhaps in love you'll stay
Or fall and go your separate ways
Still searchin' for a spark
Like a drifter in the dark
Do you ever walk alone?
Like a drifter in the dark
Seeking out what isn't there
Looking only for a sparkEmbed
