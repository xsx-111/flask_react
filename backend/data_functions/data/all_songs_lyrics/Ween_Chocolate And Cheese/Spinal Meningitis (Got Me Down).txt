Spinal Meningitis (Got Me Down) Lyrics
Why they wanna see my spine mommy?
Why they wanna see my spine?
It's gonna hurt again, Mommy!
Much worse than last time!
Am I gonna see God, Mommy?
Am I gonna die?
It really hurts, Mommy!
Am I gonna die?

Smile, almighty Jesus
Spinal meningitis got me down
Smile, almighty Jesus
Spinal meningitis got me down

I'm feelin' greasy, Mommy!
Please don't let me die!
Stinky vaseline, Mommy!
Please don't let me die!
Am I gonna see God, Mommy?
Am I gonna die?
It really hurts, Mommy!
Am I gonna die?
Smile, almighty Jesus
Spinal meningitis got me down
Smile, almighty Jesus
Spinal meningitis got me down1Embed
