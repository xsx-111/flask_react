Voodoo Lady Lyrics
Voodoo Lady, shaking that stick and driving me crazy
Your eyes look red and hazy
Doing that stuff that you do
Messing me up with your voodoo

You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie, boogie, boogie

Your lips are hot and spicy
Serving up red beans and rice
At midnight she's a' howling and stomping
Making love to the gators in the swamp

You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie, boogie, boogie

I feel you now inside me
Never once did you deny me
Doin' that stuff that you do
Knockin' me out with your voodoo
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie boogie boogie

Voodoo Lady, shaking that stick and driving me crazy
Voodoo Lady, oh yeah

Voodoo Lady, shaking that stick and driving me crazy
Your eyes look red and hazy
Doing that stuff that you do
Messing me up with your voodoo

You drive me crazy with that
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie
You drive me crazy with that
Boogie boogie boogie1Embed
