Take Me Away Lyrics
Well, take me away to some other land (Thank you)
I gotta get away from that girl before I go a' crazy
She took my love away, she took it to another man
Now I gotta get away from that girl before I go a' crazy
Take me away to some other land
I gotta get away from that girl before I go a' crazy
She took my love away, she took it to another man
Now I gotta get away from that girl before I go crazy
Well, take me away to some other land (Thank you)
I gotta get away from that girl before I go a' crazy
She took my love away, she took it to another man
Now I gotta get away from that girl before I go a' crazy

Take me, oh take me away


Gotta get away
Crazy
She took my love away
Now I gotta get away, oh
Take me away to some other land
I gotta get away from that girl before she drives me crazy
She took my love away, she took it to another man
Now I gotta get away from that girl before she drives me crazy3Embed
