Call Out (Laundry) Lyrics
I would say I'm sorry but I'm not sorry
I would say, "Hey, what's the difference?"
Entertain my lack of interest
'Cause the one you are ain't the one that I'm after
Closing in on your heart with the worst of intentions
(I call out)

I could send you all away
I can see you from the foot of my bed
I can't make out a face
Don't ever ask me how I spend the only part of my life I like
All locked away inside a bedroom
On the handlebars of your bike
I rode a wave of emotion I can't begin to place
And as we sat by the ocean, it crawled across your face
I call outEmbed
