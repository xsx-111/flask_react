Katie Cruel - Live in Copenhagen LyricsWhen I first came to town
They called me roving jewel;
Now they've changed their tune
Call me Katy Cruel
Through the woods I'm goin'
Through the bogs and mire
Straightway down the road
To my heart's desire
When I first came to town
They gave me drinks of plenty;
Now they've changed their tune
Bring me bottles empty
Through the woods I'm goin'
Through the bogs and mire
Straightway down the road
To my heart's desire
Through the woods I'm goin'
Through the bogs and mire
Straightway down the road
If I was where I would be
Then I would be where I am not
Here I am where I must be
Go where I would, I cannot
Go where I would, I cannot
Go where I would, I cannot
Go where I would, I cannot
Go where I wouldEmbed
