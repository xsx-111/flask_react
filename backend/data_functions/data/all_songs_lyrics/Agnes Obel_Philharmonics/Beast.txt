Beast LyricsI would know who roars mostly like the beast
Going out to hunt and then back to feast
I consider you, I consider you
I consider you
From your hill of beans I will sit and roar
Thinking to myself: What are you waiting for?
I consider you, I consider you
I consider you
Let's go tonight, let the beast run a mile
With the dogs and the cattle, let's go
I know you said it's like a heel to the head
Or a girl in your bed and in your arms
Curiousity you do not know
But with a gang of me you'll be on your toes
I consider you, I consider you
I consider you
For a bit of skirt you do go my way
Singing to the sky, oh like a bird of prey
I consider you, I consider you
I consider you
Let's go tonight, to let the beast run wild
With the dogs and the cattle, let's go
I know you've said, it's like a heel to the head
Or a girl in your bed and your arms
For the butter on your bread, for the dying and the dead
For your cheeks turning red, let's go
Let's go tonight, let the beast run a mile
With the dogs and the cattle, let's go2Embed
