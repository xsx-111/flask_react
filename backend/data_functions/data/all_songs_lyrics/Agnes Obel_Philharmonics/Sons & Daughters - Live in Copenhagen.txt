Sons & Daughters - Live in Copenhagen LyricsWe are the ones of the free
The sons and daughters
Come with us, you will see
Our future
We borrow, we play
For we know nothing will stay unchanged
Anyway
Moving fast with no weight
Upon our shoulders
Nothing in our world
Will ever hold us
We borrow, we play
For we know nothing will stay unchanged
Anyway
Can you hear what we say
While you fear us?
Can we call you again
While you're near us?
We borrow, we play
For we know nothing will stay unchanged
Anyway
Unchanged anywayEmbed
