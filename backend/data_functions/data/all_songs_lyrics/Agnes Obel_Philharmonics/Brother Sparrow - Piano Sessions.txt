Brother Sparrow - Piano Sessions LyricsVoices in the street
Footsteps on the concrete
Guess I hear just every sound
On the ground
From my window view
I know a color blue
That can bite so very hard
The day apart
Picture fresh as water clear
Days have passed without you here
Street lights dancing on the dark
Across the park
Waiting for a word from you
Waiting for a sign or two
Footsteps on the city ground
You know the sound
Brother Sparrow
Come tomorrow
To my window
Brother Sparrow
Come tomorrow
To my windowEmbed
