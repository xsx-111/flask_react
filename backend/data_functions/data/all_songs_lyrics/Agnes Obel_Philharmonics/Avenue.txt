Avenue Lyrics
What is wrong at the end of the day
What is really wrong no one dares to say
You know you're wrong when there's only one right
But what is wrong when right is out of sight

Right rode away long ago
Before rescuing wrong from below
I might be mistaken I know
But hey we need to be somewhat

Foolish, feebleminded
Wrong and senseless
Right rode off long ago
There's nothing more you need to know
There's nothing more you need to show
Let us disagree
'Cause wrong was made for you to be

What is false when we can't hear no more (Oh)
And there is nothing to cover for (Oh)
What is wrong in this old wasted game
Right and wrong be one and the same
Right rode away long ago
Before rescuing wrong from below
I might be mistaken I know
But hey we need to be somewhat

Foolish, feebleminded
Wrong and senseless
Right rode off long ago
There's nothing more you need to know
There's nothing more you need to show
Let us disagree
'Cause wrong was made for you to be
