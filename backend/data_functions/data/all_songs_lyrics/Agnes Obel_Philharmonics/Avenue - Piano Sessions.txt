Avenue - Piano Sessions LyricsWhat is wrong at the end of the day
What is really wrong no one dares to say
You know you're when there's only one right
But what is wrong when right is out of sight
Right rode away long ago
Before rescuing wrong from below
I might be mistaken, I know
But hey we need to be somewhat
Foolish, feebleminded
Wrong and senseless
Right rode off long ago
There's nothing more you need to know
There's nothing more you need to show
Let us disagree
Cause wrong was made, for you to be
What is false when we can't hear no more
And there is nothing to cover for
What is wrong in this old wasted game
May right and wrong be one and the same
Right rode away long ago
Before rescuing wrong from below
I might be mistaken, I know
But hey we need to be somewhat
Foolish, feebleminded
Wrong and senseless
Right rode off long ago
There's nothing more you need to know
There's nothing more you need to show
Let us disagree
Cause wrong was made, for you to beEmbed
