On Powdered Ground LyricsGo back and forward
But all is melting like the snow
Taking all from us
All we thought was left to know
On what we treasure
Falls a dusty snow
Taking us backwards
But where we will never know
Don't break your back on the track
Don't break your back on the track
Don't break your back on the track
Don't break your back on the track
This strong old blizzard
I will let it blow
To undiscovered places
Underneath the snow
Don't break your back on the track
Don't break your back on the track ...1Embed
