Close Watch - Live in Copenhagen LyricsNever win, never lose
There's nothing left to choose
Between right and wrong
Nothing lost, and nothing gained
Still things ain't quite the same
Between you and me
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I still hear your voice at night
When I turn out the light
And try to settle down
But there is nothing I can do
Cause I can't live without you any way at all
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep a close watch on this heart of mineEmbed
