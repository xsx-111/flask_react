Dawn Chorus LyricsBack up the cul-de-sac
Come on, do your worst
You quit your job again
And your train of thought
If you could do it all again
A little fairy dust
A thousand tiny birds singing
If you must, you must
Please let me know
When you’ve had enough
Of the white light
Of the dawn chorus
If you could do it all again
You don't know how much
Pronto pronto, moshi mosh
Come on, chop chop
If you could do it all again
Yeah, without a second thought
I don't like leaving
The door shut
I think I missed something
But I'm not sure what
In the middle of the vortex
The wind picked up
Shook up the soot
From the chimney pot
Into spiral patterns
Of you, my love
You take a little piece
Then you break it off
It's a bloody racket
It’s the dawn chorus
If you could do it all again
Big deal, so what?
Please let me know
When you've had enough
It's the last chance
O.K. Corral
If you could do it all again
