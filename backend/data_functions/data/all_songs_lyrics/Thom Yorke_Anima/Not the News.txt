Not the News Lyrics
Who are these people?
I'm in black treacle
Cue sliding violin
In sympathy

But I'm not running
Enough of broken glass
Enough so I can eat
The dancing feet

A fortune teller
Sea bird feather
Cue the sliding violins
In sympathy, yeah

But I'm not running
Enough of broken glass
Enough so I can eat
My dancing feet4Embed
