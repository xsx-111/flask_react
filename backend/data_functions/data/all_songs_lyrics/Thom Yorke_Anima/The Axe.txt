The Axe Lyrics
Goddamned machinery
Why don't you speak to me?
One day I am gonna take an axe to you
The pitter patter
What does it matter?
And where's that love
You promised me?
I'm pierced by long nails
By coloured windmills
Your soft sustaining
Envelope
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal

You bastards speak to me
Have you no pity?
Give me a goddamned good reason
Not to jack it all in
You wooden soldiers
I'm daring you to turn yourselves on
I thought we had a deal

(Could've loved me)
(I've had my fill)
(I've had my fill of hurt)
(Had had my fill of hurt)2Embed
