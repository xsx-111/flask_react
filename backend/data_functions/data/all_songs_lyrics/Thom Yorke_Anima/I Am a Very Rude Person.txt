I Am a Very Rude Person Lyrics
Won't bother me
You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me
You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me
You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me
You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me

I have to find my way in the dark
(You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me)
I have to take a knife to your art
(You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me)
I have to find some way to escape
(You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me)
I have to walk but I wanna stay
(You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me)

I have to hope this spell's going to break
(You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me)
I have to destroy to create
(You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me)
I have to be rude to your face
(You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me)
I'm breaking up your turntables
(You don't mean a thing, but it won't bother me)
Now I'm gonna watch your party die2Embed
