Twist Lyrics
To you who brought me back to life
To twisted thorns that grow inside
The shingle washing my old bones
Of woe betides and woe begones
With just enough love to go 'round
For you who's turning me back on
Doesn't make it right or wrong
For prisoners of the mind
Of woe begones and woe betides
And just enough love to go 'round

And just enough love to go 'round
To you who holds the fireflies
Pulls them out from the inside
A tiny shell left in my hand
Sings woe betides and woe begones
With just enough love to go 'round

It's like weed
It's like weed
It's like weed
It's like weed
A boy on a bike who is running away
An empty car in the woods, the motor left running
It's like weed
It's like weed
It's like weed
It's like weed
An empty car with the motor left running
Look, this face, it isn't me
Look, this face, it isn't me7Embed
