Impossible Knots Lyrics
I'm heading in the wrong direction
I can't make the big connection
And in my line of business
There is no room for mess

I'm tied up in impossible knots
I'll take anything you got
I'll take anything you got

I'll be ready
I'll be ready
I'll be ready
I'll be ready
I'll be ready
I'll be ready
I'll be ready
I'll be ready1Embed
