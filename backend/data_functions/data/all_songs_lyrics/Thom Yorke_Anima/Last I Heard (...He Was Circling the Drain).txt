Last I Heard (...He Was Circling the Drain) Lyrics
I woke up with a feeling I just could not take
I woke up with a feeling I just could not take
I woke up with a feeling I just could not take
I woke up with a feeling I just could not take

Taken out with the trash
Swimming through the gutter
Swimming through the gutter
Swallowed up, swallowed up by the city, by the city, by the city
Humans the size of rats
Opportunity cracks, opportunity stutters
It only takes a minute
And it takes it, and it takes it, and it takes it, and it takes it

I woke up with a feeling I just could not take
I woke up with a feeling I just could not take
I woke up with a feeling I just could not take
I woke up with a feeling I just could not take

(Walking in high heels)
(I woke up with a feeling I just could not take)
(Trying hard to leave)
(I woke up with a feeling I just could not take)
(Breaking in your high heels)
(I woke up with a feeling I just could not take)
(Trying hard to leave)
(I woke up with a feeling I just could not take)
(Walking in high heels)5Embed
