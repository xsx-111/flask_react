Traffic Lyrics
Submit
Submerged
No body
No body
It's not good
It's not right
A mirror
A sponge
But you're free

Show me the money
Party with a rich zombie
Suck it in through a straw
Party with a rich zombie
Crime pays, she stays
In Kensington and Chelsea
And you have to make amends
To make amends to me

I can't breathe
I can't breathe
There's no water
There's no water
A drip feed
Foie gras
A brick wall
A brick wall
But you're free
Show me the money
Party with a rich zombie
Suck it in through a straw
Party with a rich zombie
Yeah, crime pays, she stays
In Kensington and Chelsea
And you have to make amends
To make amends to me2Embed
