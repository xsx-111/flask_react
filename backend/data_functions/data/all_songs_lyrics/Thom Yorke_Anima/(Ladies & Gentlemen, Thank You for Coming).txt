(Ladies & Gentlemen, Thank You for Coming) Lyrics
A fork comes in the road
A fork comes in the road
You are on your phone
You are on your phone
A mist comes through the trees
Beckoning you and me
I think I'm asleep
I must be asleep

It's like we've become distracted
We've become distracted
Two feet off the ground
I'm two feet off the ground
We're just skin and bone
We're just skin and bone
 (Note: Refrains 3 & 4 are only used in the early demo version)
I'm two feet off the ground
And I'm two feet off the ground
I think I'm asleep
I think I'm asleep
It's like we've become distracted
We've become distracted
We couldn't make the mental leap
Couldn't make the mental leap
We're just skin and bone
We're just skin and bone
We're waiting for the lights to change
We're waiting for the lights to changeEmbed
