The Faded Line LyricsWitness shame's parade
The pain of blame repaid
It's fucking hopeless
Accusations and denial
Hopeless
Demon of another day
Colorless
Stoned, solid gray
Emptiness
Of promises I made
So faithless
The tenants long betrayed
Walk the faded line, cursed crawl of time
Silence, the only promise ever kept
Familiar touch
A ritual to numb the cut
Salvation in vice
Anguish is realizing what could have been but never was
It's emptiness that fills the cup
Devotion in the method of my fall
Pointless
Futility continuing
Endless
Flowing corrupted vein
Walk the faded line, cursed crawl of time
Walk the faded line, cursed crawl of time
Silence, the only promise ever kept
It's fucking hopeless
Hopeless
Hopeless
It's fucking hopeless
