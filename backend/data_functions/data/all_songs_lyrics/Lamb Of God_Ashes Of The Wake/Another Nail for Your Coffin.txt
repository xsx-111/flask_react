Another Nail for Your Coffin Lyrics
At a loss for something different to say
I've said everything, we've said it all before

An extra nail for your coffin

I'm going to ride that horse we've beaten to death
And deliver its stinking carcass to your doorstep
A gift from all the dead children
That are the progeny of your ballistic union

Borrowing from Peter to rape Paul
No news is good news
But I've got some news for you
Fetch me a rope, lynch mob of one

An extra nail for your coffin

Certain blood has been shed for uncertain reasons
You will never quiet this storm
A cold wind to chill your bones
I bring the hammer down
Borrowing from Peter to rape Paul
No news is good news
But I've got some news for you
Fetch me a rope, lynch mob of one1Embed
