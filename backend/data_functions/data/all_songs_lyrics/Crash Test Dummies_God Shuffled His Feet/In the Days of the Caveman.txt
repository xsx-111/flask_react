In the Days of the Caveman Lyrics
When you go on camping trips
You're stuck right out in nature
Forage in the forest like a primate
Using sharpened tools instead of hotplates
Your thumb and forefinger
Supposed to show you're not a wild beast
You can hear the noises at night time
They don't have to keep a certain bed time

See in the shapes of my body
Leftover parts from the apes and monkeys

Sometimes when I lie awake
I hear the rainfall on my tent fly
I think of all the insects that are sleeping
And wonder if the animals are dreaming

In the days of the caveman
And mammoths... and glaciers
Bugs and trees were your food then
No pyjamas or doctors
And when I finally get to sleep
I dream in technicolors
I see creatures come back from the ice age
Alive and being fed inside a zoo cageEmbed
