Two Knights and Maidens Lyrics
Once, there were two knights and maidens
They'd walked together
Out in the gardens
In all kinds of weather
The knights always pestered the maidens
To love them together
Out in the gardens
And they could watch each other

The maidens had other plans for the two knights
They'd give them potions
Make them see dreams and lights

The knights took the potions gladly
They laughed at their visions
But outside the garden
Tigers smelled them together

The maidens had other plans for the two knights
They'd give them potions
Make them see dreams and lights
The knights only laughed at the tigers
They thought they were visions
Out in the garden
The maidens watched them together

Ah, but for the two knights
Ah, but for maidens
Who gave to them dreams and lightsEmbed
