Paralyzed Lyrics
This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip, don't fall
You'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die

It lies deep inside
You cannot hide
It's the meanest fire
Oh, it's a strange desire
You can not lie
That's a needless fight

This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip, don't fall
You'll lose it all
The sweetest way to die

When your blood runs dry
You're paralyzed
It will eat your mind
Did you hold it back?
It comes to you in slow attacks
It's the meanest fire

This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip, don't fall
You'll lose it all
This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip, don't fall
You'll lose it all
This is where your sanity gives in
And love begins
Never lose your grip
Don't trip, don't fall
You'll lose it all
The sweetest way to dieEmbed
