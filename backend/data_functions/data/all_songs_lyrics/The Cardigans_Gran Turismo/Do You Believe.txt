Do You Believe Lyrics
Do you really think
That love is gonna save the world?
Well, I don't think so
(Do you believe)
I just don't think so
And do you really think
That love is gonna save your soul?
Well, I sure hope so
(Do you believe)
Oh, I really, really hope so
But I don't think so

Do you really think
That love is gonna save the world?
Well, I don't think so
(Do you believe)
I just don't think so
And do you really think
That love is gonna save your soul?
Well, I sure hope so
(Do you believe)
Oh yes, I really, really hope so
But I don't think so
Do you believe
Do you believe
Do you believe
