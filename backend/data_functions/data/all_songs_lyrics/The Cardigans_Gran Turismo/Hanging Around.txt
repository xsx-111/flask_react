Hanging Around Lyrics
I wonder what it's like seeing through your eyes
You've offered me to have a try but I was always late
The filters that I use give me an excuse
I take away what's real, I feel it and it blows my fuse

I hang around for another round
I'm hanging around for another round
I'm hanging on to the same old song
I hang around for another round
Until something stops me

I wonder what it's like walking by your side
To think before I talk and to move at the same speed as you walk
I wanna have a way to keep me in your state
I'm watching from above, I love it but it's not for me

I hang around for another round
I'm hanging around for another round
I'm hanging on to the same old song
I hang around for another round
Until something stops meEmbed
