Junk of the Hearts Lyrics
We never chose to part
In this stupid play
And I never felt by heart
That I could behave
The way the roles were made
I know that I've done you wrong
But you're hard to please
When your faith is gone
And when you can't believe
I'm on my hands and knees

The junk of the hearts
The junk of the hearts

The junk of the hearts
It's the junk of the hearts
The junk of the hearts
It's the junk of the hearts

I've given all of me
And you crave for more
Weird how this makes us feel
Insecure
That's what friends are for
The junk of the hearts
The junk of the hearts

The junk of the hearts
It's the junk of the hearts
The junk of the hearts
It's the junk of the hearts

The junk of the hearts
The junk of the hearts
The junk of the hearts
It's the junk of the heartsEmbed
