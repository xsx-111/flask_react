Marvel Hill Lyrics
Strange to be on Marvel Hill
I've walked some years to find
I know there is a piece to fill
The gap I have in mind
No, nothing's here, I close my eyes
It's on the other side
And what I've worked so hard to gain
I'd gladly give away

Cause I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more

A postcard from where life is a thrill
On top of Marvel Hill

But I don't need this
I don't need it
I need more
No, I don't need this
Too good to be true
Too good to ignore
I don't need this
I need so much more
It's too much to ask forEmbed
