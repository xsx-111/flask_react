Erase/Rewind Lyrics
Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm

Hey, what did you hear me say
You know the difference it makes
What did you hear me say
Yes, I said it's fine before
But I don't think so no more
I said it's fine before

I've changed my mind
I take it back

Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
I've changed my mind

So where did you see me go?
It's not the right way, you know
Where did you see me go?
No, it's not that I don't know
I just don't want it to grow
It's not that I don't know

I've changed my mind
I take it back

Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind

Erase and rewind
Hmm-hmm
Erase and rewind
Hmm-hmm
I've changed my mind5Embed
