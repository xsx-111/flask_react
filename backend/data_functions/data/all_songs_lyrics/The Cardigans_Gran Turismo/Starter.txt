Starter Lyrics
This is a start that I know I'll believe in
So I'm leaving everything behind
Keeping the parts that I know I'll be needing
And I breed to be a better kind
And I'm leaving everyone behind
This is the age when my past should be gone
But it's just stronger than the aims I have
Turning the pages I used to hang on to
I was young and I have changed my mind
And I'm leaving everything behind

New beginning again a bit closer
New beginning again a little bit closer
New beginning again a bit closer to the end
A new beginning again
A little bit closer to the end

This is the time, it's a delicate line
To the beginning of what's yet to come
Lifetime of changes, a strange generation
Explanations never come in time
So I'm leaving everything behind
New beginning again a bit closer
New beginning again a little bit closer
New beginning again a bit closer to the end
A new beginning again
A little bit closer to the end
A new beginning again
A little bit closer to the endEmbed
