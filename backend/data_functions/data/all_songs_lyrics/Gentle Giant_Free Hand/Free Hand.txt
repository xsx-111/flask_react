Free Hand LyricsWho would believe me now that my hands are free, that my hands are free
I never thought it would ever come to me, ever come to me
Now that my life's my own, I leave you behind, leaving you behind
What ever made you think that I'd change my mind, that I'd change my mind
It wasn't hard to run, break away from you, break away from you
After all you'd done, what was I to do, what was I to do
Who's gonna take my place in the games you play, in the games you play
Nobody's listening now to the things you say, all the things you say
Now my hands are free from the ties, from the ties
Now I look forward to the future, where it lies
And with you, feeling low, looking black
Here, now my head is clear, why should I look back
When it was over did you have regrets, did you have regrets
Or did you really think it was over yet, it was over yet
Now that my life's my own I leave you behind, leaving you behind
What ever made you think that I'd change my mind, change my mind
That I'd change my mind. That I'd change my mind
Who would believe me now that my hands are free, that my hands are free
I never thought it would ever come to me, ever come to me
Now that my life's my own, I leave you behind, leaving you behind
What ever made you think that I'd change my mind, that I'd change my mind
It wasn't hard to run, break away from you, break away from you
After all you'd done, what was I to do, what was I to do
Who's gonna take my place in the games you play, in the games you play
Nobody's listening now to the things you say, all the things you say
Everything you say...Embed
