Mobile LyricsUp, up, time to fly
Moving all around, going everywhere from town to town
All looking the same, changing only in name
Days turn into nights, time is nothing only if it's right
From where you came don't you think it's a game
No, no, don't ask why
Do it as you're told, you're the packet, do it as you're sold
To all your friends, none for you at the end
Give them all you can, finish stronger than when you first began
You never pretend, all for you at the end
Time, time, say goodbye
To another place, hoping that you're seeing what you chase
All things as they should, always thought that they would
So you're racing ahead, home is just your shelter and your bed
You do all you could, yesterday not as good
There are no hours, there are no seasons
Only the present, choice is the reason
Up, up, time to fly
Moving all around, going everywhere from town to town
All looking the same, changing only in name
Days turn into nights, time is nothing only if it's right
From where you came, it's you who's taking the blame
Give them all you can, finish stronger than when you first began
You take the acclaim, don't you think it's a gameEmbed
