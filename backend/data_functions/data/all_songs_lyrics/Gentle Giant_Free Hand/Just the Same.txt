Just the Same LyricsSee me, what I am, what I was, what I'll be
Hear me, understand that I'm not what you see
Take this, take the man, middle term, common me
Don't you see that I'm just doing what I want to do?
Nothing more and nothing less than you
Read no thoughts I didn't think myself
Just the same as anybody else
Make me someone else, put me up on a stand
Something that I don't really want on my hands
Use me, idolize all you can understand
Don't you see that I'm just doing what I want to do?
Nothing more and nothing less than you
Read no thoughts I didn't think myself
Just the same as anybody else
Change it, what you think, what you thought, what you say
Look for something more than you sought yesterday
I don't want to be part of your life today
Don't you see that I'm just doing what I want to do
Nothing more and nothing less than you
Read no thoughts I didn't think myself
Just the same as anybody elseEmbed
