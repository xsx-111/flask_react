Time to Kill Lyrics
Rests where he's staying, nowhere he knows
A place where nobody cares
Where he's straying, or where he goes
To find no-one in particular, footloose, adventure still
No thoughts for reasons, he does all he's doing, has time to kill
And still, he's killing the time

Sundowner, drifting from place to place
Where all he needs is a shelter from seasons he has to face
No bounds or duties are his, never seeking to find an end
For life goes on being life, time and fortune, he needs no friends
And yet he's killing the time

Where does he come from, what did he do?
You know the answers are his hopes and promises, nothing new
With no regrets, he goes on doing nothing, himself alone
But still he finds all the time isn't wasted, his life his own
And yet he's killing the time

And with no questions then, he finds his way...
Tomorrow's never dawn, only today...
Content within his time, he just drifts away...
He finds his way...
He finds his way!
Sundowner, drifting from place to place
Where all he needs is a shelter from seasons he has to face
No bounds or duties are his, never seeking to find an end
For life goes on being life, time and fortune, he needs no friends
And yet he's killing the time

Where does he come from, what did he do?
You know the answers are his hopes and promises, nothing new
With no regrets he goes on doing nothing, himself alone
But still he finds all the time isn't wasted, his life his own
And yet he's killing the timeEmbed
