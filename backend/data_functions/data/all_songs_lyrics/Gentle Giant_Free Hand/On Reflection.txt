On Reflection LyricsIn my way did I use you, do you think I really abused you
On reflection now it doesn't matter:
How can you say I made you need me more than anyone else
Who can say it right now it's finished over:
It's my act, it's my calling, I explained exactly the falling
Different ways of life can never even:
Be the same when you saw me, could you always take me the
Same way  As I came and went I tried to remember you:
Still, you stay
Tied in your way
Changing times
Watching the signs
How:
Could you see in me what you thought about all you want me to be
Now:
On reflection why should have I changed my ways for you
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
Cry my sympathy's with you but I never lied to you all in all
It seems it's just an experience:
Placed my cards on the table told of everything I was able
Understanding still, not anything different:
Find another to lean on, start again for I should have long
Gone, on reflection now it's just an experience:
Soon the pain will have ended, together never intended, as I
Come and go I'll try to remember you:
Still, you stay
Tied in your way
Changing times
Watching the signs
How:
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years
That we shared in our way:
Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and
Our time drifting away:
I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years
That we shared in our way:
Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and
Our time drifting away:
Look back it's not your game, together just in name
I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years
That we shared in our way:
Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and
Our time drifting away:
I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years
That we shared in our way:
Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and
Our time drifting away:
I'll remember the good things how can you forget all the years
That we shared in our way:
Things were changing my life, taking your place in my life and
Our time drifting away:
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all around
All around all around, all around all aroundEmbed
