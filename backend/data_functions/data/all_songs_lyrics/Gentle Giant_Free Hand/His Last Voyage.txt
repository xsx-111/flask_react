His Last Voyage LyricsRose in early morning, as the light came through
Searching in the ocean, did what he should do
Seeking not adventure, just a way of life
Sky above turned grey, wind cut like a knife
This was his last voyage, this was his last time
Pulling up the anchor, letting go the rope
Age rules over all things, fate rules over hope
Then as bow was broken, water soon to rise
For they would have nothing, Nature's trust unwise
Through his boat and fortune, not for him that day
If he went to God, for him they would pray
As the tempest thundered, as the storm broke free
Suddenly in darkness, fear there none to see
Visions in his memory, what was meant to be
When the storm was over, nothing could be seen
Life and boat were taken, God knows what it means
Rose in early morning, as the light came through
Searching in the ocean, did what he should do
This was his last voyage, this was his last time
Pulling up the anchor, letting go the rope
Age rules over all things, fate rules over hopeEmbed
