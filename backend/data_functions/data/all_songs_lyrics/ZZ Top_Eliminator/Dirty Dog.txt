Dirty Dog Lyrics
It's a dirty dog song

Hey baby, watcha you gonna do?
Now that I've left you
And I said we're through
All along you been running round
But you ain't the only game in town

I dug your brush and your ass was fine
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind
But you rubbed it on another guy
You're history and this is why
You're just a dog, a scurvy dog
Hey baby, when we got it on
You made me feel like
There ain't nothing wrong
Just don't bug me like you're so na√Øve
I'm cracking up, I'm gonna take my leave

I dug your brush and your ass was fine
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind
But you rubbed it on another guy
You're history and this is why
You're just a dog

Hey baby well it's over now
I'll make my exit and I'll take a bow
Your problem's cured with a dollar bill
And if it won't I know a flea collar will

I dug your brush and your ass was fine
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind
But you rubbed it on another guy
You're history and this is why
You're just a dog, a scurvy dog
Hey, get that dog out of my yard!
