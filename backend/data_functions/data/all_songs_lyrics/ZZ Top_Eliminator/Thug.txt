Thug Lyrics
You look like who you say you are
So scoot over let me drive your car
Roll down the glass
And give me some wind
Lock all the doors
I'm on the loose again, alright

I haven't sat behind a wheel like this
Since that job in 1956
Can't wait till I can do it again
Can't keep my nose
Clean living in sin, alright

I had a friend down in Alcatraz
He had the money
And machine guns stashed
We busted out June 21
We going to rob, steal
Toting our guns, alright
