Got Me Under Pressure Lyrics
She likes wearing lipstick
She likes French cuisine
But she won't let me use my passion
Unless it's in a limousine

She got me under pressure
She got me under pressure
She likes the art museum
She don't like Pavlov's dog
She fun at the mind museum
She likes it in a London fog

She don't like other women
She likes whips and chains
She likes cocaine
And flipping out with great Danes
She's about all I can handle
It's too much for my brain

It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure

I'm gonna give her a message
Here's what I'm gonna say:
"It's all over"
She might get out a nightstick
And hurt me real, real bad
By the roadside in a ditch

It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure
It's got me under pressure
