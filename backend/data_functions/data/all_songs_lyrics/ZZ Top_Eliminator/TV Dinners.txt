TV Dinners Lyrics
TV dinners
There's nothin' else to eat
TV dinners
They really can't be beat
I like em' frozen
But you understand
I throw em' in and wave em'
And I'm a brand new man
Oh yeah

TV dinners
They're going to my head
TV dinners
My skin is turnin' red
Twenty year old turkey
In a thirty year old tin
I can't wait until tomorrow
And thaw one out again
Oh yeah

TV dinners
I'm feelin' kinda rough
TV dinners
This one's kinda tough
I like the enchiladas
And the teriyaki too
I even like the chicken
If the sauce is not too blue
And they're mine
All mine, oh yeah
And they sure are fine
Woo, gotta have them
Give me something now
Ow!Embed
