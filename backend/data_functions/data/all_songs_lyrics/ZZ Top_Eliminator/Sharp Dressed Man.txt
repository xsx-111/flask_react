Sharp Dressed Man Lyrics
Yeah

Clean shirt, new shoes
And I don't know where I am goin' to
Silk suit, black tie (Black tie)
I don't need a reason why

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Gold watch, diamond ring
I ain't missin' not a single thing
Cufflinks, stick pin
When I step out, I'm gonna do you in

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Uh-huh
Top coat, top hat
And I don't worry 'cause my wallet's fat
Black shades, white glove
Lookin' sharp, lookin' for love

They come runnin' just as fast as they can
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man

Oh, you can't lose with the dress I use
That's right, real fine7Embed
