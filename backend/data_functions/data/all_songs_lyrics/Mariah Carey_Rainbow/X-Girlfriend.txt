X-Girlfriend Lyrics
Oh
No, no-no

Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
Ex-girlfriend, you don't listen (Ex-girlfriend)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go

Hey, ex-girlfriend
It's too bad, when you had him, your thing didn't work
But he's all mine now, so stop pursuin' him
Before you get your feelings hurt
See, our love is hot and no, it won't stop
'Cause I got him on lock
And although he rejects you
It don't seem to affect you
'Cause you just keep tryin' to get with him
So don't, don't keep, keep calling (Keep)
Hanging up the phone (Hang)
When I answer, I know it (Know)
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence (Why?)
On the other end
Till I hang up, and you (Hang)
Predictably call right back again? (Ex-girlfriend)

Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know? (He's moved on)
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (Let him go)
Ex-girlfriend, you don't listen (Ex-girlfriend)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know? (You've got to)
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (Let him go)

Hey, ex-girlfriend
Whatever your name is, I'm really not amused
'Cause the things you do are very offensive
And sometimes straight-up rude
All those late night calls and notes on his car
Won't get you anywhere
You can call his mom as much as you want
And he won't really care
So don't, don't keep, keep calling (Keep)
Hanging up the phone (Calling the phone, yeah)
When I answer, I know it
Tears you up inside and (Inside)
Why do you sit in silence (Why do you sit in silence?)
On the other end
Till I hang up and you
Predictably call right back again? (And you can keep calling him up)

Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him (Oh, you)
It's about time that you found you a new man (Can't have him)
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (That you've gotta let him go)
Ex-girlfriend, you don't listen (Ex-girlfriend)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know? (Stop trying)
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (He's not giving in)

I understand why (I understand why you want him)
You want him back
But you need to know
Our love's too strong
For you to penetrate
It's too late, he's not your baby no more
Ex-girlfriend, ex-girlfriend
(It's time to let him go)
Ex-girlfriend
(Ex-girlfriend, don't listen)
Ex-girlfriend
See, he's not gonna give in
Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him (No)
It's about time that you found you a new man (No)
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know? (He's moved on)
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (Don't you know?)
Ex-girlfriend, you don't listen (Ex-girlfriend)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know? (Ah)
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (Said you've gotta leave him, I know that hurts)
Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him (Ex-girlfriend)
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on (Don't you know?)
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (You've got to let him go)
Ex-girlfriend, you don't listen (Go)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in (Go)
He's not yours anymore, don't you know? (Go)
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him (Go)
It's about time that you found you a new man (Go)
He's moved on (Go)
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (Go)
Ex-girlfriend, you don't listen (Go)
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in (Go)
He's not yours anymore, don't you know? (Go)
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go (Go)3Embed
