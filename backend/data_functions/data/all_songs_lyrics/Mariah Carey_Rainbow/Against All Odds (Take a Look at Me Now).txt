Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now) Lyrics
Whoa

How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've gotta face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
So there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face

Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
That's the chance I've gotta take

Hey, yeah
Whoa
Take a look at me now
