Heartbreaker (Remix) Lyrics
Blazing hip-hop and R&B
DJ Clue
Desert Storm
New Mariah
Often imitated, never duplicated
Let it on
But they can't do it like this though
W-C-L-U-E
Wahoo
Just play the record, Clue

Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With two big tig ol' bitties for your mouth?
Heartbreakers must parttake of the sensation
So So Def and Clue, hits in the making
Oh, guess who dropping the five-double-o
Like yippy yi, yippy yo, yay
When I talk smack y'all better skip back
Like here we go
'Cause the bitch don't play

Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do the things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me (You've got the best)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (Keep coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me? (I should have known)
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Give me some real love
Need someone to give me some real love
Need someone (Said I need somebody) to give me some real love
Need someone to give me some real love

Why when I met ya that night, baby
I didn't know it wouldn't last
I give my love to you, honey
Wish I could take it all back
See, I have never met a guy
That was better at telling lies
Should've known you'd break my heart
If Da Brat gave a fuck about a nigga
My heart would be broke
Shoulda known you were star struck
When I let you stroke
My guard was up in the beginning
But then I gave you my heart and you broke it again
I'm a fool when you smile at me, I'm convinced
I get caught in you and I just can't resist
I know you lie to me
It just drives me nuts
That one kiss could persuade me to believe your bluffs
You set it up, impress me with gifts and rings
I wish love was dollars, 'cause money ain't a thing
Clue-minati and MC move the party
I got a .42 calibur ready to blaze somebody
It's that dumb as you
It's that for each member of my crew
In fact, I'ma heart-break you
Now you flat on your back
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust me yo

Baby, I'm the real thing (One, two)
So why you got me sweating you consistently, baby? (One, two)
Baby, I got that good thing
So why you making love to me? You crazy, baby
I like the way he used to spank me
He used to lie me on my back take that
He used to have me in the sack, legs back
But now, he be buggin' lately
Hey boy, why you actin' stanky? (Uh-huh)
I keep it stiff like wood, baby (Baby)
So if you wanna keep a good lady
You need to stop with all the heartbreaking
(Oh, boy) Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
(Why, did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
That you'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me (Give me some real love)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
(Give me some real love)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
(Give me some real love)
I should have known right from the start (Give me some real love)
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly9Embed
