Heartbreaker Lyrics
Yeah
We're gonna do it like this
Aight
Let's go
Jigga

Gimme your love
Uh
Gimme your love
What?
Gimme your love
MC
Gimme your love
Uh, jigga
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Hey
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
You gotta bounce to this like this
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
You almost gotta watch and listen
Gimme your love
Uh-huh
Gimme your love
Woo
Gimme your love
X-Scape
Gimme your love
Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all

Boy, if I do
The things you want me to
Uh-huh
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Uh-huh
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Uh-huh
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
What?
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
She said
Gimme your love
What?
Gimme your love
She said
Gimme your love
Uh-huh
Gimme your love
Gimme your love

It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love
To you
But I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do
The things you wanna do
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby (Love me, oh)
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

(Heartbreaker, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me (You got the best)
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on, keep on)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
(Why, why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(The start that you'd go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart

I'm all over ready
Okay, cool, alright
She wanna shop with Jay
Play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya", but she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all

(Oh boy, you got the best of me)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly (I keep on coming back)
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me
(Why did you have to run your game?)
I should have known right from the start
(Right from the start that you'd)
You'd go and break my heart (Go and break my heart)
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me?
(I should have known) I should have known right from the start
(That you would go and break my heart)
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

(Boy, if I do) Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
(The things you want me to)
(The way I used to do)
Oh, why did you have to (Would you love me, baby?)
Run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
(Or leave me feeling used) Right from the start
(Would you go and break?) (My heart)
You'd go and break my heart

Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Gimme your love
Damn straight
Gimme your love
That's a wrap15Embed
