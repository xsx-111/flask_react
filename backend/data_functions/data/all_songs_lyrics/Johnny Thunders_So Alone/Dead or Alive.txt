Dead or Alive LyricsIt's so hot in here
I can't keep it clear
Every word I say to you
Baby, it's so dear
And when you stop me
'Cause I'm moving too fast
It finally happened to me
It finally happened to me
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Baby, I want you
I don't know what to do
I'm finally turning blue
Every word I say to you
Baby it's so dear
And when you stop me
'Cause I'm moving too fast
It finally happened to me
It finally happened to me
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Baby, I want you
Baby, I gotta
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Baby I want you
It's so hot in here
I can't, can't breathe clear
Every word I say to you
Baby, it's so dear
Baby, can you stop me
'Cause I'm moving too fast
It finally happened to me
It finally happened to me
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
It's dead, it's alive
It's dead, it's alive
It's dead, it's alive
It's dead, it's alive
It's dead, it's alive
Baby, I want youEmbed
