Great Big Kiss Lyrics
When I say I'm in love you best believe I'm in love, L-U-V

Here comes my girl
Walking down the street
See how she walks
She's got a dancing beat
Thick wavy hair
Just a little too long
All day long
She's singing a song

When I see her in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
I gotta walk right up to her
Give her a great big kiss! Mwah!
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I care
Tell her that I'll always be there
Gotta always be there Gotta always be there
Gotta always be there Gotta always be there

Hey Johnny, what color are her eyes?
I dunno, she always wears shades
Is she tall?
Well, I gotta look up
Yeah, well I hear she's pretty bad
Well, she's good bad, but she's ain't evil
Tell me whole Tell me more
Tell me whole Tell me more
Big bulky sweater
Gonna match her eyes
Dirty fingernails
Oh boy, what a prize
Tight tapered pants
High button shoes
She's always looking
Like she's born to lose

And when I see her in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to her
Give her a great big kiss
Tell her that I love her
Tell her that I care
Tell her I'll always be there
Tell her I'll always be there
Tell her I'll always be there
Oh, what the hell

Is she a good dancer?
Waddya mean, is she a good dancer?
Well, how does she dance?
Close, very, very close
Tell me more Tell me more
Tell me more Tell me more
Tell me more Tell me more
Gotta always be there Gotta always be there
Gotta always be there Gotta always be thereEmbed
