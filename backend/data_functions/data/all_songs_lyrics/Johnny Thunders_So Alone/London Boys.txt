London Boys Lyrics
You best believe I'm from New York City

Well you're telling me to shut my mouth
If I wasn't kissing, you wouldn't be around
You talk about faggots, you little mama's boy
You sit at home, you got a chaperone
You need an escort to take a piss
He holds your hand and he shakes your dick
You're so pretty, suburban kitty
You think you're gonna change, rearrange my city?

Little London boys
You're little London boys
You're little London boys
You think you're gonna fool me?
Haha! Hahaha, hahaha!

A little rich kid, what do you know?
You hide everything, don't you think it don't show
And I've been a-climbing, just a face to the wall
Too much too soon, do you recall?
Have a holiday in the city
A-stealing souvenirs, vaseline pretty
You don't need no drugs, just LSD
You won't get shot, shot by me
A little London boy
A little London boy
You're a little London boy
And I'm talking about the whole lot of ya!


Too bad the boys don't know
And the girls, they don't go
Everybody just shows
You're little

Little London boy
You're a little London boy
You're a little London boy
You're a little London boy
You're a little London boy
You're a little London boy
You're little...
You're little London boys
You poor little puppet1Embed
