Ask Me No Questions Lyrics
That was then (That was then)
And now it's today (And now it's today)
Do you remember (Do you remember)
What I used to say... to you?
That was the past (That was the past)
And that was the last (And that was the last)
Do you remember (Do you remember)
How long ago the last was... for lasting you?

Seems like I never ever learn
And it's always my turn to lose

Ask me no questions
And I'll tell you no lies
Ask me no questions
I'll be yours tonight
Ask me no questions
And I'll tell you no lies
Ask me no questions
I'll be yours tonight

Seems like I never ever learn
And it's always my turn to lose

Ask me no questions
And I'll tell you no lies
Ask me no questions
I'll be yours tonight
Ask me no questions
And I'll tell you no lies
Ask me no questions
I'll be yours tonight

Ask me no questions
Ask me no questions
Ask me no questions
No questions
No questionsEmbed
