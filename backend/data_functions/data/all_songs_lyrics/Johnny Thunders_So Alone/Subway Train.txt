Subway Train Lyrics
I can't ever understand
Why my life's been cursed, poisoned, condemned
I try every night just to hold you near me
But I'm telling ya, baby, it ain't easy

Ever since I been riding
Right on the subway train
I hear the whistle blowing
You might think I'm insane

You stop and you stare
As I leave your place
With no regards
And not even a trace
You go back to Rosie
That's all she's ever gonna be
She got the poison black art of the pimps
Don't you stick it in me

Ever since I been riding
Right on the subway train
I hear the whistle blowing
You might think I'm insane
You stop and you stare
As I leave your place
With no regards
And not even a trace
I wrote you an epic letter, but it never got sent
Reminding me of the days we got bent
Hey, remember?

Ever since I been riding
Right on the subway train
I hear the whistle blowing
You might think I'm insane

Well, someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
I know
Well, someone's in the kitchen with Dinah
I just know

And I tell ya now
Dinah, won't you blow?
Dinah, won't you blow?
Dinah, won't you blow your horn?
Dinah, won't you blow?
Dinah, won't you blow?Embed
