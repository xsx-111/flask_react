Leave Me Alone LyricsI don't where I'm goin'
I don't know where I've been
If ya help me darlin'
I'm gonna let you in
All greased (juiced?) up
I got nowhere to go
Seems like a quiet night
On the telephone
Dig it...
My little chatterbox
Boy you squawk a lot
C'mon, gimme some lips
Yeah, chatterbox
Do you remember?
Aw, leave me alone
Why don't you all go home?
No matter what you say
It's the other way
Aw, leave me alone
Aw, leave me alone
Aw, leave me alone
Aw, leave me alone
Dig it...Embed
