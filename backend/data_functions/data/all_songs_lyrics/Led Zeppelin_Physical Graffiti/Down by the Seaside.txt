Down by the Seaside Lyrics
Down by the seaside
See the boats go sailing
Can the people hear
Oh, what the little fish are saying?

Oh oooh
The people turned away, oh
The people turned away

Down in the city streets
See all the folk go racing, racing
No time left, oh no
To pass the time of day

Hey, hey, yeah
The people turned away
The people turned away
So far away, so far away

See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run...
Do you still do the twist?
Do you find you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you
Some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, ohh
Out in the country
Hear the people singing
Singing about their growin'
Knowing where they're goin'
Yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, the people turned away, yeah
Oh, the people turned away

Sing loud for the sunshine
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature
And she will come back again
Yeah, yes, she will

Oh, the people turned away
The people turned away3Embed
