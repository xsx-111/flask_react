Another Time LyricsLying awake
I look out my window
Wondering to myself
If this madness will ever seize
Oh but I see a light
I see a crack of hope
And I close my eyes
They can't tear this love apart
Though they try
Should we believe in the things they say?
Oh, but how would they know
'Cause in another time another place
It might have been so different
Oh, we set aside the world
We'll laugh, we'll show them all
If we can float across the stream
Just smile and float across the stream
We'll see it all pass us by
You know what?
They don't know
'Cause in another time, in another time, another place
It might have been so different
Oh, but here we are
And here we'll stay
We'll set aside the world
We can float across the stream
We can float across the stream
Find the path we want
I know we will, I know we will
Find the path we want
Reach across the hill and
Reach across the hill
We gonna go believe me we gonna go
We gonna make it
We gonna make it
'Cause nothing can stop us now
No, no, nothing can stop us now
We gonna make it
Yes, we gonna make it, girl
Because nothing can come between us
Not now, nothing can come between us
We try so hard
We can do it
We can do it
We can do it if we want
We can do it, girl
We can do it
We're gonna cross the stream
Find the path we want
Lying awake
I look out my window
Wondering to myself
Will this madness ever seize
Oh, but I see a light
I see a crack of hope
And I close my eyes
I close my eyes
Nothing can come between us now
We close our eyes
Close our eyesEmbed
