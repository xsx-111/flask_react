Just Another Story Lyrics
Father comes home 'cos his money's run out
Seems a little loose tonight, he starts to shout
Dinner's not on the table, seems mother's not able
She's staring at the TV
You can smell it on his breath, feel it in his touch
He never meant to hit her hard, but he's like that when he's had too much

It's just another story about going too far

Well the kid's at school, she's getting good grades
But the peer pressure's starting now - too bad, she had it made
Seems there's always someone trying to push you to do something, you know, ain't the way they told you to
It's hard to see
The things you taught her, how to be, it's like you told her nothing, selective memory
Come on just try it, it's just a smoke, ain't gonna kill you, so she takes a toke
Fade to grey


Well the guys at work seemed OK, they'd buy you a drink, get you laid, what's wrong with that?
Why'd they have more money than you, expensive cars, expensive clothes, d'you ever think of what they do?
At night they're out, shaking people down, when they're walking together seems they own the town
But hey, who's gonna talk, you are their alibi, don't turn around, don't ask questions, just walk
