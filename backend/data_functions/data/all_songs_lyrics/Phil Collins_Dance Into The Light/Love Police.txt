Love Police Lyrics
Sometimes I lie awake, wondering if I'll make it out of here
But the wind blows round my heels, so I stay
I remember lying there, wishing I could be someone else
Trying to find somehow to get away

If I asked him nicely d'you think he's show me how to fly
'cos the dust has weighed my wings down, and I'm too tired to try

Sometimes I sit here hearing voices in my head
I try to understand, to make some sense
I wonder if I had to, would I lie to save myself?
A plea of guilty, but self defence


Try, all of my sins
'cos I can't stop now
Just don't leave me behind
