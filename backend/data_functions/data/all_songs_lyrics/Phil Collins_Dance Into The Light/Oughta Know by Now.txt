Oughta Know by Now Lyrics
You oughta know by now
That a man can't hold on forever
So why do you keep waiting here
When you know it makes me want you more?
You ought a know by now
How it fells to be loved
So why d'you keep me hanging here
With this stone around my heart, dragging me down, down, down

When all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you
Let me in, let me in

You ought a know by now
Or maybe someone should show you
That a man needs to be loved
And even in this man's world
With you it don't come easy
You ought a know by now
That no man can sleep at night
With a burning in his heart
That would tear this man apart
Take me out of my misery
Cause all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you
Let me in, let me in

You oughta know by now
Just how good it feels to be wanted
And no man could love you more
So why can't you show me something
Just a little bit of something?
You ought a know by now
All the things a man has to do in his life
And all these things I do
You know that I do it all for you, I do it all for you

When all I'm trying to do is trying to get next to you
Let me in, let me in

Let me in, let me in
Let me in your heartEmbed
