River So Wide Lyrics
If we can cross at the place that divides us
Cross the river, the river so wide
If we can smother the pain that's inside us
Deny the demons that wait bu our side
We can find, find the light

Our nights are filled with the light of the same moon
We share the comfort of the same stars
Our days are bright with the light of the same sun
That don't matter, can't you see what we are
What we are, what we become?

Keep our sights on the way ahead
Don't look back, it won't help us now
The storm we left so far behind
Seems a dark memory that starts to fade
But till we see the light we will not be safe

We all sink or swim in the same ocean
Break our skin and we will bleed
Our minutes pass with the same motion
We face the same danger, we share the same needs
We're all the same, you and me
