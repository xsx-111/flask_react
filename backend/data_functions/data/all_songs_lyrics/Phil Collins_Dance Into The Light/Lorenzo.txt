Lorenzo Lyrics
Once upon a time I made a lion roar
He was sleeping in the sunbeams on the old zoo floor
I had gone to see the park where my papa used to play
It's called called Villa Borghese and it's on the way

Back to To east Africa

Down on Grand Comoro Island, where I grew past four
I could swim and fish and snorkel on the ocean floor
And the wind laughed, and the wind laughed through the trees as if to say
Here's a child who'll want the world to go his way


Suddenly for me the world turned upside down
Far from my friends the lions and the dolphins came this awful sound
Dark shadows, sounds of thunder raging over me
Came this monster called 'A-dre-no-leu-ko-dys-tro-phy


Well they said, they said, they said (the ones who know it all)
They said from now on for you there will be no more standing tall
So I took my parents hands, I lifted my head to say
I'll just have to be a hero, there's no other way!

I am going back to east Africa
Come with me I am going back
Well I think I am going back
COme with me to east AfricaEmbed
