No Danger LyricsI've been hanging round for days
Still confused about the way you came
Take the portraits from the wall
Take them down and burn them all
I know what I've become
By the marks upon their arms
There was nothing that they lacked in charm
But now I've got to choose
Who from you is gonna lose
And who is going through
By the stories that were told
I decided to reject the bold
Embrace the cowardly and the weak
We had laughs that lasted weeks
They're inside and I sing here
Now I would swear this life is you
You've been around since we were twenty two
But now you've got the rush
When you're cold and when you're touched
I know things don't mean much
Cause we don't know we're strong enough
And chances come too soon
But people, people, we're not in love
And now we're singing out of tune
Just go out and get it straight
There are questions here that just can't wait
Leave romantics to their spite
Leave the footballs to their pints
Alternatives we'll find
But there's nothing we can find
While our lives are plush and kind of fine
So we'll all call it a day
People follow in our wake
A nothing's hall of fame
Cause we don't know we're strong enough
And chances come too soon
But people, people, we're not in love
And now we're singing out of tune
Come on babies, find a vein
Roll your sleeves up, find your arms insane
Walking out in little lines
Down the corridors of life
And on to what you'll find
Out the door and down the street
Over fences glens and ditches deep
And who from us is gonna choose
Who will win and who will lose?
I know it won't be me
Cause we don't know we're strong enough
And chances come too soon
But people, people, we're not in love
And now we're singing out of tune
Cause we don't know we're strong enough
And chances come too soon
But people, people, we're not in love
And now we're singing out of tuneEmbed
