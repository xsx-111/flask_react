Knowing When To Run LyricsBoy looks so scared lying under the stairs
Begs for mercy from all of his tortuous days
Put out a pray lying under stairs
But I'm sorry to tell you it's over, my friend
Now that you stand in the calm of the landing
A child at your feet, nothing left in your soul
What was the point that you could not go back?
When your foot hit his face? When your fist broke his back?
Oh, our lives in the slurry
Momma's here so don't worry
Who was there when you walked out the door?
Bloody bundle picked up from the floor
It's ours
Back from the country on business today
And a boy and problem are buried away
Things that some can
Oh, the things that some can't
Mother picks up his hair
Washed his blood off the lamp
Oh, our lives in the slurry
Momma's here so don't worry
Who was there when you walked out the door?
Bloody bundle picked up from the floor
It's ours
It's our time
How can he show
How he will grow?
You're not gonna knowEmbed
