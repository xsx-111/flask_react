Thirteen Gliding Principles LyricsIf you care / Do you run
Not to stare / For your fun
Light the light / Or do you slide
And take the time / The underside
I've been there / Lock the door
I have stared / Wax the floor
And I have seen / Shine the shine
Things unseen / From indoors
Take it back / Did you choose
Heart attack / To amuse
A setting sun / Did you leave a smile?
What we've begun
Where you fall / You hit the ground
Children saw / Without a sound
About your life / You planned it from the start
Jesus wept
I don't decide it, I only abide by it
Keep me beside you and I will confide
Simply the sound of it carries me down with it
Plain on the outside and coloured inside
Things we've said / Could you say
When we're dead / You haven't paid
Dragons fed / Watch your words
And unfed / As they're relayed
Take the car / Falsify
Drive it far / What went by
Drive it far / Glorify the same
Stay out
Exiled years / You're twice the years
Forty fears / Half the fears
No one came / The middle man
No one stayed / Is not so clear
About your life / You hit the ground
About your wife / Without a sound
It's got to end / You planned it from the start
I don't decide it, I only abide by it
Keep me beside you and I will confide
Simply the sound of it carries me down with it
Plain on the outside and coloured inside
Look what you've left me, your bottles of camomile
Funny old phrases and outdated style
At least I'll be clean with it, sliding at ease with it
First to the finish, last on the floorEmbed
