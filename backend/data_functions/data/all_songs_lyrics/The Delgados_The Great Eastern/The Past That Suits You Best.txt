The Past That Suits You Best LyricsSalt in my eyes, stinging my brain
It's been forty odd days since we've been clean
Crawl in the cave looking for light
But the ceiling descends and still it's dark
Hey there, don't declare
Optimist
It's clear you resist
I try all the time
To get it right
And still it persists
Touched that you think I'm a heartless old crank
And there's things that I've done to convict me of that
Try to look out eyes straight and fast
But I've struggled of late, my head in the past
Hey there, don't despair
Get in the cave
We live day and night
To find the right
Sort of light
Bored of the truth I return to my youth
Drinking Breaker at night in the cold Duchess light
Out by the fence there's a shout and I'm dead
Get me out of this place, I'll take casuals another day
All gates are locked, there's no way I can walk
And the paths that I took led me into the swamp
Even this trusty accomplice gets rusty
I'm not being cruel but your brain never ruled
I've seen the trauma of lives that were squandered
But I'm not to blaim for showing restraint
Hey there, don't declare
Optimist
I try every night
To get it right
And still
Something just fucking ran out behind me I swear to God
Probably a fucking moth knowing you
Why don't you go back and see then?
Well naw
No path of truth led me where I could walk
But the lies that I made led me out of the swampEmbed
