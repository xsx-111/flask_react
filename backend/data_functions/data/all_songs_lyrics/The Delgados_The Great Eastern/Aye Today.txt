Aye Today LyricsSongs sung out of key
Reminds me that I'm free
Feelings so strong that I can't carry on
Good night, sleep tight
Sends me out to sea
A rowboat just for me
It cuts to the core, I can't take anymore
Make good out in the wood
So long, glad that you're wrong
Jesus, you're such a lush
Now that I'm crushed
I've always stated of things overrated
A curse or a blessing rate high
Over in my head I welcome the undead
Animals, insects and lies
So, will you be mine
For part of the time?
Now that he said you'd be better off dead
Make good out in the wood
So long, glad that he's wrong
Jesus, you're such a lush
Now that we're cursed
I've always stated of things overrated
"A curse or a blessing rate high"
Over in my head I'd welcome the undead
Animals, secrets and lies
Out with regression and in with progression
A shining example for saints
Why all the grief for a life full of peace?
If you will ask me I'll say
