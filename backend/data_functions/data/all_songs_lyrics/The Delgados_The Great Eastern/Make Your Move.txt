Make Your Move LyricsFinish what you've started here
You make your move just one a year
In the city, in the town
Your happy home is never found
Secondhand was never planned
The birth was over, the baby banned
She fled the place at such a pace
She never even saw your face
So go
With me
Inside
Believe
You have
So much
To give
Switch the light off, have a go
Force the only one you know
To leave this place without a trace
A pity I had seen your face
Where do you think I will find
This party girl who was so kind?
Raven hair and skin so fair
Sadness never visits there
So go
With me
Inside
Believe
You have
So much
To giveEmbed
