Witness LyricsWill you join me? I want to live these years again
There is no dignity in losing a friend
We were younger and thought our time would never end
And if I try too hard I miss you
And if I miss too hard I find you
And we have ten years gone to get through but it all feels over
Do you have the time?
Inclination?
Does it feel too right?
How can we continue with better things behind you ?
Do we have to fight?
Complications
Just to feel alright?
We spent our years dreaming but our dreams were misleading
And now we're through
Please forgive me, I won't invite you in next time
But did you change at all when you witnessed the crime ?
Stand your ground now and make sure it's a happy home
And while your choice of friend was touching, was it reason for adjusting?
And when you go to sleep are you wondering if it all makes sense now?
Do you have the time?
Inclination?
Does it feel too right?
How can we continue with better things behind you?
Do we have to fight?
Complications
Just to feel alright?
We spent our years dreaming but our dreams were misleading
And now we're through
Do you have the time?
Inclination?
Does it feel too right?
How can we continue with better things behind you?
Do we have to fight?
Complications
Just to feel alright?
We spent our years dreaming but our dreams were misleading
And now we're through
And I hope you've found
What you're after
Leave another town
Visits in the country were over all too quickly
And I hope we meet
Before we're older
Have a chance to speak
We spent our years dreaming but our dreams were misleading
And now we're throughEmbed
