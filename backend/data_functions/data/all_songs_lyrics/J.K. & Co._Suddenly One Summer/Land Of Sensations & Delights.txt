Land Of Sensations & Delights LyricsIf you turn and you want outside your mind
I'll show you a place I think is fine
It's the land of sensations and delights
And it's filled with such wonderful sights
The music there will make you want to wander
And you will find that you are here no longer
You will find the grass is greener there
Smiling faces everyone will wear
The mountains there are high and very steep
You'll climb and climb until you reach your peak
And everything  so slow
The loveliness there is something that you'll knowEmbed
