Little Children LyricsLittle children with magic in their eyes
Watch them play, hear them laugh with the sun
Picking flowers and tumbling through the grass
With no cares, their whole life's just begun
Skipping through meadows
And climbing like monkeys through trees
They love one another
They trust and they care for each other
Making mud pies and rolling in the leaves
Watching squirrels or catching frogs in a brook
Talking with birds or just playing with 
Singing songs or telling storybook rhymes
Discovering treasures
And cowboys and Indians are 
Finding a bird sing
Tossing a rock as high as the sun
Finding a penny or drawing a picture in the dirt
 and flies in the noon of the day
Sun is gone, little children have all gone home to bed
Just to wake up for their brand new day
La la la la, la la la
Da da da, da da da, da
Da da da da da
Da da da da da, da
Little children with magic in their eyes
Watch them play, hear them laugh with the sunEmbed
