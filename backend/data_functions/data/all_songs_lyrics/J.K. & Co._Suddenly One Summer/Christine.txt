Christine LyricsChristine
I've just seen the story in your eyes
You're very much in love to my surprise
Is it me?
Is it me?
Tell me Christine, is it me?
Christine
I am wondering what you're gonna do
Should I tell you I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
I'm in love with you
Christine, I'm in love with you
Let me kiss your rosy lips and stroke your dark brown hair
Let me gaze into your eyes and say without a care at all
"We will have a ball!"
Christine
I wonder have your body and your love
I don't care what anybody says to me
Can't you see that I love you?
Christine
That is all that I have got to sayEmbed
