Fly Lyrics
If you want to fly
All you gotta do is let me do everything
Just let go of your mind
Don't worry, everything will be just fine

And if you find yourself inside your mind
Don't be sad, be glad

You'll find your way
You'll find your way
And when you reach your land
Lie down, relax, and drift away-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay...

And if you find
You're not the kind to face the pain
Of reality
Stay by my side
And we will find a place to stay
In all its splendid beauty

Lights that shine in the dark
Don't worry, it's just his eyes
His flashing eyes have reached inside
You'll find you'll have a lovely timeEmbed
