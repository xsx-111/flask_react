Dead LyricsIt's not real
What I feel
Can it be?
Am I dead?
I can feel the cold, cold ground
And I hear no kind of sound
My eyes, they feel like lead
Am I dead?
What is this place I'm in?
What's happening to me?
I can see them look down
I am dead
Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God, of his great mercy, to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed, we therefore commit his body to the ground; earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust; in sure and certain hope of resurrеction to eternal life, through our Lord Jеsus Christ, who shall change our corruptible body that it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working, whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost; as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen
