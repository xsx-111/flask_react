The Times LyricsI've been thinking of all the times
That are gone and are yet to come
The days'll be a-changin'
And with them, so will I
To look at nature's beauty
And feel each drop of rain
To watch and hear with laughing
As they lap against the shore
To be playing in the snow
Or dancing through leaves in the spring
Or walking down a deserted street
In the late, late, warm summer eve
La la la la
La la la la la
Playing with a yo-yo
When I've got nothing to do
Watching TV quite late at night
Or just being here with you
Watching other people
As they go 'bout their way
Spending some hours in the green grass park
Or maybe even a day
These times I will remember
As I move along
Although they're gone, I'll remember them
And think of times to comeEmbed
