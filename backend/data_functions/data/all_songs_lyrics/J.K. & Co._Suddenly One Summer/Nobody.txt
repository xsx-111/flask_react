Nobody LyricsThe days pass so slowly
Since I don't have you
My nights, they are so lonely
There's nothing can do
My happiness is in a needle
I will escape for another day
Pain is my pleasure
Loneliness is my friend
Don't cry for me, my children
I'll cry for me instead
Instead
I try to find a reason
And know that there are none
I shut away the present
I live for just the past
Just the past
My days, they die so slowly
Since I don't have you
My nights, they are so lonely
So lonely
So lonelyEmbed
