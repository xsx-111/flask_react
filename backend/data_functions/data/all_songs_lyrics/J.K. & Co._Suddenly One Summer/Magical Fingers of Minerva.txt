Magical Fingers of Minerva LyricsThe magical fingers of Minerva
Reach out to touch thine head
The karma which turns into nothing
Who happens once again
The cerebrum wit spirals
In your sad but exuberated brain
Hare Krishna, undemented
Grasps your lifeless soul
Simultaneously, but out of time
You never reach your goal
You climb until the time
Has come for you to go
Electric beams of candlelight
Will light up every day
Bright new lights of antiquity
Will show you what to say
So laugh my friend
Whoa, yet to mayEmbed
