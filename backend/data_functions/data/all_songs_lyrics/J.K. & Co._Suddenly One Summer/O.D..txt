O.D. LyricsThe man with the glass in his eyes is on the bed
He's so quiet, is he sleeping or is he dead?
He told me to bring him the saddle and horse which he scored
He thanked me for bringing them in and he closed the door
Ahh, ahh, ahh...
The cries and the scream that was heard from behind the wall
Suddenly silence was heard, I heard nothing at all
Ahh, ahh, ahh...
Come everybody, now fold your hands and bow your heads
The man that was trappеd by the horse now is pronounced dеad
Ahh, ahh, ahh...Embed
