Let Me Go Lyrics
Down in the streets outside of Washington, D.C
I wasted all my time and you were there with me
Back then it meant so much to have you by my side
I always had your back and you always had mine

Saying, "Let me go have some fun
Well, my decision sucks to you
But I'm so young."

We'd hang out late and fight just trying to have fun
We were such punk ass kids but we knew everyone
And who could see through such blazed up bloodshot eyes
There was a plan for us one day we'd realize
