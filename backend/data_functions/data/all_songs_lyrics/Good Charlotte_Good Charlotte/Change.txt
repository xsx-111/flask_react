Change Lyrics
Oooooooh
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on

I am lost in the see-through
I think you lost yourself too
Throughout all of this confusion
I hope I somehow get to you
I practiced all the things I'd say
To tell you how I feel
And when I finally get my chance
It all seems so surreal
Cause from the first time I saw you
I only thought about you
I didn't know you
I wanted to hold onto
The things you'd never say to me
Cause you said

You can't change the way you feel
(I could never do that, I could never do that)
But you can't tell me this ain't real, cause this is real
(and you would see right through that)
And in the end its all I've got (so I'm gonna hold onto that)
So I'm gonna hold
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
And now you've got me watching your eyes
(watching just to see, watching just to see)
You got me waiting just to see
(if you'll ever look at me)
If it goes the way it never will
(will it ever go, will it ever go my way)
Your eyes are watching me
Ohhh
And now you've got me thinking bout
The first time that I met you
Standing in a crowded room
But I could only see you
And I hope my words will get through
Cause now I can't forget you
I want to tell you
If only I could reach you
And make you feel this way
But you said

You can't change the way you feel
(I could never do that, I could never do that)
But you can't tell me this ain't real, cause this is real
(and you would see right through that)
And in the end its all I've got (so I'm gonna hold onto that)
So I'm gonna hold
On and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and on and on
Ooooooh on and on and on
Oooooh oooh, on and on and on and onEmbed
