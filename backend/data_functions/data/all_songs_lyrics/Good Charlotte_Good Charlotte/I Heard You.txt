I Heard You Lyrics
Yeah
For all the popular kids
Yeah listen up
C'mon
Get up
Today I screwed up again
You said I could tell in the way
You said goodbye
I saw you sitting at your t-shirt stand
With your new boyfriend
He's really cool
I get the point

I don't want you
(I heard you, I heard you)
I don't
I heard you say not a chance, what don't you see?
I don't want you
(I heard you, I heard you)
I don't
I heard you say you're not good enough for me

What
Do your thing
C'mon
Today I screwed up again
I wasn't paying attention
I walked into the wall again
I heard you laugh and saw you grin
While you were sitting at your t-shirt stand
With all your cool friends
They're really cool
I get the point


Today I'll give it one last try
And then I know I'll wonder why
I did it to myself once again
I saw your boyfriend he's 6'3"
Quarterback on varsity
The football players love to torture me
So I'm feeling like I'm not fitting in
I know that I'm not fitting in with you
And your stuck-up friends
I get the point

Go, yeah
I heard you
You're not good enough for me
I heard you
C'mon
I heard you
I get the pointEmbed
