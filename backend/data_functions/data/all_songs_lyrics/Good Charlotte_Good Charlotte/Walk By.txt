Walk By Lyrics
Rock and roll!
Yeah! Uh! C'mon!
Yeah! Uh! Let's go

She walks down to the store at 8
The devil walks with her and he thinks she's great
And when she looks at me I don't know what I saw
I think he's trying to make me his son-in-law

When she walked by, walked by
Walk by, she walked on by
Walk by, walk by
Walk by, she walked on by
Let's go! Yeah!

Eagles fly when she walks by
She caught my eye on October 9th
It was 22 days before Halloween
How did I know she'd be my evil queen?

My mother warned me against girls like you
She said, Stay away from them son, you know they're not true
All they're gonna do is put you under a spell
And when you're fallin' down you're goin' straight to hell!"
Let's go! Yeah! Uh! C'mon!
