Complicated Lyrics
(One) Uh, Alright, here we go (Get Down)
One time for your mind, your body and your soul
Every time that I rhyme, you know I'm in control, alright
Here we go, Here we go, Here we go

And we've been here for so many years
Still it seems as if you're not there (are you there?)
Every time I talk, you turn away (do you care?)
Isn't Dad an obligation to care?
And we said

And we've been here for so many years
So many years still it seems, (what?)
So complicated (yeah), you're overrated (well alright), you're complicated
This feeling is love

Well I came in the door,yeah I said it before
I never let the stress get me down no more
Giving thanks to the Lord, you know I pray every day
Give shouts to my peeps and this is what we say
And we said

You left us one little room with a black and white TV
One eviction notice and a bill for therapy
You're living all alone you're like a dog without a bone, I said
You're living all alone because you left us all at home
Well you had a second chance but you threw it all away
A fourth, and fifth, and sixth but that was yesterday
Now you're sitting at a bar your just drowning in your tears
You're lonely in the corner while everybody cheers, and we said
