The Click Lyrics
Just because I walk like Obi-Wan Kenobi
You people talk, but you don't even know me
And that's alright, cuz I get down with GC
So I walk on and listen to their cd
Some people laugh, they do it just to spite me
Behind my back, they don't know what I see
But I don't care
What they say
I don't need them anyway
I'll just go about my day
But anyway

You go out on Friday night
I'll stay in but that's alright
Cuz I have found a click to call my own
In crowd, out crowd, I don't care
Your crowd, my crowd, we can't share
Cuz I have found a click to call my own
Let's go!

So come and talk to me
On my computer screen
The best years of our lives aren't as easy as they seem
But one day, we'll look back
And then we'll have to laugh
They used to call us names, now they want our autograph
To get the girl
And make the grade
It's all a show
It's all a game
And I would lose it if I played
It's all the same
So I don't care
What they say
I don't need them anyway
I'll just go about my day
But anyway
You go out on Friday night
I'll stay in but that's alright
Cuz I have found a click to call my own
In crowd, out crowd, I don't care
Your crowd, my crowd, we can't share
Cuz I have found a click to call my own
Let's go!

You go out on Friday night
I'll stay in but that's alright
Cuz I have found a click to call my own
In crowd, out crowd, I don't care
Your crowd, my crowd, we can't share
Cuz I have found a click to call my own
Let's go!
She said she'd call
But I know she won't
She won't
She won'tEmbed
