Little Things Lyrics
Yeah, this song is dedicated (this is Good Charlotte) to every kid who ever got picked last in gym class (y'know what I'm saying, this is for you)
To every kid who never had a date to no school dance (this is for you)
To everyone who's ever been called a freak (y'all know what I'm saying)
This is for you, (what?) here we, here we go
Yeah, what uh, come on
Yeah, what uh, come on, come on
Oh, whoa, come on
Oh, whoa

Like the time in school when we got free lunch and the cool kids beat us up (reduced lunch!)
And the rich kids had convertibles and we had to ride the bus (fifty-five!)
Like the time we made the baseball team, but they still laughed at us (you still suck!)
Like the time that girl broke up with me cause I wasn't cool enough, trick!

Things, things, here we go!

The little things, little things they always hang around
The little things, little things they try to break me down
The little things, little things they just won't go away
The little things, little things made me who I am today, go!
You want to hate me now
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
Yeah, what? Come on. What? Yeah, what?
Here we go

Like the time mom went to that institute cause she was breaking down (I just can't take it!)
Like the car we had that wouldn't start, we had to walk to get around (Can I get a ride?)
And that same year on Christmas Eve, Dad went to the store (uh, I'll see you kids later...)
We checked his room, his things were gone, we didn't see him no more, dick!

Things, things, here we go!

The little things, little things they always hang around
The little things, little things they try to break me down
The little things, little things they just won't go away
The little things, little things made me who I am today, go!
You want to hate me now
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
What! What! What! Here we go...
Little things, little things, little things, little things
Little things, little things, little things, little things
Little things, little things, little things, little things
Little things, little things, little things, here we go!
And it always seems those little things they take the biggest part of me break down, I'm breaking down...
