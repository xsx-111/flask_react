Waldorf Worldwide Lyrics
Worldwide what?
You heard me
Waldorf, Naptown, worldwide. What?
Come on, get up, get up, get up, come on
Yeah, break it break it break it down
Tikki, tikki

Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now
Let's do this one more time
Everything will be alright, alright

Bring it in bring it in what? Bring in... the verse

Listen up cause there ain't nothing funny
I wanna hot girl and a little bit of money
I wanna little house where my band can live
Cause we're tired of moving every other weekend
I wanna go to parties where they got no guns
I wanna rock with my band, I wanna have a little fun
With thugs and punks and any other type
Can sing this song and we'll sing it all night (sing it!)
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now
Let's do this one more time
Everything will be alright alright

All I wanna do is kick the welfare, all I wanna do is get my share
All I wanna do is kick the welfare, all I wanna do is get my share
And I don't wanna run for the president
I just want an honest way to pay my rent
And I'm tired of the man always shutting us down
Tired of my old man cause he's never around
And I'm tired of eating off of other people's plates
And I don't look important, so they're telling me to wait
Police records said they wouldn't exist
I wanna know the meaning of a Christmas list
Said all I wanna do is kick the welfare
All I wanna do is get my share
All I wanna do is make something from nothing
It's GC baby and we're working with something

Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright
Get down stay up all night now
Let's do this one more time
Everything will be alright alright
We'll be self-made millionaires
These lives we'll lead without a care, oh yeah
And we'll see what we'll be

Everything's gonna be alright now
Everybody say oh yeah that's right
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everybody say it one more time
Everything will be alright, alright, alright, alright
(We'll see you when we get there)
(We'll see you when we get there)

Or the radio
In the magazines
On the movie screensEmbed
