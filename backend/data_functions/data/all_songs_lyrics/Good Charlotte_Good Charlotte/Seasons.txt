Seasons Lyrics
Summer air reminds me of all the feelings of your love
And what it was like when we were together. (Oh)
Walking all along a beach, you were never far from my reach
And you held me through stormy weather. (Oh)

And I-- I want to fall in love tonight
And I-- I remember when you said: Everything is gonna be alright

Laying in the summer grass
You told me not to talk so fast as I told you how I feel
You made me feel right at home
You told me I was not alone and you knew just how I feel
I know we talked about it
I just can't get around it
I just want one more night with yo


October air reminds me of all the seasons of your love
And what it was like when we were together (Oh)
The smell of fall is everywhere & though it seems I just don't care
Cause now, you've gone away
