Charlie Freak Lyrics
Charlie Freak had but one thing to call his own
Three weighed ounce pure golden ring, no precious stone
Five nights without a bite, no place to lay his head
And if nobody takes him in he'll soon be dead

On the street he spied my face, I heard him hail
In our plot of frozen space he told his tale
Poor man, he showed his hand, so righteous was his need
And me so wise I bought his prize for chicken feed
Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind
Poor kid, he overdid, embraced the spreading haze
And while he sighed his body died in fifteen ways
When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay
'Round his arm the plastic tag read 'D.O.A'
Yes Jack, I gave it back, the ring I could not own
Now come, my friend, I'll take your hand and lead you homeEmbed
