Eid Ma Clack Shaw Lyrics
Working through death's pain

Last night I swear I felt your touch
Gentle and warm
The hair stood on my arms
How, how, how?

Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
To shake a memory
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
To shake a memory

I flipped my forelock
I twitched my withers
I reared and bucked
I could not put my rider aground
All these fine memories are fucking me down
I dreamed it was a dream that you were gone
I woke up feeling so ripped by reality
Yeah, love is the king of the beasts
And when it gets hungry, it must kill to eat
Yeah, love is the king of the beasts
A lion walking down city streets

I fell back asleep some time later on
And I dreamed the perfect song
It held all the answers like hands laid on
I woke halfway and scribbled it down
And in the morning, what I wrote, I read
It was hard to read at first, but here's what it said:

"Eid ma clack shaw zupoven del ba
Mertepy ven seinur cofally ragdah"
"Eid ma clack shaw zupoven del ba
Mertepy ven seinur cofally ragdah"

Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
To shake a memory
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
To shake a memory
"Eid ma clack shaw zupoven del ba
Mertepy ven seinur cofally ragdah"

Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
To shake a memory
Show me the way
Show me the way
Show me the way
To shake a memory1Embed
