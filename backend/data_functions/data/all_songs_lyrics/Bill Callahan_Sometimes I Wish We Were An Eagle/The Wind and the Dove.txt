The Wind and the Dove LyricsSomewhere between the wind and the dove
Lies all I sought in you
And when the wind just dies
When the wind just dies
And the dove won't rise
From your windowsill
Well I cannot tell you
Which way it would be
If it was not this way too
For the wind and the dove
For the wind and the dove
And I am a child of linger on
I peer through the window gone
I am a child of linger on
I peer through the window gone
Somewhere between the wind and the dove
Lies all I lost in you
And when the wind just dies
When the wind just dies
And the dove won't rise
From your windowsill
Well I cannot tell you
Which way it would be
If it was not this way too
For the wind and the dove
For the wind and the dove
And I am a child of linger on
I peer through the window gone
I am a child of linger on
I peer through the window goneEmbed
