My Friend LyricsI looked all around
It was not written down
And so I'll tell you now
I will always love you
My friend
My friend
Now I'm not saying we're cut from the same tree
But like two pieces of the gallows
The pillar and the beam
Like two pieces of the gallows
We share a common dream
To destroy what will harm other men
My friend
And my friend
And my friend
And my friend
I looked all around
It was not written down
So I'll tell you now
I will always love you
And my friend
And my friend
And my friendEmbed
