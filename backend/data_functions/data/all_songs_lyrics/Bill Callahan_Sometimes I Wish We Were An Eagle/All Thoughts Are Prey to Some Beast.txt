All Thoughts Are Prey to Some Beast LyricsThe leafless tree looked like a brain
The birds within were all the thoughts and desires within me
Hoppin' around from branch to branch
Or snug in their nests listenin' in
An eagle came over the horizon
And shook the branches with its sight
The softer thoughts: starlings, finches, and wrens
The softer thoughts, they all took flight
The eagle looked clear through the brain tree
Empty, he thought, save for me
Maybe I'll make this one my home
Consolidate the nests of the tiny
Raise a family of might like me
Then something struck him, wings of bone
Sweet desires and soft thoughts were all gone
The eagle shrieked, "I'm alone"
Well it was time to flee the tree
The eagle snuck up on the wind
One talon at a time
Being sky king of the sky
What did he have to fear?
All thoughts are prey to some beast
All thoughts are prey to some beast
All thoughts are prey to some beast
All thoughts are prey to some beast
All thoughts are prey to some beast
All thoughts are prey to some beast
Sweet desire and soft thoughts, return to me
Sweet desire and soft thoughts, return to me
Sweet desire and soft thoughts, return to me
Sweet desire and soft thoughts, return to me
Sweet desire and soft thoughts, return to me
Sweet desire and soft thoughts, return to me
Sweet desire and soft thoughts, return to me
Sweet desire and soft thoughts, return to meEmbed
