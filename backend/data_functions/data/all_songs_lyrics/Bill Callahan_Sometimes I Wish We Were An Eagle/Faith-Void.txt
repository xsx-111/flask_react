Faith/Void LyricsIt's time to put God away
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away
Damnin' the children
Makin' the ill just a little more sick
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away, I put God away
It's time to put God away, I put God away
This is the end of faith, no more must I strive
To find my peace, to find my peace in a lie
This is the end of faith, no more must I strive
To find my peace, to find my peace in a lie
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away, I put God away
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away, I put God away
For a void without a question is just perverse
A void without a question is just perverse
Like tear gas misters at my grave
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away, I put God away
It's time to put God away, I put God away
For a void without a question is just perverse
This is the end of faith, no more must I strive
To find my peace, to find my peace in a lie
This is the end of faith, no more must I strive
To find my peace, to find my peace in a lie
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away, I put God away
It's time to put God away
It's time to put God away, I put God away1Embed
