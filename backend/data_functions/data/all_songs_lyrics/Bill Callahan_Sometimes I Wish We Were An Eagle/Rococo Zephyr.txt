Rococo Zephyr LyricsShe lay beside me
Like a branch from a tender willow tree
I was as still, as still as a river could be
When a rococo zephyr (rococo)
Swept over her and me (rococo)
She watched the water ripple ripple ripple ripple light
Light watched the water ripple ripple ripple ripple she
Did some kind of dance, jaunty as a bee
I tried to look my best, a finch in wild mint vest
A fiercer force had wrenched her from where she used to be
I caught and caressed the length of her
A tender willow branch floatin' on me
Well maybe this was all, was all that meant to be
Maybe this is all, is all that meant to be
A rococo zephyr (rococo) crept up
And stepped over her and me (rococo)
Well I used to be sort of blind
Now I can sort of see
Yeah I used to be sort of blind
Now I can sort of seeEmbed
