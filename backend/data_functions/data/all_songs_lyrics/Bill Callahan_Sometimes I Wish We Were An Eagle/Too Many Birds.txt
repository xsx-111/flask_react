Too Many Birds LyricsToo many birds in one tree
Too many birds in one tree
And the sky is full of black and screaming leaves
The sky is full of black and screaming
And one more bird
Then one more bird
And one last bird
And another
One last black bird without a place to land
One last black bird without a place to be
Turns around in hopes to find the place it last knew rest
Oh black bird over black rain burn
This is not where you last knew rest
You fly all night to sleep on stone
The heartless rest that in the morn will be gone
You fly all night to sleep on stone
To return to the tree with too many birds
Too many birds
Too many birds
If
If you
If you could
If you could only
If you could only stop
If you could only stop your
If you could only stop your heart
If you could only stop your heart beat
If you could only stop your heart beat for
If you could only stop your heart beat for one heart
If you could only stop your heart beat for one heart beat4Embed
