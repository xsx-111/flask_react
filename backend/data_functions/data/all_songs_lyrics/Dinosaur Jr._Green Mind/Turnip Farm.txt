Turnip Farm LyricsCome on with me... tell me all about it
Come on with me... tell me all about it
Come on with me and tell me all about it
I needed to feel you there, yeah doubt it
Come on with me... tell me all about it
Come on with me... tell me all about it
Come on with me and tell me all about it
I needed to feel you there, yeah doubt it
Just come on with me... and tell me all about it
Come on with me... tell me all about it
Please don't leave me, not like this
What about all that we'll miss
Done it all and what a waste
I don't want this rage misplaced
Please don't leave me, not just yet
Cause it's brutal, can't forget
Nothing else we could have done
Still it's killing me you're gone...
Come on with me and tell me all about it
I needed to feel you there, yeah doubt it
Come on with me and tell me all about it
I needed to feel you there, never doubt it
Just come on with me... tell me all about it
Come on with me... tell me all about it
Come on...
Come on...Embed
