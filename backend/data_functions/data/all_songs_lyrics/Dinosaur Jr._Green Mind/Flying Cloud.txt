Flying Cloud LyricsThings happen and no one told me
You can't think, you can't drink it
You laughed again then you rode me
I won't drop it, you can't stop it now
Hey lady, where you going?
Hey lady, why arenâ€™t it snowing?
Were you riding the chair alone?
Hey lady, where's your friend?
Hey lady, blew you off again
Don't worry, I'll ride you up to the top
Hey lady, sorry, that's the last stop
I'll see you I'll see you
All the way down
I'll see you
In the large flying cloud
I'll see you
I'll see you
All the way down
In the large flying cloudEmbed
