Forget It LyricsTold you, for the last time
Don't say you haven't heard
I Don't see how you could run through this again
I Don't have another word
Dreams are not my biggest asset
But I thought your plans cool
Guess you backed out of the habit
Who did I think I could fool
Doesn't come up very often
Wish If seem the same for you
I placed it by the door
I thought you'd seen it on the floor
Guess to me it's something more
'Cause more I think about it
I don't want to doubt it
She's still beaming my way
And I just crumble, what can I say?
Doesn't come up very often
I Wish It seemed the same for you
And all the times before
I thought you'd deal
That's not the score
Are your prepared for whats in store?
Come on, come on
You know I want to see you
But I can only take so many hurts
Are you the one I cannot...?2Embed
