Water Lyrics
I saw you down across the water
You're floating safely in the way you do
Then I scrammed before you saw me
I've got to keep thinking you wanted to
By the shoreline, will you be fine?
Or will it cover you?
And when you taste it, will you embrace it?
What will you let it do to you?
Grab a look across the water
We grab a smile and then you're gone a while
With you it'd be across the water
When I'm losing it I like your style
By the shoreline, will you be fine?
Or will it cover you?
And when you taste it, will you embrace it?
What will you let it do to you?

Come on, baby
Drive me out of mind
Mind if I come home, along with you
And see what you do
This is crazy
And nothing more I want to
See
The sea is not the safest place to sit
And be so spacy
Scary things across the water
You'd never know
Till they have their way with you
You won't catch me dip in the water
However much I want to play with you

Don't stay in long
No one's that strong
Enough, not to crumble
Whenever the water wants you
Don't be so crazed
I'm just trying to save
You from losing everything you've got
This is no time to rot
Don't be fooled by
All the coolness rushing by
Don't let it grab your mind
Pull out now or you will find
All you strive for
Nothing, gone, no more
You're his servant nowEmbed
