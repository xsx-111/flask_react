Muck Lyrics
I know these things have passed you by
I know it's tough to even try
It's such a different kind of scene
I know you don't know what I mean
Yeah well, I tried to tell you before
I know all you want is more
I'll always tell you different stuff
No matter what won't be enough
I figure it'll be cool sometime
After I've cooked everyone I find
I can only take it to that certain place
It's just not cool, look at your face
Whenever you get in my face
There's something strange I start to taste

Hold back, hold back, hold back
Hold back, hold back, hold back

It's all restrained, I'm getting baked
Is it okay, or am I a flake?
So, every time you see me now
You psyche for a minute
'til you remember how
I clogged your entire mind with muck
You stop smiling, remember how everything sucked
Dancing around what I could say
'cause I just can't live that way
Hold back, that's not enough to stay

Hold back, hold back
Hold back, hold back, hold back
Hold back, hold back, hold back
Hold back, hold back, hold backEmbed
