Blowing It Lyrics
I been thinking through the night
Everybody's so uptight
People hurt and that's their right
Cut 'em all loose, think I might
Stewing, hanging out in town
And my head whirling around
Don't trust your mind, it'll let you down
Don't have a thing to go on

I don't know a thing to say to you
I don't know a thing to say to you

There's a time and there's a place
It's not now, it's time to pace
Things I'd say but just can't face
All it means to say them
I could believe the things I feel
Then tomorrow, is it the same deal?
Am I acting on something real?
Or am I blowing it again?

I don't know a thing to say to you
I don't know a thing to say to you
I don't know a thing to say to you
I don't know a thing to say to you1Embed
