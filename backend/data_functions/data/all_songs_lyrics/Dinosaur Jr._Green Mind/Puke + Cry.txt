Puke + Cry Lyrics
Try and believe, I thought I'd show you
The way tomorrow, please just peek at the ground
I been aching just to go to
Wherever your head's at just please bring it down
Things I'd like to show you
'Cause you don't even know you
Do you, girl?
I need to feel your angle
'Cause things don't want to mangle
Answer me, girl
Take your pick, you pick the bark off
Stopped you and we need you back to turn things around
Things above and it's not far off
That everyone will puke and cry, please come down

Come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down

Things I'd like to show you
'Cause you don't even know you
Do you, girl?
You sift through all your feelings
Not the one who's feeling
It all, girl
It's creeping over your palm
Now can you keep it that calm
Time to wake, girl
I need to feel your angle
'Cause things don't want to mangle
Answer me, girl
Don't do it, give in this time
Because without it things will start going down
I try to stop you 'cause I know why
You been smiling lately
Dancing around

Come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down

There's things I'd like to show you
'Cause you don't even know you
Do you, girl?
There's things you got to do here
Each little thing too near
Let them go, girl
You sift through all your feelings
You're not the one who's feeling
It all, girl
It's all so big and twisted
Please come help me fix it
Snap out of it, girl
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on down, come on down, come on down
Come on downEmbed
