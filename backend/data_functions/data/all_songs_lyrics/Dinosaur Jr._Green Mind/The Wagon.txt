The Wagon Lyrics
There's a way I feel right now
Wish you'd help me, don't know how
We're all nuts, so who helps who?
Some help when no one's got a clue

Baby, why don't we?
Baby, why don't we?

There's a place I'd like to go
When you get there, then I'll know
There's a place I know you've been
Here's a wagon, get on in

Baby, why don't we?
Baby, why don't we?

Baby, why don't we?
Baby, why don't we?
Why don't we?

You won't see me
You won't see me
There you are, and here I stand
Trying to make you feel my hand

You won't see me
You won't see me
I ring the doorbell in your mind
But it's locked from the outside

You won't see me
You won't see me
You don't live there anyway
But I knock on it all day

You won't see me
You won't see me

There's a place I go
But you're not there
And I'm supposed to know
How to get to where
You're going to be
But you don't even know
So I'm flaking while you're shaking it
With every stone you fly
Without a mind, without a spine
What is it that you want to find?
There's a place I go
But you're not there
And I'm supposed to know
How to get to where
You're going to be
But you don't even know
So I'm flailing while you're sailing off
Without a course in mind
Without a mind, without a dock
What is it that you want to find?
There's a place I'd like to go
When you get there, then I'll know
There's a place I know you've been
Here's a wagon, get on in

Baby, why don't we?
Baby, why don't we?
Why don't we?

You won't see me
You won't see me
There you are, and here I stand
Trying' to make you feel my hand
You won't see me
You won't see me
I ring the doorbell in your mind
But it's locked from the outside

You won't see me
You won't see me
You don't live there anyway
But I knock on it all day

You won't see me
You won't see me1Embed
