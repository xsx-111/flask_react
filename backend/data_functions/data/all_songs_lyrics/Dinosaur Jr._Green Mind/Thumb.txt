Thumb Lyrics
There never really is a good time
There's always nothing much to say
Pretty good, not doing that fine
Getting up most every day

Stepping out, I tried to fix it
Pulled a thumb out of that hole
Give me ingredients, I'll mix it
How can you move without a goal

There never really is a good time
There's always nothing much to say
Pretty good, not doing that fine
Getting up most every day

An excuse is all you're in for
The abuse is all you crave
Sure you know just what is in store
Wait and see if I'll behave

There never really is a good time
There's always nothing much to say
Pretty good, not doing that fine
Getting up most every day
There's a time, just let me know now
When it's with you I'll be glad
That I was right there just to show you
At least it's more than what you had

There never really is a good timeEmbed
