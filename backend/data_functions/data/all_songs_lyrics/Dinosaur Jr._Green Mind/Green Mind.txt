Green Mind Lyrics
How you doing
I picture things a certain way
Then go back to it another day
The green mind said it’s okay
Because you know where they’re going to be
All’s you have to do is come with me
It’s cool, they’re probably asleep
On the outside, that’s where they always hide
Come to my side and I’ll introduce you to
Some of their kind, I know you’ve always tried
And now it’s your time to take in their point of view
It’s nothing new

I've been bouncing off the walls
I can’t hang with them for long
They’re cool, but I need you
On a certain level I think they’re great
But on another I can’t relate
To anything they do

On the outside
Might be with them tonight
Unless you decide to call, then I’ll check out you
Hanging heavy’s such a routine
I’ve just begun to forget why
I seldom try to break out of their scene
And now I got to work on you
So the frogs will hang and they’ll always be hanging
Now we’re here, what do we do
I’ve been sorting through the pros
And cons of your eyes, they’re webbed toes
Can’t you help move it along
I been picking through my thoughts
It’s a shame my judgment rots
And I sure feel where I belong

On the outside
Well it’ll be a while
I got to un fry ’fore I pick it up with you
Do I need that stable care
Don’t I know that they’ll be there
Does that cut now you’ve appeared
Or do I need that stable core
Or do I jump for something more
Are you all that I fear

I've been picking through my thoughts
It’s a shame my judgment rots
And I sure go where I belong
It’s a call that’s tough to make
It could be a big mistake
Can’t you help move it along
If I keep stewing ’bout how I feel
Eventually you'll split, then I won’t have to deal
Sounds like a plan
But it’s kind of lame to let it slide
Knowing either way I haven’t tried
Can’t figure out where it all stands
In the green mindEmbed
