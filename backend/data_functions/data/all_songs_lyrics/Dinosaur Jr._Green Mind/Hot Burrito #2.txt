Hot Burrito #2 LyricsYes you loved me
And you stole my clothes
I love you
But that's the way that it goes
So it goes
Guess you know how I feel
So it goes
You just couldn't be real
We know it's strong
And I don't think it's gonna go on
When I come home
I'm carrying my shoes
I've been waiting
To tell you some news
And you won't be home all night
You don't want another fight
But you better love
Find some love
You better love me
It's not tonight
Yes you loved me
And you stole my clothes
I love you baby
But that's the way that it goes
So it goes
Yes, you know how I feel
So it goes
Couldn't be realEmbed
