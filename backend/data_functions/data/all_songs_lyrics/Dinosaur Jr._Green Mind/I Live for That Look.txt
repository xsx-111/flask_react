I Live for That Look Lyrics
Hey, I live for that look
Hey, is that all it took?
I know why, I know why
Hey, it's all on your head
Hey, is that what you said?
I know why, I know why

You run around
And you won't see tomorrow
See today, no way
Time to pay
Up for not having a time to even say

Hey, it's going no place
Hey, don't give me that face
I know why, I know why
Hey, be better this time
Hey, get out of my mind
I know why, I know why

You run around
And you won't see tomorrow
See today, no way
Time to pay
Up for not having a single thing to say
Tell me now, tell me nowEmbed
