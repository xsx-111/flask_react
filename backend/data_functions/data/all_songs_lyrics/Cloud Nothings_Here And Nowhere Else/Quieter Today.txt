Quieter Today Lyrics
I think I know you lie
I know a thousand times
We must be hiding this so I'll still see you
There's nothing wrong with trust
I just don't have enough
I can't tell myself that love is real

Every time I feel okay my heart moves forward
Thinking I'll go on today and I can't turn it
Every time I feel okay my head moves forward
Figure I'll move on today and I can't turn it

No one wants to hear everyone complain
Even if it's holding me insane
No one listens, no one hears it
Say what you want but I'm not gonna hear it
But keep it quieter today

I think I know you lie
I checked a thousand times
You must be hiding it so I’ll still see you
There’s nothing wrong with drugs
I just don’t have enough
I can't tell myself that nothing's real
Every time I feel okay my head moves forward
Thinking I'll go on today and I can't turn it
Every time I feel okay my head moves forward
Figure I'll move on today and I get started

No one wants to hear everyone complain
Maybe if it's holding me insane
No one hears it, no one needs it
Say what you want but I'm not gonna hear it
To keep it quieter today

Try to keep it quieter today
Try to keep it quieter todayEmbed
