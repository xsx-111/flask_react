Now Hear In Lyrics
I go outside and see all these things that should be real
Come on, you're a part of it, can you breathe or can you feel?
You're not the same as me but I know we share a thing
No use remembering how it used to be so real

I can feel your pain, and I feel alright 'bout it
I can feel your pain, and I feel alright 'bout it
I can feel your pain, and I feel alright 'bout it
I can feel your pain, and I feel alright 'bout it
We're moving quickly to the same (Now hear in)
I feel there's nothing left to say (Now hear in)
A simple life could be so strange (Now hear in)
If we’re just living here today (Now hear in)

I go outside and see all these things that should be real
Come on, you're a part of it, can you breathe or can you feel?
You're not the same as me but I know we share a thing
No use remembering how it used to be so real

And I can feel your pain, and I feel alright 'bout it
I can feel your pain, and I feel alright 'bout it
I can feel your pain, and I feel alright 'bout it
I can feel your pain, and I feel alright 'bout it
We're moving quickly to the same (Now hear in)
I feel there's nothing left to say (Now hear in)
A simple life could be so strange (Now hear in)
If we’re just living here today (Now hear in)
You know there's nothing left to say (Now hear in)
You know there's nothing left to say
You know there's nothing left to say (Now hear in)
You know there's nothing left to say1Embed
