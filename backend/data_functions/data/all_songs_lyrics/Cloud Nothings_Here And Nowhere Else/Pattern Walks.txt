Pattern Walks Lyrics
There's something wrong here, nothing in the air is moving
I feel a chill and try to keep my body walking
Another person looks like he is right behind me
I'm moving forward while I keep the past around me

Pattern walks, pattern walks
Pattern walks in the moon tonight and
Pattern walks, pattern walks
Pattern walks in the moon tonight and

I'm slow at times, that leaves its face for no improvement
A little piece of a lie to keep it there and moving
Another person has to be just right behind me
I'm moving forward while I keep the past around me


Pattern walks, pattern walks
Pattern walks, pattern walks
Pattern walks, pattern walks
Pattern walks, pattern walks and
I don't feel bored or worried, I just feel strange
Coming up the middle of the thought that I could change
I don't feel bored or worried, I just feel strange
Coming up the middle of the thought that I could change


I thought, I thought
I thought I never would remember, would remember
I thought, I thought
I thought I never would remember, would remember
 (x8)
I thought, I thought
I thought, I thought
I thought, I thought
I thought, I thought2Embed
