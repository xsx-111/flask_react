No Thoughts Lyrics
It's hard to love in a generation
Though it's all planned out
It's hard to hear what you're trying to say
When words are far too loud
New creeps gonna rule the nation
I don't like that sound
Can try but nothing changes
Do you agree with me now

And you don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it now

It's hard to love in a generation
Though it's all planned out
It's hard to hear what you're trying to say
When words are far too loud
New creeps gonna rule the nation
I don't like that sound
Can try but nothing changes
Do you agree with me now
And you don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it now

You're born, you're gone
You're born, you're gone
You're born, you're gone
You're born, you're gone

And you don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it
You don't really seem to care
And I don't even talk about it nowEmbed
