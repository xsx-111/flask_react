Just See Fear Lyrics
Rearrange another part of me
There's nothing you can do to me no
Look inside and know the perfect time
There's always something there to make 

I'm not going to move forward
I don't want you here
I need a reason, I don't hear it
Now I just see fear
I don't hear it
Now I'm just so

Words you said always sound the same
I need a little time to take alone
Look inside and know the perfect time
There's always something there to make it
