House for Everyone Lyrics{Intro}
My bed is made of candy floss, the house is made of cheese
It's lit by lots of glow-worms; if I'm wrong correct me please
The village is a pop-up book, the people wooden dolls
The roads are made of treacle, think it's time that I moved on
Chorus:
My home is half a walnut shell, the journey will be long
So I filled the whole with peppermints and creamy pink blanc-mange
I sailed away for fifteen days, it never once got dark
And came upon two large houses set out in a park
Verse:
On the door of one was truth, on the other door was lies
Which one should I enter thru? I really must decide
The door of lies had lots of flowers growing round outside
But looking close I noticed it was crumbling inside
Verse:
The door of truth was very plain, but stood up very strong
And when I entered thru it's door I knew I wasn't wrongEmbed
