Hope I Never Find Me There Lyrics(Dave Mason)
Seems that I had just to stay
The birds have flown, the sky's turned gray
The bees have ruffled by the flowers
Plastic plants that never die and I
Hope they never find me here
I walked upon synthetic grass where little people said
"Don't ask about the field where you once played
Atomic Factories have replaced" and I
Hope they never find me here
The horse I ride has lost a shoe, the buttercups are dry
The car I drive has broken down and the blacksmith trade is dying
Meals I eat have changed into a concentrated vacuum
The air has come to be as one
Time to leave has just begun
The world is waiting it's a fact
To stage the last and final act and
Hope I never find me there
There
There....Embed
