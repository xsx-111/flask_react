Date with IKEA Lyrics
The actress is always breaking things
The things you made and she took you for
And I'm so tired I'd be lying
I hope the prairie buys you more

The fitness coast is growing near
The shores they don't stay blond this year
That's why the marble lawns stay clear
And warm in time

I want to stay but my time is wasting
The magic lands call my name
They want to fire a missile launcher
But I know I need to stay

We all know that by staying here
It'll be a good high this year
So what's the use to staying there
If you've got no use for time

The fitness coast is growing near
The shores they don't stay blond all year
The continent moves with growing fears
It's all for expensive lawn

I know I need to stay and fight the day Embed
