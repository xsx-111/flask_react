Blue Hawaiian Lyrics
A welcome to my friends
This house is a home and a home's where I belong
Where the feelings are warm and the foundations are strong
If my soul has a shape, well, then it is an ellipse
And this slap is a gift

'Cause your cheeks have lost their luster
You know, your cheeks have lost their luster
You know, your cheeks have lost their luster
You know, your cheeks have lost their luster, luster, luster, luster
Take it back

Send return out of time
Tape machine needs to be aligned

Aloha means goodbye, and also hello; it's in how you inflect
Put the bark in the dog and you've got a guardian
When the capital's S, it is followed by a T; and it's probably me

And the tones are grouped in clusters
You know, the tones are grouped in clusters
Well, the tones are grouped in clusters
You know the tones are grouped in clusters, clusters, clusters, clusters
Take it back
Kiss me into the past
Lately never gonna last1Embed
