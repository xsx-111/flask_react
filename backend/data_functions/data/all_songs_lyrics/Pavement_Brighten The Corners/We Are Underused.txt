We Are Underused Lyrics
Out beyond the call of duty
Hold your instincts hostage and stick near me
Let's drink a toast
It's the most I can stand to cry
About the mental energy you wasted on this wedding invitation
Let's thank the host
You've been such a great host
The roast was just so perfectly prepared

Now I know you care
Now I know you care
We are underused
We are underused

Simply put, I want to grow old
Dying does not meet my expectations
Let's drink a toast to all those who arrived alive
To tell about their struggles in hushed tones around a fire
It's late winter
Let's sink the ship
Mix our blood, just the tip
A crip is sleeping on the basement stairs
Oh, I know he's there
Oh, I know he's there
We are underused
We are underused, yeah

We are underused
We are underused
We are underused
We are underused

We are under, under, under, under, underused!
We are under, under, under, under, underused!Embed
