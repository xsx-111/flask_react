Passat Dream Lyrics
You know you've got it all wrong
There's no other way to find it
You know you gotta be strong
And I really hope you plan to buy it

Cause that's the way to Passat, babe
And that's the car to his soul
He will bring you all the millions in gold, child
If you will only let him have his role

Everybody wishes you'd gone
I've got no time to find it
And the dealer with the jingly song will never
Match my price reduction

Cause that's the way to Passat, babe
And that's the car to his soul
He will bring you all the millions in gold
If you will only let him have his role

Yeah, you gotta be strong
There's no other way to fund it
All the plantings are young and able
And I hope you find a way to buy it
Cause that's the way to his heart, babe
And that's the way to his soul
You got to give him millions in gold, child
Before I go the way of the sold
Cause that's the way to his heart, babe
And that's the way to his soul
You got to give him millions in gold, child
Before I go the way of the soldEmbed
