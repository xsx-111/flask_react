Embassy Row Lyrics
Old intuition on your dock we're fishin'
Come on now, give us a grade
A for effort and a B for delivery
C for devotion when the world starts encroaching on your plans
Where is the savoir? Where is the savoir?
He's not here right now
Where is the savoir? Where is the savoir-faire?

Embassy row, the fumes they lay low
On lanes that are wide where the limousines glide
On the wrought-iron gates and the bone china plates
And don't forget your manners where the anthems play

In a netherworld of foreign feeds
In a netherworld of foreign feeds
In a netherworld of foreign feeds
I'm gonna take the crown, I'm gonna take the crown
I'm gonna take the crown, I'm gonna take a crown

Maids, they are frisked and asses are kissed
I needed a visa, I bought off a geezer
Political favors could make you a savior
In an open corner where the news is late

I need to get born, I need to get dead
I'm sick of the forms, I'm sick of being misread
By men in dashikis and their leftist weeklies
Colonized wrath, their shining new path
The converted castle of moorish design
If you want to stay the weekend, well, we wouldn't mind
The plots they are hatching, the surface is scratching
In the open corner where the news is late

In a netherland of foreign beads
In a netherland of foreign beads
In a netherland of foreign beads
I'm gonna take you down, I'm gonna take the crown
I'm gonna take the crown, I'm gonna take a crown
I'm gonna take the crown, I'm gonna take the crown
I'm gonna take the crown, I'm gonna take a crownEmbed
