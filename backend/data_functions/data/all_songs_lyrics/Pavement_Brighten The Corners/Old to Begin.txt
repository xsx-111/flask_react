Old to Begin Lyrics
Embrace the senile genius
Watch him reinvent the wheel
I don't need your summary acts
Summary acts to give into the narrative age

Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, set you
Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, set you

You get to feeling like a fixture
Set in 1966
Time came that we drifted apart
Drifted apart; find an unidentical twin

Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, set you
Old to begin
I will set you back, set you back, fella

Searching for latent cause
Blame it on menopause
Or perhaps stress and strain
Credit cards, lumbar pain
But I've seen your double dares
Everything extraordinaire
I know the things you do are gonna come back1Embed
