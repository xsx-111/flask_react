Nicki LyricsI don't make friends easily or naturally
You can blame chemicals or you can blame patriarchy
It's nothing against you I'm sure you're sweet and pretty
But it's going to take a lot for me to want to leave my mental city
I built it all up around me
I built it all up around me
Instigating, syncopating ask me why so aggravating
Venture a guess you hinge your success on that which you might bleed from me
I've heard it before, I can say for sure, yes
I'm certain that you will agree
No, not me
No, not me
Keep your copper keep your pearls I'm the stubbornest girl in the world
You'll never drive a harder bargain than me
Yes, it's true, I want more
I want more and more and more
Got more appetite than a bear or a forest full of mouths to feed
So save your paltry dowry
I'm gonna buy you before you buy me
Keep your copper keep your pearls I'm the stubbornest girl in the world
You'll never drive a harder bargain than me
No, not me
No
Not meEmbed
