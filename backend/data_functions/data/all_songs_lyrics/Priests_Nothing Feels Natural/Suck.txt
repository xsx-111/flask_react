Suck Lyrics
Why do I always have to be the police to get you to shut up when I speak
Always want someone to call the cops but I can tell you myself that you just suck

Please don't make me be
Please don't make me be
Someone with no sympathy
Someone with no sympathy

How can you tell that I always mean to be mean when you're not even listening
Always want someone to be your mom but I can tell you that I won't hang around long for that
You know I got your back but not your wrongs

Please don't make me be
Please don't make me be
Someone with no sympathy
Someone with no sympathy

Why do I always have to be the police to get you to shut up when I speak
Always want someone to call the cops but I can tell you myself that you just suck

I was walking down the street, lady said to me, "it's always white boys like you obsessed with the police."
