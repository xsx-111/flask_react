Lelia 20 LyricsIn my worst dreams
Gulf flames of passage
In my worst dreams
You are alone, I said
You are alone, I said
The space engulfs your head
People are born and dying inside of me all the time
Tomorrow's going to be a different life
The tower over me it said, oh oh oh
Trust me, trust me
Things could be much, much, much worse
You are a common thief in my worst dreams
You are a common thief
You're still using brawn to get the best of me
But, but, but
I will, I will, I will, I will
Will you into me
I will will you into me
I will eat the shell spit out the seeds I will
I will I will will you into me I willEmbed
