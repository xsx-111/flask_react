Puff LyricsMy best friend says "I want to start a band called Burger King" and I say "Do it,"
Make your dreams a reality
Achieve your dreams Burger King
Achieve your dreams Burger King
Achieve your dreams Burger King
And Munayyer says Netanyahu's actually the best thing
Cause so much hate can only mean we're accelerating
ACCEPT THE TRIUMPH OF THE MACHINE
ACCEPT THE TRIUMPH OF THE MACHINE
ACCEPT THE TRIUMPH OF THE MACHINE
I'm reading about ten blogs on personal growth through abject servility
Launch a crusade. Revolution through aggressive hospitality!
HOSPITALITY!
Launch a crusade. Revolution through aggressive hospitality
In the seventies, strange stars appeared in the sky heralding unforetold plagues
Any colorless technician can pull the knob, touch the right thing
But I don't think you care about anything
Why would you applaud such uninteresting social climbing even the emperor's new clothes made a sceneEmbed
