Pink White House LyricsAnything you want, anyone you want, anywhere you want, anyway anyway
Anything you want, anyone you want, anywhere you want, anyway anyway
Anyway anyway
Magical psychology, deceptive anthropology
All the wing nuts got a haircut, bred and had babies
Bred and had babies
Anything you want, anyone you want, anywhere you want, anyway anyway
Anything you want, anyone you want, anywhere you want, anyway anyway
Anything you want, anyone you want
A puppet show in which you’re made to feel like you participate
Sign a letter, throw your shoe, vote for numbers 1 or 2
Consider the options of a binary
Consider the options of a binary
Consider the options of a binary
Consider the options of a binary
Come on palm trees, come on soft seas, come on vacation, come on SUV
Oooh baby my American dream oooh baby my American dream
Come on sitcom, come on streaming, come on nostalgia, nineties TV
Oooh baby my American dream oooh baby my American dream
Come on nothing, come on surface meaning, come on cash grab, safety masturbating
Oooh baby my American dream oooh baby my American dream
“I am not done fundraising, I am anticipating, appreciation, new age painting”
It’s common disease, It’s a common disease
Lap dog or tease, lap dog or tease
It’s a common disease, Lap dog or tease
Lap dog or tease, so
Kneel at the feet of programming, I’m really not concerned with what you think
You are just a cog in the machine and I am a wet dream soft and mean
Thick line steam, slick and mean
You’re too pitiful to be obscene, too cowardly to be embarrassing
Reinforcing everything killing all that bleed, so
So, so, so
So, swear it on the leaves
Swear it on the leaves, swear it on the leaves
Swear it on the leaves, swear it on the leaves
Swear it on the leaves, swear it on the leaves
Swear it on the leaves, swear it on the leaves
Swear it on the leaves
Anything you want, anyone you want, anywhere you want, anyway anyway
Anything you want, anyone you want, anywhere you want, anyway anyway
AnywayEmbed
