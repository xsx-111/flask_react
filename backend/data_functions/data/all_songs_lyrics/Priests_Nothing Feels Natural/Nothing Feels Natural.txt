Nothing Feels Natural Lyrics
Perhaps I will change into something
Swing wildly the other way
If I go without for days will I finally hallucinate a real thing

No it's not for anyone and I can't wait until it's done and
No it's not for anyone and I can't wait until it's done

Come on, please
Work for something
If I walk a hundred days does it mean
I get to say you can't talk to me
That way, that way, that way
That way, that way, that way
That way, that way, that way

No it's not for anyone and I can't wait until it's done and
No it's not for anyone and I can't wait until it's done
No it's not for anyone and I can't wait until it's done and
No it's not for anyone and I can't wait until it's done

This is when I'd give a god a name
But to people in sanctuaries all I can say is
You will not be saved
You will not, you will not be
No it's not for anyone and I can't wait until it's done and
No it's not for anyone and I can't wait until it's done and
No it's not for anyone and
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait

I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't wait
I can't waitEmbed
