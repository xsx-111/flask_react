JJ LyricsWhen I met you you were just a bad attitude
You dated a model one time she stuck her finger in a light socket
About things like that people were always so mean and rude
But I always felt like, "Oh Veronika, baby, I think I
Kinda know what you mean"
I can't believe I've always had such awful taste
You were just a rich kid low life in a very big jacket in a very big way
The most interesting things about you
Was that you smoked Parliaments, the babiest cigarettes
I thought I was a cowboy because I
Smoked Reds, smoked Reds, smoked reds, smoked reds
I thought I was a cowboy 'cause I
Smoked Reds, smoked reds, smoked reds, smoked reds, smoked reds
You thought I was disgusting
You thought I was disgusting
All the jock frat boys called you a hipster fag
And I think you liked it, I think you loved it
I think you loved it
I wrote a bunch of songs for you
I wrote a bunch of songs for you
But you never knew and you
Never deserved them
Who ever deserves anything anyway
What a stupid concept
What a stupid concept
What a stupid concept
What a stupid concept
