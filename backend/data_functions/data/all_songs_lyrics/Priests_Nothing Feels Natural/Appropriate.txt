Appropriate LyricsYou want some new brutalism?
You want something you can write home about
You want something to move away for
A reason to colonize
New hope in the great unwashed
Say it
"I've tasted maggots, I ate bugs
I've tasted maggot, I ate bugs"
Is George Clinton the kinda story your adventure's looking for?
Feels good to buy something you can't afford
It feels good to buy something you can't afford
It feels good to buy something you can't afford
It feels good to buy something you can't afford
It's a long movie
A long movie and you are not you
You are not you
You are not you
You are not you
Contestant, contestant
You're on Wheel of Fortune
You're on Wheel of Fortune
You're on Wheel of Fortune
You're on Wheel of Fortune
I worked too hard to have friends like you anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
So don't ask me for an elevator speech
You and me both know about dishonesty
So don't ask me for1Embed
