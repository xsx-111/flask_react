Roller Coaster (Mono LP Version) Lyrics
Once, somewhere, sometime ago
His eyes were clear to see
He put his thoughts into my mind
And gave my self to be
He stopped me from living so un-sane
I could be just what I wanna be
Things appear as they really are
I can see just what I wanted to see

Come on
And let it happen to you
I say, I say come on
And let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind and let everything come through
Come on, yeah

Well, it starts like a rollercoaster ride
So real, it takes your breath away
It slides you through your point of view
You look back to where you thought you'd stayed
Your ride changes outside view
While it glides you like a neon ray
And you find you don't have to search for words
For there's nothing to be said
Come on
You gotta let it happen to you
Hey, come on
And let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind and let everything come through


After you trip, life opens up
You start doing what you want to do
And you find out that the world that you once feared
Gets what it has from you
No one can ever hurt you
But you know more than you thought you knew
And you're looking at the world with brand new eyes
And no one can ever spoil the view

Come on
And let it happen to you
Hey, hey, hey come on
And let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind and let everything come through
Open up your mind, let everything come throughEmbed
