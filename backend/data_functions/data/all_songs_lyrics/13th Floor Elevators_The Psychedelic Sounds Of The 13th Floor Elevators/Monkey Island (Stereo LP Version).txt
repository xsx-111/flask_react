Monkey Island (Stereo LP Version) Lyrics
We're living on monkey island, baby
We're right in the middle of a zoo
We're living on monkey island, baby
Pretend to be a monkey too

Well, here I am on monkey island
Hiding behind a rock
I'm all dressed up in my monkey suit
Pretending to be something I'm not

We're living on monkey island, baby
We're right in the middle of a zoo
Living on monkey island, baby
Pretend to be a monkey too

Well, there's one thing about thеse monkeys, baby
They don't know I'm around
But, uh, that's prеtty good, 'cause if they knew
They'd probably come and put me down

With my paisley tie and my one-button suit
Is about as close as I can get
'Cause I guess that I must be doing okay
'Cause they haven't come and got me yet
Living on monkey island, baby
We're right in the middle of a zoo
Living on monkey island, baby
Pretending to be a monkey too
Pretending to be a monkey too
Pretending to be a monkeyEmbed
