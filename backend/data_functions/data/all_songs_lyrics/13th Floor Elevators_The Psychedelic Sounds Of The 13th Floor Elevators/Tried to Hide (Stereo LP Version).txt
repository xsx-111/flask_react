Tried to Hide (Stereo LP Version) Lyrics
You think that you're strong when you're only straining
You think that you have when you're only claiming
When I got near
All I saw was fear

And I know that you tried to hide
And you cried 'cause you lied about it

You knew what you had when you tried to tell it
You thought what you were and you tried to sell it
And when I got near
All I saw was fear

And I know that you tried to hide
And you cried 'cause you lied about it
Woah, yeah

You use the words, but you're only guessing
And you know I saw it was your window dressing
Well, you know the song
But you live it all wrong
And I know that you tried to hide
And you cried 'cause you lied about it
Woah, yeah

I know you tried to hide
I know you tried to hide
Tried to hide
Tried to hide
Tried to hideEmbed
