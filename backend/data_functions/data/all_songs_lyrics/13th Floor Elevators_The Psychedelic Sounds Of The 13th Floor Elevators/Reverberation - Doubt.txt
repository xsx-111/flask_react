Reverberation - Doubt Lyrics
Well, you finally find your helpless mind is trapped inside your skin
You want to leave, but you believe you won't get back again
You only know you have to go
But still you can't get out
You try and try, you die and die
You're stopped by your own doubt

Reverberation, reverberation
You find no peace, it doesn't cease
It's deadly irritation
It keeps you blind, it's there behind
Its every hesitation
It holds your thought, your mind is caught
You're fixed with fascination
You think you'll die, it's just a lie
It's backward elevation

Reverberation, reverberation
You see reverberation
In your latest incarnation
You think it's a sensation
But it's just reverberation
You start to swerve the downward curve that catches up your fears
Each thing you do comes home to you and pounds inside your ears
You start to fight against the night that screams inside your mind
When something black, it answers back
And grabs you from behind

Reverberation (Echoing through your brain)
Reverberation (Driving your mind insane)
Reverberation (Causing your blood to drain)
Leaving just charred remainsEmbed
