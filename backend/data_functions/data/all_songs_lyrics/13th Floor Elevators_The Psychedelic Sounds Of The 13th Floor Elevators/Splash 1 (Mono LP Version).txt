Splash 1 (Mono LP Version) Lyrics
I've seen your face before, I've known you all my life
And though it's new, your image cuts me like a knife

And now I'm home
And now I'm home
And now I'm home to stay

The neon from your eyes is splashing into mine
They're so familiar in a way I can't define

And now I'm home
And now I'm home
And now I'm home to stay

Though this is awful speedy
We needn't bother sleeping
All we might say is understood


And now I'm home
And now I'm home
And now I'm home to stay
The fierceness of my feelings rocks me like a war
It's good to know we won't be strangers anymore

And now I'm home
And now I'm home
And now I'm home to stay
And now I'm home
And now I'm home
And now I'm home to stayEmbed
