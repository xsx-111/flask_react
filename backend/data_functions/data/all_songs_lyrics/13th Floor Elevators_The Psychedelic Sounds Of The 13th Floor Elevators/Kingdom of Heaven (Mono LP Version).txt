Kingdom of Heaven (Mono LP Version) LyricsHere you are at my place within your glistening eyes
I'm watching your reactions as the thing within you cries
And I'm bringing you this message 'cause I think it's time you knew
That the kingdom of heaven is within you
The incense and the candles and the colors on the wall
Your image stands reflected as a princess come to call
Your suspicions I'm confirming as you find them all quite true
And the kingdom of heaven is within you
(Yeah)
Through the stained glass windows, moonlight flashes on the choir
And splashеs on the altar in glows of liquid fire
Then it bathеs you with its glory and you begin life anew
And the kingdom of heaven is within youEmbed
