Fire Engine (Mono LP Version) Lyrics
Hey

Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine
Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine
It can drive you out of your mind
Climb the ladder of your own design in my fire engine

Don't you tell it to go slow or stop
You've got to work it right up to the top
A piercing bolt of neon red
Explodes on fire inside your head

Let me take you to the empty place in my firе engine
Let mе take you to the empty place in my fire engine
Boiling rhythms making your ears ring
Rounding the corner, you can feel the ring of my fire engine

Close your eyes and you erase
Your image you no longer chase
A fiery flood engulfs your brain
And drowns your thoughts with scarlet rain
Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine
Let me take you to the empty place in my fire engine
It can drive you out of your mind
Climb the ladder of your own design in my fire engineEmbed
