Your Hands LyricsAnatano te, konnani kireina
Anatano te, yumenimade miru
Your hands, so beautiful
Your hands, I even dream about them
Anatano hade, konnani atsui
Anatano hade, yumenimade miru
Your skin, so hot
Your skin, I even dream about it
Ichinichi ni
Nando attemo aitarinai
Isshoni
Nando attemo aitarinai
In a day
No matter how many times we meet
It's not enough
In a lifetime
No matter how many times we meet
It's not enough
Isshoni
Nando attemo aitarinai
Ikusei ni
Isshoni
Nando attemo aitarinai
In a lifetime
No matter how many times we meet
It's not enough
In many lifetimes
No matter how many times we meet
It's not enough
Futarino koi konnani tsuyoi
Futarino koi konnani moroi
Futarino koi itsumademo
Our love so strong
Our love so frail
Our love forever
Konnani kireina
Anatano me
Your eyes, so beautiful
Your eyesEmbed
