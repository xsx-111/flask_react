Borrowed Time Lyrics
When I was younger, uh huh
Living confusion and deep despair
When I was younger, uh huh
Living illusion of freedom and power
When I was younger
Full of ideals and broken dreams, my friend
When I was younger, uh huh
Everything simple but not so clear

Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow

Now I am older
The more that I see, the less that I know for sure
Now I am older, uh huh
The future is brighter and now is the hour

Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Good to be older
Would not exchange a single day or a year
Good to be older, uh huh (You bet)
Less complication, everything clear

Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow
Living on borrowed time
Without a thought for tomorrow

Oh yes
It all seemed so bloody easy then
You know like
What to wear very serious like you know
How am I gonna get rid of the pimples
Does she really love me
All that crap
But now I don't bother about that shit no more
I know she loves me
All I gotta bother about is standing up
Alright you can get out of there2Embed
