(Forgive Me) My Little Flower Princess Lyrics
Forgive me, my little flower princess
For crushing your delicateness
Forgive me, if you could forgive me

Forgive me, my little flower princess
For my utter selfishness
Forgive me, forgive me

Well, I know there is no way to repay you
Whatever it takes I will try to
The rest of my life I will thank you
Thank you, thank you, my little

If you forgive me, my little flower princess
Never too late unless you can't
Mmm mmm

Time is on our side
Let's not waste another minute
Because I love you, my little friend
I really love you
Give me just one more chance
And I'll show you
Take up the dance where we left off
The rest of our life is the, my little

I'm homeEmbed
