Nobody Told Me Lyrics
...Three, Four!

Everybody's talking and no one says a word
Everybody's making love and no one really cares
There's matches in the bathroom just below the stairs
Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China so finish what you've got

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Strange days indeed

Everybody's running and no one makes a move
Everybody's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu
Everybody's flying and no one leaves the ground
Everybody's crying and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies, you just gotta lay around
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar mama

Everybody's smoking and no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's UFOs over New York and I ain't too surprised

Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar mama, roll!Embed
