Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him LyricsEvery man has a woman who loves him
Rain or shine or life or death
If he finds her in this lifetime
He will know when he presses his ear to her breast
Why do I roam when I know you're the one?
Why do I laugh when I feel like crying?
Every woman has a man who loves her
Rise or fall of her life and in death
If she finds him in this lifetime
She will know when she looks into his eyes
Why do I roam when I know you're the one?
Why do I run when I feel like holding you?
Every man has a woman who loves him
If he finds her in this lifetime
He will know1Embed
