P.C.P. Lyrics
Teacher starve your child, P.C. approved
As long as the right words are used
Systemised atrocity ignored
As long as bi-lingual signs on view
Ten foot sign in Oxford Street
Be pure - be vigilant - behave
Grey not neon, grey not real
Life bleeds, death is your birthright

P.C. she speaks impotent, sterile, naive, blind, atheist, sadist
Stiff-upper lip, first principle of her silence, of her silence

P.C.P. - a P.C. police victory
P.C.P. - a P.C. Pyrrhic victory
When I was young P.C. meant Police Constable
Nowadays I can't seem to tell the difference

Liposuction for your bad mouth boy
Cut out your tongue, effigies are sold
Words discoloured, bow to the bland
Heal yourself with sinner's salt
Doctors arrested for euthanasia
Kill smokers through blind vanity
If you're fat don't get ill
Europe's gravestone carved in plastic
P.C. she says inoculate, hallucinate, beware Shakespeare
Bring fresh air, king cigarette snuffed out
By her midgets, by her midgets

P.C.P. - a P.C. police victory
P.C.P. - a P.C. Pyrrhic victory
When I was young P.C. meant Police Constable
Nowadays I can't seem to tell the difference

P.C. caresses bigots and big brother, read Leviticus
Learnt censorship, pro-life equals anti-choice, to be scared of, of feathers

P.C.P. - a P.C. police victory
P.C.P. - a P.C. Pyrrhic victory
When I was young P.C. meant Police Constable
Nowadays I can't seem to tell the difference

Lawyers before love, surrogate sex
This land bows down to
Yours, unconditional love and hate
Pass the Prozac, designer amnesiac
"Two hundred and twenty-seven Lears, and I can't remember the first line."1Embed
