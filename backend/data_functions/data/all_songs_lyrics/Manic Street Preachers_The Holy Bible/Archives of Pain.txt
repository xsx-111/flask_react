Archives of Pain Lyrics
I wonder who you think you are. You damn well think you're God or something? God give life, God taketh it away, not you. I think you are the Devil itself

If hospitals cure
Then prisons must bring their pain
Don't be ashamed to slaughter
The centre of humanity is cruelty
There is never redemption
Any fool can regret yesterday
Nail it to the House of Lords
You will be buried in the same box as a killer
As a killer
As a killer

A drained white body hangs from the gallows
Is more righteous than Hindley's crotchet lectures
Pain not penance, forget martyrs, remember victims
The weak die young and right now we crouch to make them strong

Kill Yeltsin, who's saying
Zhirinovsky, Le Pen
Hindley and Brady, Ireland, Allitt, Sutcliffe
Dahmer, Nilsen, Yoshinori Ueda
Blanche and Pickles, Amin and Milosevic
Give them respect they deserve
I give them the respect they deserve
I give them the respect they deserve
I give them the respect they deserve
Execution needed
A bloody vessel for your peace
If man makes death then death makes man
Tear the torso with horses and chains
Killers view themselves like they view the world
They pick at the holes
Not punish less, rise the pain
Sterilise rapists
All I preach is extinction

Kill Yeltsin, who's saying
Zhirinovsky, Le Pen
Hindley and Brady, Ireland, Allitt, Sutcliffe
Dahmer, Nilsen, Yoshinori Ueda
Blanche and Pickles, Amin, Manic Street Preachers
Give them respect they deserve
I give them the respect they deserve
I give them the respect they deserve
I give them the respect they d-e-s-e-r-v-e2Embed
