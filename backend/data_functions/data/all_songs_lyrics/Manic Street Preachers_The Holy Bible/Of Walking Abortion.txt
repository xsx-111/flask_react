Of Walking Abortion Lyrics
I knew that someday I was gonna die. And I knew before I died
Two things would happen to me. That number one, I would regret my entire life. And number two, I would want to live my life over again

Life is lead weights, pendulum died
Pure or lost, spectator or crucified
Recognised truth acedia's blackest hole
Junkies, winos, whores; the nation's moral suicide
Loser, liar
Fake or phoney? No one cares
Everyone is guilty
Fucked up, don't know why, you poor little boy

We are all of walking abortions
Shalom shalom we all love our children
We all are of walking abortions
Shalom shalom there are no horizons

Mussolini hangs from a butcher's hook
Hitler reprised in the worm of your soul
Horthy's corpse screened to a million
Tiso revived, the horror of a bullfight
Fragments of uniforms, open black ruins
A moral conscience - you've no wounds to show
So wash your car in your 'X' baseball shoes

We are all of walking abortions
Shalom shalom we all love our children
We all are of walking abortions
Shalom shalom there are no horizons

Little people in little houses
Like maggots small blind and worthless
The massacred innocent blood stains us all
Who's responsible - you fucking are
Who's responsible - you fucking are
Who's responsible - you fucking are
Who's responsible - you fucking are
Who's responsible1Embed
