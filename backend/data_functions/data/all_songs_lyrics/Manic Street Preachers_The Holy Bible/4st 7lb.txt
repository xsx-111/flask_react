4st 7lb Lyrics
"I eat too much to die and not enough to stay alive. I'm sitting in the middle waiting."
Days since I last pissed
Cheeks sunken and despaired
So gorgeous, sunk to 6st
Lose my only remaining home
See my third rib appear
A week later all my flesh disappears
Stretch taut, cling-film on bone
I'm getting better

Karen says I've reached my target weight
Kate and Emma and Kristen know it's fake
Problem is diet's not a big enough word
I wanna be so skinny that I rot from view

Ah ah, ah ah ah
I want to walk in the snow
And not leave a footprint
Ah ah, ah ah ah
I want to walk in the snow
And not soil its purity
Stomach collapsed at five
Lift up my skirt, my sex is gone
Naked and lovely and 5st 2
May I bud and never flower
My vision's getting blurred
But I can see my ribs and I feel fine
My hands are trembling stalks
And I can feel my breasts are sinking

Mother tries to choke me with roast beef
And sits savouring her sole Ryvita
That's the way you're built my father said
But I can change, my cocoon shedding

Ah ah, ah ah ah
I want to walk in the snow
And not leave a footprint
Ah ah, ah ah ah
I want to walk in the snow
And not soil its purity

Kate and Kristin and Kit Kat
All things I like looking at
Too weak to fuss, too weak to die
Choice is skeletal in everybody's life
I choose, my choice, I starve to frenzy
Hunger soon passes and sickness soon tries
Legs bend, stockinged I am Twiggy
And I don't mind the horror that surrounds me
Self-worth scatters, self-esteem's a bore
I long since moved to a higher plateau
This discipline's so rare so please applaud
Just look at the fat scum who pamper me so
Yeah, 4st 7, an epilogue of youth
Such beautiful dignity in self-abuse
I've finally come to understand life
Through staring blankly at my navelEmbed
