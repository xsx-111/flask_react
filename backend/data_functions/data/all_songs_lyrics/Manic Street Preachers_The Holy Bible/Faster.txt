Faster Lyrics
I hate purity. I hate goodness. I don't want virtue to exist anywhere. I want everyone corrupt

I am an architect
They call me a butcher
I am a pioneer
They call me primitive
I am purity
They call me perverted
Holding you but I only miss these things when they leave

I am idiot drug hive
The virgin, the tattered and the torn
Life is for the cold made warm and they are just lizards
Self disgust is self-obsession honey and I do as I please
A morality obedient only to the cleansed repented

I am stronger than Mensa
Miller and Mailer, I spat out Plath and Pinter
I am all the things that you regret
A truth that washes that learnt how to spell

The first time you see yourself naked you cry
Soft skin now acne
Foul breath so broken
He loves me truly this mute solitude I'm draining
I know I believe in nothing but it is my nothing
Sleep cannot hide thoughts splitting through my mind
Shadows aren't clean, false mirrors too many people awake
If you stand up like a nail then you will be knocked down
I've been too honest with myself I should have lied like everybody else

I am stronger than Mensa
Miller and Mailer, I spat out Plath and Pinter
I am all the things that you regret
A truth that washes that learnt how to spell, how to spell

So damn easy to cave in, man kills everything
So damn easy to cave in, man kills everything
So damn easy to cave in, man kills everything
So damn easy to cave in, man kills everything2Embed
