The Falling Veil LyricsRunning through the fields
Chasing down the ones you think you need
Throwing off the chains, cursing years in vain
Living in a myth, the boundaries of which lie in decay
The body seeks to convalesce
The earth we deem it's own redress
Residuum amongst the stars
Fortuned sons of fractal eyes
Lay down the tools of war and gold
To die and metamorphosize
As we walk the path it fades
Disengage and ties become unwound
Don't resist the grain, set fire the groundEmbed
