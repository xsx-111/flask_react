Blind LyricsGrasping only as it fades
The simple truth we lost
As hours turned to days
And in the afterglow it seemed
The wishing well is full
Of worthless currency
Condemned to watch the whole charade
The monuments of man fall into decay
The promise, grand in golden script
The night in all its gray and sorrow dispossess
A mirror to the other side
We are only blind
Their teeth can only gnash your eyes
If you let them smile
They see their will in the eyes of the broken
And raise a glass in the din of the fray
We're only staring down the face of the olden
Scorching Earth at the dying of daysEmbed
