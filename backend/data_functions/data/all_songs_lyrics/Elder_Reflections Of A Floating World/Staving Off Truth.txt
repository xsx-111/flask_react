Staving Off Truth LyricsGrasping at the edge
Somewhere on the other side
Tending the sleeping ground
Clutching to the knife
Slipping out of day
Machinery drowning out
Fortress inner world
Staving off the doubt
Wrestling memories
Hold the past in broken arms
Shards cut to the quick
Before the cruciform
Morning star is the dawn
Cast the shadow of the cross
Groping in the dark
For answers to the loss
Are we waiting just to leave?
Is there an answer which eludes?
We stand upon a floating world
Simply staving off the truthEmbed
