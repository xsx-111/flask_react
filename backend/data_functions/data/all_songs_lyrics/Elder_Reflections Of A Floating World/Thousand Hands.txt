Thousand Hands LyricsThere stands an alabaster throne
Carved into halls where no light has shown
Reign of years before all time
Beyond the reach of celestial eyes
When the past has come to bear
The fruits of seeds we've sewn in spite
Who carries blame for our despair?
A thousand hands beyond the light
From the past is nothing won
Hail glory to the victors
They will crush us just the sameEmbed
