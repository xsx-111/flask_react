Across the Water LyricsFall into sleep as the sun comes up
And wake at the back of noon
Drift through the hours as the sun gets lower
Till the days are lit by the moon
Every day is every day
Can't tell one from the other
Wait to fall at the end of it all
As stones skip across the water
Lived on wit, got away with it
Hummed a universal tune
Found a thread away in the head
Followed it over the moon
Every day is every day
One foot in front of the other
Learn to fall with the grace of it all
As stones skip across the water2Embed
