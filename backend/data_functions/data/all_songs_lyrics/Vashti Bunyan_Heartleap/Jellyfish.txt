Jellyfish LyricsLast night I dreamt that I jumped in the sea
Wearing a pale blue flouncing dancing dress
I wanted you to rescue me
Desperately
Last night I dreamt that you were looking down
I twisted and twirled
And held my skirt out like a girl
I could see you frown at me
Soundlessly...
And then I saw that all that you saw
Was a Portuguese Man of War
Then I saw that all that you saw
Was a Portuguese Man of War
Last night I dreamt that I drowned in the sea
Wearing your frown and going down
And down
And down
I've come to my senses now
Hopefully
Hopefully
Hopefully...Embed
