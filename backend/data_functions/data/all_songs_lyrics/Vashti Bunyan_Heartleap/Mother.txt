Mother LyricsMy mother would dance sometimes
Believing herself alone
But through a slightly open door
I would watch her as she turned
Turned round, round
Briefly unbound
My mother played and sang sometimes
Believing herself alone
But through a slightly open door
I could see her face upturned
Songs long learned
So long untuned
I was her only audience
She believes herself alone
My applause should have been rapturous
But I close the door
And turned, turned awayEmbed
