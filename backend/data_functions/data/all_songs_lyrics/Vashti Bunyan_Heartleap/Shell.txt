Shell LyricsIn the telling of your story
There is so much that's lost
There's an ocean in between
The seen and unseen
That's as deep as the loss was
To you so young
I just see a shell
Can't really get the picture
I've nothing to compare
Can't say I understand
Have no hand to lend
You had more than your fair share
For one so young
But you do it all so well
I fold things just like my mother
Into two then into three
I don't know why I do
But then I think of you
And what it takes to be free
From all you've learned
But you know it all too well
In the telling of your story
You say there's so much more
Then you curl away from me
To some deeper sea
And I'm here on the foreshore
Till your return
I just see a shellEmbed
