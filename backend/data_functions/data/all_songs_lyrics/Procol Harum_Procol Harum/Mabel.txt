Mabel Lyrics
Don't eat green meat, it ain't good for you
Killed your brother, killed your sister too
Eatin' fresh-fried chicken on new-mown sand
Can't beat red beans eaten out of your hand

Oh Mabel, Mabel
You know I love you, girl
But I'm not able
Mabel, oh Mabel
Please get off the kitchen table

Don't slice no onions, don't peel no grapes
Dream about banana slice, no smell-around shortcake
And if on a winter's tale, you find your sundial's wrong
You know the weather is what's brought it on

Hey Mabel, Mabel
You know I love you, girl
But I'm not able
Mabel, hey Mabel
Please get off the kitchen table
Put the peas on the pot, put the pot on the hot
In the cellar lies my wife, in my wife there's a knife
So tote that hammer, lift that pick
And banish inhibition with a pogo stick

Hey Mabel, Mabel
You know I love you, girl
But I'm not able
Oh Mabel, hey Mabel
Please get off the kitchen tableEmbed
