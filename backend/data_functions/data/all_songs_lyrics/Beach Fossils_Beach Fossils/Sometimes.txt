Sometimes LyricsWell I can understand
But I really don't care to know
And you can take my hand
But I don't care where we go
And if you think you know
What I'm thinking about
And I can read your thoughts
Without any doubts
Then we can go
Well let's go on
And if I happen to fall
Then please don't pick me up
'Cause we're enjoying our time
And I wouldn't wanna interrupt
It works out so well
When you discover that it's all the same
We get lost sometimes
But the reality will keep us sane
I know I think too much
I know I waste my time
And I can't figure out
Which one is yours or mine
But that's fine
I really couldn't say I mind4Embed
