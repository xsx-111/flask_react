Daydream LyricsI'm not upset
When you're around
I think I lose myself
The second that I see I'm found
And not a day goes by
Or an hour without
Times I can't remember
What I'm thinking about
'Cause my head's caught up
And tangled in those dreams
I go uptown
On a quiet day
Just to gather my thoughts
When I don't know what to say
And we go outside
When the morning's dark
And we fall in the grass
Of an open park
And the sun will break
When our heads hit the dream
And I'm on time
Though I didn't try
And the seconds move slow
But the moment's all too right
And not a day goes by
Or an hour without
Times I can't remember
What I'm thinking about
'Cause my head's caught up
And tangled in those dreams
Daydream the days up2Embed
