Golden Age LyricsI'm not trying to lose my mind
But I wouldn't care If I couldn't find
You only see what you wanna see
I don't want you to see me
I don't know what I'm doing tonight
I never know what I'm doing at night
I never have plans when it turns to night
'Cause I don't do nothing but stay inside
And I open my eyes and everything's blue
From the top of the sky to underneath you
Ain't trying to do more than just sit here
I can look in your eyes and tell you're sincere
And we're dropping it off
And we're not coming back
Cause we're trying to get lost
We both know that
You can gather the wine
And I'll carry the shades
And we'll hide in the pride
Of the Golden Age
I'm unlocking the doors
And we'll go to the roof
Cause the stories we told
Are becoming the truth
Just put out your hand
And I'll take it in mine
Walk down to the center
Of the wind and shine
We'll take a swig
And we'll lie right down
We'll become all the colors
Of each others sounds
We can pick one up
And we'll let it fly
Cause in the Golden age
We'll never die2Embed
