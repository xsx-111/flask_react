Youth LyricsIt's not so worth
Getting all bent out of shape about
I turn my back on it
And next you know it's all run out
Do you wanna step outside
Or do you want it right
I don't know just what I feel
But I feel it all tonight
I give it all
In these hours that we set aside
I know I'm feeling brief
But that's because my heart's untied
Don't wanna trim
Any more off of our only truth
We've got enough to spare
'Cause we're awake throughout our youth5Embed
