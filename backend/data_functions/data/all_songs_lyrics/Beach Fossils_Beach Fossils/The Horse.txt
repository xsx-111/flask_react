The Horse LyricsI couldn't talk to you
But I'd love to walk with you
I drop from the sky
Right as you say goodbye
Forever
Have parted our dreams
I lost my heart for you
And I'd set it free for two
Stones on the ground
Uncovering lines
That I never once
Knew were there
The horse
Oh you
The horse
With your head to the sky
Will you turn back again
And I turning my head
The horse
Is no longer more2Embed
