Lazy Day LyricsI felt the grass
On my chest in the open field
And I knew there was
Nothing left for me to feel
Airplanes above
Cross the sky
Under the haze
In the morning time
We didn't think
About our days
The wind was blowing
Through our hair
As we lied down
And we could feel
Under our backs
That the earth was round
Lazy today
Lazy tonight
And later on
All we had to do
Was nothing at all
Under the sun1Embed
