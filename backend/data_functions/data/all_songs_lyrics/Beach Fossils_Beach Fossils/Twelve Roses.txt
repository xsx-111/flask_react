Twelve Roses LyricsWhat have I been doing here
And what's the biggest chase
How will we be listening
When we're slipping out the race
Roses pushed inside my palm
And rushing with the fun
You've already finished it
When the notion's just begun
And I
Don't know what I'm doing here
And I
Can't say why you would be here
I've seen roses
Twelve feet tall
With their hearts on their shoulders
And that's not all
I've seen roses
Six feet tall
With their hearts on their shoulders
And that's not allEmbed
