Window View LyricsI never wanted it to happen
On that day
Wanted to stay inside
And watch the rain
We walked down to the water
Hand in hand
I knew it was the last time
I would stand
In the freezing wind
I'm looking at your face
Your thoughts are running
As you turn away
Grey skies on the outskirts
Of this town
I'm heading home
It's time to settle downEmbed
