Vacation LyricsI'm getting on that bus
Got to get out of town
It's all that's on my mind
Leave the city behind
I see the mountainside
The trees and sky collide
I'm out here on my own
I might not come back home
I gaze out my window
Scenery comes and goes
I let the time pass by
Soon I'll be by your side
Head south like times before
Nothing to worry for
I'm on my way to you
It's all I want to doEmbed
