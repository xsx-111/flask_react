Natural Born Bugie Lyrics{Intro}
There she is again steppin' out of her limousine, well
Looking like the cover of a twenty-dollar magazine
She's got it where you find it, if you know what I mean
She's a natural born woman
A natural born woman
She's a natural born woman
{Hook}
There she is again watch her stop the Main Street in its tracks
Looking like Creole queen, hair hangin' down her back
I say, don't look too long, boy, she'll make your glasses crack
She's a natural born woman
A natural born woman
Natural born woman
{Bridge}
Get your track
Yeah, natural born woman
Yeah, yeah...
Natural born woman
Yeah, yeah...
She's a natural born woman
{Hook}
Well, I'm sweatin' and I'm shakin' when I'm bringin' you the news
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
That's why I'm standin' here today preachin' natural born woman blues
Well, she's a natural born woman
Well, yeah, she's a natural born woman
Well, yeah, natural born woman
Well, I'm looking out my back door wonderin' which place to go
Think I'll move on down to Memphis, pay my money to see a rock 'n' roll show
Find me a sweet-heart Susie, together we can lose control
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a natural born woman
Yeah, yeah, natural born woman
Yeah, natural born woman
{Outro}
Yeah, ooh
Ooh
All right
