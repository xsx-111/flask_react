Growing Closer LyricsHere I am with dust in my pants
I don't know what to do
Been on the road for almost a week
I just wanna be with you
Makes no difference where I am
Feeling hard to breathe
If I thought you felt the same
Wouldn't be so bad for me
Thought I know all about it from the start
Took a short cut to nowhere
To make it feel alright
Got to cut this travelling out
I hate sayin' goodbye
We leave the day we arrive
Or I'll wanna know why
Crowing closer, comin' in out of the dark
Here I am with dust in my pants
I don't know what to do
Been on the road for almost a week
I just wanna be with youEmbed
