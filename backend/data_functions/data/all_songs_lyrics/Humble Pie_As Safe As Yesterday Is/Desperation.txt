Desperation LyricsRaindrops fall and you feel low
Do you ever feel it's useless, yeah yeah ? Do you feel like letting go ?
Well do you ever stop and do you wonder ? Will the world ever change ?
Yes, well just how long will it take to have it all re-arranged ?
Tell me why these things are still the same ?
Tell me why no one can seem to learn from mistakes ?
Take my hand if you don't know where you're goin'
I'll understand I've lost the way myself
Oh, won't you, oh don't take that old road, it leads to nowhere
We must return before the clock strikes twelve
Oh, it's so easy to do nothin' when you're busy night and day
Take a step in one direction, ooh yeah take a step the other way
So, don't quit tryin' when you stumble, don't give up should you fall
Oh, won't you keep on searchin' for the pathway that leads you through the wall
Don't look back or you'll be left behind
Don't look back or you will never find peace of mind
Take my hand if you don't know where you're goin'
I'll understand, you know I've, I've lost the way myself
Now listen here, I don't want to, I don't want to take that old road, it leads to nowhere
We must return before the clock strikes twelveEmbed
