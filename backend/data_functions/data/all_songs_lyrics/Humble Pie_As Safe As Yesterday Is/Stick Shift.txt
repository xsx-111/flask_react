Stick Shift LyricsWorking every day of my life
See what you can under candlelight
A dollar a day don't go so far
My mowan's alive and I know she strive for me
I know that times are bad but I'm so glad
My woman come back to me and soon we be three
A dollar a day don't go so far
My mowan's alive and I know she strive for me
Put me on a stick shift
Put me on a stick shiftEmbed
