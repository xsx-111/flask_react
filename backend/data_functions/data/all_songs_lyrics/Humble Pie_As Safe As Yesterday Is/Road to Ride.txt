Road to Ride LyricsLittle black train goin' down the track
Took my baby away
If she ever come back
Be a brand new day
Sittin' out here in the midnight cold
Waitin' for the morning sun
I don't wanna be old, Lord
I just wanna die young
Lookin' out my back door
I wonder which place to go
Get my ticket on the Rock Island Line
The Rock Island Line is a mighty fine road to ride
Lookin' out my back door baby
I'm wonderin' which place to go
Get my ticket on the Rock Island Line
I know the Rock Island Line is a mighty fine road to ride
Little black train goin' down the track
Took my baby and gone
If she ever come back to me
I'm gonna sing her this songEmbed
