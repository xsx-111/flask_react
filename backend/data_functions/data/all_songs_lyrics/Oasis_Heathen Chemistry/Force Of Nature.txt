Force Of Nature Lyrics
Yeah, I feel like the force of nature
Could make you sing like a bird released
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure
You know it's buried beneath your feet
You know you look like a faded picture
I see the cracks freezing on your skin
And as the world slowly turns it hits you
That the thieves of the night
Are coming to take you in

For smoking all my stash
And burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
It's all over town that
The sun's going down
On the days of your easy life

I bet you knew right away
You dope you don't know where it's at
It's all over town
That the sun's gone down
And it's high time to pray
Yeah, I feel like the force of nature
Could make you sing like a bird released
If what you seek is the wise man's treasure
You know it's buried beneath your feet
You know you look like faded picture
I see the cracks frozen on your skin
And as the world slowly turns it hits you
That the thieves of the night
Are coming to take you in

For smoking all my stash
And burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
It's all over town that
The sun's going down
On the days of your easy life

I bet you knew right away
You dope, you don't know where it's at
It's all over, if you're begging me please
Then get on your knees and pray

You're smoking all my stash
You're burning all my cash
I bet you knew right away
It's all over town that
The sun's gone down
And it's high time to pray
(Itâ€™s me you want)2Embed
