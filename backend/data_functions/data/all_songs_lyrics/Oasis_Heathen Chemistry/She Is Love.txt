She Is Love Lyrics
Oh, when the sunshine beckons to you
And your wings begin to unfold
The thoughts you bring and the songs you sing
Are going to keep me from the cold
And if the sword is heated among you
And its words may wound my soul
You can fill me up with what you've got
Because my heart's been keeping old

She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
Love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe I do believe her when she speaks

You're in all my thoughts of passion
And the dreams of my delight
Whatever stirs my mortal frame
Will you keep it warm at night?
I don't know where you come from
No, I haven't got a clue
All I know is I'm in love
With someone who loves me too

She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
Love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe I do believe her when she speaks

She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe her when she speaks
She is love
And her ways are high and steep
She is love
And I believe I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks
I do believe her when she speaks2Embed
