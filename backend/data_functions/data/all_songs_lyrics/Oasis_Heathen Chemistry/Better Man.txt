Better Man Lyrics
I want to love you
I want to be a better man
I don't want to hurt you
I just want to see what's in your hand

But all right now, yeah, yeah
Well, all right now, yeah, yeah

And I know you'll understand
And I know you'll understand

I want to love you
I want to be a better man
I don't want to hurt you
I just want to see what's in your hand

But all right now, yeah, yeah
Well, all right now, yeah, yeah

And I know you'll understand
And I know you'll understand
I want to be a better manEmbed
