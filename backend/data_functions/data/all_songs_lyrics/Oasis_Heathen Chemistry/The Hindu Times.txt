The Hindu Times Lyrics
I get up
When I'm down
I can't swim
But my soul won't drown
I do believe
I got flair
I got speed
And I walk on air

'Cause God gimme soul in your rock and roll, babe
'Cause God gimme soul in your rock and roll, babe
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain
Running through my vein
You're my sunshine
You're my rain

There's a light
That shines on
Shines on me
And it keeps me warm
It gimme peace
I must say
I can't sleep
'Cause the world won't wait
'Cause God gimme soul in your rock and roll, babe
'Cause God gimme soul in your rock and roll, babe
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain
Running through my vein
You're my sunshine
You're my rain

And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
In and out my brain
Running through my vein
You're my sunshine
You're my rain2Embed
