I Want To Be Free Lyrics
There's no joy in my heart, only sorrow
And I'm sad as a man can be
I sit alone in the darkness of my lonely room
And this room is a prison to me

I look out my window
And what do I see?
I see a bird
Way up in a tree
I want to be free (oh yes), free (oh yes)
Free
I want to be free
Like a bird in a tree (wanna be free)

Oh, what good are my eyes, they can't see you
And my arms, they can't hold you so tight
I have two lips that are yearning
But they're no good to me
'Cause I know I can't kiss you tonight

I look out my window
And what do I see?
I see a bird
Way up in a tree
I want to be free (oh yes), free (oh yes)
Free
I want to be free
Like a bird in a tree (want to be free)
I want to be free
Like a bird in a tree (want to be free)1Embed
