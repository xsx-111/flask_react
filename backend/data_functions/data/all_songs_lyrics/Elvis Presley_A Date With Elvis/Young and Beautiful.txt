Young and Beautiful Lyrics
You're so young and beautiful
And I love you so
Your lips so red, your eyes that shine
Shame the stars that glow

So fill these lonely arms of mine
And kiss me tenderly
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me

You're so young and beautiful
You're everything I love
Your angel smile, your gentle touch
Are all I'm dreaming of

Oh, take this heart I offer you
And never set me free
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me1Embed
