Gorgeous Love LyricsI can feel the waves of your gorgeous love
And it hurts to think that this is seen as wrong
I can take your pain, anything, to overcome our fear
And we're strong, strong enough to prove it
I notice things about you as the morning kisses your eyes
How your face relaxes through the caress of night
How in the evening it's tense and pulled features
And we know how easily we can smooth them
You turn to touch me to hold me fast
You turn to touch me to whisper your love
Here are the words of those who dared to speak
Of this open noisy big brilliant love
Which is all I have to give
I never knew that our need for love could be so strong
I'm not confessing, time disappears when we're alone
I'm not ashamed of expressing the love I hold for you
It's ultra-romantic, I fear everything that's not you
I fell asleep, when I wake
You were staring at me in this draining orange London lightEmbed
