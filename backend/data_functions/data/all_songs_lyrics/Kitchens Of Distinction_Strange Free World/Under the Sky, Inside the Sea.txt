Under the Sky, Inside the Sea LyricsWell here we are standing at the sea
The sea eats the shore it's always hungry
We fall from laughing at the size of it all
Drinking wishing smoking hoping
He says "Well, here we are at the edge of the world."
Well here we are standing at the sea
Paradise is not where he wants to be
He counts the stars wishing they were blurred
Willing the sky to paint them green
Well here we are staring at the sun
Under the sky, inside the seaEmbed
