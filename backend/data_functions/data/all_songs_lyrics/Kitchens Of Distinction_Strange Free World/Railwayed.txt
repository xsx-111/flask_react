Railwayed Lyrics
Softly softly comes
The train into the station
She has often waited
And wondered if he'll come
Why has he kept her waiting
Held from coming home now
Was it troubled loyalty
Or a brand new family
Will he step down
Onto the platform
Will he stay now
Or go again

Softly something comes
A feeling that she loves him
Remembering his birthday
And sentimental times
Was she really that bad
To force him to silence
Were her tears forgotten
Or was it just that letter of pain
"Daddy will you
Stay this time?
Daddy will you
Walk away?"
Shower her
With your own tears
Give to her
That lovely lost look
Open now
Those cold blue eyes
Promise her
There'll be no more goodbyes
No goodbyes

Softly something feeling
As if she is just dreaming
Daddy she has been good
You must be here to stay
Slowly steam is rising
She's shouting as she sees you
She's running up to hold you
Will your arms be there?
"Daddy will you
Stay this time?
Daddy will you
Go again?"
Shower her
With your own tears
Give to her
That lovely lost look
Open now
Those cold blue eyes
Promise her
There'll be no more goodbyes
No surprise
No more surprise


Shower her
With your own tears
Give to her
That lovely lost look
Open now
Those cold blue eyes
Promise her
There'll be no more goodbyes
No surprise
No more surprise
No surpriseEmbed
