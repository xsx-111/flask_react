Hypnogogic LyricsThis fluid motion
In and out of sleep
Gets the mind awondering
Between roadsides and streets
Between mountainsides
And boats and aeroplane rides
Not knowing what's controlling
The scenes in front of my eyes
Bemused bewildered a hundred times thankful
I'm in the lap of the sweetest hours
I have slept ten thousand nights
And I'll wake from a thousand more
Being in and out of different worlds
And hoping for millions more
When I wake to find something's changed
I'm deceived for the world spins on the same
No raw area
In sleep there is no pain
No joy no love no worry
Maybe an unquiet dream
I'll turn away from laughter
I'll turn away from love
When the finest sanctuary unfolds
And pulls me underneath
Bemused bewildered and a hundred times thankful
I'm in the lap of the sweetest hoursEmbed
