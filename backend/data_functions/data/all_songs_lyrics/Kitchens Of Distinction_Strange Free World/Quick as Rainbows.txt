Quick as Rainbows Lyrics
As she walks home tonight
To her house and ignores the stars
She knows there's no-one waiting
Tomorrow isn't clear enough
To give her strength or make her want
To wake and walk in the morning

And there's hope that I've taken
And there's drugs to make it painless
And men, we're quick as rainbows
Always rare to keep her thirsty
And I've gone, like she'd always known
And I've gone, like she'd always known

As I walk home tonight
To my house and ignore the stars
I know there's someone waiting
Tomorrow is very clear
It gives me strength and makes me want
To wake and walk in the morning
But there's hope that I've taken
And there's drugs to make it painless
And men, we're quick as rainbows
Always rare to keep her thirsty
And I've gone, like she'd always known
And I've gone, like she'd always known

There were times of troubled dreams of hate
I'd take her down to the lake with our love
Watch it swim, we'd watch it drown
Watch our love bob up and down

As she walks home tonight
To her house and ignores the stars
She knows there's no-one waiting
Tomorrow isn't clear enough
To give her strength or make her want
To wake and walk in the morning

And there's hope that I've taken
And there's drugs to make it painless
And men, we're quick as rainbows
Always rare to keep her thirsty
And I've gone, like she'd always known
And I've gone, like she'd always known
Always corpses at breakfast timeEmbed
