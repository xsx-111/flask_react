He Holds Her, He Needs Her LyricsRestless in the arms of the one she loved to hold
Pulling back as if to say I need space, let me alone
She cannot leave him being the man he is
When he holds her he tells her that he needs her
Restless in the arms of the one she loved to hold
Pulling back as if to say, I need space, let me alone
She wakes to the sound of growing fear outside
Inside there's silence still the urgent need to leave
Beware my wings she'd say
My hundred eyes and changing skin
You cannot know me anymore
She'd frown and fly and out she'd go
What is it he asks.  Beware my wings she wants to say
Then she leans over and makes to tear them off
No more flying without you she says and laughs
He looks at her with stones in his eyes
Ease away the stones and let's see what's underneath
The things that pull us apart, the fears that pull love apartEmbed
