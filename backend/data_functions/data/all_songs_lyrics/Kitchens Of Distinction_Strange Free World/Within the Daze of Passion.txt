Within the Daze of Passion LyricsThis good I swear I'm staying lurking in your arms
So good in sin I'm staying with you and your bitter senses
Waking within the daze of...
Tell me this is so easy inside your words and feelings
Promise me there'll be no ending
Stay here with your brilliant kisses, please
Waking within the daze of passion
I cannot rouse myself from this slap of passion
I cannot pull away from this daze of passion
No good in pretending
I want you right now
Turn around and whisper sweetly
I cannot fake any more
Not waking within the daze of...
Touched, used, I can take it
Lost now as love tightens
Yes, good, there is no ending
You're here with your easy wishes, I fulfill
Not waking within the daze of passionEmbed
