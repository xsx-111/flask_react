Aspray LyricsI was shorebound within seas glare
On blue coat-tails twirling spent
Blistered foray spits in my eyes
I'll slough this drought of life
Sink wrecked weak
About potent turns of thunder
Lightening dagger's up
A thrill now my heart pumps
Matching tideflow turning
I'll jump and splash and jump and crash
And I wanted to shed my skin
Into the ocean's suck
Twisted mountain men
Flowing aspray
And I wanted to shed my fear
Into the ocean's suck
Twisted mountain men
Flowing aspray
I was seadrunk under seaspell
Listen, the swell of the surf
Shameless surging deeper urging
Deeper and deeper still
Still shunned ocean engulf me
Under seachange like a diver
Snake-dancing spouting free
There's no memory of before me
Grinning water winks
The ocean sand
Beach burned nauseaEmbed
