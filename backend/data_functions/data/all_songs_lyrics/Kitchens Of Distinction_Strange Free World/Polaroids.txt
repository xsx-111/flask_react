Polaroids Lyrics
Here are several pictures and pictures mean the past
Here's a pretty desert scene and here a sea of grass
Likely orchards and vacant lots, big men grinning and holding hands
All the time the season's win and everything is lost

Something said's been said before but it's often worth repeating
All the times that made the world are slipping into forgetting
How are you and what did you do before you started thinking?
I am fine and shaky still, this side of things gets clearer

I'll never have the time to suffer my easy past
I'll never have a camera to disturb my rosy past
I'll never have a sober night whilst the drink lasts

Here is a picture, I guess he's probably dead
Here's another picture, the fantastic three off their heads
Ignore this Western trip, little thing, there's so many other ideas
I live in the songlines of boys from all over the world

Something said's been said before and here I am repeating
That all the times that made my world cannot be forgotten
And I'll never have a camera to keep these lies
Here am I sitting in the sun with burning skin and a big red book
And here are you on holiday, I wonder if you'd still look that way

These damn pictures
I could forget
Things so quickly
But they're always here
And I cannot throw
Memories away
Here comes the sickler
With his brand new polaroids


Here are several pictures and pictures mean the past
Here I go into fogginess, all my past destroyedEmbed
