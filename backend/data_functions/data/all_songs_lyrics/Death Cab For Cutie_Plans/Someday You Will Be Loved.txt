Someday You Will Be Loved LyricsI once knew a girl
In the years of my youth
With eyes like the summer
All beauty and truth
But in the morning I fled
Left a note and it read:
"Someday you will be loved"
I cannot pretend that I felt any regret
Cause each broken heart will eventually mend
And as the blood runs red down the needle and thread
Someday you will be loved

You'll be loved, you'll be loved
Like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved
You may feel alone
When you're falling asleep
Every time tears roll down your cheek
But I know your heart belongs
To someone you've yet to meet
Someday you will be loved
You'll be loved, you'll be loved
Like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved
You'll be loved, you'll be loved
Like you never have known
And the memories of me will seem more like bad dreams
Just a series of blurs like I never occurred
Someday you will be loved
Someday you will be loved2Embed
