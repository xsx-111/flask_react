Your Heart Is an Empty Room LyricsBurn it down 'til the embers smoke on the ground
And start new when your heart is an empty room
With walls of the deepest blue
Home's face
How it ages when you're away
And spring blooms then you find a love that's true
But you don't know what now to do
Cause the chase is all you know and she stopped running months ago
And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone
The flames and smoke climbed out of every window
And disappeared with everything that you held dear
But you shed not a single tear
For the things that you didn't need
Cause you knew you were finally free
Cause all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone
And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And there on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone4Embed
