Different Names for the Same Thing Lyrics
Alone on a train
Aimless in wander
An outdated map
Crumpled in my pocket
But I didn't care where I was going
They're all different names for the same place

The coast disappeared when the sea drowned the sun
I knew no words to share it with anyone
The boundaries of language I quietly cursed
And all the different names for the same thing

There are different names for the same thing
There are different names for the same thing
There are different namesEmbed
