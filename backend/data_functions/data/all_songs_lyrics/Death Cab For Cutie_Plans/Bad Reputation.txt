Bad Reputation LyricsI know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
I couldn't have one conversation
If it wasn't for the lies, lies, lies
And still I want to tell you everything
Until I close my eyes
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappeared below my feet
Been breaking down, do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm down in Harold Square
Looking in a crowd your face is everywhere
Been turning around, do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Don't try to be an inspiration
You're just wasting your time, time, time
You know I'm about the best I'll ever be
I see it in your eyes
I know I got a bad reputation
And it isn't just talk, talk, talk
If I could only give you everything
You know I haven't got
Suddenly I'm on the street
Seven years disappeared below my feet
Been breaking down, do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm in another place
Looking in the crowd
I think I see your face
Been turning around
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Don't you think I've heard the talk
Nobody's going to tell me who to look
Been breaking down do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Suddenly I'm in Harold Square
Looking in a crowd, your face is everywhere
Been turning around, do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
Do you want me now?
But I'm just breaking down, down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down, down
Been breaking down, down, down, down, downEmbed
