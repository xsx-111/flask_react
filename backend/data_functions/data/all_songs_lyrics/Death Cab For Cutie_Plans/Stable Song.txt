Stable Song Lyrics
Time for the final bout
Rows of deserted houses, all
Our stablemates highway-bound

Give us our measly sum
Getting the air inside my lungs
Is heavenly, starting out
With nothing but crippling doubt

We'll rest easy
Justified

Suffered a swift defeat
I'll endure countless repeats
The gift of memory's an awful curse
With age, it just gets much worse

But I won't mind
I won't mind
I won't mind
I won't mindEmbed
