Houdini Said LyricsDoctor in love who is above
All others close to you
Is it the Queen is it obscene
Tell me I want you to
Oh I've often wondered what it is that incites
So many young people to take part in those riots
Whereby all men in blue are the targets to destroy
Lady be good I wish you would
Meanwhile exclusively
Have I the right to print in spite
Of what your views would be
Concerning those matters of the utmost degree
The point being the question and the question being he
Who laughs first has a thirst to laugh longest
Has he?
Over there (over where)
Over there (over where)
On the wall (what wall)
The one in the hall (oh the hall)
I can see (we can see)
Well you could have fooled me
Some take the attitude that life is a drag
They say and I quote "Man it just isn't our bag"
But if that's where it's at why the hell don't they go
Houdini said to get out of bed
Was the hardest thing he could do
Yet when he's tied strait-jacket plied
He's out at the count of two
It seems elementary my dear Watson I know
But think what would happen if for instance this show
That we're in should begin not one hour but
Two late
Over there (over where)
Over there (over where)
On the wall (what wall)
The one in the hall (oh the hall)
I can see (we can see)
Well you could have fooled meEmbed
