Thunder and Lightning LyricsThere's people who believe
That what we're to receive
Is meant to happen anyway
Then there're those who'll admit
That they're literally scared stiff of it
No matter what you say
Then there are those who'll astound
By simply being around to play
Thunder and lightning ain't worth fighting
So lock yourself away or else face it all tonight
I was supposed to meet her at eight
Now I find it's gone eight
And I haven't done a thing
There's people all around me
People who have found me
Not very funny when I sing
A little song about the bad things
The weather can do
Thunder and lightning ain't worth fighting
So lock yourself away or else face it all tonight
People running everywhere
There's not a soul who'll stay out there
And I don't think there will be tonight
But we've got to accept what's right
Thunder and lightning
I'm trying hard to remember
Was it last November
When I got caught under a tree
I stood there like a fool
Without so much as a stool
That I could sit upon to comfort me
I shudder at the thought
Howerer I got out safely
Thunder and lightning ...Embed
