Everybody Knows LyricsEverybody knows that the world is round
That is everybody 'cept me
'Cause I ain't been told
So why should I be forced to believe
That the feet I wear are meant to bear
Pieces of leather that shine
No that can't be true
Cause I can't find a piece to fit mine
When I walk downtown
Dressed up like a clown
People they just burst into tears
Lift their heads and whisper in my ears
Cover up your toes 'cause everybody knows
When I walk downtown
Dressed up like a clown
People they just burst into tears
Lift their heads and whisper in my ears
Cover up your toes 'cause everybody knows
That the state we're in
Is about to begin
And if that's not enough
You try to balance a plate
While eating granny smelly's mince pie
When I walk downtown
Dressed up like a clown
People they just burst into tears
Lift their heads and whisper in my ears
Cover up your toes 'cause everybody knowsEmbed
