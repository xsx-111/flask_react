Bye-Bye LyricsI've only this to say to you know why
Good bye, bye bye
My loneliness endears it but so do I
Good bye, bye bye
You'd think by now that somehow
You'd have changed
Long range no change
Forget me now you know how I will you
Will you please do?
I've only this to say to you know why
Good bye, bye bye
Forget me now you know how I will you
Will you please do?
I don't know why
Sometimes I lie
Other times I tell the truth
Sometimes even out of spite
I'm uncouthEmbed
