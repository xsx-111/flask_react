Too Much Attention LyricsThere is too much attention
Paid to people who believe
That the world we live in
Really isn't round
Yes there's too much attention
Paid to people just like me
Who'll confess their only aim in life
Is down
There is too much attention
As to where we all should be
And to how much we should know
Inside how long
Yes there's too much attention
And the reason I believe
Is because we are what we are right or wrong
So forgive me when I tell you
I ain't got no place to go
I ain't got no-one to talk to
Got no one left to say hello
There is too much attention
Paid to him who shot at he
And to how he got away
But didn't quite
Yes there's too much attention
So much so that we'll believe
He's not guilty of the crime which he's
Being tried
So forgive me when I tell you
I ain't got no place to go
I ain't got no-one to talk to
Got no one left to say helloEmbed
