Susan van Heusen LyricsLittle Susan Van Heusen was present
When her father decided to play
Cat and mouse round the house with that peasant
Girl of a B good and maybe I will stay
For a while if you smile but remember
When my head is bowed
It is not because I am sad
Merely that old blue me
Getting me down
As you've guessed it was best that she rid her
Self from this an unfriendly affair
So without more to do than say dither
Suzi went over the hill and back again
I will go in a mo
But first you'd better book up cos I
Have no piece to perform
Have no role to play
Other than that one of me
Eaten by you
All the way through
Down to the last
Very last chew
In the end so to speak it was easy
To suppose she would never return
Even though her old man tried repeatedly
Begging her to one and all aboard this plane
I repeat be discrete but remember
When my head is...Embed
