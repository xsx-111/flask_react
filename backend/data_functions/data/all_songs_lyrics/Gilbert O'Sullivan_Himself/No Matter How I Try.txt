No Matter How I Try LyricsNo matter how I try
I just can't say goodbye
No matter what you say-hey
Looks like I'm here to stay
No matter where I go
I don't know if you know
But everywhere we been
I'm kept in quarantine
It's easy to see why
She's almost six foot five
I'm only five feet two
Is there a tyre somewhere
That may take me as a spare?
Is there a bank in town
That might cash me as a pound?
Is there a place you know
Where I can open the door?
Oh-oh
It's easy to see why
She's almost six foot five
I'm only five feet two
Is there a tyre somwhere
That may take me as a spare?
Is there a bank in town
That might cash me as a pound?
Is there a place you know
Where I can open the door?
Oh-oh
I remember our first anniversary
It was one of those occasions where
Believe you me -
I would rather have been held ransom at the point of a gun
Than to suffer indignation for something I hadn't done
No matter how I try
I just can't say goodbye
No matter what you say-hey
Looks like I'm here to stay-hey
Looks like I'm here to stay
Doo-doo doo-di-doo dooEmbed
