Bullet Soul LyricsOoh, I want to sing one for all the dreamers
Ooh, I'm singing this one for the sparks
Ooh, here's one for the friction makers
Ooh, we are the bleeding hearts
Don't care whoever you are
We rise and fall together
Our hearts still beat below
You can't stand by forever
You're a kid with a bullet soul
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
Ooh, I wanna turn up the radiation
Ooh, I wanna glow in the dark
Ooh, love is the one true innovation
Ooh, love is the only art
Don't let 'em blow it apart!
We rise and fall together
Our hearts still beat below
You can't stand by forever
You're a kid with a bullet soul
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
Oh yeah, you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
Ooh, we are the children of the scar
Ooh, I want to start from the start, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We rise and fall together
Our hearts still beat below
You can't stand by forever
You're a kid with a bullet soul
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
Oh yeah, you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?Embed
