Your Love Is a Song Lyrics
I hear you breathing in
Another day begins
The stars are falling out
My dreams are fading now, fading out

I've been keeping my eyes wide open
I've been keeping my eyes wide open

Ooh, your love is a symphony
All around me
Running through me
Ooh, your love is a melody
Underneath me
Running to me
Your love is a song

The dawn is fire bright
Against the city lights
The clouds are glowing now
The moon is blacking out, it's blacking out

So I've been keeping my mind wide open
I've been keeping my mind wide open, yeah
Ooh, your love is a symphony
All around me
Running through me
Ooh, your love is a melody
Underneath me
Running to me
Oh, your love is a song
Your love is a song
Oh, your love is a song
Your love is strong

With my eyes wide open
I've got my eyes wide open
I've been keeping my hopes unbroken
Yeah, yeah

Ooh, your love is a symphony
All around me
Running through me
Ooh, your love is a melody
Underneath me
Running to me
Your love is a song, yeah, yeah
Your love is my remedy
Oh, your love is a song3Embed
