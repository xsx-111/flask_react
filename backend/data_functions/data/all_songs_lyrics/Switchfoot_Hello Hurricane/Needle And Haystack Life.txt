Needle And Haystack Life Lyrics
In this needle and haystack life

The world begins with new born skin
We are right now
You're a needle girl in a haystack world
We are right now
You're breathing in the highs and lows
We call it living

In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime

Don't let go, don't give up hope
All is forgiven
You're breathing in, you're breathing in
We call it living

In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime
All is not lost, all is not lost
Become who you are
It happens once in a lifetime

In this needle and haystack life
I found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime alive
We are once in a lifetime

In this needle and haystack
We are once in a lifetimeEmbed
