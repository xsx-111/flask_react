Free Lyrics
I've got my back against the wall
But I can still hear the blue sky call
The chains that hold me back inside
Are the prisons of my mind, yeah

Free
Come set me free
Down on my knees
I still believe you can save me from me
Come set me free
Come set me free
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
Inside this shell there's a prison cell

I try to live the light of day
Why would I do what I hate?
But when I try to reach above
I only hurt the ones I love, yeah

Free
Come set me free
Down on my knees
I still believe you can save me from me
Come set me free
Come set me free
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
There's a hole in the neighborhood
Where the shadows fall
There's a hole in my heart, but my hope
Is not in me at all
I had a dream that my chains were
Broken, broken
Broken open

Free
Come set me free
Down on my knees
I still believe you can save me from me
Come set me free
Come set me free
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
Inside this shell there's a prison cellEmbed
