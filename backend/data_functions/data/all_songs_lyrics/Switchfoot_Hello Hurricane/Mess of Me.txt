Mess of Me Lyrics
I am my own affliction
I am my own disease
There ain't no drug that they could sell
No there ain't drug to make me well
There ain't no drug

There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
It's not enough
The sickness is myself

I made a mess of me
I wanna get back the rest of me
I made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I made a mess of me
I wanna get back the rest of me
I made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
The rest of my life alive

They lock our souls in cages
We hide inside our shells
It's hard to free the ones you love
Oh when you can't forgive yourself
Can't forgive yourself
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
The sickness is myself

I made a mess of me
I wanna get back the rest of me
I made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I made a mess of me
I wanna reverse this tragedy
I made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
The rest of my life alive

And there ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
No drug to make me well
There ain't no drug
It's not enough
I'm breaking up
The sickness is myself
The sickness is myself
I made a mess of me
I wanna get back the rest of me
I made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I made a mess of me
I wanna reverse this tragedy
I made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
The rest of my life alive1Embed
