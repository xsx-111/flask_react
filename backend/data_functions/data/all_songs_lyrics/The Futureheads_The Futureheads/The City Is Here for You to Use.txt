The City Is Here for You to Use LyricsI will go to another place, nowhere special just another town
You should come to the other place, make it special and make no loss
Make it special and make mo loss / cover the cost, cover the cost
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost
These extra expenses make brilliant senses
All you have to do is take your chances
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost
These extra expenses make brilliant senses
Extra extra
These are the things that make it better
Are you ready for the city? is the city ready for you?
Dont you know you have to choose? the city is here for you to use
Are you ready for the city? is the city ready for you?
Dont you know you have to choose? the city is here for you to use
Are you ready for the city? is the city ready for you?
Dont you know you have to choose? the city is here for you to use
Oh you have to cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost
Are you ready for the city? city is here for you to use
Is the city ready for you? city is here for you to use
Dont you know you have to choose? city is here for you to use
City is here for you to use, city is here for you to use
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost
Cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the cost, cover the costEmbed
