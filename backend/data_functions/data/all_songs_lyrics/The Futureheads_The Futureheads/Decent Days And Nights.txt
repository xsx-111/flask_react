Decent Days And Nights LyricsThis is a brand new problem
A problem without any clues
If you know the clues
It's easy to get through
But you look confused and you don't know what to do
It's hard to give an answer if you haven't got a clue
If you work it out tell me what you find
If the least you can do is show some restraint
Then the most you can do is get carried away
I can see that you look confused and you don't know what to do
Say what you see
What you like
If you work it out tell me what you find
We can have a few decent days and nights
If you're meant to be here and you want to be late
The best thing you can do is get lost on the way
I can see that you look confused and you don't know what to do
Say what you see
What you like
If you work it out tell me what you find
We can have a few decent days and nights
We can have a few
We can have a few
We can have a few
Decent days and nights
We can have a few
We can have a few
We can have a few
Decent days and nights
If you want to make a guess you should know it's not a game
'Cause you'll never get another chance to make a guess again
This is a brand new problem
A problem without any clues
If you know the clues
It's easy to get through
But you look confused and you don't know what to do
It's hard to give an answer if you haven't got a clue
If you want to make a guess you should know it's not a game
And you'll never get another chance to make a guess again
If you work it out tell me what you findEmbed
