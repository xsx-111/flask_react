First Day LyricsWelcome to your new job, hope you have a wonderful first day
We are so happy to have you join the team, you are so lucky on your first day
And they say
This is the job that people die for, i hope you're ready for the next stage
Alot of people work in the same place, don't let them get in your way
Dinner time you go to the cantine, you make a new friend at the dinner break
You like to talk when you're eating, but today you listen to him
And he says like it or not, you have to do what they say
And it is something that you would like to talk about, but it's only your first day
And they say
This is the job that people die for, i hope you're ready for the next stage
Alot of people work in the same place, don't let them get in your way
And they say faster faster
It's time to take you to the next stage, but it's only your first day
And you're not ready for the next stage
And they say faster faster
It's time to take you to the next stage, and it is something that you would like to talk about
But it's only your first day
(first day), you are so lucky on your first day (first day)
You feel so happy on your first day (fisrt day), you are so lucky on your first day (first day)
This is the job that people die for, i hope you're ready for the next stage
Alot of people work in the same place, don't let them get in your way
Welcome to your new job (first day), hope you have a wonderful first day (first day)
We are so happy to have you join the team (first day), you are so lucky on your first day (first day)
Lucky lucky lucky on your first day (people die for people die for) (x4)Embed
