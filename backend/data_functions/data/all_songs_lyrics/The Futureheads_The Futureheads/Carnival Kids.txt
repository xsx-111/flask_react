Carnival Kids Lyrics
I can't say what they're gonna do
Got your cards marked
And they're coming for you
Gonna kneel down
It's another lonely winter's day
December's coming soon

Gonna need your coat
Gonna cut your throat
Gonna lay you down
(Gonna lay you down, gonna lay you down)
Gonna waste all of your time
(Gonna lay you down, gonna lay you down)

Old enough to know better (ooh ooh ooh)
Don't burn by the fire what goes on inside
When everything is made better (ooh ooh ooh)
The carnival kids will settle, they're laid back in style

I can't say what they're gonna do
Take you to a field in the car boot
Gonna let you go (down, down, down)
Join a freak show
Gonna cut your hair
Gonna lose your mind playing truth or dare
Gonna lay you down
(Gonna lay you down, gonna lay you down)
Gonna waste all of your time
(Gonna lay you down, gonna lay you down)

Old enough to know better (ooh ooh ooh)
Don't burn by the fire what goes on inside
When everything is made better (ooh ooh ooh)
The carnival kids will settle, they're laid back in style

You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enough
You should be
You should be old enough
You should be old enoughEmbed
