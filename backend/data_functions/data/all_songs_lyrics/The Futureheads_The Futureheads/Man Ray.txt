Man Ray LyricsIt gives me Man Ray
It's what we like
It gives me Weston
Touch each other in black and white
Eia eia eieieia
Eia eia eieieia
Eia eia eieieia
Where did your hands go
When you thought I was your life?
I could see his hands
They were touching you all night
And where did your hands go
When you thought I was your life?
I could see his hands
They were touching you all night
Touching you all night night night
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Give me manray
It's what we like
Give me weston
Touch eachother in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and white
Touch yourself, touch yourself, touch each other in black and whiteEmbed
