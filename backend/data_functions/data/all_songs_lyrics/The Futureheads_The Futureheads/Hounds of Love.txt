Hounds of Love LyricsWhen I was a child, running in the night
I was afraid of what might be
Hiding in the dark and hiding on the streets
For and of what was following me
The hounds of love are calling
I've always been a coward
And I don't know what's good for me
Well, here I go
It's coming at me through the tree
Help me, someone, help me, please
And take my shoes off
And I will throw them in the lake
And I will be two steps on the water
I found a fox, caught by dogs
He let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beat so fast
That I am ashamed to be running away
From nothing real, I just can't deal with this
I feel ashamed to be there
Amongst your hounds of loving
I feel your arms surrounding me
I've always been a coward
And I dont know what's good for me
Watch, here I go
Don't let me go, hold me down
It's coming at me through the tree
Help me, someone, help me, please
I don't know what's good for me
I don't know what's good for me
Do you know what I need, do you know what I need?
I need a yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Take my shoes off
And I will throw them in the lake
And I will be two steps on the water
Ooh, I know, I know, I know
I don't know what's good for me
I don't know what's good for me
Do you know what I need, do you know what I need?
I need a yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a he-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
