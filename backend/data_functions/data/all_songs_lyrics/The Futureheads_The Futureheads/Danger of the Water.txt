Danger of the Water LyricsThe beginning of the disaster
Was difficult to spot
The speed of your reaction
Was to slow to make a difference
Far too slow to make it stop
You got everything together
And sailed it down the river
You said it was relaxing
Then you disappeared forever
I can not remember
The times we were together
Perhaps it's just the water
Pulling both of us under
Now there's nothing by the river
But your washed up umbrella
Not enough to make a difference
Not enough to make it stop
It cut through the water as we watched it getting closer
And you said that it would soon fall down the drain
You said it didn't matter but then that is you all over
And the danger of the water meant it wasn't worth the bother
Danger, danger
Water, water
Danger, danger
Water, water
Danger, danger
Water, water
Danger, danger
