Robot LyricsI am a robot
Living like a robot, talk like a robot, in the habititing way
Look up to the sky
Robot
You can trample over me
Robot
I'll do anything you do, now the ground is gone
I am a robot
Living like a robot
Talk like a robot in the habititing way
In the future we all die
Robot
But machines will last forever
Robot
Metal things just turn to rust, when you're a robot
I am a robot
Living like a robot
Talk like a robot in the habititting way
The best thing is our life span
I don't mind
We last nigh on hundred years
I don't mind
If that means we'll be together I don't mind
I have no mind, I have no mind
I'm programmed to follow you
Robot
Do exactly as you do
Robot
While my nervous system's blue, I feel fine
I am a robot
Living like a robot
Talk like a robot in the habititting way
The best thing is our life span
I don't mind
We last nigh on hundred years
I don't mind
If that means we'll be together I don't mind
I have no mind
The best things last a lifetime
I have no mind
When you age I will not change
I have no mind
I think I'll be around forever if you don't mind
I have no mind, why don't I have a mind?
Robot
I have no mind, why don't I have a mind?
Robot
I have no mind, why don't I have a mind?
Robot
I have no mind, why don't I have a mind?1Embed
