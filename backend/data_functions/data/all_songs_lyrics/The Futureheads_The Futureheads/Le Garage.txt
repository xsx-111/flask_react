Le Garage LyricsEverything was ready, but he had to run away
Shot for the money on the very same day
Le garage, le garage-rage
Le garage, le garage-rage
Everything was ready, but he had to run away
Shot for the money on the very same day
Le garage, le garage-rage
Le garage, le garage-rage
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit
You, you are the thing
With your tight skin, making me jealous when you're asleep
And I'm greedy
I never think now when I'm with you
And I won't say a word if it's true
If it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rage
And things pushed in my face
With locked arms, making me muted to everything
You, you give me sound, smashing my strength
I always think now when I'm with you
And I won't say a word if it's true
If it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rage
And I won't say a word if it's true
If it's not true
Le garage, le garage-rageEmbed
