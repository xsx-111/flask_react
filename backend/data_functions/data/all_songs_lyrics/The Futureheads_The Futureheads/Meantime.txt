Meantime LyricsI wasn't laughing properly, when you were talking to me
I didn't find it funny, your story didn't do it for me
False conversations, false conversations
And you thought that I was joking when I said you were a moron
When I said it I was smiling, so you thought that I was joking
It's easy, to try. It's easy, any time
We can talk, if we like
Let's forget it for the meantime
False conversations, a waste of time, false conversations
It's not interesting to have false conversations
You've stolen all your stories and I don't have the patience
It's easy, to try. It's easy, any time
We can talk, if we like
Let's forget it for the meantime
It's easy, to try. It's easy, any time
We can talk, if we like
Let's forget it for the meantime
You are a decent person and you have a function
So why do we say hello? It's just a fashion that we follow that we should be forgetting
But then you do it again, you do the same again
You are a decent person and you have a function
So why do we say hello? It's just a fashion that we follow that we should be forgetting
It's a fashion that we follow that we should be forgetting
It's a fashion that we follow that we should be forgetting
But then you do it again, you do the same again
It's easy, to try. It's easy, any time
We can talk, if we like
Let's forget it for the meantime
It's easy, to try. It's easy, any time
We can talk, if we like
Let's forget it for the meantimeEmbed
