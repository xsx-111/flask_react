He Knows LyricsA girl from our city went missing from her home
People left their houses, people left their homes
He was not invited when he went into her room
He wanted it now, she wanted it soon
He'd love to make a trail out of temperance and guile
But when she told him no, he flashed her a lucky smile
He knows she'd given him all the signs (Say I didn't think so)
He knows she'd given him all the sounds (Say I didn't think so)
He knows he didn't have that much time (Say I didn't think so)
He knows until the body was found (Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
A girl from our city went missing from her home (Oh oh oh oh)
And the people left their houses, and the people left their homes (Oh oh oh oh)
He was not invited when he went into her room
It was just a matter of time, he wanted it now she wanted it soon
It was just a matter of time, and he broke the door down, he broke it in two
It was just a matter of time, and then the family walked out when there was nothing they could do
It was just a matter of time
It was just a matter of time
It was just a matter of time, it was just a matter of time
He knows she'd given him all the signs (Say I didn't think so)
He knows she'd given him all the sounds (Say I didn't think so)
He knows he didn't have that much time (Say I didn't think so)
He knows until the body was found (Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
And the authorities weren't pleased when they couldn't bring her home
It was just a matter of time
It was just a matter of time
It was a terrible thing to do, it was just a matter of time
It was a terrible thing to do
It was just a matter of time
It was just a matter of time
It was just a matter of time, it was just a matter of time
It was just a matter of time
It was just a matter of time(Do you really think so?)
It was just a matter of time (Do you really think so?)
It was just a matter of time (Do you really think so?)Embed
