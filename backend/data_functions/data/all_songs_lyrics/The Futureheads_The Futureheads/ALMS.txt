ALMS LyricsYou wasted it
You fell asleep
It was not late
You missed the point
You wasted it
You fell asleep
It was not late
You missed the point
You wasted it
You fell asleep
It was not late
You missed the point
You thought that you could disappear
You thought it easier to be here
You thought that you could disappear
You thought it easier to be here
You wasted it
You fell asleep
It was not late
You missed the point
Don't ask me for alms
Don't ask me for alms
Don't ask me to follow you anywhere
Don't ask me for alms
All aboard at port b
Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry
All aboard at port b
Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry
When you get to port c you'll be happy
When you get to port c you'll be happy
Happy happy happy happy happy happy happy no
Don't put me in your arms
Don't put me in your arms
Don't ask me to follow you anywhere
Don't ask me for alms
Don't ask me for alms
Don't ask me for alms
Don't ask me for alms
Don't ask me for almsEmbed
