Trying Not to Think About Time LyricsOne thing or another's always getting in the way
Of this and it's what we do, of this and it's what we do
Wasting time and money's so much sicker than you think
Especially when it's you, especially when it's you
Stopping all the clocks, I'm trying not to think about time
It's all a game of number and who says that they won't lie?
Look at what they made us do, look at what they made us do
How can you be abstract if you're always on the brink
Of finding out something new, finding out something new
I'm taking off my watch
I'm trying not to think about time
First thing it's the money, after a while it's my health
My health, my health, my health, my health
Nights and days and hours doesn't seem to be much help
Much help, much help, much help, much help
You need to sort this problem out
It's going to take a while, gonna take a while
One thing or another's always getting in the way
Getting in the way, getting in the way
Spending time and money's so much quicker than you think
Quicker than you think, quicker than you think
It's all a game of number and who says that they won't lie?
They won't lie
How can you be abstract if you're always on the brink
Of finding something new, finding something new
There's no time time, there's no time time
First thing it's the money, after a while it's my health
My health, my health, my health, my health
Nights and days and hours doesn't seem to be much help
Much help, much help, much help, much help
You need to sort this problem out
It's going to take a while, gonna take a whileEmbed
