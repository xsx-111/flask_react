Slide Lyrics
Even on a day like this
When you're crawling on the floor
Reaching for the phone to ring
Anyone who knows you anymore

It's all right to make mistakes, you're only human
Inside everybody's hiding something

Staring at the same four walls
Have you tried to help yourself?
Rings around your eyes, they don't hide
That you need to get some rest

It's all right to make mistakes, you're only human
Inside everybody's hiding something
Take time to catch your breath and choose your moment
Don't slide

Don't slide, don't slide
Don't slide, slide, slide
Even at a time like this
When the morning seems so far
Think that pain belongs to you
But it's happened to us all



You bought this on yourself
And it's high time you left it there
Lie here and rest your head
Dream of something else instead
