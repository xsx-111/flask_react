Honestly OK Lyrics
I just want to feel safe in my own skin
I just want to be happy again
I just want to feel deep in my own world

But I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore

On a different day if I was safe in my own skin
Then I wouldn't feel lost and so frightened
But this is today and I'm lost in my own skin

And I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore
And I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore
And I'm so lonely I don't even wanna be with myself anymore

I just want to feel safe in my own skin
I just want to be happy againEmbed
