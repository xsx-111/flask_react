Worthless Lyrics
I know what you came for
And I know when you'll leave
You came for my heart
And it's lost to me

For I won't stop you
I will open my door
My heart is here waiting
I don't need it no more

I know why you're leaving
And I'll just let it be
I am left with nothing
And now you're lost to me

For I can't stop you
I will open my door
My heart is here waiting
I don't need it no more

For love makes a fool of me
For love makes a clown of us
(Yes it does, yes it does, yes it does)
You know, it's worthless as worthless can be
I know what you came for
And I know when you'll leave
You came for my heart
And it's lost to me
