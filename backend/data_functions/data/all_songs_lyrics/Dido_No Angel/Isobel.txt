Isobel Lyrics
I thought it was funny when you missed the train
When I rang you at home they said you'd left yesterday
I thought it was strange when your car was found
By the tree in Ennis where we used to hang around

Dear Isobel, I hope you're well
And what you've done is right
Oh, it's been such hell, I wish you well
I hope you're safe tonight
It's been a long day coming
And long will it last when it's last day leaving
I'm helping it pass by loving you more

And who he would become
All the things he'd have done?
Would he have loved you and not let you down?
And would he be stronger than his father?
Don't punish yourself, leave it well alone

Dear Isobel, I hope you're well
And what you've done is right
Oh, it's been such hell, I wish you well
I hope you're safe tonight
It's been a long day coming
And long will it last when it's last day leaving
I'm helping it pass by loving you more
It's been a long day coming
And long will it last when it's last day leaving
I'm helping it pass by loving, loving you moreEmbed
