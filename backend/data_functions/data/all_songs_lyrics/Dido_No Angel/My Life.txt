My Life Lyrics
What I choose to do
Is of no concern to you
And your friends
Where I lay my hat
May not be my home
But I will last on my own

Cause it's me and my life
It's my life (it's my life)

Oh, the world has sat
In the palm of my hand
Not that you'd see
And I'm tired and bored
Of waiting for you
And all those things you never do

Cause it's me and my life
It's my life, it's my lifeEmbed
