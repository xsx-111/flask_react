Take My Hand Lyrics
Touch my skin and tell me what your thinking
Take my hand and show me where we're going
Lie down next to me, look into my eyes and tell me
Oh, tell me what you're seeing

So sit on top of the world and tell me how you're feeling

What you feel is what I feel for you
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone, if I'm lying to you

See my eyes, they carry your reflection
Watch my lips and hear the words I'm telling you
Give your trust to me and look into my heart
And show me, and show me what you're doing

So sit on top of the world and tell me how you're feeling

What you feel is what I feel for you
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone, if I'm lying to you
Take your time and if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
You believe me, you believe me
You believe me
Feel the sun on your face
And tell me what you're thinking
Catch the snow on your tongue
And show me how it tastes

Take your time
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone, if I'm lying to you
Take your time and if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
Take my hand and if I'm lying to you
I'll always be alone, if I'm lying to you
Take your time and if I'm lying to you
I know you'll find that you believe me
You believe me, you believe me
You believe me, you believe me
You believe meEmbed
