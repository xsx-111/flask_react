After the Moon Lyrics
Daydream the whole night through
Believe me, the sun will get you too
The distance to the next star
Is less than the one between our hearts
I'm trying to build a bridge
As purple light silhouettes the ridge
Daydream the whole night through
Trust me, the moon will abandon you

Over and over, you turn that same key
Try to dream a dream for me
Just let the movie play out in your head
Till it fades to white

I know it's hard to see
I ask you put your trust in me
I'll see the long night through
And I'll still be here after the moon

Over and over, you turn that same key
Try to dream a dream for me
Just let the movie play out in your head
Till it fades to white
