Saturday Lyrics

I was born on a Saturday
What about you?
You know, I already know that you were too
I woke up on a screened-in porch in a rainstorm
I won't hold fast, you're waiting past I take no form

A strong current will sweep you downstream
It would be best not to resist
The line you're hanging on is fraying
You may as well loosen your grip

When a stranger is living in your old house
What does when you were born still say about you?
It'd be best to jettison what you can't redo

A strong current will sweep you downstream
It would be best not to resist
The line you're hanging on is fraying
You may as well loosen your grip
