Diamond Eyes LyricsIt's a time to be humble, it's a time to be free
It's a time to raise our voices loud and not go quietly
As this time marches on into great uncertainty
I have music all around me bringing timeless melody
There's a tide in the water
Where the mountains reach the sea
And the lilac grows beyond the scope of forgotten memory
Just as simple and as strange as the sea becomes the tree
There are people shouting clearly "I am you and you are me"
Oh, these times we share as this time will end
To be sure it will not come again
Just timeless myths, on her you can depend
It's a time to be humble, it's a time to be free
It's a time to raise our voices loud and not go quietly
Where the sky meets the shoreline and the mountains meet the sea
I have music all around me bringing timeless melody
Diamond eye will not go quietly
Diamond eye will not go quietly
Diamond eye will, diamond eye will, diamond eye will not go quietlyEmbed
