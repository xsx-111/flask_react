Holding Pattern Lyrics
Six o'clock, the crickets stop
The sky fills up with light
Was it the rain or a southbound train
That woke me up last night?
It's just this game, makes me insane
I wonder where we're going
Clear a path for earth to pass
I just wish we could stop

Around in circles
Far from the ground
Waiting to put this thing down

Where was I Tuesday night?
Where was I this morning
What this is is not real life
At least it isn't boring
I can't open my mouth to speak
I can't open my eyes
Someone press pause, wrap me in gauze
And turn the lights off

Around in circles
Far from the ground
Waiting to put this thing down

Around in circles
Far from the ground
Waiting to put this thing down

Whoa, oh, waiting to put this thing downEmbed
