Time LyricsAll my eyes are open wide
I bet my life on this
But I can see the rising tide
Its kind of hard to miss
But you know I speak reluctantly
Terrified that the one to blame is me
I have not lost the plot just yet
I have reason to believe
The sun's still burning
Up there in the sky, there's time
If I cannot be careful
I'll forget what I'm here for
And if I cannot be patient
I don't think that I'll make it
And you know I speak reluctantly
Time to not turn your back on me
I have not lost the plot just yet
I have reason to believe
The sun's still burning
Up there in the sky, I won't
Ask whyEmbed
