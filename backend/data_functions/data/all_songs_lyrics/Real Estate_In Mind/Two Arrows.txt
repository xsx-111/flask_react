Two Arrows Lyrics
Two flashlights out in the night will get you home
Walking under the night's punctured dawn
I know we're bound to leave this town
There's other there
Although I know we go, I know not where

The sky was wild with circumstance
The ground littered with chance
I'll meet you in the morning
Beyond that, I've got no plans

Our fates move like two arrows
Through space and through time
Our lives, they form a blacktop
With two straight yellow lines
There is no hesitation
None that I can find
When I turn to look over the mode we've left behind

The sky was wild with circumstance
The ground littered with chance
I'll meet you in the morning
Beyond that, I've got no plans
I know we're bound to leave this town
There's other there
Although I know we go, I know not where
