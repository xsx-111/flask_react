Same Sun LyricsTried to pass myself
My accent won't help
I can't fool no one
I'm no native son
Just on holiday, anyway
There will always be a trace of this place in me
When does one thing ever end and the next begin?
Every day back then felt like a hyphen
I cannot recall where I was at all
But I know what I heard when I wrote those words
"Green River" still runs under that same sun
I never saw the source but I know the chorus
When does one thing ever end and the next begin?
Every day back then felt like a hyphen
I do not wish to retrace the steps I've taken
All that matters now is where I'm going
There will always be a trace of this place in me
"Green River" still runs under that same sunEmbed
