White Light Lyrics
White light in the morning
Yellow afternoon
Golden in the evening when you come home when you do
Play my song so softly
In a room without a view
I just wish I had some place else to move
To tell you the truth

Other people get around
Constantly passing underground
I can hear that awful sound
How other people get around

It's unrelenting beam
On the one and on the three
That same tide that pulls you out
Each day will bring you back to me

Other people get around
Constantly passing underground
I can hear that awful sound
How other people get aroundEmbed
