Darling Lyrics
The black and yellow finches
That nest in our new ferns
Which hang upon our front porch
Wait for the warm sun to return

Impatiently, as I wait for you
Impatiently, as I wait for you

The night surrenders swiftly
The moon retreats from sight
The darkness that surrounds me
The sun cuts like a knife to shine

Impatiently
Impatiently

The birds singing
The sun rising
Impatiently

As I wait for you
For you, for you, for you7Embed
