Inner Garden II Lyrics
Rome now comes to sit
In her garden
Mingling the breeze with memories
Of a time when
There was a room in pale yellow hues
Her room with a view
Where love made a bed of happiness
In muslin and lace

Sweet is the voice from far away
That speaks sotto voce
And is lingering there in the golden air
To quiet the dayEmbed
