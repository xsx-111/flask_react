People Lyrics
People fly, people flee
People clam and say "it wasn't me"
People fish, people beef
People armed to the teeth
Yes, you've got people on the tube
Walking on the moon
People at the bottom of the sea
People in tombs, and people in igloos
And even a tribe of pygmies

Ooh, people are the main spring
Turning the world around
Ooh, people, they're the main spring
Spinning this world upside down

People sun, people toast
People tire while other people smoke
People bowl, people rock
People pay to see two people box
Watch me, face me
Dress me, baby me
Phone me, wire me
House me, bug me, fire me
Ooh, people are the main spring
Spinning the world around
Ooh, people, they're the main spring
Turning this world inside out

Face me
Fire me
Baby me

Ooh, people are the main spring
Turning the world around
Ooh, people, they're the main spring
Spinning this world up-
Upside down
People, they're the main spring
Spinning the world around
People are the main spring
Spinning this world upside down


People are the main springEmbed
