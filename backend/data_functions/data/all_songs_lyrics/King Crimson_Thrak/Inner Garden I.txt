Inner Garden I Lyrics
Autumn has come to rest
In her garden
Come to paint the trees with emptiness
And no pardon
So many things have come undone
Like the leaves on the ground
And suddenly she begins to cry
But she doesn't know why

Heavy are the words that fall through the air
To burden her shoulders
Caught up in the trees, her soliloquy
"Don't leave me alone"Embed
