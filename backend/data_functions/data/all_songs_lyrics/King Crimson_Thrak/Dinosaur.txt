Dinosaur Lyrics
Long ago and far away in a different age
When I was a dumb young guy
Fossilized photos of my life then
Illustrate what an easy prey I must have been

Standing in the sun, idiot savant
Something like a monument

I'm a dinosaur, somebody's digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur, somebody's digging my bones

Ignorance has always been something I excel in
Followed by naivet√© and pride
Doesn't take a scientist to see how
Any clever predator could have a piece of me

Standing in the sun, idiot savant
Something like a monument

I'm a dinosaur, somebody's digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
Oh, when I look back on the past
Some wonder I'm not yet extinct
All the mistakes and bad judgements I made
Nearly pushed me to the brink
It doesn't pay to be too nice
It's the one thing I have learned
Still, I made my fossil bed
And now I toss and turn

I'm a dinosaur, somebody's digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur


I'm a dinosaur, somebody's digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur, somebody's digging my bones1Embed
