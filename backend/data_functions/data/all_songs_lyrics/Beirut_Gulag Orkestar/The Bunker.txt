The Bunker LyricsAnd I'd sooner go, I'd sooner go than fade away
Oh, my city's there, my city's gone, I'll stay away
And I'd sooner go, I'd sooner go than fade away
Oh, my city's died, my city's gone, I'll stay away
And I'd sooner go, I'd sooner go than fade away
Oh, my city's there, my city's gone, I'll stay away
And I'd sooner go, I'd sooner go than fade away
Oh, my city's died, my city's gone, I'll stay awayEmbed
