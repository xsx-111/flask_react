Mount Wroclai (Idle Days) LyricsAnd I know Winter will pass by slow
Without my heart, what can I do?
You're in the halls, the bell gives way to a larger swell
Without my heart, what can I do?
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
And we grow fat on the charms of our idle dreary days
Seen the shadows grow, see an ominous display
With no alarm, could we say we'd have expected this way?
Our desires have died; give incent to play
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
Mount Wroclai
