Rhineland (Heartland) LyricsLife, life is all right on the Rhine
No, but I know, but I know
I would have no where to go
No but there's nowhere to go, to go
Life, life is all right on the Rhine
No, but I know, but I know
I would have no where to go
No but there's nowhere to go, to go
Life, life is all right on the Rhine
No, but I know, but I know
Life, life is all right on the Rhine
No, but I know, but I know
I would have no where to go
No but there's nowhere to go, to go2Embed
