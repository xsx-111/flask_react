Brandenburg LyricsSend me now, the winter's over
A light turns out, the winds are colder
The love we've had will turn all over
Going south and we are older
On the one time I told you also
On a night like this you all turn around
No but I, I won't have you anymore
No and I, I can't have you anymore
And some days we're all alone on the banks of the Rhine
And some days all we have was worth while
And some sing dreams of spears chosen once in life
And some days we're all alone on the banks of the RhineEmbed
