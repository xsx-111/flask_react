Lost Someone LyricsI lost someone
A million to one
Ten thousand people
Under my thumb
Someone, the one, my one
The only one
That's the someone
The someone
The only one
That someone
That I lost
Nothing but a stranger
Come on home to me
I'm so weak on my knees
Help me, help me please
Please, please
Good God almighty I love you
I lost someone
One trillion to one
A million people
Under the big old sun I see
My one on the street
Looking like a bum
That's my one
That's my someone
He's the one
He's
Help that one
He's nothing but a stranger
Bring him home to me
He's so weak on both his bended knees
Can you help me? Help me please
Gee whiz, I miss the one that I need
I lost someoneEmbed
