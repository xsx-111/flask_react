I Believe in You LyricsThey ask me how I feel and if my love is real
And how I seem to think that I know I'm gonna make it through
They looked at me and frowned, they drove me from this town
They don't want me around 'cause I believe
They showed me to the door, they said "don't come back no more"
"We don't like the way you think you do"
So I walked out on my own one thousand miles from home
But I don't feel alone 'cause I believe
(I believe in you)
I believe in you even through the all tears and laughter
I believe in you even though we're apart
I believe in you even on the morning after
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
And when the night is disappearing
This feeling will still be here in my heart
Please don't let me drift too far
Keep me safe and sane where you are
So I can always be renewed
And what you've given me here today
Is worth everything I could pay
No matter what everyone will say
'Cause I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe in you
I believe in you when we've had no time together
I believe in you when white turns to black
I believe in you even though we'll all be outnumbered
Oh, the earth will be shakin'
And friends will be forsaken
Please, we can't go back
I believe in youEmbed
