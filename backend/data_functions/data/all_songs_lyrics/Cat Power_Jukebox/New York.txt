New York LyricsStart spreadin' the news
I'm leavin' today
I want to be a part of it
New York, New York
These vagabond shoes
Are longin' to stray
Right through the very heart of it
New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city that doesn't sleep
To find I'm cream of the crop and top of the heap
These little-town blues
Are meltin' away
I'll make a brand-new start of it
Oh, in New York
If I can make it there
I'll make it anywhere
New York
It's up to you
New YorkEmbed
