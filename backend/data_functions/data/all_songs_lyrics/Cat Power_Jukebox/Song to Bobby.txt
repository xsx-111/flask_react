Song to Bobby LyricsI wanna tell you
I've always wanted to tell you
But I never had the chance to say
What I feel in my heart from the beginning till my dying day
I was fifteen, sixteen maybe
In the park I was waving my arms
You were wet with sweat
And you sang the song that I was screaming
I wanted you too
Another time was in South Carolina
It's always been the third encore
Whose wind came blowing in
Can you tell me who were you singing for?
Oh my God, can you tell me who you were singing to?
A phone call from your New York City office
You were supposedly asking to see me
And how I wanted to tell you
That I was just only four hundred miles away
Who could believe that you were calling
I was in DC, I was four hundred miles behind
Backstage pass in my hand
Giving you my heart was my plan
I wish I could tell you
My chance
In the middle of the stadium in Paris, France
Can I finally tell you?
Can I finally tell you?
To be my man
April in Paris, can I see you?
Can you please be my man?Embed
