Blue LyricsBlue, songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away
Blue, there is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in
Well, there's so many sinking
Now you gotta keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that
Hell's the hippest way to go
Well, I don't think so, but I'll take a look around it, though
Blue, I love you
Blue, here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your from me
