Fortunate Son LyricsSome folks are born made to wave the flag
Ooh, the red, white and blue
And when the band plays "Hail to the Chief"
They point the cannon right at you, Lord
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no senator's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand
Ah, they really help themselves
But when the tax man comes to the door
Lord, the house look a rummage sale, oh yeah
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no
Some folks inherit star-spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war
And when you ask them, "How much should I give?"
Oh, they only answer, "More"
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no military son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no
It ain't me, it ain't me, no
It ain't me, it'll never be me
I ain't no fortunate one, noEmbed
