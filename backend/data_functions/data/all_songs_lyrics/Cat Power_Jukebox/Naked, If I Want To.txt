Naked, If I Want To Lyrics
Would you let me walk down your street
Naked if I wanted to?
Can I fly fireworks on the fourth
Of every single July?
Can I buy an amplifier on time?
My sweet time

Well, I ain't got no money
I will pay this time
And I ain't got no money
But I will pay you before I die

And would you let me walk down your streets
Naked if we all wanted to?
And can I fly fireworks on the fourth
Of every single July?
And can I buy an aeroplane
Way up high in the old blue sky?

Well, I ain't got no mercy
I will pay this time
And I ain't got no mercy
I will pay you before I dieEmbed
