Woman Left Lonely LyricsA woman left lonely
Will soon grow tired of waiting
She'll do crazy things
On lonely occasions
A simple conversation
With a strange man now and again
Makes a touchy situation
With her conscience now and then
And when she gets lonely
She's thinkin' 'bout her man
She knows he's takin' her for granted
And she just don't understand
Well, the fevers of the night
They burn an unloved woman
All those red-hot flames
Drive a sweet temptation
A woman left lonely
She's just the victim of her man
He can't keep up his own world
She does the best that she can
And a woman left lonely
Is lonely through and through
All along she conquers
All the hell he put her through
A woman left lonely
A woman left lonely
She's just a victim of her man
She gets tired waiting
All alone she's just waitingEmbed
