Coming Clean Lyrics
Seventeen, and strung out on confusion
Trapped inside a role of disillusion

I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand

Secrets collecting dust, but never forget
Skeletons come to life in my closet

I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand
What's happening to me

Oh-oh-oh

Seventeen, and coming clean for the first time
I finally figured out myself for the first time

I've found out what it takes to be a man
Well, Mom and Dad'll never understand
What's happening to me17Embed
