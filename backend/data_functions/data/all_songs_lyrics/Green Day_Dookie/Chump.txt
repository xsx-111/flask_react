Chump Lyrics
I don't know you, but I think I hate you
You're the reason for my misery
Strange how you've become my biggest enemy
And I've never even seen your face

Well maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb

You're the cloud hanging out over my head
And hail comes crashing down, welting my face
Magic man, egocentric plastic man
Yet you still got one over on me

Well maybe it's just jealousy
Mixing up with a violent mind
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense
Or maybe I'm just dumb
I'm a chump!
