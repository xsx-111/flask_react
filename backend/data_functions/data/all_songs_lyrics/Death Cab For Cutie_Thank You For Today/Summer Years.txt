Summer Years Lyrics
Sometimes I wake at night
And watch the rain fall through the street lights
'Cause you're standing still in my mind
Fading out, waving goodbye

And I wonder where you are tonight
If the one you're with was a compromise
As we're walking lines in parallel
That will never meet and it's just as well

Sometimes I'm overcome
By every choice I couldn't outrun
The junctions all disappear
You can't double back to your summer years

And I wonder where you are tonight
If the one you're with was a compromise
As we're walking lines in parallel
That will never meet and it's just as well
And I wonder where you are tonight
If the one you're with was a compromise
As we're walking lines in parallel
That will never meet and it's just as well
It's just as well

And I wonder where you are tonight
If the one you're with was a compromise
As we're walking lines in parallel
That will never meet and it's just as well
And I wonder where you are tonight
If the one you're with was a compromise
As we're walking lines in parallel
That will never meet and it's just as well
It's just as well1Embed
