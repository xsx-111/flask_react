You Moved Away Lyrics
You sold your records by the pile
For they were only yours for a while
You placed your furniture in the yard
And it was gone within the hour

When you moved away
All your friends came over and you told them what to take
When you moved away
Everyone thought it was a mistake

You mopped the floors and filled the cracks
To get your security deposit back
You closed your account at the bank
You checked your tires and filled the tank

When you moved away
All of your friends got drunk and one by one begged you to stay
When you moved away
They all felt irrationally betrayed

Since you moved away
I walk past your vacant apartment almost every day
When you moved away
You left this town with such an empty spaceEmbed
