When We Drive Lyrics
I can't expect you to be honest
Or to be faithful every day 'til the end
I just need you to be always a friend
As the sun sets over Dakotas
Underneath a crimson ocean of sky
Know I'll always want you by my side

When we drive
When we drive

You and I were born in motion
Never in one place for too long a time
And now it's the only way we know to survive
I like the way that your hair tangles
The way your sun tan's only on one side
We always keep the windows open wide

When we drive
When we drive

Climb into the back seat and close your eyes
I've got the wheel
And dream of all the places only we will find
I can't expect you to be honest
Or to be faithful every day 'til the end
I just need you to be always a friend
Until the engine kicks and sputters
Until we roll the rubber off the tires
Know I'll always need you by my side

When we drive
When we drive2Embed
