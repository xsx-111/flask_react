Gold Rush Lyrics
(Gold rush) Digging for gold in my neighborhood
(Gold rush) Where all the old buildings stood
(Gold rush) And they keep digging it down and down
(Gold rush) So that their cars can live underground
(Gold rush) The swinging of a wrecking ball
(Gold rush) Through these lath and plaster walls
(Gold rush) Is letting all the shadows free
(Gold rush) The ones I wish still followed me

(Change) Followed me, followed me
(Please don't change)
(Stay) Followed me, followed me
(Stay the same)

(Gold rush) I remember a winter's night
(Gold rush) We kissed beneath the street lamp light
(Gold rush) Outside our bar near the record store
(Gold rush) That have been condos for a year and more
(Gold rush) Now that our haunts have taken flight
(Gold rush) And been replaced with construction sites
(Gold rush) Oh, how I feel like a stranger here
(Gold rush) Searching for something that's disappeared
(Gold rush) Digging for gold in my neighborhood
(Gold rush) For what they say is the greater good
(Gold rush) But all I see is a long goodbye
(Gold rush) A requiem for a skyline
(Gold rush) It seems I never stopped losing you
(Gold rush) As every dive becomes something new
(Gold rush) And all our ghosts get swept away
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way

(Change) Be this way, be this way
(Please don't change)
(Stay) Be this way, be this way
(Stay the same)
(Cranes) Be this way, be this way
(Devour the light)
(Strange) Be this way, be this way
(Appetite)

I've ascribed these monuments
A false sense of permanence
I've placed faith in geography
To hold you in my memory
(Gold rush) I'm sifting through these wreckage piles
(Gold rush) Through the rubble of bricks and wires
(Gold rush) Looking for something I'll never find
(Gold rush) Looking for something I'll never find
(Gold rush) Digging for gold in my neighborhood
(Gold rush) Where all the old buildings stood
(Gold rush) And they keep digging it down and down
(Gold rush) So that their cars can live underground
(Gold rush) It seems I never stopped losing you
(Gold rush) As every dive becomes something new
(Gold rush) And all our ghosts get swept away
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way

Change
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
Please don't change
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
Stay, stay the same
(Gold rush)
It didn't use to be this way
(Gold rush)
It didn't use to be this way
Stay the same
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
(Gold rush) It didn't use to be this way
Change
(Gold rush)
(Gold rush)
Please don't change
(Gold rush)
(Gold rush)
Stay
(Gold rush)
(Gold rush)
Stay the same2Embed
