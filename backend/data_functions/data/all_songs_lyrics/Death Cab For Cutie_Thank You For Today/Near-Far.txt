Near/Far Lyrics
You flicker like a fluorescent light
An intermittent strobe in a lonely night
As I am standing by your side
Trying to breach this dark and deep divide

You're here
So far away
So near
So far

I hear you talking to yourself
Cursing every card you wanted dealt
But I can't help you play your hand
If you mistake every word for a command
You're here

So far away
So near
So far away

You're here
So far away
So near
So far
You flicker like a fluorescent light
An intermittent strobe in a lonely night
But I won't watch you burning out
I won't let you be the one I live without

You're here
So far away
So near
So far2Embed
