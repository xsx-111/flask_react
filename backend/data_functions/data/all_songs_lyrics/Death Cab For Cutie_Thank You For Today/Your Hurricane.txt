Your Hurricane Lyrics
Heaven is a hole in the sky
The stars are cracks in the ceiling of night
And I just keep watching them for a sign
That you'll be alright
'Cause every time there's a knock on my door
I fall to my hands and knees on the floor
'Cause when your wreckage washes up on my shore
You're not like before

And you try to explain who's at fault for your mistakes
But I won't be the debris in your hurricane

You used to be such a delicate kid
A lonely fish in a sea full of squid
So I can't blame you for leaving how you did
You just fell off the grid
'Cause heaven is a hole in the sky
And the stars are cracks in the ceiling of night
But you can't be your own alibi
As hard as you try
It's a tired refrain you're singing over and over again
As you try to explain who's at fault for your mistakes
But I won't be the debris in your hurricane (x3)2Embed
