Ophelia LyricsBoards on the window, mail by the door
What would anybody leave so quickly for?
Ophelia
Where have you gone?
The old neighborhood just ain't the same
Nobody knows just what became of
Ophelia
Tell me, what went wrong

Was it something that somebody said?
Mama, I know we broke the rules
Was somebody up against the law?
Honey, you know I'd die for you
Ashes of laughter, the ghost is clear
Why do the best things always disappear
Like Ophelia
Please darken my door

Was it something that somebody said?
Honey, you know we broke the rules
Was somebody up against the law?
Honey, you know I'd die for you
They got your number, scared and running
But I'm still waiting for the second coming
Of Ophelia
Come back home
