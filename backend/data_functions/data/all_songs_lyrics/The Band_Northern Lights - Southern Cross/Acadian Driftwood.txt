Acadian Driftwood Lyrics
The war was over and the spirit was broken
The hills were smokin' as the men withdrew
We stood on the cliffs and watched the ships
Slowly sinking to their rendezvous

They signed a treaty and our homes were taken
Loved ones forsaken, they didn't give a damn
Try to raise a family, end up an enemy
Over what went down on the Plains of Abraham

Acadian driftwood, gypsy tailwind
They call my home the land of snow
Canadian cold front movin' in
What a way to ride, oh what a way to go

Then some returned to the motherland
The high command had them cast away
Some stayed on to finish what they started
They never parted, they're just built that way

We had kin livin' south of the border
They're a little older and they been around
They wrote in a letter life is a whole lot better
So pull up your stakes, children, and come on down
Acadian driftwood, gypsy tailwind
They call my home the land of snow
Canadian cold front movin' in
What a way to ride, oh what a way to go

Fifty under zero when the day became a threat
My clothes were wet and I was drenched to the bone
Then out ice fishin', too much repetition
Make a man want to leave the only home he's known

Sailed out of the Gulf, headed for St. Pierre
Nothing to declare, all we had was gone
Broke down along the coast, what hurt the most
When the people there said, "you better keep movin' on"

Acadian driftwood, gypsy tailwind
They call my home the land of snow
Canadian cold front movin' in
What a way to ride, oh what a way to go

Everlastin' summer filled with ill-contempt
This government had us walkin' in chains
This isn't my turn, this isn't my season
Can't think of one good reason to remain
We worked in the sugar fields up from New Orleans
It was evergreen up until the flood
You could call it an omen, point you where you're goin'
Set my compass North, I got winter in my blood

Acadian driftwood, gypsy tailwind
They call my home the land of snow
Canadian cold front movin' in
What a way to ride, oh what a way to go

Sais tu, Acadie j'ai le mal du pays
Ta neige, Acadie, fait des larmes au soleil
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo
J'arrive Acadie, teedle um, teedle um, teedle oo1Embed
