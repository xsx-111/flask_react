Ring Your Bell LyricsRing your bell, change your number
Run like hell, you can't hide from thunder, oh no
Ring your bell, get in the wind
You and me gonna make some medicine
Run that rebel across the tracks
With the Mounties on his trail
He was taught, don't get caught at the mercy of the man
Land in jail
Meet me, madam, on the high road
We gonna blow the man down
I've been totin' a heavy load and I'm rarin' to clown
Mess around
Ring your bell, shake your tower
Pump your well, turn on your power
I'm gonna ring your bell, slide on in
You and me gonna make some medicine
Smoky bars and souped-up cars
Where we drowned all sorrow
Renegade woman, love me like there's no tomorrow
Left to borrow
Bloodhounds comb the back streets
With the ramrod close behind
Ask for justice, you gonna find my ass across
That border line
Ring your bell, sound the chimes
Open up your shell, get on the line
Come on, ring your bell, gimme some skin
You and me gonna make some medicineEmbed
