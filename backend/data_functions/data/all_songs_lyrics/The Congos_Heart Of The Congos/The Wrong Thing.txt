The Wrong Thing LyricsAll they do, they just pray
And they cry every day, ya
All they do, they just pray
And they sigh more and more
Every day my people going to the church
Yet the living seems worser than worse
They talk about Marcus Garvey prophecy
Yet they don't know their own history
All they do, they just say
The wrong thing all over
All they do, they just think
The wrong thing all over
Talk about the troubles, brother bear
With my brethren we all will share
Equality and justice stands for all
Who know that Satan your kingdom must fall
Fire, lightning, thunder a go burn you, Babel
Don't matter where you hide
You can't hide, from the wrong that you have done
You a go back up pan yourself
Every day my people going to the church
Yet the living seems worser than worse
They talk about Marcus Garvey prophecy
Yet they don't know their own history
All they do, they just say
The wrong thing all over
All they do, they just say
The wrong thing all over
They talk about Marcus Garvey prophecy
Yet they don't know their own history
Oh yeah, na na na na
You can't hide from the wrong...Embed
