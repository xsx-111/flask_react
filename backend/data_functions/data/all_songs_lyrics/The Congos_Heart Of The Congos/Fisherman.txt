Fisherman Lyrics
Row, fisherman, row
Keep on rowing your boat (Brotherman, brotherman)
Yeah, row, fisherman, row
Lots of hungry belly pickney, they a shore (Millions of them)
Lots of hungry belly pickney, they a shore

Living in a bamboo hut (In a little old sea-port town)
Three kids on the floor (And another one to come make four)
Day, day by day (I man step it along the sea shore)
Day, day by day (I man step it along the sea shore)
Hail, brother John, have you got any wenchman
Yes, brother Peter (Wenchman, sprat and mackaba)
Yes, brother Peter (Wenchman, sprat and mackaba)

Row, fisherman, row
Keep on rowing your boat (Brotherman, brotherman)
Yeah, row, fisherman, row
We've got to reach aon higher ground

Row, fisherman, row
Keep on rowing your boat (Brotherman, brotherman)
Yeah, row, fisherman, row

Come a shore to feed the hungry belly ones
Simon, Peter, James and John
Come a shore to feed the hungry belly one

So, Row, fisherman, row
Keep on rowing your boat (Brotherman, brotherman)
Yeah, row, fisherman, row
Lots of hungry belly pickney, they a shore (Millions of them)
Lots of hungry belly pickney, they a shore
