Open Up the Gate LyricsOpen up the gates of Zion
Africa we want to go
Africa we want to go
Repatriation is, at hand
I and I know where the black man stands
I and I know where the black man stands
To the west coast of Africa
East, north and south
Repatriation is, a must of Ion
Repatriation is, a must
Jah said unto the south 'give up!' (give up!)
To the west 'keep not back!' (not back!)
Send my sons from afar
And my daughters from the end of the world
Send my sons from afar
And my daughters from the end of the world
Hallelujah!
Please, send the Father
The Almighty One of Creation, in man
Living inna man yah
The Mighty Redeemer
The Word, Sound and Iwa
Living inna man yah
Ooh, Hallelujah!
Listen to Father
The Almighty, the Bongo Ashanti, aah I, aah I
Living inna I and I
Mighty, Mighty Redeemer of Creation, ah yeah
To the west coast of Africa
East, north and south
Repatriation is, a must of Ion
Repatriation is, a must of Ion
Jah said unto the south 'give up!' (give up!)
To the west 'keep not back!' (not back!)
Send my sons from afar
And my daughters from the end of the world
Send my sons from afar
And my daughters from the end of the worldEmbed
