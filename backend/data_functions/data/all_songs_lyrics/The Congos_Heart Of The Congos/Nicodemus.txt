Nicodemus LyricsIt's a long long..
Free up Jah Jah children
Mek dem run home a yard
Free up Jah Jah children
Mek dem run home a yard
A yard.. a yard..
Now it's a long long time we a gwaan sah
I never get weary yeah, oh no!
Now it's a long long time we a gwaan sah
I never get weary yeah, oh no!
Free up Jah Jah children
Mek dem run home a yard
Free up Jah Jah children
Mek dem run home a yard
A yard.. a yard..
Father sucked the sour grape
Set the children teeth on edge
Mother sucked the sour grape
She set the children free of tears
On edge.. on edge..
Nicodemus! Nicodemus!
Nicodemus went to Jah Jah by night
To ask Him the way of salvation and right
You gotta be born again, you gotta be born again!
Free up Jah Jah children
Mek dem run home a yard
Free up Jah Jah children
Mek dem run home a yard
A yard.. a yard..
Now it's a long long time we a gwaan sah
I never get weary yeah, oh no!
Now it's a long long time we a gwaan sah
I never get weary yeah, oh no!
Free up Jah Jah children
Mek dem run home a yard
Free up Jah Jah children
Mek dem run home a yard
A yard.. a yard..
Pope Pius! Pope Pius!
Pope Pius went to Jah Jah by night..Embed
