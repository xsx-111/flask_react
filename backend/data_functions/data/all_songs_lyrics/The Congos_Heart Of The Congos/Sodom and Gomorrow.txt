Sodom and Gomorrow LyricsSodom and Gomorrow was destroyed by fire
Sodom and Gomorrow was destroyed by fire
It keep on burning
It keep on burning
Seven golden candlesticks, yeah
In the King's palace, he smoke his chalice
So he keeps on burning
While the table keeps turning
They're at the turning point
They're at the turning point, to reality
They keep on burning
They keep on burning
Down in the mudhole
That's where I used to break my bread
Down in the dungeon
That's where I used to lay my head
No more lick from the licking stick
It keep on burning
No more trick
It keep on burning
Sodom and Gomorrow was destroyed by fire
Sodom and Gomorrow was destroyed by fire
It keep on burning
It keep on burning
Seven golden candlesticks yeah
In the King's palace, he smoke his chalice
While he keeps on burning
The table keeps turning
They're at the turning point
They're at the turning point, to reality
They keep on burning
They keep on burning
Down in the mudhole
That's where I used to break my bread
Down in the dungeon
That's where I used to lay my head
No more straw making bricks
No more lick from the licking stickEmbed
