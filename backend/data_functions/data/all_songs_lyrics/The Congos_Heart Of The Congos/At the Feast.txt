At the Feast LyricsThere was an a**embly upon the mountain my brotherman
Idren and Idrens chanting together yeah
It was the Feast of the Passover (x2)
Idren and Idrens were chanting together yeah
Hail Natty Dread have you any herbs my brotherman?
Yes my brother yes, ten crocus bags full
Live it up rightly my brothers, live it up rightly yeah
It was the Feast of the Passover...Embed
