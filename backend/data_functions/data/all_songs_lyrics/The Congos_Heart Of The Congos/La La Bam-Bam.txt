Joseph with his coat of many colours
Was cast in the pit by his own brothers
And Daniel in the lion's den
Fools thought they would not see him again
Daniel in the lion's den
They thought they would never see him again
Oh yeah what a la la bam bam bam
Oh yeah what a la la bam bam bam
Shedrack, Meshack and Abadnego
They came forward and away they go
Daniel in the lion's den
They thought they would never see them again
Oh yeah what a la la bam bam bam
Oh yeah what a la la bam bam bamEmbed
