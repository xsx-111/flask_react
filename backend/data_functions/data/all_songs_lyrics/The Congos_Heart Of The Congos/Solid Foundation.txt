Solid Foundation LyricsWe are living on Jah solid foundation
(I and I are solid as a rock)
We are living on Jah solid foundation
(I and I are solid as a rock)
So, don't matter what the people of today say
(I and I still a praise Jah)
I and I holding onto Jah
(I and I still a praise Jah)
In my Father's house, yeah (aah, aah)
There are many mansions
If it wasn't so
I wouldn't tell it to my brethrens
'Cause them no know Jah (no know)
No know Jah (no know)
Jah Dread the Conquering Lion of Judah
Them no know Jah (no know)
No know Jah (no know)
Jah Dread the Conquering Lion of Judah
In my Father's house, yeah (aah, aah)
There are many mansions
If it wasn't so
I wouldn't tell it to my brethrens
'Cause them no know Jah (no know)
No know Jah (no know)
Jah Dread the Conquering Lion of Judah
Them no know Jah (no know)
No know Jah (no know)
Jah Dread the Conquering Lion of Judah
Them no know Jah (no know)
No know Jah (no know)
Jah Dread the Conquering Lion of JudahEmbed
