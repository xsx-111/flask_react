Ark of the Covenant LyricsEvery morning the black sun rise
Every morning the black sun rise
It shines out of the Ark of the Covenant
It shines out of the Ark of the Covenant
Princes, priests and warriors
Princes, priests and warriors
They were all saved in the Ark of the Covenant
They were all saved in the Ark of the Covenant
A pair of everything was saved in the ark
A pair of everything was saved in the ark
Even the ants, saved in a Noah sugar-pan
Even the ants, saved in a Noah sugar-pan
Princes, priests and warriors
Princes, priests and warriors
They were all saved in the Ark of the Covenant
They were all saved in the Ark of the Covenant
The Ark the Ark
The Ark Live it up in the Covenant
The Ark Live it up in the Covenant
Every morning the black sun rise...Embed
