Bad Seeds (Live) LyricsThey keep us apart from the other kids
They try to keep us from each other
We're no good, that's what they say
But we just see this world in a different way
We're bad, bad seeds
Bad, bad, bad, bad seeds
We're bad, bad seeds
Bad, bad, bad, bad seeds
They make a lot of rules
They tell a lot of lies
If we don't wanna, we won't behave
And they can't make us, 'cause we can't be made
We're bad, bad seeds
Bad, bad, bad, bad seeds
We're bad, bad seeds
Bad, bad, bad, bad seeds
The new generation formed the teenage nation
This time, let's do it right
We're bad, bad seeds
Bad, bad, bad, bad seeds
We're bad, bad seeds
Bad, bad, bad seeds
Bad, bad seeds
We're bad, bad, bad seeds
We're bad, bad seeds
Bad, bad, bad, bad seeds
We're bad, bad seeds
