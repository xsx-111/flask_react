Foggy Eyes Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4

Keep your eyes shut and live your life
Someone else will pay the price
Open up your eyes and speak your mind
Leave your youth far behind

Foggy eyes lookin' at their friends
Wondering what's to become of them
Think about the way it used to be
Foggy eyes, why can't you see?
I tried to tell you that it was okay that
You were gonna go away
You're like the people that I never meet
Like the foggy eyes walking down the street

Foggy eyes, lookin' at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, goin' bang bang bang
Foggy eyes, lookin' at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, goin' bang bang bang

Foggy eyes at home in a box of pain
Look in the mirror and travel far away
The world they see is enough to make you cry
Foggy eyes, say goodbye to love
Foggy eyes, lookin' at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, goin' bang bang bang
Foggy eyes, lookin' at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, goin' bang bang bang

There's things we want each other to be
I'm sorry that you think you're not important to me
I don't know why we make each other cry
Don't know why we all got foggy eyes
I think about all the things I never do
How I'm such a disappointment to you
'Cause I wanna play with you
I wanna get away from you

Foggy eyes, lookin' at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, goin' bang bang bang
Foggy eyes, goin' bang bang bang bang1Embed
