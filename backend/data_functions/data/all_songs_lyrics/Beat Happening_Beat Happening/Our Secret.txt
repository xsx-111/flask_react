Our Secret LyricsI was walking in our town
I was walking through the store
I saw a pretty girl
She held open the door
I said I like you
She said that she liked me
And we could be friends
In our special secret way
I went to sit at the cafe
There she was again
So I said hey
We should go swimming in Capitol Lake
We had a lot of fun but then it got real late
So I walked her home
And had dinner with her family
That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why
I had dinner with her family
We went to her friend's house
To have a cup of tea
She said that it was true
She was in love with me
I knew right then we had to be alone
'Cause no one in this whole world could ever understand
That's why we're running away
That's why we're running away
That's why
I had dinner with her familyEmbed
