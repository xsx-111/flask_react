I Spy LyricsI'm more important in the USA than a spy for the FBI
I'm trained to meet the criminal elite and I seek out wherever evil resides
I spy
I'm at home in the streets of Rome or just hanging round old Shanghai
Danger is my logo, espionage a go-go, I'm just digging this american crime
Two deadly agents of a wicked persuasion tried to send me on a permanent vacation
I gave them the slip 'cause I'm totally hip to that modern counter espionage
I spy
I got a bulletproof car and a secret star and a ring with X-Ray eyes
I wear spanish boots, brooks brother suits and I don't know how to cryEmbed
