Fourteen LyricsWe were looking at your rabbits
We were feeding them some cabbage
You were telling me that you have a black and white cat
We took a walk, we start to hop, jump rope, play hopscotch
All the things i wanted to say
Staring at your face, then looking away
All the things i wanted to tell
But i couldn't trust you, i couldn't trust myself
It's not that you're bad no
I just can't seem to let myself go
You see to me
The best part of sex is walking home holding hands after swimming in the lake
To me
The best part of love is when you say you'll be my friend
We were wearing our pajamas we were eating some bananas
I want to tell you how i want to be your pal
All the things i wanted to say
Staring at your face, then looking away
Now it's too lateEmbed
