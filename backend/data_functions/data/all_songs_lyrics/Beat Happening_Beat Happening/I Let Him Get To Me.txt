I Let Him Get To Me LyricsMy friends ask me why i look so down
Why come they haven't seen me around town
Cause i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me, he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me, he don't let me get to him
I see him walking around so cool
And i am feeling like such a fool
Cause i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me he don't let me get to him
I think about why i feel this way
I think about it most every day
I try to change the way i feel about you
But when i try i see that i'm not being true
Cause i let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me but he don't let me get to him
I let him get to me he don't let me get to himEmbed
