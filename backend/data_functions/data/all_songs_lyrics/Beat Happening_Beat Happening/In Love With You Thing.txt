In Love With You Thing LyricsI know i'm too shy
I know you can't read my mind
This situation has got the makin'
For some very serious heartbreakin'
Cause you're going away
You're going away
You're going away
You're going away
Can't you see
I got this crazy, powerful in love with you thing
My memory is bleedin' from how i spent this year
Opportunities slipped through my fingers
Now i've never met you and i never will
Cause you're going away
Oh-oh you're going away
Oh-no you're going away
You're going away
Can't you see
I got this crazy, powerful in love with you thing
No matter who you're with
You show unhappiness
If i could touch those parted lips
Your swinging little hips just gotta be kissed
But you're going away
Oh-oh you're going away
Oh-no you're going away
You're going away from me
But i got this crazy powerful in love with you thingEmbed
