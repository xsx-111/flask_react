Down at the Sea LyricsMr. fish is having a party
Down at the sea
With really loud music and the food is free
Down, down at the sea
So let's put on some sun tan lotion
And drive your car out to the ocean, to the ocean, to the ocean
Where we can play all day
Down at the sea
And we won't care if there's anyone there
Down, down at the sea
I've got the beach ball and you've got the song
Everybody's gonna sing along, gonna sing along, gonna sing along
Put the radio under a palm tree
Down at the sea
It's a swinging place for you and me
Down, down at the sea
Dance, dance, swish, swish
I dance with the clams and you dance with the fish, you dance with the fish, you dance with the fish
When the sun comes down we'll go to sleep
Down at the sea
Mrs. lobster's gonna tuck us in
Down, down at the sea
And we'll dream about the waves out there
Coming in and washing us away, washing us away, washing us away1Embed
