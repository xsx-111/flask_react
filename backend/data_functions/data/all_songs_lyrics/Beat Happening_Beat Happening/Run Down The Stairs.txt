Run Down The Stairs LyricsI wanna tell the truth
I really do
I get so scared
When i try to talk to you
Cause you know me when i open up my mouth
And you see my eyes when i say what i say
When i say what i say
Yeah, when i say what i say
When i say what i say
But i don't know the truth
And i can't talk
I clap my hands
And go for a long walk
I cut my hair
I run down stairs
Run down stairs
I dance around in a small room
With the lights turned down
I think about you now
I walk around late at night
Cause i can't go to sleep cause you're not here
To turn out the light
Turn, turn, turn out the light
I guess it's all right
My hands hold the world
They hold my head
They hold my knees up to my chest
They tell the truth
They love you so
My hands would touch you but they don't know how
They don't know how
They don't know how
They don't know howEmbed
