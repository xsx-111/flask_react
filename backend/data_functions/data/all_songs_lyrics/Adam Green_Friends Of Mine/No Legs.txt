No Legs LyricsThere's no wrong way to fuck a girl with no legs
Just tell her you love her as she's crawlin' away
There's no wrong way to fuck a bitch with no faith
Now you'll never be sad again
Lovin' you are the two best things
In a world that's skipping town
Reaching blind into the deepest mouth
In the brownest place around
There's something amiss in her cum stained lips
So I get the first kiss before she takes the last bite
Genital outlaws in a positive way
And in everything bagel too
Getting strangled by the junkie priest
As the boys get stoned in school
There's a knock at your door and your parents come in
They thought you were a different girl
So if you're alone when your parents aren't home
And no one can see your incestuous tree
No need to contain what the sparrows can say
Now you'll never be sad againEmbed
