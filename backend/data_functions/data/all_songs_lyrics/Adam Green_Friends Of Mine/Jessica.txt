Jessica Lyrics
Jessica Simpson, where has your love gone?
It's not in your music, no
You need a vacation to wake up the cavemen
And take them to Mexico

Jessica, Jessica Simpson
You've got it all wrong
Your fraudulent smile
The way that you faked it the day that you died

My body's in shambles
Incrusted with brambles
That sharpen the air I breathe
What's on the menu?
Jessica, can you
Take down my order, please?

Jessica, Jessica Simpson
You've got it all wrong
Your fraudulent smile
The way that you faked it the day that you died
Tomorrow gets closer
A purple bulldozer
Is calling you on the phone
Your love life precedes you
Your son-in-law feeds you
Injections of cortisone

Jessica, Jessica Simpson
You've got it all wrong
Your fraudulent smile
The way that you faked it the day that you died

Jessica Simpson, where has your love gone?
Its not in your music
So where has it gone then, Jessica?Embed
