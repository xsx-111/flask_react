Secret Tongues LyricsThere are men in shades, just standing around
These bleeding stars, the paradox
Let the eyes of God be our guide to find a gentle path
There's a broken record playing a tune
To the floating waves of the antennas
And you were just a little guy, and I was little too
And everything is just floating freely
Just rocking around like a rocking horse
Just jiggling around like silly putty
And who are you and I?
And you were looking at me smiling
The aliens were just arriving
Wherever they are headed next
Speaking secret tonguesEmbed
