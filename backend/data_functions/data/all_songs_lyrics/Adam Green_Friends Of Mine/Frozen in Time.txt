Frozen in Time LyricsFrozen in time, forever
Carrying that torch for so long
Can you hear my heart? Believe in
Frozen in the index of time
They singled out my tongue
In front of everyone who was watching my show
They say that I'm no good
I'm sorry that I could be that way to you
Dusting off the Roman dollar
Searching for some work on the side
I'm just closer to death than ever
Frozen in the index of time
They just don't have the minds
To pay me for my crimes that they made me do
They don't care how it feels
To them this isn't real in my magical womb
Frozen in time, forever
Carrying that torch for so long
Can you hear my heart? Believe in
Frozen in the index of time, babyEmbed
