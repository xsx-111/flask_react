Hard To Be a Girl Lyrics
Hard to be a girl, so nice to be a boy
In my room at night, not a pretty site

Here's an empty kiss marching
To the rhythm of the pay roll
I can be a good boy too
Just let me out of the stable

Sausages and eggs
And hot and sour soup
Thank me for your time
'Cause I can be as bad as you

Hard to be a girl
That's what the oracle told me
I don't care what she says
I assume it's best to be lonelyEmbed
