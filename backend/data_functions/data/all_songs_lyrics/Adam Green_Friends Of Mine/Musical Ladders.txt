Musical Ladders Lyrics
Musical ladders
Leaning on mountains
Bathed in white laughter
Under the sun

Somebody's birthday
Came stumbling towards us
Wrapped in green gladness
Under the sun

We're gonna make it
Through this war tonight
Someone hold this child
Up to the light

Prostitute fingers
Fumbling with matches
Tucked in red couches
Under green moons

Mexican waitress
Got caught in the crossfire
Of militant families
Bursting with Jews

We're gonna break it
To your folks tonight
Kind of hope your pops
Don't hear me right, oh yeahEmbed
