Bunnyranch Lyrics
Bind me, gag me take me to the bunnyranch

People dying kill me in the packing house
Even you have to win sometimes dear
Poison needle smoker, break a broken window, mind you

One kiss, two kiss, I can make it look like that
Do me Dolly, rape me in the parking lot
Even you have to win sometimes dear
Poison needle smoker, break a broken window, mind you
