Friends of Mine Lyrics
And we live on borrowed time
But this headshot's pretty good
I've been scheming for too long
I was starstruck by your mom

We fall in love by accident
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to some friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine

And we brake for passing cars
In the pistol ripping chase
I regret the drugs you lost
So I skipped our second date

We fall in love by accident
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to some friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
Oh, friends of mine
We fall in love by accident
A heavenly coincidence
No matter what you think is true
Let me introduce you to
Can't figure out this place
Guess someone hates my guts
I handed him the sign
Oh, friends of mineEmbed
