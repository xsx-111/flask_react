Bungee LyricsShe used to live with an indian chief
Who gave her the clap that he got from a priest
Night after night, i would lie with her pets
Like a mailorder bride in a box by the steps
She went bungee jumping
One fine day
Off the cliffs of our friendship
And at the bottom she stayed
When they told me that her body was found
An astronaut drowned in the long island sound
I tripped down the stairs in my basketball shoes
And paddled down stream in my father's canoe
In the kingdom of bungee
The castle's been stained
But the kingdom of incest
Still has a mighty fine nameEmbed
