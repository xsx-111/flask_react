Broken Joystick LyricsSkeleton of a smoking plane
Catch a train to an open vein
The smoke just cleared
Something went wrong
The catfish choked
The sky is gone
Beneath their boats
The forecast floats
The joystick choked
The joystick smokes
Mariachi clothes look good on everyone
Klu Klux Klans will dance around the mountain
Plugging up the holes in their harmonicas
Push away from the overdose
Just in time for the fairy bowsEmbed
