Salty Candy LyricsIn the front of the line
Now I'm back at home
I wanna live my life
In a bathtub
Roll a dirty dice
And you're playin' blood
Stole a maxi pad
Because I abandoned love
It reminds me of salty candy
Semen shanties
Sailboats grindin'
Up against your back
I don't need no sentimental
Penis stencil
Feelings rising
Opposites attract
She made me feel so small
I had no say at all
She looked so cute they say
But I don't know her that way
Heaven hold me back
I got 20 lives
I got my Jesus jammies
Need some exercise
Take a walk at night
Past the dating bar
I wanna live my life
Like a track star
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, naEmbed
