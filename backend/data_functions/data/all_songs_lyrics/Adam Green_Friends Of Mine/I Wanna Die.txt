I Wanna Die LyricsI wanna choose to die
And be buried with a Rubik's cube
And sleep inside the big blue buildings
While the sweet disease drives through
There's a bakery in the night sky
I wanna die because the government lied
She was a man with herpes
Floating in a yellow stream
Running through the windows backwards
Kissing all the buildings clean
Note his appetite for hardcore tapes
And orgiastic party games
She woke up in the highway
With arrows pointing at her face
Later that day in gym class
She ate a mouth full of anthrax
Go to sleepEmbed
