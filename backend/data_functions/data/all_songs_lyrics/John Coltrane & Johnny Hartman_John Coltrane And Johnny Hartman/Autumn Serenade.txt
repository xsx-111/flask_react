Autumn Serenade LyricsThru the trees comes autumn with her serenade
Melodies the sweetest music ever played
Autumn kisses we knew are beautiful souvenirs
As I pause to recall the leaves seem to fall like tears
Silver stars were clining to an autumn sky
Love was ours until October wandered by
Let the years come and go
I'll still feel the glow that time can not fade
When I hear that lovely autumn serenadeEmbed
