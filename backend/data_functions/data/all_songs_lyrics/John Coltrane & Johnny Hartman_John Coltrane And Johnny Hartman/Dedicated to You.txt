Dedicated to You LyricsIf I should write a book for you
That brought me fame and fortune too
That book would be like my heart and me
Dedicated to you
And if I should paint a picture too
That showed the loveliness of you
My art would be like my heart and me
Dedicated to you
To you
Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way
To you
Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day
If I should find a twinkling star
One half as wondrous as you are
That star would be like my heart and me
Dedicated to you
To you
Because your love is the beacon that lights up my way
To you
Because with you I know a lifetime could be just one heavenly day
If I should find a twinkling star
One half as wondrous as you are
That star would be like my heart and me
