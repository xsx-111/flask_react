No Time LyricsShe can be rich or she can be poor
She can be entertaining or be a bore
She can drive a Mini Cooper or a Cadillac
But I gotta tell you baby, there's no turning back, 'cause
I've got no time
I've got no time
I've got no time
For messing around
So come on now
You consider, and you make your stand
You can take your little lover by your hand
You can run around, jump up and down
But you don't get me, I won't be your clown, 'cause
I've got no time
I've got no time
I've got no time
For messing around
Messing around with you
Hey, baby, there's a brand new sound, called
People living underground, and it's a
Story 'bout a-raising hell, I said
It's my life, babe, I know so well
But you, there ain't a thing you can do
So come on now
You can laugh, and sugar, you can cry
You can live your life, baby, and then you die
You can walk around with your hand in the air
But you talk like that, you don't get nowhere, 'cause
I've got no time
I've got no time
I've got no time
For messing around
Messing around with you
Hey, baby, there's a brand new sound, called
People living underground, and it's a
Story 'bout a-raising hell, I said
It's my life, babe, I know so well
But you, there ain't a thing you can do
So come on now
You consider, and you make your stand
You can take your little lover by your hand
You can run around, jump up and down
But you don't get me, I won't be your clown, 'cause
I've got no time
I've got no time
I've got no time
For messing around
Messing around with youEmbed
