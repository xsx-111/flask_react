Erotic Neurotic LyricsI wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
Won't you let me be your lover baby
I'll do the best I can
Wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
Won't you let me be your lover baby
I'll do the best I can
Won't you help me be your lover, darlin'?
I'll help you understand
Won't you let me be your lover, baby?
Come on, get it while you can
Come on!
Wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
Won't you let me be your lover baby
I'll do the best I can
I wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
Won't you let me be your lover baby
I'll do the best I can
Won't you help me be your lover, darlin'?
I'll help you understand
Won't you let me be your lover, baby?
Come on, get it while you can
Come on!
Wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
Won't you let me be your lover baby
I'll do the best I can
I wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
Won't you let me be your lover baby
I'll do the best I can
Won't you help me be your lover, darlin'?
I'll help you understand
Won't you let me be your lover, baby?
Come on, get it while you can
