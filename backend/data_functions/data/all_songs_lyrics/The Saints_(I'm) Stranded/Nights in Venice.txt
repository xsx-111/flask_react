Nights in Venice LyricsIt's so black as I crash into the backroom
I feel so sick honey listen to the girls moan
My eyes they water and my knees is a-weak
And I fall down every time that you speaks
Shine on shine my little star
Up above the world honey that you are
Shine on now you don't give me no love
Hit me like a death ray baby from above
Come on!
Speeding down the highway you got no time to waste
Brain all used up just like the human race
Head spinning around from the 39th highball
And your sultan owns a queen who ain't nothing but a
Screwball
Shine on shine my little star
Up above the world honey that you are
Shine on now you don't give me no love
Hit me like a death ray baby from above
24 hours till the end of the show, boy
If you are looking for love that don't give you much
Time, boy
If your baby's by your side you are gonna see her cry
Boy
And when you look into her eyes it just won't bring you
No joy
Oh no!
Shine on shine my little star
Up above the world honey that you are
Shine on now you don't give me no love
Hit me like a death ray baby from above
Wow!
Come on!
I said take it
Take it down
Listen
I said it keep comin' down, need to calm down need you
To calm down. Sink it. A bit out of time. Shake it
Take it. Come on, won't you take me for a ride. Won't
You shake me, out of time? Won't you take me, for a
Ride? Take me down. Shake me. Little baby shake it
Little baby shake it. Take me down. Are you there? Take
Me down, down the ground. Yeah down. Yeah, drunk. Down
Down down down, yeah! Ah come on sugar! Gonna
Take a ride, where the girls don't come. I wanna take
Your hand, go across the sand. When the girls don't
Come. Come one sure, I gotta take a run where the girls
Don't come. Well I take your hand, get across the sand
Where the girls don't come, yeah walk to run. Gotta
Have some, yeah I gotta be a son, ah come on! I
Said people come on, I can't come no more
East side west side it all looks the same now
Don't need nobody but you don't care nohow
Don't need no love, don't need no hate
You were screaming so loud but it was much too late
Oh no!
Shine on shine my little star
Up above the world honey that you are
Shine on now you don't give me no love
Hit me like a death ray baby from above
Wow!
Come on baby
Make it bad
Come on woman
Get it backEmbed
