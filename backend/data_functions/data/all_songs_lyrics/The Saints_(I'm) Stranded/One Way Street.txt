One Way Street LyricsOn the left on the right honey, it's all the same
People everywhere are still playing the same old game, yeah
For a dime they put you down lay you in your grave, yes they will
They put you down when you are not around it drives you insane
That's why I gotta get some changes made
Honey, want to rearrange some day
C'mon little baby, my mind is getting sick of today
I said come on right now
Uptown downtown acting just like you should
Even if you play their game it won't do you no good
There's too many creeps out there hungry for your blood, yes they are
They put you down when you are not around, drives you insane
That's why I gotta get some changes made
Honey want to rearrange some day
C'mon little baby, my mind is sick enough of today
All right now!
You can say anything!
Come on, take it away!
Don't know why sometimes I don't feel like trying
Seeing everybody darlin' only makes me mad
If they don't like it honey guess that's too bad
It's just driving me mad
Goin' outta my brain!
It's drivin' me insane!
Can't stand this pain!
Ah, come on now!
Uptown downtown acting just like you should
Even if you play their game, it won't do you no good
There's too many creeps out there hungry for your blood, yes they are
They put you down when you are not around, drives you insane
That's why I gotta get some changes made
Honey want to rearrange some day
C'mon little baby, my mind is sick enough of todayEmbed
