Wild About You LyricsYou make me feel just like a savage
Honey, running through the jungle after you
I'm like a wild man on a rampage
Yeah, I found the safari, babe, but where are you?
I feel like a horrible creature
But, honey, I don't want to scare you
Yeah, you look so good I could eat you
But I won't kiss a steak so I won't eat you
I'm wild about the way-out clothes you wear
Your pretty dresses, your teased-up hair
You laugh at me since I'm staring at you
Honey, laugh at me, but you're lovin' it too
'Cause you're wild and I'm wild about you
You're wild and I'm wild about you
Come on!
Oh baby, you're so wild
I'm gonna make you mine
I'm gonna comin' to getcha
Right now
You make me feel just like a savage
Baby, running through the jungle after you
I'm like a wild man on a rampage
Yeah, I found the safari, babe, but where are you?
I feel like a horrible creature
But honey, I don't want to scare you
Yeah, you look so good that I could eat you
But I won't kiss a steak so I won't eat you
I'm wild about the way-out clothes you wear
Your pretty dresses, your teased-up hair
You laugh at me since I'm staring at you
Honey, laugh at me, but you're lovin' it too
'Cause you're wild and I'm wild about you
You're wild and I'm wild about you
Come on!
Yes you're wild - but what can I do?
Yes you're wild - I can't stand it!
Yes you're wild - I'm goin' insane!
Yes you're wild!Embed
