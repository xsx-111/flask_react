Story of Love LyricsWhat's that you say, girl?
You did it all for me
But you didn't want to
Lose your nobility, come on
It sounds so wrong when you say it
It sounds so wrong when you see I'm not playing your fool
But that's the story of love
What's that you say, girl?
You did it all for me
But you didn't want to
Lose your nobility, come on
It sounds so wrong when you say it
It sounds so wrong when you see I'm not playing your fool
But that's the story of love
Come on!
What's that you say, girl?
You did it all for me
But you didn't want to
Lose your nobility, come on
It sounds so wrong when you say it
It sounds so wrong when you see I'm not playing your fool
But that's the story of love
Yeah, that's the glory of loveEmbed
