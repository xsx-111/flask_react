Skull Lyrics
There is history in this place
There are dragons to be chased
And though I don't know who you are
An easy flow and a strong, a strong heart

And the charm in the way you hide
Gently take my skull for a ride

And I don't know who you are
But I know what I would like you to be
A one-night stand under stoned persuasion

But a joy that I can't hide
Gently take my skull for a ride

We can never ever go too far
The pain we can't escape at least will wait
So let's go quickly, no, we go slow
Let's go chasing dragons through the snow

Kindly take my all
And give me all you have
Gently take my skull for a ride
Take and shake your soul
But never lose control
Gently take your skull for a rideEmbed
