Give Up Lyrics
Burn out, man, typically bitter
Find me locked into the vicious cycle
Find me trapped and scared simple

Money, money, money
Money, more money
The helpless slob in his dead end day job
Helpless slob in his dead end day job

I'm reaching every goal
Maybe a girlfriend under control
An easy target and drag down anchor
The co-dependent self-styled nightmare
And it's a shame 'cause I really don't care
I drop it off but I leave it hanging thereEmbed
