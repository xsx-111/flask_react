S**t Soup LyricsI like saying yes and watching you take
I don't need to sleep or eat
I smoke a thousand cigarettes
These days are so nurturing
When you're gone I'll eat and sleep away my days again
Crazy people are right on, crazy people are right
Crazy people are right on
You're shit soup
And I'm in the reflection booth
Two glass eyes behind
Cheap sunglasses move
Stained-glass gazebo
I really don't know
Our futures are so separate
Bespectacled and desperate
It's not my job to undo
The dying prophecy of you
It's not my job to undo
I like saying yes and watching you take
I don't need to sleep or eat
I'll smoke a thousand cigarettes
These days are so nurturing
When you're gone I'll eat and sleep away my days again
Crazy people are right on, crazy people are right
Crazy people are right on
They're so off, they're on
They're so off, they're on
They're so off, they're on
They're so off, they're on
They're so off, they're on
They're so off, they're on
They're so off, they're on
They're so offEmbed
