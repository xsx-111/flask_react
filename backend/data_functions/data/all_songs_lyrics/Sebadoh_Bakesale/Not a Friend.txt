Not a Friend LyricsI'm not a good friend, I'm not a friend at all
It's never resolved, I'm nervous when you call
My words are limp and my mind is dry
I try to be polite but I feel like I'm stuck for life
I follow my heart, it leads me far from you
No matter how close we are, I'm far, far away
I have too much now to fill my day-to-day
I'm not a good friend, I'm not a friend at all
I don't need obligations to our crippled conversations
I'd never tell you, it's something you should know
I'm not a friend at all oh, please let me go
Somehow I don't trust you, I don't trust myself
And I may never forgive you, 'cause I can't forgive myself
Somehow I don't trust you, I don't trust myself
And I may never forgive you, 'cause I can't forgive myself
Don't break my stride
Don't break my stride
Don't break my stride
Don't break my strideEmbed
