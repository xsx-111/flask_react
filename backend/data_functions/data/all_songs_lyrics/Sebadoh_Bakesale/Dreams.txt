Dreams LyricsIn my dreams I react as my true self
And I learn humility, twisted moral planes
As real as circumstance
Each night I dance with primal urges
Pornographic scenes
That always start as they are ending
In my dreams I walk with my true friends
We discover secrets; we run through our lives
Everything is twisted like abyss
To the past and distant future
I'm prepared for some big show
Tried to arrive but I moved too slow
Something's wrong when someone died
When I opened up my eyes
Something's wrong when someone died
When I opened up my eyesEmbed
