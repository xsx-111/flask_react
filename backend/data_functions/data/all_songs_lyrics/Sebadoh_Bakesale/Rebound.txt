Rebound LyricsHeart-broken and attractive
A sad, sloppy mess
Looking for approval
And easily impressed
Beware they say, but why would I listen?
I need to know what I've been missin'
I'm no one you can trust
All little boy lonely with curious lust
Confusion turns me upside down
Lost as quickly as I'm found
But soon enough it turns around
On the rebound
Call it fate or true love
Never forced romance
Fall into a new love
Maybe perfect love by chance
Beware they say, but why would I listen
When it feels this good?
No one lives their life
Doing all the things they say they should
Confusion turns me upside down
Lost as quickly as I'm found
But soon enough it turns around
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the rebound
On the reboundEmbed
