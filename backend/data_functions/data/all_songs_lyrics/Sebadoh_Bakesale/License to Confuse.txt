License to Confuse LyricsI'm not attractive today, I'm not a sight for sore eyes
I'm not an Adam or Eve, I'm just a nervous young thing
Hear my voice strain as I sing, my will will bend and then break
The cradle'll break and I'll fall, I couldn't help it at all
I've got a license to confuse
What do you got to lose?
A license to confuse
I guess I got what it takes to help me make this mistake
It took a while but I learned, it took a twist but it turned
And now it’s clear that I'm blind, another mountain to climb
Another distance to fall, I couldn't help it all
I've got a license to confuse
What do you got to lose?
A license to confuse
I shouldn't sound so forlorn, regret the day I was born
‘Cause here I am and I've been, I only need a few friends
My hands are sweating all day, like I've been letting me down
Like I've been letting me slide, just some nonsense on my mind
And a license to confuse
Nothing I can use
Bust it, build it, but I need it
Here's my license, that's my rightEmbed
