Together or Alone LyricsIt was never my intention
To blindly feed the boy-girl game
I know romance isn't everything
But I'm obsessing just the same
Because today I don't feel worthy
You seem so beautiful and strong
These unsure hands could never soothe you
Too afraid of doing something wrong
And this confusion wears me down
Until I feel like a nervous stranger
And could I help you grow?
I guess we'll never know
Set up for the let-down
But these things happen all the time
And I'm not longing to explore it again
I'm too scared of what you'll find
And this confusion wears me down
But I'll smile when I'm with you
'Cause there's so much we could do
Together or alone
I'm not afraid of being aloneEmbed
