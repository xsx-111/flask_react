Drama Mine LyricsClose the venetian blind
Send up the kite and say goodbye to you
Soon I can see right through
You're sitting here talking to
Real eyes, pools of blue
Making what you say the rule
You make me dream of broken tools
I need the Dramamine
To be as crazy as your scene
I know it's not a dream
Don't know what you're telling me?
It's like wasting everything
On someone else's dream
It's like wasting everything
On someone else's dream
Seems pretty crazy to me
Seems pretty crazy to me
Seems pretty crazy to meEmbed
