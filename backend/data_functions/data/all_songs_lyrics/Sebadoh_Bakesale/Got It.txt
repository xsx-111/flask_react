Got It Lyrics
I don't quite get it
But I know you've got it
I don't care if nothing else goes my way all day
I'm taking your morning warmth with me and into the day
And I don't care if nothing else goes my way all day

I think I can stay here awhile with you
You make me feel much better
Scared indeed to be without
Storm renders compass useless
I'm wanting to be real
I feel the end of something
Everything before us is hopeless
Everything beforeâ€”

I don't quite get it
But I know you've got it
I don't care if nothing else goes my way all day
I'm taking your morning warmth with me and into the day
I don't care if nothing else goes my way all dayEmbed
