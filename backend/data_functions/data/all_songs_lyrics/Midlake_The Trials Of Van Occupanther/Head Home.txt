Head Home LyricsNo one seems to be around today
They must've all gone off without me again
I think I'll head home
Maybe I'll find them gathered 'round my doorstep
Oh, to sleep in a comfortable bed
I think I'll head home
No one seems to be around today
They must've all gone off without me again
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
Bring me a day full of honest work
And a roof that never leaks
I'll be satisfied
Bring me the news all about the town
How it struggles to help all the farmers out
During harvest time
But there's someone I'd like to see
She never mentions a word to me
She reads Leviathan
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
Bring me a day full of honest work
And a roof that never leaks
I'll be satisfied
Bring me the news all about the town
How it struggles to help all the farmers out
During harvest time
But there's someone I'd like to see
She never mentions a word to me
She reads Leviathan
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home
I think I'll head home1Embed
