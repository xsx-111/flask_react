Branches LyricsI saw she was living under some branches
I saw she was happy in her circumstances
I also live under branches
I'd rather not live in these places
In these places
We won't get married
'Cause she won't have me
She wakes up awfully early these days, these days
And there's no-one else so kind
There's no-one else to find
It's hard for me but I'm trying
It's hard for me but I'm trying
I saw she was busy gathering wood for a fire
I'd like to help her some but she replies "it's done"
We won't get married
'Cause she won't have me
She wakes up awfully early these days, these days
And there's no-one else so kind
There's no-one else to find
It's hard for me but I'm trying
It's hard for me but I'm trying
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)
It's hard for me but I'm trying (It's hard for me but I'm trying)1Embed
