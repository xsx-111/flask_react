Roscoe LyricsStonecutters made them from stones
Chosen specially for you and I
Who will live inside
The mountaineers gathered timber
Piled high
In which to take along
Traveling many miles, knowing they'd get here
When they got here, all exhausted
On the roof leaks they got started
And now when the rain comes
We can be thankful
Ooh aah ooh
When the mountaineers
Saw that everything fit, they were
Glad and so they took off
Thought we were due for
A change or two
Around this place
When they get back they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
The village used to be all one really needs
Now it's filled with hundreds and hundreds of
Chemicals that mostly surround you
You wish to flee but it's not like you
So listen to me, listen to me
Oh, oh, oh and when the morning comes
We will step outside
We will not find another man in sight
We like the newness, the newness of all
That has grown in our garden, struggling for so long
Whenever I was a child I wondered what if my name had changed into something more productive like Roscoe
Been born in 1891
Waiting with my Aunt Rosaline
Thought we were due for
A change or two
Around this place
When they get back they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
1891
They roamed around and foraged
They made their house from cedars
They made their house from stone
Oh, they're a little like you, and
They're a little like me
We have all we need
Thought we were due for
A change or two
Around this place
(This place)
(This place)
When they get back they're all mixed up with no one to stay with
(When they get back they're all mixed up with no one to stay with)7Embed
