Van Occupanther LyricsI must be careful now in my steps
Years of calculations and the stress
My science is waiting, nearly complete
One glass will last for nearly a week
Let me not get down from walking with no-one
And if I stumble from exhaustion
These buckets are heavy, I fill them with water
I could ask these people, but I shouldn't bother
Oh no, I've stumbled, was I going too fast?
Some get angry, some of them laugh
They told me I wouldn't, but I found an answer
I'm Van Occupanther, I'm Van Occupanther!
Let me not be too consumed with this world
Sometimes I want to go home
And stay out of sight for a long time
Let me not be too consumed with this world
Sometimes I want to go home
And stay out of sight for a long time1Embed
