Young Bride LyricsMy young bride
Why are your shoulders like that
Of a tired old woman
Like a tired old woman?
My young bride
Why are your fingers like that
Of the hedge in winter
Of the hedge in winter?
Polonaise in winter
Snowshoes and hunters
Carried the goods in for you
My young bride
Why aren't you moving at all
Helps to make the day seem shorter
Helps to make the day seem shorter
My young bride
Why aren't you keeping with you
All the ones who really love you
All the ones who really love you?
Polonaise in winter
Snowshoes and hunters
Carried the goods in for you
Darkness and forest
Grant you the longest
Face made for porridge and stew1Embed
