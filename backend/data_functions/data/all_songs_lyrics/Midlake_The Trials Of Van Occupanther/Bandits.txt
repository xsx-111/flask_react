Bandits LyricsDid you ever want to be overrun by bandits;
To hand over all of your things and start over new?
While we were out hunting for food
Our house was being robbed
I caught an apple and she caught a fox
So I caught a rabbit but she caught an ox
So upon our return, we found everything gone
Which for us was no loss
We started over
With a rabbit and an ox
So they came down from the north
Carrying all they owned
With a basket full of food and clothes
They were stopped by a weekend raid
Traveling the woods one day
They tried to put up a fight, but lost
So we asked for them to stay
With us on their way
To have a drink and rest
And regain their strength
Did you ever want to run around with bandits;
To see many places and hide in ditches?
It's not always easy, it's not always easy
When the winter comes and the greenery goes
We will make some shelter
When the winter comes and the greenery goes
We will make some shelter1Embed
