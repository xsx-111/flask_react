We Gathered in Spring LyricsI'm tired of being here
On this hill
No-one lives to be three hundred years
Like the way it used to be
I think they were giants
I think they were giants
On this hill nothing grows except greed
You will stay to finish your work
As long as need be
As long as need be
On a clear day
I can see my old house
And my wife in the front yard
Talking with the friends
We gathered in spring
We gathered in spring
We gathered in spring
We gathered in spring
I'm tired of being here
On this hill
Where I'm sure to find my last meal
No-one lives to be three hundred years
On a clear day
I can see my old house
And my wife in the front yard
Talking with the friends
We gathered in spring
We gathered in spring
We gathered in spring
We gathered in spring1Embed
