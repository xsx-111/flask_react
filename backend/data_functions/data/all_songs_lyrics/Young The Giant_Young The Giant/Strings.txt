Strings Lyrics
Oh, what did I say? She's all shook up
Lost in the summer, man; we're burning up
The time don't show when the sun gets carried
The tide curves off your body; oh, you'll stay with me

I-I-I-I-I-I, now I will show you
It's how I lie-ie-ie-ie-ie what no one told you

Oh, what did I say? She's all shook up
Vision by the seaside, we move in our hearts
But I don't know when the fire gets hazy
The flames roll down and off her body; oh, you'll stay with me

I-I-I-I-I, now I will show you
It's how I lie-ie-ie-ie-ie what no one told you
So ride, Sherry, ride, Sherry, ride; I will show you
We'll go in the night, wondering why no one told you

Now I can walk the stones of the shoreline
And taste the ocean salt when the cold shines
My words are rolling soft down your south side; oh, you wanna?
I-I-I-I-I, now I will show you
It's how I lie-ie-ie-ie-ie what no one told you
So ride, Sherry, ride, Sherry, ride; I will show you
We'll go in the night, wondering why no one told you

Why, you know it goes, you know it goes
Why, you know it goes, you know it goes
Why it goes...2Embed
