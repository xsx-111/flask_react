Your Side Lyrics
Always on time
You're in white light— but you're wrong, dear
You won't be telling all the lies when I'm gone
And you know it's for show
Everybody holds onto something
And you can't hide me...

Tell me I'm in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me I'm involved
And we will be fine
I, I, I'm still here
You-ou, ou-ou, ou're in the right
Everybody knows you tried
And I tried...

Always on time
You're on my mind— but you're wrong, dear
I won't be telling all the lies when you're gone
The front door opens slow
Everybody moves on someday
And I can't find you

Tell me you're in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me you're involved
And we will be fine
I, I, I'm still here
You-ou, ou-ou, ou're in the right
Everybody knows I tried
You tried...

Your eyes open up
Inside, you're fine

Tell me you're in charge
Back like the old days
Tell me you're involved
And we will be fine
I, I, I'm still here
You-ou, ou-ou, ou're in the right
Everybody knows I tried
And you tried...Embed
