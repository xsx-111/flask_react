Typhoon Lyrics
Over and over and over again
The tide carries
I give up my water and watch you sink in
Oh, the levy

At night when the coastline
Breaks
You hide in the fallen
Waves

On the rise and the sights of typhoon (Red and blue)
Washing by
And the rise falling in too (We fall through)
Holding tight
And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again...

Over and over and over again
(Oh the sun, oh the sun)
I give her my water and watch you sink in
(Oh mama, oh mama)
At night when the coastline
Breaks
You hide in the fallen
Waves

On the rise and the sights of typhoon (Red and blue)
Washing by
And the rise falling in too (We fall through)
Holding tight
And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again...

Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
On the rise and the sights of typhoon...

On the rise and the sights of typhoon (Red and blue)
Washing by
And the rise falling in too (We fall through)
Holding tight
And the dull effects of your suitcase
Are casting again...Embed
