St. Walker Lyrics
Oh, street walker in
Cloves, tell me where you
Go, tell me where you
Go...
Tell me where you go
Go...

Tell me where you
Walk, without moving at all

Oh, what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I'll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me, but here in sin
'Cause I want water where it's
Found, but you know
There, there...

Oh, tell me where you
Go in the night
Shadows are walking on the walls...
Street walker, where I go
Is all of my fault
Just tell me where you are...

Tell me where you
Love without leaving at all, and I'd go!

Oh, what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I'll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me, but here in sin
'Cause I want water where it's
Found, but you know
If there is water that you'll drown
You'll drown down in it

Drown in it
Drown in it, it
Drown in it
Drown in it, it

Oh, what a pretty high note
Where you run to, I'll go glistening
I should never know that
You were far from me, but here in sin
'Cause I want water where it's
Found, but you know
If there is water that you'll drown
You'll drown down in it4Embed
