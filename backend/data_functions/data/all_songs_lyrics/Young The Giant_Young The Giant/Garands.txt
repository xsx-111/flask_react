Garands Lyrics
Go, bright light, scout the forest
Through the night, searching for a
Sign of life; memories of
Fears and strife keep his legs from
Turning blue; broken bones and
Muddy shoes, running through the
Fields I knew, join the ranks of the
Favored few; what have I...

...Become?
Before the day is
Done
Now that we have...

Got what's left, lost my rights when
I was young, taken by the
Ones I trust, long before
I knew of love, all the things
I understood, fighting for
The greater good, now tell me why
This feels so wrong, feels so wrong
To hold this gun; now look what I've
Become
Before the day is
Done
Now that we have won...

The cold wind, you notice
The sky
It blows in to show us
The sign
It falls down before us
It lies
The cold wind, you notice
My eyes

Yeah!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!2Embed
