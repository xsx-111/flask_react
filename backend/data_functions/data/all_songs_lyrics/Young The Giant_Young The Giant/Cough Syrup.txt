Cough Syrup Lyrics
Life's too short to even care at all, whoa oh-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control
These fishes in the sea, they're staring at me
Whoa oh-oh, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A wet world aches for a beat of a drum, oh-whoa oh, oh

If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down, come down

Life's too short to even care at all, oh-whoa, oh
I'm coming up now, coming up now
Out of the blue, oh-oh, oh-oh
These zombies in the park, they're looking for my heart
Oh-whoa, oh, whoa-oh, oh
A dark world aches for a splash of the sun
Oh-whoa oh, oh, oh

If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
And so I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down
Life's too short to even care at all, oh, whoa-oh
I'm losing my mind, losing my mind, losing control


If I could find a way to see this straight
I'd run away, to some fortune that
I should have found
By now
So I run now to the things they said could restore me
Restore life the way it should be
I'm waiting for this cough syrup
To come down

One more spoon of cough syrup now, oh, whoa-oh
One more spoon of cough syrup now, whoa, oh, whoa52Embed
