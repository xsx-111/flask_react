Islands Lyrics
Five days
Underwater
Near your island
Off the coast, I know
Five ways
You were my lover
Incantation
Of the tide in rhyme

Oh
All in the glow of fire, you're waiting
Oh
Has it been so long now? Ah-ah ah
Oh
I thought you knew that I'd be coming
The way you move, a foreign groove
At night, I could never
I could never hold you...

Watch it rise up where you hide
Your pearls
Feel it pile up where you cast
Those stones you wear
When no one's home
Do they feel cold on your bones
All the years I miss your warmth
Have you missed my warmth?
On your island, oh...

Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh ooh ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh...6Embed
