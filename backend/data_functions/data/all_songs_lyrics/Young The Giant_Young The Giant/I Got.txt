I Got Lyrics
In the night, where I live, there's
Strange force in your kiss, oh
All's divine in desire
With an ire of philosophy
Burning scrolls in the naked heat
Oh, how coy
Is your little boy—no!

'Cause I know
It don't read that well, yeah

I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No, it won't be long
Before I rise in—
I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No it won't be long, yeah...

In the night, where I live
Your children sway; they fuel the kitsch
Raise their glass to Soviet crimes
In the war and in shadows
I write in tongues of old
Fumes are falling, smelling burned
Like always
Yes, always. Now, hear!

'Cause I know
It don't read that well
And I know
Only time will tell me

I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No, it won't be long
Before I rise in—
I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No, it won't be long
Before I rise in song!


And I know
It don't read that well, yeah!
I got (I got)
Buried (buried)
No, it won't be long
Before I rise in—
I got (I got)
Woah, buried (buried)
But no!
'Cause I know I got you!5Embed
