Every Little Thing Lyrics
Oh, I'm always
Home, I'm always home...

In time, I could see you break
Burn and see your robbers don't shake
Walking on your tree vines
Tell him that you know your crimes

Oh, I'm always
Home, I'm always...

When the sun has gathered 'round and all is safe
Cross the falls to the southern river where the robbers drank

Oh, oh, oh, I know that I was wrong
Oh, oh, oh, and that means every little thing
Oh, oh, oh, I want a fuck and a fight
Oh, oh, oh-oh...

In time, I could see you shake...
When the sun has settled down and I'm awake
Blessed souls in the southern river where the robbers sank, oh

Oh, I'm always
Home, I'm always
Home, I'm always
Home, I'm always...

Oh, oh, oh, I know that I was wrong
Oh, oh, oh, and that means every little thing
Oh, oh, oh, I want a fuck and a fight
Oh, oh, oh-oh...

Every little thing to, woah-oh oh
Every little thing to, woah-oh oh
Every little thing to, woah-oh oh
Every little thing to, woah-oh oh
Every little thing to, woah-oh oh
Every little thing to, woah-oh oh
Every little thing...1Embed
