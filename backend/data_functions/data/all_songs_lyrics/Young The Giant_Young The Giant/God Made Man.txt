God Made Man Lyrics
You never know the weight of your crimes
But when all the gates have closed and you're tired
You stand a while by the fire and it burns bright
A while, a while; you sit quiet

Inside, you're so warm
Your eyes open up
To the sunrise, to the sunrise
Far from here

I never know the state that you're in
Oh, it's obvious to climb in your skin
But I know I will walk across
When inside, inside, it feels right

Inside, you're so warm
Your eyes open up
To the sunrise, to the sunrise

'Cause I want you to know that I don't
'Cause I want you to know that I don't
'Cause I want you to know that I don't
'Cause I want you to know that I don't
(God made Man and his reason)
'Cause I want you to know that I don't (God made Man and his reason)
'Cause I want you to know that I don't (God made Man and his reason)
'Cause I want you to know that I don't (God made Man and his reason)
And I want you to know...1Embed
