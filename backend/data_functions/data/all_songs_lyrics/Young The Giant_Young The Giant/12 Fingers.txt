12 Fingers Lyrics
Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh...

Padded by locks, the door knob singed
A rusty close to a door knob hinge
Remembering the sounds
We used to know
But when those sounds sang from our halls
The backstop pressed against bleached walls
Do you remember the sound
Of snow?

And these flames
Boil in reclaim, on the way down

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh
On the way down
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh

Behind the road
You wait for
Love...

So I said follow me down this time
I wrote the rules, but you've got the time
So can you help me?
I've got to break free

From these chains
Oh, from these chains on the way down

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh
On the way down
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh

Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh...

Your eyes are closed before us
Your sighs are all around
Inside, the walls have fallen
And now you're all alone

I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh
On the way down
I can follow you
Your heart beats just like I wanted it to
And you want it, too
Oh-whoa, oh-oh oh
Behind the road
You wait for
Love...

Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Y-yo, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh...3Embed
