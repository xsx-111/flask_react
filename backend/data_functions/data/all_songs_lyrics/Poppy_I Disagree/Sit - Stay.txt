Sit / Stay Lyrics
Every time you fall back down
Sit and stay, lie on the ground
Do what you've been, what you've been told
Sit, stay, lie down
Sit, stay, lie down

Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah

Godspeed to the radio star
Stop the beat when they take it too far
Don't go blind from the stars in your eyes
Welcome to the new starting line
Welcome to the new starting line

Hide your face and don't talk back
I have you now, so face the fact
Do what you've been, what you've been told
Sit, stay, lie down
Sit, stay, lie down

Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah
Godspeed to the radio star
Stop the beat when they take it too far
Don't go blind from the stars in your eyes
Welcome to the new starting line (Ooh-ah)
Welcome to the new starting line (Ooh-ah)
Welcome to the new starting line (Ooh-ah)
Welcome to the new starting line (Ooh-ah)

I will not obey you, I will not obey
I will not obey you, I will not obey6Embed
