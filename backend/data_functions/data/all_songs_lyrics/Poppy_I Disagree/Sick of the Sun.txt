Sick of the Sun Lyrics
I'm sick of the sun
It burns everyone
I want it to go away
I just wanna float away
I'm sick of the sun
Can't trust anyone
I want it to go away
I just wanna float away

Can someone turn the lights down?
Yeah, someone shut the lights out
I close my eyes 'cause it's too bright
Someone turn the lights out, oh
I need to find the right sound
Something I can say that I found
Yeah, I can hear it in my mind
I need to find the right sound, oh

I'm sick of the sun
It burns everyone
I want it to go away
I just wanna float away
I'm sick of the sun
Can't trust anyone
I want it to go away
I just wanna float away
Everyone told me that it would get better
But every day feels exactly the same

I'm sick of the sun
It burns everyone
I want it to go away
I just wanna float away
I'm sick of the sun
Can't trust anyone
I want it to go away
I just wanna float away
I'm sick of the sun13Embed
