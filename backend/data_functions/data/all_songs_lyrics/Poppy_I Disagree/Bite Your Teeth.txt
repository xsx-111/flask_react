Bite Your Teeth Lyrics
Bite your own teeth, bite your own teeth
Don't cry, just bite your own
Bite your own teeth, bite your own teeth
Don't cry, just bite your own

Don't cry, keep on trying
Don't cry, keep on trying to bite
Don't cry, keep on trying
Don't cry, keep on trying to bite

Bite your own teeth, bite your own teeth
Don't ever, ever cry, just bite your own
Bite your own teeth, bite your own teeth
Don't ever, ever cry, just bite your own
Bite your own teeth, bite your own teeth
Don't cry, just bite your own
Bite your own teeth, bite your own teeth
Don't cry, just bite your own

Don't cry, keep on trying
Don't cry, keep on trying to bite
Don't cry, keep on trying
Don't cry, keep on trying to
Creeps are creeping
Teeth are sinking
Into my teeth

Go
