Concrete Lyrics
Bury me six feet deep, bury me six feet deep
Bury me six feet deep, bury me six feet deep
Bury me six feet deep, cover me in concrete
Turn me into a street
Bury me six feet deep, cover me in concrete
Turn me into a street

Chewy, chewy, yummy, yummy, yummy
Sharp and pointy, yummy, yummy, yummy
Break me off a piece of that tasty treat
Sugar in my teeth, demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep for eternity

Bury me six feet deep, cover me in concrete
Turn me into a street
(Ah, ah)

Some people like candy
Some people like coffee
But these lifeless flavors don't satisfy me
I tried to eat ice cream
I tried to drink tea (Ooh la-la-la)
But I need the taste of young blood in my teeth
(Ooh, ah)
Chewy, chewy, yummy, yummy, yummy
Sharp and pointy, yummy, yummy, yummy
Break me off a piece of that tasty treat
Sugar in my teeth, demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep for eternity
Sugar in my teeth, demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep for eternity

Poppy, Poppy, Poppy
Poppy, Poppy, Poppy

Bury me six feet deep and just cover me in concrete, please
Turn me into a street, turn me into a street
I don't wanna wait forever and ever, please
Turn me into a street, turn me into a street (Ah, ooh)
Turn me into a street, turn me into a street (Ah, ooh)
(Poppy, Poppy, Poppy, Poppy)
Turn me into a street, turn me into a street63Embed
