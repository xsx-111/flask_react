Nothing I Need Lyrics
Something strange happened to me
All I ever wanted, it was nothing I need
Doesn't matter to me
It don't matter to me
When I said that I'm okay
All the power that you had, it just slipped away
Doesn't matter to me
It don't matter to me

Take the ride
Take the ride, take the ride
Take the ride, take the ride
Take the ride, oh-woah-woah-woah

Always gotta climb the ladder
Someone else will always do it, they'll do it better
Here's your prize for competition
They would die for your position
Everything I thought I wanted
I can see it's nothing, nothing I need
I'm not gonna ask permission
I'll never ask permission
Take the ride
Take the ride, take the ride
Take the ride, take the ride
Take the ride, oh-woah-woah-woah11Embed
