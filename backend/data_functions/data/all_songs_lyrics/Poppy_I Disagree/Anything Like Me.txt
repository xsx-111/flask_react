Anything Like Me Lyrics
I feel her heart beating in me
Get her out of me

Sorry for what I've become
Because I'm becoming someone
Your hand on my neck, you call up the press
Die for the attention
You pray for a reaction
I'll stop when it's no more fun
If this is the start, then let's see how far
You're gonna take this one

You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You'll never be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me

This isn't a fight to be won
Go on and give up the gun
If this is a test, with all due respect
You're not gonna fool no one
I'm everything she never was
Now everyone's out for my blood
Stop, you're making a scene
You're coming at me with blood in your teeth
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You'll never be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
I feel her heart beating in me
Get her out of me
Love is never-ending in me
Take it out of me
Take it out of me
Take it out of me
Out of me

You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You shouldn't be anything like me
You'll never be anything like me8Embed
