Policeman LyricsWe can see you creeping, Mr.Policeman
Looking through the keyhole in the door
Taking notes of all that floats
With the beat your marching feet
Shiny shoes, looking for clues
Do come in, we'll offer you a rissole
If you will only blow your whistle for me
And then we'll be good, I know we should
Take the time to change our minds
We will pay our parking fines - soon!
I'm the same as you, please Mr.Policeman
It's just, I'd like to stay behind my door
You can't stop me laughing Mr.Policeman
You'd better find out what I'm smiling for
No, I haven't broke the law
Hey man, don't put me in your van
Please see it's free, I wanna be to dig the scene
Ah, weed the green
Oh, forty people more locked behind the door in the bathroom
Hope you don't go in for at least an hour
They're taking it in turns to have a shower
We can see you creeping, Mr.Policeman
Looking through the keyhole in our door
Taking notes of all that floats
With the beat your marching feet
Shiny shoes, looking for clues
Do come in, we'll offer you a rissole
If you will only blow your whistle for me
And then we'll be good, I know we should
Take the time to change our minds
We will pay our parking fines soon!Embed
