Love Song with Flute LyricsWhen I've got time on my side, there's nothing I can do
To escape from the scenes that have been making me want you
So I think of the dreams that I've had, and what's left I'd like to do
But my mind draws a blind over me and all I see is you
Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Listen to me now
I'm needing you - though it may not seem to be
I'm needing you - you're all I care to see
I'm needing you - and you, and you...
I can feel the sun in my hair when I'm sitting here with you
Who cares if I'm lost in my mind? My dreams are overdue
I've been living more for myself than I've ever done before
And my feeling's so real over you, I keep coming back for more
When I look at me, all that I feel
And all I see is you
So look into my eyes
I'm needing you - though it may not seem to be
I'm needing you - you're all I care to see
I'm needing you - and you, and you...Embed
