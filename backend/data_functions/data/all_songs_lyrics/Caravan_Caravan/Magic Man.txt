Magic Man LyricsSittin' in my treetop world, doing nothing at all
Just floating in the sky, I'm free
Envy me all you want, it don't mean a thing
But join me anytime, if you please
I'm lazy I know, but I do anything that I want to do
Fly to my arms and feel your fantasies coming through
I'm a magic man on a sea, in the sky
A magic man on a sea, in the sky
Join me and see... in the sky
I know that I am not too far away for you to come to
There ain't a storm that my ship can't carry you through
I know that you know in your mind that I'm right, it's good to be free
Soft Machines, Heart Club Bands and all are welcome here with me
I'm lazy I know, but I do anything that I want to do
Fly to my arms and feel your fantasies coming through
I'm a magic man on a sea, in the sky
A magic man on a sea, in the sky
Join me and see... in the skyEmbed
