Ride LyricsHere am I, alone in your sky
With my mind passing by the thoughts in your eye
If I were you, and you were me
Could you feel how unreal your world seems to be?
Oh please, don't mind that I'm here
For who am I when you're near?
I'll try to find a place in my mind
Where you know you can go, and leave all behind
How does it feel when a dream seems so real
And you fly through my eye on a steel rainbow wheel?
Searching my mind for thoughts left behind
Let you feel you're concealed by a smile-coloured blind
Oh please, don't mind that I'm here
For who am I when you're near?
I'll try to find a place in my mind
Where you know you can go, and leave all behindEmbed
