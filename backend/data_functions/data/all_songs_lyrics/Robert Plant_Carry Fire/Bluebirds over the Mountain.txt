Bluebirds over the Mountain LyricsBluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me
Boy and girl, they fell in love
Each was like the hands above
He looked in the eyes of blue
She vowed to him that she'd be true
Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby back to me
(Well, well, well, well)
I miss you, oh, can't you see?
You're the only one for me
Since you've gone, I'm all alone
C'mon, baby, come back home
Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Come on and bring my baby back to me
Bring my baby back to me
Bring my baby, my my my my...
Bring her back to me
Bring her back to me
Bring her back to meEmbed
