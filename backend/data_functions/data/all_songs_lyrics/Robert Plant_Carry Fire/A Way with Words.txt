A Way with Words Lyrics
Leave me here alone
For just as long as it takes
The seasons turn
Waiting for the weather to break
Blowing up a storm now
Many times I fell from grace
The seasons turn
Once again our world will change

Reaching out to find you
I put it all behind you
I'm back again, I know
Across miles I find you
I put it all behind you
I'm back again, I know

Coming from the cold
Reaching for your sweet embrace
The seasons turn
Beyond your world I wait
Is your heart still warm?
Little flame, a special place
The seasons turn
Once again our world will change
Reaching out to find you
Put it all behind you
I'm back again, I know
Crossing miles to find you
Put it all behind you
I'm back again, I know

Are we built but falling down
Holding you and hit the ground
I know
Blaming tears, lonesome sound
Hopes and fears will burn the ground
I know

(Oh) Reaching out to find you
(Oh) I put it all behind you
(Oh) I'm back again, I know
(Oh) Across the miles I find you
(Oh) I, I put it all behind you
(Oh) I'm back again, back again, I'm back

I'm reaching out to find you
I put it all behind you
'Cause I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back
(Oh) Reaching out to find you
(Oh) I put it all behind you
(Oh) I'm back again, I know
Back again, I know

(Mmm, Mmm, mmm
Mmm, Mmm, mmm)Embed
