The May Queen LyricsLay down in sweet surrender
Your love so warm and tender
(Ahh) Oh, sweet surrender, now
(Ahh) So warm and tender, now
(Ahh) Oh-oh-oh
(Ahh) Oh
Inside my waves are breaking
Oh, light of my salvation
(Ahh) Oh, my waves are breaking now
(Ahh) Ooh, sweet salvation now
(Ahh) Oh-oh-oh
(Ahh) Oh
Iâ€™m seeking love and glory
Just like I always do
The bosom of the freedom
I very rarely choose
Out here the fire's still burning
So long into my night
Still captive and still yearning
Surrender to your light
A heart that never falters
A love that never dies
I linger in the shadows
The dimming of my light, oh
The dimming of my light
The dimming of my light
The dimming of my light2Embed
