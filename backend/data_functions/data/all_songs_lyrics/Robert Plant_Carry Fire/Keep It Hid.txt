Keep It Hid LyricsWhat you gonna do when it's cold outside?
And who'll keep you warm when the sun don't shine?
And who you gonna call when the day is done?
And who you gonna rock when your mother's gone?
Now baby, take the wine from the loving cup
Mama, take your time, don't you spill a drop
Find little mama and I'll be your kid
Keep it to yourself, baby, keep it hid
To yourself, baby, keep it hid
Keep it to yourself, baby, keep it hid
To yourself, baby, keep it hid
Mmm
Uh
Oh
Uh
Baby, take some time, like to walk by the sea
See, I got some trouble in my life in the minor key
At the edge of the world when the sun comes up
There's a silver key in a golden cup
Silver key in a golden cup
Silver key in a golden cup
Silver key in a golden cup
Mmm
Mmm
Uh
Oh
Silver key in a golden cup
Silver key in a gold, ohEmbed
