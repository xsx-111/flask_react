Carving Up the World Again... A Wall and Not a Fence LyricsThe Russians, the Americans, the British and the French
They're carving up the world again, it's getting kinda tense
A whole lotta posture and very little sense
It's no surprise they hide behind a wall and not a fence
The Irish and the English and the Scottish and the Welsh
A damp and misty history they keep it to themselves
All lost in dark antiquity and smoldering descent
Invisible division behind a wall and not a fence
Trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
Ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
Call up the cavalry and double up the guard
Preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards
In China they got worried, so they built themselves a wall
They built it big and long and tall to keep away the hoard
A hundred years of blood and toil, a million lives expend
The steely grip of dynasty behind a wall and not a fence
Trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
Ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
Call up the cavalry and double up the guard
Preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards
Trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
Ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
Call up the cavalry and double up the guard
Preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards
Emperors and sultans, kings and presidents
Dictators and ambassadors engaged in our defense
A lifetime of great service of selfless good intent
Guaranteed immunity behind a wall and not a fence
Trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
Ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
Call up the cavalry and double up the guard
Preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cards
Trouble at the border in the eleventh hour
Ditch and wire and palisades in the line of fire
Call up the cavalry and double up the guard
Preparing for catastrophe inside the house of cardsEmbed
