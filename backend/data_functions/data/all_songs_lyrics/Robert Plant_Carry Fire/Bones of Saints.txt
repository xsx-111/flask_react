Bones of Saints Lyrics
They're loading up in the ships
They're loading up the planes
There's madness in the sky
Above the bones of saints
So much of me is broken
The servants of a lie
Now everything is burning
There's a fire up in the sky

And I said, no no no no
No no no no no

We’re up against the bench
While all the walls fall down
I hear the children scream
But then the fear abound
And that’s the leading question
Where all the money comes
I’ll say who makes the bullets
If you tell me who sells the guns
And I said, no no no no
No no no no no
No no no no
No no no no no

In the Garden of Eden
And the wheels go round and round
The sight of an angel
When the best fair deals come down
In the Garden of Eden
And the wheels go round and round
The sight of an angel
When the best fair deals come down


No no no no
No no no no no
No no no no
No no no no no

No
No
