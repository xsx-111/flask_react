Dance with You Tonight LyricsAnd now the carnival is over
Someone turned out the light
Our fields of plenty filled with clover
So long ago and out of sight
This little light that keeps on shining
All through the darkness, through the night
That ever more will keep reminding
Our journey's long; the flame is bright
And if there's one more time I can dance with you
Let me dance with you tonight
It's the last chance our hearts will dance
Into the lovers' night
Out in the land of never ending
The rich parade the roar of life
We shared a world forever changing
Through dancing days and wondrous nights
I offer up the secret places
Reveal the magic of the land
All bound by blood and lipstick traces
Till time conspired to steal our crown
And if there's one more time I can dance with you
Let me dance with you tonight
It's the last chance for our hearts to dance
Into the lovers' night
And if there's one more time I can dance with you
Let me dance with you tonight
It's the last chance for our hearts to dance
Into the lovers' night
Come on and dance another mile
Come on and wear your late, late smile
The flame still burning bright
Across the days, across the years
If there's one more, only one more
Only one more night
Come on and dance with me, baby
Make me feel alrightEmbed
