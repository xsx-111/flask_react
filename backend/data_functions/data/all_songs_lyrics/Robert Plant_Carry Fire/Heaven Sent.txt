Heaven Sent LyricsThere’s an angel at the gate singing
A stolen kiss, a fall from grace singing out
He's heaven sent
He feeds the flame of everlasting love
His empire falls, his spell will break
Once cast aside, his song awakes
He's heaven sent
He rides the waves of freedom's golden flood
Now shadows fall, the hour is late
Still hear your songs but time won’t wait
Once heaven sent above the world
The eagle and the dove
All that's worth the doing
Is seldom easy done
All that's worth the winning
Is never easy won
All the long goodbyes
All the goodbye songs
All the love for giving
Never really gone
All that's worth the doing
Is seldom easy done
All that’s worth the winning
Is never easy won
All the long goodbyes
All the goodbye songs
Spend the time forgiving
Never really done
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Never really doneEmbed
