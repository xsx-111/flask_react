Carry Fire LyricsI sit and wait for you like so many others do
Just like they do for me, well, so I do for you
I'd carry fire for you
Here in my naked hands
I'd bare my heart to you
If you will understand
I was a stranger there inside your promised land
That turned me inside out and turned me upside down
I'd carry fire for you
Here in my naked hand
I'd bare my heart to you
If you will understand
Just like, just like
Just like I scarred you
Just like, just like
Just like I scarred you
I'm reaching out for you across the broken gate
I feel the gathering years beyond these lonely waves
I'd carry fire for you
Here in my naked hands
I'd bare my heart to you
If you will understand
Just like, just like
Just like I scarred you
Just like, just like
Just like I scarred youEmbed
