Hymn for an Average Man Lyrics
Somewhere down along the line I lost the plot
You think nothing has changed?
Horrified to find that what you made has risen up
And now your hate has a name

So let a sigh ring out Denial
Deny it, deny it

Draw a cold hand across your mouth
A muffled sound
While you lie there and wait
Listen to them calling out and come for you in silence
For the mess that you have made

So let a sigh ring out Denial
Deny it, deny it
So let a sigh ring out Denial
Deny it, deny it
(Ignore their screaming. You got away with it.)

Nothing is opened up
No sound in the room
Nothing is opened up
No sound in the room1Embed
