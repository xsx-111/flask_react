Cleveland Lyrics
I never saw your face but I can tell
You're there and just waiting at the Right Hand
Satan laughs but I can swear
I hear all the saints on their way down

Here come the Shirts in Brown and Black
With the flashing lights
They're hiding
In different colors in the dead of night
They're running Waller County, Texas where 4,000 died
And down in Jackson, Mississippi they don't have to hide

But innocence is alive and it's coming back one day

Here come the(m) boys in black and white
With the kerosene
It's been the same evil power since in ‘63
They hang in Homewood, Alabama with the whitest sheets
And in Montgomery County, Maryland from a sapling tree

But innocence is alive and it's coming back one day
I don't think you're gonna get away now
With the Seal I can hear them singing
Kindra Chapman (We're coming back)
Brother Andre Jones (We're coming back)
Lennon Lacy (We're coming back)
Sandra Bland (We're coming back)
Roosevelt Pernell (We're coming back)
Brother Keith Warren (We're coming back)
Brother Alfred Wright (We're coming back)
We're coming back and any day now — it won't be long…

The hand that brings the gavel down is the hand that ties the noose
The hand that finds you behind and ties the thirteen loops
But that hand is gonna fold - the day is coming soon
When we fill it full of dust and resurrect the truth

'Cause innocence is alive and it's coming back one day1Embed
