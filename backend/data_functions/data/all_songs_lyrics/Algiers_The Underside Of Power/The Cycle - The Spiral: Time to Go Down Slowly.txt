The Cycle / The Spiral: Time to Go Down Slowly Lyrics
Oh sugar, I go lost inside it till there ain't nothing to gain
I can't stop going in and out of focus while you wait for the change
This is total war on a promise
Wail against the wall
No, it's never over
And it never ends

We are the cycle that begins
We are the spiral to the end
We are the cycle that begins
We are the spiral to the end

Oh, baby I know how to die
I don't know how to forgive
I cried out for power
Someday I will find it
While you wait for the end
This is total war on a promise
Wail against the wall
No it never ends
It takes you over and overâ€¦

The cycle that begins
We are the spiral to the end
We are the cycle that begins
We are the spiral to the end
Until the second it's over
That's twice you died and you'll die some more
Until the second it's over
That's twice you died and you'll die some more
On the second it's over
When He says it's over

Time to go down now slowly
Time to go now, where everything's lost
You'll find Hell where you fought love
You'll find Hell when it falls apart
Time to go down now slowly
Time to go now, where everything's lost
You'll find Hell where you fought love
You'll find Hell when it falls apart
Time to go down now slowly
Time to go now, where everything's lost
You'll find Hell where you fought love
You'll find Hell when it falls apart
Time to go down now slowly
Time to go now, where everything's lost
You'll find Hell where you fought love
You'll find Hell when it falls apartEmbed
