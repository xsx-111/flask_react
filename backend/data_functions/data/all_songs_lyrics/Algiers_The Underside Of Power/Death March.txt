Death March Lyrics
Oh no
On no, no, no
This can't be how it all falls apart
Constant fear of explosion
Crypto-fascist contagion

Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
They took no time to unwind it all
Manufactured suggestion
Wag the dog and then drown him

How hate keeps passing on
This is how the hate keeps passing on

Oh no
On no, no, no
This can't be how it all whimpers out
Live to die in the gutter
Empty ivory towers

Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
They pay no mind just to wind you up
Informed autosuggestion
State-sanctioned assassination
How hate keeps passing on
This is how the hate keeps passing on
How hate keeps passing on
This is how the hate keeps passing onEmbed
