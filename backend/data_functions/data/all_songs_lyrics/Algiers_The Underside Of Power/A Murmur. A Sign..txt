A Murmur. A Sign. Lyrics
You won't see me there
You won't see me there
You won't see me there
You won't see me there

I won't come around till the morning
(You won't see me there)
You won't see me there, and a smile on her face
(You won't see me there)
Though the sun also rises
Sons won't have no one to hold on (You won't see me there)
Call your name
(You won't see me there)

Will you take it slow
(Take it slow)
Where you go
(Where you go)
In the heat sugar
Moving down the line
(Move, Move, Move, Move)

I won't come around till there's morning
You won't see me there, and a smile on her face
Though the sun also rises, sons won't have no one to hold on
Call your name
Will you take it slow
(Take it slow)
Where you go
(Where you go)
In the heat sugar (You won't see me there)
Moving down the line

I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it (You won't see me there)
I can't go on (Move)
I'm lost without it (You won't see me there)
I can't go on (Move)
I'm lost without it (You won't see me there)
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I say I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it
I can't go on
I'm lost without it, lost without it, lost without...1Embed
