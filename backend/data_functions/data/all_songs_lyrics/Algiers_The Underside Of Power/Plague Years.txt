Plague Years LyricsSo many hiding places
Sex workers on the ring line
No solution just glossy traces
I wear her hair to the Negro races
So many glossy faces
Stigma
My stigma black night into day
Payday barter false friend wasting away
Down hill shepherds fell crossroads betrayed
And in the blaze we onstage panic play
Wasting awayEmbed
