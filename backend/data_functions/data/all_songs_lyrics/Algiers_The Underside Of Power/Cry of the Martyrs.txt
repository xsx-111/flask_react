Cry of the Martyrs Lyrics
With the world to win behind us
Our hands shorn for all to see
There's still the dirt with our bodies to remind us
Of our defeat at Calvary
They'll say our whole life is a locust
Disturbing their fractious peace
But it is they who mangle our horizons
Of our defeat at Calvary

But I see the light and I see the sea
Despite the future crashing down and closing over me
I got power over all my enemies
Listen to the martyrs cry for me

I see the light and I see the sea
The sun is going down but it won't ease the burning
I've seen it written on the other side of history
Listen to the martyrs cry for me

With the world to win behind us
Our hands shorn for all to see
There's still the dirt with our bodies to remind us
Of our defeat at Calvary
They'll say our whole life is a locust
Disturbing their fractious peace
But it is they who mangle our horizons
Of our defeat at Calvary
There are histories of violence
Reduce our memories to silence
Repressing all the stories of the unsung and unseen
Listen to the martyrs cry for me

I see the light and I see the sea
I'm ready for the spiral down
I'm waiting for perdition
But I can't carry myself down to die in peace
Listen to the martyrs cry

With the world to win behind us
Our hands shorn for all to see
There's still the dirt with our bodies to remind us
Of our defeat at Calvary
They'll say our whole life is a locust
Disturbing their fractious peace
But it is they who mangle our horizons
Of our defeat at Calvary1Embed
