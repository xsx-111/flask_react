I Just Grew Tired LyricsSo many problems
So many dreams, so many hangdog faces
So many ways to say
"Oh! I'll never see another day with you in it."
So listen while you can
The first time that you ever have
I just grew tired
Grew tired, grew tired of it
I just grew tired
Grew tired, grew tired
I can count your saving graces on two fingers
Love them, sit on them
You told me that you're not afraid to die
And dying's easy, life that's hard
I don't believe a word
So listen while you can
The first time that you ever have
I just grew tired
Grew tired, grew tired of it
I just grew tired
Grew tired, grew tired
So listen while you can
The first time that you ever have
Life's not easy
But it's all you have
So I can count on you
Don't ever, never, never, never, never
Let it split away
And dying's easy?
I think I'll try it out today!
(I just grew tired)
Grew tired, grew tired of it
I just grew tired
Grew tired, grew tired
I just grew tired
Grew tired, grew tired
I just grew tired
Grew tired, grew tired
Of love, love, love, love, love, love, loveEmbed
