Just Making Memories LyricsSeeing you
I knew why I'd come so far
And I thanked the stars
For leading me to you
Your fairy tale prince
I'm trying so hard
To make like an orchard
In my own back yard
Oh the rain dribbles down
Me in my beatitude
My collar and shirt
Down legs to battered shoes
Life is a breeze!
I'm just making memories
Good times or bad
(I'm making, I'm making)
I'm just making memories
You're the best that I've had
And I'm still living
My teenage angst
On the printed page
And in other ways
So if I seem cruel
It's only the fool in me
That wants to try
And see if you'll cry
Oh the rain dribbles down
Me in my beatitude
My collar and shirt
Down legs to battered shoes
Life is a breeze!
I'm just making memories
Good times or bad
(I'm making, I'm making)
I'm just making memories
You're the best that I've had
I'm just making memories
Good times or bad
(I'm making, I'm making)
I'm just making memories
You're the best that I've had
Uh I'm just making memories
Good times or bad
(I'm making, I'm making)
I'm just making memories
You're the best that I've had
I'm just making memories
Good times or bad
(I'm making, I'm making)
I'm just making memories
You're the best that I've had
No need to ask why
I'm mischief and joy
I'm still the tall boy
Who just wouldn't crawl
I'm just making memories
Good times or bad
No need to ask you're the best
You're the best that I've had
(I'm just making memories)
I'm just making memories
You're the best that I've had
I'm just making memories
Good times or bad
(I'm making, I'm making)
I'm just making memories
You're the best that I've had
I'm just making memories
Good times or bad
(I'm making, I'm making)
I'm just making memories
You're the best that I've hadEmbed
