Hardly Star-Crossed Lovers LyricsI used to hide
I used to cry a lot
But now I don't
It's you, you
When you smile
The whole world's sky
When you smile
I'm a star in that sky
It's you, it's you
And we're barely friends
We're hardly star-crossed lovers
But who cares?
It's you, it's you
When you smile
The whole world's sky
When you smile
I'm a star in that sky
It's you, it's you
It's youEmbed
