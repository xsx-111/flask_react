Sometimes For The Asking LyricsSometimes you laugh
Sometimes we smile at each other
Sometimes you give a lot
When really you'd rather not
And sometimes you pray
Sometimes you tell a lie
Sometimes you take a hold
Of this your living day
So many dreams for the asking
And I'll wager there's one here who'll try
To make a fool of you
You're crying out for more
More, more, more, more
Sometimes you laugh
Sometimes we smile at each other
Sometimes you give a lot
When really you'd rather not
And sometimes you pray
And sometimes you tell a lie
Sometimes you take a hold
Of this your living day
So many dreams for the asking
And I'll wager there's one here who'll try
To make a fool of you
You're crying out for more
More, more, more, more
So many dreams for the asking
And I'll wager there's one here who'll try
To make a man of you
You're crying out for more
More, more, more, more
So many dreams for the asking
And I'll wager there's one here who'll try
To make a fool of you
You're crying out for more
More, more, more, more
So many dreams for the asking
And I'll wager there's one here who'll try
To make a man of you
You're crying out for more
More, more, more, moreEmbed
