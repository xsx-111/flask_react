Blue LyricsIt’s time to shout
It’s time to let them know what we’re about
As winter kisses frosty cold and hard to hands
I’ll waste not an ounce of my time
Now that summer’s in time
To hold back the night
Keep me up from the fire
Back to the wheel
Don’t look down
Don’t ever let them know you’re down
For if we are, we are
If we’re not, so what?
I’ll waste not an ounce of my time
Now that summer’s in time
To hold back the night
Keep me up from the fire
Back to the wheel
Speak in my ear
Speak in my ear
You’re living a lie
You’re living a lie
No you can’t here
No you can’t here
Out from the fire
Out from here
Hell on the way
There’s hell on the wayEmbed
