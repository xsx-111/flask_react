Ravel In The Rain LyricsNow it's complete
Ravel is in the rain
Standing in my dream street
I'd like to meet
Ravel in New Orleans
Hold out my hand to his
I was warned, now I'm old
Still searching for what I'm told
Is gone, is God, is not
Don't try to leave
I've tried so many times
The street is named desire
I was warned, now I'm old
Still searching for what I'm told
Is gone, is God, is not
I was warned, now I'm old
Still searching for what I'm told
Is gone, is God, is notEmbed
