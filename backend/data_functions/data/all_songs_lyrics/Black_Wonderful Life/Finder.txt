Finder LyricsBaby
Once more I won't ask again
Don't tell me I should count to ten
Think freely
I won't attempt to curb your speech
It sounds like something out of reach
Oh, it's crazy
When I think of how I feel so free
Maybe there is something wrong with me
Could be!
(Finder)
Oh I never seem to know when I will find her
I am the (finder)
And that's fine by me
And that's fine by me
Bingo!
You've said it, you don't care to play
Just drag on through another day
Oh, maybe
It's time you learn to play the fool
Break some of your silly rules
Oh, and someday
When you think you can't do anymore
I'll be lying here to break your fall
So small
(Finder)
Oh I never seem to know when I will find her
I am the (finder)
And that's fine by me
That's fine by me
(Finder)
Oh I never seem to know when I will find her
I am the (finder)
And that's fine by me
And that's fine by me
(solo)
(Finder)
Oh I never seem to know when I will find her
I am the (finder)
And that's fine by me
That's fine by me
(Finder)
Oh I never seem to know when I will find her
I am the (finder)
And that's fine by me
And that's fine by me
(Finder)
Oh I never seem to know when I will find her
I am the (finder)
And that's fine by me
And that's fine by meEmbed
