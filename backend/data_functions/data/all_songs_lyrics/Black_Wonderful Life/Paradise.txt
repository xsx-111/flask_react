Paradise LyricsI feel the weight of your heart
And I know a way it can change
I know the weight of your heart
I know a way we can rise
Just hold my hand and we can make it to paradise
Just slip inside and we can make it to paradise
Because, just like a forming rainbow
Just like the stars in the sky
Life should never feel small
We are losers now
It wouldn’t hurt to try
Oh wrap me up in passioned arms
And tell me, tell me you love
For I need to know if we’re to get to paradise
Just take my hand and we can make it to paradise
Because, just like a forming rainbow
Just like the stars in the sky
Life should never feel small
And we roll and dive and laugh and cry about it
Right out into paradise
Just like a forming rainbow
Just like the stars in the sky
Life should never feel small
Oh, never feel small
And we roll and dive and laugh and cry about itEmbed
