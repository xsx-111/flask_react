Leave Yourself Alone LyricsNot for nothing at all
Not for nothing did I call
Reason is: you're often appalled
Hold on now John, you never seemed cold!
I thought you were in love
Then I guess that you're not
Ah, but then the first thing you wrote
Was: Hold on now John
Hold on now John
Hold on now John
And now you don't answer when I call
You don't answer then
You don't answer when I call
Leave yourself alone
Leave yourself alone
Cabbages and kings in your dreams
These are your dreams
Maybe they're not quite what they seem
Hold on now John
The blame is undone
Wash up the air
Don't drive that car
Never learn to play the guitar
And leave yourself alone
Leave yourself alone
Leave yourself alone
And leave yourself alone
You don't answer when I call
You don't answer then
You don't answer when I call
Leave yourself alone
Leave yourself alone
You don't answer when I call
You don't answer then
You don't answer when I call
Leave yourself alone
Leave yourself alone
Sweeping up the ashes of rock
Sweeping up the ashes of roll
Years begin to take up their toll
Though not for some
You've never seemed cold
You don't answer when I call
You don't answer then
You don't answer when I call
Hold on now John
Hold on now John
You don't answer when I call
You don't answer then
You don't answer when I call
Leave yourself alone
Leave yourself aloneEmbed
