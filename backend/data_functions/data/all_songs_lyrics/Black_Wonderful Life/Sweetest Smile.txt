Sweetest Smile LyricsI think my heart must be made of clay
'Cause everyone said it would be broken some day
And now I've come to that fateful day
So I sit on the floor with my head in my hands
And don't tell me how to make it pay
I write a new song every day
I just wish I was made of wood
I might not feel pain, even if I should
Even if I should
If I should
The sweetest smile that ever did
Melt the pats in the butter dish
And if you could have believed in me
I swear to God I'd have made damn sure
Our hearts were warm
And glad with wine
I'd keep the doors locked all the time
I just wish I was made of wood
You might not seem glad
Even if you should
Even if you should
If you should
If you should
If you should
I think my heart must be made of clay
'Cause everyone said it would be broken someday
Seems like I have come to that fateful day
So I sit on the floor with my head in my hands
With my head in my hands
If I should
If I should
If I should
If I shouldEmbed
