Sixteens LyricsYou don't follow me now
Ribbons in hair
Searching for answers when
There's none there
Then follow me round
Up my stair
Into my bedroom if
I'm in there
Hoping for something
Because it seems the right thing to do
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You still follow me now
Temptingly fair
Finding your answers when
There's none there
Hoping for something
Because it seems the right thing to do
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know what to do then
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)Embed
