Enough LyricsAlright, you're right
Let's talk it over now
Talk it over now
I'm wrong, you're gone
So you're serious
Really serious
You're saying I'm insane
Oh that's craziness
Craziness
I'm trying to find
Its real meaning
Insanity
When I get home again
Everything we said
It seemed to hold us
Back again, again
When I get home then
We try to make it better
In the same
Damn way again, again
So long, you're gone
You'r really leaving me, leaving
There's no prize for goodbyes
No joy either, either
You're saying I'm insane
Oh that's craziness
Craziness
I'm trying to find
Its real meaning
Insanity
When I get home again
Everything we said
It seemed to hold us
Back again, again
When I get home then
We try to make it better
In the same
Damn way again, again
Enough
I've had enough
Oh I'm leavingEmbed
