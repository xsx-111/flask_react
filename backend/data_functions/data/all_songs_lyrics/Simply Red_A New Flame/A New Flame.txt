A New Flame Lyrics
I was bowled out
I was sold down the river
But her warm heart
Would turn me forever
She's turned me round

A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
I am stern now
Petty words
Don't believe me
But her warm smile
Is never gonna leave me
Cause she's turned me round
But a new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong - oh, no
Wrong - oh, no
Wrong - oh, no
Wrong - oh, no
Wrong - oh, no
Alright
She's made of real glass
She got real real emotion
But my heart laughs
I have that same sweet devotion
Cause she's turned me round
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong
A new flame has come
And nothing she can do can do me wrong - oh, no
Wrong - oh, no, wrong - oh, no
Nothing she can do can ever do me wrong
Wrong - oh, no, wrong - oh, no
Nothing she can do can never do me wrong
Wrong - oh, no, wrong - oh, no
Nothing she can do can ever do me wrong
Wrong - oh, no, wrong - oh, no
Nothing she can do can ever do me wrong
Wrong - oh, no, wrong - oh, no
Nothing, no, no, no
Nothing, no, no, no
Nothing, no, no, no
Nothing, no, no, noEmbed
