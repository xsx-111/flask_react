To Be With You LyricsI can't pronounce it
Don't even understand
The words I mean
My tongue's tied
Up around it
My brain is so tired
But my heart is so warm
I wanna be with you
To talk with you
To sleep with you
Most of all
To make love to you
Last night I dreamed about it
The rooms in these hotels
Are the same around the world
I could really do without it
I'll only hate myself
If I take another girl
I wanna be with you
I wanna talk with you
I wanna sleep with you
Most of all
To make love to you
Oh if I ever get home again
If you could ever
Do the same thing too
I could open up my soul again
I have to get this message to you
I wanna be with you
I wanna talk with you
I wanna sleep with you
I wanna make love to you
Love to you
You've got that feeling inside
And you know
My joy just can't hideEmbed
