He Likes the Sun Lyrics
Some say the world goes crazy
At summertime
I say I'm feeling lazy
Hammocks in mind
And I can't change a thing
So I won't stay around
If you can still feel so hot
Why don't you feel for me?
If you can feel so much
Why don't you let it out
And let me be alone again?
I keep watch
That's all right
'Cause it comes
In this real night

He likes the sun
See the cornered clown
He likes the sun
Let us waste this town
And when it rains
You feel the click in his heart
And that's when the pain in mine will start
And that's when the pain in mine will start
I'm used to growing older
And feeling down inside
But, yes, I know, well, someone told
You should have seen him cry
Well, that's not my life
I'm tired of chip inside
And playing bronze for cool
Y'know that sometimes light
And sometimes you can just be that fool
Who can really say?
If I'm cross
It's a joke
If I'm lost
Let it go up in smoke, yes

He likes the sun
See the cornered clown
He likes the sun
Let us waste this town
And when it rains
You feel the click in his heart
And that's when the pain in mine will start
And that's when the pain in mine will start
Jump right out of your grass colours
And make like you were easy prey
And cheer us solemn of a possible
Is it possible?
I could really play, I could really play
All these things I say
Though not torn inside
Though not torn inside
You just lie, lie low
Lie low for me

I'm not in deeper waters
Where everyone will claim
We used to know the daughter
Throw it away
It's not such a shame
If you're feeling blue
And I like icy looks and great command
He likes the way I'm true
But I know inside this is a
Real life sham
But that's okay
And this song
Can't be sued
I assume
You get up and renew yourself
He likes the sun
See the cornered clown
He likes the sun
Let us waste this town
And when it rains
You feel the click in his heart
And that's when the pain in mine will start
And that's when the pain in mine will startEmbed
