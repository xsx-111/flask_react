I Love You Lyrics
Johnny was
A peculiar guy
Brought up on love
And the reasons why
But the reasons why
Ought not to be said
And so I'm left
Hands held to my head
He says:
I love you
I love you
I love you
And it's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing
It's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing

Chances, changes
Are all that you have
As you take the hard stuff
Lie on your back
The smoothness, strangeness
Fits like a glove
But the comfort of tease
Well rises above
Saying:
I love you
I love you
I love you
But is it possible, possible, possible, babe?
Is it possible for me and you?
Is it possible, possible, possible, babe?
Is it possible for me and you?


Gold and waves and Betty Blue
Are the images
That lead to the clues of why
I can't love you
I can't love you
I can't love you
It is impossible, possible, possible, babe
It's impossible for me and you
It is impossible, possible, possible, babe
It is impossible for me and youEmbed
