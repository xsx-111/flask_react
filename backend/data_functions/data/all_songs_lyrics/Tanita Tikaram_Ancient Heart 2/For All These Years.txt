For All These Years Lyrics
I got a scent on you
I got something here to show
It's somebody's slice of life
I had it tailor-made
I had it soaken, shaken and
Shown around the world
And all of these things you tell me
I can't quite believe
You are still there and I'm still trying
To be somebody

Always on the upkeep
Always trying to reach the rest of us
We don't have anything to say, nothing to give
Well, life it blows away
I have another chance, I may have two lives
But both my lives will be brief lives
And then
You all will wonder why
I was only 16 years old
You were only 17
Life isn't so complicated
But then life isn't s'posed to be
For all these years
For all these years

Could somebody tell them
To hurry on, hurry on down?
Can somebody tell them
To hurry on, hurry on?

Every censor, everybody loses their way
I have a wealth of material
I have a well of people to share with you
Every lover
Well they all tell lies
I have his wife in the background
But I have more than this, I have more than this
And if Mr Chaste
He has a past
Give it to me

I was only 16 years old
You were only 17
Life isn't so complicated
But then life isn't s'posed to be
For all these years
For all these yearsEmbed
