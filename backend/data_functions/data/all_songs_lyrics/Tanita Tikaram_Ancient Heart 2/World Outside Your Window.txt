World Outside Your Window Lyrics
Well, everyone has said
That I might go
'Cause my red suitcase and my Ray-Bans
Weren't quite so
I'd bear the heavy wind and rain that falls
I'll never come back again
'Cause you know how I laugh
When winter shows her hand

Well, that picture frame
Is the saddest thing you'll see
But it bought me time
And a place that love could be
And since I'm going now, please rearrange
'Cause I'd like to think that
Things have changed
I don't believe you'll be open anymore

So, tell me if you want to see
A world outside your window
A world outside your window isn't free
Oh, and tell me if you want to catch
That feeling of redemption
That feeling of redemption don't do much for me

Well, everyone was hoping
You would stay awhile
Tell us 'bout that great land
In the south
Then ya see that man
Now, ain't he under offer?
Well, I tell you, child
You go wash out your mouth

So, tell me if you want to see
A world outside your window
A world outside your window isn't free
Oh, and tell me if you want to catch
That feeling of redemption
That feeling of redemption don't do much for me

Now what can you say
I'm hiding in the belfry?
How can you say
I wanna catch time?
How can you say
You know anything about me?
Because I knew about you
But I won't care about you


Now, everyone has come to see
But some things have to die
Flowers out for this graphic haunt
But they all pass me by
But the age is not a funny game
It don't give such a buzz
And when I winced with ignorance
I had to kiss this dust

So, tell me if you want to see
A world outside your window
A world outside your window isn't free
Oh, and tell me if you want to catch
That feeling of redemption
That feeling of redemption don't do much for meEmbed
