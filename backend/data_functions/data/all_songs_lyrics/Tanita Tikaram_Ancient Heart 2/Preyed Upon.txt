Preyed Upon Lyrics
When your life
Has all been token
And your stance
Is akin to breaking hearts
You're weary
I'm not weary
I can take your part

It's eye-open time, sailor
When they want you to pretend
You were inside that playground
I may be old, but not so old
That I can't see
I see your old friends and it's fresh as dew
I see what's new
And it's all the same to you
Now, I'm not choosy, but I'm just half-grown
I took the old man
I gave the old man
I took the old man back home

Safe with us to serenade
To hang around
Your black scarf and black ways
"You have no idea," he said
"No idea what I'll do"
And talking less
It chases home
It chases dreams
But I have really no reason, no goal, and so
If you wanna play real basic
If you wanna help us make it
Don't forget you're alone

Unless it's all alone
Unless it's all alone
You get preyed upon
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yes

I need time
To complicate you
To make you hate the things you might have done
And come out into this morning
It's the sun you want
Not the foreign time
And talking less
It chases home
It chases dreams
But I have really no reason, no goal, and so
If you wanna play real basic
If you wanna help us make it
Don't forget you're alone

Unless it's all alone
Unless it's all alone
You get preyed upon
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yesEmbed
