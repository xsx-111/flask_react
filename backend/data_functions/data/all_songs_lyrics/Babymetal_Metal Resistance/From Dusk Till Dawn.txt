From Dusk Till Dawn LyricsOne only waits
Something's going to come
In one's way
I want to take
Every going-on toward
What to take
Something's going to come
In the air
Pray upward
In the air
In the air
On the border
Don't stop for love
Something's going to come
On the border
Don't stop for love
Something's going to come
Cool
Dream
Forever
A memory
Heart
Gone night
Tomorrow
You wanna mean
Look at my face
More day after day
Then reach it's the same
So each day's so same
I wake from the dream
To keep on dreaming
The night is so sweet
But it's so late
Break
All it's over
Never rule her
All it's over
Never rule her
In the air
In the airEmbed
