THE ONE (English Version) Lyrics
No reason why I can't understand it
Open your mind, we can understand it
Please let me know if you know this is the end of the world
Let me know if you know the truth

Looking for our hope
Looking for our dream
We're gonna find a way to change
This is our song (One for all)
This is our dream (All for one)
Please take us to the land of dreams, yeah

We are the one, together we're the only one
You are the one, forever you're the only one
We are the one, together we're the only one
You are the one, forever you're the only one

I feel it now, the time has come for us
Believe it now, it's time to get ready
Tell me why you know that this is the end of the world
Tell me why you know it's the truth
We stand in a circle pit, side by side
Stand in the circle pit, raise your hands
This is our song (One for all)
This is our dream (All for one)
Please take us to the land of dreams, far away

Lalalala, lalala, lalalalala
We are, oh oh oh
We are the one, together we're the only one
You are the one, forever you're the only one
We are the one, whenever we are on your side
You are the one, remember always on your side

We are the one, together we're the only one
You are the one, forever, ah ah ah ah ah
Lalalala, lalala, lalalalala
Lalalala, lalala, lalalalala
Lalalala, lalala, lalalalala
Lalalala, lalala, lalalalala
Lalalala, lalala, lalalalala
Lalalala, lalala, lalalalala
Lalalala, lalala, lalalalala
Lalalala, lalala, lalalalalaEmbed
