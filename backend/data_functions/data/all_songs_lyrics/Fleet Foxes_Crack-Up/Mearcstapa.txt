Mearcstapa Lyrics

Two lines in the air
Two eyes on the pair
Mearcstapa, on an open sea
But you turn away
No falling today
No wind in the night
You're putting slack in the lines

The eyes of the sea
So easy to meet
Mearcstapa, deaf and blind like me
But the foam doesn't sing
The phone doesn't ring
So what will you find
Mearcstapa of mine?
