- Naiads, Cassadies Lyrics

Who stole the life from you?
Who turned you so against you?
Who was the thief, who shaved your teeth
Accepting just virtue?
Ooh

And did he act alone?
Were any more complicit?
When he would sing, and offer the ring
What older voice said, "kiss it"?
Who?

Who?
Who?
Who?

Fire can't doubt its heat
Water can't doubt its power
You're not adrift
You're not a gift
You know you're not a flower1Embed
