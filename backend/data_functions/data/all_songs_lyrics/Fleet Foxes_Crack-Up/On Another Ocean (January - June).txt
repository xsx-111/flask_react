On Another Ocean (January / June) Lyrics

Biding your time
On the other ocean
Falling into line
In the cold and dim

Wherever you run
You see all you leave behind you
Lies inside anyone you open
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean

Was he not quite
As you had conceived him?
Did the color of the light
Hide the fight in the eyes?

Wherever you run
You see only eyes behind you
Lies inside anyone you open
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean
On the other ocean


So, do
You think the smoke it won't enfold you?
Or there'll be someone waiting for you
Off in the distance, then?
If only anything could change you
If only you knew what you claim to
If only every sign you cling to
If only they were so
Turn any eye into the ivy
And I won't bleed out if I know me
Allajjliiiineeed oh don't deny me
You ended up too strained
Oh I would lead it in the morning
Oh I won't even if I know it
Allliiiiaajjjllliineeed, oh don't deny me
We're in the (eye / I) sometimes...
Too young
Too
Too young
Too
