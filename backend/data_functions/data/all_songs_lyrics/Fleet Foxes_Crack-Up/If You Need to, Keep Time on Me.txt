If You Need to, Keep Time on Me Lyrics

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

Who knows what State is in store?
If they all turn, will you run?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

When I need to, I'll keep time on you

 oceans roar
A frightened fool stokes
 fire
But if you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me

How could it all fall in one day?
Were we too sure of the sun?

If you need to, keep time on me
If you need to, keep time on me4Embed
