I Should See Memphis Lyrics
Endless vacation
Felt like perdition
Sybarite woman
Stood at attention
Pacing the basement
Like Cassius in Rome
Or in Kinshasa
Just let me at him
Like First Manassas
Like Appomattox
I've got my teeth in it
I won't let go
A: (But I gave you no option
Illusion of choosing.)
B: (And if you wouldn't stop them
Then you just hate losing.)
I miss the highway
I should see Memphis
She sees it my way
Her and Osiris
