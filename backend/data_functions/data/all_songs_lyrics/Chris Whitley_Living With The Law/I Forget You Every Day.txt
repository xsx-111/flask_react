I Forget You Every Day LyricsWaiting for to be confessed
On the floor and all undressed
You can tell me go
Tell me I could stay
But I'll forget you either way
Remember when the house come down
And that dirty romance all around
I believe every word you say
But I forget you every day
When I'm laying on top of that woman
Kind of thing, child, could make me crawl
I mean skin and all
Out on the edge of some canyon
Where I just forget and you can't recall
Now you can't recall
Mama cry and Daddy moan
Starving in some trailer home
Want to burn it down
Burn it where you lay
While I forget you every day
While I forget you every dayEmbed
