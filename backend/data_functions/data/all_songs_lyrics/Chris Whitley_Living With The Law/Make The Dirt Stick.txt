Make The Dirt Stick LyricsThere's nothing wrong with staying inside
There's nothing wrong staying home tonight
All week long was a world of restless
Whatever it takes for a little peace and quiet
I got a pump, be right out back now
I got a well up on the hill
All summer long was rain and water
Sometime surrender to God's will
Whatever it takes, you best now surrender
Whatever you know, you gotta tell them quick
Scratching the wall with some old barbed wire
Whatever it takes to make the dirt stick
I hear them coming with the crane and hammer
I hear them digging these holes in the ground
I feel like there's something bound to take me over
Son, do what you can in a mean old town
Whatever it takes, you best now surrender
Whatever you know, you gotta tell them quick
Scratching the wall with some old barbed wire
Whatever it takes to make the dirt stick
I said whatever it takes, you best now surrender
Whatever you know, you gotta tell them quick
Scratching the wall with some old barbed wire
Whatever it takes to make the dirt stickEmbed
