Long Way Around LyricsEvery evening I follow my master
Down to my prayin' ground
No sir, I ain't ready to go no faster
I'm just takin' the long way around
Early spring child, you won't get no younger
When love just brought you down
All last fall I was waitin' for the summer
I was takin' the long way around
Sister, take your time to come to me slowly
Lead me down to the prayin' ground
All that's sacred, woman, all that is holy
Will come on the long way around
Well, right down here where anything can happen
Yes, I'm talkin' 'bout the prayin' ground
Who knows, oh I wanna know what now
I'll be takin' the long way around
Right down here where anything can happen
Down on the prayin' ground
Who knows now, I wanna know what happened
Takin' the long way around
I'll be takin' the long way aroundEmbed
