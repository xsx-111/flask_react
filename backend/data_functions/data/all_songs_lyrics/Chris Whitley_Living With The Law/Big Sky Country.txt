Big Sky Country LyricsNow when this is over
Over and through
And all them changes have come and passed
I want to meet you in the big sky country
I just want to prove, mama, love can last, yeah
Like hallelujah in the big sky country
Just like forever and ever is wide
Be getting over in the big sky country
Be kissing time, kissing time goodbye
And God knows it's all been done, let me tell you why
'Cause you held my number
You held my name
You held my body through the thick and thin
On a bed of roses in the big sky country
Spread out to love you, love you in your second skin
Like hallelujah in the big sky country
Just like forever and ever is wide
Be getting over in the big sky country
Be kissing time, kissing time goodbye
Hallelujah mama, razzle dazzle Problem prophet
Got lights on all over the place
Hallelujah, I mean glory hallelujah
If I only come around once and see your face
So just watch them lovers out on parade
Watch them lovers while they slip and slide
They gonna prove it doing the big sky country
Just going to prove it while the whole world collides, yeah
Like hallelujah in the big sky country
Just like forever and ever is wide
Be getting over in the big sky country
Be kissing time, be kissing time goodbye
Maybe I'll make up in the big sky country
Be just like lovers and love is why
When we hold over to the big sky country
We'll be kissing time
Kissing time goodbyeEmbed
