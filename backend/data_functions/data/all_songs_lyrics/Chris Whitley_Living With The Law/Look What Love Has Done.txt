Look What Love Has Done LyricsWho gonna win the medal?
Who gonna win the glittering prize?
Everybody out here now
No one can disguise, no one can disguise
I woke to you that blessed mornin'
That's when I knew you was the one
Somebody always cryin' somewhere
Look what love has done
Used to be when things got tight
I could bid you a well bye bye
Riding some two-wheeled sex machine
Like I don't have to try
Now I say, my, my, baby
My, how you have grown
I say, look what love has done
Some folks gonna live forever
Some, they won't never cross that line
But everybody out here now
Trying to unwind
We rode out in the open
Lord, I love the way that you run
Somebody always cryin' somewhere
Look what love has done
Look what love has done, love has doneEmbed
