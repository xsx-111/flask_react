Poison Girl LyricsMoonlight over the alley
Baby, where I come from
There's a poison girl, poison girl
Sister do medicine business
Three dollar down for the gun
She's a poison girl, poison girl
I be waiting uptown
While she gone underground for a ride
I be waiting uptown
While she passes some trick on the side
Well, I'm sitting here burning my money
It worth nothing if only to score
With that poison girl, poison girl
There's a place and I know
Anybody can go for their price
There's a place and I know
You be putting your soul up on ice
Well, well, mama said, "Son, what is your hurry?"
Mama did not even know what I have done
For that poison girl, poison girlEmbed
