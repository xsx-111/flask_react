Bordertown LyricsOut on a range in a season too soon
No electric light up in my room
With a dark skin woman, I'm naked and sane
You could learn about the world in an afternoon
But the Bordertown shook my hand
It was the gateway to some other land
I said, ?The Bordertown is the great divide
And just the gateway to some other side?
I got to get across
Now, some folks live in the trailer park, yeah
With the Naugahyde law and the liquor shark
Where the networks and the new machine
They don't even try to make no mark
Yeah, see the Bordertown shook my hand
It was the gateway to some other land
Yeah and now the Bordertown is the great divide
And just the gateway to some other side
I got to get across
When you came 'round I loved you well
When you got paid it was harder to tell
Now I got no grind with cruel gold
I'm just sittin' round wondering what next to sell
Yeah and now the Bordertown shook my hand
It was the gateway to some other land, yeah
And now the Bordertown is the great divide
And just the gateway to some other side
Yeah and now the Bordertown shook my hand
It was the gateway to some other land
Yeah, I got to get acrossEmbed
