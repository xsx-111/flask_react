Shade Of Blue LyricsI've been here before, I know this shade of blue
It's you
I've felt you touch before I know your way
A ghost-like sense of state
You're gone
So it seems you know me, I will wait
For you
I do
I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Slowly I relive a better past
A time I thought I knew
I blew
Now I'm patient, now I know I'll last
I'll last
I've always known my heart's been held by you
I've always known it's true
With you
I don't care if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die
Don't mind if you can take it
I can't take it anymore, I'll die1Embed
