Rise Or Fall LyricsPlease don't suffer, God just make it quick
With all you've had you don't know what it takes to beg
You've lost your cause, lost your time to kill
You won't matter much when they've all got their fill
Mothers teach you to crawl
Fathers teach you to rise or fall
Mothers grieve for us all
Fathers teach you you're on your own
I won't quiver, I won't squirm or sweat
Your heart's not gone but you've got nothing to make a fist
Sooner or later I'll just flip the switch
Forget what you did or you won't know how to face this hell
Mothers teach you to crawl
Fathers teach you to rise or fall
Mothers grieve for us all
Fathers teach you to take it on
All my fears awakening, I've let them back
All this flashed before my eyes I'd never had
Words no consolation, none will suffice
Walk my son I've taught you well, you're on your way down
Fuck the past, I hope it goes well
(You're gonna lie with your curse as you made it)
They're coming fast and you've got nothing left to sell
(You never saw with your cause there's a conscience)
In the end you've got no answers
(You're gonna lie with your curse as you made it)
So much pain here you don't know how to take my hand
(You never saw with your cause there's a conscience)
Mothers teach you to crawl
Fathers teach you to rise or fall
There's no dream for us all
Never seen what you're reaching for
Mothers teach you to crawl
Fathers teach you, you're on your own
Mothers teach you, take what you will
Bang, you're alive1Embed
