Waiting Here LyricsNothing seems to lead me to these words
I need to tell you
Tell you more
Everything's been tainted that I told you
That I told you
Once before
Something hides the meaning
There's no meaning in the words
I've said before
There's no meaning in the things I've told you long before
I've been here
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here
Something leaves me
In these words I tell you
In these words I tell you more
Everything I've said is true
I've told to you
The truth has told you more
These are all I've meant to say
They're all I've meant to tell you
Long before
There's more meaning to things I've told you long before
I've been here
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
There's more meaning to the things I've told you long before
I've been here
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting here to see why I've been
Waiting hereEmbed
