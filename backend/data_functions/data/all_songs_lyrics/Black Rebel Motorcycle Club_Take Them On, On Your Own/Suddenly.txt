Suddenly LyricsI am so high, I can't look back
I'm ready for what comes next
You can't live this life for me
But how can you have control
I can't last till night turns to day
I can't find the words to say
It all stops when kingdom comes
And you can't hide in your grave
Suddenly I was free
But you left me without anything
Suddenly I was free
But you shot me full of everything
Now you're all I need
Blue shadows behind your eyes
I wonder who you disguise
Through windows behind the sky
I wonder who you will find
I'm so tired, I can't get back
I'm walking to still connect
With something I had left
But how can you have control
Suddenly I was free
You left me without anything
Suddenly I was free
But you shot me full of everything
Now you're all I see
Blue shadows behind your eyes
I wonder who you disguise
Through windows beyond the sky
I wonder who you will findEmbed
