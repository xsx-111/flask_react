High/Low LyricsYou wanna walk on my side
But I'm the devil in disguise
That's just the way that it goes
I guess you didn't know
Keep me high
Keep me low
I don't wanna tell you where I've been
You wanna fade under my speed
I'm the one who's in your dreams
It's the sound that you burn
I guess you didn't learn
Keep me high
Keep me low
I don't wanna tell you where I've been
I used to move with my shadow still
Now I'm searching for your will
That's just the way that it goes
I guess you didn't know
But every night that I think of you
With every voice that she brings me
It's not pain that I'm feeling
It's just the hate that I fear, I'm fearing
Keep me high
Keep me low
I don't wanna tell you where I've beenEmbed
