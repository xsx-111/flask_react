In Like The Rose LyricsIn like the rose that grows in your soul
Out of time, now you're out for more
In like the stone that forms in your heart
Out of reach but you can't give up this time
I'm on a wire
To see your star
Shine
In like the sun that falls on us all
Out of time but you can't let go
Into the dark you've stumbled alone
Out of sight, now you can't return this time
I'm on a wire
To see your star
Shine
I'm on a wire
To see your star
I've been blind
I've torn out my eyes, but I fear no more
I've been blind
You've turned from my side, but I felt your voice
In like the cold that grows in your bones
Out of time, now you can't go on
End of the road you've taken alone
Devil's hands will replace the ones I've known
I'm on a wire
To see your star
Shine
I'm on a wire
To see your star
(Please darling)
I'm on a wire
(Hear me darling)
I've taken your silence, but I can't no more
(See darling, you don't owe them nothing)
(Please darling)
I'm on a wire
(Hear me darling)
You fade in the light where I can't follow
(See darling, you don't owe them nothing)
Time keeps this love alive
But your hope is goneEmbed
