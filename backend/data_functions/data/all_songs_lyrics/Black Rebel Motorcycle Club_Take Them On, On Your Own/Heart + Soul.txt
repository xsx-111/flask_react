Heart + Soul LyricsI walk without you, but I need to believe
I've got my own eyes now and I want you to see
There's no discretion in my voice and you need to stand clear
I've been falling out of time, but I want you to hear
And I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
They'll never break you, but you keep it comin'
I've got my own crimes now and I won't let you in
You can't appreciate it and I need to feel whole
I've gotta find a place to hide where I know you won't go
'Cause I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
Now I don't think you care to know
But I gave my life to be your whore
I think our moments come and if you'd feel this love
You could save me
I fear my selfishness will be the end of this
If you don't save me
Save me
I never told you, but I feel you must know
I've buried half my life in the same place you've soared
I couldn't resurrect it, I feel my arms break
I've got a long way left to go and you've shown me no grace
Now I don't think you care to know
But you've taken out my heart and soul
And I don't think you care to doubt it
But I don't mind 'cause I've got time
I'd get down on my knees if I could beg you to see
You could save me
I fear my selfishness will be the end of this
If you don't save me
Save me
Save meEmbed
