Stop LyricsWe don't like you, we just wanna try you
I'm tired of running, the feeling ain't coming
This all could be simpler, it all could be simpler
But all this is sickness, the feeling ain't in this
'Cause we don't know where to stop
We don't know where to stop
I try and I try but I can't get enough
I won't fail you, you won't bleed for me
Have I been sinful, have I been sinful
It's all been for nothing, your good ain't for nothing
It's hard not to die when your time has been killed off
But I have been grateful you know this could take hold
We don't know where to stop
We don't know where to stop
I try and I try but I can't get enough
I won't fail you, you won't bleed for me
Try keep your head up high
Time burns so deep inside you, rips your throat out
We don't like you, we just wanna try you
I'm tired of running, the feeling ain't coming
This all could be different, it all could be different
But all this is sickness, the feeling ain't in this
'Cause we don't know where to stop
We don't know where to stop
I try and I try but I can't get enough
I won't fail you, you won't bleed for meEmbed
