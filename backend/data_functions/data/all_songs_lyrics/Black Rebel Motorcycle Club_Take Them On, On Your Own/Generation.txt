Generation LyricsI don't feel at home in this generation
The ones without a need, they ain't got a reason
I've been feeling alone in this generation
I've had a realization
No one really listens, nothing's really there
I'm choosing sides
I'm keeping up with you and your invasion eyes
You got the world in a coma
You put the knife in our back and no one even cares
I've been feeling alone in this generation
(You're ready to take them on)
I ain't found the need, I ain't found the reason
(You're ready to take them on)
I got nowhere to go in this generation
(You're ready to take it)
I've had a realization
Don't tell me to listen, nothing's ever there
I'm choosing sides
I'm keeping up with you and your invasion eyes
You got the world in a coma
(And the trick bag)
You put the knife in our back and no one even cares
I think I've had enough of this generation
Ain't you had enough
I think I had enough of this generation
(You're ready to take them on)
The ones without a need, they ain't got a reason
(You're ready to take them on)
I don't feel at home in this generation
(You're ready to take it)
I've had a realization
No one really listens, nothing's really there
I'm choosing sides
I'm keeping up with you and your invasion eyes
You got the world in a coma
You put the knife in our back and no one even cares
Ain't you had enough
I've had enough
Don't fuck with meEmbed
