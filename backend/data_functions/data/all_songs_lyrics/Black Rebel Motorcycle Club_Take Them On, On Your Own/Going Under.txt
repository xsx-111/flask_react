Going Under LyricsNobody cares what you look like
And nobody cares what you say
Nobody cares for you god sent gift, girl
You got nothing left to betray
Nobody cares what you're saying
And nobody cares for your soul
Nobody cares where you're going baby
You've got nothing left to hold
Come on
Well, it feels like you're going under
When you're laying right here
Feels like you're going under
When you're laying right here
Yeah, you're laying right here
Nobody cares for your secrets
And nobody cares what you hide
Nobody cares for your shoe size, baby
You've got nothing left to hide
And nobody cares for your rhythm
And nobody cares for your rhymes
Nobody cares where you're going, baby
You've got nothing left and you're mine
Come on
Well, it feels like you're going under
When you're laying right here
Feels like you're going under
When you're laying right here
Yeah, you're laying right here
Nobody cares what you look like
And nobody cares what you say
Nobody cares for you god sent gift, girl
You've got nothing left to betray
And nobody cares for your secrets
Nobody cares what you hide
Nobody cares where you're going, baby
You've got nowhere left and you're mine
Come on
Well, it feels like you're going under
When you're laying right here
Feels like you're going under
When you're laying right here
Yeah, you're laying right
Feels like you're going under
When you're laying right here
Feels like you're going under
When you're laying right here
Yeah, you're laying right here
Come onEmbed
