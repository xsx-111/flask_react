U.S. Government LyricsI spit my faith on the city pavement
To keep a smile
I bought my legs from the U.S. Government
To keep me in line
We are the ones that keep you down
We are the ones that warm the ground
While our arms surround
I filled my head with another replacement
To keep me high
I shot my soul when they wanted to take it
Your worst ain't mine
We are the ones that keep you high
We are the ones that warm the sky
And you're burning bright
She's my river of sunshine, she's my girl
She can save the U.S., save the world
She's alright, I'll be fine
There's no U.S., save your mind
Save your mind
Come on
I'll give you nothing if you're just gonna waste it
But that's alright
I'll give you love if you're wanting the taste that
That leaves you behind
We are the ones that keep you high
We are the ones that burn your pride
And you're burning bright
You're gonna make it
You're gonna suffer
I've been waiting for the sun to come
Lead me throught the gates of Rome
You're gonna know they were never
Never yours to kill
Oh no, they were never
Never yours to kill
I've been waiting for the sun to come
Show you all what's being done
You're gonna know they were never
Never yours to kill
Oh no, they were never
Never yours to kill
You're gonna make it
You're gonna sufferEmbed
