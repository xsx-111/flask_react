All My Friends LyricsThought I might get a rocket ride when I was a child
But it was a lie
That I told myself when I needed something good
At 17, had a better dream
Now I'm 33 and it isn't me
But I'd think of something better if I could
All my friends and lovers leave me behind
And I'm still looking for a girl
One way or another
I'm just hoping to find a way
To put my feet out in the world
Caught some grief from a falling leaf
As she tumbled down to the dirty ground
Said I should have put her back there if I could
Well, everyone needs a better day
And I'm trying to find me a better way
To get from the things I do to the things I should
All my friends and lovers
They leave me alone
To try to have a little fun
But one way or another
I just wish I had known to go out walking in the sun
And find out if you were the one
Does it make you want to come a little closer now?
And did you want to dance with me?
Would you want to hum a little harder now?
Can you see her waiting there?
Can you see her?
Because I'm almost there
Can you see her
Waiting there for someone like me?
All you want is a beauty queen
But not a superstar
But everybody's dream machine
All you want is a place to lay your head
You go to sleep dreaming how you would
Be a different kind if you thought you could
But you come awake the way you are instead
All my friends and lovers
They shine like the sun
I just turn and walk away
One way or another
I'm not coming undone
I'm just waiting for the day
All my friends
All my friends...Embed
