Hanginaround LyricsShe sat right down on the sofa
Says, "Where have you been?"
I've been waiting for you
'Cause last night I had something so good
These days get so long
And I got nothing to do
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long
We spend all day getting sober
Hiding from daylight
Watching TV
We just look a lot better in the blue light
Well, you know I gotta get out
But I'm stuck so tight
Weighed by the chains that keep me...
Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town too long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long
And this girl listens to the band play
She says, "Where have you been?"
I've been lying right here on the floor
Well, I got all this time
To be waiting for what is mine
To be hating what I am
After the light has faded
Hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town so long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way, way
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way too long
I been hangin' around this town on the corner
I been bumming around this old town for way, way
Way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long
Way, way, way, way too long4Embed
