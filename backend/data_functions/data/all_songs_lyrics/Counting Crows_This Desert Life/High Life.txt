High Life LyricsSuch a life
Such a life
Such a life
I'm a comet
And, honestly, I don't know why
All my friends got flowers in their eyes
But I got none this season
All of last year's blooms have gone and died
Time doesn't give a reason
Well hey baby, do you ask yourself sometimes
What you need to be forgiven?
Everything that you've ever done wrong
Is the reason that I'm driven straight to you
Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
How I get my ends and my beginnings mixed up, too
Just the way you do
I thought if I told you
You might want to stay for just another day or two
It's just like answers that come in small packages that go in the mail
Waiting for the trains that just never come
Beginning to believe
In the disappearing nature of the people we have been
We have begun to change
Into the worst kind of people
So unkind
Oh apologies
No apologies
This apology
Doesn't describe the way it feels to feel for you
Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
How I find myself slowly disappearing, too
Just the way you do
I thought if I told you
You might want to help me to remain with you
I just want to stay for a little while
I want to stay for a little while
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on
Because there's a nightlife falling down on me
I just feel like a change
Beneath the sun in the summer
A sea of flowers won't bloom without the rain
But oh, this desert life
This high life
Here at the dying of the day
I wasn't made for this scene
But I was made in this scene
And baby it's just my way
I don't want to go home alone
I wanna come on home to you
Waiting here for you
Wanting to tell you
How I line my sky with all the silver I can use
Just the way you do
I thought if I told you
You might want to stay for just another day or two
Isn't that just like disappearing into the sum of yourself?
And the person you are disappearing into
It's like one plus one equals nothing at all
One plus two equals nothing at all
One plus me equals nothing at all
One plus you equals one plus you
Equals you and you and you and you and
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all2Embed
