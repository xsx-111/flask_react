Slow Marching Band LyricsWould you join a slow marching band?
And take pleasure in your leaving
As the ferry sails and tears are dried
And cows come home at evening
Could you get behind a slow marching band?
And join together in the passing
Of all we shared through yesterdays
In sorrows neverlasting
Take a hand and take a bow
You played for me; that's all for now, oh, and never
Mind the words just hum along and keep on going
Walk on slowly --- don't look behind you
Don't say goodbye, love. I won't remind you
Dream of me as the nights draw cold
Still marking time through Winter
You paid the piper and called the tune
And you marched the band away
Take a hand and take a bow
You played for me; that's all for now, oh, and never
Mind the words just hum along and keep on going
Walk on slowly --- don't look behind you
Don't say goodbye, love. I won't remind youEmbed
