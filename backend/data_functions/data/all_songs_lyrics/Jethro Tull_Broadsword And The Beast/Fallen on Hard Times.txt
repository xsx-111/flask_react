Fallen on Hard Times LyricsFallen on hard times --- but it feels good to know
That milk and honey's just around the bend
Running on bad lines --- we'd better run as we go
Tear up, tear up the overdraft again
Oh, dear Prime Minister --- it's all such a mess
Go right ahead and pull the rotten tooth
Oh, Mr. President --- you've been put to the test
Come clean, for once, and hit us with the truth
Looking for sunshine --- oh but it's black and it's cold
Yet, you say that milk and honey's just round the bend
Giving us a hard time, my friends
Handing us the same line again
Fallen on hard times --- and there's nowhere to hide
Now they've re-possessed the Rolls Royce and the mink
Turning on the peace sign --- and it's back to the wood
Soon there will be raised a holy stink
Somebody wake me. I've been sleeping too long
Oh, I don't have to take this lying down
You can keep your promises. Shove 'em where they belong
Don't ask me to the party --- won't be aroundEmbed
