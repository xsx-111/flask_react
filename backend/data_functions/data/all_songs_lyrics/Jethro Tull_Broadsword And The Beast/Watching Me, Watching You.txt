Watching Me, Watching You LyricsI sit by the cutting on the Beaconsfield line
He's watching me watching the trains go by
And they move so fast --- boy, they really fly
He's still watching me watching the
Trains go by
And the way he stares --- feel like locking my door
And pulling my phone from the wall
His eyes, like lights from a laser, burn
Making my hair stand --- making the goose-bumps crawl
He's watching me watching you watching him
Watching me
I'm watching you watching him watching me
Watching Stares
At the cocktail party with a Bucks Fizz in my hand
I feel him watching me watching the girls go by
And they move so smooth without even trying
He's still watching me watching you watching the
Trains go by
And the crowd thins and he moves up close but he doesn't speak
I have to look the other way
But curiosity gets the better part of me and I peek:
Got two drinks in his hand --- see his lips move ---
What the hell's he trying to say
He's watching me watching you watching him
Watching me
I'm watching you watching him watching me
Watching Stares
He's watching me watching you watching him
Watching me
He's watching me watching you watching
The trains go by
He's watching me watching you watching him
Watching me
He's watching me watching you watching him watching me
He's watching me watching you watching him watching me watching him watchingEmbed
