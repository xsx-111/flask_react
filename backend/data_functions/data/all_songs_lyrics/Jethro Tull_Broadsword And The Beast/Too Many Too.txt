Too Many Too LyricsToo many drivers in too many cars
Too many lost souls drinking in too many bars
Too many heroes stepping on too many toes
Too many yes-men nodding when they really mean no
Too many lives each cat can lose ---
We've got too many too
Too many too
Too much sunshine. Too many drops of rain
Too many equal and average children who will all grow up the same
Too many fireside politicians holding too many views
Too many questions --- but there are answers too few
Too many lives each cat can lose ---
We've got too many too
If I were a liar --- yes, and you were a cheat ---
There would be too many places where we all could meet
Too many temples where we could worship the beast
Where he who thinks he had the most in fact has the least
Too many lives each cat can lose --
I've got too many too
I've got too many tooEmbed
