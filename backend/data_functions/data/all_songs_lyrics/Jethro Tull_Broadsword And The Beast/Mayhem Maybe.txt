Mayhem Maybe LyricsWhen we're working nights, the village 'round
The old church becomes scary town
All curtained windows and bolted doors
But never an eye to see
As us fairy folks sweep from the hill
Never caught us and never will
Pulling roses and daffodil
Mayhem in the high degree
The blacksmith chased us all to ground
They searched all night, we were never found
The tinker boys and the sheriff's men
Shaking the tallest tree
And we sat and watched the women hide
Laughed so much we split our sides
Scattered horses that they would ride
Mayhem in the high degree
We crossed through fields of midnight green
Often heard but seldom seen
Tore along hedges, stripping leaves
No one could quite agree
Whether we came from north or south
We stole the screams from out their mouths
And go where no man would allow
Mayhem in the high degree
Like scaly carp and feathered swan
To nature's world we do belong
We ride the thin winds of the night
And set dark spirits free
We terrify the mare and foal
The fox stood still and far too bold
So we strung him up, brush neatly folded
Mayhem, maybeEmbed
