Jack-A-Lynn LyricsCold aeroplanes, slow boats, warm trains
Remind me of Jack-A-Lynn
Lush hotels and pretty girls
Won't cheer the misty mood I'm in
Silly, sad, I've never had to write this before
Oh, Jack-A-Lynn
Funny how long nights allow
Thoughts of Jack-A-Lynn
When phantoms tread around my bed
To offer restless dreams they bring
And it's just the time and place to find
A sad song to play
For Jack-A-Lynn
Magpies that shriek, old boots that leak
Call me to Jack-A-Lynn
Coal black cats in policeman's hats
Nosing where the mice have been
And the long meow's beginning now
And I'm far, far from home
And Jack-A-Lynn1Embed
