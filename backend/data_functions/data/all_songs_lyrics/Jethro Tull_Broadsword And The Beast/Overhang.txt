Overhang LyricsGood morning, gentlemen
Why the uneasy frowns
Too much everything and I can't recall
Did I let you down?
Nobody will answer me
Makes me feel that I want to die
My mind is inclined to lie
Oh, no, think I did it last night again
Oh, no, been out on the overhang again
My hotel room was a battleground
How did I find my way
My wallet's gone and my jacket's torn
My memory's a hazy grey
Do I seem to remember now
Two creatures about eight feet tall
No safety net to break my fall
Oh, no, must have done it last night again
Oh, no, crawled out on the overhang again
Been out on the overhang
Been out on the overhang
Watching demons and spirits glide
Heading out to the nearest star
Better lead me back to the bar
Oh, no, might do it tonight again
Oh, no, crawled out on the overhang again
Been out on the overhang
Crawling out on the overhang
Been out on the overhang
Been out on the overhangEmbed
