Rhythm in Gold LyricsI have to call you up. Think I've seen a vision of rhythm in gold
No cat could ever move that way. No puss would dare to be so bold
Must tell the boys to follow you
Catch you where you go to ground
A lady of means, I can see. Rhythm in gold is getting to me
What's your name, and where can I find you?
Are you just a rich man's friend
Or was it always in the family?
You seem to throw the challenge down
By the way you didn't even look at me
Put the boys on you. Immobilize your nine-eleven
There's nothing I could do for you that would really matter much anyway
You belong to everyone. Rhythm in gold's the number that you play
Put the boys on you. Sabotage your nine-elevenEmbed
