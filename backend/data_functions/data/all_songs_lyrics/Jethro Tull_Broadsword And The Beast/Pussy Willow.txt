Pussy Willow LyricsIn the half-tone light of a young morning
She sighs and shifts on the pillow
And across her face dancing, the first shadows fly
To kiss the Pussy Willow
In her fairy-tale world she's a lost soul singing
In a sad voice nobody hears
She waits in her castle of make-believe
For her white knight to appear
Pussy Willow down fur-lined avenue
Brushing the sleep from her young woman eyes
Runs for the train, see: eight o'clock's coming
Cutting dreams down to size again
Pussy Willow down fur-lined avenue
Brushing the sleep from her young woman eyes
Runs from the train. Hear her typewriter humming
Cutting dreams down to size again
She longs for the East and a pale dress flowing
An apartment in old Mayfair
Or to fish the Spey, spinning the first run of Spring
Or to die for a cause somewhere
Pussy Willow down fur-lined avenue
Brushing the sleep from her young woman eyes
Runs from the train. Hear her typewriter humming
Cutting dreams down to size again
Pussy Willow, Pussy Willow, Pussy Willow, Pussy Willow2Embed
