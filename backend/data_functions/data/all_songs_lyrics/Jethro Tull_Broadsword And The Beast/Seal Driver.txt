Seal Driver LyricsTake you away for my magic ship
I have two hundred diesel horses thundering loud
Sea birds call your name and the mountain's on fire
As the summer lightning cuts the sky like a hot wire
And you're riding on the swell and your heart is alive
Think I'll make you my seal driver
I'm no great looker, I'm no fast shakes
I'll give you a steady push on a six knot simmering high tide
I can hold us down --- keep our head to the wind
Or let us roll on the broadside, cold spray flying in
And we'll ride in on the swell and our hearts are alive
Let me make you my seal driver
I could captain you if you'd crew for me
Follow white flecked spindrift --- float on a moonkissed sea
Could you fancy me as a pirate bold
Or a longship Viking warrior with the old gods on his side?
Well I'm an inshore man and I'm nobody's hero
But I'll make you tight for a windy night and a dark ride
Let me take you in hand and bring you alive
Going to make you my seal driverEmbed
