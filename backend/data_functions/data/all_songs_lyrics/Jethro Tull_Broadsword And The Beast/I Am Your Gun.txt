I Am Your Gun LyricsBlew my smoke on a sunny day
When the first black powder came my way
Hot lead ball from a muzzle cold ---
To win fair lady and take your gold
I know it hardly seems the time ---
(I am your gun)
To talk of blue steel so sublime
I can understand your point of view
To tell the truth I'd scare me too
Match, wheel and flintlock, they all caught your eye
Pearl-handled ladies' models, scaled down to size
I am the peacemaker, so the theory goes
But I don't choose the company I keep ---
And it shows
I am your gun
Love me, I'm your gun
Maxim and Browning, they helped me along
Stoner, Kalashnikov --- thrilled to my song
Now one of me exists, for each one of you
So how can you blame me for the things that I do?
Now I take second place to the motor car
In the score of killing kept thus far
And just remember, if you don't mind ---
It's not the gun that kills but the man behind
I am your gunEmbed
