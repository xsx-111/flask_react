Flashback Lyrics
"Now hold up man!"
I'm gonna kill him
I'm gonna break his face
I'm gonna crack his skull
I'm gonna kick it all in
I'm gonna break his legs off
I'm gonna rip his head off
And then shit down his neck
And then I'll laugh like a motherfucker
And then I'll laugh like a motherfucker
'Cause I hate her!
And then I'll fall past
I'm gonna flashback
Flashback!
'Cause I hate her!
Pneumatic drill
Right through her chest
Bamboo punji
Right through the wrist
I'm gonna make her suffer
I'm gonna make her suffer
And then watch her die
'Cause I hate her!
And then I'll fall past
I'm gonna flashback
Flashback!
'Cause I hate her!

"Everybody's got to die sometime."
"Hurts real bad inside..."
I'm gonna rip her flesh
I'm gonna piss in her face
I'm gonna rip her open
And then hit her with mace
I'm gonna make her suffer
I'm gonna make her suffer
I'm gonna make her cry
I'm gonna watch her die
'Cause I hate her!
And then I'll fall past
I'm gonna flashback
Flashback
I hate her!
Flashback!
Laugh like a motherfucker!Embed
