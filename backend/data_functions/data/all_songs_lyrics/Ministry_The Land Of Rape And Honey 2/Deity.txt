Deity LyricsEyes open
Empty as halos
He comes for me
He comes for me
He comes for me
Deity

Deity
Help- what's the matter?
Looking for someone?
He comforts me
He comforts me
Deity
Resurrection
Coming in stereo
If you say so
If you say so
He comes for me
Let's pray
To TV divinity
He covets me
He covets me
Deity
Resurrection
Coming in stereo
If you say so
If you say so
Deity
Resurrection
Coming in stereo
If you say so
If you say soEmbed
