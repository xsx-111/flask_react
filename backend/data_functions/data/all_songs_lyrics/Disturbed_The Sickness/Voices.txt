Voices Lyrics
So, are you breathing?
So, are you breathing now, now?
Are you breathing?
So, are you breathing now?

Wake up, are you alive? Will you listen to me?
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say
Wake up, are you alive? Will you listen to me?
I'm gonna talk about some freaky shit now
Someone is gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say!

Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing? You're making me known
Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?

So, what's up? I wonder, why do you listen to me?
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say
What's up? I wonder, why do you listen to me?
I'm gonna make you do some freaky shit now
Insane, you're gonna die when you listen to me
Let the living die, let the living die, say!

Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing? You're making me known
Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?

So!
"Can't you imagine how good
Going through this will make you feel?
I promise, no one will ever know
There will be no chance of you getting caught
They never loved you anyway
So, come on, be a man
And do what you are compelled to do"
Save me, God!

I can hear the voice, but I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be all right
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
And make everything go
I can hear the voice, but I don't wanna listen
Strap me down and tell me I'll be all right
I can feel the subliminal need to be one with the voice
And make everything all right!
Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing? You're making me known
Are you breathing now? Do the wicked see you?
You still breathing?

So, are you breathing?
So, do you breathe now, now?
So, are you breathing?
So, do you breathe now?1Embed
