Stupify Lyrics
Yeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
From the mind of one sick animal who can't tell the difference
And gets stupified

I've been waiting my whole life for just one fuck
And all I needed was just one fuck
How can you say that you don't give a fuck?
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All I wanted was just one fuck
One tiny, little, innocent fuck
And when I feel like I'm shit out of luck
I find myself stupified, coming back again

Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! "It's all the same", you say
Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! I get stupified!
All the people in the left wing, rock
And all the people in the right wing, rock
And all the people in the underground, rock
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All the people in the high-rise, rock
And all the people in the projects, rock
And all gente in the barrio, rock
I find myself stupified, coming back again

Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away

See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! "It's all the same", you say
Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified! I get stupified!

And don't deny me
No, baby now, don't deny me
And darling, don't be afraid

But I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified!

Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, stare in my soul, I begin to stupify!
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face, step in my soul
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
Look in my face! (Step in my soul)
I begin to stupify8Embed
