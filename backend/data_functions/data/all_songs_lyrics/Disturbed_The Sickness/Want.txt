Want Lyrics
She want me, no
Rah-ah! Rah-ah! Rah-ah! Rah-ah!
Rah-ah! Rah-ah! Rah-ah! Rah-ah!
Rah!

Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you say what you want
You howl and wail like a banshee
Still, your mind won't ever let you say
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you say what you want
My little tired devotee
Your mind won't even let you feel

Quivering now, shivering now, withering
Your mind won't let you say that you're
Wondering now, pondering now, hungering
Won't let you say that you're
Questioning, wavering, weakening
Your mind won't let you say that you're
Hearkening, listening, heeding me now
Won't let you say that you want
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Your mind won't ever, never let you have what you want
I feel your hunger to taste me
Still, your mind won't ever let you say
Your kind is just the type that should use me
But your mind won't seem to let you have
The opportunity to abuse me, abuse me
Your mind won't even let you feel

Quivering now, shivering now, withering
Your mind won't let you say that you're
Wondering now, pondering now, hungering
Won't let you say that you're
Questioning, wavering, weakening
Your mind won't let you say that you're
Hearkening, listening, heeding me now
Won't let you say that you want me

Savor the addiction, savor the affliction, savor me
Savor the addiction, savor the affliction now
Savor the addiction, savor the affliction, savor me
Savor the addiction, savor the affliction
Savor the addiction, savor the affliction, savor me
Savor her mind, yeah

Your mind won't let you say that you want me yet
Your mind won't let you say that you want me yet
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Because your mind won't let you say that you want me
Don't want me
Your mind won't let you say that you want me
Don't want me
Mind won't let you say that you want me
Don't want me
Won't let you say that you want me
Don't want me

What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?Embed
