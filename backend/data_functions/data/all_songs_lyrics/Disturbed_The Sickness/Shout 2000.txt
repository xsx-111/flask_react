Shout 2000 Lyrics
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm a-talking to you
So, come on
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (Come get it on, come get it on)

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really, really ought to know
(They just don't know)
Those one-track minds
That took you for a working whore
Kiss them goodbye
You shouldn't have to jump for joy
(Jump, jump, jump, jump)
You shouldn't have to shout for joy

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
They gave you life
And in return, you gave them hell
As cold as ice
(Now, bitch, you're ice, ice, baby)
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to shout the tale

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (Come get it on, come get it on)

Will you never shout?
I feel as though I know you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout?
I feel as though I know you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout?
I feel as though I know you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout?
I feel as though I know you're never gonna let it
And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
(Break, break, break, break, break)
I'd really love to break your heart

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'm a-talking to you
So, come on (Come get it on, come get it on)
I'd really love to shout, shout!
Let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on, I'm a-talking to you
So, come on

Shout!
Shout!
Come on, le-let me shout, shout, let me
Come on, le-let me shout, shout
Shout!
Come on, le-let me shout, shout, let me
Come on, le-let me shout, shout
Shout!Embed
