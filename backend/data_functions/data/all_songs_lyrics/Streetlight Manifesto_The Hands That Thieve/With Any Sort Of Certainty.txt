With Any Sort Of Certainty LyricsYou don't know where the sun goes every night, every night
Or where the moon goes, when it's bright, when it's bright
But I won't mind, as long as it's there in time
Oh, as long as they're there in time
I won't mind, I won't mind, I won't mind
If I go blind, tell me, will you be my eyes?
Oh, tell me, will you be my guide?
If I go blind, if I go blind, if I go blind

Oh my god, I will hold my tongue
And I'll breathe easily
If anyone can say with any sort of certainty that there is something to believe
Did you ever think that we'd be three steps from the ledge
Contemplating awful things and thinking about the end?
Nobody mentioned that the pieces wouldn't fit
You can rearrange them all you want, but the puzzle it was rigged
We swore we'd never stray
Right before we went our separate ways
And now we're looking back
We're second guessing all the choices that we made
No one knows where the soul goes when we die, when we die
Some say to nowhere, some say the sky, to the sky
It's all the same, but surely some will find it strange
But I prefer the mysteries remain
Unexplained, unexplained, unexplained
Oh my god, I will hold my tongue
And I'll breathe easily
If anyone can say with any sort of certainty that there is something to believe
Did you ever think that we'd be three steps from the ledge
Contemplating awful things and thinking about the end?
Nobody mentioned that the pieces wouldn't fit
You can rearrange them all you want, but the puzzle it was rigged
We swore we'd never stray
Right before we went our separate ways
And now we're looking back
We're second guessing all the choices that we made

Who'd have thought we'd fought so long
We started to see our enemies turn into friends, our friends to enemies
And we set somewhere in (the) between
But I heard someone say
They knew that someday
That everything would fall into its place
And everything would be fine
And I really, truly, honestly
Without a doubt want to believe
That everything will be alright
Oh my god, I will hold my tongue
And I'll breathe easily
If anyone can say with any sort of certainty that there is something to believe
Did you ever think that we'd be three steps from the ledge
Contemplating awful things and thinking about the end?
Nobody mentioned that the pieces wouldn't fit
You can rearrange them all you want, but the puzzle it was rigged
We swore we'd never stray
Right before we went our separate ways
And now we're looking back
We're second guessing all the choices that we, the shallow fantasies we, the empty promises we made4Embed
