The Littlest Things LyricsThe first time that it came to me
I was a young boy, little did I not believe
I had a hole in my heart
And I was looking for a piece that fit
The next time I was privy to
The dirty secrets
All the little hidden clues
And when I added it up
I knew a little, but a little won’t do

Can anybody out there tell me something true?
Preferably something that no one can dispute
When everybody’s spilling lifelong secrets
I’m betting safely on the man who will keep his
Despite his weakness
He’ll take his secrets to the grave
And we will leave it all behind
Don’t ever leave the one you love behind
So get your fill while you’re alive
Don’t you ever let them take you alive
And I don’t know where the lies end
And the truth begins
Don’t listen to anyone
Telling you anything is the truth:
It’s all relative
Though I know it’ll never ever come to this
I have a secret. And that secret is:
There was a lie that I told myself
Until it became the truth
But Rest assured, I have a plan B on my mind
If all the webs I weave
Should ever come and unwind
But I’ve got plenty of time

And I still believe in mysteries
And all that lies, in reverie
And though they’ll lay my body in the ground
I plan to never settle down
And I took the medicine
But the pills won’t work
The pills they don’t do anything
But rearrange all the littlest things
And I know a little bit
But that bit won’t do
The bit I know is irrelevant
So I guess this song is irrelevant too5Embed
