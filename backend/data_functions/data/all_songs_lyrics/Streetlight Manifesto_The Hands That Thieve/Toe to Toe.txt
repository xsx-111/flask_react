Toe to Toe LyricsSome day you will grow up and learn to lie
Just like your daddy did when he told you no one ever really dies
I hope that I'm not there when you realize
That those with their nose in the air will never look you in the eye

And you will go toe to toe
Like David and Goliath
Who will be Goliath?
And will you throw the stone?
I don’t know yeah I don’t know
Said the man with all of the answers
If he don’t have the answers
Then How will I ever know?
I knew an old man
With nothing to do but wait
He invited himself
And he still showed up late
When it came to the end of the night he would always overstay
But I never had a reason to complain
Until the day he stopped coming by and I missed his company

And you will go toe to toe
Like David and Goliath
They will be Goliath
And you will throw the stone
I don’t know yeah I don’t know
Said the man with all of the answers
If he don’t have the answers
How will I ever know?
And I don’t care
What you do with the little time everyone gets
As long as you do the math, choose a path that will never hurt anyone else
Although they'll hurt you make damn sure they've heard you;
They will not forget
Someday I will find you and stop on by
And you’ll say "how've you been?" and I’ll say "I’ve been fine"
We will both know that it's a lie
It turns out what I figured out is I was wrong and you were right

And you will go toe to toe
Like David and Goliath
They will be Goliath
And you will throw the stone
I don’t know yeah I don’t know
Said the man with all of the answers
If he don’t have the answers
How will I ever know?7Embed
