If Only For Memories LyricsWhen you were born you were not alone
Nothing was carved into the stone quite yet
But don't forget you heard someone say it won't get better than this
That was the sound of your father
As he held you up to your mother
No one will ever know a love as pure as the one that you felt right then
They held you up
They held you up
And everybody else they fell to the wayside
This is the start; the beginning
A prologue to the yarn that you're spinning
A million synonyms
Will never come close to describe the feeling
Don't ever leave
Cause if you do, dear
I guarantee that you'll regret the day you did
And you'll miss all the simple things
And you'll see everything you ever loved
Start fading til' there's nothing left but dust
And I believe
That every broken bone is meant to be
And when it heals it will be stronger than it was before
And I see
The things that I pretend that I don't see
And I store them in my head, love
If only for memories
So now you're young and you feel alone
Despite friends, family, and all the good things now surrounding you
You can't help thinking: "Oh there's gotta be some more to do"
When all the things that you cherish
Turn in to burdens and there is
No other path to take
You know what you gotta do
But you don't know how
They hold you back
They hold you down
And you kinda' feel bad but you know that you gotta get out
This is your pain your dilemma
Do you stay in the town where they raised ya
Or will you sail away
Pull the anchor and go headed for the come what may
You have to leave
Cause if you don't, dear
You'll never see the things you read about in books
You saw the films and you were hooked
But everything you want won't come to you
You realize now that you've gotta go see this through
And I believe
That every broken bone is meant to be
And when it heals it will be stronger than it was before
And I see
The things that I pretend that I don't see
And and I store them in my head, love
If only for memories
I believe
That every broken bone is meant to be
And when it heals it will be stronger than it was before
And I see
The things that I pretend that I don't see
And and I store them in my head, love
If only for memories2Embed
