They Broke Him Down LyricsDid I mention we were dreaming
When the devil came to town
I was awoken by the screaming
But nobody heard a sound
And the lies we told at breakfast
Won't match the lies we had for lunch
And the lies we serve for dinner, yeah for dinner
They’re the tallest of the bunch
Did you notice he was cold
When he finally lost control, of the ghost
And the epilogue I dreaded
Now seemed likely to console
And I’m still not understanding
The things he did before he left
And the one thing that will haunt me, it will haunt me
Right before his final breath, he said...
And they broke him down, yeah they broke him down
He said “I’ll never be your saint you see, cause I won’t be hanging around”
So they broke him down, yeah they broke him down
So I stood there and I held my breath cause I know that it wouldn’t be long
’til they broke me down
Did I mention we were flailing?
When the angels came around
And they just sat there, they we were waiting
For the first of us to drown
And I started going under
But I didn’t hold my breath
Cause the last thing that I needed
Oh I needed
Was to owe a holy debt
Oh no
And no one holds a grudge dear
Like I do, I see it through
And you may not remember
It was nothing much at the time
But I kept it bottled inside
Oh and we all know how that goes
I'd given up on letting go
So here we are, with nothing left here
And now you’ve left me here
And I was last to know

And they broke him down, yeah they broke him down
So I can’t be your saint you see cause I won’t be hanging around
And they broke him down, yeah they broke him down
So I stood there and I held my breath cause I knew that it wouldn’t be long
Holy smoke!
Some say he’d given up the ghost
But I think he’s in the background (somewhere in the background)
Hiding in his favorite photographs
And he’s leaving as a beggar
Or a millionaire
But the one thing that I’m sure of, I am sure of
Is he found some comfort there

’til they broke me down1Embed
