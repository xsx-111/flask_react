The Three of Us LyricsI will never defend the men who make amends with any enemy’s friends
I will never pretend
There we were, the three of us
The thief, the king and I
Finally, we were forced to see
We were equals in the night
(Starry, starry night)
Looking down between the trees
And the town we knew we had to leave
For what it’s worth
We will walk the Earth until we find the things we seek
And the king said
I believe that I’m a non-believer now
I was a leader, but I had to leave them all
No one will ever know the things I held inside
So I let them go
Oh my god, oh my god, yes, oh my god
I will never defend the men who make amends with any enemy’s friends
I will never pretend
I will never bow down to another man even when everyone’s saying I’ve sinned
I will never repent
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
They will not protect us
(We will fall)
They will not defend us
We’ll be left behind, we’ll be left behind
And I never give a damn about the story’s end
Or even how it all began
And the one word that I’ll seek is one that I can tell myself
And it’s a long and winding road
But if you reap the seeds you sow
You’ll see you’re really not alone
I will never defend the men who make amends with any enemy’s friends
I will never pretend
I will never bow down to another man even when everyone’s sayin’ I’ve sinned
I will never repent

There we were, the three of us
The priest, the tramp, and I
Years ago, we had left to roam
But reunited on that night
(That starry, starry night)
No one had to speak a word
For we all knew what the others learned:
That everything that we ever did
Was but a way to pass the time
And The Priest said:
I believe that I’m a true believer now
I was a sinner, but I came to see the light
The bum and me did not agree, but I must confess some jealousy
Oh my god, oh my god, yes, oh my god

I will never defend the men who make amends with any enemy’s friends
I will never pretend
I will never bow down to another man even when everyone’s sayin’ I’ve sinned
I will never repent6Embed
