The Hands That Thieve LyricsI felt no guilt till I was caught
And I was told that I was guilty
And even then I wasn't really sure (yeah yeah)
That the thing I felt was guilt itself
Or maybe it was something else:
Frustration at the fact that I was ever caught at all
I told a lie that multiplied
And, by the time I'd realized it
I’d given up everything I ever loved (yeah yeah)
Because the thing you lack
When you're looking back
Is the pressure, the fear that you have to act
Yeah, everything is clearer when
You’re looking at the past (oh no)

And I don’t care if I lose
Because my heroes did too
They shouted "court should be adjourned
Because the jury are fools"
And the judge can’t decipher his left from his right
Or his right from his wrong
And we will bite the hand that thieves
We will not turn the other cheek
This is no threat
It is a promise we will keep
So what's the point pretending
When we've seen behind the curtain
And there's nothing much to see
Oh yeah
I felt no pain till I was down
And I was told that I was bleeding
And even then I knew I wasn’t done (yeah yeah)
Because the wounds I get
They will just collect
Ensuring that I won’t forget;
Reminders of the battles
That I've lost and that I’ve won
And I will fight until til I have died
Or until all my enemies are allies
And even then I will sleep with an open eye (yeah yeah)
Cause the night is long and our foes are strong
But I know the road we're traveling on
It only seems so dark
Because we've almost reached the dawn
Oh no

And I don’t care if I lose
Because my heroes did too
They shouted "court should be adjourned
Because the jury are fools"
And the judge can’t decipher his left from his right
Or his right from his wrong
And we will bite the hand that thieves
We will not turn the other cheek
This is no threat
It is a promise we will keep
So what's the point pretending
When we've seen behind the curtain
And there's nothing much to see
Oh yeah
And everyone will claim
That they knew from the beginning
That what they did was wrong
But They still just went on sinning
The sudden rush you feel
When realizing everything you know
Will fade away
It haunts you, dear
But you won’t want to let it go
Someday we'll lose the war
But until then we will dream of winning
I won’t forget
The things you said
When I was down and I was tired of it
The words you spoke
They brought me hope
When it was time to fight
We chose a side
But everyone knew that something didn't feel right
So we stood our ground
And waited for a sign
When it was time to fight
We chose a side
But everyone knew that something didn't feel right
So we stood our ground
And waited for a sign
You said don't look back
(No, no, no, no...)
Don’t look back
(Don’t look back
We won't go back
We’ve come too far
We’re too high off the ground
The wheels have turned
The lessons learned)
You said don't look back
Don’t look back3Embed
