Your Day Will Come LyricsA young lady leaves her mother
With no one to love her
To protect her from the world
And I have seen the monsters
That will haunt her
That will tear her all apart
And at her gravestone
We will remember
Just where we were
When we knew she would go
And I still remember the day that we left her
And that's when she said that she knows
How it goes
And we sang:

Your day will come, your day will come, your day will come
And no matter what they say
It won’t matter if you pray or if you sin
Cause in the end
It’s all the same
A young man becomes a soldier
He isn’t much older
Than a boy and that’s a shame
They will lead him into battle
Hand him medals when he comes home rearranged
And at the say-so
Of a man with a halo
He will obey he will fall into place
Remembered by ribbons but never forgiven
He'll shoulder the bulk of the blame
What a shame
And we'll sing
If I only had a dollar
For every horror
That befalls my fellow man
I'd never work another hour
But I’d grow sour
From the guilt and bitterness
The luck on the draw will
Determine the fallen
And everyone else will relax and move on
But what will you do when
They come looking for you friend?
I hope that you’re brave, and you’re strong
Through it all
