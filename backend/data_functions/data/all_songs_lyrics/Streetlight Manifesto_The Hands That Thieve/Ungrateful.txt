Ungrateful LyricsInside my mind there is a man
He’s always bragging about his plans
He says he’s never gonna leave
(I’m never gonna leave you alone)
Despite your efforts to be free
Your mind and always you will be
A day late, a dollar short, singing
(Woah, woe is me)
And I know I have to but I don’t know how
(Go! Go! Go! Go!)
And I know that he knows I can't do without
(Go! Go! Go! Go!)
And he knows that I need it so bad
Then I realize it’s clear that he knows That in the end:
He’ll never know what hides inside my head
Hey, I don’t want to seem ungrateful
I don’t want to seem like I don’t need anyone’s help
To get me through the rainy days
To push through the haze
So I can get on my feet
And I can stand up and do what it takes
You heard his story now hear mine:
(I live inside a coward’s mind)
Where every dream I dream gets shot down
(All of the time)
If I don’t jump into the fray
(He'll mope around and wastes our days)
He’s like a ton of concrete tied to me
(Tight around my waist)
And you know you have to but you don’t know how
(Go! Go! Go! Go!)
And you know that I know you can't do without
(Go! Go! Go! Go!)
And I know that you need it so bad
Then I realize it’s clear that you know that
In the end, I’ll never know what hides inside your head
I don’t want to seem ungrateful
I don’t want to seem like I don’t need anyone’s help
To get me through the rainy days
To push through the haze
So I can get on my feet
And I can stand up and do what it takes
Hey, I don’t want to seem ungrateful
I don’t want to seem like I don’t need anyone’s help
To get me through the rainy days
To push through the haze
So I can get on my feet
And I can stand up and do what it takes Embed
