The Finished Line LyricsYour life as it finishes
Rung around with wasteful expense
And useless
Conceits
Finds you this day of
Reckoning
Having won nothing at all

And the echo of love and its lost echoing off down the hall
You bend to pray or to bend and say
Something, to The Duke and the killers
Now that this loss has lost you and vouchsafed his gain
Out amidst
The shuffle of a dark, sleek new day
But you are in possession of a deadened, silencing anger
And watch the procession as/ it moves away
From what
Will be
Remembered of you
Which without the curse of the gift that's been given leaves you speechless
And beyond reach
Pointless senseless and now: endless 
A spread of ash in the air of mock concern and mock care(3x)
Just like you were never there 
Pointless senseless and now: endless Embed
