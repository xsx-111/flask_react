Other People LyricsThere are some who  confuse talk of love
With love
Looking not so 
And there's a shiver in here
Oh a shiver

That there's nothing warm in here
He turns and returns and there is a residual tenderness for the man with the ax handle
He turns to you and on you
It's so cold in here
It's so cold in here it seems hot in here
And moves beyond the eventuality
That there's nothing good in here
There are some who will confuse that which is loved with that that loves
And the crawling happens not so carefully
While he turns and returns a cold burn
A cold, cold burn
His stick much more charming than that which he pulls from his quiver
And there's a shiver in here
Oh a shiver
There are some who will confuse that which is loved with that that loves
And the crawling happens not so carefully
And moves beyond the eventuality
That there's nothing good in here
He turns and returns and there is a residual tenderness for the man with the ax handle
He turns to you and on you his stick much more charming than that which he pulls from his quiver
And there's a shiver in here
Oh a shiver
And finally there are some who despite the soft and lush are not confused at all
By the cold in here
It's so cold in here
It's so cold in here it seems hot in here
While he turns and returns a cold burn
A cold, cold burnEmbed
