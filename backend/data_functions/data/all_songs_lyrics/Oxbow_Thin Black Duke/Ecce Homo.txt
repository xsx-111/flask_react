Ecce Homo LyricsWhen all the faces leave us, when you and the gay party leave forever 
There is one that remains, from the gallery forever
There hung on a nail aluminum
Smooth and knife straight
30 stories below, by an ornate gate
Ringed around by steel and concrete and glass
And then another hands
Deep in the universe
And crossed in great edifice
Over the coronation of the lovelessness

Because it shines so
All the time so
Homage to the root
And the cause so
Here it goes
Elbow deep in the larder
The brutal warder
A constant border
And quieting lodgerEmbed
