Letter of Note Lyrics"It is not the artifact
It is the art
And the fact of the matter is
No one does what they did for the money
Leastways that is not why we pay it"
And it is here that the Duke laughs
[Because after so long the money means a lot less to him
Than the songs it sings about them that want it]
Songs of greed, need, and delicious self-sacrificing selves

Except love is really the least of it
The least of every little bit of it
Because shadow here does not lead  existence
Because the shadow here is existence
And the fact of the matter is
No one does what they did for the money anyway

And God smiles on them or at the very least from down here it looks like a smile and he looks like God

Except love is really the least of it
The least of every little bit of it
Because shadow here does not lead  existence
Because the shadow here is existence
When he asks what he knows all the whileEmbed
