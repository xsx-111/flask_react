Cold & Well-Lit Place Lyrics"There's something warm in here"
The Duke brown-shirted and suited says
"And I think I know what it is
Since it smells like a church mouse
So let's rearrange the rec room chairs
Because, jesus christ, it's murder in here."
Shoes shuffle along the linoleum
And she just comes and comes and comes
"Now I didn't bring these drinks for nothing"
The Duke not disheveled or dissembled says
"And not drinking is a sin
That offends the eye of your lonesome
So let's tip the goddamned glass
And get to enjoying ourselves, fast."
Downtown no one without an invitation
Never, ever comes around
"So spread around the cheese fellas"
The Duke clear as a bell says. You might think
"And do what your conscience clears you for
Which, by my lights, is not nearly enough
So let's let the going get tough."
Cigarettes smoke gray and blue rings
And no one here is broke. No, no one here has anything to fear
And while they say that the best things in life are free
Everything around here comes with a feeEmbed
