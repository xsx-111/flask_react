Donna Donna Lyrics
Donna, Donna, why'd you want to do that?
You led me on and lured me off
Then you turned me down flat, da-da, da-da
Donna, Donna, why'd you want to do that?
You tempted me and tortured me
And left me where I was at, da-da, da-da-da
Donna, why'd you want to do that?

Well, when I met you at the dance
You made me think you liked me
I thought that we could find romance
You even told me so
You had that promise in your eye
That made my heart get ready
You built my hopes up to the skies
And then you told me no

Donna, Donna, why'd you want to do that?
You led me on and lured me off
Then you turned me down flat, da-da, da-da
Donna, Donna, why'd you want to do that?
You tempted me and tortured me
And left me where I was at, da-da, da-da-da
Donna, why'd you want to do that?
Well, you really fed me quite a lie
You really snowed me under
I thought that things were workin' fine
From every thing you said
But when that Johnny Boy came by
He really stole my thunder
When he gave you the bloomin' eye
He really cut me dead

Donna, Donna, why'd you want to do that?
You led me on and lured me off
Then you turned me down flat, da-da, da-da
Donna, DonnaEmbed
