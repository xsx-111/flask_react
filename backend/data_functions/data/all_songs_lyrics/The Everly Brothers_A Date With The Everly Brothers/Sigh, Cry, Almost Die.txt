Sigh, Cry, Almost Die LyricsSigh, cry, almost die
I can’t kiss you again
This is the end
You’ve had your fun and now it’s done
I can’t love you again
This is the end
You’ve had your fun and now it’s done
Love is a waste on you
You couldn’t keep it, if you tried
You go on being you
You like to see me sit and
Sigh, cry, almost die
I can’t kiss you again
This is the end
You’ve had your fun and now it’s done
Sigh, cry, almost die
I can’t kiss you again
This is the end
You’ve had your fun and now it’s done
You’ve had your fun and now it’s done
You’ve had your fun and now it’s doneEmbed
