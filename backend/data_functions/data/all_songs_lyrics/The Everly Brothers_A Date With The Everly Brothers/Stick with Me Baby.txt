Stick with Me Baby LyricsEverybody's been a-talking
They said our love wasn't real
That it would soon be over
That's not the way that I feel
But I don't worry, honey
Let them say what they may
Come on and stick with me, baby
We'll find a way
Yes, we'll find a way
Everybody's been a-talking
Yes, the news travels fast
They said the fire would stop burning
That the flame couldn't last
But I don't worry, honey
Let them say what they may
Come on and stick with me, baby
We'll find a way
Yes, we'll find a way
Come on and stick with me, baby
Come on and stick with me, baby
Come on and stick with me, babyEmbed
