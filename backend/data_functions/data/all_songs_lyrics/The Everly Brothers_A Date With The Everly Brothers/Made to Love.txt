Made to Love LyricsMy father looked at me one day
Said "Son, it's plain to see
That you're getting older
And should have a talk with me
You'll soon be going on lots of dates
As to a man you grow
And there's one important thing
Every boy should know:
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
That's why some have eyes of blue
That's why some stand five feet two
Girls, girls, girls were made to love"
"One day soon you'll have a date
And you’ll take her home that night
You'll wonder as you look at her
Would a kiss be right?
The more you look, the more you'll find
Those doubts will fill your head
But think real hard and you might recall
The things your old dad said:
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
Girls, girls, girls were made to love
That's why you watch 'em walk down the street
That's why their kisses taste awfully sweet
Girls, girls, girls were made to love"
Love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love…Embed
