April LyricsDays bathed in red
I saw her standing
By the riverbed
Weeping willow
I should have been more careful
Waxing hope in cruellest April
I thought that we were there
Somehow i'll always love her
Shedding, golden leaved September
I thought that we were there
Dazed, she never smiles
Like she used to
All the while
Weeping willowEmbed
