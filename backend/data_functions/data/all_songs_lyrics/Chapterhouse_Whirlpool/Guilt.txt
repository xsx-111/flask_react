Guilt Lyrics
Silent sin of endless sleeping
Wakes to find your conscience weeping
Shame
Time recalls the distant voices
Ancient memories leave no choice


Tormenting guilt like wreaths of hatred
Different skin of different places
Pain
Feed their sweat and taste their breath
Deceive yourself 'til nothing's left
