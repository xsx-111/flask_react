Pearl Lyrics
Circle of color
Beautiful girl
Daughter of yellow
Mother of pearl
I used to know her
She gave me the time
Then she just left me
I thought she was mine

On my mind, liquid pearl
Coolest blue, fire world
But I can't seem to
Change her mind

Son of a secret
Sacred child
Daughter of yellow
Mother of pearl
She used to love me
I gave her my soul
Those delicate hours
She lost control
On my mind, liquid pearl
Coolest blue, fire world
But I can't seem to
Change her mind

Son of a pearl
Green deep sea
She knows what she means to me
Will her heart ever burn anymore


Burn me out from the inside
Turn me upside down
I've got to satisfy my soul
Satisfy my soulEmbed
