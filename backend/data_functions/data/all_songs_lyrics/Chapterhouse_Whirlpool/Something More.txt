Something More LyricsCrystal light in deep blue eyes
Weren't enough to satisfy
Senses reeling off the floor
But i always wanted something more
You're not alone
Had to tell you how i felt
Had to try with someone else
Breathless nights or burning sun
Waking tears, you weren't the one
You're not alone
Pick me off the floorEmbed
