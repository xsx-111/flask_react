If You Want Me LyricsIf you want me I can follow
I can follow you
And if you need me
To stand by you
I will see it through
Take me softly in your arms
Until we say goodbye
Let me be your guiding light
And never have to question why
River of your dreams
Drift on gently by
Bring me to the water's edge
And bathe me flowing stream
Come with me today
'Cause I'm asking you to stay
Or drift on by
Baby, if you want meEmbed
