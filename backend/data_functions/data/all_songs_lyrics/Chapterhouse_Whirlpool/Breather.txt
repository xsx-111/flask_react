Breather Lyrics
Please me
Make me happy
Breather, sleeper
Make me happy

Misty
Crystal
Blister
Eternal

Soft and liquid in the light
Secret otherworldly sight
Passing time in black and white
If only I could dream tonight
On my own
Teenage lessons set me right
Taught me how to dream tonight

Please me
Make me happy
Breather, sleeper
Make me happy
Misty
Crystal
Blister
Eternal

Love me warm in cold daylight
Soft as skin and safe inside
Smother silky sin so fine
Make believe that you are mine
On my own
Tears and sorrow set me right
Taught me how to dream tonightEmbed
