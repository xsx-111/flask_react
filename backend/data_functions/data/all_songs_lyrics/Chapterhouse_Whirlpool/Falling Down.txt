Falling Down LyricsFalling down
Leads me where I wanna go
Higher now
Leave me I don't wanna know
Falling down, I'm on my own now
Don't tell me it's time to go
Time to reach out to the side
Time to take me for a ride
Suffocate me gently baby
Drown me in your velvet snow
Falling down
Lead me to a sacred low
Higher now
Tell me what I wanna know
Soft and blushing pale in secrets
Breathe on me those words we love
Silent joy I'm thinking of
Take me to a world above
Falling down I'm on my own now
Sinking in a reeling girlEmbed
