13 LyricsWon't you let me walk you home from school
Won't you let me meet you at the pool
Maybe Friday there's a chance
I'll get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you
Won't you tell your dad get off my back
Tell him what we said 'bout "Paint It Black"
Rock and roll is here to stay
Come inside where it's ok
I won't shake you
Won't you tell me what you're thinking of
Would you be an outlaw for my love?
If it's so then let me know
If it's no then I can go
I won't make youEmbed
