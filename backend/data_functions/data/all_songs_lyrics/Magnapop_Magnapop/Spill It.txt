Spill It LyricsI tried making coffee
I would spill it
Raise my head to look around
In the morning
Trucks were beeping
People screamed so loud
I couldn't sleep
And what they'd say
They'd say to me
That I would spill it
And I would spill it
And I would spill it
And I would spill it
When the wind blew
I heard screaming
People screamed so loud
I couldn't sleep
And I would spill it
And I would spill it
I tried making coffee
I would spill it
Raise my head and look around
In the morning
Trucks were beeping
People screamed so loud
I couldn't sleep
And words they said
They'd say to me
That even I will die
So what's the use
And I would spill it
And I would spill it
And I would spill
When the wind blew I heard screaming
People sing so loud I couldn't sleep
And I would spill it
And I would spill itEmbed
