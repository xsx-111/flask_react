Guess LyricsBy surprise the fragile fluids that were seem to disappear behind the eyes
In disguise or how it ought to really ought to be like crystal breaking in a spoon and it's too late
A finger bends another glass of fruit
By surprise I finally see the problems in their eyes or how it ought to be
Really ought to be, behind my eyes a different set of keys, a figure A to B
Are you mean or do you mean goodbye?
Are you clear?
Do you mean goodbye?
Then they say to you (You should do it)
Say it here, say it here
A different time you stayed too soon (You should do it)
Or played before I even know
Say it here, say it here
A candle shows the lack of what I need
To see to be confused, but not to use a better friend than
You're his he finds he stayed too soon (Soon)
Or played before I even knew
I guess it's just of business now
I guess
Are you clear?
Do you mean goodbye (You should do it)
When I say
Say it here
Say it here
Different time you stayed too soon (You should do it)
Or played before I even knew (You should do it)
Are you clear?
Say it hereEmbed
