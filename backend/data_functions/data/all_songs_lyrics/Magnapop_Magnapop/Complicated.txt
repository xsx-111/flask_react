Complicated LyricsThis person plans a story and it's complicated
She has too much to say and still she finds a way
Generally, flips the calendar's pages
Funny how it feels
It's in my mind and it's so real
Like a reel-to-reel and it's so real, then
Why is he so mad?
(Too many figures)
Too many figures
(Not enough lights)
Not enough lights
(Space to space in)
Space to space in
(I've ruined my mind)
I've ruined my mind
It's complicated
(I've ruined my mind)
It's complicated
(I've ruined my mind)
Monotonous times here
Oh, where there should be love
They want too much
A mold, maybe not
Maybe paranoid girls should go home
I've ruined my mind
Honey, without you my life is a drag
And I can't get enough
I can't get enough to fill the pages of
(Too many figures)
Too many figures
(Not enough lights)
Not enough lights
(Space to space in)
Space to space in
I've ruined my mind
(I've ruined my mind)
It's complicated
(I've ruined my mind)
It's complicated
(I've ruined my mind)
It's complicated
(I've ruined my mind)
It's complicatedEmbed
