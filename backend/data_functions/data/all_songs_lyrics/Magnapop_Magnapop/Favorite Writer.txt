Favorite Writer LyricsIn Corsica the engines blew
Your favorite writer died
In a car, in a crash
Died in a fire imagine that
In a car, in a crash
Die in a fire imagine that
Engine, engineer
The fire blew the balls main out
It was likened to a whistle spout
Hitch a ride, hitch a ride
Your favorite writer died
Engine, engineer
Peaceful pioneers who
Hold me
In Corsica the engines blew
Your favorite writer died
In a car, in a crash
Died in a fire imagine that
Engine, engineer (Ah)
Peaceful pioneers who (Ah)
Hold me (Ah)
Well, there I'm one stop short for leaving here (Ah)
Engine, engineer (Ah)
Peaceful pioneers who (Ah)
Hold me (Ah)
Angel, engineer (Ah)
Peaceful pioneers who (Ah)
Hold me (Ah)
Well, there I'm one stop short for leaving here (Ah)
Angel, engineer (Ah)
Peaceful pioneers who (Ah)
Hold me (Ah)Embed
