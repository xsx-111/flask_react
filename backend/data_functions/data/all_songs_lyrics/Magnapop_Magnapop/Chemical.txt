Chemical LyricsPrivilege sent here
Where the ceiling meets the floor
Southern graces
They have come to be adored
It's the chemical (I adore)
It's the chemical (I adore)
It's the chemical
Pretty fences
Your roots have roots
What roots are for
Southern graces
They have come to be ignored
It's the chemical (I adore)
It's the chemical (I adore)
It's the chemical

I can see when you are old
Southern graces
Have roots have roots
What roots are forEmbed
