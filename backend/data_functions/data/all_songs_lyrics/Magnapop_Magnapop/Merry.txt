Merry LyricsBad grace finds the reader's eyes
Keep it slow, keep it light, over by the side
When it gets too dizzy, when it feels too hot
And when it starts to start, it'll never stop
Space and time, creep across the line
And try to slow down the fires
Where the fires hide but it hits the spot
When it gets too hot
And it costs too much, if it costs a lot (Ah)
I see your eyes
Merry
I swear it stops
I swear it does
Bad grace finds the reader's eyes
Keep it slow, give it light, over by the side
But it gets too dizzy when it feels too hot
And when it starts to start it'll never stop
Space and time, creep across the line
And try to slow down the fires
Where the fires hide but it hits the spot
When it gets too hot
And it costs too much, if it costs a lot (Ah)
I see your eyes
Merry
I swear it stops
I swear it
In the mood for living
Living seeming but not real mood
What did you say?
I see your eyes
Merry
I swear it stops
I swear it does
Bad grace finds the reader's eyes
Keep it warm, give it light, over by the side
But it gets too dizzy when it feels too hot
And when it starts to start it'll never stop
Space and time, creep across the line
And try to slow down the fires
Where the fires hide but it hits the spot
When it gets too hot
And it costs too much, if it costs a lot (Ah)
I see your eyes
Merry
I swear it stops
I swear it
In the mood for living
Living seeming but not real mood
What did you say?
I see your eyes
Merry
I swear it stops
I swear it doesEmbed
