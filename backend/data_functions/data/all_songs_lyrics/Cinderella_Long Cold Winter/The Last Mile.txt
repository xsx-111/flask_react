The Last Mile LyricsMe and Billy boy and old lady Jane
We hitched a ride, took a fast movin' train
Got to the top with our heads spinnin' round
You never know just what you got until you're comin' back
Down on the farmland Mississippi shade
The folks down there they told me take it day by day
And walk the last mile
Before I sleep
It'll be a while
Before I get my peace
With the same style
I walked for years
On the last mile
I can rest my fears
I got a long way to go before I reach the light of day
Monkey's on my back I gotta find a better way
Same old story never get just what you want
The more you got the more you want
Sometimes you do and then you don't
I guess I've always been a travelin' man
Cause when I'm movin' I can make a stand
And walk the last mile
Before I sleep
It'll be a while
Before I get my peace
With the same style
I walked for years
On the last mile
I can rest my fears
Don't know where I'm going
But I know where I've been
Look around me everybody's trying to win
The last mile
The last mile
I guess I've always been a travelin' man
Cause when I'm movin' I can make a stand yeah yeah
And walk the last mile
Before I sleep
It'll be a while
Before I get my peace
With the same style
I walked for years
On the last mile
I can rest my fears
The last mile
Before I sleep
It'll be a while
Before I get my peace
With the same style
I walked for years
On the last mile
I can rest my fears
The last mile
Before I sleep
It'll be a while
Before I get my peace
With the same style
I walked for years
On the last mile
I can rest my fears
The last mile
It'll be a whileEmbed
