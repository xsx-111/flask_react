Coming Home LyricsI took a walk down a road
It's the road I was meant to stay
I see the fire in your eyes
But a man's got to make his way
So are you tough enough for my love
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I took a ride in a world
I'll be spinnin' for the rest of my life
I feel your heart beatin' baby
Ooh sometimes it cuts like a knife
So are you tough enough for my love
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Where your love tonight can shine on me
I'm coming home
Where your lovin' arms can set me free
I took a walk down a road
It's the road I was meant to stay
I see the fire in your eyes
But a mans got to make his way
So are you tough enough for my love
Just close your eyes to the heaven above
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Oh yea
I'm on my way
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Here we go
Ooh yea, ooh yea
I'm on my way
Come on baby, Come on
Let your love, shine on me
I'm on my way, Sing along
Shine on, Shine on, Shine on me
I'm on my way, Ahh yea
Shine on me
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my wayEmbed
