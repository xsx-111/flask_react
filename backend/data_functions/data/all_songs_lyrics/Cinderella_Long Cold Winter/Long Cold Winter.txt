Long Cold Winter LyricsI've been down I've been cryin in the dead of night
I've been tryin I've been tryin to find the time to make it right
Gonna be a long cold winter
Long cold winter without your love
I've been walkin I've been freezing
Freezing from a love I left behind
I've been searchin I've been searchin
Can't find my peace of mind, no
Its gonna be a long cold winter
Long cold winter without your love
I've been down ooohh I've been down yeah
Baby baby baby oh I'm freezing I'm freezing I'm freezing I'm cold
So so so cold it's gonna be a long cold winter
Long cold winter without your love yeah
Oh oh ooohhEmbed
