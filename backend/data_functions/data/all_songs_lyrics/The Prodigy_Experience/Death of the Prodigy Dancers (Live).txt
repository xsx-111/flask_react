Death of the Prodigy Dancers (Live) LyricsWell, this is where I kill the dancer
Watch the MC kill the dancer
Death of The Prodigy dancer
Come on, come on
Gonna take you with me
Gonna kill you, gonna rock you, gonna move you
Gonna groove you tonight, come on
Let it rock, let it move, let it move you
Let it use you, let it move you
Let it move you, let it move you
One for the troubles, two for the time, come on
Three for the lyrics, four for the rhyme
Come on now
Let it rock, let it rock
Pump it up, rock it up
Don't stop to the fuckin' core, come on
Maxim Reality is talkin' to you
Let it rock you, let it rock you
Let it move you, let it groove you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
Let it rock you, let it rock you, let it rock you
