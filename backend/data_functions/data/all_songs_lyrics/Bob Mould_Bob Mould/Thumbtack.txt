Thumbtack LyricsHere's the town we live in
This is how the land lays out
I bought a map
So I could fing my way around / way around
Taped the map on the wall
Studied every avenue
I Found my way around
Tried to feel at home for once
We worked out a system
When one of us would leave
A thumbtack stuck showing
Where we were going
All the time time, you wore a hole
The same place tacked over and over
And I never go there, I never go there
But through that hole, you see
My faith in you boring deeper and deeper
Finally through the wall
Map began to rip apart
I watched it fall to the floor
I didn't bother moving my thumbtack any moreEmbed
