Art Crisis LyricsOverhearing conversations turn
Into dust
Critically acclaimed and publicity
Defamed
There's nothing I can say about it
Much less I could do about it
Who cares anyway? Who cares
Anyway?
There's nothing I can do about it
Screw it, I don't care about it
Nothing I can say about it
Hey, it's OK now
Monkeys made of brass fly
Out of your ass
Self-destructive fool fell into the pool
So content with treading water
If it doesn't get much hotter
Tired of everyday's morality plays
There's nothing I can do about it
Screw it, I don't care about it
Nothing I can say about it
Hey, it's OK now
I'm so tired of trying to explain
I'm so bored I hardly stand the strain
Everything you hate
Is everything that you created
Rollercoaster pharmacy of ups and
Downs
Endless ride upon your merry-go-
Round
Stupid is as stupid says
Now it all goes to your head
Inspirations fade / the failing gradeEmbed
