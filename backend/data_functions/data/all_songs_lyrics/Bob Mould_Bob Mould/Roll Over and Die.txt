Roll Over and Die LyricsYou forsake me
No one walks away, not this time
If you can't take this
There's only one way out
It's over and done, this whole thing
Roll over and die tonight
And if I couldn't hold you
I'd end it all
I wish I could have told you why
In this world, I've got no other choice
There is nothing left at all
You don't notice, but that's all right
You don't know what it's like
Some days I can barely rise
But you didn't realize
I close my eyes for youEmbed
