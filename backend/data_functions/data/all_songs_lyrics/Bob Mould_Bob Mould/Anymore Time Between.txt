Anymore Time Between LyricsWhat you say, what you mean
And the space between those words
What you know anymore
I don't think so anymore
What you say, what you mean
And the distance that's between
Those two words anymore
I don't think so anymore
What you say, what you mean
I don't think so anymore
Anymore time between
What you say and what you mean
I need more
To talk to you so bad
So bad I could
Cry again, just like last time
Don't cry any more, I don't mind
It's a waste of time
Don't need anymore time between
Between those words, you and me
Time between you and me anymore
Anymore time between I don't think so any more
Time between what'd you say
I don't think so anymore
I need more you need
More is what you say
Anymore (I'll go away)
Sick of yourself sick of yourself
Sick of being someone else
I'm sick of myself sick of
Everything I am any
Time between you and everything
Time between you and this
Look at me look at me
I'm as useless as can be
No time anymore not tired anymore
Tired of what you see in me
Time between you and me
Time between two words any more
Not anymore not anymore
It's the time between you and me
Not any more not any more
It's the time between you and me
Any moreEmbed
