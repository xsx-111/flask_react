Deep Karma Canyon LyricsYou're in a deep karma canyon
And your world is so low
Even you don't understand it
And you've got nowhere to go
All you see is mountains, counting
All the steps you have to climb
Did you get to the chapter
In the book of childrens' rhymes
Where the happy ever after
Is the ending of all time
I wish I could believe it, I
Guess I would if I was a child
Tell me who will keep score for you
As we play every day inside a
Deep karma canyon
When you mind begins to reconstruct
The sadness into laughter
Maybe you can turn the karma into
Happy ever after
If you find a way to do this, I'd
Appreciate a hand, I'm in a
Deep karma canyonEmbed
