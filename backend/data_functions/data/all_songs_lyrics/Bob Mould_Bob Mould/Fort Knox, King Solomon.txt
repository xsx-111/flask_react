Fort Knox, King Solomon LyricsThere's a place in the mountains that
We could go
We could stock up with diamonds
And bars of gold
If we wanted a fortune, that's where we'd go
And if you wanted to go there, well
Let me know
And inside Fort Knox, King Solomon
Is occupied with providence
Enough, but not too confident
And I get by, goodbye
Every night at 11, they drive the gold
Through the underground entrance
Between the poles
If we wait for a moment, the guards might go
Then I could get the door open and
Grab some gold
But if I should get noticed, don't worry
Grab you stuff and go
I can deal with King Solomon aloneEmbed
