Tonight LyricsOh tonight, oh tonight, oh tonight
I got it really bad
Maybe I'll go out walking, don't feel like staying home
Might take the car up to the hills, and watch the city lights below
Yes tonight, ah tonight, oh tonight
I got it really bad
Maybe I should call her, ah but then she'll know
Just want to drive out into the night, and see where that road goes
Ah tonight, oh tonight, yes tonight
I'm feeling low
Ah the restlessness that's in me, don't do me any good
I know I really should stay home tonight, but I don't think that I could
Not tonight, not tonight, no not tonight
I got it really bad
Not tonight, not tonight, you won't find me tonight
I got it really bad1Embed
