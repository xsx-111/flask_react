Just Like the Rain LyricsI walked in silent, through the snow
Drifting softly to your door
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I feel so strange, I feel so weak
I've walked a world of empty streets
In search alone, I've searched alone
But you're still in my mind, you're still in my mind
And here's where the sound of my tears hit the ground
Just like the rain, just like the rain
When we walked, along the shore
My darkness shaded, all we saw
I was unkind, I was unkind
I feel so strange, I feel so weak
I've walked a world of empty streets
In search alone, I've searched alone
But you're still in my mind, you're still in my mind
And here's where the sound of my tears hit the ground
Just like the rain, just like the rain
But you're still in my mind, you're still in my mind
And here's where the sound of my tears hit the ground
Just like the rain, just like the rain
Just like the rain
Just like the rainEmbed
