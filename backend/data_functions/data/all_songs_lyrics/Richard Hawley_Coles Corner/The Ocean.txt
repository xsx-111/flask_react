The Ocean LyricsYou lead me down, to the ocean
So lead me down, by the ocean
You know it's been a long time
You always leave me tongue tied
And all this times for us
I love you just because
You lead me down, to the ocean
The world is fine, by the ocean
You know this time's for real
It helps the heart to heal
You know it breaks the seal of the talisman that harms
And so you look at me and need
The space that means as much to me
So lead me down, to the ocean
Our world is fine, by the ocean
You know the way it is in life, it's so hard to live up to
So why are you still dressed in your mourning suit
I assume, I assume
You'll lead me down, to the ocean
Don't leave me down, by the ocean
The ocean
Here comes the wave, here comes the wave
Here comes the wave, down by the ocean
The ocean, the ocean, the ocean...Embed
