Hotel Room LyricsTen thirty in this hotel room
You and I locked in the gloom
Lost out of love once again
But I've got you here with me friend
Cos you're here in my arms, here in my arms
Here in my arms, here in arms
Last time I looked it was nine
You know that all things then were fine
Now I've gone and lost it again
But I've got you here with me friend
Cos you're here in my arms, here in my arms
Here in my arms, here in arms
You know that it's like leading a mild life
The clothes in my younger days were so wild
And it's time I met someone like you
And I hope to make certain that it's true
Last time I looked it was late
That's when I started to break
It's a long long way till the end
But I've got you here with me friend
Cos you're here in my arms
Here in my arms
Here in my arms
Here in my arms
Here in my arms
Here in my arms
Here in my arms
Put you here in my arms
Here in my armsEmbed
