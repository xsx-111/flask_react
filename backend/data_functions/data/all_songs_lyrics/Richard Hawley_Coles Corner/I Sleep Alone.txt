I Sleep Alone LyricsThinking, I've been thinking
You've seen me glide along this way before
This way before
Drugged by dawn I sleep alone
Lonely, I've been lonely
And I've asked my speechless shoes just were you are
Just were you are
In search at dawn I sleep alone
Mmmmmmm mmmmm
Deeper, I'm going deeper
Seeping below the darkest thoughts of man
The thoughts of man
Through these thoughts I sleep alone
Through these thoughts I sleep alone
Mmmmmmm mmmmm
Silence, only silence
Can take these words and ring my thoughts to you
These thoughts to you
Through these thoughts I sleep alone
Through these thoughts I sleep alone
Drugged by dawn I sleep alone
Mmmmmm mmmmmmEmbed
