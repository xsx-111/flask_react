I Need You So Bad Lyrics
Oh, I need you so bad
Oh, I need you so bad
Well, when we are together, baby
I have more fun than I've ever had
Well, I've been looking inside
Trying to find someone to call my own
Yes, I've been looking inside
Trying to find someone to call my own
But without your love, pretty baby
I would rather be left alone

I know my luck has been bad
It's been bad so many days
Yes my luck has been bad
It's been bad so many days
Oh, please come to me, baby
Please don't turn my love away


I know my luck has been bad
It's been bad so many days
Yes my luck has been bad
It's been bad so many-
Oh, please come to me, baby
Please don't turn my love away
Well, baby, I need you so
Yes, baby, honey
You know I need you so
Well, look right up
And say you'll take me
So I can live just once more
Well, baby, I need you so
Yes, baby, honey
You know I need you so
Well, look right up
And say you'll take me
So I can live just once moreEmbed
