I Found a New Love Lyrics
Well I found a new love
I won't have to cry no more
Yes I found a new love
I won't have to cry no more
I ain't gonna love you, pretty baby
I don't intend to bow that low
Well you make me so unhappy
But right now I feel so yey
You make me unhappy, baby
But right now I'm not that way
But when you first loved me baby
I never thought that I would feel this way

So now if you hear me baby
Make sure you understand
I found this wonderful woman and you can have yourself a man
'Cause I love my love
She makes me feel so yey
But I really don't mind it
'Cause I like to feel this way
Lord

Baby, I feel so mad
So now if you hear me baby
Make sure you understand
I have this wonderful woman and you can find yourself a man
'Cause I love my love
She makes me feel so yey
But I really don't mind it
'Cause I likes to feel this way
Lord

I won't have to beg you no more baby
I won't beg you no more
Ain't beg you no more, baby
I won't beg you no moreEmbed
