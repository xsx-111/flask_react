Sweet Home Chicago Lyrics
C'mon baby, don't you wanna go
C'mon baby, don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago
C'mon baby, don't you wanna go
Heidy-hey, baby, don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

One and one is two
Six and two is eight
C'mon baby, dont'cha make me late
Heidy-hey, baby, don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

Oh yeah
Hey, yeah

One and one is two
Two and two is four
C'mon baby, don't you wanna go?
Heidy-hey, baby, don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago
C'mon baby, don't you wanna go
C'mon baby, don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

Oh yeah

C'mon baby, don't you wanna go
Come on baby, don't you wanna go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home ChicagoEmbed
