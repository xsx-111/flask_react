I Feel So Good (I Wanna Boogie) Lyrics
 who’s gonna see me
1,2,3,4

In the other day
I was walking down the street
I saw a friend of mine stop right beside me gave him something to eat
Now we got clean up in here
He yelled "Hey Sammie, what's happenin'?"
And I told him

I feel so good
I'm gonna boogie
I'm gonna boogie
‘Til the break of day

I wanna old-folk boogie
Don't know about the boogie
Like me and you, we gonna boogie
We gonna boogie ‘til the break o’ day
Now you know
Last night I was laying down
I heard momma and papa talking
I heard papa tell momma
That her momma got him ‘n’ she told papa
And when mama told papa about something she heard
He said looking hell mama
Don't leave him babe
We gonna boogie
I'm gonna boogie ‘til the break o’ day
Oh, let's bring it one time down
Hit it
I feel so good
I'm gonna boogie
I'm gonna boogie
I'm gonna boogie

I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel so good
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, oh, oh
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
One more now
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
'Cause I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I feel alright
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogie
I wanna boogieEmbed
