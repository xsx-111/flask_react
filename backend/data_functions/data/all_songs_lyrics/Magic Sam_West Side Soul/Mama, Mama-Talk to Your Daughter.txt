Mama, Mama-Talk to Your Daughter Lyrics
Mama mama mama talk to your daughter for me
Mama mama mama talk to your daughter for me
She gonna make me love her but I ain't gonna let her be

Ain’t gonna stand no cheatin' no she won't dog me around
Ain’t gonna stand no cheatin' no she won't dog me around
Before she dog me around she  fix me in the ground

Mama talk to your daughter

She gonna make me love her and I ain't gonna let her be oh yeah

Ain’t gonna stand no cheatin' no she won't dog me around
Ain’t gonna stand no cheatin' no she won't dog me around
Before she dog me around she might’a fix me in the ground

Mama talk to your daughter

She gonna make me love her and I ain't gonna let her be oh yeah
