My Love Will Never Die Lyrics
Well, my love. my love will never die
You've done me wrong for a long, long time
And all that you're doing now I'll never change my mind
But baby, come and love me
Oh please won't you try
My love for you will never die, love

How flowers grow where I lay and rest
And these colored blossoms darling, holding to your breast
And I know that's my love
Bursting out from inside
My love for you will never die

Oh, oh, oh
Will never die
I said my love you will never die
Do you hear me it will never die
It will never die, love
 baby
Oh baby, they said we would never die
Baby, it will never die
LoveEmbed
