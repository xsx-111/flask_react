Every Night and Every Day Lyrics
You don't have to worry
I am your slave
Treat me right & you've got it made

That's how I love you
Ain't it nice to be loved that way
Just say you'll love, lovin', keep lovin' me
Every night & every day

You don't have to beg, borrow or bum
When you need attention I'll give you some

That's how I love you
Ain't it nice to be loved that way
Just say you'll love, lovin', keep lovin' me
Every night, every day


Try me, I'll prove to you
I will do everything, I said I will do
That's how I love you
Ain't it nice to be loved that way
Just say you'll love, lovin, keep lovin me
Every night, every dayEmbed
