All of Your Love Lyrics
All of your love, baby can it be mine?
All of your love, baby can it be mine?
I'll hate to be the one, the one love you left behind

All of your love, baby don't throw it around
All of your love, baby don't throw it around
Love is one thing baby, you won't find on the ground
I said oh no, oh yeah

Oh yeah

All of your love, I've got to have one day
All of your love, I've got to have one day
Don't you leave me, baby, baby, please come back this way
Come on back this way

Oh, baby, I got to have your love
Oh baby, you know I need your love
Early in the morning, you know I need your love
I said late in the evening baby, you know I need your love
In every night, I've got to have your love
Whoa baby, whoa baby, whoa baby
I got to have your love
Love, baby, I've got to have your love
I've got to have your loveEmbed
