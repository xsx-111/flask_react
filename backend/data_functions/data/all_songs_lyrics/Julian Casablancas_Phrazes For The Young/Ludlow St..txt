Ludlow St. LyricsEverything seems to go wrong when I stop drinking
Everything seemed to go my way last night
Everything seems so wrong to me this morning
I know things will be brighter later tonight
On Ludlow St
Chinatown's coming on Ludlow St
Puerto Ricans are runnin' on Ludlow St
Soon, musicians will haunt it on Ludlow St
Where Indians once hunted
And it's hard
Just move along
While I surrendered my ego you fed yours
All my fantasies died when you said yours
I have dangled my pride to forget yours
Will my mind be at ease when you get yours?
We'll find out soon enough
It started back in 1624
The Lenape tribes would soon get forced from their home
Soon we'll all get pushed out as soon as I get sober
I remember why I drank it all away
On Ludlow St
Nauseous regrets are calling me on the phone
My shoes, they seem to be my only home
The only thing to last will be my bones
Oh, tonight you'll hear the animals next door to you moan
On Ludlow St
Faces are changing on Ludlow St
Yuppies invading on Ludlow St
Night life is raging on Ludlow St
History's fading
And it's hard to just move along
While I surrendered my ego, you fed yours
All my fantasies died when you said yours
I have dangled my pride to forget yours
Will my mind be at ease when you get yours?
We'll find out soon enough
While they defended their ego, you fed yours
All their fantasies died when you said yours
They have dangled their pride to forget yours
Will their souls be at ease when you get yours?
We'll find out soon enough
I'll found out soon enough1Embed
