Left & Right in the Dark LyricsI'm running in the parking lot, I'm four years old
I am lost, those were the days
The soft murmur of voices in the other room
Comforting you as you fall asleep
Staring at the mother-daughter clones go by
We're in a race against time, and time might be winning
And it's not gonna take all day long
Watching the urban decay all around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way...oh, somewhere
Feels like I'm going left and right in the dark
How long must we wait, how long must this stay
Oh wake up, wake up
Oh wake up, wake up
Oh wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
I'm ashamed I think maybe sometimes
I might have used tricks to make you like me more
When I found you I was running wild
"Let's get out of here"
Was in trouble there
I want to know, what are you thinking
Cause I think I think it too
Sliding across the Indian wildnerness
Like the wind gliding down soft roads
6am now you're in Hollywood
And you're dancing, we made it
We are turning back the Earth so fast
But it feels a lot slower
And it's not gonna take all day long
Watching the urban decay all around us, oh boy
And I'm on my way...oh, somewhere
Feels like I'm going left and right in the dark
How long will it take, to fix what they break
Oh wake up, wake up
Oh wake up, wake up
Oh wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Your Achilles heel is you like to feel your fingers on the wheel
Some live in a palace, some live in the sewers
The director, the actor, the crew, and the viewers
Boys get their toys and girls got their dolls
And nothing much else changes through the final stages
How you're spending the day is the same as your life
And you're watching the time running away
Oh wait up, wait up
Oh wait up, wait up
Oh wait up, wait up
Wait up, wait up
Oh wake up, wake up
Oh wake up, wake up
Oh wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up7Embed
