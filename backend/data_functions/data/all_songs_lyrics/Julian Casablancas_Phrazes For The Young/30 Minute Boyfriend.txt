30 Minute Boyfriend LyricsI think you're pretty
I think you know that
You got a boyfriend
You just forgot that's all
For five minutes that's all
He's my best friend that's all
Divide and conquer
Train him to be greedy
Why would the person, with the advantage fight fair?
Will you become what other people think of you?
I hope you don't feel lonely when you're spending time with me, your friend
Wish you were here with me
Wish I was there with you
I'm reaching feeling for you
I wanna feel and love with you again and again
We wait for each other
But we are not lovers
I picked a good time to leave
I think it made you mad
You're talking about...
You're talking about what I'm saying
Now
Wish you were here with me
Wish I was there with you
If you wanna talk, I think we should
But me and words don't work so good
Will you become what other people think of you?
I hope you're not too lonely when I'm spending time with my old friend
Oh oh
Yeah
Okay
Subtle indications dribble away which you don't care about
Yeah
Okay
