Glass LyricsI don't believe it
I won't believe in it
I'm not sad
I understand that's how it goes
Take it easy
There's no time to be mad
That's their job
Blood on their teeth
Death on their mind
Pretty baby
Please just get out of the way
Where it's safe
Eyes will follow you
Weapons can't break through
Tears will swallow you
They all can see
Right through
Bulletproof glass
Bulletproof glass
Bulletproof --
You won't have any trouble now
But who knows?
But who knows?
Please don't deceive me
I'm just so easily fooled
But there's some things
They do not want the answers to
Don't wanna bring all that up
But they keep leaving it out
What to do?
We'll just let it be
Until they all need
Bulletproof glass
Bulletproof glass
Bulletproof --
You won't have any trouble now
But who knows?
But who knows?
If you wanna know somebody
Might take a quick look at
Their best friends
Diamonds are hers
A dog is his
You can lie to yourself
But don't lie to me
It's what they want
Dominance and loyalty
Romance and security
Just Stay behind
Bulletproof glass
