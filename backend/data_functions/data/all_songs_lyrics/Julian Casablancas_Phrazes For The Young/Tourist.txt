Tourist LyricsI wish that clouds could hold me up
Like I thought as a child, growing up
I wish I could sound as soothing as the rainfall
But I am only a drop from the storm
Feel like a tourist out in the country
Once this whole world was all countryside
Feel like a tourist in the big city
Soon I will simply evaporate
They took the strings up north
The drums down south
After they crossed Afganistan
A long time ago
You're shuffling your feet
Into the next dimension
Soon skyscrapers will be everywhere
I feel like a tourist lost in the suburbs
Soon our whole world will be urban sprawl
Feel like a lover out on the ocean
Feel like a teardrop streaming off your chin
Some will bet against you
Try even to prevent you
But not many can stop you man
If you got a perfect plan
Can they possibly try
Demand to know why
They would bow to you
In this sand, a thousand generations
Feel like a tourist out in the desert
So hot it feels like the devil's breath
Feel like a tourist out in this swampland
This world is just patches of water and land
Everywhere I go I'm a tourist
But if you stay with me I'll always be at home2Embed
