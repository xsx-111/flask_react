Out of the Blue Lyrics
Somewhere along the way
My hopefulness turned to sadness
Somewhere along the way
My sadness turned to bitterness
Somewhere along the way
My bitterness turned to anger
Somewhere along the way
My anger turned to vengeance
And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserve it
And the ones who deserve it, they'll never understand it
Yes, I know I'm going to hell in a purple basket
'Least I'll be in another world while you're pissing on my casket

How could you be, whoa-oh-ohh
So perfect for me? Oh-oh-ohh
Why can't you ignore, oh-oh-ohh
The things I did before? Oh-oh-ohh

Somewhere along the way
Exacting vengence gave excitement
Somewhere along the way
That excitement turned to pleasure
Somewhere along the way
That pleasure turned to madness
But sooner or later that kind of madness turns into pain
And the ones that I made pay were never the ones who deserved it
Those who helped me along the way, I smacked 'em as I thanked 'em
Yes, I know I'm going to hell in a leather jacket
'Least I'll be in another world while you're pissing on my casket
All that I can do is sing a song of faded glory
And all you got to do is sit there, look pretty, and make 'em horny
Together we'll sing songs and tell exaggerated stories
About the way we feel today and tonight and in the morning...

How could you be, oh-oh-ohh
So perfect for me? Oh-oh-ohh
Why can't you ignore, oh-oh-ohh
The things I did before?
Oh-oh-ohh

And take all your fears
Pretend they're all true
And take all your plans
Pretend they fell through

Now, that's what it's like... oh-oh-ohh
That's what it's like for most people in this world
The rich or the poor, oh-oh-ohh
Muslims or Jews, oh-oh-ohh
When roles are reversed, oh-oh-ohh
Opinions are too...
Ooh-oh-ohh
That's all I'm gonna say now
Right before they come knocking on my door now
No, no, no, no6Embed
