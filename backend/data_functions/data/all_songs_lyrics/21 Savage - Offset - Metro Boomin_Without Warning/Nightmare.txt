Nightmare Lyrics
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm 'gon shoot you
On demand, bags on demand (Whoo)
On demand, bags on demand (Racks, woo)
On demand, bags on demand (Woo, woo)
On demand, bags on demand (Hey)

I need the cash on pronto (Cash)
Nigga, a lottery ticket (Ayy)
I get the bands at the bando
Full of the white like it's Iggy (White, white)
Five milli' in cash, a wide load and we 'bout to get it (We 'bout to get it)
We from the North, I'm just sayin' though
No name on my hitter

Yeah, Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there (Whoo, hey)
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there (You dig?)
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there (Hey)
Come in the middle of night like it's a nightmare (Ha)
You open your eyes, not dreaming, nigga, we right there (Offset, hey)
Open your eyes, real life (Hey)
Ain't no facade (Ain't no facade)
You tryna rob, get penalized (Woo)
You taking your life
Run up a bag, a milli' in cash then cover your body in gems (Bag)
Fucking a thot but I don't go for the plot so I'm fucking this bitch on film (Smash)
Come in the night, you won't see 'em (Woo)
Black gloves, black hoodie and Timbs (Woo)
You don't wanna be him 'cause soon as they see him they shoot off his limbs (Pew, pew)
I know I might shine, animated (Whoo)
A hundreds racks have a nigga waiting (Racks)
You got a Rolex, it outdated (Whoo)
I got your ho outside, be patient (Yeah)
Back of the Maybach, this ain't a 'Rari, this is the latest Mercedes (Yeah)
Spent two-hundred thousand on my whole rider
500K just to play (500)
Open your eyes and your face (Open that)
I got the MAC today (MAC)
Pay or get whacked today (Whack)
Pull up in 'Cats and Wraiths (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare (Uh)
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there (Whoo, hey)
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare (Uh)
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there (Ah, you dig?)
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare (Hey)
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there (Hey)
Come in the middle of night like it's a nightmare (Ha)
You open your eyes, not dreaming, nigga, we right there
