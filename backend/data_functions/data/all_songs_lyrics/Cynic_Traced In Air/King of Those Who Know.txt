King of Those Who Know LyricsKing of Those Who Know
Into the pure abodes
From the mountain top
He looks upon the crowds
Mindful among the mindless
Unbound
King of Those Who Know
I'm sheltering the fears
The loneliness exposed
An ocean born of tears
For the world
The churchyard bells
Ring mine for just today
Save me from hope
That I'll be saved
King of Those Who Know
My thirsts unquenchable
The rain could become gold
And share my box of bones
In the ground
We raise the vibratory level so high
That all untruth will fall
Of itâ€™s own dead weight
King of Those Who Know
I've taken off my clothes
The diamond crushed the stone
And gave the world a heart
Our karma is all been burned
The molecules emerge
In a world beyond this world
We dare (dare)
We dare (dare)
Speak the word
We dare (dare)
We dare (dare)
Speak the word
We dare (dare)
We dare (dare)
