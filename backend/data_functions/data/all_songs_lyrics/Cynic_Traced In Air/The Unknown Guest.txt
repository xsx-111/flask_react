The Unknown Guest LyricsMemory, thunder cloud
Sadi, Sati, killing down
Starved at the root again
We don't taste the air
Mother tongue
Om shrim maha
Lakshmiyei swama om
Vibrate (inner) universe
Primal state (counsels)
To the unknown guest
Penniless, in reverse
A pathless land
Where we touch Earth
Dark at the bloom again
We don't see the dawn
Mother tongue
Om shrim maha
Lakshmiyei swama om
Vibrate (inner) universe
Primal state (counsels)
To the unknown guest
Pulsate
Starved at the root again
We don't taste the air
Dark at the bloom again
We hold our despair
Mama tongue
Om shrim maha
Lakshmiyei swama om
Om shrim maha
Lakshmiyei swama om
Om shrim maha
Lakshmiyei swama om
Om shrim maha
Lakshmiyei swama om
Om shrim maha
Lakshmiyei swama om
Vibrate (inner) universe
Timeless state (counsels)
To the unknown guest
Pulsate (silent) universe
Mantra's grace
