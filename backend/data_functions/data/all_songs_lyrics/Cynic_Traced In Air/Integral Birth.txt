Integral Birth LyricsI touch the string though the harp may not sing
Still I dig the sky for sun sparks to guide
Down below theres a land with an ominous hole
Dug deep in the sand of belief
A million doves
Orbit round the earth with tears of blood
Dare the virgin take integral birth
From the void I am born into wave and particle
In the uncreated light emerged an oracle
A million doves
Orbit round the earth with tears of blood
Slay the dragon take integral birth
Weep no more
Noble silence usher my way home
A million doves
Orbit round the earth with tears that flood
Line in sand erased we are but one
Cosmic cavalcade we are but one
Time has come I take integral birth
