Noble Surfer Lyrics
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

The surfers call him "Noble"
And that's just what he is
He's dedicated to the mighty sea
Surfing night and day
Never twice in one spot
He's something you and I would like to be

Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

He's not afraid of body whop
From ten feet or more
He never backs away from a swell
Hurachis on his feet
Bushy hair on his head
And where he's going he'd never tell
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)

A surfing Cassanova
With his customized board
A Woody and his dirty white jeans
He takes his choice of honeys
Up and down the coast
The finest surfer yet to make the scene

Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)
Noble (he's moving)
Noble (ain't joshing)
Surfer (ain't joshing)
He's the number one man (he's moving)Embed
