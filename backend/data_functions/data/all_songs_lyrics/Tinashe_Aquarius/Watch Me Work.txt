Watch Me Work Lyrics
I believe you'll be somebody
Someone I can call the one
You gon' be my only, only
I can see that you were watchin'
I'mma make you fall in love
Just step back and watch me work, work, work daddy
Watch me while I work, work work
Yeah, let me do my work, work, work daddy
Watch me while I work, work work daddy

Tell me that you want it
I've been waitin' on it
You a real ass nigga
Baby come and get it
Yeah baby come get it
You know I've been waiting
Wanna feel it while I feel it
You know you're takin' too long

Uh oh, bottles low, before you know
Uh oh, good to go, uh oh
Uh oh, I'm ready now, I'm on the floor
Uh oh, uh oh
(Ooh I'm ready, now I'm ready)
I believe you'll be somebody
Someone I can call the one
You gon' be my only, only
I can see that you were watchin'
I'mma make you fall in love
Just step back and watch me work, work, work daddy
Watch me while I work, work work
Yeah, now let me do my work, work, work daddy
Watch me while I work, work work daddy

Tell me that you need it
Only if you mean it
You a real ass nigga
Baby fuck with it
Yeah baby fuck with it
You know I've been waitin'
If you sleepin' then you're sippin'
You know you're taking too long

Uh oh, bottles low, before you know
Uh oh, good to go, uh oh
Uh oh, I'm ready now, I'm on the floor
Uh oh, uh oh
(Ooh I'm ready, now I'm ready)
I believe you'll be somebody
Someone I can call the one
You gon' be my only, only
I can see that you were watchin'
I'mma make you fall in love
Just step back and watch me work, work, work daddy
Watch me while I work, work work
Yeah, now let me do my work, work, work daddy
Watch me while I work, work work daddy

The night is young
Baby, baby
Where we headed right now?
If you're really down
Ready, ready
I can make your whole life worthwhile

I believe you'll be somebody
Someone I can call the one
You gon' be my only, only
I can see that you were watchin'
I'mma make you fall in love
Just step back and watch me work, work, work daddy
Watch me while I work, work work
Yeah, now let me do my work, work, work daddy
Watch me while I work, work work daddy5Embed
