Thug Cry Lyrics
Mike WiLL Made It

Let me be the one to put your love on speed
Let me feng shui your shit
It tastes way better when you don't think you need it, oh
Bet you ain't never felt 3 AM feel like this like this, no
Like the moon's colliding, diamonds, baby can we soar

There's something 'bout you
Baby we got to
Give it all that we got for the moment

I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby
I can make a thug cry, tonight
(I can make you cry tonight, tonight)
I can make a thug cry, tonight

Let me turn your pain into a kiss, yeah
Baby I can handle it
Baby won't you sip on this here?
Go on and relax, we can lay back
On the moon's colliding, diamonds, baby can we soar
There's something 'bout you
Baby we got to
Give it all that we got for the moment

I can make a thug cry, tonight
Watch me make a thug cry, tonight
Cause that's how true love is supposed to be, ain't it?
When it feels so good it shakes all your belief, baby
I can make a thug cry, tonight
(I can make you cry tonight, tonight)
I can make a thug cry, tonight

You think you a gangsta
But don't even play
Cause at the end of the day
You love when I call you my bae
Ain't that right?
You're all mine
You acting so gangsta
You swear that ya hard
But I got you wrapped around my finger
Yeah you be thanking the lord
You're all mine
Ain't that right
There's something about you
Baby we got to get lost in the moment
You and me only
Thug cry, tonight
Can you hear the thug cry tonight
Oh-oh-oh, tonight3Embed
