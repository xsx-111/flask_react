Bet Lyrics
Sky's on fire
Lightning, the storm's come
You know I, tried to tell you
Attempted to warn you
And we've been praying for the rain
It's been months now
Since you came here to California
I'll be here to hold ya

Bet on it
Bet on it
Pay no mind to what the doubters all say
I'mma be around for ever, always
You can bet on it

Sky's on, fire
Lightning, the storm's come
You know I, tried to tell you
Attempted to warn you
And we've been praying, anticipating
Been a long time coming for the road that we had to follow
I'll be here tomorrow
Bet on it
Bet on it
Pay no mind to what the doubters all say
I'mma be around for ever, always
You can bet on it

Fire
Yeah whisper in the wind
Slippin' on the back of your neck
Something 'bout to happen here
And you're gonna wanna witness it for sure
When you're sick of all the rest
Comparisons will only set to be besides your call
Nothing more, nothing less
Ain't no stopping what is written by the cosmic call
