Wildfire Lyrics
Feel the calm before the storm
I'll be leaving in the morning
You were my sweet summer song
But the summer's gone and I can't keep your fire burning

You're poison running through my veins
End it with a spark into a pool of gasoline

Wildfire
Flames rising
Hit me like a bullet
Finger on the trigger, pull it, pull it
Wildfire, burn baby
Burn for me

Castles crash into the sand
As they're swept into the sea
I could never understand
How you're easy come easy go
As you please

You're poison running through my veins
End it with a spark into a pool of gasoline
Wildfire
Flames rising
Hit me like a bullet
Finger on the trigger, pull it, pull it
Wildfire, burn baby
Burn for me
Wildfire
Wildfire, wildfire
Wildfire, burn baby
Burn for me

Let me go let me go
Let me go let me go
Let me go let me go
Let me go let me go

Wildfire
Flames rising
Hit me like a bullet
Finger on the trigger, pull it, pull it
Wildfire, burn baby
Burn for me
Wildfire
Wildfire, wildfire
Wildfire, burn baby16Embed
