Bated Breath Lyrics
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

What if I told you that it was all in vain?
Would it still hurt you?
Would you still feel the same?
Said its impossible, possible
So impossible

But you're still waiting on the moment
Breath is bated
I wish I could hold you, I can't take it
Tell you all my secrets
I'm too faded
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Maybe I can tell you, maybe we can do this
Kisses on my forehead, we can fall into it
Love you like the rain, it falls much faster
Living in a piece of ever after
Forever after
Living in the piece of ever after
Ever after, ever after

If you will have me
I'll make you happy
Need someone to whom I can belong
Here's my confession
Saving it special
Hoped it would be you all along
All along
All along
All along
But you're still waiting on the moment
Breath is bated
I wish I could hold you, I can't take it
Tell you all my secrets
I'm too faded
Praying that tomorrow I'll be braver
Maybe I can tell you, maybe we can do this
Kisses on my forehead, we can fall into it
Love you like the rain, it falls much faster
Living in a piece of ever after
Forever after
Living in the piece of ever after
Ever after, ever after19Embed
