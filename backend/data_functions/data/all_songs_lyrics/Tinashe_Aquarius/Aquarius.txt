Aquarius Lyrics
Simmer down, know youâ€™re angry
I can make, make it okay
I can tell, I'ma be your baby
Feel your stress melting away somehow
These hoes you know won't hold you down
Getting so hard to see the lights

Lights, lights low, low, low
Grind, grind, grind slow, slow
Mind, mind, mind numb, numb, numb
I'll, I'll, I've come, come

Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

I remember being back in the woods
Everything is gonna change

In a world full of darkness
I've become your midnight sun
Wanna change, the first step is the hardest
A brand new age has finally begun right now
This life right here won't hold me down
Getting so hard to see the stars
Stars, stars are aligned, aligned
The government, the media, want us blind, blind
And my mind, mind, mind numb, numb, numb
The time's, time's, time's come, come

Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

The age of Aquarius
The dawn of a new era

Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

(Aquarius, Aquarius, Aquarius)
