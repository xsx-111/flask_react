Cold Sweat Lyrics
I like bein' alone
Come around here, spend plenty of time on your own
Cause the city ain't kind
On the people who sign up for judgin' but can't take no
Complacent
This ain't a place to be makin' friends, they all got agendas
These eyes on your back, fangs in your neck
Thinkin' of venom (venom), fienin' for a taste of this shit
Seem so thirsty, smell fresh meat in the air (blood on the floor)
So the real test, after breakfast
We'll see who will still be here

This pressure ain't for everybody
Weighing so heavy on my body, body (yeah)

Spine shivers, eyes met
Head in it, heart set (yeah)
Gold on my mind, yeah
Ice, drippin', cold sweat
Ice-Ice drippin', cold sweat
Ice drippin', cold sweat
Ice drippin', cold sweat
Ice drippin', cold sweat
Can't choose the situational friend
Always quick to co-sign, everything's a ten
Damn I hate a yes man
I know all this buzzin' gotta be ringin' in your ear
But don't think I've forgotten who was always here
Tell me, where was you last year?
And I doubt you will last here
It's your last here

This pressure ain't for everybody (no no no no no pressure)
Weighing so heavy on my body, body (yeah)

Spine shivers, eyes met
Head in it, heart set (yeah)
Gold on my mind, yeah
Ice, drippin', cold sweat
Ice-Ice drippin', cold sweat
Ice drippin', cold sweat
Ice drippin', cold sweat
Ice drippin', cold sweat
(No no no no no nah nah nah nah)
(Ice drippin')
Wish I always got my way
Time for me to accept defeat when my hands are tied
Like to dine in the lights with you tonight
Don't trip, everything will end up just fine
These summers they ain't the same
These lovers they ain't the game
These feelings, they don't mean nothing
These ceilings can't keep the pain
Explanations, you say I deserve it
Why after all this time I'm finally worth it?
Ain't it funny, how power comes with money
And how now I'm out here poppin'
They come back like they're an option
Man this shit is hella scummy
They claimin' that they love me
Cause they realize that my time is finally comin'
They know it
Cause my night is young, moon is high
And the stars are all aligned42Embed
