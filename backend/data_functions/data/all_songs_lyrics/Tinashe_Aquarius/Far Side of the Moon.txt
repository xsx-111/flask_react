Far Side of the Moon Lyrics
Out of balance, out of options
I've been tryin' for hours to weigh the possibilities
For you and me
What it'd really take to truly be happy
Sick of wishin', holdin' on to empty love ambitions
Happily ever after seems like fiction
I'd be foolish if my faith ain't slipping, sadly

(Get away from me)
Wish that I could hurt less
(Ain't got time for your nonsense)
(Don't wanna hear you speak)
Seeing you makes me nervous
'Cause I really believe we still deserve it
And maybe, just maybe I was mistaken
Maybe we could be perfect
Maybe I was mistaken
Maybe its really worth it
I'm not sure yet

Runnin' from my heart
Hate to go so soon
This has to be the end
You won't see me again
The far side of the moon
Runnin' from my heart
So damn jaded
This uncertainty is so frustratin'
I be up here mindin' like I'm waitin'
I'm too old for all these games we playin'
I'm just sayin', uh
You really think that you're the man?
You out here runnin' shit
You know you can
But I ain't like these other women
No I, I ain't really fuckin' with it

(Get away from me)
Wish that I could hurt less
(Ain't got time for your nonsense)
(Don't wanna hear you speak)
Seeing you makes me nervous
'Cause I really believe we still deserve it
And maybe just maybe I was mistaken
Maybe we could be perfect
Maybe I was mistaken
Maybe its really worth it
But until then

Runnin' from my heart
Hate to go so soon (hate to go)
This has to be the end (the end)
You won't see me again (oh)
The far side of the moon
Runnin' from my heart
I'm giving you my last goodbye
Ooh, I'm movin' on
You can do no wrong
Ooh, but I'll be long gone

Runnin' from my heart
Hate to go so soon
This has to be the end
You won't see me again
The far side of the moon
Runnin' from my heart7Embed
