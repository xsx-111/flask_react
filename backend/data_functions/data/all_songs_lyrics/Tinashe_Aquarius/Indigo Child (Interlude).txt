Indigo Child (Interlude) Lyrics
I can feel your heart stop
I can see the future
I can change the old world
I'll rewrite the scripture
I'm a beacon of light
In the dark of winter
I'll erase the old ways
Like a new beginner

I can see the future
I'll rewrite the scripture
I'll come out a winner

Indigo Child, this is the time now
Ooh, I can read your mind
Facing the world
Running in circles
(Mmm, everyone is running in circles)
Indigo Child, this ain't losing your mind now
But they don't understand
Don't let it get to your head
And you feel it
(Ooh-ooh-oh)
[I can feel your heart stop
I can see the future
I can change the old world
I'll rewrite the scripture
I'm a beacon of light
In the dark of winter
I'll erase the old ways
Like a new beginner](4936328)

I can feel your heart stop
I can see the future
I can change the old world
I'll rewrite the scripture
I'm a beacon of light
In the dark of winter
In the race against time
I'll come out a winner8Embed
