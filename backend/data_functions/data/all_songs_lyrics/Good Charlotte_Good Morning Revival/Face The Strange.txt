Face The Strange Lyrics
Save me
Lately I've been feeling low
I've been feeling alone the things I used to be
I miss the things I used to see
I need something again
My oldest friends these cigarettes can't cure
It just ain't what I'm looking for

We all need a little change
I guess it's time to face the strange
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't get my mind right
I need, I need, I need, I need something to get me right

Where is my future it used to be in front of me
Misery's my company
Living in what used to be
Another right, another clean now that I've surrendered
It seems that all I wants to be back where I started from


I think it's time to use this company I keep
The company I keep don't keep me company?
And all my dreams are right out there in front of me
It's sounding like the deepest darkest part of me
And all I really wanted was to make a change
I never thought they'd keep me locked up in these chains
I never thought my life would end up this strange
