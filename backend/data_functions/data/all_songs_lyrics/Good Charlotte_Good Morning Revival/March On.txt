March On Lyrics
Don't cry, open up your eyes and know
There's someone else out there that feels this way
I'm singing to you, 'Cause I know what you've been through and
Now, it's not so long ago I felt the same

Like soldiers, march on, if we can make it through tonight
We'll see the sun, march on, march on

And I remember summer nights alone, the fireflies the only thing
We own, yeah, all we had were dreams of California
And I remember winters were so cold, hunger was the only thing
We know, and rock 'n' roll dreaming was what saved us

Like soldiers, march on, if we can make it through tonight
We'll see the sun, march on, march on

Till we see the sun, march on, till we see the sun
Through the good times, through the bad times
Through the long days, through the hard nights
Keep on, till we see the sun
Like soldiers, march on, if we can make it through tonight
We'll see the sun, march on, march on
Like soldiers, march on, if we can make it through tonight
We'll see the sun, march on, march on

Even when there's no one there for you, march on
Even when the days are long for you, march on
And like soldiers, march on...Embed
