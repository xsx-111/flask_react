Keep Your Hands Off My Girl Lyrics
Let the record play
Let the record play
Let the record play

The way that you dance, the way that you move
The way that you stare at me across the room
You carry Dior bags, and you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
I got a model 26, but she stays in her place
I got a Kershaw neatly, tucked inside in my waist

And the record keeps playing the same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
But the record keeps playing the same old song
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

Now she sweating my friends and my hurricane shoes
She likes the records I spin, my Adam Barton tattoos
But she can't say "What's up?" So what does she do?
She just stays posted up the other side of the room, I got AMC
Tattooed on my hand, I got Black Wall Street on a black bandana
And the record keeps playing the same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
But the record keeps playing the same old song
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl

She, she, she don't want to talk about it
He, he, he wants to fight about
Me, me, I don't want to fight about it
I just want to be up out it, I'm just trying to stay up out it
Step out the wagon, you know the boy starts to hate, the girl that
Came with him, they like that's not the boy she dates, they get to
Fighting and swearing and now the boyfriend is staring
The disco ball on the ceiling looks like the chain that I'm wearing

But the music keeps playing
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain

And the record keeps playing the same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
And the record keeps playing the same old song
The hipster mean mugging on me all night long
They say "Ah ha, ah ha"
Keep your hands off my girl, keep your hands off my girl
You carry Dior bags, and you got your Chanel
You wear Louis Vuitton, HG, and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck in my chain2Embed
