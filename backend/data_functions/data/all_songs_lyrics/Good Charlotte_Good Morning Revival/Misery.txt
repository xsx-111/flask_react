Misery Lyrics
Take a look around, don't you see it?
See that you are the only real face in the room
No one here has a clue what you're feeling
Don't feel bad, keep your sadness alive

Look at all these happy people, living their lives
Look at all these plastic people, there's nothing inside
Look at all these shallow people, telling their lies
Look at all these empty people, people

Don't you know that misery loves company
Yeah, I heard that misery was looking for me
Happiness is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah, I heard that misery comes looking for me

Whoa, misery's my company
Whoa, misery is looking for me, looking for me

The hands are up now, everybody's singing
Everybody's moving, they've programmed their feelings
They're synchronizing and criticizing
Don't feel bad, keep your sadness alive
Look at all these happy people, living their lives
Look at all these plastic people, they're dying inside
Look at all these shallow people, telling their lies
Look at all these empty people, people

Don't you know that misery loves company
Yeah, I heard that misery was looking for me
Happiness is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah, I heard that misery comes looking for me

Whoa, misery's my company
Whoa, misery is looking for me

Don't you know this misery loves me
Don't you know this misery loves me
Don't you know this misery loves me
Don't you know this misery loves me, loves me


So you're tired of running, you're tired of hurting
You're tired of living in their lie
You're tired of listening, you're tired of hurting
Keep your sadness alive, alive, alive
Don't you know that misery loves company
Yeah, I heard that misery was looking for me
Happiness is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah, I heard that misery comes looking for me
Don't you know? Misery loves company
Yeah, I heard that misery was looking for me
Happiness is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah, I heard that misery comes looking for me

Whoa, misery's my company
Whoa, misery is looking for meEmbed
