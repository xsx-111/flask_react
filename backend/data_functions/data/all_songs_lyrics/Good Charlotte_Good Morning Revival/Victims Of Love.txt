Victims Of Love Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
In the beginning, I tried to warn you
You play with fire, it's going to burn you
And here we are now, the same situation
You never listen, I never listen

Now I am thinking of a way that I can make an escape
It's got me caught up in a web and my heart's the prey
Do you really want to throw your heart away, away, away?

Everybody's hurt somebody before
Everybody's been wound by somebody before
You can change but you'll always come back for more
It's a game and we are all just victims of love

Don't try to fight it, victims of love
You can't decide it, victims of love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, victims of love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Now you've back tracked
You're running away 'cause it just happened again and you just want it to end
Trying your best to not let yourself go cold, so cold
Now you think about the things you thought you wanted to say
But when you open up your mouth it don't come out that way
Are you really going to throw your heart away, away, away?

Everybody's hurt somebody before
Everybody's been wound by somebody before
You can change but you'll always come back for more
It's a game and we are all just victims of love

Don't try to fight it, victims of love
You can't decide it, victims of love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, victims of love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, victims of love

In the beginning, I tried to warn you
You play with fire, it's going to burn you
And here we are now, the same situation
You never listen, I never listen
Everybody's hurt somebody before
Everybody's been wound by somebody before
You can change but you'll always come back for more
It's a game and we are all just victims of love
Everybody's hurt somebody before
Everybody's been wound by somebody before
You can change but you'll always come back for more
It's a game and we are all just victims of love

Don't try to fight it, victims of love
You can't decide it, victims of love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, victims of love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, victims of love1Embed
