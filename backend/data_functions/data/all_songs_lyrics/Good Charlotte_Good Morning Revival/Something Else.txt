Something Else Lyrics
She is a diamond, I am a stone
I come from nowhere, she's been to Rome
Her daddy's a lawyer and mine's not around
She has good manners, I'm rough all around

But you could come from something
You could come from nothing
You could be a princess
You could be a working man, but in the end

We all want something else (We all want something else)
We all want something we can't have
We all want something else (We all want something else)
We all want something strange to us

Maybe a roll in the dirt, or it's a seat in first class
We all want something we can't have

She wants to go to restaurants in Beverly Hills and people stare
But I don't care, it's just what she grew up around
She drags me to parties where people ask me where I went to
College, she knows damn well I barely finished school
She knows a lot about yearly salaries and trust funds and
Dividends, she knows that I don't really care at all
But we got together
And it's working okay
You could come from something
You could come from nothing
You could be a princess
You could be a working man, but in the end

We all want something else (We all want something else)
We all want something we can't have
We all want something else (We all want something else)
We all want something strange to us

Maybe a roll in the dirt, or it's a seat in first class
We all want something we can't have

Well, you can spend your whole life looking for something
Something that might be right
In front of your eyes, but you'll be looking for something
Else you'll never find

We all want something else (All want something else)
We all want something we can't have
We all want something else (All want something else)
We all want something strange to us
We all want something else (All want something else)
We all want something we can't have
We all want something else (All want something else)
We all want something strange to us
Maybe a roll in the dirt, or it's a seat in first class
We all want something we can't haveEmbed
