All Black Lyrics
Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like The Rolling Stones want to paint it black
Like the night that we met, all black
Like the colour of your dress, all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red, now it's just all black

As long as I could remember
I dreamed in black and white
As I grew up and the sun went down
I never felt more alright
My mother she used to tell me
"Son, you better get to church!
It's a dark, dark world and there's evil out there
And you know it's only getting worse..."
Yeah, I've never been much for weddings
Or anniversaries
But I'll go to a funeral if I'm invited
Any day of the week
Some people say that I sound strange
Some say that I'm not right
But I find beauty in this world
Every single night
Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like The Rolling Stones want to paint it black
Like the night that we met, all black
Like the color of your dress, all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red, now it's just all black

I sat down at her table
At the end of the night
She was having black coffee and a cigarette
She wasn't wearing white
She said, people tell me that I'm strange
They say that I'm not right
She said, "The only time I feel alive is in the dead of night"
I think I found the one for me

Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like The Rolling Stones want to paint it black
Like the night that we met, all black
Like the colour of your dress, all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red, now it's just all black
I remember feeling so alive
The night I looked into her eyes

Take a look at my life, all black
Take a look at my clothes, all black
Like Johnny Cash, all black
Like The Rolling Stones want to paint it black
Like the night that we met, all black
Like the colour of your dress, all black
Like the seats in my Cadillac
I used to see red, I used to see red!

Take a look at my life (all black)
Take a look at my life (all black)
Take a look at my life (all black)
All black, all black
Take a look at my life (all black)
Take a look at my life (all black)
Take a look at my life (all black)
All black, all black, all black, all black, all blackEmbed
