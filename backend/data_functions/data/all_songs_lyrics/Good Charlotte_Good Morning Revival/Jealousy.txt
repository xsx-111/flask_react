Jealousy LyricsFor every lie I ever told, for every line I ever sold
For everyone I ever hurt before
I could always find a good excuse
I could always find something to use
I could always find a way out of the truth
Well it used to feel okay inside to get in their face and tell these lies
But not today... I'm breaking free
Jealousy, look what you've done
You've got a hold of me, you've made me become
Thought I'd never be what I'm running from
This jealousy look what its done
I never thought the day would come to say sorry for the things I've done
I know the list is long but that's all on me
I can't really find the words to make up to ones I've hurt
But I hope they see this side of me
I swear that I've been waiting, I've been waiting, to say
Oh Jealousy, look what you've done
You've got a hold of me, you've made me become
Thought I'd never be what I'm running from
This jealousy look what its done
You rip apart my insides
You know that I can't sleep
You tear apart my whole life
You take the best of me...
Oh Jealousy, look what you've done
You've got a hold of me, you've made me become
Thought I'd never be what I'm running from
This jealousy look what its done
Oh jealousy, Oh jealousy, look what you've done
You've got a hold of me, you've made me become
Thought I'd never be what I'm running from
This jealousy look what its done
You rip apart my insides (this jealousy)
You know that I can't sleep
You tear apart my whole life (this jealousy)
You take the best of me...
Oh JealousyEmbed
