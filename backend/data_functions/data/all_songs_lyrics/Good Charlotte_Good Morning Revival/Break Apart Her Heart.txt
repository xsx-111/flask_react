Break Apart Her Heart Lyrics
When you call, she doesn't answer
When you write, she doesn't answer
You go out, you see him with her
She told you she was sick at home
The ring you gave her
Thrown away with all the letters
And when you see him with her
He doesn't even care at all
And she follows him around like you follow her around
And he doesn't even care and you figure it out
The only way you're going to keep somebody around
Well, I'm about to let you know

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart, her heart

Can't you see the way she's crying
Well, that's what keeps her trying
She knew that she could have you
And he don't give her what she wants
There's truth about this
You say you want to be noticed
Well, if you want to be noticed
You got to learn to break some hearts
Don't try to understand

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart, her heart

Can you see, what you've done
What I've become, what I've become
Can't you see? Can't you see?
I don't understand this cruelty, I don't understand, but now I see

There's something I don't want to understand
The only way a woman's going to want a man
The only way you'll ever keep her in your hands
Is breaking apart her heart
Don't tell her she's the reason that you live
Don't give her everything that you've got to give
If you want to keep the girl for as long as you live
Just break it apart, her heart
I don't understand this cruelty
I don't understand, it's just not me
I don't understand this cruelty
But now I see1Embed
