Where Would We Be Now Lyrics
I smile, you laugh, I look away
I sigh, you ask me "Why?" I say
"It's okay and I am
Just feeling down"
Your hand on mine, I hear the words
"If only love had found us first
Our lives they would be
Different, oh..."

But that was not the plan, oh

Where would we be now, baby, if we found each other first?
What would you do now, darling, if I said these simple words?
I'll wait, I'll wait, as long as you want
But where would we be now, baby?

And now I must confess
That I am a sinking ship
And I'm anchored by the weight of my heart
'Cause it's filled with these feelings
But I keep my true thoughts locked
Beside my heart's black box
And it won't be found, it won't survive
Through the smoke or the wreckage
So I crash and burn, oh...

Where would we be now, baby, if we found each other first?
What would you do now, darling, if I said these simple words?
I'll wait, I'll wait, as long as you want
But where would we be now, baby?

I'll wait, I'll wait

Where would we be now, baby, if we found each other first?
What would you do now, darling, if I said these simple words?
I'll wait, I'll wait, as long as you want
But where would we be now, baby?

I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait, I'll wait...2Embed
