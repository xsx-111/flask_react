A Beautiful Place Lyrics
Mother, can we start over?
I want to be the boy I was back then
Before the world came, made me colder
I want to feel the way I did back then

With love in my heart

We live in a beautiful place, let love take away all this pain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh
We wasted so many days, our hearts are as dark as the rain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh

Father, can we start over?
Take me to the places that we lived
All the days came, made us older
I want to feel the way I did back then

Before my heart grew cold

We live in a beautiful place, let love take away all this pain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh
We wasted so many days, our hearts are as dark as the rain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh, ah oh
Our hearts are as dark as the rain, ah oh
Our hearts are as dark as the rain, ah oh
It's a beautiful place if we make it
It's a beautiful place to be wasted, don't you know?
We live in a beautiful place, let love take away all this pain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh

We live in a beautiful place, let love take away all this pain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh, ah oh
We wasted so many days, our hearts are as dark as the rain
We live in a beautiful place, ah oh1Embed
