Broken Hearts Parade Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Here we go!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

We got problems, we don't know how to solve them
Everywhere we go, we got some skeleton's that follow
We got baggage, you know we're going to drag it
Everywhere we go, for everyone to see

And the broken hearts parade
And I'm putting my heart out on display
There's no masquerade
Just a funeral march for love today

The band strikes up and they're playing our song
Dressed in black and we're singing along
To the broken hearts parade
And I've never been better then I am today
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh, oh!
You got a question, how do we get it started?
I got an answer, let go of your heart and
Love it, live it, leave it, and get into it
If you want to start it, this is how you do it

And the broken hearts parade
And I'm putting my heart out on display
There's no masquerade
Just a funeral march for love today

The band strikes up and they're playing our song
Dressed in black and we're singing along
To the broken hearts parade
And I've never been better then I am today

I used to lie awake at night and wonder when she's coming home
It used to be so hard to wake up everyday

The broken hearts parade
And I'm putting my heart out on display
There's no masquerade
Just a funeral march for love today
The band strikes up and they're playing our song
Dressed in black and we're singing along
To the broken hearts parade
And I've never been better then I am today

March on to the soul
The beating of a broken heart
Stop, put the rhythm to bed
To the beating of a broken heartEmbed
