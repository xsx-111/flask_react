The River Lyrics
As I walk through the valley of the
Shadow of L.A
The footsteps that were next to me have
Gone their separate ways
I've seen enough now to know that beautiful things don't
Always stay that way
I've done enough now to know this beautiful place isn't
Everything they say

I heard that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels, I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city, was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong, but I swear I'm a believer

Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered
You're from a small town, you're going to grow up fast
Underneath these lights
Down in Hollywood on the boulevard, the
Dead come back to life
To the praying Mother and the worried Father, let your
Children go
If they come back, they'll come home stronger, and if they
Don't, you'll know

They say that evil comes disguised
Like the city of angels, I'm walking towards the light

Baptized in the river
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered
In the city, was a sinner
I've done a lot of things wrong, but I swear I'm a believer

Like the prodigal son, I was out on my own
Now I'm trying to find my way back home
Baptized in the river
I'm delivered, I'm delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
On my own
On my own
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
Baptized in the river (On my own)
I wanna be delivered
I confess I'm a sinner
I've seen a vision of my life and I want to be delivered13Embed
