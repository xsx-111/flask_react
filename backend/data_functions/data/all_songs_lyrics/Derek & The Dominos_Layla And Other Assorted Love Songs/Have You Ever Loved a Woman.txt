Have You Ever Loved a Woman LyricsHave you ever loved a woman
So much you tremble in pain?
Have you ever loved a woman
So much you tremble in pain?
And all the time you know, yeah
She bears another man's name
But you just love that woman
So much it's a shame and a sin
You just love that woman, yes
So much it's a shame and a sin
But all the time you know, yes you know
She belongs to your very best friend
Have you ever loved a woman
And you know you can't leave her alone?
Have you ever loved a woman, yes
And you know you can't leave her alone?
Something deep inside of you
Won't let you wreck your best friend's home1Embed
