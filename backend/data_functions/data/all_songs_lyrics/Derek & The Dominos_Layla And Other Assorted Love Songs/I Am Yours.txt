I Am Yours Lyrics
I am yours
However distant you may be
There blows no wind, but wafts your scent to me
There sings no bird, but calls your name to me
Each memory that has left its trace with me
Lingers forever as a part of me

I am yours
However distant you may be
There blows no wind, but wafts your scent to me
There sings no bird, but calls your name to me
Each memory that has left its trace with me
Lingers forever as a part of me

I am yours
However distant you may be
There blows no wind, but wafts your scent to me
There sings no bird, but calls your name to me
Each memory that has left its trace with me
Lingers forever as a part of me

I am yours2Embed
