Little Wing LyricsWell, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running around
Butterflies and zebras and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
And when I'm sad, she comes to me
A thousand smiles she gives to me free
Said it's all right, take anything you want from me
(Anything you want, babe) (Anything)
Well, she's walking through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running around
Butterflies and zebras and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
And when I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
Said it's all right, take anything you want from me, baby
(Anything you want) (Anything)
Whoo
Fly on little wing
Baby, babyEmbed
