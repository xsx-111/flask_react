Tell the Truth Lyrics
Tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who's been fooling you?

There you sit there looking so cool
While the whole show is passing you by
Better come to terms with your fellow men soon cause
Whole world is shaking now, can't you feel it?
New dawn is breaking now, can't you see it?

Tell the truth, tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who's been fooling you?

It doesn't matter just who you are
Or where you're going or been
Open your eyes and look into my heart
Whole world is shaking now, can't you feel it?
New dawn is breaking now, can't you see it?

I said, "See it, yeah, can't you see it?
Can't you see it, yeah, can't you see it?
I can see it, yeah"
Tell the truth, tell me who's been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who's been fooling you?

Hear what I say cause every word is true
You know I wouldn't tell you no lies
Your time's coming, gonna be soon, boy
Whole world is shaking now, can't you feel it?
New dawn is breaking now, can't you see it?

"See it" Yeah, I said, "See it", I said, "See it"

Whole world is shaking now, can't you feel it?
New dawn is breaking now, can't you see it?
I said, "See it", I said, "See it"
Just see it
Just see it
Just see itEmbed
