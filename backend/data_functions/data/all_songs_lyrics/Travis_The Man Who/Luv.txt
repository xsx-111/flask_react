Luv LyricsWhat's so wrong
Why the face so long, is it over
And where you going that you no longer belong here
And distance tells you that distance must come between love
Where have you been, luv
When the mistake we made was in never having planned to fall in love, luv
Singing this song, singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so, in letting you go
It only serves to show me that I'm still in love with you
Singing this song, singing along
Makes it easier for me to see you go
But in doing so, in letting you go
It only serves to show me that I'm still in love with you
So what's so wrong
Why the face so long, are you changing
And where you've been to that you no longer remember
And distance tells you that distance must come between love
Where have you been, luv
When the mistake we made was in never having planned to fall in love, luv
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, luv
It's just the chance we took
Having never ever planned to fall in love, luv
