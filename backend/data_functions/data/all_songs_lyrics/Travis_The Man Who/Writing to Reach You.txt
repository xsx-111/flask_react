Writing to Reach You Lyrics
Every day I wake up and it's Sunday
Whatever's in my head won't go away
The radio is playing all the usual
What's a wonderwall anyway?

Because my inside is outside
My right side's on the left side
Cause I'm writing to reach you
But I might never reach you
I only want to teach you, about you
But that's not you

It's good to know that you are home for Christmas
It's good to know that you are doing well
It's good to know that you all know I'm hurting
It's good to know I'm feeling not so well

Because my inside is outside
My right side's on the left side
Cause I'm writing to reach you
But I might never reach you
I only want to teach you, about you
But that's not you
Do you know it's true
And that won't do
Maybe then tomorrow will be Monday
And whatever's in my head should go away
Still the radio keeps playing all the usual
And what's a wonderwall anyway?

Because my inside is outside
My right side's on the left side
Cause I'm writing to reach you
But I might never reach you
I only want to teach you, about you
But that's not you
Do you know it's true
And that won't do
You know it's you
I'm talking toEmbed
