The Fear Lyrics
All I wanted was the chance to say
I would like to see you in the morning
Rolling over to have you there
Would make it easy for a little bit longer

But here
Closer every year
So near
The fear is coming clear
My dear
The fear is here

Hottest summer in a hundred years
But summer didn't bother
Getting up this morning
And so all the trees forgot to wake
They were dropping all their leaves
On the ground below them

But here
Closer every year
So near
The fear is coming clear
My dear
The fear is here
All I wanted was the chance to say
I would like to see you in the morning
Rolling over to have you there
Would make it easy for a little bit longer
Make it easy for a little bit longer
Make it easy for a little bit longer
Make it easy for a little bit longer
Make it easy for a little bit longer
Make it easy for a little bit longerEmbed
