Distraction LyricsIlluminate me please I need a distraction
From all this sense that just descends from the skies
All the trees all the birds and the bees
When it's falling time we fall in line
I get distracted from the heart of the matter
As bright lights blind and take my mind
From the fact that attack that is keeping me back
From the real life it feels like
All the little things I miss are
Making up what all this is
I'm living driven to distraction
I get an answer then it slips away from me
Before I tell somebody else and
Just when I thought it was safe in the water
I'm sinking
I'm thinking
That all the little things I miss are
Making up what all of this is
I'm living driven to distraction
And all the action somewhere else where
Just when I think i've got somehwere
I'm back distracted wondering what's out there
Well now all the little things I miss are
Making up what all this is
I'm living driven to distraction
I'm living driven to distractionEmbed
