The Distance LyricsDo you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember
How you were gonna stay free?
But they had plans for you
And things to do
The same thing goes for me
Well well I never
Saw it coming to me
But when I turned around to look at you
It was all that I could do
To see the distance
Everybody wants to run
And I'm no different
Feeling like the only one
In the beginning
Everything was so close
And it seemed that everywhere you go
Everybody knows
You don't remember
What you wanted to be
Well they went round the class
And you were last
The clock was fast
So no one asked
To see the distance
Everybody wants to run
And I'm no different
Feeling like the only one
Well how long can you run?
How far and what for?
How far will you run
To get whatever you're after
Year after year after year
Well I've been looking
But I still can't see
How we get from a to b to c
And feel like we should be
Well I've been running
But I've been running around
Now there's nothing left for me to do
But sit around and see the view
And see the distance
Everybody wants to run
And I'm no different
Feeling like the only one
Do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?Embed
