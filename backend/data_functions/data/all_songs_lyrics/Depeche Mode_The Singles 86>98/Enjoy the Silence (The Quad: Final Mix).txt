Enjoy the Silence (The Quad: Final Mix) LyricsPart One

Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the...

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the... silence
Part Two


Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Part Three

Part Four
...the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence

"If you're here, take a trip with the whip."
"Come on, let's take a trip. Tell the people where it's at."

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Enjoy the silence

Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silenceEmbed
