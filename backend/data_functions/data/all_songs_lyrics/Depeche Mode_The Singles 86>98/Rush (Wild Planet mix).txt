Rush (Wild Planet mix) LyricsWalk with me
Open your sensitive mouth and talk to me
Hold out your delicate hands and feel me
Couldn't make any plans to conceal me
Open your sensitive mouth
Hold out your delicate hands
With such a sensitive mouth
I'm easy to see through
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you
Cry for you
Seen the tears roll down from my eyes for you
Heard my truth distorted to lies for you
Watched my love becoming a prize for you
Seen the tears in my eyes
Heard my truth turn to lies
Seen the tears in my eyes
I'm not proud of what I do
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you
I come up to meet you
Up there somewhere
When I rush to greet you
My soul is bared
Gave more for you
Dropped my crutches and crawled on the floor for you
Went looking behind every door for you
And because of the things that I saw for you
I spiritually grew
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you
I rush for youEmbed
