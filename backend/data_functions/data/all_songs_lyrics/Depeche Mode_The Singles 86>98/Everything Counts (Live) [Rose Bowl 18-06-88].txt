Everything Counts (Live)  Lyrics
The handshake seals the contract
From the contract, there's no turning back
The turning point of a career
In Korea being insincere
The holiday was fun-packed
The contract still intact

The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves, after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves, after all
It's a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts

The graph on the wall
(The graph, the graph)
Tells the story of it all
(The graph, the graph)
Picture it now, see just how
(The graph, the graph)
The lies and deceit gained a little more power
(The graph, the graph on the wall)
Confidence taken in
(The graph, the graph)
By a suntan and a grin
(The graph, the handshake)
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves, after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves, after all
It's a competitive world
"Sing it!"
Everything counts in large amounts
Everything counts in large amounts


The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts

Everything, everything
Everything, everything

The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts
"Thank you! Thank you all very much! See you next time! Goodnight, thank you!"Embed
