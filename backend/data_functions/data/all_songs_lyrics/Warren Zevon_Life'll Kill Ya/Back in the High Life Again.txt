Back in the High Life Again Lyrics
It used to seem to me that my life ran on too fast
And I had to take it slowly just to make the good parts last
But when you're born to run it's so hard to just slow down
So, don't be surprised to see me in the brighter part of town

And I'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
I'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in

And I'll drink and dance with one hand free
Let the world back into me
Oh, I'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life again

You used to be the best to make life be real to me
And I hope that you're still out there and you're like you used to be
We'll have ourselves a time and we'll dance 'til the morning sun
We'll let the good times come in, we won't stop until we're done

And we're back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in
And we'll drink and dance with one hand free
Have the world so easily
Oh, we'll be a sight to see
Back in the high life

We'll be back in the high life again
All the doors I closed one time will open up again
We'll be back in the high life again
All the eyes that watched us once will smile and take us in

Back in the high lifeEmbed
