I Was in the House When the House Burned Down Lyrics
I had the shit 'til it all got smoked
I kept the promise 'til the vow got broke
I had to drink from the lovin' cup
I stood on the banks 'til the river rose up
I saw the bride in her wedding gown
I was in the house when the house burned down

I may be old and I may be bent
But I had the money 'til it all got spent
I had the money 'til they made me pay
Then I had the sense to be on my way
I had to stay in the underground
I was in the house when the house burned down

I was in the house when the house burned down
I met the man with the thorny crown
I helped him carry his cross through town
I was in the house when the house burned down


I was in the house when the house burned down
I met the man with the thorny crown
I helped him carry his cross through town
I was in the house when the house burned down
I had the shit 'til it all got smoked
I kept the promise 'til the vow got broke
I had to drink from the lovin' cup
I stood on the banks 'til the river rose up
I saw the bride in her wedding gown
I was in the house when the house burned downEmbed
