Fistful of Rain Lyrics
You can dream the American Dream
But you sleep with the lights on
And wake up with a scream
You can hope against hope
That nothing will change
Grab a hold of that fistful of rain

Grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Ooh)
Grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Ooh)
Grab a hold of that fistful of rain

When your grasp has exceeded your reach
And you put all your faith
In a figure of speech
You've heard all the answers
But the questions remain
Grab a hold of that fistful of rain

Grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Ooh)
Grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Ooh)
Grab a hold of that fistful of rain
And when diamonds turn back into coal (Ooh, ooh)
Grab a hold, children, grab a hold
When the mountains crumble (Ooh, ooh)
And you're ready to rumble
And roll like a runaway train (Ooh, ooh)


And when diamonds turn back into coal (Ooh, ooh)
Grab a hold, children, grab a hold
When the mountains crumble (Ooh, ooh)
And you're ready to rumble
And roll like a runaway train (Ooh, ooh)

In a heart, there are windows and doors
You can let the light in
You can feel the wind blow
When there's nothing to lose
And nothing to gain
Grab a hold of that fistful of rain

Grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Ooh)
Grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Ooh-ooh)
Grab a hold of that fistful of rain
Grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Ooh)
Grab a hold (Grab a hold), grab a hold (Ooh-ooh)
Grab a hold (Fistful of rain)
Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold of that fistful of rain
Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold of that fistful of rain
Grab a hold, grab a hold, grab a hold of that fistful of rainEmbed
