Secret Love Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen
Come on, come on, come on
Ladies and gentlemen
Mariah, Mariah
Ladies and gentlemen
'Cause we go a little something like this
Hit it!

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

It was a summer's day when walking by
She didn't notice as as you turned
And you discreetly winked your eye
And I remembered you from back in the day
You were the boy I couldn't breathe without
The one that got away
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

Now that I found you, I cannot let you go
You know I got my man at home
But baby, I still need you so
And I know you ain't never leaving that girl
But every time you touch me, baby
It feels so incredible

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

Secret lovers, yeah
You and me
You and me
You and me, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love, baby

Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now, baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love, baby

Baby, baby, baby
Come give it to me, baby
We got a secret love, darling
Keep it between us, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Come give it to me, baby
We got a secret love, darling
Keep it on the hush, baby1Embed
