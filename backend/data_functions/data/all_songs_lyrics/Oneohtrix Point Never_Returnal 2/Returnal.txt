Returnal Lyrics
Another silo full, another dark dawn
Bending the air, love is so small
Visualize dark thoughts, it was in a dream
Internet as a self-atomizing machine
I designed it, reset, she's the cure
Underground, search for more

Returnal
You've never left, you've been here the whole time
Returnal
You've never left, you've been here the whole time

Another silo full another dark dawn
Bending the air, love is so full
My desire to see the light, my desire to be pure
Underground I visualize sighing ocean dream

Returnal
You've never left, you've been here the whole time
Returnal
You've never left, you've been here the whole time
Returnal
You've never left, you've been here the whole time
Returnal
You've never left, you've been here the whole time

Returnal
You've never left, you've been here the whole time
Returnal
You've never left, you've been here the whole time1Embed
