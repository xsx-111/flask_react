Painter in Your Pocket Lyrics
And I'm reminded
Of the time that I was blinded
By the sun
It was a welcome change
From the sight of you hanging
Like a willow
Off the arm of yet another visionary
Profitous East Van. Punk

I didn't stand a chance
I couldn't stand at all
You looked OK with the others
You looked great on your own
It was 2002 and you couldn't be bothered
To say hello or goodbye
Or stand the test of time
You did, I just tried to
Separate an ocean from these tears we cried
(Whoooo)

Where did you get that line?
Where did you get that look?
Where did you get that penchant for destruction in the way you talk?
Where did you get that ride?
Where did you get that rocket?
Where did you get that painter in your pocket?
Hey, there's Christine
And there's where she could've been
The summer season was cheap
Birds of prey stick together
And hey so do we
(Go)

I didn't stand a chance
I couldn't stand at all
You looked OK with the others
You looked great by yourself
It was 2002 and you needed reminding to stay alive
And so did I, but at least I tried to
Fall upon that sword and never look back
(Ahh)

Where did you get that line?
Where did you get that look?
Where did you get that penchant for destruction in the way you talk?
Where did you get that ride?
Where did you get that rocket?
Where did you get that painter in your pocket?
Where did you get that line?
Where did you get that look?
Where did you get that penchant for destruction in the way you talk?
Where did you get that ride?
Where did you get that rocket?
Where did you get that painter in your pocket?
I didn't stand a chance
I didn't stand at all
You looked OK with the others1Embed
