A Dangerous Woman Up to a Point Lyrics
A Dangerous Woman Up To A Point once said
"As per your wishes, I left you for dead
I left England for the English"
Is it always the one thing or the other with you?
"Forgive them, my lord, they know not what they do!"
"Hey, your friends are fucked, insofar
As your friends are an ancient beast bronzed in tar!"

Have I told you lately that I love you?
Did I fail to mention there's a sword hanging above you?
"Those who love Zeppelin will soon betray Floyd"
I cast off those couplets in honor of the void
I was here to stay, I would weather the storm
I pictured heaven on earth made of clay, as your form dictated

I went down to the garden with the noblest of intentions
I felt the need to be brief
I stuck a rose between my teeth and had a laugh
The sun sets at the speed of light
So I thought I also might
Leave this port of woe
On tall ships made of snow invading the sun
A Dangerous Woman Up To A Point once said
"I've never read 'so-and-so' so why mention him here
In this square where culprits axe me, my dear?
Tried to enjoy myself at the Society Ball, really I did
Froze on Union Street, it was springtime, I was just a kid
Lost in a map of the stars, oh, it's called "your eyes"
It was a trap, it was a good time, it was hard to realize, oh!

I can't win, I can't even walk
Oh, baby, you should talk
Baby, you should hear what you're saying
They said, "Don't look back!" but I looked back
It was a bore, it was a fucking horror
It wasâ€” well, honey, you know quite well what you are!

A Dangerous Woman Up To A Point once said
"People come, and people go
And people lie nameless in the snow"Embed
