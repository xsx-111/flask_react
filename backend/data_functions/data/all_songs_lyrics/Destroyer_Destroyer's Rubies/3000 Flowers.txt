3000 Flowers LyricsShe was part of an inner circle
Daughters of the motherland
Like a ship lit up at sea with scars where it's talons used to be
Scars where its talons used to be
Scars where its talons used to be
I was a slow learner, I moved in flourishes
I was a late bloomer, I moved in flourishes
Last man on the scene
Fresh face on a dying scene
One hundredth of a wet, black bough
One hundredth of a wet, black bough
One hundredth of a wet, black bough
I was Clytemnestra on a good day
Dispensing wisdom to the uninitiated
The initiates brought out in tumbrils
Shed out by the dawn
Shed out by the dawn
Shed out by the dawn
Like a woman, I was kept
As the wealthy American underground wept
At the sight of Rhode Island sinking into the sea
And the sky still reigned supreme over the land
As the music lovers sat cross-legged in the sand
And in time, and in space and—in other words—in a band
Who, much like churchgoers...
And the sky still reigned supreme over the land
As the music lovers sat cross-legged in the sand
And in time, and in space and—in other words—in a band
Who, much like churchgoers, fuck themselves upEmbed
