Your Blood Lyrics
I went for you in military times and then I waited well into the 2300s
I made my way through the Union Street design kids

They were alright, they were on fire
They harbored an elementary desire to do good works
I bought 'em all! I bought 'em all!
I made donations to the Plague, and the Fall and the Old Gray Mare in her stall

Endangered Ape, a couple years in solitary never really hurt anyone
Distinguished colleagues, dead music writers' brides: I apologize

They were alright, they were on fire
They harbored an elementary desire to do good works
I bought 'em all! I bought 'em all!
I made donations to the Plague, and the Fall and the Old Gray Mare in her stall

I don't know, I guess I'm doing alright, Tabitha takes another stab at becoming light
She never wants to go, always wants to stay illuminated

I ride towards the dawn, Quicksilver on the side of nothing
Never had a chance, never had to choose "Your Blood" versus "Your Blues"
Ride towards the dawn, Quicksilver on the side of nothing
Never had a chance, never had to choose "Your Blood" versus "Your Blues"Embed
