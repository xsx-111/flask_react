Rubies LyricsDueling cyclones jackknife
They got eyes for your wife and the blood that lives in her heart
Cast myself towards infinity
Trust me, I had my reasons
Had a dress for every season, it was worth it
Pulled into town relatively free of hassle
Secured a room at the castle, it paid for itself
Checked out my surroundings, headed down to Thornton Park
Find your way
Discover that things are dark
Shadowy figures babbling on about typical rural shit
I wave bye to them in a modern way and increase my stay at the
Dock of the bay
Quiet, Ruby, someone's coming
Approach with stealth
Oh, it's just your precious American Underground
And it is born of wealth
With not a writer in the lot
Sapphires vie for your attention
Cheap dancers, they mean well in their way
But Priest says - "Please, I can't stand my knees
And I can't bear her raven tresses caught up in a breeze like that
Blessed doctor, do your worst
Cut me open, remove this thirst
Hidden, but near
A series of visions, I won't repeat them here
I won't repeat them here
Typical me, typical me
I gave my cargo to the sea
I gave the water what it always wanted to be
Look to the West!
"Ah look it's no contest," Proud Mary said as she lit the fuse
"I wanted you, I wanted your blues"
Your blues
"All good things must come to an end
The bad ones just go on forever."
Isn't that what I just said?
It is now and it is never
It is now and it is never
It is now and it is never
It is now and it is never
Don't worry about her
She's been known to appreciate the elegance of an empty room
Look, I made you this broom
A predicate warning to the sun -
This night advances on
The sketchy crowd shows me drawings, they're alright
An alternately dim and frightful waste
Now come on honey let's go outside
You disrupt the world's disorder just by virtue of your grace, you know
I didn't want to go, but leave I must
As gratifying as this dust was
Please don't wake me from this
My golden slumber
I am proud to be a part of this numberEmbed
