Sick Priest Learns to Last Forever LyricsMake a mockery of the courts, receive your sentence, and take the fall
The Strata Council sees your face and decides to declare you 'a doll.'
That's ok, yes it's fine…
You've been the same, most every time…
A sick priest will learn to last forever…
Molly begets herself
She plans a merger with The Scene
An insider breathes word of this and, surprise!, it turns to steam…
That's ok, yes it's fine…
He's been the same, most every time…
A sick priest will learn to last forever…
Founding Fathers, oh what have you found?
Your daughter's face, a sweet embrace, and a commoner's less than sacred
Place…
Take it back, there's a world underground!
In spite of Western Sacrifice, we auction off the sword
But Damascus never asked us to write a song about being bored with Our Lady Of This Immaculate Currency…
Gut yourself!
It's a one-man job on the altar of the Beast
To make it legal, Wilhelm's bride goes bulemic at the feast
That's ok, yes it's fine…
She's been the same, most every time…
A sick priest will learn to last forever…
Founding Fathers, oh what have you found?Embed
