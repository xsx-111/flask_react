European Oils LyricsI made a tomb for all the incompatible cells I could take
And I brought bells to the wake
And you, you didn't mind
Shedding your beautiful European blood
As I screamed, "Death to the murderers we've loved all our lives!"
I was good with names
I had a way with faces
And I was the dominant theme in a number of places
And you, you didn't mind
Mixing your beautiful European oils for a still life
Oh Candice, we should've run for our lives!
When I'm at war I insist on a slaughter
And getting it on with the hangman's daughter
She needs release
She needs to feel at ease with her father -
The fucking maniac!
I made a tomb for all the incompatible cells I could take
And I brought bells to the wake
And you, you didn't mind
Shedding your beautiful European blood
As I screamed, "death to the murderers we've loved all our lives!"
Desperate times call for desperate measures
I wanted you
I wanted these treasures, tooEmbed
