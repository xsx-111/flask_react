Mofo Lyrics
Lookin' for to save my, save my soul
Lookin' in the places where no flowers grow
Lookin' for to fill that God-shaped hole
Mother, mother-suckin' rock 'n roll
(Mother)

Holy dunc, space junk comin'Â­ in for the splash
(Been around the back, been around the front)
White dopes on punk staring into the flash
(Been around the back, been around the front)
Lookin' for the baby Jesus under the trash
(Been around the back, been around the front)
Mother, mother-suckin' rock 'n roll
(Mother)
Mother, mother-suckin' rock an' roll
(Mother)

Mother, oh, Mother
Mother, Mother, Mother

Mother, am I still your son?
You know I've waited for so long
To hear you say so
Mother, you left and made me someone
Now I'm still a child, but no one tells me no
Lookin' for a sound that's gonna drown out the world
(Been around the back, been around the front)
Lookin' for the father of my two little girls
(Been around the back, been around the front)
Got the swing, got the sway, got my straw in lemonade
(Been around the back, been around the front)
Still lookin' for the face I had before the world was made
(Been around the back, been around the front)
Mother, mother-suckin' rock an' roll
(Mother)
Bubble popping sugar dropping rock 'n roll (Mother)
Mother, mother suck, yeah, fuck yeah (Mother)

Mother, Mother, Mother
Mother, Mother, Mother

Soothe me, Mother
Rule me, Father
Move me, Brother
Woo me, Sister
Soothe me, Mother
Rule me, Father
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother
Show me, Mother1Embed
