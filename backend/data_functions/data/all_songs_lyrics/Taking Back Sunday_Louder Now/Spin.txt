Spin Lyrics
That look was priceless, don't let me get carried away
I've seen it before, and it still suits you the same
(You catch on quick!) You catch on quick!
The cynics deaf, before they give the same reviews
(You catch on quick!) You catch on quick!

Oh oh, now this is where, where the party is
Are you coming home? (Well, are you coming home?)
Are you coming home? (Well, are you coming home?)

You had your chance! (You had your chance!)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)
You had your chance! (You had your chance!)
Open arms reject assuming hands

The abortion that you had, it left you clinically dead
And made it all that much easier to lie
But that's nothing that I'm proud of (No, it's nothing that I'm proud of)
I'm making an example out of you (But this is phase one)
This is a preview (But this is phase one)

Oh oh, now this is where, where the party is
Are you coming home? (Well, are you coming home?)
Are you coming home? (Well, are you coming home?)
You had your chance! (You had your chance!)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)
You had your chance! (You had your chance!)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)

Don't act like you're the first one
I treat it like disease
Sure it's rough around the edges
It's the only thing you see
Don't act like you can't see me, darling, coming
And act like you don't see me, darling, coming
And act like you don't see me, darling, coming
And act like you don't see me, darling

You had your chance (You had your chance)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)
You had your chance (You had your chance)
Open arms reject assuming hands (arms reject assuming hands)
You had your chance
You had your chance (You had your chance)Embed
