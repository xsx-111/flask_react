My Blue Heaven Lyrics
Two sides twist and then collide
You're calling off the guards (Am I coming?)
I'm coming through (Am I coming?)
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)

And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

Dull heat rises from the sheets
I'm both a patient boy
Well, and a jealous man (Am I coming?)
My double standardized suspicion
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven
Sometimes, it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)
And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
"You're safe, child, you are safe
(You're safe, child, you are safe)
You're safe, child, you are safe"
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
"You're safe, child, you are safe
You're safe, child, you are
Safe (Safe), safe (Safe)
You are safe"
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
"You're safe, child, you are safe" (Am I coming?)
"You're safe, child, you are safe" (Am I-)
Coming through?
Is this all too familiar?
Does it happen all the time?
I'm just asking you to hear me
Could you please, just once, just hear me?
More than anything you wanted to be right
Still it's you, you, it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)
It's you I can't deny1Embed
