Error: Operator LyricsWell there's been an accident (calm down)
There's been an accident, breathe
In and out calm down (in and out calm down)
Breathe in and out calm down (in and out calm down...)
We can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back, we can't...
We can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back, we can't...
(Breathe in and out calm down)
Well would you do it again, again
And count backwards from ten
(Look I don't make those mistakes no more)
Sometimes I swear I can see straight through you
Just concentrate, control
But would you do it again, again
We can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back, we can't...
We can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back, we can't...
We can't go back
Can't go back
Can't go back, we can't...
We can't go back
Can't go back
Murder, Oh murder, oh where have you been? 
Sometimes I swear I can see right through you
Concentrate, Concentrate, Control, Concentrate
This doesn't feel like anything
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't...
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't...
We can't go back, can't go back, can't go back, we can't...
(Feels like anything anything, anything anything)Embed
