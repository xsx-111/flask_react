Divine Intervention Lyrics
Despondent, distracted
You're vicious and romantic;
These are a few of my favorite things
All of those flavors and
This is what you choose:
Past the blues, past the blues
And on to something new

Something real, make it timeless
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted
So if you're calling me out
Then count me out

Yeah, we're stubborn and melodramatic
A real class act
You see, I know a few of your favorite things
Five in the morning and all comes out pouring
Love, out the same way in

Something real, make it timeless
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted
Now if you're calling me out
Then count me out
Something real, make it timeless
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted
I said real, make it timeless
An act of God and nothing less will be accepted
Now if you're calling me out
Then count me out
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mmmm2Embed
