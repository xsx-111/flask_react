Up Against (Blackout) Lyrics
So this is what we're up against?
So this is what we're up against?

Face it
This is what we're up, up against
You're waiting
And every minute is a minute away
Face it
This is what we're up, up against
You're waiting
And every minute is a minute away

Regrets always work
Excuses are better
A practical exchange
Or a trade for the truth
But you know it never held up (but you know it never held up)
Pretend that it's still good now

Face it
This is what we're up, up against
You're waiting
And every minute is a minute away
Face it
This is what we're up, up against
You're waiting
And every minute is a minute away
We're turning our clocks back
We're just never ourselves
So go with the flow
Just relax (just relax)
You never feel the jet lag
Unless you're trying to fit in

Face it
This is what we're up, up against
You're waiting
And every minute is a minute away
Face it
This is what we're up, up against
You're waiting
And every minute is a minute away
(every minute is a minute away)

Less is more except when it comes to mistakes
How long is long? That depends how long it takes
Less is more except when it comes to mistakes
How long is long? That depends how long it takes
The years, not months
Not days, you blackout memories
The years, not months
Not days, you blackout memories
Face it
This is what we're up, up against?
You're waiting
And every minute is a minute away
Face it
This is what we're up, up against?
You're waiting
And every minute is a minute away
(every minute is a minute away)
Every minute is a minute
And a minute and a minute awayEmbed
