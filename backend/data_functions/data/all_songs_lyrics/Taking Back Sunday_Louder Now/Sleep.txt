Sleep Lyrics
Yeah!

Well, we assure you the procedure is safe and routine
Dramamine sends haunting dreams
(Dramamine sends haunting dreams)
With an incessant drip, sinus pockets like a faucet
'Cause you have to work hard for
(Yeah you work hard for what you've got)
Yeah you have to work hard for
(Yeah you work hard for what you've got)
Yeah you worked and now you're

Local anesthesia, teases, local anesthesia, teases
Local anesthesia, teases, local anesthesia
Sleep oh! sleep oh! sleep oh!
We'll breathe the sweet air through your nose
Sleep oh! sleep oh! sleep oh!
We'll breathe the sweet air through your nose

Something practiced is something perfect
I'm selfishly slimming because
The season's got us eating less and less (less and less)
You walk the full length of Manhattan in no time flat
While your soles they were stuck sticking to every step
(Yeah you work hard for what you've got
Yeah you work hard for what you've got
Yeah you worked and now you're)
Local anesthesia, teases, local anesthesia, teases
Local anesthesia, teases, local anesthesia
Sleep oh! sleep oh! sleep oh!
We'll breathe the sweet air through your nose
Sleep oh! sleep oh! sleep oh!
We'll breathe the sweet air through your nose

Local anesthesia, teases, local anesthesia, teases
Local anesthesia, teases, local anesthesia, teases, makes you
Sleep Oh! sleep oh! Sleep oh!
We'll breathe the sweet air through your nose
Sleep oh! sleep oh! sleep oh!
We'll breathe the sweet air through your nose

Yeah you work hard for what you've got
Breathe the sweet air through your nose
Yeah you work hard for what you've got
Yeah you work hard for what you've got
Yeah you work hard for what you've got
Yeah you work hard for what you've got
Yeah you work hard for what you've got
Yeah you worked and now you're...Embed
