Brooklyn (If You See Something, Say Something) Lyrics
Well you are worth more than the man I am
Sad and in love, hands trembled of life that we would have stolen
Anyway, stolen
Well, anyway

To Brooklyn, I'm homebound
A trap to the east
Marking miles of martyrs
Of better men, of better men than me
And I wanted to tell you, I just didn't know

Genuine and unprepared
If you, you see something then you should say something
If you, you see something could you just say something
Genuine and unprepared
If you, you see something then you should say something
If you, you see something could you just say something
Say something

Something awful itches in these walls
I found a subtle genius in that white, hot hatred of yours
Misuse is practice, perfected and played
In time I'm gonna get what's mine
To Brooklyn, I'm homebound
A trap to the east
Marking miles of martyrs
Of better men, of better men than me
And I wanted to tell you, I just didn't know how

Genuine and unprepared
If you, you see something then you should say something
If you, you see something could you just say something
Genuine and unprepared
If you, you see something then you should say something
If you, you see something could you just say something
Say something

Oh, we are going, we're going, we're
Once, twice, three times, sold!
You're better off believing everything you heard was true
You're better off believing everything you heard was true
You're better off believing everything you heard was true
You're better off believing everything you heard was

Genuine and unprepared
If you, you see something then you should say something
If you, you see something could you just say something
Genuine and unprepared
If you, you see something then you should say something
If you, you see something could you just say something
You say something
Say somethingEmbed
