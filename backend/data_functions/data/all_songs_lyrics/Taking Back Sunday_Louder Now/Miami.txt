Miami Lyrics
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
Stop me if you've heard this one before
The whole truth is nothing but a good excuse
So long as you don't torture me with my past
Let's be honest; a secret silenced is a secret safe

Miami, Miami, Miami
Well every hour on the hour
(every hour on the hour)
You have to, you just have to trust me
Whoever I was then
I can't ever be again

Reminders, they are not reluctant
So stop me if you've heard this one before
Sideways blinders
I can't find a way around (a way around)
A way around

Miami, Miami, Miami
Well every hour on the hour
You have to, you just have to trust me
Whoever I was then
I can't ever be again
The faith you found I've never felt (never felt), never felt
The terror held in wedding bells
And comfort in there's no one else
The truth be told I'm never gonna know

Miami Miami Miami
Well every hour on the hour (every hour on the hour)
Unhand me, God damn me, Miami
Whoever I was then I can't ever be again

The terror held in wedding bells
The comfort in there's no one else
The truth be told I'm never gonna know
The terror held in wedding bells
The comfort in there's no one else
The truth be told I'm never gonna knowEmbed
