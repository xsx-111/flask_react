Twenty-Twenty Surgery Lyrics
I'll take with me every single luxury when I leave you could
Count on me for that and nothing more
(Count on me for that and nothing more)
The view from this side's not what
The view from this side's not what
I thought it'd be, promise something differently
Close our eyes and let go of the wheel

It's not the quantity that bothers me
(no it's not the quantity that bothers me)
No it's not the quality that bothers me
It's the means

Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty twenty surgery for cheap
Dollar signs doll up a picture perfect point of view
Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty twenty surgery for cheap
For cheap, dollar signs are up, for picture perfect point of view

Well all young children listen, cause they've got so much to learn
(Turn it in, turn it in)
We'll get you home in time to make the rent (should be for free for being me)
It's not the quantity that bothers me
(No it's not the quantity that bothers me)
No it's not the quality that bothers me
It's the means

Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty twenty surgery for cheap
Dollar signs doll up a picture perfect point of view
Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty twenty surgery for cheap
For cheap, dollar signs are up, for picture perfect point of view

I do, I don't need you like you think
I do, I don't, I don't need you like you think
I do, I don't, I don't need you like you think
I do, you don't you just don't
Don't leave me alone

Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty twenty surgery for cheap
Dollar signs doll up a picture perfect point of view
Twenty-twenty surgery
Well, twenty twenty surgery for cheap
For cheap, dollar signs are up, for picture perfect point of view
You're so sensitive
I am, I am a machine
You're so sensitive
I am, I am a machine
You're so sensitive
I am, I am a machine
You're so sensitive
I am, I am a machineEmbed
