MakeDamnSure Lyrics
You've got this new head filled up with smoke
And I've got my veins all tangled close
To those jukebox bars you frequent
The safest place to hide
A long night spent with your most obvious weakness, you start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
'Cause you are everything I'm not

And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
(How close is close enough?)
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close

I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way

My inarticulate store-bought hangover hobby kit it talks
And it says "You, oh, you are so cool"
Scissor-shaped across the bed
You are red, violent red
You hollow out my hungry eyes
You hollow out my hungry eyes
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close
(How close is close enough?)
And we lay, we lay together
Just not too close, too close

I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way
I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way
Worst way

I'm gonna make damn sure
That you can't ever leave
No, you won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me
I'll make damn sure
That you can't ever leave
No, you won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me
You won't ever get too far from me (Ever get too far)
You won't ever get too far
I just wanna break you down so badly
Well I trip over everything you say
Well I just wanna break you down so badly
In the worst way
Worst way

I'm gonna make damn sure
I just wanna break you down so badly
I just wanna break you down so badly (Down so)
In the worst way
