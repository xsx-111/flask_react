Nine Eyes LyricsI took a strangely disembodied walk down memory lane
To the home of my late mother and my youth
Under the full glare of a hot LCD sun
I rode nine eyed survivor Street View
Like the last of the liquidators before lights out
Or the first returned to Pripyat, my nine eyed scout
It wasn't at all distressing, just a wilderness
Something you can do while you are home alone in bed
Seems I'm all I need
I'm finally on my own
Yeah I'm all I need
I'm finally on my own
And everything was just like I remembered it to be
Everything was like 25 years before me
I spied through all the windows, surveyed the lawns
But what kind of asshole drives this lime green Commodore?
He ain't got no right to be here
That's my name in the curb
My number on the letter box
My gold fishy being interred
I learned to ride my bike here
I learned the golden rule
But then forgot what it was, which suits me fine
I like things being elliptical
Yeah I'm all I need I'm
Finally on my own
Yeah I'm all I need I'm
Finally on my own
I took all that I wanted
When I was here before
But now I'm back to loot what's left
I can't get in the door
I guess I need to know
If I'll be safe here on my own
But who's this asshole living here now
Calling my house his home?
He's pleased like I'm the first by here
In years, or leaving last
Hidden under gums in his Gyprock dump
With his flat screen and my past
He laughs himself dry at me outside
With nine unsatisfied termites
I shut them all down and they go to ground
Then I shut down all the lights
Yeah I'm all I need I'm
Finally on my own
Yeah I'm all I need I'm
Finally on my own1Embed
