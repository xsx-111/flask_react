I See Seaweed LyricsI see seaweed on the lawn
There's no point coming here no more
Do you remember way back when?
When weeks sank in the swimming pool
Holidays were cotton wool
Your bald tyre friends, the pelicans, cowboys and indians
Admit it, she was kinda cute
Her panties were your parachute
They found her near the airport, in a crater, near the bend
Where she and I'd walk by the zoo
Not knowing we'd do what all plagues do
I forget her all the time these days and be forgotten too

We're lockstepping in our billions
Lockstepping in our swarms
Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be born
I was fine but not the whole time, see
I fiddled while Rome stewed, and lord
It choked my heart, but spades are spades
My head's here now to tell you

We're lockstepping in our billions
Lockstepping in our swarms
Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be born
And ain't that just the way things are
Yeah you always went too far
And ain't that just the way things go
Passports please, sir you are next
Do you fly direct or indirect?
As the years bleed off that answer's getting harder to detect
Like all the rare air on the cabin floor
Your in-flight film's a score that should be settled
Once the holster calcifies around your neck
But now it's prefab bars, tax free cigars
Stopovers in Bahrain
And they put horse tranqs in the fuel tanks and the staff are all insane

And we're lockstepping in our billions
Lockstepping in our swarms
Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be born
I'm like a Lockheed in a thunderhead
An Airbus in the sea
The sky is blue, I am too
Yet everything seems clear

And we're lockstepping in our billions
Lockstepping in our swarms
Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be born
But ain't that just the way things are
Yeah you always went too far
But ain't that just the way things go
She'd recollect how fucked you were
All matter of a fact
And then defend you, being squeamish about the knife stuck in her back
And lord, she only sang the dead Byrds' songs
And now I know 'em all
It's like I'm shooting at a shadow
That a bomb burned on the wall

And we're lockstepping in our billions
Lockstepping in our swarms
Lockstepping in the certainty that more need to be born
There ain't no making what you're breaking
Nothing left of her to clone
I can't remember how she looked although
I do recall her smile coming down the telephone
But ain't that just the way things are
Yeah you always went too far
And ain't that just the way things go
Yeah pretending you don't knowEmbed
