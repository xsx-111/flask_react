The Grey Leader LyricsThe grey leader now speaks
And in his company
We have tendered the turds of the past
And there'll soon be a day
Where it's all disarray
And who'll know what to do with the parts
And they'll say I was wrong
I was right all along
Although nothing would ever change your mind
Its hard to be frank
As a carpenter's plank
While a flood sucks you clear of the side
The grey leader first seeks
About all that he speaks
Through the spyglass he holds back to front
And he's stricken his ship
On the taxiderm dock
And the whole crew's for sale if you want
And he'll say that I'm wrong
And be right all along
As long as custom dictates wrong and right
The good times are dead
They're too complicated
Although nothing would ever change your mind
Nothing here changes
Except quantities
Real monsters have manners at sea
They talk law and order
Be very discreet
While the big kick the small down the street
He don't make peace with God
They always got along
It's all love and a misunderstanding
He opened the cage
And the bird flew away
And if you need any proof
He's still up on the roof
Ooohhhhhh yeah
Nothing would ever change your mindEmbed
