Repeating LyricsSoon as the storm ends they'll come to hawk
Hand-built the highway, it was the soaring I first saw
Then in a waste end, where they call air home
Take it till the footsteps, at the lower end comb
Then no word
From the right I call you
Where the wild wild slip
Tremble light it goes, I hardly knew
Feel the weight in the hoisting of truth
We delay every horse in the kingdom
We divert every flow to a sinkhole
Then we stare at the ruin of a signal
To repeat every word as it sings out
Then no word
From the right I call you
Where the wild wild slip
Tremble light it goes, I hardly knew
Feel the weight in the hoisting of truth
I would hang by my hands from the wall
That was stable and made further fall
As the side of the town did appear
We received in a mixing of fear
Not a fate or a cost in this place
Nothing real to be bought or replaced
And the heat sending patterns alongs
To repeat what had finally gone
I would swear it had all stopped at once
I could see what the current had brung
Underneath the arrival of june
It repeats or is coming up soon
Tremble light it goes
I hardly knew
In and out of focus out of view
Tremble light it goes
I hardly knewEmbed
