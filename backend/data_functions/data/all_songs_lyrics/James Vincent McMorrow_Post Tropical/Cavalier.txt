Cavalier Lyrics
Speak until the dust settles in the same specific place
Light refused to go, drink it from a cast and iron plate
Instead of cold milk, was offered unripe
Instead of silence, considered craven
Nothing made it seem, hidden where the aging soil was pure
Pressed against the crease
Mountains become fragrant at the source
So can you stand this exotic angle?
I read it somewhere that they would lie still

I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love

Unrelied, I was called, missing teeth, out of favour
Nickel beach, it was all gathering by the sundial
I woke hard, I woke heavy
For the half way stop, five whole hours in
When I woke hard, I woke heavy
With the live or parts
And I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love
I remember my first love
I remember how cloth hung
Flexing with the forest clung
Half waist and high raised arms
Kicking at the slightest form
I remember my first love
I remember my first love
I remember my first love30Embed
