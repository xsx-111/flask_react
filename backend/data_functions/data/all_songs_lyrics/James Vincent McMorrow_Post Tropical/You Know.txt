You Know LyricsYou're my love, your love is all I ever want
You're my love, your love is all I ever want
You're my love, your love is all I ever want
You're my love, your love is all I ever want
You took my hand out from the rain
Looked me over, so much love
You took my hand out from the rain
Looked me over, so much love
You know, you know, you know, you know it
You know, you know, you know, you know it
You know it, you know it
'Cause you're my love and your love is all I ever want
'Cause you're my love and your love is all I ever want
You took my hand out from the rain
Looked me over, so much love
You took my hand out from the rain
Looked me over, so much love
You know, you know, you know, you know it
You know, you know, you know, you know it
You know it, you know it
You took my hand out from the rain
Looked me over, so much love
You took my hand out from the rain
Looked me over, so much love
You know, you know, you know, you know it
You know, you know, you know, you know it
You know it, you know itEmbed
