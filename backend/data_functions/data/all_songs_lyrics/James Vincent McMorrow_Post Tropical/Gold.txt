Gold LyricsHow was the cold
Along the path I determined to hold
Although it coiled round a perilous wing
Blinded by hot gas and carving off steam
There was still smoke
Burnt in the grass
Reclaim a portion of desolate south
Add in the stirrings and long lost fatigue
Barrels that hide us a hair fallen heed
Then became sound
I wasn't afforded a love
Covered up in hard earned clay
I wasn't accorded a stop
Always in it so much more
I wasn't afforded a love
Covered up in hard earned clay
Time wasn't the only cavernous
I hope my contour charts show up via rivers
Out to the only ocean
There's something peaceful that goes out via river
Out to an ocean
I was peaceful, standing, I was open
I wasn't afforded a love
Covered up in hard earned clay
I wasn't accorded a stop
Always in it so much more
I wasn't afforded a love
Covered up in hard earned clay
Time wasn't the only cavernous
Time wasn't the only cavernous
Time wasn't the only cavernous
Time wasn't the only cowardEmbed
