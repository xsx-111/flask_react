Glacier LyricsSomeone here's a liar
Somewhere underneath
Caught between the reeling
Mirroring the beat
I no longer fish
Ended years asleep
Saw no sense of holding
Staring aimless leave
I want to go
South of the river
Glacier slope
In the heart of the winter
I want to go
South of the river
Face it alone
In the heart of the winter
And this will celebrate
This will settle
There an honest day
This is a mistake
To damn the earth below
Dam the earth removed
Damp and clawing evening
Bursting into tune
In a moment i was caught
From the current i was safe
In a limit of a half
I want to go
South of the river
Glacier slope
In the heart of the winter
I want to go
South of the river
Face it alone
In the heart of the winter
All ignited at the loft cry heard
Few became
Few became as glorious or unlocked
As the forest they had started living near
Ever since
Ever since the farthest reaching island
We had sighted sheared it's banks and disappeared
Someone hears a liar
Somewhere underneath
Caught between the reeling
Mirroring the beat
I no longer fish
Ended years before
There's no sense of holding
There's no sense at all
I was someone else
I was something pure
Pitting at the armour
Peril at the door
I want to go
South of the river
Face it alone
In the heart of the winter
I want to go
South of the river
Face it alone
In the heart of the winterEmbed
