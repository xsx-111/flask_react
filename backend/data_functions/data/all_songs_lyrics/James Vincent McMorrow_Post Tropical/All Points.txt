All Points LyricsIn decay that I was started young
In devotion in the valley run
It was hoped that time would disappear
In the smoke and when the valley cleared
And I think about the cold air
I been thinking about cold air
I was, in the dark, I was in the dark, I was
I was, in the dark, I was in the dark, I was
It remains an iridescent thing
Fixed at points and stretched around the skin
Every breath that echoes it's relief
Every point to ever let it leave
Still I'm thinking of the cold air
Always thinking of the cold air
I was, in the dark, I was in the dark, I was
I was, in the dark, I was in the dark, I was
Trip in the car, distances used
Lifted it up, kept it with us
Click into motion, never been hurt
Sitting in a fortress down in the dirt
Splitting into fullness I pick it up
And I think about the cold air
Always thinking about cold air
I was, in the dark, I was in the dark, I wasEmbed
