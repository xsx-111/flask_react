When I Leave LyricsSo hot, soak it up
Through more months, â€˜till solid out
Same silly things, same debating all day long
I go out, same parties, with strengths
Expecting nobody
And when I leave, you
Barely hear me no
When the night's up
Kiss me and I'm gone...
I'm with both hands, arms that feast on you
And I know that's no longer now
If you know I could last to ask
I'm alive, though they'll never hear me leave
Cause You made it happen, the way you said it
You made it happen, I know you meant it
You made it happen, you made it happen...
You took my love, it was overrated
You took my love, so I'm waiting..
Some are leaving, some will linger on...
When the night's up
Kiss me and I'm gone...
I'm with both hands, arms that feast on you
And I know that's no longer now
If you know I could last to ask
I'm alive, though they'll never hear me no
And I know that's no longer now
But if you know I could last to ask
I'm alive, though they'll never hear me no
Hear me no...
Expect nobody..
Same silly things, same debating all day long...
I go out, some party, big strength
Expecting nobody
And when I leave, you
Barely hear me go.......
