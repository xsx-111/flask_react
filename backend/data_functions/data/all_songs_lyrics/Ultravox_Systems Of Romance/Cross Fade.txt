Cross Fade LyricsWhere are you, you're waving, the windows were ablaze
We're driving and we're drowning and we're drifting in a daze
We're smoking, we're talking, we re-invent the view
And we're occupying places just as they get removed
Oh, take a cross fade, cross fade
Oh, take a cross fade, cross fade
Oh, take a cross fade, cross fade
Oh, take a cross fade, cross fade
The journey was crazy, I'm trying to close my eyes
We're bypassing some places as they're editing the time
Wake up, you're kneeling, some young man's just gone down
There's a flicker and a flutter and the film is running out
Oh, take a cross fade, cross fade
Oh, take a cross fade, cross fade, cross fade, cross fade
Pictures into structures and structures into motion
Cross over into action, over airways, over ocean
Cross fade, cross fade, cross fade, cross fade...Embed
