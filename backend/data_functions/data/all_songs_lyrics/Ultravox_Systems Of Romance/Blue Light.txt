Blue Light LyricsI thought I'd take the slide
I thought I'd be alright
But when the details swam
Oh, no, the door got jammed
Someone took the hand
And we were out slow dancing
CHORUS
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh
In the blue light, blue light
Blue light, blue light
There was a crowd below
Swanning in the glow
All the paste it shimmered
In the swimmer's glimmer
It was a sticky summer
And I was diving under
CHORUS
Well, nothing drove out behind me
I was so glad
Even the walls were turning round
Well, someone said
There was something wrong
But I couldn't quite
Put my finger on it
What the
Well, I thought I heard
And I tried to
Then we were just diving
