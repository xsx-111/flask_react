Whistle Stop LyricsOooo oooo da waddee
Oooo oooo da waddee
Oooo oooo da waddee
Ooooo oooo
I live in a whistle stop town
Where everyone thinks I'm a clown
Because I like to hear the train whistles blow
Just because the trains never stop
They say that I'm gonna blow my top
But I like to hear the train whistles blow
They don't know that you're coming back to me
One day the train will stop and they will see
I know the train will bring you home
I hope and pray it won't be long
That's why I like to hear the train whistles blow
Bring her back to me
Bring her back to me
Bring her back to me
Bring her back to me
They don't know that you're coming back to me
One day the train will stop and they will see
I know the train will bring you home
I hope and pray it won't be long
That's why I like to hear the train whistles blow
Bring her back to me
Bring her back to me
Bring her back to me
Bring her back to me
Oooo oooo da waddee
Oooo oooo da waddee
Oooo oooo da waddee
