Dose of You LyricsWho in the world ever would have thought it?
Where in the world is the grip on myself?
Why in the world did I ever comment?
What in the world was I thinking of?
Spreading from the hard part first
Is a bad infection getting worse and worse
I caught a dose of you tonight
I need a stiff shot, badly!
I took a lethal dose of you tonight
Oh yeah!
Who in the world are you, pretty baby?
Where in the world did you spring up from?
Why in the world are you so contagious?
How do I get what I've got to get gone?
Specialists among them to themselves
They say there ain't no cure, private or National Health on this one
I caught a dose of you tonight
I need a stiff shot badly
I took a lethal dose of you tonight
Oh yeah!
Spreading from the hard part first
Is a bad infection getting worse and worse
I caught a dose of you tonight
I need a stiff shot, badly!
I took a lethal dose of you tonight
Oh yeah!
I get a sound of thunder...
It's like a heavy gong...
I hear a storm warning...
On every tongue made of silver
Every heel made of high
Every dress made of tight
Ever look, every sigh!
I caught a dose of you tonight
I need a stiff shot, badly!
I took a lethal dose of you tonight
Don't want to spread it all around
I caught a dose of you tonight
I need a stiff shot, badly!
I took a lethal dose of you tonight
So give me pills and powder
I caught a dose of you tonight
I need a stiff shot, badly!
I took a lethal dose of you tonightEmbed
