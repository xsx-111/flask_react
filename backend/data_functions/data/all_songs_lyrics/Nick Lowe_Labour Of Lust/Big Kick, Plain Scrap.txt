Big Kick, Plain Scrap LyricsBig kick, plain scrap
You better shut that trap
Or come and get it
You kick like a mule
You eat like a pig
You drink like a fish
Oh you're a queer one, baby
Oh, when you hold me, in the night
On drugs
You're so nice on drugs
Big kick, plain scrap
You better cut this crap
Or come and get it
You monkey around
You playin' with a horse
You fish, of course
You're a cheap one, baby
Oh when you kiss me, in the night
On drugs
You're so big on drugs
When you clip me, in the night
Yeah, at the Crest Motel
On drugs
On drugs
Drugs, drugs
So nice on drugs
Big kick, plain scrap
You better cut this crap
Or come and get it
You monkey around
You playin' with a horse
You fish, of course
You're a deep one, baby
Big kick
Big kick, plain scrap
Big kick, big kick, big kick, plain scrap
When you kiss me
In the nightEmbed
