Switchboard Susan LyricsSwitchboard Susan, won't you give me a line?
I need a doctor, give me 999
First time I picked up the telephone
I fell in love with your ringing tone
I'm a long distance romancer
I keep on trying till I get an answer
Gimme gimme one more chance
She's a greater little operator
Switchboard Susan, let me off the hook
I've been this way since you give me your look
Switchboard Susan, you're all the rage
Come on sugar, let's get engaged
I'm a long distance romancer
I keep on trying till I get an answer
Gimme gimme one more chance
She's a greater little operator
Said I'm a long distance romancer
I keep on trying till I get an answer
Gimme gimme one more chance
She's a greater little operator
When I'm near you girl, I get an extension
And I don't mean Alexander Graham Bell's invention
Switchboard Susan, can we be friends?
After six, at weekends
I'm a long distance romancer
I keep on trying till I get an answer
Gimme gimme one more chance
She's a greater little operator
She's a greater little operator
Hey babe, you're number's great
38-27-38
Oh you bring a smile to my dial
Oh you're great, operator's greatEmbed
