Born Fighter LyricsWell here she comes again
Blowing everybody's circuits
Girls like that bring a lump to m' pocket
Everybody says I can never get her
I've been a lot of things
But I never was a quitter
I'm a born fighter
I've gotta wriggle for my will now
I'm a born fighter
How I hate it on a plate
Shoe shopping
Lapping up the grooms and uppers
I don't want to have to get
Another pair of hush puppies
I keep on lookin at 47-each
But one day, l'll be laughing
With the lizards on my feet
I'm a born fighter
I've gotta wriggle for my will now
I'm a born fighter
Now I hate it on a plate
I'm a born fighter
I've gotta wriggle for my will now
I'm a born fighter
How I hate it on a plate
Well in between the pages
Of the glossy magazines
There's a coffee table world
I could never ever fit in
I shout about how I could never buy it
But I stand up and fight
For the right to go and try it
I'm a born fighter
I've gotta wriggle for my will now
Said I'm a born fighter
How I hate it on a plate
I'm a born fighter
I've gotta wriggle for my will now
I'm a born fighter
How I hate it on a plateEmbed
