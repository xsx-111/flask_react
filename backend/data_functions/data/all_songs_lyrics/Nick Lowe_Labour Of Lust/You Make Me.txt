You Make Me LyricsYou make me
It's out of my hands
You see
I don't wanna do wrong to you
You make me
You make me
I strive to be strong
But I'm weak
You say what useless excuse is this
You make me
I try with my might
To have and to hold
But there's something to it
That I can't control
See I haven't loosed my love
I'm just confused by love
You make me
You make meEmbed
