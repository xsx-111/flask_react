Skin Deep LyricsPromises promised
In a moment of passion
Melt in the morning
And soon forgotten
Forever and ever
Is just a fun idea
Love and affection
Of the coveted kind
It's just belly to belly
But never eye to eye
A moment to treasure
It's just a matter of time
Skin deep
The way you shake my hand and breathe so fine..
Skin deep skin deep
Yes this is a night of skin deep
Love and affection
Of the coveted kind
It's just belly to belly
But never eye to eye
A moment to treasure
It's just a matter of time
Skin deep
The way you shake my hand and breathe so fine..
Skin deep skin deep
Yes this is a night of skin deep
Heaven is her only for skin deepEmbed
