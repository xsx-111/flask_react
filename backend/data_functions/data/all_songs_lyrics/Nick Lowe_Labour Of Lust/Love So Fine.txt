Love So Fine LyricsWell I met a girl and she made me lose my lines
I don’t do nothing but want her all the time
She makes the Mona Lisa look rough
She's a true fine lover
Don't want no other
So Fine
A love so fine
Each time I see her I can't wait until I see her again
Although she looks like a fire …
I only want to stay close friends
She's got me flapping like a flag on a pole
She's a gas on her back and as a matter of fact she’s so fine
A love so fine
She can’t be after my money
Cause she knows I ain’t got none
She only wanna feel her pretty little body and make out on the floor for fun
Each time I see her I can't wait until I see her again
Tonight I am gonna tell her that I don’t wanna be just friends
She’s got a pair of tits that just won't quit
Everything that she's got you know I like it a lot
She’s so fine
A love so fine
Each time I see her I am getting ready to see her again
Tonight I am gonna tell her hey baby no more folks friends
She starts the love bone shake when the hour is late
And make the backbone quiver when the egg man delivers
She's so fine
A love so fineEmbed
