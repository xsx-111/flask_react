Endless Grey Ribbon LyricsThe cold, dark night
Is split by the stab of twin headlights
Like fingers of guides that know of it
But have never been there
And eyes red-rimmed
Are pealed for the n'th time
And strain for the roadsigns
That flash past the windshield
In the hard drivin' rain
His mind is not dwelling on beds of white linen
But the endless gray ribbon that winds on ahead
A moon comes up, cheesy and golden
Reminding of older times, gunning moter times
Restless and young
A cut glass bowl, free with four gallons
Is now the companion
Of what once was the champion of heartbreakers' row
His thoughts may be thinking of sweet smelling women
But the endless gray ribbon is his for tonight
From Coastacola to Richfolk, Virginia
It's amazing how samey they are
Twenty five buys some time with a waitress
Passion's Peterbuilt out in the car lot
His thoughts may be thinking of sweet smelling women
But the endless gray ribbon is his for tonight
Endless gray ribbon
Endless gray ribbon
Endless gray ribbon...Embed
