DJ LyricsOur fathers said what their fathers said
Whooo-oh
Our mothers did what their mothers did
Whooo-oh
We find each other on the edge of it
Whooo-oh
To be forgiven if we don’t forget
Whooo-oh
You want religion, you want assurance
A resurrection, some kind of purpose
You have the vision, you opened your eyes
A complication, you should have looked twice
You have forgotten how to use your head
Whooo-oh
You got somebody else to paint your fence
Whooo-oh
Is it the body or the evidence?
Whooo-oh
You want it all without the consequence
Whooo-oh
You want religion, you want assurance
A resurrection, some kind of purpose
It’s not what you say, it’s what you take back
I ain't your DJ, you’ve gotta shake thatEmbed
