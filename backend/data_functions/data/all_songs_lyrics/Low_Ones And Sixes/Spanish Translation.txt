Spanish Translation LyricsEverything always confusion
Things I could never explain
Then I saw your Spanish translation
And nothing has since been the same
All that I thought I knew then
Flew out the back of my head
Into the river it bled
Everything once within reason
Falling away like the dust
Naked and dim as an echo
Far away empty of light
Reaching expanding collapsing
Breathing repeating and bright
All that I thought I knew then
Flew out the back of my head
Into the river it bled
Everything once within reason
Falling away like the dust
All that I thought I knew then
Blew out the back of my head
Into the river it bled
Everything once within reason
Falling away like the dustEmbed
