Gentle LyricsGentle, middle, quiet, narrow
Careful, measure
Tortured, stable
It doesn’t have to end this way
But this is where we stand
Conscious, watching, waiting
Silence, listen, hello
Blessing, treading
It doesn’t have to end this way
But this is where we stand
Hell could be a colder place
Feel my breath slipping away
It kills me, even so I stay
I will listen to what you say
Hell could be a colder place
Feel my breath slipping away
It kills me, even so I stay
I will listen to what you say
Hell could be a colder place
Feel my breath slipping away
It kills me, even so I stay
I will listen to what you say
Hell could be a colder place
Feel my breath slipping away
It kills me, even so I stay
I will listen to what you sayEmbed
