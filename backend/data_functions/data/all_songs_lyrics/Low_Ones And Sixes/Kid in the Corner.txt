Kid in the Corner LyricsThey put the kid in the corner
They put the kid in the corner
They put the kid in the corner
They put the kid in the corner
We couldn’t wait any longer
We couldn’t get through the border
We couldn’t wait any longer
We couldn’t get through the border
You put the kid in the corner
Can’t you go any faster?
Can’t you hit any harder?
Can’t you go any faster?
Can’t you hit any harder?
They put the kid in the corner
They put the kid in the corner
They put the kid in the corner
They put the kid in the cornerEmbed
