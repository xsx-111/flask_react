No Comprende LyricsNo, you didn’t understand me
I didn’t say it was a problem
Before you start to make assumptions
Let’s try to cut to the solution
You know we should have seen it coming
You couldn’t wait till it crossed that line
Your hands were tied
No, I do not know the language
(Our house is on fire)
You keep me talking in a circle
(You better get out now
House with desire)
You can’t just throw it in the trailer
(You say it out loud)
You’ve got to stack it so it’s stable
(Our house is on fire)
Got to wind up all the cables
(You better get out now)
Couldn’t wait till it crossed that line
(House with desire)
Your hands were tied
(Desire)
To the last thing you could find
(Desire)
It breaks you every time
On fire
Get out now
House is on fire
Get out nowEmbed
