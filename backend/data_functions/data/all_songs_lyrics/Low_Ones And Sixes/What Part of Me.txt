What Part of Me LyricsWhat part of me don’t you know?
What part of me don’t you own?
What part of me don’t you know?
What part of me don’t you own?
Can’t you see that I’m bleedin' out here?
Waking up from a dreamin' out here
It’s gettin' hard to believe in out here
It’s a 100 degreesin' out here
What part of me don’t you know?
What part of me don’t you own?
What part of me don’t you know?
What part of me don’t you own?
Sometimes it scares me to death
Sometimes it takes all my breath
Talking, talking and pleading all night
It must be somewhere to reach the other side
What part of me don’t you know?
What part of me don’t you own?
What part of me don’t you know?
What part of me don’t you own?
Don’t you know, oh oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-ohEmbed
