Congregation LyricsSometimes
The congregation takes the other side
An inquisition of familiar lies
A grave distraction from a quiet rite
Sometimes
The congregation can't make up its mind
Incarceration creeps up from behind
The implication is its own device
In the middle of a salient fight
Sometimes
The congregation can't be satisfied
Can't be bothered with the ways and whys
Generations like their ways and times1Embed
