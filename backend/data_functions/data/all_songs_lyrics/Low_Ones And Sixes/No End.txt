No End LyricsI couldn’t wait to come back through
To you
I thought I had so much to prove
Untrue
I couldn’t stand and leave you to
Can’t lose the last shrew
That’s true
Wining away the hours and days
Unmade
Anticipating plans and ways
To change
So many things that I can’t take
Away today
It’s too late
Into the night and out again
My friend is away
With no end
With no end
No endEmbed
