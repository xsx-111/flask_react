The Innocents LyricsAll you innocents
Make a run for it
All you innocents
Might be done for it
All you innocents
Make a run for it
All the innocents
Might be done for it
To begin with, thereâ€™s the two of us
Never minding the world
With the armor of a few of us
Losing everything to hope
All you innocents
Make a run for it
All you innocents
Might be done for it
