Lies Lyrics
When they found you on the edge of the road
You had a pistol underneath your coat
But it all started back in '79
Your mother used to work from sunset to 5
And when you knew enough to know where to go
You said you wanted to be out on your own
Why don't you tell me what you really want
Instead of making up the same old lies, lies, lies

You say you must be going out of your mind
And I can see you when I look in your eyes
You're always talking on the end of your tongue
And sweep the ashes underneath the rug
You swear you're having just the time of your life
You've got it wrapped in pretty papers and white
Why don't you tell me what you really want
Instead of making up the same old lies, lies, lies
Lies, lies, lies
Lies, lies, lies

Oh, baby, we gotta go
The shadow's taking its toll
We're not winning anymore
Time is keeping score
It's the blind leading the blind
One can handle the night
Oh, it's not what I wanna say
But I'll say it anyway
When I saw you on the edge of the road
You had a pistol underneath your coat
I should be sleeping by your lonely side
Instead of working on this song all night1Embed
