Into You LyricsI can’t explain
The slowing of my brain
The underlying vein
That flows right into you
Trace of oil and shell
Penetrate the well
Tired to be so frail
It flows right into you
Right through the tomb
Below what’s new
Right into you
It flows right into you
Right through the tomb
Below what’s new
Right into you
La la la la
