Landslide LyricsTalk it out loud
Talk to myself
A stone in a cloud
Silence in hell
Look at the smile
Broken like teeth
Torn at the mouth
Loosing our feet
Caught in a landslide
Let it all out
Scream till you bleed
Thereâ€™s no coming back
The South China Sea
So, you call me brother
Sister, I plea
Out of our minds
And out of our league
Call it a landslide1Embed
