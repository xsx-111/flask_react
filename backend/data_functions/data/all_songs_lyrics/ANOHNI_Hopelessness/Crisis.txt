Crisis Lyrics
Crisis
If I killed your father
With a drone bomb
How would you feel?

Crisis
If I killed your mother
With a drone bomb
How would you feel?

Father
If I killed your children
With a drone bomb
How would you feel?

Crisis
If I tortured your brother
In Guantanamo
I'm sorry

I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Now you're
Cutting heads off
Innocent people
On TV

Daughter
If I filled up your mass graves
And attacked your countries
Under false premise

I’m sorry
I’m sorry
I’m sorry
I’m sorry

Ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh
I, I’m sorry, I, I’m sorry
Ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh
I, I’m sorry, please, please
I’m sorry, yeah
Ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh
Ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh1Embed
