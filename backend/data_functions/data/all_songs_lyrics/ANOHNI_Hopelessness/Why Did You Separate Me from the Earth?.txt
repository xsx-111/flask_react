Why Did You Separate Me from the Earth? Lyrics
Why did you separate me from the earth?
Oh my God
Why did you separate me from the earth?
My father

You drew lines miles high in steel or nuclear
The forests of Borneo, and white water in your mouth
I don't want your future, and I'll never return
I'll be born into the past, I'm never, never coming home

Why did you separate me, me from the earth?
What did you stand to gain?
Why did you separate me from the earth?

The rotten bodies threaded gold, the pitch of hair and sticky meat
The sea life cut with plastic, a white cross gilded gold
A case of white doves laying in the boiling snow
A sharp knife of concrete, the blue line of tuna's throat

I don't want your future, I'm never, never coming home
I don't want your future, I'll be born before youâ€™re born
Why did you separate me, me from the earth?
What did you have to gain?
Why did you separate me from the earth?
What did you have to gain?
Why did you separate me from the earth, from the earth, from the earth, from the earth?
What did you have to gain?1Embed
