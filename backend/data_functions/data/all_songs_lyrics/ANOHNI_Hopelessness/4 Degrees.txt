4 Degrees Lyrics
It's only 4 degrees, it's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees, it's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees, it's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees, it's only 4 degrees

I wanna see this world, I wanna see it boil
I wanna see this world, I wanna see it boil
It's only 4 degrees, it's only 4 degrees
It's only 4 degrees, it's only 4 degrees

I wanna hear the dogs crying for water
I wanna see the fish go belly-up in the sea
And all those lemurs and all those tiny creatures
I wanna see them burn, it's only 4 degrees

And all those rhinos and all those big mammals
I wanna see them lying, crying in the fields
I want to see them, I want to see them burn
I want to see them, I want to see them burn

I wanna see them burn, it's only 4 degrees
I wanna see them burn, it's only 4 degrees
I wanna see them burn, it's only 4 degrees
I wanna burn them, I wanna burn them
I wanna burn them, I wanna burn them

I wanna burn the sky, I wanna burn the breeze
I wanna see the animals die in the trees

Ooh, let's go, let's go, it's only 4 degrees
Ooh, let's go, let's go, it's only 4 degrees
Ooh, let's go, let's go, it's only 4 degrees
Ooh, let's go, let's go, it's only 4 degrees

I wanna burn them, I wanna burn them
I wanna burn them8Embed
