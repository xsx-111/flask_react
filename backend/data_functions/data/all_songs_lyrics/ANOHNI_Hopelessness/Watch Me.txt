Watch Me Lyrics
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!

Watch me in my hotel room
Watch my outline as I move from city to city
Watch me watching pornography
Watch me talking to my friends and my family

I know you love me (Daddy!)
'Cause you're always watching me (Daddy!)
I know you love me (Daddy!)
'Cause you're always watching me (Daddy!)

Protecting me from evil
Protecting me from terrorism
Protecting me from child molesters
Protecting me from evil

Watch me
Watch me, watch me
Watch me
Watch me, watch me
Watch me in my hotel room
Watch my iris as I move from city to city
Watch me watching pornography
Watch my medical history

Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!

I know you love me
'Cause you're always watching me
I know you love me
'Cause you're always watching me

'Case I'm involved in evil
'Case I'm involved in terrorism
'Case I'm involved in child molesters (Daddy!)
'Case I'm involved in evil

Daddy! Daddy!3Embed
