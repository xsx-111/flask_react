Execution Lyrics
Execution
Execution
Execution
It's an American dream

Have no mercy on me
Please don't have mercy
Don't let them prove I was wrong
When we know so bad what's right
Don't let them dig up my grave
Sometimes a feeling is reason enough

It's an American dream
Execution
Execution

Like the Chinese, and the Saudis
The North Koreans, and the Nigerians
Like the Chinese, and the Saudis (Execution)
The North Koreans, and the Nigerians (Execution)

It’s an American dream
It’s an American dream
It’s an American dream
It’s an American dream
It’s an American dream
Execution, it’s an American dream
It’s an American dream
Execution, it’s an American dream
It’s an American dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

If Europe takes it away
Inject me with something else
Inject me with something else (Execution)
Fill me up with something else
And if they try to take our love away (Execution)
Please don’t have mercy! (It's an American dream)
And if they try to take our love away (Execution)

Like the Chinese and the Saudis (Execution, execution)
(America, America)
The North Koreans and the Nigerians
(Please don't have mercy)Embed
