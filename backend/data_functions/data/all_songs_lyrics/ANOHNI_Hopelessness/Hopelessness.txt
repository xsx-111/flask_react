Hopelessness Lyrics
How did I become
The mother of this son?
The face and mind
And hands of virulence?

I, who curled in cave and moss
I, who gathered wood for fire
And tenderly embraced
How did I become a virus?

Hopelessness
I feel the hopelessness
Hopelessness
I feel the hopelessness

I don't care about me
I feel the animals and the trees
They got nowhere
They got nowhere to go

I don't care much about you
I don't give a shit what happens to you
Now we blew it all away
We blew it all away
Hopelessness
I feel the hopelessness

Hopelessness
Hopelessness
Hopelessness
Hopelessness

How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness
How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness
How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness
How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness

I've been taking more than I deserve (Hopelessness)
Leaving nothing in reserve (Hopelessness)
Digging till the bank runs dry (Hopelessness)
I've been living a lie (Hopelessness)
How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness
How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness
How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness
How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness
How did I become a virus?
Hopelessness
How did I become?
