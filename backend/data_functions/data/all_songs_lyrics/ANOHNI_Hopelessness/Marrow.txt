Marrow Lyrics
In the, in the countryside, under the streams
Suck the, suck the marrow out of her bones
Inject, inject, inject me with chemotherapies
Suck the, suck the money out of her face

We are, we are all Americans now

Africa, Iceland, Europe, and Brazil
China, Thailand, India, and Great Britain
Australia, Borneo, and Nigeria

We are, we are all Americans now

Suck the, suck the oil out of her face
Burn her, burn her, burn her hair, and boil her skin

We are, we are all Americans now3Embed
