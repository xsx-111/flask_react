Obama Lyrics
When you were elected
The world cried for joy
We thought we had empowered
The truth-telling envoy

Now the news is you are spying
Executing without trial
Betraying virtues
Scarring closed the sky

Punishing the whistle blowers
Those who tell the truth
Do you recognise the yellow
Staring back, back at you?

Obama

Obama
All the hope drained from your face
Like children, we believed
All the hope drained from your face
