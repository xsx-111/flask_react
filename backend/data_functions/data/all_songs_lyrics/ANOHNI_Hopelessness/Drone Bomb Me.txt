Drone Bomb Me Lyrics
Drone bomb me
Blow me from the mountains, and into the sea
Blow me from the side of the mountain
Blow my head off, explode my crystal guts
Lay my purple on the grass

I have a glint in my eye, I think I wanna die
I wanna die
I wanna be the apple of your eye

So, drone bomb me, drone bomb me
Blow me from the mountains, and into the sea
Blow me from the side of the mountain
Blow my head off, explode my crystal guts
Lay my purple on the grass

Let me be the first
I'm not so innocent
Let me be the one
The one that you choose from above
After all, I'm partly to blame
So, drone bomb me, I'm partly to blame
Blow me from the mountains, and into the sea
I'm partly to blame
Blow me from the mountains, and into the sea
I wanna die
Iâ€™m not so innocent
I'm partly to blame
Blow my head off
Explode my crystal guts

My blood, my blood, my blood
Choose me, choose me, choose me tonight
Choose me
Let me be the one
The one that you choose tonight
Choose me tonight, tonight9Embed
