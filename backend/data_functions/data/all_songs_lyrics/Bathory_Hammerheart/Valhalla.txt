Valhalla LyricsGod of thunder
Who crack the sky
Swing your hammer
Way up high
In chariot of gold
Ride across the clouds
The black storm is unfold
Burning mist is but a shroud
Seeds and honey
Milk and blood
A sacrifice
To thunder god
Laid in ship of oak
On final sail to fate
Steel is at side
Drifting to the open gates of
Valhalla
Shields of gold
Valhalla
Great warriors hall
I swing my sword in the wind
I feel the powers all within
Valhalla
Valhalla
God of thunder
Lightning rain
The winds of glory
Whispers your name
Pounding pounding
Of hooves and wheels
Forks of lightning
At your heels
Sword of steel
Held up high
Lightning strikes
From blackened skies
Fallen heroes
In battle slain
Awaits my arrival
At the gates of
Valhalla
Shields of gold
Valhalla
Great warriors hall
I raise my fist to the air
In the creed of powers and glory swear
Valhalla
Shields of gold
Valhalla
Great warriors hall
I swing my sword in the wind
I feel the powers all within
Valhalla
Shields of gold
Valhalla
Great warriors hall
I raise my fist to the Air
In the creed of powers and glory swear
Valhalla...1Embed
