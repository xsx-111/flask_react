Father to Son LyricsFather To Son Father To Son
Father To Son From Father To Son
Now born my son I name thee
After the sound of my Hammers
Beat upon the anvil
On this chilly springtime day
The Hammerchild of my flesh
Of my blood to carry on
When I have reached Oden's end
Of my glorious warrior's trail
From Father To Son From Father To Son
Call upon the spirits of our fathers
Long time gone with thunder
Ask them for truth and courage
When trouble is in your way
Learn to read and understand
The signs to few can clearly vision
Listen carefully to what
The Ravens has to say
Oh, hear the Thunder's roar
Greetings from our fathers long time gone
Tell so that no one ever will forget
What is in heart goes from Father to Son
From Father To Son From Father To Son
Oh, watch the lightning strike
Feel the powers of the Hammers pounding on
Take it to your heart and understand
What must live on from Father to Son
From Father To Son From Father To son
Promise me my son to always
Cherish what is home to you
What is the truth and to
Defend all of your race
Never lose the values
I have taught to you
Always keep your moral and ideals
Do never bring your flag disgrace
From Father To Son From Father To Son
Promise me my son before my corpse
Is turning pale to
Grab my sword hold it to the sky
And call out my hail
Listen for the bronze horns
Watch the lightning strike then
You know I have reached Oden's end
Of my warrior's trail
Oh, my child please take heed
Through you I am granted to live on
These words more worth than you will ever know
Make them live on from Father to Son
From Father To Son From Father To Son
From Father To Son From Father To SonEmbed
