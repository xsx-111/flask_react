Home of Once Brave LyricsOut of the water
The cold black Nordic sea
Risen towards the eternal sky
The land lays open and free
Up high the Mountains
Where the wind catch its speed and chill
Snowstorms are born
And rage loud through the valleys and the hills
Above two Ravens
Messengers of the wise One eyed God
Who rules this land
Of the strong and the great
And tall
Beautiful
Behold this thy land
Open and free
This thy home of the brave
Dark endless forest
Where at the day hides the shadows of the night
Snowcovered vast lands
As great as the eternal sky
Now in the midst
Of this wild and this open and free
He placed my kind
To possess this their land to be
Above two Ravens
Messengers of the wise one eyed God
Who ruled this land
Of once strong and once great
But now
Forgetting to behold this their land
Once ours (once) free
This my home of once brave
