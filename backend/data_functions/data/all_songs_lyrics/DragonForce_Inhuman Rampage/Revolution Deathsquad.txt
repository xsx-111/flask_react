Revolution Deathsquad Lyrics
Flying over darkened skies the battle will call
Distant angels crying in the eye of the storm
And the world falls under the starlight shining from heavens below
Long years of pain and sorrow searching for more
Cry for the touch of angels never before
And the stars fall on the horizon onwards and up through the pain

Ride the wind and fight the demon steel shining bright
Standing together forever onwards flames burning strong
Hot wind in hell of pain and sorrow now and ever onwards
We stare into the dawn of a new world

Cry out for the fallen heroes
Lost in time ago
In our minds they still belong
When the sands of time are gone

Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power
Crossing valleys endless tears in unity we stand
Far and wide across the land the victory is ours
On towards the gates of reason
Fight for the truth and the freedom
Gloria
Searching through the memories to open the door
Living on the edge of life like never before
And the ground chants under the moonlight facing their fears all the same

Heavens fear now open wide and up for the the call
All in stark reality the angels will fall
And the world cries out for the silence lost in the voices unknown

Blinded by the force of evil cries into the night
Never before have they seen the darkness now they are all gone
Out from the shadows storming on the wings of revelations
Your soul will feel no mercy come the dawn

Hold on for the morning after
Never to let go
When the fire's burning strong
And the tides of time roll on

Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power
Crossing valleys endless tears in unity we stand
Far and wide across the land the victory is ours
On towards the gates of reason
Fight for the truth and the freedom
Gloria
Cry out for the fallen heroes
Lost in time ago
In our minds they still belong
When the sands of time are gone

Rise over shadow mountains blazing with power
Crossing valleys endless tears in unity we stand
Far and wide across the land the victory is ours
On towards the gates of reason
Fight for the truth and the freedom
Gloria, gloria, gloria4Embed
