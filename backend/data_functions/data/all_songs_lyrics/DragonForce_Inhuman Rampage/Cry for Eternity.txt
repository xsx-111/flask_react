Cry for Eternity LyricsFalling from the sky now, the sign of the burning sun
Into the face of the evil one
Nowhere to hide now we're on the run right before your eyes
We're watching, we're waiting, our souls are forsaken
The sign of the warriors, the evil will rise
Through the fire and the flames, breaking the chains
Into the night we go
Torment and pain trample the slain
Soldiers of death we know

Our steel will shine forever through the night and blinding rain!
We'll see them face their fears; it's time to rise again in everlasting pain

Fly free for what we believe
One thousands hearts bleeding the eternal dream
Feel me the touch we all need
So silently now we will kneel
Cry for eternity
See now the fallen will live again
They feel the pain burn inside of them
Remember now what you feel again deep down inside
Still cursing still crawling we're endlessly falling
The downfall of mankind the fate of us all
Hold your hands to the sky bleed and you cry
Screaming until we know
Dying in pain again and again
Onwards to hell below
Stand strong we'll live forever raging through the barren lands
Our eyes have seen the sorrow far across the sands
The power in our hands



Fly far away to the end of our days
The voices of long distant cries
Now we remain in this labyrinth of pain
And so we ride into the night


Cry for eternity
