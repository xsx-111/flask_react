Lost Souls in Endless Time LyricsSpend all our lives
On what we believe in
Struggle day by day
But never retrieving
Taking our chances
And follow the footsteps
Ancestors will take us to this fight
At the time it was blistering snowing
Never really know about
Where we were going
Time is coming now
To cross over
Here and now until
The curtain lowers
Slaying all the evil down below
Onwards we ride now
To what we know
Strong enough to stay
And carry on forever
Brace your soul
To fight whenever
Never know how far we travelled
We will have our stand
Across the deepest oceans
Gold is in our hands
Good things will come
For those who wait we can't deny
Still the battle raging and the fire burns inside
Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind
For the souls lost in endless time
Searching never ending
For the chaos ascending
You forgot the spirits
All times pretending
Passing shades of darkness
In the world around you
Finally insanity
In death has found you
On the edge of life
Trying to pull you under
Deep inside the storm
There's a raging thunder
Sacrifice your innocence
For persecution
As we now prepare
For the revolution
Slaying all the evil down below
Onwards we ride now
To what we know
Strong enough to stay
And carry on forever
Brace your soul
To fight whenever
In a time of fire we're searching
Blind inside the mind
Run away to hell's damnation
One day we will find
Suddenly the skies are falling
Too late for us all
Crashing down on all creation
As the towers fall
Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind
For the souls lost in endless time

Stand Before the worlds of freedom
Rise above them all
Ride towards the battle raging
Victory behold
Blackened Steel of death tonight
Our legions now descend
Far Beyond the gates of glory
Time to rise again

Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind
Take you with me, we will fly across the sea
To the land of the sun where our journeys begun
All fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
Deepest fears will burn inside your mind
For the souls lost in endless time
For the souls lost in endless time
For the souls lost in endless timeEmbed
