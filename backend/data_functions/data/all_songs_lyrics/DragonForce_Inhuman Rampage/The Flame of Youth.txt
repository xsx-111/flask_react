The Flame of Youth LyricsClose your eyes hear the thunder and rain
Fear inside of the torturing pain
For the cries of the world and the last lives remain
Chain your heart swear to die for their gain
Deep inside slowly fading away
And the last breathe remains and the fear turns to rage
Locked in a world by the fallen evil souls
Torn right apart for your life insane
Burning in my mind now to bring my life to hold
Reach out and die in the flames
See through the lies and their ever staring eyes
Now is the time to defend your ground
Destiny will call to remind us all now
Fly free so far from here
This life we know will end
In dreams of everlasting pain
The fallen now rise again
Through the fire, through the flames
Like the sun will rise again
Lost in time
Lost in space
To the end of all their days
See their endless ways insanity
The quest deranged not meant to be
In flames will now forever burn eternally

So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold of winter skies escape the pain inside
Now feel your soul lost in seas of all eternity
Everyday this life, defending and the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain
So alone in the world far away
Memories of a dream will remain
As the world's falling cold and our lives all in vain
Fire in my soul will forever rise again
Nothing in my mind to remember now
Broken by the fear of the dark night calling
Ride free on endless seas
The final curtain falls
Cut the ground from down below
The time to lock and to load
Through the fire, through the rain
Far across the distant plains
Feel the wind beneath the steel
As your mind becomes insane
Save the pain from all humanity
Their rides trough our destiny
For freedom now we rise for all again


So free your heart leave your life far behind
In the cold of winter skies escape the pain inside
And when the memories are all but left behind
And the days have gone forever, lost within my mind
Now feel your soul burn in seas of all eternity
Every day of this life defending and the flames of youth not ending
In a lifetime searching we must fight through the eternal pain
We fight through the eternal painEmbed
