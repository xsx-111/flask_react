Trails of Broken Hearts LyricsHere we are far beyond the distant sky
Seen all the world and how the story will be over
Through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed
Now we have found the light that guides us over
Through the fallen rain we travelled far and wide
And through the blackest darkness
Stars above shining bright
Through the sun and winter rain will fall
All our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call
We're walking hand in hand in dreams and endless time
How do we know when we will leave this life behind?
Stare at life through eyes of mine
The hate the fear and the pain
There's a feeling held deep inside - when life you live is in vain

Fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
We close your eyes to see the light of brighter days
And all alone we'll be where time can never heal
With the trail of broken hearts flying free
Once again we walk this lonely road
There are times that we are wading through the rain and cold
We're lost in memories of what we left behind
Relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside
Lives are filled with emptiness
The fear returned once again
Searching endlessly you cannot see
Drown your mind in the pain

The last temptation will be all that's left for me
When I see those tears you cry
When I hear those lies you lie
When I see your creation now falling down on me
Is this the reason to be?
