Balloons Lyrics
There's a thing called
There's this thing called
We fly balloons on this fuel called
We fly balloons on this fuel called love
Why don't you take a chair?
What's a fuel called?
Fair weather storms are in your head
Fair weather storms are in your head

We fly balloons on this fuel called love
We fly balloons on this fuel called love
We fly balloons on this fuel called
We fly balloons on this fuel called love

There's a thing called
There's a thing called
There's a thing called
There's a thing called
There's a thing called
There's a thing called
There's a thing called
There's a thing called
We fly balloons on this fuel called love
We fly balloons on this fuel called love
We fly balloons on this fuel called
We fly balloons on this fuel called love
We fly balloons on this fuel called love
We fly balloons on this fuel called love
We fly balloons on this fuel called
We fly balloons on this fuel called love2Embed
