Big Big Love (Fig. 2) Lyrics
See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we fill
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads
See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we fill
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads
See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we fill
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads

Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
And all could be well
See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we fill
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads
A place we can hide

Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no

See how the skulls we build
Fill all the towers we fill
Crash down fury red
There's cracks in our hearts and heads

Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
That could stop it
Your smile sticks a kiss
Your smile sticks a kiss
And all could be well

Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no
Oh, electric shocks, no8Embed
