Tron LyricsAway, away from this system, there is
Another country place we could go
Away, away from this system, there is
Another country place we could go
Away, away from this system, there is
A flower shop by which I mean to say
Away, away from this system, there is
Another country place we could go
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away
If something won't heal, our children can't help you out
If something won't heal, our children can't help you out
If something won't heal, a compass can't help you out
If something won't heal, our children can't help you out
Away, away from this system, there is
A flower shop by which I mean to say
Away, away from this system, there is
Another country place we could go
Away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away, away
Waste is a waste!
Waste is a waste!
Waste is a, waste is a, waste is a waste!
Waste is a waste!
Waste is a waste!
Waste is a, waste is, waste is a waste!
Waste is a waste!
Waste is a waste!
Waste is a, waste is, waste is a waste!
If something won't heal, our children can't help us out
If something won't heal, our children can't help us out
If something won't heal, a compass can't help you out
This love is foreign, why don't you quieten down?2Embed
