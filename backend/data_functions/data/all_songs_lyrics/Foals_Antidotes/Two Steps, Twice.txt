Two Steps, Twice Lyrics
Sun side, sun, a dance step for two
Sun side, a dance step for two
Sun side, a dance step for two
Sun side, a dance step for two
Sun side, a dance step for two
(Dance upon and learn to swim
Dance upon and learn to swim)
Sun side, a dance step for two
(Dance upon and learn to swim
Dance upon and learn to swim)
Sun side, a dance step for two
(Dance upon and learn to swim
Dance upon and learn to swim)
Sun side, a dance step for two
(Dance upon and learn to swim
Dance upon and learn to swim)

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba

Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba
Ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba-da, ba-ba
(Woo!) That's one step, one step, two step
That's two steps, two steps, speed bikes
That's one step, one step, two step
That's two step, dance step, speed bikes
That's one side, one side, one side
That's one side, two steps, speed bikes
Let's swim, let's swim, let's swim this off
Let's swim, let's swim, let's swim this off


That's two step, two step, one step
That's one step, two step, dance step
That's two step, dance step, speed bikes
Let's swim, let's swim, let's swim this off
Let's swim, let's swim, let's swim this off
Let's swim, let's swim, let's swim this off
Let's swim, let's swim, let's swim this off
Let's swim, let's swim, let's swim this off4Embed
