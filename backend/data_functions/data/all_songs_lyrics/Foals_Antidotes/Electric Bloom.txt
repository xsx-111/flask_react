Electric Bloom Lyrics
This is a warning shot
Your final call
An empty morgue with gurning hearts
Hollowed crowns
And all I see is marching bands
Is marching bands
Marching bands, which never rest
In broken stands
Butcher birds with useless throats
With useless throats
We're not safe of dying kings
With plastic knives

It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another

Captains made with metal tags
Flags brought down of hollowed crowns
It's everything without a time
It's just a, it's just a
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another

Goodbye all your marching bands
Laid to rest in broken stands
Butcher birds will fly away
Will fly away, will fly away
This is not a warning call
Your final shot
All I see is butcher birds
Will fly away, electric bloom

It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another, it's just another1Embed
