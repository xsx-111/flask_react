Cassius Lyrics
Cassius, it's over, Cassius away
Cassius, these daydreams, these daydreams, okay
Cassius, an accident, Cassius, an accident
Accident, accident, accident
Cassius, it's over, Cassius, away
Cassius, these daydreams, these daydreams, okay
The lighthouse is an accident, the lighthouse is an accident
Accident, accident, accident

I wish we'd gone, I wish we'd gone away
And what you've got, and what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do, it's all that we could do
The wind is in, the wind is in my heart
The wind is in, now what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do, it's all that we could do

Cassius, it's over, you're second best
Cassius, it's over, you're second best
It's over, you're second best
Second best, second best, second best
Cassius, it's over, Cassius away
Cassius, these daydreams, these daydreams, okay
The lighthouse is an accident, the lighthouse is an accident
Accident, accident, accident
I wish we'd gone, I wish we'd gone away
And what you've got, and what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do, it's all that we could do
The wind is in, the wind is in my heart
The wind is in, now what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do, it's all that we could do

Cassius, it's over, you're second best
Cassius, it's over, you're second best
It's over, you're second best
Second best, second best, second best

I wish we'd gone, I wish we'd gone away
And what you've got, and what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do, it's all that we could do
The wind is in, the wind is in my heart
The wind is in, now what you've got is always gone away
Cassius, Cassius at best
It's all that we could do, it's all that we could do3Embed
