Olympic Airways Lyrics
Sun's up, we wait all day
Sun's up, we wait all day, all day
The hell outside's kept away
If only we could move away from here
This is how we build a place
An aviary for today
An aviary for today
Let's disappear 'til tomorrow
Let's disappear 'til tomorrow

Dis-a-ppe-ar, dis-a-ppe-ar
Dis-a-ppe-ar, -ar, -ar, -ar

Blow up these plane parades, let's go
To an aviary far from home
To an aviary far from home
A one-hand clap is me and you
And you, and you, and you
While the hell outside's kept away
If only we moved away

Dis-a-ppe-ar, dis-a-ppe-ar
Dis-a-ppe-ar, -ar, -ar, -ar
Last vacation was the same
We got moved away
Last vacation was the same
We got moved away
Last vacation was the same
We got moved away

Sun down, now we have built our place
An aviary forever
An aviary forever
Forever, forever

Re-a-ppe-ar, re-a-ppe-ar
Re-a-ppe-ar, re-a-ppe-ar6Embed
