Jesus Saves, I Spend Lyrics
While Jesus is saving, I'm spending all my days
In backgrounds and landscapes with the languages of saints
While people are spinning like toys on Christmas Day
I'm inside a still life with the other absentee

While Jesus is saving, I'm spending all my days
In the garden-grey pallor of lines across your face
While people will cheer on the spectacle we've made
I'm sitting and sculpting menageries of saints

Oh, my man, my absentee
I'd do anything to please you
Come, my love, the stage is waiting
Be the one to save my saving grace

While Jesus is saving, I'm spending all my grace
On the rosy-red pallor of lights on center stage
While people have cheered on the awful mess we've made
Through storms of red roses, we've exited the stage2Embed
