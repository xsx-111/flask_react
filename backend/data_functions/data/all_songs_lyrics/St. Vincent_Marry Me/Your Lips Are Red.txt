Your Lips Are Red Lyrics
Your lips are red
My face is red from reading your red lips
My hands are black
My hands are black inside this downtown taxi cab
This city's red
This city's red from riding us into the ground
This city's black
This city's black from all the ashes in downtown
(Ashes in downtown, ashes in downtown)

My face is drawn
My face is drawn on with this number 2 pencil
Your face is drawn
Your face is drawn from drawing words right from my lips
(Words right from my lips, words right from my lips)

Your lips are red
My face is red from reading your red lips
My hands are red
My hands are red from sealing your red lips
(Sealing your red lips, sealing your red lips)

Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
Your skin's so fair
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
Your skin's so fair
(You remind me)
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
Your skin's so fair
(You remind me)
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
(You remind me)
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
(City graffiti)
Your skin's so fair
(You remind me)
Your skin's so fair, it's not fair
(City graffiti)
Oh
(You remind me)
Your skins so fair, it's not fair
(City graffiti)
Your skin's so fair
(You remind me)
Your skins so fair, it's not fair
(City graffiti)3Embed
