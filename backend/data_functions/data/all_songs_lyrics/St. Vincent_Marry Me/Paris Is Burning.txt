Paris Is Burning Lyrics
I write to give word the war is over
Send my cinders home to mother
They gave me a medal for my valor
Leaden trumpets spit the soot of power

They say, "I'm on your side when nobody is, 'cause nobody is
Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear."

We are waiting on a telegram to give us news of the fall
I am sorry to report, dear Paris is burning after all
We have taken to the streets in open rejoice, revolting
We are dancing a black waltz, fair Paris is burning after all

Oh no

Enclosed in this letter, there's a picture
Black and white for your refrigerator
Sticks and stones have made me smarter
It's words that cut me under my armor

They say, "I'm on your side when nobody is, 'cause nobody is
Come sit right here and sleep while I slip poison in your ear."
We are waiting on a telegram to give us news of the fall
I am sorry to report, dear Paris is burning after all
We have taken to the streets in open rejoice, revolting
We are dancing a black waltz, fair Paris is burning after all

Oh no, ooh

Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris to the ground
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris, ashes now
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris to the ground
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris, ashes now
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris to the ground
Dance, poor people, dance and drown
Dance fair Paris, ashes now1Embed
