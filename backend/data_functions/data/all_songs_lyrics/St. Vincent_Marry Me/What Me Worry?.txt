What Me Worry? Lyrics
What, me worry?
I never do
I'm always amused
And amusing you
Sans le fear of impending doom
Life is like banquet food
Pleasure to peruse

Do I amuse you, dear?
Would you think me queer
If while standing beside you
I opted instead to disappear?
Disappear

In no hurry
I'll sing my tune
All my skies the hue
Of a ruddy bruise
In my finest threads couture
I'll call up my favorite muse
For a drink—half full—or two

Have I abused you, dear?
You have had it to here
You say, "Love is just a blood match to see who endures lash
After lash
With panache."
In the spring, I dust off my lute
Stuff my suitcase full of blues
And I'll stir the dust underneath
The thrust of my clicking heels
C'est la vie

What, me worry?
I never do
Life is one charming ruse
For us lucky few

Have I fooled you, dear?
The time, it's coming near
When I'll give you my hand and I'll say, "It's been grand
But, I'm out of here."
I'm out of here2Embed
