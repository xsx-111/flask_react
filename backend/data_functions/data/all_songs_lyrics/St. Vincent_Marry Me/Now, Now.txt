Now, Now Lyrics
(I'm not) Your mother's favorite dog
(I'm not) The carpet you walk on
(I'm not) One small atomic bomb

(I’m not) Any, any, any, any, any, any
Anything at all

(I'm not) The feather at your feet
(I'm not) Your yellow brick street
(I'm not) Anyone you'll see

(I’m not) Any, any, any, any, any, any, any
Anything

Now, now
Now, now
Now, now
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that)
I'll make you sorry
(I'm not) The pawn to your king
(I'm not) Your world on a string
(I'm not) Anyone you'll beat

(I'm not) Any, any, any, any, any, any, any
Anything
Any, any, any, any, any, any, any
Anything

Now, now
Now, now
Now, now
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that)
I'll make you sorry

(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)
(You don't mean that, say you're sorry)2Embed
