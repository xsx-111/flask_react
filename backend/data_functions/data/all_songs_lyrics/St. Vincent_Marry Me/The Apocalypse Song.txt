The Apocalypse Song Lyrics
Wait, I'll be swifter than the speed of light
Carbon all my body, a billion years of time
You'll wake with the stitches over both your eyes
And deny me my body and all earthly delights

It's time, you are light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of
Time and light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of

All of your praying amounts to just one breath
Please keep your victory, but give me little death

It's time, you are light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of
Time and light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of

Time, time, time, time

Time, you are light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of
Time and light
I guess you are afraid of what everyone is made of
Everyone is made of
So take to the streets with apocalypse refrain
Your devotion has the look of a lunatic's gaze4Embed
