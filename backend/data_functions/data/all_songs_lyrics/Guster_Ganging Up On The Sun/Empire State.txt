Empire State Lyrics
Been the crawl of a mountain
Been a link in a chain
I've been scolded for stealing
I've been told to behave
I've been reading the forecast
Something's coming this way
But it's taking forever
I'm too tired to maintain that
I'm slow

Been a scratch on the surface
Been a clog in the drain
I've been melodramatic
I've been sleeping for days
I've been one in a million
Been a million to one
This is taking forever
Always seems to return that
I'm slow

All hands up, salute the Empire State
Faith be true, you know the way
Ten feet tall in this: an empty space
Fallen walls all around
Destroyed again
Destroyed again
Been digging to China
I've been a fish in the sea
I've been talking to Jesus
But he's not talking to me
I've been reading the forecast
Something's coming this way
But it's taking forever
I'm too tired to maintain that
I'm slow

All hands up, salute the Empire State
Faith is true, she knows the way
Ten miles tall in this: an empty space
Fallen walls all around
We'll build again
Rebuild again

Been the crawl of a mountain
Been a link in a chain
Been scolded for stealing
I've been carted awayEmbed
