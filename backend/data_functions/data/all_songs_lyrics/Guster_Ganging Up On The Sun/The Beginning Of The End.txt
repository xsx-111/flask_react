The Beginning Of The End Lyrics
We're not sentimental
We're just oil-filled machines
Trying not to say the things we mean
You gotta show us a little love

Our big brother tells us
That it's something in our genes
Pretty soon we'll all be coming clean
So start showing a little skin

I'm the judge and jury
I'm the lion and the lamb
And this is the beginning of the end
It's breaking you down
We're breaking you down

We're unrecognizable
We're sunken submarines
Trying to escape before we're seen
You're gonna miss us when we're gone

I'm the judge and jury
I'm the lion and the lamb
And this is the beginning of the end
It's breaking you down
We're breaking you downEmbed
