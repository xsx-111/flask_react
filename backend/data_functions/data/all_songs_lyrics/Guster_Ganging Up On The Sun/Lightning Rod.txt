Lightning Rod Lyrics
Standing on a building, I am a lightning rod
And all these clouds are so familiar
Descending from the mountaintops, the gods are threatening
But I will return an honest soldier

Home

Steady on this high rise, like every lightning rod
And all these clouds are boiling over
Swimming in adrenaline, the sky is caving in
But I will remain the honest soldier
