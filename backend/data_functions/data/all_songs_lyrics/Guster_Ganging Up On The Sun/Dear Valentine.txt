Dear Valentine Lyrics
As I fall asleep, to black and white TV
Fly far away, in my recurring dream
Each winter drains electricity
There are words to say
And there are songs to sing
But I can hardly speak at all

Home, I'm on my way
To a holiday in real time
Float, hold my own weight
Say we'll be ok, dear valentine

Now quietly peek across the street
Perfectly kept, perfectly neat
But it's not complete, no not at all

Home, I'm on my way
To a holiday in real time
Float, hold my own weight
Say we'll be ok, dear valentineEmbed
