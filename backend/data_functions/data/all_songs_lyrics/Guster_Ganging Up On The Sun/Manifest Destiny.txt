Manifest Destiny Lyrics
Bones are broken and the will is sunk
How did everything get so fucked up?
Do you want to change your mind?
You can always change your mind

You and I could quit this scene
Build a town and then secede
Like an Adam and an Eve
'Cause to the dreamers go the dreams
But the leaders have the lead
It's a frightening, frightening thing

Born to the land of opportunity
Of manifest destiny
Do you want to change your mind?
You can always change your mind

You and I could quit this scene
Build a town and then secede
Like an Adam and an Eve
To the dreamers go the dreams
But the leaders have the lead
It's a frightening, frightening thing
The moon and stars are ganging up on the sun
Rebellion!

Everybody, the sky is falling down
Friends and lovers, the world is coming down
Down, down
Down, down1Embed
