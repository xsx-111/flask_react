Aurora Gone Lyrics
All of me that gave unto the fold of a wave
I could not bear to be up under, while knowing all along
My faith would fade away and she'd see me just as I am

I would get home and she would greet me
Sit by the fire 'til the morning comes
Telling of stories, how we could move off
Leave the others, start anew at once

Building our own with those who join us
Celebration, celebration!
Oh this thing will never come to us
The world is done
Aurora gone

Many before me saw the peril
I ignored the error of my ways
Who would defend one void of caring
Looking beyond to start anew at once?

Building our own with those who join us
Celebration, celebration!
Oh this thing will never come to us
The world is unglorious
Aurora goneEmbed
