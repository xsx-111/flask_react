Antiphon Lyrics
Find the poor
All kneeled down before
He who takes and defiles
I want more, I want more

Idols wore
Fine wool at the door
To revile then forsake
Fight a war, fight a war

Antiphon antiphon…
Fight a war, fight a war…

Tried and bore
Blame for all ignored
Head contrived, tongue applied
Nevermore, nevermore

Antiphon antiphon antiphon antiphon…
Antiphon antiphon antiphon antiphon…
I want more than kneel down before
Fight a war, they sit at the door
Nevermore, all to be ignored
To the call, a responseEmbed
