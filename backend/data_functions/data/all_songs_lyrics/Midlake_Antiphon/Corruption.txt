Corruption Lyrics
We went to the Moon
With oil tycoons
Bearing all the fruit
They own that too

Plants run across
Fields fold and toss

Fools were told and fought
By minds that ought
Know what would ensue
For those who flew

Plants run across
Fields fold and toss

Science our daughter
Religion our father
Who is mother?Embed
