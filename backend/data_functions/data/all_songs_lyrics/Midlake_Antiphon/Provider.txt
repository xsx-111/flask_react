Provider Lyrics
When the first among the ground were laid
I wouldn’t fall under the man’s curse
Onward forth into a land unknown
Swords were drawn upon the road

Provider, carry on
Far from the golden age
Follow me down a fox hole in the ground
Don’t delay
Come morning, miles along
Gathered round, those remained
With bird in hand and I cried for the land
Joy to gain

Winter came and I was old and alone
Time say it’s gone under the man’s curse
Onward forth onto a land unknown
With only hope of the sea’s ago

Provider, carry on
Far from the golden age
Follow me down a fox hole in the ground
Don’t delay
Provider, carry on
Far from the golden age
Follow me down a fox hole in the ground
Don’t delay
Come morning, miles along
Gathered round, those remained
With bird in hand and I cried for the land
Joy to gainEmbed
