Ages Lyrics
Seal
Your rolling tongue
Freeze
Howling lungs

Shaking in your shoes
You thought only
I won't go
Where's mine
They won't last ages

Seal
Your rolling tongue
Freeze
Howling lungs

Shaking in your shoes
You thought only
I won't go
Where's mine
They won't last ages
Seal
Your rolling tongue
Howling lungs
Your rolling tongueEmbed
