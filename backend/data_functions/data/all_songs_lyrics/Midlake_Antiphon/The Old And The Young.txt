The Old And The Young Lyrics
Time will have warranted all that the foliage brung
Falls to the ground at the feet of the old and the young
Tired and worn from a life made of wallow and pain
Of what will be made is all that remains at the core

Bear the old and the young
Time will have warranted
All that the foliage brung
So bear the old and the young

Awoke from a long one that came on the heels of a day
Where sun would arise and then grant us the kindness of ray
Fields full of gladness surrounded by droves that await
And look for the grave in everything adorn

Bear the old and the young
Time will have warranted
All that the foliage brung
So bear the old and the young
Bear the old and the young
Time will have warranted
All that the foliage brung
Bear the old and the young
Time will have warranted
All that the foliage brung
So bear the old and the youngEmbed
