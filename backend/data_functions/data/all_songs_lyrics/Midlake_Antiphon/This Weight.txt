This Weight Lyrics
I'm not fooling anyone but me
I don't love anyone but me

Though many obey only
I will go no further, oh I'll leave

While it all comes closing in slowly
My mind fears what's to come or be
For years now this weight carried
I don't love anyone

Though many give all to be nothing
I will go no further, oh I'll leave
And when this weight falls on me
I will go no further, oh I'll leaveEmbed
