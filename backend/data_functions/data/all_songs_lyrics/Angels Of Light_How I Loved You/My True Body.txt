My True Body Lyrics
Now I am your mute cousin
Young shaved virgin whore
On my prison steel bed I wait for you
So follow me down
I am weeping and torn
Put your dirty white hands inside me
These walls they are ringing
With my tortured lust screaming
Now suck the fear from my belly
The red sea is raging
With my coughing and spitting
My love is bitter sulphur burning
Now I am your mute wife
You wrote your name on my back with your knife
My pain is pointless and endless
I'm your stupid child now
Who is shaking with grief in your mouth
And I'm calling your name from hell

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na

The shining black horse on the ridge
Is snorting and choking with it
I can feel the texture of your suffering
My memory's an ocean
Littered with useless debris
Please stop me now from thinking
The white sun is rising
Over the lavender hill
I can see the footsteps of Jesus
So where's my true body now
Now that I've been consumed?
I'm dissolving inside your future!
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na
No I am not my bodyEmbed
