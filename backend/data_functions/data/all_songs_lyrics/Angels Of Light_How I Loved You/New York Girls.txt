New York Girls Lyrics
New York Girls
Scattered crimson pearls
You touch me like you do
You fall in love with fools
I saw you in the night
Your silver rings they shined
The music was too loud
I kneeled and kissed the crowd
New York Girls
The crimson liquid folds
New York Girls
Please give me what you hold on to

I'm sorry that I failed
I'm sorry for the past
I'm sorry that I touched
The place that you protected
New York Girls
I'll watch you from afar
New York Girls
I'll worship what you are
New York Girls
I'm happy that I saw
New York Girls
How cruel and pure you are
New York Girls
The scent of your incense
New York Girls
Is drifting through my head...
Run through the city
Come to me
Run through the forest
Come back to me
Run from fear, run from fear...
Come back, come back...

Don't do that...Embed
