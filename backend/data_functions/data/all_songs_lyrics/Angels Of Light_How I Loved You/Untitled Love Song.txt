Untitled Love Song Lyrics
Free from your past
Free of your future too
There's nothing left to rise above but you
Show me your ocean red
Kiss the tears that stain my neck
Drug me with visions untrue
But I own a photograph
You lay there naked upon your back
Safe in a stone house by the sea
There's nothing true and nothing's real
But I remember one clear feel
Warm beneath your gentle company
While I lay dying upon some bed
I hope that you remember this
The only one I want to see is you

La la la la la la, la la la la la la
La la, la la la la la la
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na, na na na na na1Embed
