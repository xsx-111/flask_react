Two Women Lyrics

And I, I wrote a poem
On your porcelain white back
And you, you cut the cord in me
And you, you wore the mask
Painted red, with golden cross
And in your hands of glitter blue
You hold the knife that cuts the sun
The polished knife, it cuts me too
And I'm nailed onto your shadow
And I thank you for my birth
I hear your voice, like silver crystals
Raining tears upon these words
And I, I remember
I remember who you were
I saw you standing in the ruins
Cut from white stone and yellow earth

Then you come for me
Then you come for me
Then you come for me
Then you come
Through the hills of iron
Through the leaves of rust
Through the turning white mist
Through the steel wire and underbrush
Through the lines that mark your face
Through the living joy that I erased
Beneath the pools of shining glass
Beneath the water and through the past
You come for me
Then you come for me
You put your eyes in my head
You put your voice in my mouth
You put your mind in my mind
You put your blood in my blood
You put your hand into my side
You put your lips onto my skin

Will you come for me?
Will you come for me?
Will you come?
Will you come?
Will you come?
Will you come?
Mmm
And the fire will burn my eyes out
But the truth will refuse to leave my mouth
And the water will run thick black
And this planet will rupture and crack
And you people will whisper with her name
And your children will curl up in the flames
And her fingers will touch the empty space
And the starlight will shine behind her face
And her body will show the secret heat
And the ocean will gather at her feet
And her two arms will hold the life I lost
But her blue eyes will nullify the costâ€”
Of attrition, self-hate and inner rage
Running down my face and through my veins
I'll kneel naked upon the burning coals
I'll steal the diamond that flashes in your soul

If you'll come for me
Will you come for me?
Will you come for me?
Will you come for me?

And we'll rise above
Yeah, we'll rise above
We'll rise above
We will rise above
We will rise above
We will rise above
We will rise and rise and rise and rise
We will rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
Rise and rise and rise and rise
Rise and rise and rise and rise
Rise and rise and rise and rise
Rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We will rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
We'll rise and rise and rise and rise
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
