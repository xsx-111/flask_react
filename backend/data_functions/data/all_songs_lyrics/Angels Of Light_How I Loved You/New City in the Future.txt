New City in the Future Lyrics
Here, here it is
The place where you lived
The place where you rose
Transparent, a ghost

You were mine, you were mine

Here, here's where you walked
Different now, moonlight and chalk
Polished white stone
Bruised feet, shattered bone
Brittle hand of a child

You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine

Raise, raise me up
Up from the ground
Naked, transposed
Wound like a rose
Face painted with white
Mouth full of black stone
You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine (Why? Why?)
Mine, mine (Why? Why?)
Mine, mine (Why? Why?)
Mine, mine (Why? Why?)
Mine (Why?)
You were mine

Here, here it is
Look at it shine
Pure, polished and white
Piercing the sky
New towers of ice
So lifeless and clean

You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mine
You were mine, you were mineEmbed
