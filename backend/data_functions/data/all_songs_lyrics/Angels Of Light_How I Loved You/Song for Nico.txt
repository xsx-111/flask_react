Song for Nico Lyrics
One, two, three, four

There lies a strange joy
In my thought's embrace
I'm selfish, contage me the meaning
Of your shallow taste
Paradise is glowing
In your milky sea

Mother, come, come for me

The red velvet scar
On your white inner thigh
Shows the beautiful colors
Of the scars in your mind
But I am the reason
Your legs are apart

Mother, come into my heart

Your voice is the steel blade
Dissecting my cloud
This song is my prayer
To the shape of your mouth
You are the reason
I've stayed on this earth
Mother, sing me into my birthEmbed
