Do You Know Lyrics
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know

Do you know
I think about the time we were together and
I thought that I would call you but I never could do it
I don't get into begging
To make you want me back, yeah
It's my pride

Do you know
Sometimes it's like I never even knew you
I'll be feeling good cause my head, is sinking clearly
But all it takes it's just a second
And there you are
In front of me
(Do you know) do you know
(Do you know) do you know
(Do you know)
(Do you know)
(Do you know) do you know
(Do you know) do you know
(Do you know)

Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know
I think I'll be fine if you met someone
It's not even like we were doing nothing, no
I just need to find something that will take me back to, how, I was before

Do you know
This silent treatment doesn't stop me bugging
Best thing we can do is really talk about it
I was never tryin' be cold but I'm sure you knew I could be without you

Be alone (do you know)
Do you know
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Do you know
Do you know
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Be alone
Do you knowEmbed
