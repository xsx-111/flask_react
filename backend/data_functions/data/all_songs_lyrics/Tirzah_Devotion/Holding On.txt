Holding On Lyrics
I'm not shy to say, even when it's wrong
But what's keepin' me from holdin' on?
I'll be thinkin' of you even when you're gone
But what's keepin' me from holdin' on?

There's no shame in letting go
Feels the same to hold on
Maybe it's stupid, I know myself
But I'm hoping
'Cause I want nothing else
Don't wanna change
And don't wanna change what you do to me

I'm not shy to say, even when it's wrong
But what's keepin' me from holdin' on?
I'll be thinkin' of you even when you're gone
But what's keepin' me from holdin' on?

This feeling's controlling me, I can't shut it down
No point tellin' me I can only have sound
I wanna love you, where is my frown?
Don't wanna hold on to you if you're happy alone
But if you're thinkin' about me
Tell me, 'cause I'm right here all alone
I'm not shy to say, even when it's wrong
But what's keepin' me from holdin' on?
I'll be thinkin' of you even when you're gone
But what's keepin' me from holdin' on?


I'm not shy to say, even when it's wrong
But what's keepin' me from holdin' on?
I'll be thinkin' of you even when you're gone
But what's keepin' me from holdin' on?2Embed
