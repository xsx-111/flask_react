Say When LyricsIt's been so long
I felt you gone
And now I'm lost
Say you wanna try and make me feel better
But that ain't say what you really mean
Say that you feel estranged
And I go on like nothing's changed and
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Say you don't know if you see this as forever
Why did I let it go on so long?
You say you couldn't change
The way you felt about my mistakes
Yeah-yeah
Feels like you're makin' fun of me, yeah
But I know you wouldn't mean to be that cruel
But I know you
Say when you know
Say when you know
Say when you know
Say when you know
It's not about who's right or who's wrong
It's not about tryin' to be clever
I come to you, I come to you with an open heart
'Cause the last thing I want to do is be apart from you, yeah
Since so long
I felt you gone
And now I'm lost
Now I'm lost, yeah
I'm only tryin' to be real
Don't reject the way I feel
I'm only tryin' to be real
Don't reject the way I feel
Play it through, all of you, fed you on
I'm only tryin' to be real
Don't reject the way I feel
Play it through, all of you, fed you on1Embed
