Devotion Lyrics
So listen to me, so listen to me
So listen to me, so listen to me
So listen to me, so listen to me
So listen to me, so listen to me
So listen to me, so listen to me
So listen to me, so listen to me
So listen to me, so listen to me
So listen to me, so listen to me

I just want your attention
(So listen to me)
I just want you to listen
(Listen to me)
I don't want the solution
I just want to explain things
I'm not looking for reactions
I'm not looking for acceptance
You can come to me with honesty
(Listen to me)
You can come to me with tenderness
Yeah

Yeah I want your arms
Your kisses, your devotion
(So listen to me)
Yeah I want your arms
(So listen to me, so listen to me, yeah)
Your kisses, your devotion
(Listen to me)
Yeah
I want candlelight and romantic notion
Yeah (yeah)
I want your hands around me and understanding
Yeah
So listen to me (x2)

You can come to me with all your charms
(So listen to me)
You can come to me with those eyes
(So listen to me)
Yeah I'll come to you with all my heart
(So listen to me)
I won't make it hard for you to see
(So listen to me)
I just want you to be true to me
(So...)
I need all your attention
(Yeah, ohhhh)
Sometimes I think that's all I need
But most of all I want your comfort for me
But most of all I want your comfort for me
Yeah
Yeah I want your arms
(Oooo)
Your kisses, your devotion
(Oooo)
Yeah I want your arms
Your kisses, your devotion
Yeah

So listen to me... (x4)1Embed
