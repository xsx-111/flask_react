Gladly Lyrics
All I know I got to be
With you, no reason not to be
Next to you, you next to me
Holding you and you're holding me
Time again, I want to see
The way you look at me
I could be away from here
With no one, just you

All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly

I don't want
To sound so serious
But you are taking me away from all this hate
All it takes, all it takes
Is your arms, your smile
I like you
You're like to me
Closer than I've ever been
I want you around me
Always, always
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly
All I want is you
I love you
Gladly, gladly, gladly

Feels like it's raining, super soak
Feels like it's raining, super soak
Feels like it's raining, super soak
Feels like it's raining, super soak

All I want is youEmbed
