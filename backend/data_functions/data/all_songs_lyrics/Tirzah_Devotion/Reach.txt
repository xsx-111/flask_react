To reach high
Time goes
Move so fast
Your clothes move so slow
You got dreams and I
Want you to reach high
I know we are made from
Love and fantasy
I know
We will be here for eternity
Time goes
Move so fast
Your clothes
We move so slow
You got dreams and I
Want you to reach high (Reach high)
To reach high (Reach high)
To reach high (Reach high)
To reach high (Reach high)
From love and fantasyEmbed
