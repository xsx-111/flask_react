Fine Again Lyrics
I'll make you fine again
I'll make you
Yeah, I'll make you fine again
I'll make you fine
I'll make you fine
I'll make you fine
Again, again

Don't wait for me
I'll be here
This is so pure this is rare
I just want you to know that I'm here for you
You make me stronger so I'm here to get you
Don't worry about worries, I won't let them get you, you

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah1Embed
