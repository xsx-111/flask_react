Guilty LyricsDid I let you feel the blame when I should have been faithful?
Did I let you take the blame when I should have been faithful?
Did I let you take the blame?
Did I let you take the blame?
Did I make you feel cold when I left you outside?
Yeah
When I left you outside, when I left you outside
When I left you outside, yeah
When I left you outside, when I left you outside
When I left you outside, did I make you feel cold?
When I left you outside, did I make you feel
Get you, when I make you feel
Lies, did I make you feel guilty when I met you down rise
Did I make you feel cold when I left you outside?
Did I make you walk by did I make you lope down
Did I make you rope in
