Go Now Lyrics
Somethin's happened that I'm missin'
And it's takin' over me
'Cause you're not home so early
Thinkin' you've been fuckin' with me

Don't raise your voice to me
Don't raise your voice to me

And you're going out with them boys
Makin' money I don't see
I don't see, I don't, don't
Still I'm thinkin' what you're thinkin'
Ain't good enough for me
Good enough for me

Don't raise your voice to me
Don't raise your voice, don't raise your voice
(Don't raise your voice to me, yeah)
Don't raise your voice to me, yeah
Don't raise your voice, don't raise your voice to me
Don't raise your voice, don't raise your voice to me
Don't raise your voice, don't raise your voice to me
I don't see, I don't see, yeah
(Don't raise your voice to me, yeah)
So I'm thinking what you're thinking for me, good enough for me
(Don't raise your voice to me, yeah)
(Don't raise your voice to me, yeah)
(Don't raise your voice to me, yeah)Embed
