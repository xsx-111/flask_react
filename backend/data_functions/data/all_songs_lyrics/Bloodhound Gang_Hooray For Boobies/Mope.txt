Mope Lyrics
We gonna drop this next bomb for a money makin' playa that ain't with us no mo'
Yeah, Notorious B.I.G.!
Hell no, we gonna do this for a gangbanging thug that never seen it comin'
Yeah, 2Pac Shakur!
Nah, bitch, I'm talkin' 'bout motherfuckin' Falco and shit
What? Falco?
Ooh, rock me, Amadeus
Ooh, rock me, Amadeus
Ooh, rock me, Amadeus
Ooh, rock me, Amadeus
Ooh, rock me, Amadeus
Ooh, rock me, Amadeus
Ooh, rock me, Amadeus
Ooh, rock me, Amadeus

Tried to O.D. on the Cold-Eeze
Golden Girls got me sweatin' to the oldies
Hanging out like double-Ds, sip Long Island Iced Teas
Wrote to Mayor McCheese, "Send a Shamrock Shake, please!"
Three o' clock on the dot, time to cruise for eighth graders
Rather tape the Weather Channel so that I can watch it later
Reruns of Rerun! So, what's happening?
Dee's knocked up and Rog's on crack again
Deepthroat a whole Nutty Buddy
Make whoopie to a batch of Silly Putty
Made a Spam and Colgate sandwich and ate it
Go through National Geographic and draw panties on the natives
So I like to dance naked in front of my pets
But my cat was inattentive, so I sent him UPS
Playing spin the bottle with my mom
I watch COPS with no pants on
Must've blown a fuse, nothing's going on
Lamer than the Pope, climb the walls like King Kong
Buggin' out like Tori Spelling's eyes
Deader than the parents on A Party of Five
Luciano Pavarotti on a treadmill
Not going nowhere, slim chance we will
Less hip than Bo Jackson, bored like wood
Dick around like Frankie Goes to Hollywood

Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum

Nowhere to go, I can't wake up late
Just sit around and wait for my Old Spice to activate
Stalemate jail-bait in my so-called-life imprisonment
Amazing what a good breakfast pickles make, isn't it?
I like to pretend I'm speed reading
Never lose the sight of the thrill of sneezing
Don't need a shower today, just some Brut by Faberge
Smell the ass of my jeans--clean, they'll do another day
And I recycle; I sniff my own farts
I dial the wrong number, hope a conversation starts
I mean, I might as well be listening to Journey
Givin' myself a mullet, hook the Flowbee to the Kirby
Make a prank call pretending I'm a mime
Get stuck in traffic just to pass the time
Sent a letter in the mail, in Braille, to Jonny Quest
"Send me back my Etch-A-Sketch!"
Must've blown a fuse, nothing's going on
Lamer than the Pope, climb the walls like King Kong
Buggin' out like Tori Spelling's eyes
Deader than the parents on A Party of Five
Luciano Pavarotti on a treadmill
Not going nowhere, slim chance we will
Less hip than Bo Jackson, bored like wood
Dick around like Frankie Goes To Hollywood

Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum

I'm mighty tighty whitey and I'm smugglin' plums
When you wanna cum
I'm mighty tighty whitey and I'm smugglin' plums
When you wanna cum
I'm mighty tighty whitey and I'm smugglin' plums
When you wanna cum
I'm mighty tighty whitey and I'm smugglin' plums
When you wanna cum
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! What it is, motherfuckers?
Aw shit, here comes Pac-Man
Hey Pac-Man, what's up?
Me, you bitches, I'm high on crack! Wanna freebase?
No, Pac-Man, drugs are bad!
Nope, can't help you, mane
Pussies! Whoa! Holy shit!

Must've blown a fuse, nothing's going on
Lamer than the Pope, climb the walls like King Kong
Buggin' out like Tori Spelling's eyes
Deader than the parents on A Party of Five
Luciano Pavarotti on a treadmill
Not going nowhere, slim chance we will
Less hip than Bo Jackson, bored like wood
Dick around like Frankie Goes To Hollywood

Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna go to it
Relax, don't do it, when you wanna cum
Holy macaroni
Holy macaroni
