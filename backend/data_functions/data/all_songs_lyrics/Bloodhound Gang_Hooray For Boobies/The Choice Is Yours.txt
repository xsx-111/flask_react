The Choice Is Yours Lyrics
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
Here they come

Who's the black sheep? What's the black sheep?
Don't know who I am or when I'm comin' so you sleep
Wasn't in my room, wasn't in my sphere
Knew not who I was but listen here
Therefore, I ignore, I do as I feel inside
I live with me, I got my back tonight
Can I hear a "Hey?" Hey! Can I get a "Yo?" Yo!
You got a hat? Huh? It's for the hoes. Oh
Stylin' is creative, black sheep of the native
Can't be violated or even decepticated
I got brothers in the jungle, cousins on the quest
Deaf retarded uncles getting parties in their ass
Now you can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this for this is kind of phat
If you can get with that, then you will surely miss
For that is so wack, get with this

You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this for this is where it's at (at, at)
Engine Engine Number Nine
On the New York transit line
If my train jumps off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up (c'mon)
Engine Engine Number Nine
On the New York transit line
If my train jumps off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up (woo)

Where's the black sheep? Here's the black sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Open the door, you best believe
We're sliding through it swiftly
Niftily, we can make it hip to be
What we are 'cause what we be
The epitome doo dah dippity
Any time capacity was filled, tried to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool so we finished school
Never see us sweat and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later, by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
You can get with this or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this for this is where it's at

Engine Engine Number Nine
On the New York transit line
If my train jumps off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up (c'mon)
Engine Engine Number Nine
On the New York transit line
If my train jumps off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up (woo)

Engine Engine Number Nine
On the New York transit line
If my train jumps off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up (c'mon)
Engine Engine Number Nine
On the New York transit line
If my train jumps off the track
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up (woo)Embed
