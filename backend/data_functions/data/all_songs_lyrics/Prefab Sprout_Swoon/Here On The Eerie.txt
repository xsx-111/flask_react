Here On The Eerie LyricsIt's much more beguiling, than children at play
The mind meets dilemma, with a heart in decay
How they reconcile art with... What was I going to say?
I called because you're in a position to help
With a limited talent, but impossible wealth
How they reconcile love with...
It sure is a problem... But don't go away
Cool critique of new Gomorrah, or schoolboy crush on Che Guevara
Face yourself or... Give it away
Hearts grow numb and consience weary, mutiny here on the Eerie
Face yourself or... Give it away
Don't start pretending, you've feelings of anguish
If you'd prefer to dance
Please stop talking, of things you know nothing
The truth well will make you ill
So chew on the safest, the blandest of food
And avoid the specifics, that might ruin the mood
A universal prescription... continues to elude
Love becomes you, a happy burden
But other lives stay neatly curtained
Recognize that, It won't go away
Hearts grow numb, and conscience weary, mutiny here on the Eerie
Face yourself or... give it away
This star crossed lovers business, astrologeewhizzness
Go rhyme your runes in June
Don't turn tearful, or mystical on me, I'm not your seventh sonEmbed
