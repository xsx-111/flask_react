Elegance LyricsThere are those who own, the world around your own
And say you want to swan? One to one: Hey kid, they own the pond
There are those who rest, and those who make the beds
And should you seek redress, can't you guess? Hey child, they own this mess
So if these stardust memories fail to please
If you confuse this dinner dance with elegance
If you suffer lack of due respect
Take comfort from the guessing game aspect
That she is least where you expect
Please be ashamed that you're afraid
Equating elegance and real estate
When all the bullion in the world
Cannot transform what's simply second rate
But will yea no come assess me (boastfully)
I'll not be bought by your silver-plated contumely
So don't you do come try me
Because these star-dust memories, fail to please
They're not alike this dinner dance, this elegance
And if you want to swan, one to one: kid you don't need the pond
There are those whose time, is due for steep decline
If you can't find the spot, where their time stops
Just ask who built the clocksEmbed
