Green Isaac LyricsStella Mater, light is failing
Making such a fool of thee
When you'd love to be someone...
This is the time, I've set aside
From selling old rope
And telling bad jokes
And cul de sac pride
I've learnt today, while falling apart
The most eloquent way
To speak or to pray
Is straight from the heart
Oh but to shine like Joan of Arc
You must be prepared to burn
Forget the style and choose from twelve notes
In itself it's a joy
Whether it soothes or annoys
A song starts in the throat
Take two kinds of look, and one wedding day
Now isn't it clear
There's nothing they'll hear
That you'd want to say
And if you've no new clothes to wear
Then simply wash and comb you hair
And little green Isaac, you're gonna walk backwards through the room
Does that mean I won't see you?
It means you're gonna walk backwards through the room
And little green Isaac, I hear you're still wet behind the ears
Isaac's a soft name, it sounds like a pocketful of rain
Well up that stairway he rose, and down that stairway he goes
And little green Isaac, you're gonna walk backwards through the room
Does that mean I won't see you?
It means you're gonna walk backwards through the room
And little green Isaac, I hear you're still wet behind the ears
Isaac's a soft name, it sounds like a pocketful of rain
Well up that stairway he rose, and down that stairway he goes
