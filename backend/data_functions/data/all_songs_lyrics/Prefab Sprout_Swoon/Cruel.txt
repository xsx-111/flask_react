Cruel LyricsCruel is the gospel that sets us all free, then takes you away from me
There is no Chicago urban blues
More heartfelt than my lament for you
I'm a liberal guy, too cool for the macho ache
With a secret tooth, for the cherry on the cake
With a pious smile, a smile that changes what I say
While I waste my time, in regretting that the days
Went from perfect to just O.K
Lordy, What would I do?
Don't call me possessive, but God if he's smoochin' with you
I's a jealous boy root;
The world should be free, but don't you go following suit
My heart is aligned;
It couldn't be neutral, I couldn't be that way inclined
It's hard to defend
Ba ba ba, ba, ba ba, these feelings my tuppentup friend
It's cruel, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba
It's cruel, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba
It's cruel, it's crueler than cruel
But cruel is the gospel that sets us all free, then takes you away from me
Should a love be tender, and bleed out loud?
Or be tougher than tough, and prouder than proud
If I'm troubled by every folding of your skirt
Am I guilty of every male inflicted hurt?
But I don't know how to describe the Modern Rose
When I can't refer to her shape against her clothes
With the fever of purple prose
Lordy, What would I do?
Don't call me possessive, but God if he's smoochin' with you
I's a jealous boy root;
The world should be free, but don't you go following suit
My heart is aligned;
It couldn't be neutral, I couldn't be that way inclined
It's hard to defend
Ba ba ba, ba, ba ba, these feelings my tuppentup friend
It's cruel, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba
It's cruel, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba
It's cruel, it's crueler than cruel
But cruel is the gospel that sets us all free
Then takes you away from me
Cruel is the gospel that sets us all free
Then takes you away from me
