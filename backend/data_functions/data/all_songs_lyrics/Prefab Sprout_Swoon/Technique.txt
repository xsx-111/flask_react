Technique Lyrics12345/12345... 12345/12345
Her husband works in Jodrell Bank, he's home late in the morning
Had he been a lawyer, he wouldn't work for pennies
In the morning I go walking, it helps the hurting soften
I've seen a lot of places, 'cos I miss her very often
But I could never work there, what a shame that I'm not clever
It's for men with horn rimmed glasses, and four distinguished "A Level" passes
What chance so long ago, I buried something I should know
What chance so long ago, I buried something I should know
Verse and chapter they unfurl, - and sprinkle it upon the world. Name it
Technique !
Their eyes don't fill with wonder when you speak
And I loathe the stilted way you make me speak
Without recourse to lying distortion or cheating
Technique !
Their eyes don't fill with wonder when you speak
And I loathe the stilted way you make me speakEmbed
