I Never Play Basketball Now LyricsI'm not looking to disturb you
Just a little to unnerve you
I have no thing about games and always looking back
After that last, unholy row
I never, ever play basketball now
It joins a list of things I'll miss
Like fencing foils and lovely girls I'll never kiss
Leave it behind on an overcrowded desk where the in-tray's
Higher than the out ever will be
Before the tea rooms filled with flirting couples call
Remember to call
And flow, it skips like a river, and it rolls
Flow, you'll swear it's a chapel - isn't that so?
Think of all the things that grew here
Long before we moved here
All of it good and strong, and all of it gone
After that last unholy row
I never, ever play, basketball now
It joins a list of things I'll miss like fencing foils
And lovely girls I'll never kiss
You may say I've got plenty
But no one knows how long things stay big, Roger DEmbed
