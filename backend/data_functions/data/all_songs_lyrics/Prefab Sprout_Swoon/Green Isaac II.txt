Green Isaac II LyricsIt's hard to act so simply
It's easy to make noise
I worship the silence that sings like a bird
I long for the moon as it looks from the earth
But to have and to hold it I'd only suggest
Suggest...
You take one step, Green Isaac, one step away
Suggest...
You take one step, Green Isaac, one step away
Stella mater
Light is failing
Making such a fool of thee
When you'd love to be someoneEmbed
