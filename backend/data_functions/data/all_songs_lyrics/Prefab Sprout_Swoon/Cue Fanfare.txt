Cue Fanfare LyricsSome expressions take me back
Like hair of gold and sweet mary
And running to me
The sweet sweet songs that cloud your eyes - nostalgia supplies
Loredo highstreet buried me - beneath an oak tree
As this is to me, then so to you is something else
That keeps you up long past your bedtime, tearing hair
The sweetest moment comes at last - the waitings over
In shock they stare and cue fanfare
When Bobby Fischer's plane (plane plane)
Touches the ground (plane plane)
He'll take those Russian boys and play them out of town
The sweetest moment comes at last - the waitings over
In shock they stare and cue fanfare
When Bobby Fischer's plane (plane plane)
Touches the ground (plane plane)
He'll take those Russian boys and play them out of town
Playing for blood, as grandmasters should
Some obsessions take me back
Like hair of gold and sweet mary
And running to me
The sweet sweet songs that cloud your eyes - nostalgia supplies
Loredo highstreet buried me - beneath an oak tree
When Bobby Fischer's plane (plane plane)
Touches the ground (plane plane)
He'll take those Russian boys and play them out of town
The sweetest moment comes at last - the waitings over
In shock they stare and cue fanfare
When Bobby Fischer's plane (plane plane)
Touches the ground (plane plane)
He'll take those Russian boys and play them out of town
Playing for blood, as grandmasters shouldEmbed
