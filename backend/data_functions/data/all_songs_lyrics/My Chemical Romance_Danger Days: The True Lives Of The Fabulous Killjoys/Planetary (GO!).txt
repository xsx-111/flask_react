Planetary (GO!) Lyrics
There might be something outside your window
But you'll just never know
There could be something right past the turnpike gates
But you'll just never know

If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
And if their heaven ain't got a vacancy
Then we just, then we just, then we just, then we just
Get up and go!

Ladies and gentlemen, truth is now acceptable
Fame is now injectable, process the progress
This core is critical, faith is unavailable
Lives become incredible, now, please understand that
I can't slow down, I won't be waiting for you
I can't stop now, because I'm dancing
This planet's ours to defend, ain't got no time to pretend
Don't fuck around, this is our last chance

If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
'Cause the emergency room got no vacancy
And we just, and we just, and we just, and we just
Get up and go!
Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Kill the party with me
And never go home
Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home

You're unbelievable, ah, so unbelievable
Ah, you ruin everything, oh, you better go home
I'm unbelievable, yeah, I'm undefeatable
Yeah, let's ruin everything, blast it to the back row
They sell presentable, young, and so ingestible
Sterile and collectible, safe, and I can't stand it
This is a letter, my word is the Beretta
The sound of my vendetta against the ones that  planned it

If my velocity starts to make you sweat
Then just don't let go
'Cause the emergency room got no vacancy
Tell me: Who do you trust, do you trust? And we just
Get up and go!
Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Kill the party with me
And never go home
Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home

You keep eternity
Give us the radio
Deploy the battery
We're taking back control
Engage the energy
Light up the effigy
No chance to take it slow
By now, I'm sure you know
Know, know, know, know, know
Get up and go!
(1, 2, 3, go!)

Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Kill the party with me
And never go home
Who they want you to be
Who they wanted to see
Just leave the party with me
And never go home
(Are we home?) Are we still having fun?
Are you holding the gun?
(Take me home) Take the money and run
We'll never go home
(Can we go?) I've got nothing to lose
You've got nothing to say
(And leave home) And we're leaving today
We'll never go home

I think I'm gonna go now
I think I'm gonna go now
(Get up and go) I think I better go now
Go home!
Gonna go now, gonna go now
Gonna go now, gonna go now
(Get up and go) Gonna go now, gonna go now
Go home!16Embed
