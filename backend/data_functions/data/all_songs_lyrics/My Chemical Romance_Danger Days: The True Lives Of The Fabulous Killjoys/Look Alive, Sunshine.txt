Look Alive, Sunshine Lyrics
"Look alive, sunshine! 109 in the sky, but the pigs won't quit, you're here with me, Dr. Death Defying. I'll be your surgeon, your proctor, your helicopter. Pumping out the slaughtermatic sounds to keep you alive, a system failure for the masses, antimatter for the master plan, louder than God's revolver and twice as shiny! This one's for all you rock 'n rollers, all you crash queens and motor babies, listen up!"
"The future is bulletproof!
The aftermath is secondary!
It's time to do it now and do it loud!
Killjoys, make some noise!"8Embed
