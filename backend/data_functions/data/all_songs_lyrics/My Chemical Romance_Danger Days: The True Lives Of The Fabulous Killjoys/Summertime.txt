Summertime Lyrics
When the lights go out
Will you take me with you
And carry all this broken bone
Through six years down
In crowded rooms and highways I call home?
Is something I can't know till now
Till you picked me off the ground
With brick in hand, your lip-gloss smile
Your scraped-up knees and

If you stay, I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes, how long until we
Find our way in the dark and out of harm?
You can run away with me anytime you want

Terrified of what I'd be
As a kid, from what I've seen
Every single day when people try
And put the pieces back together
Just to smash them down
Turn my headphones up real loud
I don't think I need them now
'Cause you stop the noise and
If you stay, I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes, how long until we
Find our way in the dark and out of harm?
You can run away with me anytime you want

Well, anytime you want
Well, anytime you want


Don't walk away, don't walk away
Don't walk away, don't walk away!

'Cause if you stay, I would even wait all night
Or until my heart explodes, how long until we
Find our way in the dark and out of harm?
You can run away with me

Or you can write it on your arm
You can run away with me
Anytime you want21Embed
