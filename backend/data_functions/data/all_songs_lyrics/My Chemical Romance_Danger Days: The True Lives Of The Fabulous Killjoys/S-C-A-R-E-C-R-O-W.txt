S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W Lyrics
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide

Make a wish when your childhood dies
Hear the knock, knock, knock when she cries
We're all alone tonight
Hold your breath when a blackbird flies
Count to seventeen and close your eyes
I'll keep you safe inside

He burns my skin
Never mind about the shape I'm in
I'll keep you safe tonight
Yeah, yeah, shut up and run with me!

Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide
Blow a kiss at the methane skies
See the rust through your playground eyes
We're all in love tonight (All in love tonight)
Leave a dream where the fallout lies
Watch it grow where the tear stain dries
To keep you safe tonight

He burns my skin
Never mind about the shape I'm in
I'll keep you safe tonight
Yeah, yeah, shut up and run with me!

Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide


Love, love, love won't stop this
Bomb, bomb, love won't stop this
Bomb, bomb, love won't stop this bomb
Run, run, bunny, run
Run, run, bunny, run
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide
Move your body when the sunlight dies
Everybody, hide your body from the scarecrow
Everybody, hide22Embed
