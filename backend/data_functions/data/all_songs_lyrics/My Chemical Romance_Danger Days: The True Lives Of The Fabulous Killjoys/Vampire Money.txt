Vampire Money Lyrics
Gerard: Well, are you ready, Ray?
Ray: Yeah!
Gerard: How 'bout you, Frank?
Frank: Oh, I'm there, baby!
Gerard: How 'bout you, Mikey?
Mikey: Fuckin' ready!
Gerard: Well, I think I'm alright!
One, two, three, four!

Three, two, one, we came to fuck
Everybody party 'til the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea 'til it's done

Hair back, collar up, jet black, so cool!
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you!

(Come on!) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on!) Play the game and take the band real far
(Come on!) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
(Come on!) Pick a fight at an airport bar
The kids don't care if you're alright, honey
Pills don't help, but it sure is funny
Gimme, gimme some of that vampire money, come on!
Oh, you look like somebody I used to know

Well, three, two, one, we got the bomb
Everybody hurry 'til the taxman comes
Glimmer like Bolan in the morning sun
And get your finger on the trigger, tap the barrel of the gun

Hair back, motherfucker! Jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you!

(Come on!) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on!) Play the game and take the band real far
(Come on!) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
(Come on!) Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright, honey
Pills don't help, but it sure is funny
Gimme, gimme some of that vampire money, come on!
Ah, fuck yeah, that's right, one, two, three, four!

Well, three, two, one, we came to fuck
Everybody party 'til the gasman comes
Sparkle like Bowie in the morning sun
And get a parking violation on La Brea 'til it's done

Hair back, collar up, jet black, so cool
Sing it like the kids that are mean to you!

(Come on!) When you wanna be a movie star
(Come on!) Play the game and take the band real far
(Come on!) Play it right and drive a Volvo car
(Come on!) Pick a fight at an airport bar

The kids don't care if you're alright, honey
Pills don't help, but it sure is funny
Gimme, gimme some of that vampire money, come on!
C'mon! (Well, I sure like the way)
C'mon! (Well, I sure like the way you're looking at me)
C'mon! (Well, I sure like the way you're looking at me right there!)
C'mon! (Well, I sure like the way you're looking at me right there!)
On! (There!) On! (There!) On! (There!) On! (There!) On!
Oh wait, oh, I'm such an idiot, our music is way too loud
Gonna have to turn it down a little, sorry!17Embed
