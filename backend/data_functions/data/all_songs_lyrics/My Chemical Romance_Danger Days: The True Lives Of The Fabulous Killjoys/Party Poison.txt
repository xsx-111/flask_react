Party Poison Lyrics
みんあ！
くるま わ まんたん だし
すーつけーす に わ ばくだん つめてーいる
じんせい わ みじかくて、 いく みち わ きけん が おーおい
だから おどろう！


All right! Everybody, pay attention to me
I got the answer
I got the answer, yeah
Streetwalking cheetah with a capital "G"
So get your hands up
Now get your hands up, yeah

Hide your eyes, we're gonna shine tonight
Subatomic never get the best of me
Ain't a DJ gonna save my soul (My soul)
I sold it long ago for rock 'n' roll (Whoa-oh)
Drop the needle when the tape deck blows
I gotta shout this out so everybody knows

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get-down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' all right
I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
They give you cancer
If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So, hit the lights, I'll do it again
And keep your cars, and your dogs, and your famous friends

Well, all right!
Slide up the faders when the cabinet slams
And get your hands up
Now get your hands up
Light up the stage and watch me kick out the jams
So, throw your fist up
Now throw your fist up

Ain't nobody gonna take my life
Ain't nobody gonna get the best of me
Ain't a preacher gonna save me now
Grab a seat, I'm going to show you how
Everybody, hit the pyro cue
We're gonna blow this off and show you what we do

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get-down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' all right
I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
They give you cancer
If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So, hit the lights, I'll do it again
And keep your cars, and your dogs, and your famous friends
Well, all right! Well, all right!
Well, all right! Oh, oh, oh, oh, well, all right...

We came to party
Kill the party tonight
We came to party
Kill the party tonight
Let's go!
Yūmei ni naritai no?
Maji de?
Eien to ikitai
Watashi wa bakuhatsu suru!

This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You want the get-down
Here comes the gang war
You're doin' all right
I got the answer
'Cause all the good times
Gimme, gimme good-times people tonight!
This ain't a party
Get off the dance floor
You wanna get down
Here comes the encore

If we were all like you in the end
Oh, we'd be killing ourselves by sleeping in
So, hit the lights, I'll do it again
So everybody get down (Minna de odorou!)
Till the party breaks down, (Karada ga itaku naru made!)
Now everybody get down (Minna de odorou!)
Now everybody get down (Karada ga itaku naru made!)
Till the party breaks down tonight!
Karada ga itaku naru made!
