The Only Hope for Me Is You Lyrics
(Remember me, remember me)
Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me

Where, where will you stand
When all the lights go out, across these city streets?
Where were you when all of the embers fell?
I still remember them
Covered in ash, covered in glass
Covered in all my friends
I still think of the bombs they built

If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you, alone

How it should be?
Many years after the disasters that we've seen
What have we learned
Other than people burn in purifying flame?
I say it's okay, I know you can tell
And though you can see me smile
I still think of the guns they sell
If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you, alone

The only hope for me
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope for me is you
The only hope is

If there's a place that I could be
Then I'd be another memory
Can I be the only hope for you?
Because you're the only hope for me
And if we can't find where we belong
We'll have to make it on our own
Face all the pain and take it on
Because the only hope for me is you, alone
The only hope for me is you, the only hope for me is you
(Remember me...)
The only hope for me is you, the only hope for me is you, alone
(Remember me...)
The only hope for me is you, the only hope for me is you
(Remember me...)
The only hope for me is you, the only hope for me is you, alone
(Remember me...)
