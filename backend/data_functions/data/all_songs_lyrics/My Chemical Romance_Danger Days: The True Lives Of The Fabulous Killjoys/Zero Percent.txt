Zero Percent Lyrics
I don't like being alone
Run up these streets, turn up the stereo
Synthetic animals like me never have a home
I'm not the one you will be walking through
And if you kill him for me
Well, then I'll kill him for you!
I'll meet you down at the metro station
Because motherfuckers got a motivation
Now, I'm going to show you how much I love you
Oh, my magazine is full of ugly things

Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll write it on the wall
I hope you die!

Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the prototype for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can try

Sometimes I sleep
I like to talk about television
Oh, a toxic letter now
Heartbreak, heartbeats
Got the eyes on you
And give us something to say
'Cause I got something to prove
I don't have much of an education
But I got a knack for elimination
Now turn up the dial
Hit the tires that screech
Let's go!
(Right here)
(Right now)
This is the bonus stage!
Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll write it on the wall
I hope you die

Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the prototype for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can try

I want annihilation
A new design for X and Y
I want your violation
Deflect the system with our mind
Exterminate the dream
Extermination you can, buy

Don't need the system
We can kill them if we try
Shoot up everything we see
And we'll find it on the wall
I hope you die
Manipulation
Just to form an alibi
You're the one that's right for me
And if heaven wants to take us they can

I hate you
Kill everybody!
I hate you
Kill everybody!5Embed
