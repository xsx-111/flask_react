Computer Heat LyricsI listen to dead roses comin' off of your breath
Yeah
I see a smile messed up around your hair
Yeah yeah yeah
Long nails of a workin' boy
Oh! You don't have the time
I listen to you
You listen to me, but we don't talk cuz you don't sleep
This is a computer heat
Brought to you by worr-r-r-k disease
And it's takin' all over town boy
Be ready it will bring us down boy
It might take us all dooooooown
Your hair grows you don't seem to like it
You miss the days
You don't seem to enjoy it
You mother calls
You friends never call
Your dog died and
Tomorow is monday againEmbed
