Off the Hook LyricsWhy is that we stand so still? (yeah)
People gonna start thinking we're statues (uh-huh)
This silence is disturbing me - people talk but I can't hear
I'm off the hook
Off the hook
I think I'm off the hook, baby
Off the hook
Let's find us both a place to sit
The more I talk the more my bones get heavy
This silence is disturbing me - don't they know I can't read lips?
I'm off the hook
Off the hook
I think I'm off the hook, baby
Off the hook
Off the hook
Yeah, you were right this is really fun
I never got this dumb before
Off the hook
Off the hook
I think I'm off the hook, baby
Off the hook
Why is that we stand so still?
People gonna start thinking we're statues
This silence is disturbing me - people talk but I can't hear
I'm off the hookEmbed
