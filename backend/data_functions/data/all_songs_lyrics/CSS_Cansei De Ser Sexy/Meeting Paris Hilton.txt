Meeting Paris Hilton Lyrics
Hello, this is Paris Hilton

I, I went to the beach
The beach was so hot
She came to me and said, "Do you like the beach, bitch?"
I said back, "I wanna take you home, bitch"
'Cause I wanna treat you good, bitch
What do you think of it, bitch?"

The bitch said yeah, the bitch said yeah
The bitch said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The bitch said yeah, the bitch said yeah
The bitch said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wanna be your summer Hilton time
With five diamond stars like your dad's biggest car
I wanna go to the Hiltons all over the world
And I, I wanna be just like you, bitch

The bitch said yeah, the bitch said yeah
The bitch said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The bitch said yeah, the bitch said yeah
The bitch said oh yeah! hell yeah! damn yeah!
I, the bitch said yeah
The bitch said yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah!
Said yeah
The bitch said yeah

The bitch said yeah, the bitch said yeah
The bitch said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The bitch said yeah, the bitch said yeah
The bitch said oh yeah! hell yeah! damn yeah!

I, I went to the beach
The beach was so hot
She came to me and said, "Do you like the beach, bitch?"
"Do you like the beach, bitch?"
"Do you like the beach, bitch?"
