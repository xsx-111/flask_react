Fuckoff Is Not the Only Thing You Have to Show Lyrics
You wake up, you don't wanna live today
You make up, you wanna look good again
You break up, you feel like you're crashin' down
You go to work, you wanna skip this round right now
(Right no-o-o-o-ow)
Right now
(Right no-o-o-o-ow)

You feel like you wanna change the life today
You feel bad, you didn't make it yesterday
You fall back, you think you ain't enough
You fall down, and it's hard to get up alone
(Alo-o-o-o-one)
Up alone
(Alo-o-o-o-one)
You feel like you wanna change the life today
You feel bad, you didn't make it yesterday
You fall back, you think you ain't enough
You fall down, and it's hard to get up alone
(Alo-o-o-o-one)
Up alone
(Alo-o-o-o-one)
Fuck off is not the only thing you have to show
Fuck off is not the only thing you have to show
Fuck off is not the only thing you have to show
Fuck off is not the only thing you have to show
I know, I knowEmbed
