This Month, Day 10 LyricsI am the last person you can call
Don't even know how we've met somehow
All beginnings must lead us into an end
I'll finish this shit this month, day ten
If someday we get to meet again
In a car crash, plane wreck or terrorist attack
Or maybe next Thursday night
Don't bother saying hi
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
Only with you
Only with you
I've got to get up, get high, get outta here
I can't stand the sound you're making lying next to me
I'm starting to imitate - that's imitation
I'm starting to imitate - that's imitation
This month, day ten I wonder if it's going to rain
Or maybe who knows
It's gonna be a sunny day
I'm starting to imitate - that's imitation
I'm starting to imitate - that's imitation
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
Only with you
Only with you
Im'ma tell you what I'll do
I'll break your face in two
I'll spread your teeth and blood all over this neighborhood
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, so rude
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, so rude
I'm gonna tell you what I'll do
I'll break your face in two
I'll break your legs, break your arms, break yourself in two
I'll break you in ten if I have to
Creation is something you don't give much attention
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, so rude
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, so rude
So, if someday we get to meet again
In a car crash, plane wreck or terrorist attack
Or maybe next Thursday night
Don't bother saying hi
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
I'll be rude, I'll be rude, I'll be rude
Only with youEmbed
