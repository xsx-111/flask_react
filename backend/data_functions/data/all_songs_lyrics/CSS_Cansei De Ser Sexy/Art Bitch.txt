Art Bitch LyricsMy art is called egocentric-soft-porno
Or maybe it's just narcisism...
My one and only subject
Goes from something like anything but
Me-ism
Wouldn't it be easier for Beardsley?
He could drop the paintings
And photograph his penis
Or take pixxx of the chicks...
Yeah, you know what I mean...
Wouldn't it be better for Escher?
He could drop the math
And make it happen on his mattress
2 girls and a cam!
3 girls and a cam!
You put a dog there and you got polaroid scam
I ain't no artist
I am an art-bitch
I sell my paintings to the men I eat
I have no portfolio
And I only show
Where there's free alcohol
I am so hardcore
I sell my crap and people ask for more...
Call me a revolutionaire
I poo on a plate and get it published on visionaire
What I do, is called art-shit
And don't you dare make fun of me
Cuz everything I do was featured on the pages of I.D.!
I ain't no artist
I am an art-bitch
I sell my paintings to the men I eat
I have no portfolio
And I only show
Where there's free alcohol
I ain't no artist
I am an art-bitch
I sell my paintings to the men I eat
I have no portfolio
And I only show
Where there's free alcohol
Lick lick lick my art-tit (x2)
Suck suck suck my art-hole (x2)
