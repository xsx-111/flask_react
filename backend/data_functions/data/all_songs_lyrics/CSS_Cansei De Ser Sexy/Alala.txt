Alala LyricsAlala, alala
Gimme three wishes
I wanna be that dirtyfinger and his ¿such/sete witches/wishes? (two words, garbled)
Alala, alala
Gimme more too
I wanna be in that crazy band or meu cu (PORTUGUESE: my ass, or possibly the band Meauku)
Alala, alala
Would you be kind
Gimme one little more
And I'll be super fine
Alala, alala
You're so cool
Can I be your friend?
I'll drive you till the end
Cuz you know but you don't wanna
Cuz you want but you can't have it
Cuz you know but you don't wanna
Cuz you want but you can't have it
Alala, alala
I'm so worried
I bought the posh clothing
But it still looks ugly
Alala, alala
Am I stupid?
I'm doing the talking
But it don't get nothing
Alala, alala
Alguém me avisa (PORTUGUESE: somebody warn me)
Quando é bom parar (when its good to stop)
De fazer a íntima (making intimacy or intimate moves)
Alala, alala
You're so cool
Can I be your friend?
I'll drive you till the end
Cuz you know but you don't wanna
Cuz you want but you can't have it
Cuz you know but you don't wanna
Cuz you want but you can't have it
(repeat)
Alala, alala
Gimme three wishes
I wanna be that dirtyfinger and his ¿such or sete? (garbled) bitches
Alala, alala
Gimme more two
I wanna be in that crazy band or meu cu (or Meauku?)
Alala, alala
Alguém me avisa
Quando é bom parar
De fazer a íntima
Alala, alala
You're so cool
Can I be your friend?
I'll drive you till the end
Cuz you know but you don't wanna
Cuz you want but you can't have it
Cuz you know but you don't wanna
Cuz you want but you can't have it
