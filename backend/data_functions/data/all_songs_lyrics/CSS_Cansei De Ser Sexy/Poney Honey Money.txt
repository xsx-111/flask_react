Poney Honey Money LyricsPonyhoneymoney
I love you so
You are all I ever wanted
I am happier now you know
When I was just a girl
You were my friend
I could ride you around and brush your bright rainbow hair
Ponyponypony
You're drivin' me through the air
Honeyhoneyhoney
You're a simply the best
Moneymoneymoney
You never let me down
Ponyhoneymoney
Ponyhoneymoney
Ponyhoneymoney stay with me
We sleep when we're down so we can dream
Remenber the timechinese was so weird
You were just little biy gettin' ready for me
Ponyponypony you're drivin' me through the air
Honeyhoneyhoney don't act like you don't care
Moneymoneymoney
I need you so
So I can take poney and honey to they're favorite rock show
