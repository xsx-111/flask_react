One More Time Lyrics
I'd love to touch the sky, tonight
I'd love to touch the sky
So take me in your arms
And lift me like a child
And hold me up so high
And never let me go
Take me
Take me in your arms tonight
Hold me
Hold me up so high
And never let me down
Hold me
Hold me up so high
To touch the sky
Just one more time

Take me in your arms, tonight
Take me in your arms
Just one more time2Embed
