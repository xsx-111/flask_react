The Kiss Lyrics

Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me
Your tongue is like poison
So swollen it fills up my mouth
Love me, love me, love me
You nail me to the floor
And push my guts all inside-out
Get it out, get it out, get it out
Get your fucking voice
Out of my head

I never wanted this!
I never wanted any of this!
I wish you were dead!
I wish you were dead!4Embed
