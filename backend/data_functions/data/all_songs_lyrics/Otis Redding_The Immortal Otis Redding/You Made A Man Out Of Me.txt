You Made A Man Out Of Me LyricsYou make a man just wanna change his mind
Everything you do
You sent me through, yes
And I love you for it
'Cause you made a big ol' man, girl, out of me
I can't explain, baby what you did for me now
But I love you for it
'Cause you made a big ol' man, girl, out of me
You made a big ol' man, girl, out of me, baby
I'm a sweet
You gave me everything
And I love you for it, darling
'Cause you made a great big man out of meEmbed
