A Waste Of Time Lyrics
How dare should I have asked you, "What's your name?"
Should you ask me the same?
But dig, let's don't be wasting our time
Let's don't leave each other blind
If you don't want me
My heart can't stand it another time
There's only 24 hours in a day
But that don't leave much time to play
I don't dig that no way, honey
'Cause my heart can't take it, no, another day

Listen to me, honey
I've been told by many different girls
"Otis, I love you"
Oh boy, they tell me this
From the bottom of their soul
But they didn't mean it, listen
I, I've been let down, hit the ground
And called the biggest, the biggest fool
The biggest fool to ever walk on this ground
Listen

I can't stand it, no no no no
To be built up, way on up, and let down
Being in love, y'all, is all in my mind
I don't like that, I like for it to be from my heart
And I found out later I was wasting my time
Just a waste of time, yeah
Somebody understand what I'm saying when I say
It's just a waste of time
If you don't want me, mama, don't just leave me hangin'
Don't just let me waste my time, no, no
Somebody, somebody got to get the message to meEmbed
