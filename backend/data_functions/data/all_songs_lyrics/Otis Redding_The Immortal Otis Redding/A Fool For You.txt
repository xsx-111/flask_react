A Fool For You Lyrics
I know you told me
Long time ago
That you didn't want me
You didn't love me no more

But I know it was something
Oh, that made me blue
But believe me, child
I've been a fool for you
I've been a big fool for ya

I know you told me, yeah
You didn't want me around
I know that you had a big ol' man
Right there in an apartment way across town

And I know it's something
Ooh, that makes me blue
Believe me, child
I've been a fool for you
I've been a fool for you
Now, did you ever wake up in the morning
Just about the break of day, yeah
Reach over and feel your pillow
Where that little fine fox used to lay
Ever since I was five years old, baby
I've been a, a fool for you
Way down, deep down in my soul
I've been a fool for you

But I know it's something
Oh, what makes me blue
Believe me child, I've a fool for you
I've been a fool for you

I've been a fool for you
I've been a fool for you
I've been a fool for you
I've been just so bad
I've just been treated so badly
You don't know what you're doing to me
But I just can't understand it
No no no, baby, yeah
I've been a fool for you, honey
I've been a great big fool for you, baby
A lowdown dirty fool for you, mamaEmbed
