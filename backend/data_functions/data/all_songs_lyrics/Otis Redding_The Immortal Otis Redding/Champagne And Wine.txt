Champagne And Wine Lyrics
Sitting here thinking about the times I've roamed
Different girls that I have known
Of all girls that I have met
You are the one girl that I can't forget
Listen
We had our time now
Good and bad now
I can't forget 'em
And I sure ain't gon' forget 'em now
Remember Side Street
Where we used to meet
Making love, nobody but you and me

Champagne and wine
That's what you gonna get
Champagne and wine
What it's gon' be
Just as long, girl, as you see about me

I'm gonna be knocking on your door
I want the same love that I had before
Listen
I'm a man now, full grown man
You got me eating from the tip of your hand
I don't mind eating
Long as you feed me
Good love and good ol' sympathy
Champagne and wine
That's what it's gon' be

Every day is gonna just be like Sunday
Every night you're gonna have stars in the sky
Ooh, giving you champagne and wine
I'm gonna give it to you, ooh, ooh wee
Ooh, na na na na na na na na na na
Ooh wee, baby, giving you champagne and wine
I really love you, baby
I really do need you, honey
Really do want you, baby
Really do love you, honeyEmbed
