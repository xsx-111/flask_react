Street Song LyricsI walked down to the sidewalk, the night was crying rain
I heard wandering thunder like a crash in someone's tin
I can tell from the lightning's flashing that the storm would not refrain
The wind blew through the treetops and I saw some windowpane
I heard someone down in the alley a little voice called out my name
I saw the ghost of our wrecked romance it was lost in the pouring rain
Well I'm going back to the country
Up on the mountains up on the rising side
And if you should ever leave me
Send me a letter with some love inside
Where are you? Married? And in a good place?
I need to know to be satisfied
I walked on through the darkness, the night still pouring rain
The wind blew through the treetops and I saw some windowpane
I saw the ghost of our wrecked romance, it was lost in the pouring rain
One thing I have learned in my time in the skies and on the ground
All the fires changed motivation, yet I burned to love that soundEmbed
