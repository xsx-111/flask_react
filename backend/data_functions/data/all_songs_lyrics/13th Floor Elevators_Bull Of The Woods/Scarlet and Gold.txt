Scarlet and Gold LyricsHe's a king, he's a poor boy, a coward and a stranger
See him standing there so all alone
Well I guess that he'll keep standing there until he's called for
And tomorrow's hurricanes have blown
His hate grew old, another story told
He found no trust to call his own
His way was lost, his spirit was the cost
He couldn't make up for the loan
But many great man are returning
Back to the place where it began
And our tired eyes will cease their burning
When the devil's bones lay parching in the sun
And the night man is waiting at the station
Gathering all the stops one by one
I suggest that you make a reservation
Before all these things are done
A fella had the blues
His life was filled with pain
When he heard the news
He lost a lot in vain
Someone once spread the word
His house went up in flames
They didn't even smoke
I'm sure they're not to blame
All your secrets, they've all been told
Trade in your scarlet and your gold
He's a king, he's a poor boy, a coward and a stranger
See him standing out there so all alone
Well I guess that he'll keep standing there until he's called for
And tomorrow's hurricanes have blown
But many great man are returning
Back to the place where it began
And our tired eyes will cease their burning
When the devil's bones lay parching in the sun
And the night man is waiting at the station
Gathering all the stops one by one
I suggest that you make a reservation
Before all these things are doneEmbed
