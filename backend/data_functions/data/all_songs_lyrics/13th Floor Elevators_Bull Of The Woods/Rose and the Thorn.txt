Rose and the Thorn LyricsA brand new smile on a brand new angel's face
It won't change, it won't change
You're here to stay until your last living breath is complete
It' won't change, it won't change
Here she comes, my love
With the earth beneath her feet
My love she comes
She cares
I do not ask her why she cares
She cares
And this is not untold
Within her eyes
Spoken by her soul
The dawn of truth will rise!
Liberty will find us
Grown cold, and make him stoned
The canon stops it's firing
The unknown soldier will come home
Faith cannot remain
Wicked words have been confirmed false
A single drop of the rain
The rose and and thorn...
The Rise and the Fall!Embed
