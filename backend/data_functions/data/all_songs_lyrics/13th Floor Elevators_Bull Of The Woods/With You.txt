With You LyricsDreams are told by people around you
If you should watch them they soon will astound you
I know a guy who says he has a friend who
Said he dreamed nice things when he was around you
Dreams, dreams can help you believe me
Dreams, dreams can cease all your grieving
How do you pay them any mind?
How do you pay them any mind?
Written in trust is what we should strive for
Speak not the truth and soon you'll be called for
Someday is coming and soon I'll be asking
Ready yourself for love everlasting
Wind, rain, sun and sea
Cannot keep your love from me
All these things were meant to be
Dreams, dreams can help you believe me
Dreams, dreams can cease all your grieving
How do you pay them any mind?
How do you pay them any mind?
How do you pay them any mind?
How do you pay them any mind?Embed
