Til Then LyricsI hear the sound of feet, they're dancing in the street
There's a change coming on, I have a feeling it won't be long
The sound of bells a'ringing, the sound of people singing
Someday, my love, someday
Heals sadness broken hearts and the madness soon departs
We'd knew we found a way as what it takes to say
When each man lends his voice and read his only choice
Someday, my love, someday
Someday, my love, someday
Someday, my love, someday
Someday, my love...
A change is coming on, and you know it won't take long
This is where the laughter plays, so to lift your happy ways
As the echo builds and swirls, and you know the carpet fills
Then everyone will fly through space, and so joins the human race
The new will soon be found, as the air fills up with sound
The sound of bells a'ringing, the sound of people singing
And each man lends his voice and read his only choice
Someday, my love, someday
Someday, my love, someday
Someday
Someday, my loveEmbed
