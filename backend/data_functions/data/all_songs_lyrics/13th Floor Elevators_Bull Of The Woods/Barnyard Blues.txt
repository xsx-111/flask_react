Barnyard Blues LyricsYou duck, count, and run
I say 'Eeny-Meeny'
You took my mind and bent it freely
I don't know how you manage all alone
I think you put me through a change
I think you put me through a lovin' change
You are the pilot on my plane
You are the whistle on my new electric train
You are my magician's magic cane
I went to the barnyard to scratch a balloon
You know I'm all for love, I'm all forgiven
Someday I hope to give you my nameEmbed
