Never Another LyricsThe story you are living from the other symphony
Insures such coolness inside my heart of love in harmony
Your simplest pleasure echoes out your entire destiny
Our fates combined will have no end
Give your love to me
I groove on yours
Change in mine
It's bright
It's in our hearts combined
It's not chance wait with you now our thing happens
Right on time
Hate to see that our two backs cannot make one human
Freedom palace burns our souls and makes up all the new ones
No more aces you can leave me
And just some one lead me where
Where to get faces but that won't leave me
Where you're sure is just out there
It's only I love you when you need me
It's only I love you goddamn
It's only I love you
Forgive me
And the genus us all we share
Never another line and another lie
Do what you would do what you didEmbed
