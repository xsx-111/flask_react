Dr. Doom LyricsDear Doctor Doom, I read your recent letter
You've left some room, I hope you're feeling better
Noble hearts decision, pinecone lies the future
Newer further freedoms, body mind and soul
Love's embracing chalice is the light fantastic
Helping link the rumors of the mor√© bowl
Double funnel final each mind in its middle
One in this existence from the other folds
Beginning no end, alpha no omega
Two mouths one voice still appears
We won't join in sameness, we are each one different
We won't join in oneness when we're each one whole
We'll be like in feeling, being of the spirit
Housed in body crystals, ever always soul
We'll be right beside him, all we've been is beauty
All will be in union, from our life unfolds
Beginning no end, alpha no omega
Two mouths one voice still appears
Dear Doctor Doom, read your recent letter
No, you can't make heaven in the east nirvana
But you can make certain that the ghost is there
And the always presence you have found within you
Is the same in heaven fully made aware
Sooner seen past watching
Sooner heard past listening
Sooner said past talking
From yours anywhereEmbed
