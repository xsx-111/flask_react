Gunface Lyrics
Going to go downtown
Going to get my gun
Going to dress real sharp
Going to beat my drum
I ain't going to lie
Going to walk so slow
Going to talk just right
And my diamond ring
Going to shine so bright
I ain't going to lie

I've got a debt to repay
I ain't going to cry
I put a gun in your face
You'll pay with your life

And I got my ears
And I got my eyes
And I got my narks
On my alibis
I won't waste your time
Make it one false move
Make it one mistake
When the juice is squeezed
That's the way it breaks
You'll pay for the crime
Your tongue licking way out of place
I'll rip it out, yeah
I'll stick a gun in your face
You'll pay with your life, I tell you

I taught her everything
I taught her how to dream
I taught her everything
I'm going to teach her how to scream
I taught her all she knows
I taught her how to lie
I taught her everything
I'm going to teach her how to cry

And you cause me hurt
And you cause me pain
And you turned the tap
On my burning rage
Now I can't put it out
Going to leave no sign
Going to leave no trace
Going to leave this town
In a state of grace
Give me the power
I tell you that
I've got a debt to repay
I ain't going to lie
I put a gun in your face
You'll pay for the crime

I taught her everything
I taught her how to speak
I taught her all she knows
I taught her how to eat
I half invented her
And now she acts so chic
I taught her everything
But now she's obsolete


I taught her everything
How to read and write
I taught her all she knows
She was a neophyte
I taught her everything
I loved to watch her grow
I taught her everything
And now I want to see her go
I taught her everything, ah yeah
I got a debt to repay
I ain't going to cry
I'll put a gun in your face
You're playing with your life

I taught her everything
I taught her how to cheat
I taught her all she knows
She was so indiscreet
I taught her everything
I taught her how to lie
I taught her everything
I'm going to teach her how to cry

Yeah
I taught her everything, oh yeahEmbed
