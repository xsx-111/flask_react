How Can I Stop Lyrics
You offer me all your love and sympathy
Sweet affection baby, it's killing me
Because baby, baby, can't you see

How could I stop once I start, baby
How could I stop once I start
How could I stop
Yeah yeah
How could I stop once I start

You look at me but I don't know what you see
A reflection baby  of what I want to be
I see your face and I want to roll with it
But how could I stop, baby, how could I stop
How could I stop
Stop it, stop it

If I could, I'd take you all the way
Baby, baby listen what I say
There's even some things that I just would not pay

Because how could I stop if I start, babe
How could I stop if I start
Start with you
How could I stop if I start, baby
How could I stop if I start with you, babe
It's too easy to lay here at your feet
I couldn't take the heat
There's somewhere else maybe you should go
Baby, maybe baby, just a further down the road

How could I stop if I start with you, baby
How could I stop
How could I stop once I start
You tell me baby, once I've started with you
How could I stop once I start
How could I stop
Stop, stop, stop
How could I stop

How could I stop
How could I stop
How could I stopEmbed
