Out of Control Lyrics
I was out in the city
I was out in the rain
I was feeling down hearted
I was drinking again
I was standing by the bridges
Where the dark water flows
I was talking to a stranger
About times long ago

I was young, I was foolish
I was angry, I was vain
I was charming, I was lucky
Tell me how, how I've changed

Now I'm out, oh, out of control
Now I'm out, oh, out of control, yeah
Oh, help me now, yeah

And the girls in the doorway
And the boys on the game
And the drunks and the homeless
They all know me
And the police on the corner
Give a nod and a wave
As they point me
To my final destination
I was young, I was foolish
I was angry, I was vain
I was charming, I was lucky
Tell me how, how I've changed

Now I'm out, oh, out of control, oh
Now I'm out, whoa, out of control
Whoa, help me now

In the hotel, I'm excited
By the smile on her face
But I wondered
How was time gonna change her?

I was young, I was foolish
I was angry, I was vain
I was charming, I was out there
Tell me how, how I've changed

Now I'm out, whoa, out of control, oh yes
Oh, I'm out, oh, out of control
Oh yes, I amEmbed
