Flip the Switch Lyrics
A scrap of flesh and a heap of bones
One deep high and a desperate moan
Three black eyes and a busted nose
I said oh yeah, oh yeah

Take me up
Baby, I'm ready to go
Shake me up
Baby, I'm ready to go, yeah
Take me up
Baby, I'm ready
Baby, baby I'm ready to go
(Chill me, freeze me, It's in my blood)

I'm not going to burn in hell
I cased the joint and I know it well
Maybe my carcass would feed the worms
But I'm working for the other firm

Take me up
Baby, I'm ready to go
Fix me up
Baby, I'm ready to roll, yeah
Set me up
Baby, baby, baby I'm ready, baby I'm ready to go
(Chill me, freeze me, it's in my blood)
Flip the switch
I got my money, my ticket
All that shit
I even got myself a little shaving kit
What would it take to bury me
I can't wait
I can't wait to see
I got toothbrush, mouthwash
All that shit
I'm looking down in the filthy pit
I had the turkey and the stuffing too
I even saved a little bit for you

Lethal injection is a luxury
I want to give it to the whole jury
I'm just dying for one more squeeze
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Pick me up
Baby, I'm ready to go
Take me up
Baby, I'm ready to blow
Take me up
Baby, if you're ready to go
Baby, I got nowhere to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
(Chill me, freeze me, to my bones)
