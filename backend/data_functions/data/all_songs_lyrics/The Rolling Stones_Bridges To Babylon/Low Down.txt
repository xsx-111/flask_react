Low Down Lyrics
Won't you give me the low down
Just as quick as you can
Babe, I've been out of touch
Just give me the scam
Don't give me the sports page, baby
No political news
Don't you give me the gossip
Just give me the truth
Just between me and you

Give me the low down if you can
I don't want a show down
I just want to know where I stand

Don't read me the horoscope, baby
That ain’t what I need
Our future will never last
But that's between you and me
I don't want the movie section
I'll see for myself
I don't want the news that fits
Shove it back on the shelf
Give me the truth
Just between me and you
Give me the low down if you can
I don't want a show down
I just want to know where I stand


The headlines are screaming
They change everyday
As long as I ain’t in them
I'm happy that way
I know that you won't lie to me
But you hold back the truth
Please give me the low down
I can only get it from you
Give me the truth
Just between me and you

Give me the low down if you can
I don't want a show down
I just want to know where I stand

Yeah yeah yeah give me the low down
As quick as you can
I don't want to hear about it (Just between me and you)
I want it straight from you
Give me the lowdown (Just between, just between me and you)
Come on baby (Just between, just between and you)
Give me the juice
Come on, oh yeah (Just between, just between and you)Embed
