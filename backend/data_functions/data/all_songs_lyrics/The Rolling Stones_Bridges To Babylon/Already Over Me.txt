Already Over Me Lyrics
As you poured out the drinks for me
I felt your hooks sink right into me
And I knew you were my destiny
And I thought you'd get the best of me

On the way down to Mexico
As I danced in your rodeo
You say poverty is picturesque
As you dragged your nails across my chest

You're so cold, you're so cruel
I'm your man, not your fool

Are you already over me?
Are you already over me?
Are you already over me?
What a fool I've been

In the first flush of ecstasy
As you lay naked next to me
While our love put the dawn to flight
I just ignore all those warning lights
Because when you laugh, I just cry
When you left, I just died

Are you already over me?
Are you already over me?
Are you already sick of me?
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been

Hard to hold on to a love divine
I'm kneeling in a corner, praying to your shrine

I've been hurt, so confused
I've been burned, I've been bruised

Are you already over me?
Are you already over me?
Are you already sick of me?
Are you already over me?
Are you, are you already over me?
Are you already tired of me?
Are you already over me?
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've been
What a fool I've beenEmbed
