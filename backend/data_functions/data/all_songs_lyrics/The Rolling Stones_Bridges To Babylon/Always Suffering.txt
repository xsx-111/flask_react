Always Suffering Lyrics
Let's take a walk just you and me
And talk of days gone by
Across the fields, under the trees
Let's speak of you and I
While the whole world was wandering
We walked a steady line
When all our friends were wavering
We kept on trying

Now we're always suffering
Already lost
Always suffering
Already lost

Remember when on summer days
I would sing a lovers song
How you would smile, shower me with praise
And the sun shined on
Now the rain is falling slow
And the nights grow long
And the train cries out so hauntingly
She is gone
Now we're always suffering
Already lost
Always suffering
Already lost

Please take these flowers, smell the perfume
Let your soul come alive
Let there be hope, hope in your heart
That our love may revive
Ah yeah
For life is but a chance
On a wind swept hill
And the seeds of love are swirling above
Let them be still
Oh yeah

But we're always suffering
We're already lost
Always suffering
Already lost
Yeah

Always suffering
Always suffering
We're already lostEmbed
