Too Tight Lyrics
Babe, don't get too tight with me
Yes, you're far too tight for me
I got your messages and how can I resist
But if you come around, don't slap the cuffs upon my wrist

Baby you're tight for me
Gonna warn you, girl
Far too tight for me
Yeah
Untie those sheep shanks, yes, and all those fancy knots
I'm not Houdini, honey, c'mon now and loosen up
(Tight)
(Too tight)
(Too tight)
(Too tight)

Yeah, don't try to reel me in
With all those charm school looks
I've seen it all a thousand times
I sung that song, I wrote that fucking book

Do yourself a favor now
Don't drive me 'round the block
Let's split another bottle, now
Let's take a hit, loosen up

But don't get too tight on me
Because I'm, I'm bound so tight I can't breathe
We'll watch the sun go down upon the swollen sea
If you try to chain me up, I'll vanish like a broken dream

Don't get so tight on me
Don't get so tight on me
Too tight
Don't get so tight
Far too tight
Don't get tight on me
No don't get too tight on me
Don't get too, don't get too tightEmbed
