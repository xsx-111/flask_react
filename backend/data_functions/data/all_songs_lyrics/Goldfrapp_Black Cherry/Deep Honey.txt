Deep Honey Lyrics
Your wild lies always start with wide, white lines
Summer shine
Your wild lies always start with wide, white lines
Summer shine

You don't like the dark
Fringed by the silver sea
Always brave and pert
Sunday sun, you're up

You just don't love me and you
Just started
Your wild lies always start with wide, white lines
Summer shine

You don't like the dark
Moon is on the sky
You don't like the star
Shining down
Tears start
