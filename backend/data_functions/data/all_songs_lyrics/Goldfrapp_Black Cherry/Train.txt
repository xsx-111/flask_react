Train Lyrics
Plastic brain scar, I want laser
I'm your chauffeur with high gloss highs
Take you where you want

Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeh, yeh, yeh

Wolf lady sucks my brain
Apricot sunrise came
L.A. nights, just roll in

Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Nasal douche, poolside line
Softlit tan, what's your sign?
Hold my hand, just roll in

Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stop, oh off the train
Train, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stop, oh, off the train
Train, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't stop, oh off the train
Train, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
