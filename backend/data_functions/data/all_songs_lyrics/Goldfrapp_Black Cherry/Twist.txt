Twist Lyrics
Before you go and leave this town
I want to see you one more time
Put your dirty angel face
Between my legs and knicker lace

Fight me, try me
Kiss me like you like me
Twist it round again and again

I want to run away with you
Your caravan and rabbit stew
Don't buy me candyfloss or bears
Swarfega fingers, I want you there

Fight me, try me
Kiss me like you like me
Twist it round again and again

Ride me, try me
Kiss me like you like me
Twist it round again and again
Twist it round again and again
Fight me, try me
Kiss me like you like me
Twist it round again and again

Fight me, try me
Kiss me like you like me
Twist it round again and again
Twist it round again and again
Twist it round again and againEmbed
