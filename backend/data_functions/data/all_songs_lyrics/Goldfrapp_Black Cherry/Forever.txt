Forever Lyrics
Here I wanna be a stranger
Drift in and then out just linger
Slow motion you fall like a blossom
Way out there on a star, nova lazy

Life, love
Just in love
Life, love
Love, love

Write it down, but don't send the letter
When it shines we're forever

Here I wanna be a stranger
Way out there on a star, nova lazy

Life, love
Just in love
Life, love
Love, love

Just don't leave me here
Just don't leave me hereEmbed
