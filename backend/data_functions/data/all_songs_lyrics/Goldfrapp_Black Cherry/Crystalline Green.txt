Crystalline Green Lyrics
Here we come, driving down
Deep and wide, settle down
On the beach, get the sun
Coming down, wet and warm

Turn it down, settle down
On the beach, get the sun
On the down, jealous day
You can lounge, turn it down

I wanna waste it playing
Spend all our day in a dream
Crystalline green, watch it rolling
Feeling the weight of the sun


Here we come, driving down
Deep and wild, blue and green
Breathing in, come alive
Here we come, all the stars
Let it slip through my fingers
Little rings float in your eyes
Try to forget who you are now
Stare into space, watch the sky
