Black Cherry Lyrics
How can it be? I can taste you now
How can I see when you're everything?

All the world in one grain of sand
And I've blown it
All my world in one grain of sand
And you own it

Black cherry, black cherry
Stone
Black cherry, black cherry

Hearing you say it, I could die
Trembling star just reminds me

All the world in one grain of sand
And I've blown it
All my world in one grain of sand
And you own it

Black cherry, black cherry
Stone
Black cherry, black cherry
Excite me, ignite me
Oh and you know
I miss you, I kiss you
Oh and you know

Black cherry, black cherry
Stone
Black cherry, black cherry

Excite me, ignite me
Oh and you know
I miss you, I kiss you
Oh and you know1Embed
