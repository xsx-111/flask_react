Muddy Funster LyricsWasn’t you I was tiptoeing for
But you gave me a grin
Wasn’t you I was tiptoeing for
But you gave me a grin
This is not even a close call
But a must
Yeah, I would have done it differently
But that's on me
I can jump off a building, I'm a hero
But that's on me
Yeah, I believe the climate is changing, oh, yeah
Yeah, we've done this a few times, we've prepared a lot
I wouldn't have done it differently, but that's on me
Hardly a man takes a half hours nap after dinner
But when he wakes, he holds up his head and dances
On the furniture
What's the news? (The news...)
To a hammer, everything looks like a nail
They spoke of their children and their fears about the future
Therapy without the therapist
One day, I simply closed my eyes and nothing happened...Embed
