Colors of Autumn Lyrics
You know that
I'm not a one-girl man
When we first started, I said that
Then later, you couldn't comprehend
You called me G.O.A.T
And that's what I wanted to be
My mama told you I'd be
Willing to make things right
Driving in my drop-top Jeep
Two OGs sitting in the shotgun seat
We argue sometimes
On yours and all mine
And just by design
We're falling deeper in love

We are the colors of autumn
And even when we're falling, it's still so good

You know that
I'm not a one-girl man
When we first started, I said that
Then later, you couldn't comprehend
So, twenty-one years, I've never been savage
The male version of Spike Lee, she's gotta have it
Yeah, so with you I gotta have it
Gotta be Mobb Deep and you causing Havoc, ayy
I know that your mom and dad was thinking
I'll be that rapper for an evening
But nothing to stick for through the seasons
But I was stubborn
You called me G.O.A.T
And that's what I wanted to be
My mama told you I'd be
Willing to make things right
We are the colors of autumn
And even when we're falling, it's still so good
The leaves are falling
But they're so colorful, they're so wonderful2Embed
