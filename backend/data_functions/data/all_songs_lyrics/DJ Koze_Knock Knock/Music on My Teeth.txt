Music on My Teeth Lyrics"Time is a social institution and not a physical reality"
Honey honey
Honey honey
On my nose
On your titties
Honey honey
Honey honey
On my nose
On your titties
Sweet sweet lips
And your swaying hips
Rocking us to sleep
Honey honey
Honey honey
On my nose
On your titties
Sweet sweet lips
And your swaying hips
And your swaying hips
Sweet sweet lips
And your swaying hips
Rocking us to sleep
Rocking us to sleep
Rocking us to sleep
"Listen to the music today children
Daily, every night I had to take the music, 4 hours maybe, that's 12, 14, too long
Bobby, we sells music
Yeah I sell music in the day then I run a beer garden at nights
And I play music from 7:30, wrap after 4, 5, 5:30, 6:30 in the morning
So Iâ€™m with it
Look at my teeth
It's the music on it
I live music and I speak music
Music is my occupation
Music on my teeth"Embed
