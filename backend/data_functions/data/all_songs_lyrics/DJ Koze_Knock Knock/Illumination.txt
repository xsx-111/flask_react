Illumination LyricsAnd you fall and fall and fall
And you fall and fall and fall
And you fall and fall and fall
Into another love dimension
On and onâ€¦ I keep running on empty
I'm a greedy girl
And your cup, overflowed with plenty
Got no right to be so high and mighty
You got no right to look down on me
You need to do right by me
You might like to treat me lightly
A little more lightly
On and on and on and on
It only gathers momentum
You rise and rise and rise enough
All the way to heaven
And you fall and fall and fall
Into another love dimension
Just like a bolt right out the blue (running on empty...)
Just like a bolt right out the blue
When you seek inspiration
I need a bit of light here
I need a bit of light here
I need a bit of light hereEmbed
