Moving in a Liquid LyricsThis feels like moving in a liquid
Keep sifting through my close clenched hand
It's still new for you to come with
This pain, this life that makes you wonder
She the arrows in your heartbreaks
The wave of joy will pull you under
You say I'm a heartbreaker
A lonely boy
You say I'm a heartbreaker
A lonely boy
This feels like moving in a liquid
A melting piece of golden sand
This very moment painted with it
Keep sifting through my close clenched hand
This feels like moving in a liquid
A melting piece of golden sand
She the arrows in your heartbreaks
Keep sifting through my close clenched handEmbed
