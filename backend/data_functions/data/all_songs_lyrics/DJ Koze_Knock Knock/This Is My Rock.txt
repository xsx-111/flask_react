This Is My Rock LyricsYou
Too
Forever I turn into hard crystal
So transparent I can't find my way
Can you hear from the top of the roof?
Forever I turn into hard crystal
(Thought it would be over, but I think it's starting over again)
So transparent I can't find my way out
(Where you go each time you leave my door)
Free me from the depths of this world
This is what I mean
Thought it would be over, but I think it's starting over again
And these terrifying things I see through it
(I'm lone)
He is not the same
Forever I turn
Forever I turn into hard crystal
(Can you hear me?)
But a livin' spark (After I've been good to you)
In the gentleness of your knees
This is what I mean
We're lost in the city
We're lost in the clocks (can...)
And we climbed the rocks (lost in the clocks)
And turned to hard crystal (oh)
Hard crystal
Hard crystal
This is my rock (hard crystal, yeah)
And here I run
This is my rock (again)
And here I run (and these terrifying things I see)
This is my rock (hard crystal, yeah)
And here I run
This is my rock (of this world)
And here I run (oh yeah)
And these terrifying things I see
(Thought it would be over, but I think it's starting over)
And these terrifying things I see through it
Again
Again
Thought it would be over, but I think it's starting over again

I see little tears in your eyes
About to fallEmbed
