Scratch That LyricsScratch
That
That ain't how I wanna play it
I was ready to catch
That train
Get the hell out of this place
My grand plan
Hasn't worked out the way I wanted
Guess falling in love can
Bring you right back the way you started, yeah
Scratch
That
That ain't how I wanna play it
I wanna catch
That train
To get the hell out of this place
My grand plan
I guess falling it love can't
No
No
Bring you right back the way you started
That ain't how I wanna play it
I was meant to
Catch that train
Get the hell out of this place
I guess falling in love can't
I guess falling in love can't
Stop
I guess falling in love can't
No
