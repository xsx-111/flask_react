This Is My Fate Lyrics
Lake of the long ton of the angel cake
Only got one dirty mandrake
"Hold that train", I told that skinner man
This is my place, this is my fate

Cross of the one-arm wine that's fortified
Now, to hasten crucifixion
"Hold that train", I told that skinner man
This is my place

Take a little more drink, that’s alright
Take a little more drink, it's alright
Take a little more drink, that's alright
Take a little more drink, this is my fate
"Hold that train", I told that skinner man

Hey, mourning spirits singing harmony
Borax Mine Works, Valley of Death
"Hold that train", I told that skinner man
This is my place

Take a little more drink, that’s alright
Take a little more drink, it's alright
Take a little more drink, that's alright
Take a little more drink
This is my fate, this is my place
This is my fate, this is my place
This is my fate, this is my place
This is my fate, my fate, my fateEmbed
