Bird of Prey Lyrics
Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie

I'll set my broken bone
With a twist and a crack
Now your cover's blown
You buried me, but I came back
You've stolen my tomorrow
So I come for it today
You stole it when you stole my yesterday

Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie

Here in my heart
I hear you far away
Deep in the dark
My little bird of prey
I have your mark
Well, I'm flying through the rag
Crack the whip from my cal√®che
I have the horse's speed
And if I need the horse's flesh
Fire for the tallow
But I still can't find the way
You stole it when you stole my yesterday

Here in my heart
I hear you far away
Deep in the dark
My little bird of prey
I have your mark
I hear you far away
Deep in my heart
My little bird of prey
I have your mark

Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie
Little birdie2Embed
