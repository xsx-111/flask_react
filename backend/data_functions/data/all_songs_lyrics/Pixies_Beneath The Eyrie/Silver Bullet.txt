Silver Bullet Lyrics
A few dark words you said to me
I drew a blank and then I flew
I walked the plank into the blue
My heartbeat in leagues of silence

I walked along the coral snow
I saw some lights, an old hotel
The bell was rung, the glasses filled
That cloudy drink that blackens bile

The shade is drawn with stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine and golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning

You said at last, "Let's have a duel
Out by the pines, the day is warm"
I played the fool and when it passed
The gadflies swarmed and then they dined

The shade is drawn with stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine and golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning
The shade is drawn with stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine and golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turning
The shade is drawn with stem and vine
Burned in the flame of a man condemned
With venom wine and golden dawn
A silver bullet in the chamber turningEmbed
