Los Surfers Muertos Lyrics
On a beach near Mexico
Los Surfers Muertos raved
About a break on a shallow cove
The Killer Dana Wave
Los Surfers Muertos
Vivieron antes del puerto
Where she came from
She rode the wave on her long gun

"Just one more ride"
The last words she said
Killer Dana took her life instead
Went overhead
She caught her last big wave
Killer Dana took her life away1Embed
