Shunt Lyrics
This expedition’s gotten way off course
And now you’re asking for a man called horse
And I don’t fit the bill
After stepping on a lockjaw nail
Any remedy is bound to fail
If you don’t take the pill

I wish my head had a tap
And I wish my mind had a drain
So I could shunt my fears away

I’m getting ready for a king-sized poke
About as funny as a punchline joke
I laugh until it hurts
I know you’re hoping for a lead pipe cinch
But I’ve been looking for the right-sized wrench
To throw into the works

I wish my head had a tap
And I wish my mind had a drain
So I could shunt my fears awayEmbed
