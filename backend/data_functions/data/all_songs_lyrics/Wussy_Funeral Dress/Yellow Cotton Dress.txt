Yellow Cotton Dress LyricsThe yellow cotton dress is beautiful no doubt
But it becomes a motherfucker
When you fill it out
The pillow on your side is practically brand new
But it can’t offer comfort to me
Until it smells of you
You’re everywhere
The silverware you used is on the table still
Someone else will have to move it
Because I never will
You’re everywhereEmbed
