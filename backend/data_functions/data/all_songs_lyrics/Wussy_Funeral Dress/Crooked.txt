Crooked Lyrics
This is the night the insects appear
After 17 years on this side of town
Singing the songs they learned underground
They’ve been missing so long
I’m surprised they’re around

It wasn’t meant the way you took it
With all your pictures hanging crooked
But I was glad to see
The look on your face anyway

This is the part where I break you out
And remove any doubt as to which side I’m on
Taking the chance and breaking the glass
And people will talk for years to come

It wasn’t meant the way you took it
With all your pictures hanging crooked
But I was glad to see
The look on your face anywayEmbed
