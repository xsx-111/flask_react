Motorcycle Lyrics
Sixteen motorcycles just today
Wonder what could bring them out this way
And they’re all riding out of town
Looking for the one that turns around

And if they offered I would take it
A free ride out of this place
And I would sit right on the back
Without a helmet on
One day you’ll see

The window can’t afford much company
But you told me you’d be coming back for me
The speed just makes it seem farther away
Sixteen motorcycles just today

And if they offered I would take it
A free ride out of this place
And I would sit right on the back
Without a helmet on
One day you’ll see
He moves in ways that we can’t understand
No one can trace the Lord’s almighty hand
And rapture isn’t what I thought it’d be
But Jesus and his angels ride with me

And if they offered I would take it
A free ride out of this place
And I would sit right on the back
Without a helmet on
One day you’ll seeEmbed
