Conversation Lags Lyrics
The birds along the power lines
Have taken to the air
The cat up in the window looks
But doesn’t seem to care
There wasn’t any warning
And she didn’t pack her bags
But I still miss her singing when
The conversation lags

Come to me you heavy laden
Come to me and I will give you rest

The gravedigger’s sad for all
The things that go unsaid
It’s hard to have a life
When you are living in your head
Now that she is missing
I can see most of the snags
But I still miss her laughing
When the conversation lags

Come to me you heavy laden
Come to me and I will give you restEmbed
