Soak It Up Lyrics
You cut off your hair despite all the warnings
And burned all my letters on your concrete block
I wasn’t there when they found you in the morning
I found a bullet while you were finding God

I’ll take the blame
But drinking’s just too easy
And I can’t soak it up
When the memories start to run
I have a plan that could
Get us to the next town
But I never thought I’d drive this far
Without a gun

When the hurricane came I didn’t board the windows
I knew by the name it was coming for me
I wasn’t there when the sun came in the morning
I never had a reason to stay anyway
I’ll take the shot
Right between the eyes

But I just can’t soak it up
When the memories start to run
I have a plan that could
Get us through the next four summers
I never thought I’d drive this far
Without a gunEmbed
