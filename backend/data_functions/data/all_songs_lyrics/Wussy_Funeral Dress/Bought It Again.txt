Bought It Again LyricsYour heart gave way
And nobody knew
Nobody knew
When the smoke cleared out
There was nobody there but you
You came and showed your
Face around here
Made it perfectly clear
That your heart gave way
But nobody knew
Nobody knew
You severed the brake line
And you bought it again
Bought it again
Got tangled in the lifeline
And you bought it again
Bought it again
I found a way to settle the score
I kicked down the door
By the time you patched it up
I was back for more
To prove to you
That I was sincere
I made it perfectly clear
That my heart gave way
And nobody knew
Nobody knew
I severed the brake line
And bought it again
Bought it again
Got tangled in the lifeline
Fell apart
And bought it again
Bought it againEmbed
