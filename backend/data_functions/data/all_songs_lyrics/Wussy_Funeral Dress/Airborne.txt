Airborne Lyrics
You said that you would call me
And when you didn’t call me
I gave you up for dead
So I was working on a backbone
And chiseling a tombstone
When you called me up and said
Through a wall of heavy breathing
You thought it was relieving
To be out on your own
How a voice that used to thrill me
Could cut me up and kill me
On the fucking telephone

You did not even send me airborne anyway
Why in the world I hung around it’s hard to say

It was just another Thursday
Like any other Thursday
Except that we were through
We were wading through the concrete
And digging through the scrap heap
Deciding what belonged to who
All the treasure from the good days
Was going through the last phase
Of yours and yours and mine
When something from the yours pile
Shattered on the floor tile
And you went off like Frankenstein
You did not even send me airborne anyway
Why in the world I hung around it’s hard to say

I think it’s clear that I adore you
I didn’t mean to bore you
Or grind it in so deep
I had to put another call in
I didn’t think you’d fall in
With the company you keep
And you tell me that you love me
But you don’t really love me
You remind me every day
When you’re living in a flood plain
It doesn’t take a hard rain
To wash it all away

You did not even send me airborne anyway
Why in the world I hung around it’s hard to sayEmbed
