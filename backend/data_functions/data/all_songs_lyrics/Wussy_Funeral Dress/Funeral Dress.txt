Funeral Dress Lyrics
So in order that you look your best
You save you money for a funeral dress
Skipped your dinner when you got the news
Maybe now you can afford the shoes

But you’re alive
Each and every day you’re alive
Counting every second you’re alive
Knowing it’ll never come again

You’ve never run so far from anywhere
You clutched the rail but never left the stairs
Scars are hidden by a plastic ring
Coming home may be the hardest thing

But you’re alive
Each and every day you’re alive
Counting every second you’re alive
Knowing it’ll never come again

You’re feeling poorly but it’s just as well
You love the fabric but you hate the smell
So in order that you look your best
You save your money for a funeral dress
You’re alive
Each and every day you’re alive
Counting every second you’re alive
Knowing it’ll never come againEmbed
