40 Days, 40 Fights LyricsYou look a lot, lot better tonight
You and I should go out for a fight
We need a holiday
But not today another day
You need eyes in the front of your head
And a spine with a built-in bed
I don't want anybody else to know
So I won't be telling them I love you
For all of the things you do
Though I can't even recall your name
There's something beautiful about it though
Well good luck to your lady tonight
I took a piece of her heart well not quite
She stole a piece of mine
And chewed it up and threw it back
I need help to get over the pain
But the memories still remain
I loved her friendly eyes
The way they looked at each other it moves me
To tears like a hall of film
And I don't even recall her name
There's something beautiful about it though
Now there's a good good feeling tonight
Just a feeling that something is right
We can minimalize the pain
Forget that it was ever there
Look at all the possibles
Throw answers out to the world
Its hard its hard its hard
Its hard its hard its hard
Its hard when you don't know how
But I'll be here to throw you some clues
Don't even have to know your name
Something beautiful about it though
Something beautiful about it though
Forty days and forty fights
Forty days and forty fightsEmbed
