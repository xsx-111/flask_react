All Possibilities LyricsAll possibilities
Are landing at my feet
There's nothing I can see
But possibilities
All colours are changing in my eyes
Your hopes are all fading, that will never do
You're seeing the world through cynical eyes
I'm seeing the world through the eyes of somebody new
Oh there's a hope left, there's a dream still in my heart
Look past the answers, there's a chance that there's no rulebook for this love
All possibilities
Are landing at my feet
There's nothing I can see
But possibilities
All the colours are changing in my eyes
Your hopes are all fading, that will never do
You're seeing the world through cynical eyes
I'm seeing the world through the eyes of somebody new
Oh there's a hope left, there's a dream still in my heart
Look past the answers, there's a chance that there's no rulebook for this loveEmbed
