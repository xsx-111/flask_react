Tickets to What You Need LyricsI'm turning the lights down low
Ready to make my move
Get you tickets to what you need
I'm treading the borderlines
And ruining people's lives by giving them what they need
You're quite right to ask what's wrong with me
You want to take a look at my head
Even I've been thinking what's wrong with me
I watch the news instead
I'm turning Madonna down
I'm calling it my best move
I'll get her tickets to what she needs
I'm hugging my eiderdown
Employing a microscope
To find you the things you need
Now I'm ready to tell you what's wrong with me
I'm feeling the emptiness rise
And I'd trade the whole thing quite gladly
For something of similar size
Shape, colour, weight, change your shirt, don't be late
I'm turning the lights down low
Ready to make my move
Get you tickets to what you need
What's wrong with me, What's wrong with me?
What's wrong with me, What's wrong with me?Embed
