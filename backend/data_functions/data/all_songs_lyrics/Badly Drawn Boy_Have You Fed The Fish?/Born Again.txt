Born Again LyricsMaybe there's a reason why I'm born again
There's something rare going on under my skies
You got to chill out, find a reason for your soul again
And judge the miracle by feel, not size
Infinite the reasons why I'm born again
The modern innocents have soul on their side
Try to capture reasons why I'm born again
The more I look at it the less that I find
But I won't bail out, there'll be a reason for my soul again
Another miracle has seasoned my mind
Maybe there's a reason why I'm born again
There's something real going on under my skies
I'm born again
My soul again
I'm born again
Find my soul again
Born again
Born again
Find my soul again
And I'm born again
My soul again
Born again, born again, born again, born againEmbed
