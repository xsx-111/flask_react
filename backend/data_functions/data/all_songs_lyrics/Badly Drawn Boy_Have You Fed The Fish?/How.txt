How LyricsWhat if, there is, nothing else for us after all this
I don't care, I don't mind just as long as we find some time
Just come back and stay
Out of my way and be all the things you need
And all the love to feel
How can I be sure, again once more...
How can I find time , to be with you ... again ...
How can I give you the answers you need, when all I posses is a melody
How can I take up the air that you breath, when all I posses is a melody
How can I be sure ... again ... once more
I don't care, I don't mind, Just as long as we find some time
When you come back, I'll go ... out of my way to be all the things you need
And all the love to feel
How can I give you the answers you need, when all I posses is a melody
How can I take up the air that you breath, when all I posses is a melody
How can I find time, to be with you ... again ...
When you come back I'll go, out of my to be all the things you need
And all the love to feelEmbed
