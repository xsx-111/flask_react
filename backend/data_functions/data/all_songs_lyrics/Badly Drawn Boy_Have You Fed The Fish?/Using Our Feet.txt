Using Our Feet LyricsAnything you're not sure of?
People meet me ask if I got the money to lend her
Find her, tell her she is still on the agenda
Pretty soon we'll be dancing
We'll be using our feet
Just like we always had it easy
Just like we always knew we'd meet
Anything you're not sure of?
People who see me think I vibe on the attention
I just think they're hoping that they'll be getting a mention
But I don't know what their chance is
Of ever finding their feet
And if they know what to dance is
The kind of people I don't meet
After this song I will be earning a fat cent
I'll be working on my American accent
And pretty soon we'll be dancing
Yeah, we'll be using our feet
Just like we knew it'd be easy
Just like we always knew we'd meetEmbed
