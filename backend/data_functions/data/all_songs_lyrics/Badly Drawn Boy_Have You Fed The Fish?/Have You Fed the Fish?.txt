Have You Fed the Fish? LyricsThe keys to your heart
Open the door to the world
You've got to give me two days
And woman, I'll make you a girl
Sometimes you've got to
Rewind, to go forward
There's some
Good times, around the corner
But have you fed the fish today?
Have you made your wish today?
I need a new eiderdown
I want some binoculaurs
Don't want to be obvious
I want to surprise myself
I've killed all the mockingbirds
I've wrestled the octopus
I came out with extra arms
To carry your baggage
Sometimes you've got to
Rewind, to go forward
There's some
Good times, around the corner
But have you fed the fish today?
Have you made your wish today?Embed
