What Is It Now? LyricsSo now that life will never be the same
We've got to face the thought of loneliness again
Try and get inside your lover's brain
Dragging old romance from dirty ditch and then
So what is it now that it can't be made to feel right?
Don't answer now
I know somehow we'll be alright
Level out and help us find a place
You've got to see the sights from somewhere else again
(Yeah)
The modern innocents have changed the pace
They've got to know it's all been answered incidentally
So what is it now that it can't be made to feel right?
Don't answer now
I know somehow we'll be alright
So now that life will never be the same
We've got to face the thought of loneliness again
You know we'll be alright...
So what is it now that it can't be made to feel right?
Don't answer now
I know somehow we'll be alright
Yeah what is it now that it can't be made to feel right?
Don't answer now
I know somehow we'll be alright
Well now that life will never be the same
We've got to face the thought of loneliness againEmbed
