Bedside Story LyricsGoodnight my answer, your dreams are still sweet
Goodnight, be careful with yourself
Don't worry about the money, forget about the wealth
You'll be my angel, divert me from hell
Help me, protect me from myself
Don't worry, don't worry
Goodnight my answer, goodnight my answer
Goodnight my answer
Goodnight my answer
Goodnight my answerEmbed
