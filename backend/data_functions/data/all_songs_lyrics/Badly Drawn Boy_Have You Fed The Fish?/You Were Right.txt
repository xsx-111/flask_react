You Were Right LyricsAnd you, were right to bide your time and not buy into my misery
Well the good things are never free
Do the colours of the rainbow look the same to everyone
And I, was rushin' round in circles for a reason to believe
Wipe the slime from of your sleeve
You could follow me for weeks and i'm not goin' anywhere
Sometimes it's hard to love someone
Until the day that they are gone
And I, just had a dream the other night
I was married to the Queen
And Madonna lived next door
I think she took a shine to me
And the kids were all grown up
But I had to turn her down coz I was still in love with you
I'm turnin' Madonna down
I'm callin' it my best move
I'll get a ticket to what you need
I, remember doin' nothin' on the night Sinatra died
And the night Jeff Buckley died
And the night Kurt Cobain died
And the night John Lennon died
I remember I stayed up to watch the news with everyone
And that was a lot of nights
And that was a lot of lives
They lost the tickets to what they need
And I, was busy findin' answers while you just got on with real life
Always hoped you'd be my wife
But I never found the time
For the question to arrive
I just disguised it in this song
And songs, are never quite the answer
Just a soundtrack to a life
That is over all too soon
Helps to turn the days to night
While I was wrong and you were right
And this was a lesson learned
I'm happy to be your fool
And get you tickets to what you need
I'm turnin' the lights down low
I'm ready to make my move
I'll get you tickets to what you need1Embed
