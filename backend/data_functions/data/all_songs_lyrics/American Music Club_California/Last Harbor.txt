Last Harbor LyricsSome of them are kind and it's phony
Some of them are kind and it's okay
Generous but where's the charity
To lose or give away
Some of them smile and it's phony
Some of them smile and it's not
Some of them never tell you
Just how much love they've got
Falling, falling
Hey, I don't see the bottom
Are you gonna be my last harbor?
She'll soon find a way to make you feel fine
She's laughing and she's clapping her hands
As she walks across your cup of wine
She'll make it real easy for you
All you have to do is remember her name
She's almost your passport to the world
She's almost your ticket out again
Falling, falling
Hey, I don't see the bottom
Are you gonna be my last harbor?
Are you gonna be my last harâ€“harbor?
Some of them smile and it's phony
Some of them smile and it's okay
Some of them never tell you
Just how much love they'll give awayEmbed
