Lonely LyricsWell you don't want me to touch you
You just want me to shut up
You don't want me to think what I'm thinking
Or the devil in my throat to come up
And you get so nervous that everything's a joke
If I have to be this lonely
If I have to be this lonely
If I have to be this lonely
I may as well be alone
So I go back to my room
To my room by the freeway
I fall onto my bed like snow
Like the cold I never woke you
And a killer followed me home
"Hey what song you whistling?"
If I have to be this lonely
If I have to be this lonely
If I have to be this lonely
I may as well be alone, yeah
When you wake up in the morning
You won't remember that anyone was here
And my life is so rewarding
And I guess that you're the grand prize my dear
When you wake up in the morning
You won't remember that anyone was here
If I have to be this lonely
If I have to be this lonely
If I have to be this lonely
If I have to be this lonely
If I have to be this lonely
I may as well be alone
If I have to be this lonelyEmbed
