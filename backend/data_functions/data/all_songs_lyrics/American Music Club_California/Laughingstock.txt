Laughingstock LyricsLaughing stock proves that the world is made of rock
That some grow happily on, but that's hard for some
That's hard for some
You and your friend and all the rest of God's sweet children
Never weak, always strong
That's hard for some, that's hard for some
You ask me why
You ask me why
You're just a couple of strangers in a bar
Giving me the chance to explain myself away
Some entertainment to give away
In your eyes I see the rest of life just passes by, just passes by
And that's hard for some
You ask me why
You ask me why
You ask me why, that's your alibi
Isn't everything clear
Isn't everything clear
Isn't everything clear
No clouds in the sky
No clouds in the sky
The laughing stock proves that the world is made of rock
That's hard for some
That's hard for someEmbed
