Pale Skinny Girl LyricsPale and skinny girl lives in the middle of a mountain
Long golden hair, someone pull her out
She walks across a parking lot
With two quarters in her hand
She just wants to take a little break from nothing
Never sees, never sees daylight
Never needs, never needs daylight
Outside the air pocket, there's no one around
She's frozen with terror like an animal
Baby take your first walk out into the wasteland
On every horizon, nothing
Never needs, never needs daylight
Never needs, never needs daylight
Never sees daylight
Never needs, never needs daylight
Never, never needs, never needs daylight
 dragging furniture across the parking lot
