Jenny LyricsHere you are again
Another stupid party again
A celebration for nothing
Your eyes are following
The kings and the queens of the zoo
Immune in their black clothing
They let the world down
And they let you
And they let you go
Please don't go home now
Home is a place to rob
Home is alone in a mob
Home is an unheard sob
Jenny don't go
Jenny don't go home now
Please don't you go home now
Here you are again
Another stupid party again
Everyone here thinks that when they die
You will be there to let them in
Jenny don't go
Please don't go home now
Please don't you go home now
Jenny don't go home nowEmbed
