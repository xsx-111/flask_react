Somewhere LyricsWell she's all dressed up and waiting for a bus in the hot sunshine
She just wants to kill some time but it looks like time's gonna kill her first
And so she goes to the cocktail lounge to lounge and says
"I'm gonna have a real good time."
As she sinks into the capitalist chair
I don't think that she really cares
If somewhere, somewhere, oh somewhere there's people living
She finally gets on the bus and sinks next to a very nice lady
Who just got out of the hospital, she had a major operation
The doctor left a knife in her throat and now it picks up radio waves
You can turn the dial 'til it comes up in your hand
Maybe you'll pick up a populated land
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere
There's people living
There's people living
C'mon let's go out and really drunk tonight
You can be Miss Bottomless Pit of 1983
And I can be Mr. Out Like a Light
C'mon we got a lot to lose
So maybe we can lose it all tonight
And then when they shoot us down
Well we won't be around
We'll be somewhere, we'll be somewhere, oh somewhere
Where there's people living
Yeah somewhere, oh somewhere, I'm sure somewhere
Where there's people living, there's people livingEmbed
