Blue and Grey Shirt LyricsI sat up all morning and I waited for you
With my blue and grey shirt on
Yeah, I thought that's my lucky one
And I'll sit and face the road now
I don't have a heavy load now
I got nothing to keep my hanging around here
From now on, from now on
Where's the compassion to make your tired heart sing?
'Cause I'm tired of being a spokesman for every tired thing
There's nothing in the world outside
Just some things that I can see from the side
I'm just a shy boy sitting in a house when everyone is gone
From now on, from now on
I sat up all morning and I waited for you
With my blue and grey shirt on
Yeah, that's my favorite one
I sat up all morning, so why didn't you come?
Because now I just sing my songs for people that are gone
From now on
From now on
From now on
From now onEmbed
