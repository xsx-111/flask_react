Bad Liquor LyricsBad liquor, bad liquor
Who took the good end of the bottle
Salt water, salt water
Dragged  across the floor
The moon, that little moon
It's the saddest bugger of them all
Bad liquor, bad liquor
At the bottom of Niagara Falls
Whatcha doin' here bitch?
You wanna have some fun?
Whatcha doin' here bitch?
You wanna have some fun?
Whatcha doin' here bitch?
Well I'm the evil one
Whatcha doin' here bitch?
Well I'm the evil one
Bad liquor, bad liquor
It's pulling my strings tonight
Salt water, salt water
There's nothing that I do right
And all you people, you people
You're the luckiest people of all
Bad liquor, bad liquor
At the bottom of Niagara Falls
Whatcha doin' here bitch?
You wanna have some fun?
Bad luck
You wanna have some fun?
No way
You wanna have some fun?
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Sorry, not here
Unless you got another couple bucks
Sit down, come here
Bad liquor, bad liquor
It's pulling my strings tonight
Salt water, salt water
There's nothing that I do rightEmbed
