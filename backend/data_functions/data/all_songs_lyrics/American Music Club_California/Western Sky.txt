Western Sky LyricsTime for me to go away
I'll get a new name, I'll get a new face
Time for me to go away
No, I don't belong in this place
But I'm not gonna ask you why
You think the parade has passed you by
Or if everything good is gone into the western sky
I hate to see you look that way
All the beauty has left your face
That's such an easy thing to give away
That's impossible to replace
So I'll take you in my two weak hands
And I'll throw you so high
Watch you fall forever in the western sky
And when you land then you'll turn into some kind of prize
Into somebody's sweet prize
I won't see you no more
Mmm, who am I to rate that high?
The world's a shadow of what went before
The world gives off none of its own light
So please be happy baby
And please don't cry
Even though the parade has passed us by
Well you can still see it shining in the western sky
In the western sky
You can still see it shining
You can still see it shining
You can still see it shining
So why won't you stop crying?
You can still see it shiningEmbed
