Scraped Lyrics
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you

Sometimes I feel like the world is on top of me
Breaking me down with an endless monotony
Sometimes I feel like there's nothing that's stopping me
All things are possible, I am unstoppable
Some may convince you, no one can break through
I'm here to tell you you're worth more than they tell you

(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you

Sometimes I feel like my life's a catastrophe
Can't understand why it seems like it has to be
Sometimes I feel like it's all opened up for me
Nothing's impossible, I am unconquerable
No one can make you do what they want to
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you


Some may convince you, no one can break through
You know you're stronger than the lies that they tell you

(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) I just refuse
(Ay-oh) Don't you try to stop us now
(Ay-oh) 'Cause I just won't let you1Embed
