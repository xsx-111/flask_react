Iris LyricsI liked the way my hand looked on your head
In the presence of my knuckles
But the beauty of this vision alone, just like yesterday's sunset
Has been perverted by the sentimental and mistaken for love
The Felix of your truth will always break it (Break it)
And the iris of your eye, always shake it (Shake it)
And the armies, the armies I have created will always hate it, always bait you on
I liked the way my hand looked on your head
In the presence of my struggle
But the beauty of this vision alone, I can't shake from my tree just yet
It keeps invading all my private moments
Listen to me now
The Felix of your truth will always break it (Break it)
And the iris of your eye, always shake it (Shake it, break it)
And the armies, the armies I have created (Created, created)
Will always hate it, always bait you on
C’mon, until I take care of pride
Until I see their flags
C’mon, until I take care of pride
Until I see their flags
Until I see their flags
And deep inside my pain
Until I see their flags
The Felix of your truth will always break it
And the iris of your eye, always shake it
And the armies I, the armies I, I have created will always hate it
Will always bait you on until I take their flagsEmbed
