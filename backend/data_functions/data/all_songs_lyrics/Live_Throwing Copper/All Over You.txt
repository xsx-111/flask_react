All Over You LyricsOur love is like water
Pinned down and abused for being strange
Our love is no other
Than me alone, for me all day
Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused, ayy
All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now, lay me down
Oh, yeah
Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused for being strange
Our love is no other
Than me alone, for me all day
Our love is like angels
Pinned down and abused, ayy
All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now
Lay me down
Pay me now, pay me now
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
All over you, all over me
All over you, all over me
Pay me now
Lay me down, down
Pay me now, pay me now
Lay me down, lay me down, lay
Our love is like water
Pinned down and abused for being strange
Our love is no other
Than me alone, hey
All over you, all over me
The sun, the fields, the sky
I've often tried to hold the sea
The sun, the fields, the tide
Pay me now
Lay me down, down
Pay me now, pay me now
Lay me down, lay me down, lay1Embed
