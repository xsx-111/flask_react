Horse LyricsAll the things that they make you say
And all of the love that you hide away
I'll pick you up and it will be all right
I'll pick you up and it will be tonight
She rode a horse into my head
She won't discipline the children
And now they're running wild on the beach
And I don't care
Oh, I don't care
No I don't care hey, hey, hey
It's the middle of the night and you're here
Playing dominoes and drinking beer
I tried to think of something deep to say
But my well is dripping dry today, hey
Hey, hey, heyEmbed
