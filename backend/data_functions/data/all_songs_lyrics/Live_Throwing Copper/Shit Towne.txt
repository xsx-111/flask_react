Shit Towne LyricsThe weavers live up the street from me
The crackheads, they live down the street from me
The tall grass makes it hard to see
Beyond my property
Hey man, this is criminal
This hard line symmetry of people and pets
And we don't bother anyone
We keep to ourselves
The mailman visits each of us in turn
And we don't bother anyone
We keep to ourselves
The mailman visits each of us in time
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In shit town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In our town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In shit town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
The weavers live up the street from me
The crackheads, they live down the street from me
And we don't bother anyone
We keep to ourselves
The mailman visits each of us in turn
And we don't bother anyone
We keep to ourselves
The mailman visits each of us in time
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In shit town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In our town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In shit town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In our town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
Do me wrong
Do me wrong
Do me wrong
Don't hold me back
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In shit town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In our town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
In shit town
Gotta live, gotta live, gotta live
Our town
Shit town
Our town
Shit town
Our town
