Selling the Drama Lyrics
And to love, the God
And to fear, the flame
And to burn, the crowd that has a name

And to right or wrong
And to meek or strong
It is known, just scream it from the wall

I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before

Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that

It's the sun that burns
It's the wheel that turns
It's the way we sing that makes 'em dream
And to Christ, a cross
And to me, a chair
I will sit and earn the ransom from up here

I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before

Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that, scarred like that
(We won't, we won't, we won't, we won't)

And to love, a God
And to fear, a flame
And to burn, a love that has a name

I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that
Hey, now we won't be raped
Hey, now we won't be scarred like that, scarred like that

Hey, now, no, no
We won't be scarred like that
Wow we won't be scarred like that7Embed
