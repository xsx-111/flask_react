Top Lyrics
This is not helping me at all, what you are doing here
In the name of God and love, with the distribution of fear
Pyramids, healing wines, analysts with fame
I haven't got your degree and I forgot your name

Pick me up and put me on the ground
Set me up and spin me all around
No, you are not the one
You are not the one
No, sir

This is not helping me at all, where did we get this plan?
That you could give to me what I might already have
Pyramids, healing wines, a musician's fame
I've volunteered you my eyes in place of facing me

Pick me up and put me on the ground
Set me up and spin me all around
No, you are not the one
You are not the one
Pick me up and put me on the ground
Set me up and spin me all around
You are not the one
You are not the one I wished to see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, Hitler, in a robe of truth
My emptiness has built your altar
And I've worshipped myself in you forever
Until now

Pick me up
Set me up
Pick me up
Don't set me up
You are not the one, no, no
You are not the one I wished to see, yeah (Pick me up)
I wished to see, oh (Set me up)
I wished to see (Pick me up)
Yeah, I wished to see (Set me up)
We need love, not leadersEmbed
