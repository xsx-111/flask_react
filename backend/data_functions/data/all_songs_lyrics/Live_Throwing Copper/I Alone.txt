I Alone Lyrics
It's easier not to be wise
And measure these things by your brains
I sank into Eden with you
Alone in the church by and by
I'll read to you here, save your eyes
You'll need them, your boat is at sea
Your anchor is up, you've been swept away
And the greatest of teachers won't hesitate
To leave you there, by yourself, chained to fate

I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
Fear is not the end of this
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you

It's easier not to be great
And measure these things by your eyes
We long to be here by his resolve
Alone in the church by and by
To cradle the baby in space
And leave you there by yourself chained to fate, yeah
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
Fear is not the end of this
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you

Oh, now, we took it back too far
Only love can save us now
All these riddles that you burn
All come runnin' back to you
All these rhythms that you hide
Only love can save us now
All these riddles that you burn yeah, yeah, yeah

I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
Fear is not the end of this
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you
I alone love you
I alone tempt you
I alone love you4Embed
