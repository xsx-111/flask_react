T.B.D. LyricsIn the moment I was losing my head
Readin' too much and losin' my head and I was
Reachin' forward, I was already there
Readin' too much and losin' my head
This information caused a cut in the line
Now I'm remembering God and readin' too much
It's so nice
The print is smaller than the ants in the grass
I'll have to put it away now
In the morning there are things to be read
Words to be said, and food to be fed
But I won't be there
I'll be clutchin' on a megaphone pointed at my head
Would you be there
Would you kindly, read this word for word
So loud and clear
I can't remember it all
It needs to be clear, I tell you
If the feeling drops out of your voice
Would you kindly pick it up
This is how, I'll go out tonight
Dressed in blue, by the book tonight
This is how, I'll go out tonight
But I don't need a book
We're talkin' anchors, talkin' ships, we're talkin' seas
We're talkin' everything you need
You should be workin' now
Not only askin' how
And the whereabouts of where you'll be
I don't suspect you will be thinking
When the brain is dead
And the mind has taken over
This is a skill, this is not a game
Where have you been
Are you with us?
Can you hear us?
Got the megaphone pointed at youEmbed
