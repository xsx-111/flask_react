Waitress LyricsCome on baby leave some change behind
She was a bitch, but I don't care
She brought our food out on time
And wore a funky barrette in her hair
Come on baby leave some change behind
She was a bitch but good enough
To leave some change
Everybody's good enough for some change
The girl's got family
She needs cash
To buy aspirin for her pain
Everybody's good enough for some change
Some fucking change!
Come on baby leave some change behind
She was a bitch, but I don't care
She brought our food out on time
And wore a funky barrette in her hair
Come on baby leave some change behind
She was a bitch but good enough
To leave some change
Everybody's good enough for some change
We all get the flu
We all get aids
We've got to stick together, after all
Everybody's good enough for some change
Some fucking change!
Come on baby!
Oooh! Oooh!
