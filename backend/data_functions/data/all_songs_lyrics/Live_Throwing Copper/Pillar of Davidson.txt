Pillar of Davidson LyricsWarm bodies I sense
Are not machines that can only make money
Past perfect tense
Words for a feeling in all I've discovered
I'll be along son
With medicine supposed to designed to
Make you high
I'll be along son
With words for a feeling in all I've discovered
Old bad eyes
Old bad eyes
Old bad eyes
All loneliness comes
Go see the foreman go see the profiteer
All loneliness drives
We're takin' our time movin' shit for
This holy slime
Old, bad eyes
Old, bad eyes
Old, bad eyes, almighty fear
The shepherd won't leave me alone
He's in my face at night
The shepherd of my days
And I want you here by my heart
And my head, I can't start till I'm dead


Here I am locking horns with the stallion
Failing to hold my head up I go back again
Pillar of Davidson feeling too hard to go down
Cheaper than all the souls he will walk upon
Deeper and deeper and closer I hold my head up
Cheaper than all the souls he will walk upon
Pillar of Davidson feeling too hard to go downEmbed
