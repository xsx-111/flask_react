The Dam at Otter Creek LyricsWhen all that's left to do
Is reflect on what's been done
This is where sadness breathes
The sadness of everyone
Just like when the guys built the dam at Otter Creek
And all the water backed up
Deep enough to dive
We took the dead man in sheets to the river
Flanked by love
Deep enough to dive
Deep enough to dive
Oh, be here now
Oh, be here now
Oh, be here now
Oh, be here now
Saw the guys who built the dam at Otter Creek
And all the water backed up, backed up, backed up
Deep enough to dive
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We took him free and a three
In a stretcher made from trees
That had passed in the storm
Leave the hearse behind
To leave the curse behind
Oh, be here now
Oh, be here now
Oh, be here now
Oh, be here now, yeah
Oh, be here now
We took the dead man in sheets to the river
Flanked by love
We took the dead man in sheets to the river
Flanked, oh yeah
Oh, be here now
Oh, be here now
Oh, be here now, yeah
Oh, be here now, yeah
Oh, be here
We took the dead man in sheets to the river
Flanked by the river, flanked by the river
By love
Flanked by love
Flanked by love, yeah
Flanked by love, yeahEmbed
