Wolfman Jack Lyrics
Ooh, woo!
Yeah!
Hey baby, you're on a subliminal trip to nowhere
You better get your trip together before you step in here with us

Full moon tonight, everything's all right
Baby come on back to Wolfman Jack
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)

If you want yourself a day man, well I don't mind
You just ditch him when the sun goes down
'Cause the moon shines bright and everything's all right
When the Wolfman, he creeps into town

Now you'll maybe want a man who throws 'round his money
But he ain't as cool as Wolfman Jack
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)
You might want yourself a man who don't act so funny
But he ain't your fool like Wolfman Jack
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)

I don't mean to treat you evil
I'm just a good boy gone bad
But if I catch you after dark walking through the park
I'm just liable to do something mad
You maybe think you know what love is about, girl
But it's nothing till it's Wolfman Jack
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)
And everybody knows you go 'round and shout it
Your only thrill is Wolfman Jack, woo!
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)

Full moon tonight, everything's all right
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)
I may miss your loving while I'm on my back
But you can't escape from Wolfman Jack
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)
You can't do this to me
(Full moon tonight, everything's all right)
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)
No, no, woo!

Look me in the eyes, baby, now you cut that jive
You know the Wolfman's just about the number one cat alive
You've got my great big eyes spinning 'round in my head
(How could you love another man instead?)
You can't do this to me
(Full moon tonight, everything's all right)
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)
I may miss your loving while I'm on my back
But you can't escape from Wolfman Jack, no, no
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)
(Full moon tonight, everything's all right)
Can't escape from Jack, no, no
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)
This lady's Wolfman Jack's, oh, no, yeah, no, oh
(Full moon tonight, everything's all right)
(Baby come back to Wolfman Jack)...Embed
