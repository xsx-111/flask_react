The Night the Carousel Burned Down LyricsWeren't you there when the carousel burnt down?
The fire and confusion, the smoke and the sound
I swear you there when the carousel burnt down
We were all around
The rings charred and tarnished all over the ground
And our heads hung down
And we all left town the next day
The children all cried when the carousel burnt down
The old ladies sighed when the carousel burnt down
The rest of us lied as the carousel burnt down
And the flames did fly
The pipes steamed and shrieked out a blazing goodbye
As the boiler died
And they melted down the midway
And we all left town the next day
And we all left town the next day (we all left town the very next day)

And we all left town the next day
And we all left town the next day (we all left town the very next day)
And we all left town (we all left town, we all left town, we all left town the very next day)
The next dayEmbed
