One More Day (No Word) Lyrics
One more day
They said we'd be home for Christmas but I'm still here today
One more day
I went to see the first lieutenant
He said shut up and wait
One more day, no word
Ooh, one more day, no word

One more day
We don't pick no more trees 'til the union okay
One more day
If they don't get a contract soon then I don't think we can stay
One more day, no word
Ooh, one more day, no word

All alone
All my friends are gone
Ears of stone, eyes gone blind
Too little to do and too much time
One more day, no word
Ooh, one more day, no word
One more day
I haven't seen my girl in a year last July
One more day
She hasn't even written a letter but I try not to cry
One more day, no word
Ooh, one more day, no word

All alone
All my friends are gone
Ears of stone, eyes gone blind
Too little to do and too much time

One more day, no word
Ooh, one more day, no word
Ooh, one more day, no word
Ooh, one more day, no word
Doesn't anybody know I'm alive (ooh, one more day, no word)
I just don't think I can survive (ooh, one more day, no word)
One more day, no word (ooh, one more day, no word)
Another day has gone byEmbed
