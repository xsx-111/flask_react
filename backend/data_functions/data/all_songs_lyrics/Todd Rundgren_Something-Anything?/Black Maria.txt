Black Maria Lyrics
Black Maria, you scare me so
I feel as though my heart stop dead
You're a liar, this I know
I watch you go around my head

Oh, I'm going down slow
You scare me so
Oh, you never let go
You scare me so

Gay deceiver, my eyes they burned
My insides turned, my brain it rolled
Unbeliever, but now I've learned
I took my turn, I come up cold

Oh, I'm going down slow
You scare me so
Oh, you never let go
You scare me so

If you must kill me
Please let me die, Lord
(Let me die, let me die)

(Ooh) Black Maria, you scare me so
I feel as though my heart stop dead
You're a liar, this I know
I watch you go around my head

Oh, I'm going down slow
You scare me so
Oh, you never let go
You scare me so

If you must kill me
Please let me dieEmbed
