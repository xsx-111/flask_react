Marlene Lyrics
Marlene, Marlene
You're the prettiest girl I've ever seen
Do you care for me at all, Marlene?
I care for you
And I just don't care who knows it
And I guess that means that I love you

Marlene (Marlene), Marlene (Marlene)
Who'd believe that you're only seventeen?
I'm in trouble if your folks get mean
And if they do
Then I don't care if they bust me
And I guess that means that I love you

I don't need no fantasies
Just one thing I need
If you could make it here, Marlene
Dear Marlene

Marlene (Marlene), Marlene (Marlene)
When I think that it all is just a dream
I remember that your eyes are green
And mine are blue
They will always see each other
And I guess that means that I love you
I don't need realities
Just one thing I need
If you could make it here, Marlene
Dear Marlene

Marlene, Marlene
I'm depending on you now, Marlene (Marlene)
I'm depending on you now, Marlene (Marlene)
I'm depending on you now, Marlene (Marlene)
I'm depending on you now, Marlene (Marlene)
I'm depending on you now, Marlene (Marlene)Embed
