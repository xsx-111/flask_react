Piss Aaron LyricsIf it's stupid enough, it's cool
One, two, ah-one, two, three

We figure, my daddy and me
Things are still the same, it seems
As when he lived it in his teens as a kid in school
Aaron was a junior, the class of '32
His momma called him angel but everybody knew he was the
King king, the gross out king

They called him Piss Aaron
They always caught him pissin' in the hall
Piss Aaron, he never would refuse when nature called

Dumb Larry from Homeroom 9
Kept his locker full of weeds
Just to satisfy his smoking needs and his love of fire
Went to a game and lit a stink bomb in the bleachers
The coach, the cheerleader and the chem teacher, and the
The dean dean, duh, dean dean dean was after

Dumb Larry, they always caught him smokin' in the john
Dumb Larry, you never would have missed him when he's gone
Chuck Biscuits, conservative jive
The biggest pig in all the school
He would sit and smack his lips and drool as he eyed your lunch
I left a bag in his desk one night
A raw egg sandwich and when Hungry took a bite he had to
Up chuck, uh up up chuck, a-pukin'

Chuck Biscuits, they always caught him eatin' in the class
Dumb Larry, they always caught him smokin' in the john
Piss Aaron, they always caught him pissin' in the hall1Embed
