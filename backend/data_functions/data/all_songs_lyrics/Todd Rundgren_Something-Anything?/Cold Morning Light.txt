Cold Morning Light Lyrics
I believe if I was all alone
I would be better off in a world my own
I'd forget I ever knew of you
And this dream every night that you put me through

We walk along a Hollywood sea
And you dance once again with me

We are close, we are friends
And our love never ends
But in the cold morning light I see
That you won't be back for me

The wound you left is healing and then
It starts itching and I scratch it open again
So the pain comes out and I give in
And indulge my imaginations, whims

We sit and drink Victorian tea
And your face wears a smile for me
I was yours, you were mine
Our hearts bound, lost in time
But in the cold morning light I see
That you won't be back

For me there can be no peace
For me there can be no rest
I believe though I've tried my best
I'm condemned it seems
To a life of restlessness and hopeless dreams

We are close, we are friends
And our love never ends
But in the cold morning light I see
That you won't be back for meEmbed
