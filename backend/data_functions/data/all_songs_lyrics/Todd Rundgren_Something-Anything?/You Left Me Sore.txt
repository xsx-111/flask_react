You Left Me Sore Lyrics
Love is infectious and I was a victim
The worst case you'd ever see
But still I know no doctor or nurse
Could cure what you gave to me

'Cause you really, you left me sore
(You left me sore)
You really left me sore now baby
(You left me sore)
You messed me up for sure and I don't mean maybe
'Cause you really left me sore

You didn't tell me and I didn't ask
So there's nobody left to blame
But still I know no place I can go
That helps to relieve the pain

'Cause you really, you left me sore
(You left me sore)
You really left me sore now baby
(You left me sore)
You messed me up for sure and I don't mean maybe
'Cause you really left me sore

But now I know no good ever comes
From love on a one night stand

'Cause you really, you left me sore
(You left me sore)
You really left me sore now baby
(You left me sore)
You messed me up for sure and I don't mean maybe
'Cause you really left me sore
You really, you left me sore
(You left me sore)
You really left me sore now baby
(You left me sore)
You messed me up for sure and I don't mean maybe
'Cause you really left me sore
