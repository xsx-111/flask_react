Little Red Lights Lyrics
You got to ease into line, boy
But once I hit the open road
I'll be sailing off and on my own

You and me in my GT
With those little red lights in front of me
When I go to heaven, you know that's where I want to be

Would you please fill it up, boy
I'd like to stop and catch myself a bite
But I sure hate to leave the road tonight

You and me in my GT
With those little red lights in front of me
When I go to heaven, you know that's where I want to be
Woah


And when I'm racing the clock
You know that I would die or kill somebody
Just to move this hunk of steel one more block
You and me in my GT
With those little white lines in front of me
When I go to heaven, you know that's where I want to be

I think I see a little red light in my rear view mirrorEmbed
