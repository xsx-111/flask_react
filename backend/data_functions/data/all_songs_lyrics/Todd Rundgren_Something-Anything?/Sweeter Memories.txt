Sweeter Memories Lyrics
There's a cloud in the sky
And it's raining on you
Still you try to keep dry
But your troubles leak through

And you've lost all you could, feeling sad
Choose your reveries
Keep the good, leave the bad

Take a few of these, the sweeter memories
Don't forget them please, the sweeter memories
Set your mind at ease, the truest remedies
Are the sweeter memories

There's a life full of pain
And a life full of glee
So you see that the rain
Doesn't mean much to me

For I know that it pays
Making light of living's tragedies
Make your days be as bright
Take a few of these, the sweeter memories
Don't forget them please, the sweeter memories
The truest remedies to set your mind at ease
Are the sweeter memoriesEmbed
