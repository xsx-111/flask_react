Some Folks Is Even Whiter Than Me LyricsThere goes Todd
Yipes!
Rolling on 10, 11

There ain't a man alive today
Who doesn't want to have the world in his hand
And everything to go his way
And abuse what he don't understand
Some people never can be satisfied
'Less they push somebody else around
But I can't give no aid or take no side
I just watch them drag each other down because

Some folks is even whiter than me
Some folks is even blacker than me
I got myself caught in the middle somewhere
And that's just where I want to be

I'm talking 'bout the outside
Talking 'bout your inside too
I'm talking 'bout the outside
Talking 'bout your inside, talkin' 'bout your inside too


I spent a lot of time alone
And when I'm gone you won't remember my name
But I ain't never been nobody's boss but my own
And I hope that you can say the same
And I feel just like everyone around
I like so sing my songs of change like a crooner
But if we was all to live another mile uptown
I think we'd like to get it changed a whole lot sooner

Some folks is even whiter than me
Some folks is even blacker than me
I got myself caught in the middle somewhere
And I don't know where I want to be

I'm talking 'bout the outside
Talking 'bout your inside too
I'm talking 'bout your outside
Talking 'bout your inside tooEmbed
