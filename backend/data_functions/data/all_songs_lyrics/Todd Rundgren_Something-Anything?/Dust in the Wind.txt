Dust in the Wind LyricsHere we go
Comin' at ya

Tell everyone that I am sorry, truly sorry
For all of the wrongs I done
I never meant to hurt nobody, no
Lord, I never want to do no wrong

But I have lied, I have begged and I have cheated
And I know my ship won't be coming in
As I lay me down to take my rest
I see that it's just dust in the wind

Take hold my hand, hold it tighter, ever tighter
You must believe that I love you still
But my strength, it grows weaker, ever weaker
And my body has lost it's will

Now I have lied, I have begged and I have cheated
And I know my ship won't be coming in
As I lay me down to take my rest
I see that it's just dust in the wind


Oh my Lord, I have lost once again
And I got no one to help me find my way
But I never wanted to hurt nobody
And I never wanted to do no wrong

I have lied, I have begged and I have cheated
And I know my ship won't be coming in
As I lay me down to take my rest
I see that it's just dust in the wind

Dust in the wind, mamaEmbed
