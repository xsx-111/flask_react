Catch the Wind LyricsIn the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty
I want to be in the warm hold of your loving mind
To feel you all around me
And to take your hand along the sand
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing
T'would make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near, to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind
Standing in your heart is where I want to be
And I long to be
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind3Embed
