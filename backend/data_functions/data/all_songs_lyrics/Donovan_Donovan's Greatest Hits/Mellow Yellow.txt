Mellow Yellow Lyrics
I'm just mad about Saffron
Saffron's mad about me
I'm-a just mad about Saffron
She's just mad about me

They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow

I'm just mad about fourteen
Fourteen's mad about me
I'm just mad about fourteen
She's just mad about me

They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
Born-a high forever to fly
A-Wind a-velocity nil
Born-a high forever to fly
If you want your cup I will fill

They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
(So mellow, he's so yellow)


Electrical banana
Is gonna be a sudden craze
Electrical banana
Is bound to be the very next phase

They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
Saffron -- yeah
I'm just mad about her
I'm-a just-a mad-a about-a Saffron
She's just mad about me

They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
(Quite rightly)
They call me mellow yellow
(Oh so yellow, oh so mellow)1Embed
