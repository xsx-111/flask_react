Every Tear Disappears Lyrics
Oh, a smile is more than showing teeth
Oh, it's not the potion, it's the magic that I seek

Every tear disappears
Every tear disappears

Oh, the more that I struggle, oh, the deeper in the pit
If I can show a hand then I can show a fist

Call the twenty-first century, tell her "Give us a break"

Every tear disappears
Every tear disappears

Oh, and what about the pain?
Don't ask me how, I just know that it fades
Hey hey hey

Every tear disappears
Every eye is a seer
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice
Yeah, I live on wire
Yeah, I've been born twice3Embed
