Digital Witness (DARKSIDE Remix) Lyrics
People turn the TV on, it looks like a window
Yeah
People turn the TV on, it looks like a window
Yeah

Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, if you can't see me
What's the point of doing anything?

I want all of your mind
Turn the TV on, it looks just like a window
Yeah
People turn the TV on, it looks just like a window
Yeah

Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, if you can't see me
Watch me jump right off the London Bridge

People turn the TV on, it looks like a window
Yeah
People turn the TV on, it looks like a window
Yeah
Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, if you can't see me
Watch me jump right off the London Bridge

People turn the TV on and throw it out the window, yeah
People turn the TV on and throw it out the window, yeah
(Back) To your stare, I care but I don't care
Oh, oh, oh, I want all of your mind
Gimme all of your mind
I want all of your mindEmbed
