Digital Witness Lyrics
Get back to your seats
Get back, gnashing teeth
I want all of your mind
People turn the TV on, it looks just like a window
Yeah
People turn the TV on, it looks just like a window
Yeah

Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, if you can't see me
What's the point of doing anything?

This is no time for confessing

I want all of your mind
People turn the TV on, it looks just like a window
Yeah
People turn the TV on, it looks just like a window
Yeah

Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show, if you can't see me
Watch me jump right off the London Bridge
This is no time for confessing

People turn the TV on and throw it out the window, yeah
Get back to your stare, I care but I don't care
Oh oh oh I want all of your mind
Gimme all of your mind
I want all of your mind
Gimme all of it

Digital witnesses
What's the point of even sleeping?
If I can't show it, if you can't see me
What's the point of doing anything?
What's the point of even sleeping?
So I stopped sleeping yeah I stopped sleeping
Won't somebody sell me back to me?37Embed
