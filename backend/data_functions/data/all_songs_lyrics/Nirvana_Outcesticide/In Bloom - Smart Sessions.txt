In Bloom - Smart Sessions Lyrics(Verse 1)
Sell the kids for food
Weather changes moods
Spring is here again
Reproductive glands
(Chorus)
He's the one who likes
All our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say
He's the one who likes
All our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say yeah
(Verse 2)
We can have some more
Nature is a whore
Bruises on the fruit
Tender age in bloom
(Chorus)
He's the one who likes
All our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say
He's the one who likes
All our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say yeah
(Chorus)
He's the one who likes
All our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means and I say
He's the one who likes
All our pretty songs
And he likes to sing along
And he likes to shoot his gun
But he knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
Knows not what it means
And I say yeahEmbed
