Lithium - Smart Sessions Lyrics(Lithium mix 6)

I'm so happy - 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly - that's okay 'cause so are you
We broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' - is every day for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles - in a daze 'cause I've found God

Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey

I'm so lonely - that's okay, I shaved your head
And I'm not sad
And just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure
I'm so excited - I can't wait to meet you there
But I don't care
I'm so horny - that's okay, my will is good
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah

I like it - I'm not gonna crack
I need you - I'm not gonna crack
I love you - I'm not gonna crack
I killed you - I'm not gonna crack
I like it - I'm not gonna crack
I miss you -  I'm not gonna crack
I love you - I'm not gonna crack
I killed you - I'm not gonna crack

I'm so happy 'cause today I found my friends
They're in my head
I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
We broke our mirrors
Sunday mornin' is every day for all I care
And I'm not scared
Light my candles in a daze 'cause I've found God
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah hey
Yeah

I like it - I'm not gonna crack
I miss you - I'm not gonna crack
I love you - I'm not gonna crack
I killed you - I'm not gonna crack
I like it - I'm not gonna crack
I miss you - I'm not gonna crack
I love you - I'm not gonna crack
I killed you - I'm not gonna crack
I like it - I'm not gonna crack
I miss you - I'm not gonna crack
I love you - I'm not gonna crack
I killed you - I'm not gonna crack
I like it...Embed
