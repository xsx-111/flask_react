Fuck this Band LyricsFuck this band
And their demon seed
Cos if they burst out
You're responsible
Yeah fuck this band
Cos their clothes don't fit
But their dancing clowns
Are incredible
Keep your passport near
There is no other disappointment here
There is no other disappointment here
There are no other obstacles
Fuck this band
Cos they swear too much
It's an obvious ploy
And irresponsible
Fuck this band
Yeah fuck their holes
But if they split up
You're responsible
Keep your passport near
There is no other disappointment here
There is no other disappointment here
There are no other obstacles
Fuck this band
And their foolish pride
Which lets them think
They can get away with thisEmbed
