Clique Application Form LyricsNever been kissed never been kissed
And no law can govern her
Never been kissed never been kissed
And no law can govern her
Eighteen years of handstands
Nineteen sixty-eight
Never been kissed never been kissed
And no law can govern her
At twenty five past six
They finally found a use for her
Never been kissed never been kissed
And the whole crew to welcome her
Never been kissed never been kissed
And no law can govern her
Never been kissed never been kissed
Never been kissed never been kissed
Never been kissed never been kissed
And no law can govern herEmbed
