Collagen Rock LyricsThe little kid pissed on the big kids porch
He thinks he's amazing he's rubbish of course
But one of those bands got paid I heard
One of those bands got paid
It's easy to say now their trainers seemed fine
And their hair was a fucking delight
But one of those bands got paid I heard
One of those bands got fake tits, yeah
C-c-c-collagen rock!
And one of those bands got legs like you
And one of them got the stare
And one of those bands got found I heard
In a hole in Aberdare
Its easy to say now their trainers seemed fine
And their hair was a fucking delight
But one of those bands got paid I heard
One of those bands got fake tits, yeah
C-c-c-collagen rock!
You've got a mouth got a wonderful mouth
You've got a mouth got a wonderful mouth you got a
You've got a mouth got a wonderful mouth
You've got a mouth got a wonderful mouth you got a
You've got a mouth got a wonderful mouth
You've got a mouth got a wonderful mouth you got a
You've got a mouth got a wonderful mouth
You've got a mouth got a wonderful mouth you got a
One-two!
C-c-c-collagen rock!
C-c-c-collagen rock!
C-c-c-collagen rock!Embed
