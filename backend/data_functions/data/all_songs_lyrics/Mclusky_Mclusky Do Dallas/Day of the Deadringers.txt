Day of the Deadringers LyricsThis one's for the patriots
The new wave good time girls
And if it wasn't for the Decepticons
They'd rule the fucking world
In the midst of all the killing and skin eating
We forgot about the loving
If I had to choose a woman then I think I'd choose religion
If I had to give you something then I think I'd give you nothing
If I had to give you something then I think I'd go to hell
Yeah!
This ones for the dancers
The dockers and the dykes
And if it weren't for Asian basin sales
They couldn't sleep at night
In the midst of all the touching and the kissing
We forget the penetration
If I had to drive you somewhere then I'd drive you to the station
If I had to give you something then I think I'd give you nothing
If I had to give you something then I think I'd go to hell
Yeah!
In the midst of all the killing and skin eating
We forgot about the loving
If I had to choose a woman then I think I'd choose religion
If I had to give you something then I think I'd give you nothing
If I had to give you something then I think I'd
In the middle of the action they reversed the interaction
And the audience decided ignorance actually was bliss
You're a fortress in a foreign land
You should ask for it
Like you mean it, like you mean it!
In the middle of the oh-my-god-it's-gone
We talked in code to get along
Private riddles, for private courts
In the middle of the oh-my-god-it's-gone
We talked in code to get along
Private riddles, for private courts
Yeah!Embed
