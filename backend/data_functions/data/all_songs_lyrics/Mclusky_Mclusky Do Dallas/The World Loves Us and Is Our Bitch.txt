The World Loves Us and Is Our Bitch LyricsYou need some coke-coke-coke-coke inspiration
For your se-se-se-se-seven year itch
She said its just that your song's been playing too long
The world loves us and is our bitch
Hiding in the water
Under the sea
Under the water
We've got all the money
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello
You need some c-c-c-c-condescension
For your ba-ba-ba-ba-elegant witch
She said its just that your song's been playing too long
The world loves us and is our bitch
Hiding in the water
Under the sea
Under the water
We've got all the money
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello
Still accidents happen where the rain won't go
God is a colour that we can't let go
And faith is admission that we just can't win
And we are just a part of this
And we are just a part of this
Relatives matter when your legs don't work
K-Y K-Y STD
Alcohol matters when you can't be free
And love is eternal 'til it isn't anymore
Love is eternal 'til it isn't anymore
Love is eternal 'til it isn't anymore
Love is eternal 'til it isn't anymore
I try to cry but I'm just too tall
I try to cry but I'm just too tall
Cos accidents happen where the rain won't go
Accidents happen where the rain won't goEmbed
