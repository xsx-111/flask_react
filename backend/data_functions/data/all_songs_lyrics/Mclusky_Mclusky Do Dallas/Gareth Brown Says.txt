Gareth Brown Says LyricsAll of your friends are cunts
Your mother is a ballpoint pen thief
Notoriety follows you
Like beatings follow rain
Bring on the big hitters
You've got a prophet's name
You've got a prophet's name
You've got a prophet's name
Still, all of your tales are lies
You've never been to Alton Towers
Michael Caine doesn't follow you
And you've never been to Spain
Bring on the go-getters
You've got a prophet's name
You've got a prophet's name
You've got a prophet's name
You've got a prophet's name
You've got a prophet's name
You've got a prophet's name
You've got a prophet's name
