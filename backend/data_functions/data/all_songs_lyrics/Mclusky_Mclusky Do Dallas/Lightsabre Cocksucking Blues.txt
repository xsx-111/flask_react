Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues Lyrics
Eat what you are while you're falling apart
And it opened a can of worms
The gun's in my hand and I know it looks bad
But believe me I'm innocent
I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying
And flying is fearful of me
I covered my eyes when she told me the news
Turning me on with my lightsabre cocksucking blues

Are you coming?
Are you coming?
Are you coming?
Are you coming?

Nicotine stained on account of her crutch
And I'm aching from fucking too much
I know what I do but it all points to you
Did you sell me to wanderlust?
I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying
And flying is fearful of me
I covered my eyes when she told me the news
Turning me on with my lightsabre cocksucking blues
Are you coming?
Are you coming?
Are you coming?
Are you coming?

Eat what you are while you're falling apart
And it opened a can of worms
The gun's in my hand and I know it looks bad
But believe me I'm innocent
I'm fearful I'm fearful I'm fearful of flying
And flying is fearful of me
I covered my eyes when she told me the news
Turning me on with my lightsabre cocksucking blues1Embed
