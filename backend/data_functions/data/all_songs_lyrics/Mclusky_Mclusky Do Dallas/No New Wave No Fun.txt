No New Wave No Fun LyricsIf there's no new wave, then there's no fun
Here we go, here we go, mungo got a radio
If it's out of reach, then it can't be wrong
Here we go, here we go, mungo got a radio
Try and find a better way there is no other better way
Try and find a better way there is no other better way
Try and find a better way there is no other better way
Try and find a better way there is no other better way
There is no other better way
If it turns you on, you should wash your hands
Here we go, here we go, mungo got a radio
If there's no new wave, then there's no fun
Here we go, here we go, mungo got a radio
Try and find a better way there is no other better way
Try and find a better way there is no other better way
Try and find a better way there is no other better way
Try and find a better way there is no other better way
There is no other better way
There is no other better way
There is no other better way
There is no other better way
No new wave no fun
No new wave no fun
No new wave no fun
No new wave no fun1Embed
