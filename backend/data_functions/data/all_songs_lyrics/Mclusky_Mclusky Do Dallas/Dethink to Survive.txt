Dethink to Survive LyricsSecret fuhrers got your tongue
And bitches got your car
And if it wasn't for the '86 world cup
It wouldn't have got this far
But she was un in de in re contrary
Pissed but almost right
And if it wasn't for the snakes in cumberbunds
It would happen every night
Dethink to survive
Dethink to survive
Dethink to survive
Dethink to survive
Cartoon monkeys got you hard
It must have been the hair
Though Jive Bunny stole your creative fire
You really didn't care
But she was un in re in de decided
Happy killing time
But there's an eight per cent chance that you know Charles dance
And you're no damn friend of mine
Dethink to survive
Dethink to survive
Dethink to survive
Dethink to survive
