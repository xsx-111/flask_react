Whoyouknow LyricsI'm tired of explaining that it wasn't supposed to be allowed
I'd buy it but it wasn't supposed to be like this
You can't touch me, I'm never over
But your heart's gone the colour of coca-cola
I'm laughing cos I'm saving for an overdraft
Because I only want a video or photograph
Of that time you knocked my sister over
But your heart's gone the colour of a dustbin
I'm tired of explaining that it wasn't supposed to be allowed
I'd buy it but it wasn't supposed to be like this
You can't touch me, I'm never over
But your heart's gone the colour of coca-cola
Your heart's gone the colour of a dustbin
Your heart's gone the colour of coca-cola
Rescind yourself as you get older
Younger faces come to steal your fire
But your heart's gone the colour of coca-cola
Rescind yourself as you get older
Younger faces come to steal your fire
But you already know me
You already know me
Well you already know me
You already knowEmbed
