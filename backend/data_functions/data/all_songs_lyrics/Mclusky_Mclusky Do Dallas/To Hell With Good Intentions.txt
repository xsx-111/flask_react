To Hell With Good Intentions LyricsMy love is bigger than your love
We take more drugs than a touring funk band
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My band is better than your band
We've got more songs than a song convention
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
And we're all going straight to hell
My dad is bigger than your dad
He's got eight cars and a house in Ireland
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
When we gonna torch the restaurant?
Sing it
When we gonna pay the guide dog?
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
And we're all going straight to hell
My love is bigger than your love
We take more drugs than a touring funk band
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
When we gonna torch the restaurant?
Sing it
When we gonna get excited?
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
My love is bigger than your love
Sing it
And we're all going straight to hell
And we're all going straight to hellEmbed
