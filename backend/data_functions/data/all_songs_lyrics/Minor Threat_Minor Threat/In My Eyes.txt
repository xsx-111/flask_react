In My Eyes Lyrics
You tell me you like the taste
You just need an excuse
You tell me it calms your nerves
You just think it looks cool
You tell me you want to be different
You just change for the same
You tell me it's only natural
You just need the proof
Did you fucking get it?

It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes
It doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes

You tell me that nothing matters
You're just fucking scared
You tell me that I'm better
You just hate yourself
You tell me that you like her
You just wish you did
You tell me that I make no difference
At least I'm fuckin' trying
What the fuck have you done?
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
And it doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes
It doesn't look that way to me
In my eyes

Thanks a lot, friends5Embed
