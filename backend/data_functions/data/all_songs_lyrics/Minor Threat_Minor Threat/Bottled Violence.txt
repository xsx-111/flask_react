Bottled Violence Lyrics
Get your bravery from a six pack
Get your bravery from a half-pint
Drink your whiskey, drink your grain
Bottoms up, and you don't feel pain
Drink your whiskey, drink your grain
Bottoms up, and you don't feel pain

Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight!
Bottled violence!

Lose control of your body
Beat the shit out of somebody
Half-shut eyes don't see who you hit
You don't take any shit!
Half-shut eyes don't see who you hit
You don't take any shit!

Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight!
Bottled violence!
Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight, fight!
Go out and fight!
Bottled violence!Embed
