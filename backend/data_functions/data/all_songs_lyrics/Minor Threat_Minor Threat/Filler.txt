Filler Lyrics
What happened to you?
You're not the same
There's something in your head
Made a violent change

It's in your head, it's in your head, it's in your head
Don't look!
You call it religion, you're full of shit
Filler

Was she really worth it?
She cost you your life
You'll never leave her side
She's gonna be your wife

It's in your head, it's in your head, it's in your head
Don't look!
You call it romance, you're full of shit
Filler

Your brain is clay
What's going on?
You picked up a Bible
And now you're gone
It's in your head, it's in your head, it's in your head
Don't look!
You call it religion, you're full of shit
Filler

You never knew, you never will
Don't look!
You're just a sheep, looking for a shepherd
Filler
What is going on?
Filler, filler, filler, filler in your head5Embed
