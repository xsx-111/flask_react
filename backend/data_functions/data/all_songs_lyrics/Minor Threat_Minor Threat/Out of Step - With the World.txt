Out of Step - With the World Lyrics
I don't smoke
I don't drink
I don't fuck
At least I can fucking think

I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
Out of step with the world!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
Out of step with the world!

I don't smoke
I don't drink
I don't fuck
At least I can fucking think

I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
Out of step with the world!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
Out of step with the world!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
Out of step with the world!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
I can't keep up!
Out of step with the world!Embed
