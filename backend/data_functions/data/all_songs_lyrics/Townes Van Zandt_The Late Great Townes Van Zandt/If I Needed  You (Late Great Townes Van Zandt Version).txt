If I Needed  You (Late Great Townes Van Zandt Version) Lyrics
Well if I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me and ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your pain

In the night forlorn, ah the morning's born
And the morning shines with the lights of love
And you will miss sunrise, if you close your eyes
That would break my heart in two

The lady's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lily hand in mine
Loop and Lil agree she's a sight to see
A treasure for the poor to find

Well if I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me and ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I would swim the seas for to ease your painEmbed
