German Mustard (A Clapalong) Lyrics
Ah, my baby come walking, walkin' nice and slow
Like a Mo
My baby come, come nice and slow
Wear a good man out
Like a son of a bitch
Then they turn around and they smile at you, babe
Just like they didn't know you

They pump that bad blood in ya
Just like a fireman shootin' dogs
Fireman don't carry no guns, everybody knows that
They pump that bad
Just like a fireman shooting dogs
Keep low when the shooting starts
Um, um, huh
Guitar, comin' up

My baby, say you lonesome
I say you don't know what it means, nah nah
Just me and some of my friends
My baby, say you lonesome
I have a little drink and I say
Baby, you don't know what it means
That German mustard 'tween your jeansEmbed
