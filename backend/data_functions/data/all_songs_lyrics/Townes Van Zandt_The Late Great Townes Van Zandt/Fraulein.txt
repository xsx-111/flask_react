Fraulein Lyrics
Far across the deep blue water lives an old German's daughter
On the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her, now I can't forget her
For she was my pretty Fraulein

Well Fraulein, Fraulein, walk down by the river
Tonight when those stars start to shine
By those same stars above you, well I swear that I love you
For you are my pretty Fraulein

Oh, when my memory wanders away over yonder
To the one that I left behind
In a moment of glory, her face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

Well Fraulein, Fraulein, walk down by the river
Tonight when the stars start to shine, shine
By those same stars above you, well I swear that I love you
Oh, you are my pretty FrauleinEmbed
