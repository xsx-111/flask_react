No Lonesome Tune Lyrics
I ain't gonna sing no lonesome tune
Ah, babe, I'm a-coming soon
I cannot believe I stayed so long away
But a man must look around
And you're the sweetest thing I've found
Ah your lost high roller's rolling home today

Well, my Daddy said to me
"Son, it's hard, as you will see
To find someone upon whom to rely"
And in the kitchen, Mama sneezed
And he grinned big as you please
Said, "Bless you" and a tear come to his eye

I did decide that very day
That I would like to live that way
And now I know I just been wasting time
It's with you that I should be
And if you feel the same 'bout me
Well I'm headed home along the straightest line

Ain't gonna sing no lonesome tune
Ah, babe, I'm a-coming soon
I cannot believe I stayed so long away
But a man must look around
And you're the sweetest thing I've found
Ah your lost high roller's rolling home todayEmbed
