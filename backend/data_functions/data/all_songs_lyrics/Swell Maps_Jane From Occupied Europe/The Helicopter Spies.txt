The Helicopter Spies LyricsThere aren't that many trees in Arabia
Think how many you've seen
I'd rather buy a moat than another lawn
Back with the guns again
Helicopter spies always break new ground
Deep hidden in sacks of grain
They never have time to dig up the beds
Back with the guns again
Helicopter spies, they make me cry
Helicopter spies, they make me cry
You're always cutting through the undergrowth
There's a passage inside the trees
If you find your way through the tailor's shop
You'll probably be asleep
I'd rather take a day off and find you alive
Than to push through the coral alone
You think you'll find the lagoon again
But they often sink away
Helicopter spies, they make me cry
Helicopter spies, they make me cry
Helicopter spies, they make me cry
Helicopter spies, they make me cry
Helicopter spies always rush around
Their jackets often fall off
They never have time to put them back on again
They're always tough enough
Helicopter spies, they make me cry
Helicopter spies, they make me cry
Helicopter spies, they make me cryEmbed
