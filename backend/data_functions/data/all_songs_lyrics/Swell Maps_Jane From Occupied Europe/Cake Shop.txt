Cake Shop LyricsCake shop girls grow fingernails
Dead long and rather sharp
They paint them glace cherry red
And yellow marzipan
Scoring lines upon the backs Of tender chocolate mice
I would like to buy a wedding cake for you and me!
You've always been a cake shop girl as far as I recall
Ballroom dancer minatures alongside cherokees
Cake shop girl, oh cake shop girl I'd fall on bended knees
I should like to buy a wedding cake for you and me
Confectioners don't eat a thing
That's made inside their shops
Bottles of crushed beetle
Can be bought to turn things red
Window front displays are made
For only perfect things
I should like to substitute a cake for you and me
