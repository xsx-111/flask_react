New York LyricsI don't wanna go because I know
And all of those toys that crawl, they just reach for doors
I don't wanna go because I know
And I've seen you, you're crying above the ship
You just stuck out hiding from the trees
You just lost your fame inside the shop
I don't wanna go because I know
Oh! I can't see the pictures that you lost
I don't wanna go because I know
The only way out is to wait for it again
You just stuck out hiding from the trees
You just lost your fame inside the shop
I don't wanna go because I know
And I just bought a ship it's made of brass
I don't wanna go because I know
You're falling from the target like a toy
You just stuck out hiding from the trees
You just lost your fame inside the shop
I don't wanna go because I know
And I don't wanna ever see your face again, no more
Oh! I don't wanna go because I know
You pick it up and keep it like a toy
You just stuck out hiding from the trees
You just lost your fame inside the shopEmbed
