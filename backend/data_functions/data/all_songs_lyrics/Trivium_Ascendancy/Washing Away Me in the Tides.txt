Washing Away Me in the Tides Lyrics
Disgusted with what I see
So many pieces left of you and me
Glass falls like rain
I'll crucify you for this pain... for this pain

Tonight, I leave this town
In love, I'd burn it all down
(To the ground) You're nothing to me
(To the ground) You're fucking killing me

Abandon all hope
Washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made 'round my neck
Accepting the end

Longing to see your face
So my hand can form into a mace
Everything smells of you
Even the gasoline that covers you

Tonight, I leave this town
In love, I'd burn it all down
(To the ground) You're nothing to me
(To the ground) You're fucking killing me
Abandon all hope
Washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made 'round my neck
Accepting the end



Everything smells of you
Even the gasoline that covers you

Tonight, I leave this town
In love, I'd burn it all down
(To the ground) You're nothing to me
(To the ground) You're fucking killing me

Abandon all hope
Washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made 'round my neck
Accepting the end
Abandon all hope
Washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made 'round my neck
Accepting the endEmbed
