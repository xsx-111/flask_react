Departure Lyrics
This weight is so unbearable, caving my lungs
All my life seems to be flashing in front of my eyes
Run away from all the pain, all the pain of life

Run away from all the pain of life

Ways of devotion turn to obsession
Open your eyes
I want you to see what you've done to me
Crying out those eyes
Run away from all the pain, all the pain of life

Run away from all the pain of life
Bring my end to an end

Distance yourself from the pain
That covers me
I reach out for your hand to find
There's nothing left for me

Razors kiss the vein
Overdose for pain
A 12-gauge cross kisses the forehead
A savior in a shell
Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, fuck the world, fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson, I begin to drown
Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, fuck the world, fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson, I begin to drown


Run away from all the pain of life
Bring my end to an end

Distance yourself from the pain
That covers me
I reach out for your hand to find
There's nothing left for me
Distance yourself from the pain
That covers me
I reach out for your hand to find
There's nothing left for meEmbed
