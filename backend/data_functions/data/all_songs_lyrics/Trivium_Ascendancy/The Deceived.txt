The Deceived Lyrics
Disintegration constituents
To decompose of the parts (of the parts, of the parts)
A malformation: utopia
Systematic unity can't be achieved

Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame
(That force you, that force you)
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame

We are the deceived (Deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (Lost in the foreseen)
We are the deceived (Deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (Lost in the foreseen)

To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed

Disintegration constituents
To decompose of the parts (of the parts, of the parts)
A malformation: utopia
Systematic unity can't be achieved
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame
(That force you, that force you)
Be numb to all the things
That force you to frame

We are the deceived (Deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (Lost in the foreseen)
We are the deceived (Deceived)
Lost in the foreseen (Lost in the foreseen)

To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed

Behold your fellow man
Through centuries of control
Adhering to the decrees
Of a manufactured god

Behold your fellow man
Through centuries of control
Adhering to the decrees
Of a manufactured god


To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failed
To wait for aforementioned dreams
Time will only tell
Tell that the promised have been failedEmbed
