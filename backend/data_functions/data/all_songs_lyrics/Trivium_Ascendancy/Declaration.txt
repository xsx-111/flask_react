Declaration Lyrics
"Freedom" is all I have to say in defense
Of what the world's becoming
A nation hell-bent on choosing what's right
And how we should all live our lives

Fuck their ways; it is time to break free
Fuck their hate; acceptance is what we need

Equality for every race, sex, sexuality
And every choice to live our lives
And to you, bigot, cretin, ignoramus
Mind your own goddamn fucking business

Fuck their ways; it is time to break free
Fuck their hate; acceptance is what we need

Holding onto what makes, makes us whole
Never letting their poison take control

Freezing the air (That stands between all of us)
Closing the eyes (Bear witness to me)
Feeling the fear (That stands between all of us)
Closing the eyes (Bear witness to me)

I'll be right here
Falling away
Fighting on principle
I'll die one thousand times
Before I'll ever be them
Fighting on principle
I'll die one thousand times
Before I'll ever be them

Burn the scriptures
Bury the governing
Free yourself
Break the structures
Declare freedom
Burn the scriptures
Bury the governing
Free yourself
Break the structures
Declare freedom
Burn the scriptures
Bury the governing
Free yourself
Break the structures
Declare freedom
Burn the scriptures
Bury the governing
Free yourself
Break the structures
Declare freedom
Burn!

"Freedom" is all I have to say in defense
Of what the world's becoming
A nation hell-bent on choosing what's right
And how we should all live our lives

Fuck their ways; it is time to break free
Fuck their hate; acceptance is what we need

Holding onto what makes us whole
Never letting their poison take control

Freezing the air (That stands between all of us)
Closing the eyes (Bear witness to me)
Feeling the fear (That stands between all of us)
Closing the eyes (Bear witness to me)
Freezing the air (That stands between all of us)
Closing the eyes (Bear witness to me)
Feeling the fear (That stands between all of us)
Closing the eyes (Bear witness to me)

Burn!Embed
