Blinding Tears Will Break the Skies Lyrics
One by one, they fall to ensure liberty
Freedom fighters, raise your fists to ensure victory

This life is a battle
We must fight to ensure (To ensure)
They can't take what's in our hearts
It's all that we truly own

They'll try to take (Try to take)
What's really ours (Really ours)
They'll never take (Never take)
What's in our hearts

This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies

One by one, they fall to ensure liberty
Freedom fighters, raise your fists to ensure victory
This life is a battle
We must fight to ensure (To ensure)
They can't take what's in our hearts
It's all that we truly own

They'll try to take (Try to take)
What's really ours (Really ours)
They'll never take (Never take)
What's in our hearts

This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies

This war is on everything that you find comfort in
All I want is for your kind to burn
This war is on everything that you find comfort in
All I want is for your kind to burn

They'll try to take (Try to take)
What's really ours (Really ours)
They'll never take (Never take)
What's in our hearts

This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skies
This silence moves everything once held beating
Into alignment with the skiesEmbed
