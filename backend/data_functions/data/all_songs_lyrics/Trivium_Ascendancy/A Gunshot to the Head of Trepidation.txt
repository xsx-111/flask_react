A Gunshot to the Head of Trepidation Lyrics
You starve your children on neglect
Then feed their bellies with fear (Bellies with fear)
Concussion, bat to the brain
Witness to a battered mother (Battered mother)

Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear
(No longer will your family fear)
A gunshot to head of trepidation
(Trepidation)
My promise if you ever lay a finger

Just look at the scars you make
Your terror makes your kids break (Makes your kids break)
A broken home, just as you were raised
With fists raised up to your children

Your abuse will end right here
No longer will your family fear
(No longer will your family fear)
A gunshot to head of trepidation
(Trepidation)
My promise if you ever lay a finger
This battle is on all
You've made beautiful
Now hateful
You wretched life wrecker
Abuser
Now suffer

Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife, we'll strike down the hand
(Open fire, build the pyre)
If I can't make you see the damage you've made
(Open fire, build the pyre)
I'll make you wish you'd never been alive



Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife, we'll strike down the hand
Open fire
On the desire of the man
Open fire
With strife, we'll strike down the hand
(Open fire, build the pyre)
If I can't make you see the damage you've made
(Open fire, build the pyre)
I'll make you wish you'd never been aliveEmbed
