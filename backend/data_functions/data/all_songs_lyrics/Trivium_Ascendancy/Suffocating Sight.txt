Suffocating Sight Lyrics
I am but a farce, a satire of stability
Insecurity is an uphill struggle
It's me versus the world
The shore still starves for another

Novel of my shipwrecked being
Tied up, dried, alive, still breathing
The sands of time, for me, are running out

My hands shake in apprehension
Of every action, I'm guilty of playing the victim
The shore still starves for another

Novel of my shipwrecked being
Tied up, dried, alive, still breathing
The sands of time, for me, are running out

Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you

It's time for your panic
Then it kills and makes you manic
Making its way inside—relax; it's all right
Making its way inside—relax; it's all right
Panic grips your frantic breathing
I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe!


Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy you

Just like the embrace of arms that made you
They'll surely destroy youEmbed
