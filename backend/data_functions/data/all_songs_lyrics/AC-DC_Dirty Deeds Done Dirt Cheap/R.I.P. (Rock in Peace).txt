R.I.P. (Rock in Peace) Lyrics
Ahhhhhhhh, Leave me alone
Like a dog with a bone
Like a stone that's been thrown
Let me be on my own

Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace

Out of my way
Got a boogie to play
Every dog has his day
Rock 'n' roll's here to stay

Let me rock
Let me roll
Let me rock
Let me rock in peace
Ooh, feels good
Mama, mama
Just like I knew it would
I get my kicks
Outta playing my licks
Outta laying my chicks
Down on Route 66



(Rock, rock, rock in peace)
I wanna rock (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
Just let me rock (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
I wanna (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
Oh, let me rock
Let me rock in peace
Yeah, that feels good
Hey, mama
Just like I knew it would


(Rock, rock, rock in peace)
I wanna (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
Oh, wanna rock (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
Ooh, rock (Rock, rock, rock in peace)
I wanna rock
Let me rock in peace
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) Like Little Richard
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) Oh, and Jerry Lee
(Rock, rock, rock in peace) Like Chuck, baby
(Rock, rock, rock in peace)
I wanna rock
Let me rock in peace2Embed
