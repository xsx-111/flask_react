Lay My Love LyricsI am the crow of desperation
I need no fact or validation
I span relentless variation
I scramble in the dust of a failing nation
I was concealed
Now I am stirring
And I have waited for this time
I am the termite of temptation
I multiply and find my population
I am the wheel
I am the turning
And I will lay my love around you
I am the sea of permutation
I live beyond interpretation
I scramble all the names and the combinations
I penetrate the walls of explanation
I am the will
I am the burning
And I will lay my love around you
I am the will
I am the yearning
And I will lay my love around youEmbed
