Crime in the Desert LyricsCrime and punishment down in Tucson
Back to normal in the sun
Playing blackjack in the drive-in
Shooting snake-eyes in the mud
And when the moonlight came out, we were gone, long gone
They found a body on the race-track
No identifying signs
In his pocket was a notebook
With a number inside
And Guadalajara's just a few miles down the line
She adored the brokenhearted
And those who showed her a bad time
They didnâ€™t care for her body
They took advantage of her mind
So they took her ideas and they left her behindEmbed
