One Word LyricsNight-time is falling on the Louvre
It's been a lazy afternoon
We walk to the house, the air is clear
The water's still moving in the pool
You say (One word)
The same (One sound)
Thing (It makes)
Again (the world go 'round)
One word (You'll see)
We fight (You can't win)
We're in (The same place)
A game (but not the same spin)
Let it all fade away (If it fades away)
I don't mind
We were miles away, we were miles away
We were miles and miles away
Remember this oil by Augustus John?
These are the ones I found in Rome
There are few things I keep for long
When does your plane leave for Cologne?
I recall (One word)
The train (I saw)
People danced (That's all it took)
Again (to turn them around)
One world (Strange world)
We're in (No sound)
We'll find (The same things)
The same thing (are everywhere around)
Never mind, you'll see
With time, we'll dance again
If it all fades away...let it all fade dancing away
All the sounds I heard (One word)
On a summer night (I found)
And the quiet words (That's all it took)
We exchanged (to turn him around)
I felt she was pulling back (She watched)
To emphasize (He sighs)
I was falling (He waits for)
Into Mona Lisa's eyes (a touch of her eyes)
And she turned (and then)
And she turned (she turns away)
She was far away (She won't let him touch her any more today)
She was miles away, she was miles away
She was so many miles awayEmbed
