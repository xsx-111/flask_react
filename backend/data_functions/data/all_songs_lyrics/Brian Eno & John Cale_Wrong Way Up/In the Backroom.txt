In the Backroom Lyrics
When señoritas walk at night
Cabañeros on the move
It's music to their ears in the backroom
If there's money to be made
And it's 100' in the shade
Here in the backroom
She's sentimental, like the last
As the foreigner's running past her to the backroom
And if things aren't sweet in Mecca
She'll be begging for forgiveness in the vacuum

They're taking pains with California
And they're guaranteeing boredom for the monsoon
And apart from what was offered
There were mothers buying orphans at the auction
You're much better off in twos
If you're coming to see the carnage in the backroom
Doubled over on the table
I was concentrating harder in the backroom
Weaving in and out of consciousness
Hiding out behind the entrance to the backroom
It took longer than expected:
They had difficulty swallowing capsules
We had a keener nose for trouble
Than the sniffer-dogs at Heathrow
You'd be trousers down in no time
In the backroom
Almost nothing in the papers
Told me it happened when they emptied out the backroomEmbed
