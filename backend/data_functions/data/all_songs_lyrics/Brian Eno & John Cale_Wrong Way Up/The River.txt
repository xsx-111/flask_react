The River LyricsSo deep in the water
Sleep, dark as the night
Somehow it seems it was all another dream
Soon dissolved in the light
Oh, we were by the waterline
Vague, the song of the night
Innocent to all the peasant gods with you
So, we drink to be renewed
On the long, deep river
Where the moorhens cry
As the first sun quivers in the open sky...
Oh, she came down the river
Soon, all the leaves were still
The current was strong and the river was so long
So, we drink to be renewed
In the long cool evening
Where the peacocks shiver
And the boat starts down the silver river way...
I remember you saying
As her deep eyes opened
In the first light seeing her, "Here is someone new"1Embed
