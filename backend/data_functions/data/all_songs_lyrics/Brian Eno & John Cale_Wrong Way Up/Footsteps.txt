Footsteps LyricsI'm a man of many colours:
Only yesterday I was blue
Ten days from now, I'll be different
And so will you
Written there in capital letters
So as not to be misunderstood
Making sure I'm clear
Telling bad from good
Two weeks ago in tokyo
A man from islamabad:
Selling shells back to the rebels
Shells they never had
All is clear: I can see for miles and miles
I can hear your footsteps in my heart
Somebody make me an offer
I've got to get away from here, ooh, ooh, ooh
Driving hard through the snow-drift
Like a moth to a naked light
To keep an appointment in zurich
With a man who hears footsteps in the night
Tired of what he's been doing
What it's done to his life...
Getting most if what he needed
Has left him with less than he had
All is clear: I can see for miles and miles
All I hear are your footsteps in my heartEmbed
