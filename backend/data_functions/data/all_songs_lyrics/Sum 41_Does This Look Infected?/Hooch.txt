Hooch Lyrics
It's your last chance to find yourself in consequence
It's so hard to find a simple reason
Maybe I'll find myself with evidence
Hate breeds with nothing to believe in
Another day another day in paradise
If you only knew wouldn't it be nice

Get away, get away, get away
I'm about to detonate

Everything to prove
Nothing to lose
Just when everything has fallen to the ground
Going to knock it down
Just believe me when I tell you it's alright

This time we're on our way to tragedy
Forever bored and outside from the in crowd
I've come to grip confronting my reality
Numb struck it's me against the world now
For all you know for all you know it's not for real
Spare me the obsession that you deal
Get away, get away, get away
I'm about to detonate

Everything to prove
Nothing to lose
Just when everything has fallen to the ground
Going to knock it down
Just believe me when I tell you it's alright
Everything to prove
Nothing to lose
Just when everything has fallen to the ground
Going to knock it down
Just believe me when I tell you it's alright

I should've know right from the start
That you'd take this trust and rip me apart
Could be a change of heart


I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real
I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real
I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is real
I'll fall into you, but don't believe that this is realEmbed
