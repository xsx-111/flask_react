All Messed Up LyricsAnother day wasted out of time
I can't get out of this
Altered state of mind
I'm going overboard
My conscience meets decline
Into reality
I know this can't be fine
'Cause I'm all messed up
Making perfect nonsense
Drowning in my doubt to hell
'Cause I'm all messed up
Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind
So blind
Who are these voices in my head?
I can't go on like this
Living like the dead
I haven't slept so long
Feeling sad I dread
I'm talking to myself
Forgot what I just said
'Cause I'm all messed up
Making perfect nonsense
Drowning in my doubt to hell
'Cause I'm all messed up
Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind
So blind
Well I hold my only enemy as closely as a friend
And I sold my own reality to further my descent
Self-destruction taking over it's so easy to pretend
Introduction to this nightmare that now seems may never end
Can anyone help me drag my heels?
I'm running overtime
I can't hold down my meals
My mind is racing by
Staring blankly feels
Like pulling out my teeth
While this engine winds
'Cause I'm all messed up
Making perfect nonsense
Drowning in my doubt to hell
'Cause I'm all messed up
Going nowhere fast but circles in my mind
So blindEmbed
