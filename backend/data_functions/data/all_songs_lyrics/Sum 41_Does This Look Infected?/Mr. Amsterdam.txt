Mr. Amsterdam Lyrics
I've said this before
No matter how hard I try
I can't help be bored
While this world passes by

So this revelation's got no meaning
We lost it all in hopeless grieving
(Am I just losing grip?)
Paint it black and just forget me
(This world's a sinking ship)
'Cause our baggage is too heavy

I can't stop believing there's something to be said
What are we achieving with the bullshit that we're fed?
I know I'm not gonna stay or live to see the day
This world comes to be, here's a resignation from me
A resignation from me
A resignation from me

I've said this before
No matter how hard I try
I can't help be bored
While this world passes by
Don't tell me we're close to something
That we don't even understand
(We're prisoners to our homes)
Some might say we're all to blame
(The outside's so unknown)
I don't want you to complain

I can't find the answers to save humanity
I can't find the anger, here's a resignation from me
A resignation from me
A resignation from me
A resignation from me
A resignation from me2Embed
