Over My Head (Better Off Dead) Lyrics
What happened to you?
You played the victim for so long now in this game
What I thought was true
Is made of fiction and I'm following the same
But if I try to make sense of this mess I'm in
I'm not sure where I should begin
I'm falling
I'm falling

Now I'm in over my head
For something I said
Completely misread, I'm better off dead
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me

It's none of my concern
Don't look to me 'cause I don't believe in fame
I guess you never heard
I met our makers they don't even know your name
But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell
I'd say my time has served me well
I'm falling
I'm falling
And now I'm in over my head
With something I said, completely misread I'm better off dead
And now I can't see how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to

This came long before, those who suffer more
I'm too awake for this to be a nightmare
What's with my disgrace I've lost the human race
No one plans for it to, blow up in their face

Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces?
Who said it was so easy to put back all these pieces?

Now I'm in over my head
For something I said
Completely misread, I'm better off dead
And now I can see, how fake you can be
This hypocrisy's beginning to get to me

Over my head
Better off dead
Over my head
Better off dead
