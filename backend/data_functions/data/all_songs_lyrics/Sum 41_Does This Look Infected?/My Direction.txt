My Direction Lyrics
Perfection is my direction
Even if that's all I had
It's not like I need no correction
I just know that life's not so bad

Picture this, everyday kids that just can't find a way
Stuck in disarray, can't find hope for better day
It's the degeneration of childhood frustration
Over the past 30 years teenaged suicide has increased
300% in North America
And is the second major cause of death in Canada

Perfection is my direction
Even if that's all I had
It's not like I need no correction
I just know that life's not so bad

When will all my problems disappear?
Am I just going crazy from the fear?
Oh my oh my I'm going far past the brink
This pressure is like a weight and I still can't think straight
Prevention is my direction
Even if that's all I had
It's not like I need no correction
I just know that life's not so bad

I've met my destinations
What's left to complain about?
All these aggravations
Building 'til the seams fall out
I'm running my mouth dry
With every time I lie

But don't tell me without a doubt
With dumbfound luck has all run out
But don't tell me without a doubt
With dumbfound luck has all run out
Ran out
Ran out
Ran out

Perfection is my direction
Even if that's all I had
It's not like I need no correction
I just know that life's not so bad1Embed
