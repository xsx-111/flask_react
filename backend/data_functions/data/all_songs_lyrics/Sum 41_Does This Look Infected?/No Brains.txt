No Brains Lyrics
Can't step in my way
Head first in your love and dismay
It's like beating the dead
(Another time or day)
I can't stop going out of my head
Whatever this could be I'd never know
I never said it'd be the end all to be all
I hate you today
I can't find a way
Don't drag me down now

Goodbye
I've had enough frustration
I won't get stuck
Goodbye
This dead end situation
It's just not worth my time

It's no better today
I never thought it would end up this way
You've got something to say?
(You've got something to say?)
Don't want to hear it if it gets in my way
All this confusion, wondering, so overwhelmed
All this illusion seems so clear
Can't find conclusion disappointing evolution
Not all things aren't what they appear
So what's the point of this hell?
I know you too well we're running backwards
Goodbye
I've had enough frustration
I won't get stuck
Goodbye
This dead end situation
It's just not worth my time

But waiting so frustrating, I'm so sick of
All this tension not to mention, I'm so sick of
Can't take it, you won't make it, just save yourself this trouble
(everything's alright)
Get down and pray for yourself cause I'm just fine
(everything's alright)

You speak for all of us when you can't be heard
(I can't help you anymore than)
I'll bet you haven't listened to not one word
(I have helped myself before)
You speak for all of us when you can't be heard
(I can't help you anymore than)
(So sick of, feel so sick of, so sick of, feel so sick of)
I'll bet you haven't listened to not one word
(I have helped myself before)
(So sick of, feel so sick of, so sick of, feel so sick of)
Goodbye
I've had enough frustration
I won't get stuck
Goodbye
This dead end situation
It's just not worth my time

But waiting so frustrating, I'm so sick of
All this tension not to mention, I'm so sick of, sick of you!Embed
