Bonita LyricsWhat can I say to you, Bonita?
What magic words would capture you?
Like a soft evasive mist
You are, Bonita!
You fly away when love is new!
What do you ask of me, Bonita?
What part do you want me to play?
Shall I be the clown for you, Bonita?
I will do anything you say
Bonita, don't run away, Bonita!
Bonita, don't be afraid to fall in love with me
I love you, I tell you, I love you, I love you..... Bonita
If you loved me, life would be beautiful
Boniiiiitaaaaaaa, Boniiiiitaaaaaaa, Boniiiiitaaaaaaa!Embed
