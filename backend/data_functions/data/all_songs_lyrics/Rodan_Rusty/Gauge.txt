Gauge LyricsSet me down to sleep
My body follows without a peep
Eyes grow heavy, closed and numb
Pushing away the dreams come
Of kangaroos which jump so high
Over seas of waves the sound of thunder
Release the whale that pulled me under
But with the whale did come the shark
Which pulls me deeper into the dark
Tossing and turning I start to scream
Mama comes in, says it's just a dream
 night and day
 things they play
She feeds me the stories that set me to sleep
Sedatives, sedatives
When you come home
Will you remember
Everyone, everyone
Who stations your 
 you in
Drugs are gone for a new chemical
Words become fake vehicles
Gone away, gone away
I thought it would never end
Everyone has gone away, gone away, gone away, gone away
Gone away
You're thinking your ace always falls
In the right holes
Never again to be buried behind
In a box of bad dreams
You've got what you wanted and now that you've got it
You, you think that your hands can't be broken
Cast made of silver, silver
Sedatives, sedatives, sedatives, sedatives, sedatives, sedatives...
Building in basements
Evidence of invisible things
That make me feel a little better
Hiding in a safe little room
Nothing is wrong, nothing is wrong, nothing is wrong
Gauge
Pull the shutters closed
Doors locked

I thought it would never endEmbed
