Shiner LyricsAfter last night, after last night it's hard to shine
After last night, after last night it's hard to shine
After last night, after last night it's hard to shine
After last night, after last night it's hard to shine
After last night I'm surprised the day even came
But it came, it came
A train of obscene images
Moving through the black hedge
Aching and thick with rust
All showing as soon as the sun comes up
It takes light to the paper
It burns its head and throat
Spreading a rash of arsenic
Magnolias and crushed coal
A fire in its heart
Will not let it die
It roars and fumes and cries all day
Shoot me out the sky
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
The shade came under the roses finally
Us on our backs in the back yard
Under the trees
Attempting to breathe
Attempting to see
Attempting to feel anything
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
The rain that claimed the sky as it shined
Pulled the shutters down on light
We sigh and sit and worship it as it ends
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
Pop pop! Down goes the enemy
Pop pop pop!
Pop pop pop pop!
After last night, after last night it's hard to shine
After last night, after last night it's hard to shineEmbed
