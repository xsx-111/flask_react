Jungle Jim LyricsI believe
I touch the tree
Circles upon circles rising
These are fingers
The canary sings
You are not the one
I crafted for myself
Just a broken toy
I'll replace you, for some deity
How I want you back
And your spirit around tonight
Share this one
Share this 
I see
You leaving a spot for me
You are not the one
I crafted for myself
Best a broken toy
 tooth and hip
 on my lips
Slip  to protect myself
Slip into smiles, show me 
Now there's nothing left
A dream of circumstance
I stay
I said to him
Why did you try?
He said we would climb
The child knowing too much
We said listen
We said listen
I thought I was strong remember
Gravity swallowed me
The cracks in the playground
Dreaming hands
Makes no sound
We lie dreaming again

I couldn't see you
A dirty little demon squeezing me out
Come outside
Done with one touch

Lying on my thighs
No I didn't come
Touch me
Honey fingers went inside
You looked most tempting
You love me you love me you love me you love me
But  and hurt me
You love me you love me you love me you love me
But you catch me after I've already hurt
You love me you love me you love me you love me
But you catch me after I've already hit the ground
I know you love me you love me you love me
But you catch me after I'm fallen and broken
And you left me lying...
You seeEmbed
