Tooth Fairy Retribution Manifesto LyricsBeing a kid it's like nothingness
You don't move you get pushed
No mystery from which to steer
Wide eyes blind
Sometime 

The color of blood
She left on the playground
Justice and a fist
And paper sugary things
Like smiles
In a handful of teeth
Ripped apart
 you'll know
It's always terrified me
 kissing the pillow
Doing it on the 
Comes to 
Come down on 
 shadows
Edging, scraping at you
Fear, heckling
Moving around you
I always feared the bloody ring
The broken flesh
The words without hearts
The human bodies like a predator
Grace
And then it comes
Huge
Dragon's ring
A dirty excuse
For an angel
Straw and black feathers
Clacking across the floor
Like change cracked from the guts
Of the tooth fairy
Wings of birds 
 broken flesh
It's fingerprint is sliding under the pillow
Lifts with its hands and extracts the gift
To pocket a piece of skull
And checks to see if the chest moves
If I knock out every toot
Of everyone who that tried to break my body
And covered them up with a pillow at night
For monsters to take
Then at dawn I'd be rich with pennies
And the blood left behindEmbed
