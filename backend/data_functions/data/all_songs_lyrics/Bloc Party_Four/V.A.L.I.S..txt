V.A.L.I.S. Lyrics
When in motion
World is frozen
Talks in circles and Greek
He's into epiphany
He's into philosophy
He's into methylamphetamines
He's into science
But he's lost his way
Oh-oh

He is not the real me
But I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear him
From my future

(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
Past and present
Are superimposed
He has seen this before
He's into conspiracy
He's into theophany
He's into phenomenology
He's into deeds
He don't mix his words
Oh-oh

He is not the real me
But I can hear, I can hear
I can hear, I can hear him
From my future

(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)

(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)
You've gotta show me the way
(Show, show, show, show me
Show, show, show, show me)

Show, show me
Show, show me
Show, show me1Embed
