Leaf Skeleton Lyrics
The journey starts
As all around, a battle rages on, battle rages on
Arjuna seeks
He throws his bow and conch up to the sky
Open your eyes, it's all around you, all around you

The pain that you're feeling
Goes some way to believing hope
The light from inside us
It goes on and on and on
On and on and on

It's in his hands
The glow of flame, the purest water, purest water
After he dies
He will rise on wings of true, the truest love
Open your eyes, it starts all over, starts all over

The pain that you're feeling
Goes some way to believing hope
The light from inside us
Goes some way to define us all
The pain that you're feeling
Goes some way to believing joy
The light from inside us
It goes on and on and on
On and on and on
Can you see the pattern?
Can you see the pattern?
Why can't you see the pattern?
Why can't you see the pattern?
Pattern?
Itâ€™s all around usEmbed
