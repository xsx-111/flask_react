Coliseum Lyrics
Got nightmare walking on two legs
There's a word for people like us
Can't shake the feeling we're moving backwards
History repeating itself
Ain't got time to prove, why even bother?
Just ignore the signs
Ain't got time to lose, can't change the drama
In time you'll see
The empire never ended

McSweeney draws first blood
Teeth hit the floor
Fingers twitch on the remote
The crowd want more, more, more
They're waiting for the ground-and-pound
To turn his face into raw meat
Little Johnny turns to mummy
"This is what I want to be"

Pain is hopeful
Pain is holy
Pain is healthy
Pain heals1Embed
