Real Talk Lyrics
Can we get real for a moment?
You're my one and only friend
Watch the sunset from your sedan
Let your hand rest on mine

I've lived in every town
But here is where I find home

My mind is open
And my body is yours
Show me the sign
Please

I was so sure, I was faulty
And not able to love
But then you crept up on me while I was dreaming
Whispered love into my ear

I've lived in every town
But here is where I find home
My mind is open
And my body is yours
Show me the sign

If you're tied up
I can drive up
We can go back
To my place

My mind is open
And my body is yours
Just show me the sign
My mind is open
My mind is open
Show me the sign
Please

Er, just talking about my feelings
I was fâ€“
Yeah, I was feeling my breast
Er, no, it, it was a turkey breast
I, I, I was keeping abreast of the, er, um, situationEmbed
