So He Begins to Lie Lyrics
We'll just do itâ€“ (What?)
Have you got it? Have you got that already?
Alright
I'm gonna do it again (Yeah)

The camera's watching
He takes a breath
Even though that they know that he knows
That they're on to him
He don't break a sweat
No

Oh
It grows and grows and grows inside of him
There's nothing there, there's nothing there
All along he knows
Those mirrors started to lie to him
His reflection faded

The crowd are waiting
He takes the stage
Cross his heart, hand on heart, open heart
That he's gone legit
He was never there
No
Oh
It grows and grows and grows inside of him
There's nothing there, there's nothing there
All along he knows
Those mirrors started to lie to him
His reflection faded

As easy as closing his eyes
So he begins to lie


The camera's watching
The camera's watching him lieEmbed
