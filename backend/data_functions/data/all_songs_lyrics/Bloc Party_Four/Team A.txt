Team A Lyrics
How many times
Do I have to tell you
That these are my things?
That these are my things?
Been running your mouth
But people been listening
Say, if you wanna throw down
We can go downtown
Any time, any damn time
Any time of the week

See I know that you're hating
Anticipating a breakthrough
I been there, done that, over with
Ain't nothing you can teach me
Ain't got no time for Le Baron
Ain't got no-no time for The Alibi
No, we ain't cool, boy, don't even try

I'm going to ruin your life
I'm going to ruin your life
I'm going to ruin your life
See, we ain't at school
Snitches get stitches
You might be fast, boy
But I'm faster than you
So let's make this clear
No misunderstandings
Better watch where you're walking
And watch what you say
Any time, any damn time
Any time of the week

See I know that you're hating
Anticipating a breakthrough
I been there, done that, over with
Ain't nothing you can teach me
Ain't got no time for Yo Yo
Ain't got no-no time for The Groucho
No, we ain't cool and you don't even know, even know

I'm going to ruin your life
I'm going to ruin your life
I'm going to ruin your life
I'm going to ruin your life

How many times
Do I have to tell you
That these are my things?
That these are my things?

I'm going to ruin your life
I'm going to ruin your life
I'm going to ruin your life
I'm going to ruin your life

The thing is: How would I know if it was a spider bite?
You want me to look it up?
Yes– er, yes, please
Er, a friend of mine at school once went to, um
When he came back from Mexico, he had all these strange bites
And when he squeezed them–
He had strange bites on his arm, it was quite swollen
And when he squeezed them, it popped
And out popped out, like, a bunch of baby spiders
It's a true storyEmbed
