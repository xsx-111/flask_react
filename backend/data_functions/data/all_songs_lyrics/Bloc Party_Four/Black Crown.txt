Black Crown Lyrics
"Because it's the rules"
Teacher said to boy
"Not my rules," he said, "No"
Talking in Ebonics, talking in italics
Talking, talking, talking, talking, talking, talking
Just remember

That you wear a crown (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
That you wear a crown (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

"Because it's the rules"
Policeman said to boy
"Not my rules," he said, "No"
Who will love the prophet? Who will love the madman?
Who will, who will, who will love the genius child?
Just remember

That you wear a crown (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
That you wear a crown (Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Charlie Parker
Cassius Clay
"Not my rules," they said
"No, no, no"
"Not my rules," they said
"No"Embed
