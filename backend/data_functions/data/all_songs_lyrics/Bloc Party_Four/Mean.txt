Mean Lyrics
Sometimes when you are sleeping
I wonder what you're dreaming
I wonder about your eyes and what they see
Yes, I know you're right
Always must win the fight
Who was I to think I'd have a chance?

What, what do you see?
When we're alone
Say what you mean
What (What), what do you feel? (What do you feel?)
When you turn away (When you turn away, turn away)
You're being mean

Sometimes when you are sleeping
I get the strangest feeling
Of all the things I could do whilst you lay
Gazing at your face
Makes me forget my faith
Who was I to think I'd stand a chance?

What, what do you see?
When we're alone
Say what you mean
What (What), what do you feel? (What do you feel?)
When you turn away (When you turn away, turn away)
You're being mean
Yes, I know you're right
Always must win the fight
Who was I to think I'd stand a chance?

What, what do you see?
When we're alone
Say what you mean
What (What), what do you feel? (What do you feel?)
When you turn away (When you turn away, turn away)
You're being meanEmbed
