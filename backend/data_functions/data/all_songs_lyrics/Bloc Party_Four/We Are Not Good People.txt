We Are Not Good People Lyrics
Think fast, boy, think on your feet
If you don't know now then you never will, never will
Oh, you're too young to be so heavy
Rip off the seal and let me school you

You see angels melt when they touch the ground
You see you're not dumb, you're just not aligned
Because you could be the one percent
If you wanna

We are not good people
We are not good people, no
We are not good people, no
We are not good people, no
This is a warning

If God is God, then why is he secret?
Today's the day you've been set free
Oh, they might claim the best things are hidden
But I was here, you came to me

With these five lines, you will be reborn
A superman or maybe a jock
You can crush the whole world in your palm
If you wanna
We are not good people
We are not good people, no
We are not good people, no
We are not good people, no
This is a warning

You see angels melt when they touch the ground
(We've got the doorway)
You see you're not dumb, you're just not aligned
(We've got the hallway)
Because you could be the one percent
(You can't restore yourself)
If you wanna

We are not good people
We are not good people, no
We are not good people, no
We are not good people, no
This is a warningEmbed
