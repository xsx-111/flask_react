Truth Lyrics
It was the truth
That fell from these lips
It blinded us
And then the darkness left

So I am yours now
Respectfully
I am yours now
Truthfully
Truthfully

It burnt the stain
Left on my mind
Our hearts, our hearts, they beat
A quarter-tone apart

'Cause I am yours now
Respectfully (Why can't I do it? I do it? You complete me)
I am yours now
Truthfully (Why can't I do it? I do it? You complete me)

Oh-oh, our kind is hard, hard
To find, to find
And if it will be
It will be with you
I am yours now
Respectfully (Why can't I do it? I do it? You complete me)
I am yours now
Truthfully (Why can't I do it? I do it? You complete me)2Embed
