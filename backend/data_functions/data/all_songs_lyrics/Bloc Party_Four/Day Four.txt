Day Four Lyrics
It's in the trees
It's in the leaves
This time I know
That I'll stay clean
Anything it gives
Anything it gives it will take back
The city's here for you

My light burns low
And I know it's running out
They say, stay brave
But I know it will return

I've felt death
Rising from me
From my fingers
And out my mouth
If youâ€™re ever lonely
If you are alone, stay that way
The city's here for you

My light burns low
And I know it's running out
They say, stay brave
But I know it will return
On the fourth day
On the fourth day
On the fourth day
On day four1Embed
