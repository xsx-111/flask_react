Octopus Lyrics
It hid and it hid in his bedroom
Psycho killer, teen dream, action film
Gonna show you how we get down in my hood
Bubbling and bubbling, the cheap champagne
Leyendecker, hole wrecker, feel no pain
Lying face down when I swing your way, and what?
What's my name? What's my name?

Mary Anna
Said it's a no-go
She don't feel like
She don't think so
But I don't know why
I feel like crying
Well, come on, come on
Say come on

They ran and they ran from his classroom
Roll another forty, make them scream
Gonna show you how we do things in my hood
Tripping and a-tripping then erase the tapes
John Wayne, Rob Roy, feel no pain
This is the point where you look the other way
You done lost your mind

Mary Anna
Said it's a no-go
She don't feel like
She don't think so
But I don't know why
I feel like crying
Well, come on, come on
Say come on
Come on


Mary Anna
Said it's a no-go
She don't feel like
She don't think so
But I don't know why
I feel like crying
Well, come on, come on
Say come on
Come on2Embed
