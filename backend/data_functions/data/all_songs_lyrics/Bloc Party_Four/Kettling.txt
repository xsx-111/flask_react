Kettling Lyrics
We smashed the window
Po-po don't fuck around
As their cameras take pictures of us
We just laugh
We laugh

Because they can't stop this
We can feel it in our bones
We can feel, we can feel
The future's ours
Yes, it is
We can feel it in our bones

We drop the lighter
Into the gas
If the whole world is watching us
Let them watch
Let them watch

Because they can't stop this
We can feel it in our bones
We can feel, we can feel
The future's ours
Yes, it is
We can feel it in our bones
We can feel
We can feel it in our bones

Because they can't stop this
We can feel it in our bones
We can feel, we can feel it
The future's ours
Yes, it is
We can feel it in our bones
We can feel
We can feel it in our bonesEmbed
