The Healing Lyrics
Calm down, let the world spin 'round
There ain't no other place to be
Take this lifeline
Skin tears, but the flesh will weave
Back together again
Only scars now

And go easy, just be
As life gets longer
Got all the time you need
And stay with me, my dear
As life gets harder
Whatever strikes, you'll heal
You will heal

Breathe out, let it come around
Let your colours return
Turn a corner
Every time he barks, just shut the devil out
Let these arms embrace
You know I'm down

And go easy, just be
As life gets longer
Got the all the time you need
And stay with me, my dear
As life gets harder
Whatever strikes, you'll heal
You will heal

And stay with me, my dear
As life gets harder
Whatever strikes, you'll heal
You will heal

You will heal
You will heal2Embed
