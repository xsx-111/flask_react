3x3 Lyrics
Three times three
First cut fast
Pierce the skin
It binds us
Spit, cum, blood
A liquid wax
No one loves you
No one loves you
No one loves you
As much as us

By all in me that's holy
By all in me that's blessed
I made to you a promise
That this is forever and ever, amen

Three times three
Lose all fear
Let the flames
Dry those tears
It takes hurt
To be pure
Now you're one of
Now you're one of
Now you're one of
You're one of us
By all in me that's holy
By all in me that's blessed
I made to you a promise
That this is forever and ever, amen

No means no
No means no
No means no
No means no
No means no
No means no
No (Yes)
No (Yes)
No (Yes)
No (Yes)
