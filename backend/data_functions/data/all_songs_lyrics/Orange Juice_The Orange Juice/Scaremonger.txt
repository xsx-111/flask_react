Scaremonger LyricsI tend to shy away from people like you
People who want much more than they really ought to
Somehow I was taken in, attended to your every whim but...
It needn't always be that way
It needn't always be that way
It needn't always be that way
I was misguided but now I'm back on course
Now I've decided I'm filing for divorce
I wouldn't give you so much as the time of day but...
It needn't always be that way
It needn't always be that way
It needn't always be that way
And you're a scare monger, you're dealing in fear
You take such delight in the plight of others
I shudder to think that we were once like brothers
And granted I'm dealing in clichés but for that I make no apologies
'Cause some things just have to be said
You're a scaremonger, you're dealing in fearEmbed
