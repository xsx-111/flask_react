Lean Period LyricsI want to testify, my love is bona-fide
This is the real thing, not just a casual fling
But please don't expect consistency from me
I've been maimed and I've been chained before you see
But right now I'm
Going through a lean period
A decidedly mean period
Let's talk things over in the 'Old Rover'
Let's drown our sorrows like there's no more tomorrows
All those words that I have wasted in haste
Have left such a bitter aftertaste
The reason being I'm
Going through a lean period
A decidedly mean period
This joke I've made at my own expense
Has long since worn thin
And yet by way of recompense
You respond with a wink and a knowing grin
Going through a lean period
A decidedly mean periodEmbed
