Out for the Count LyricsOnce I had a vision and that vision was intense
And if I'm talking like a mystic let me say in my defence
I was out for the count and when I awoke
I was laughing uncontrollably as one might at a joke
I dreamt of Bobbie Gentry with her warm, enchanting smile
She said she'd never fall in love again, at least not for a while
She was out for the count and when she awoke
She was laughing uncontrollably as one might at a joke
Venus, she was lying in state, a wreath placed at her side
So I asked her 'Why so tight lipped?' when there was nothing left to hide
She was out for the count and when she awoke
She was laughing uncontrollably as one might at a jokeEmbed
