The Artisans LyricsI used to spend each afternoon
Just locked in the confines of my room
'Cause my mother told me that I never should
Play with the gypsies down in the wood
Then I fell in with a bunch of hoods
Who go by the name of the 'Artisans'
Gonna trade in my snakeskin boots
Gonna trade in my rhinestone suit
'Cause I'm in cahoots with the 'Artisans'
Who just happen to be my favourite band
At the best all the rest are just 'also rans'
When compared to the fabulous 'Artisans'Embed
