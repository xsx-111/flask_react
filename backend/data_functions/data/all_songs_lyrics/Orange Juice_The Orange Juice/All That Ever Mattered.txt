All That Ever Mattered LyricsIt may sound corny
But you were all that ever mattered
And I can still hear your laughter
As it echoes through the years
I live for chance we meet again
Please don’t pass me by
If a body meets a body
Coming through the rye
You see, I never realized
Till’ our demise
How much you meant to me
No, I never realized
Till’ our demise
How much you meant to me
I tell ya, I never realized
Till’ our demise
How much you meant to me
No, I never realized
Till’ our demise
How much you meant to me
You were all that ever mattered
And in the aftermath
You just gotta laugh at it all
Then we have ourselves a ball
Painting the town
Allured dread then
Home to the warmth of my makeshift bed
I never realized
Till’ our demise
How much you meant to me
No, I never realized
Till’ our demise
How much you meant to me
I never realized
Till’ our demiseEmbed
