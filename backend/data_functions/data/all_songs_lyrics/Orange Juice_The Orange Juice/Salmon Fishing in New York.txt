Salmon Fishing in New York LyricsI saw you in your wetsuit
We were watching from the shower
Spitting contentiously
Like the wild cat that you are
Like the wild cat of Scotland
Both exclusive and elusive
They'll never capture you
Believe me, they want to
That'll be like trying to catch a salmon in New York
That'll be like trying to catch a salmon in New York
So now, you stand on Broadway
Both bemused and confused
And they've come to steal your beauty
Your fierce, Celtic beauty
But they'll never capture you
Believe me, they want to
That'll be like trying to catch a salmon in New York
That'll be like trying to catch a salmon in New York
In some parts of the world
They still hold to believe
That a camera can steal your soul
And I go along with that
Lock, stock and barrel
But they'll never capture you
Believe me, they want to
That'll be like trying to catch a salmon in New York
That'll be like trying to catch a salmon in New YorkEmbed
