What Presence?! Lyrics
It may be my imagination
And of course I'm prone to exaggeration
But in the moth-eaten gloom of my shabby room
I saw the strangest manifestation
One possible explanation
Is that it was merely a trick of the light
But that's little consolation
'Cause it's gotten so that I can't sleep at night

What presence?!
What presence?!

Steppin' out 'neath a harvest moon
Steppin' out to the strains of this self-same tune
And it's screaming in my ears
Yes, it's screaming in my ears
And I'm holding back the tears
'Cause it's screaming in my ears

What presence?!
What presence?!
What presence?!
What presence?!
What presence?!
What?
What you gonna do when the river runs dry?
What you gonna do when the river runs dry?
What you gonna do when the river runs dry?
What you gonna do when the river runs, river runs dry?
(What you gonna do when the river runs dry?)
And there's a harvest moon in the sky
And I can't believe my eyes
'Cause the river's running dry
No, I can't believe my eyes
'Cause the river's running dry
(What you gonna do when the river runs dry?)Embed
