Tomorrow Night LyricsCrane
When I wake up in your bed
I can still hear what you said
Like a bad dream I can't fight
Tomorrow night
Am I lying next to you?
Am I thinking I need to
Really love you? Do it right
Tomorrow night
Time goes so slow when you're gone
Days turn to years, it seems so long
If you still feel like today
If tomorrow's the same way
Then I know it'll be right
Tomorrrow night
Can't you trust me to see it through?
Can't you wait 'till I see you?
When you're working, you're uptight
Tomorrow night
Time goes so slow when you're gone
Days turn to years, it's seem so long
When I wake up in your bed
I can still hear what you said
Like a bad dream I can't fight
Tomorrow night
Am I lying next to you?
Am I thinking I need to
Really love you? Oh do it right
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow night
Tomorrow nightEmbed
