7 Streets LyricsSeven Lonely Streets, Walking All Alone
Never Needing No One, Always On My Own
Since I Left The World, To Live My Own Way
People I Don't See, No One's In My Day
In My Sleep I hear, But My Eyes Can't See
Photos Of My Past, Of My Life To Be
Ear Faced To The Wind To See All I Can Hear
The Days Would Be So Long, Seven Streets I Fear
Seven Lonely Streets I'm Walking All On My Own
Seven Days I Weep, Oh All Alone,So All Alone
Seven Lonely Streets, On My Own
Seven Lonely Streets, Walking All Alone
Never Needing No One, Always On My Own
Since I Left The World, To Live My Own Way
People I Don't See, No One's In My Day
Seven Lonely Streets, I'm Walking All Alone
Seven Days I Plead, All On My OwnEmbed
