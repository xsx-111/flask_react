Death Walks Behind You LyricsDuCann-Crane
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind you
Lock the door, switch the light
You'll be so afraid tonight
Hide away from the bad
Count the nine lives that you had
Start to scream, shout for help
There is no one by your side
To forget what is done
Seems so hard to carry on
Luck is false, that it's near
Bring yourself to understand
It's your fate or what's cast
Point a finger at yourself
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind you
Lock your door, switch the light
You'll be so afraid tonight
Hide away from the bad
Count the nine lives that you had
Start to scream, shout for help
There is no one by your side
To forget what is done
Seems so hard to carry on
Seems so hard to carry on
Carry on
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind you
Death walks behind youEmbed
