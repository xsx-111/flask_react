Sleeping for Years Lyrics
Open your eyes, the day is growing near
Wasted away, sleeping off the years

Been around, stuck around far too long
Run away, hide away, I was wrong
Couldn't see, only me, ah too bad
Now I know, how I know, you'll stay the same

Give what you have, can I know when I
Left it too late? Guess I'll never know just why, oh



What did I lose, going my way?
Taking no more, the light from my day
