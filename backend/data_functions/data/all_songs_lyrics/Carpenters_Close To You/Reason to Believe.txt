Reason to Believe LyricsIf I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it’s all true
Knowing that you lied
Straight faced while I cried
And still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you
Makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you
Makes it easy to give, never thinking of myself
If you’d took the time to change my mind
I'd find a way to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied
Straight faced while I cried
And still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you
Makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you
Makes it easy to give, never thinking of myself
If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it’s all true
Knowing that you lied
Straight faced while I cried
And still I'd look to find a reason to believe
Someone like you
Makes it hard to live without somebody else
Someone like you
Makes it easy to give, never thinking of myselfEmbed
