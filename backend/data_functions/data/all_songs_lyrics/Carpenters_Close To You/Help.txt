Help LyricsWhen I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured
Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I you do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
And every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I you do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, please help me?
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I you do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me, please help me?Embed
