I Kept On Loving You LyricsI ran away from you and left you crying
And though I'm back to stay you think I'm lying
But I've changed my ways and my wandering days are through
And through it all I kept on loving you
Don't worry, baby, please don’t cry
I'm home for good and I will never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
You must believe me and I will never leave you
Never leave you
You've heard this all before, I can't deny it
The road was long and wide, I had to try it
Though I love you, girl, these were things I had to do
But through it all I kept on loving you
Don't worry, baby, please don’t cry
I'm home for good and I will never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
You must believe me and I will never leave you
Never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don’t cry
I'm home for good and I will never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
You must believe me and I will never leave you
Never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don’t cry
I'm home for good and I will never leave you
Don't worry, baby, please don't cry
You must believe me and I will never leave you
Never leave youEmbed
