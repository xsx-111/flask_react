Mr. Guder Lyrics
Mister Guder, say Mister Guder
May I have a moment with you?
For there is something I’ve got to say
And please don't let it scare you away

Mister Guder, say Mister Guder
I have seen you go through a day
You're everything a robot lives for
Walk in at nine and roll out the door at five

You reflect the company image
You maintain their rules to live by
Shine your shoes, let’s keep a neat haircut
Now that you're wearing a coat and tie

Mister Guder, say Mister Guder
Some day soon you may realise
You've blown your life just playing a game
Where no one wins but everyone stays the same

You reflect the company image
You maintain their rules to live by
Shine your shoes, let’s keep a neat haircut
Now that you're wearing a coat and tie
Mister Guder, say Mister Guder
Some day soon you may realise
You've blown your life just playing a game
Where no one wins but everyone stays the same

Please play your game
Stay the sameEmbed
