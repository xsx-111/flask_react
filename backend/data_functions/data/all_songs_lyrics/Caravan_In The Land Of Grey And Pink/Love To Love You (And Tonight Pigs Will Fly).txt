Love To Love You (And Tonight Pigs Will Fly) Lyrics
I dreamed of all the magic things that be
When we'd ride to a dock on bended knee
But you'd just smile and gently shake your head
And put a hole through me so I was dead
Oh, I'd fall down and I was left alone (Aaah)
With a feeling of you still that was my own (Aaah)

Oh, I would love to, love to love you
Yes, indeed, I do love you, love you
My my, pigs might fly - that can't be bad
How you have the cheek to smile and tell me I'm mad

A man came through the wall and stood by me
Complete with bag of nuts and fancy free
He said without a tonal fleeting glance
"I'd like to get deep down inside your pants"
How you opened up his head and smiled
And rubbish from your mouth you tipped inside

Oh, I would love to, love to love you
Yes, indeed, I do love you, love you
My my, pigs might fly - that can't be bad
How you have the cheek to smile and tell me I'm mad
Oh, I would love to, love to love you
Yes, indeed, I do love you, love you
My my, pigs might fly - that can't be bad
How you have the cheek to smile and tell me I'm mad

Oh, I would love to, love to love you
Yes, indeed, I do love you, love you
My my, pigs might fly - that can't be bad
How you have the cheek to smile and tell me I'm madEmbed
