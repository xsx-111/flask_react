In the Land of Grey and Pink Lyrics
In the land of grey and pink
Where only boy-scouts stop to think
They'll be coming back again
Those nasty grumbly grimblies
And they're climbing down your chimney
Yes, they're trying to get in
Come to take your money
Isn't it a sin
They're so thin

They've black buckets in the sky
Don't leave your dad in the rain
Cigarettes burn bright tonight
They'll all get washed down the drain

So we'll sail away for just one day
To the land where the punk weed grows
You won't need any money
Just fingers and your toes
And when it's dark our boat will park
On a land of warm and green
Pick our fill of punk weed
And smoke it till we bleed
That's all we'll need
While sailing back in morning light
We'll wash our teeth in the sea
And when the day gets really bright
We'll go to sea drinking tea

So we'll sail away for just one day
To the land where the punk weed grows
You won't need any money
Just fingers and your toes
And when it's dark our boat will park
On a land of warm and green
Pick our fill of punk weed
And smoke it till we bleed
That's all we'll need

They've black buckets in the sky
Don't leave your dad in the rain
Cigarettes burn bright tonight
They'll all get washed down the drain1Embed
