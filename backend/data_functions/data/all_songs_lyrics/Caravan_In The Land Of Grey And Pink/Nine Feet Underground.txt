Nine Feet Underground Lyrics

Look at the day that is dawning
What do you see with your eyes?
Think of me now while you're yawning
Sunshine the tears from my cries
What I see I know is real
What I touch I know I feel
If I don't care for what you say
It won't mean much to me today
For I see your world that is living
My mind is yours, yours is mine
Don't talk to me 'bout forgiving
So much to do, no more time
All my love goes straight to you
With just a thought for something new
All I have is what you feel
With hands in mouth, you gently kneel
What I see I know is real
What I touch I know I feel
All my love goes straight to you
All my love is you




There's a place where I can go
Where I listen to the wind singing
Songs of happiness I know
And it brings it all back again
Somewhere deep inside of me
There's a song that I can sing
Jigsaw puzzles on a tree
And it brings it all back again
Will the day be warm and bright, or will it snow?
There are people waiting here who really want to know
And sometimes I think of wine
Songs and laughter flowing free
People talking all the time
And it brings it all back to me
Will the day be warm and bright, or will it snow?
There are people waiting now who really have to know
Can't you feel it in the air?
I wonder what it's meant to be
It's the thought that can despair
And it brings it all back to me
Yes it brings it all back to me
