Believe What You Say LyricsI believe what you say, when you say
You're goin' steady with nobody else but me
I believe what you say, when you say
You don't kiss nobody else but me
I believe, do believe, I believe
Yeah, I believe, pretty baby, believe
You're goin' steady with nobody else but me
Well, there's one thing, baby, that I want you to know
When you're rockin' with me don't rock too slow
Move on in, get toe-to-toe
We're gonna rock till we can't rock no more
I believe, do believe, I believe
Yeah, I believe, pretty baby, believe
You're goin' steady with nobody else but me
Well, let's dig it now
Well, I believe what you say, when you say
You don't miss nobody else but me
I believe what you say, when you say
You don't kiss nobody else but me
I believe, do believe, I believe
Yeah, I believe, pretty baby, believe
You're goin' steady with nobody else but me
Well, when you kiss me, baby, then you roll your eyes
I get a funny feelin' that I'm hypnotized
Chills run all up and down my spine
I'm tellin' everybody that you're mine, all mine
I believe, do believe, I believe
Oh, I believe, pretty baby, believe
You're goin' steady with nobody else but me
Oh, yeah
Well, I believe, do believe, yeah believe
Well, believe, pretty baby, believe
You're goin' steady with nobody else but meEmbed
