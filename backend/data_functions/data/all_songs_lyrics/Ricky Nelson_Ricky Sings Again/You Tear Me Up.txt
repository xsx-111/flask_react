You Tear Me Up LyricsYou just tear me up when you smile at me
And then my head starts buzzin' like a honey bee
My eyes won't focus and I'm so upset
I sit here shakin' in a cold, cold sweat
You're makin' a fool out of me
That's pretty easy to see
You just tear me up everytime we kiss
I never thought that love could ever be like this
I guess you know that I'm in love with you
I wish you'd tell me that you love me too
You're foolin' around with my heart
Please don't you tear me apart
Everytime you kiss me
I tremble like a little ol' pup
When you put your arms around me
Baby, you tear me up
I just wanna know if you love me too
'Cause if you leave me now
I don't know what I'll do
I'm so in love that I can hardly speak
My head is spinnin' and I'm feelin' weak
So won't you consider my plea
Don't take advantage of me
Everytime you kiss me
I tremble like a little ol' pup
When you put your arms around me
Baby, you tear me up
I just wanna know if you love me too
'Cause if you leave me now
I don't know what I'll do
I'm so in love that I can hardly speak
My head is spinnin' and I'm feelin' weak
So won't you consider my plea
Don't take advantage of me
No don't take advantage of me
Don't take advantage of meEmbed
