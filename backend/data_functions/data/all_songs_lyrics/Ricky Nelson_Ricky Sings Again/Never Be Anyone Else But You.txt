Never Be Anyone Else But You LyricsThere'll never be anyone else
But you for me
Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you
If I could take my pick
Of all the girls I've ever known
Then I'd come and pick you
Out to be my very own
There'll never be anyone else
But you for me
Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you
A heart that's true and longs for you
Is all I have to give
All my love belongs to you
As long as I may live
There'll never be anyone else
But you for me
Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you
I never will forget the way you kiss me
And when we're not together
I wonder if you've missed me
'Cause I hope and pray
The day will come
When you belong to me
Then I'm gonna prove to you
How true my love can be
There'll never be anyone else
But you for me
Never ever be
Just couldn't be
Anyone else but you
