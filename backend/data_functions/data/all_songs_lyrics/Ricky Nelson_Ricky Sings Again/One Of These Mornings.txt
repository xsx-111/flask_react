One Of These Mornings LyricsWell one of these morning's I'm gonna rise an' shine
And get a one way ticket, I'm gonna leave behind
All of my troubles and misery
I'm gonna find me a gal that's gonna love me, oh yeah
I wanna be their soon
Making love to some sweet gal by the light of the moon
If you wanna go with me, then you better be packed
Leavin' one of these mornings, on a one way track
There'll be singin' and dancin' and sweet romancin'
Huggin' and a kissin', that's what I've been missin'
From my baby who found someone new
I done told my gal what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna leave on a one way track
Yes one of these mornings and I can't comin' back
Come along and go with me, but you can't be late
'Cause one of these mornings that train won't waitEmbed
