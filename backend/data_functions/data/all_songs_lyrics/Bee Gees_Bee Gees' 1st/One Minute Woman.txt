One Minute Woman LyricsOne minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you"
I fail to understand
Why you don't want my hand
I try to find what's on your mind
I wonder
Why don't you stop and see
Why you're not loving me
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
Or don't you know?
One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you"
Why don't you stop and see
Why you're not loving me:
Would it hurt to say "Hello"
Or don't you know?
One minute, women, please
I'd go down on my knees
To say to you with a word so true
"I love you, I love you. I love you"Embed
