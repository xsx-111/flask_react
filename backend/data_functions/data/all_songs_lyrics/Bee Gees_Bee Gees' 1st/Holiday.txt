Holiday Lyrics (Robin Gibb)
Ooh you're a holiday, such a holiday
Ooh you're a holiday, such a holiday
 (Robin Gibb)
It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones
 (Robin Gibb)
Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Can't think what I've just said
Put the soft pillow on my head
 (Robin Gibb)
Millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind
 (Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb)
De, de de de de de
De de de de de de, de de
De, de de de de de
De de de de de de, de de
 (Barry, Robin & Maurice)
Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
It's unkind, it's unkind
 (Robin Gibb)
Ooh you're a holiday
Every day, such a holiday
Now it's my turn to say
And I say you're a holiday
 (Robin Gibb)
It's something I think's worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones
 (Barry, Robin & Maurice)
De, de de de de de
De de de de de de, de de
De, de de de de de
De de de de de deEmbed
