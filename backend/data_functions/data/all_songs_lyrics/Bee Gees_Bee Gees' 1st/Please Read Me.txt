Please Read Me LyricsMany years ago I was a simple man
A simple man, no worries me
I never lied
Please read me
Not much conversation ever came from me
I never saw reality
I never tried
Please read me
Ah....
Maybe I've been lying on your couch too long
I'll stay if you can see me through, explain why
Please read me (x3)Embed
