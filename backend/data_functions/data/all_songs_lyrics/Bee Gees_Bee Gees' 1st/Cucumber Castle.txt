Cucumber Castle Lyrics
There were the trees, see the grass, a Pinkerton spy
Said "This is the place I will try," and he did
Stood in the dark, sat a man who beckoned him in
But leaving his grass was a sin, but he did

Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
He saw the light in the cellar reflect in his eyes
Yet early that morning was he to receive a surprise

Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home

Said "Are you leaving or are you receiving my friend
Doest need any money till then" and he did
He said "I'm the owner,not you, and this is my stead
So give it to me now I'm dead, and he did , said:
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's home
Cucumber Castle be ever so humble it's homeEmbed
