In My Own Time LyricsI received an invitation
'Come to the United Nations'
That was when I was somebody
In my own time
Sitting selling hot cross buns
Thousand suckers everyone
Sounds just like a nursery rhyme
In my own time
Even when the lights go out
Still got things to think about
Memories I can't call mine
In my own time
My own time
My own timeEmbed
