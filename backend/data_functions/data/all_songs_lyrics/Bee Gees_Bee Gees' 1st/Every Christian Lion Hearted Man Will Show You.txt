Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You LyricsOh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Take this in hand
Said he who stands
Behind the chair
A broken table there
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Don't walk so tall
Before you crawl
For every child
Is thinking of something wild
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Every Christian lion hearted man will show you
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo Dominique
Oh solo DominiqueEmbed
