Heartbeat LyricsShe's a heartbeat
Yeah, she's a heartbeat
She's a door at the end of a dead end street
She's a heartbeat
And footsteps
I hear her footsteps
Here comes rumours and lies
Here comes my life of crime
I hear footsteps
When the music goes down
And the traffic is stopped
And nobody talks at all
When they turn up the town
I hear a heartbeat
And I've shut all the shades
And the radio stops
And nobody moves at all
When the city's asleep
I hear a heartbeat
I hear a heartbeat
In the shadows
Out in the shadows
It's like walking on glass
It's the end of the show
In the shadows
And sweet dreams
She sells you sweet dreams
It's like movies and trash
Where there's always a girl
And she's sweet dreams
When the music goes down
And the traffic is stopped
And nobody talks at all
When they turn up the town
I hear a heartbeat
And i've shut all the shades
And the radio stops
And nobody moves at all
When the city's asleep
I hear a heartbeat
I hear a heartbeat
She's a heartbeat
Yeah, she's a heartbeat
She's a door at the end of a dead end street
She's a heartbeat
And sweet dreams
She sells you sweet dreams
It's like movies and trash
Where there's always a girl
And she's sweet dreams
When the music goes down
And the traffic is stopped
And nobody talks at all
When they turn up the town
I hear a heartbeat
And i've shut all the shades
And the radio stops
And nobody moves at all
When the city's asleep
I hear a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I hear a heartbeat
When they turn up the town
I hear a heartbeat
Heartbeat, I hear a heartbeat
When the music goes down
I hear a heartbeat
