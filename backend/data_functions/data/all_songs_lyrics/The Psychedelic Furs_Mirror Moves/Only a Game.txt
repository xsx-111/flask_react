Only a Game LyricsYeah we're in on the act
And love's in the back
With all of your roses and you
Yeah you you you
A high heeled girl
And we talk just like jazz
Like a song from the edge
And we move like a piece of the times
For you you you
A high heeled girl
High heeled girl
The party goes on til it's late
And there's nobody home
And i look in your face
And i see that i'm here all alone
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only part of the act
And love's in the back
And everything's fun fun fun
We're so loose for you
Won't you stay?
They're just winding me up
To take me away
With a face full of plans
And a dangerous game
We're a two minute hit for a day
For you you you
A high heeled girl
With your rings and your drums
And a day at a time
And a foot on the floor of your love
It's you you you
A high heeled girl
High heeled girl
The party goes on til it's late
And there's nobody home
And i look in your face
And i see that i'm here all alone
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only part of the act
And love's in the back
And everything's fun fun fun
We're so loose for you
Won't you stay?
They're just winding me up
To take me away
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a game
And it's only a gameEmbed
