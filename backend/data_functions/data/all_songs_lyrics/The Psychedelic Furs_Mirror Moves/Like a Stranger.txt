Like a Stranger LyricsNothing goes on today
She says
All of our running 'round
To get away
Yes and it's complicated
Some now
And some later
One of the girls
You'd have to say
And you talk like a stranger
You hurt for a change
And they ease you
And cool you
And love you so strange
And you talk like a stranger
You hurt for a change
And they ease you
And cool you
And love you so strange yeah
Oh when she's lonely
She says
Out of a face that tells you
Take me home
Yes and she keeps on talking
It's no blind and sleep walking
One of the girls
You'd have to say
And you talk like a stranger
You hurt for a change
And they ease you
And cool you
And love you so strange
And you talk like a stranger
You hurt for a change
And they ease you
And cool you
And love you so strange yeah
And you talk like a stranger
You hurt for a changeand they ease you
And cool you
And love you so strange
And you talk like a stranger
You hurt for a change
And they ease you
And cool you
And love you so strange
And you talk like a stranger
You talk like a stranger todayEmbed
