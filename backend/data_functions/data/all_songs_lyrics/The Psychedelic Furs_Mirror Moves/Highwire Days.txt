Highwire Days LyricsThey tore up our kisses and ran
On tomorrow's pages
And the lions have eaten the lamb
On tomorrow's pages
There's a day of your life in your handful of people you don't understand
In my highwire days (Get smart, get scared)
I can see all the way (Get lost, who cares?)
I see through the games you play (Get..., get...)
In my highwire days (Big town, big city)
They pushed all the buttons and things
On tomorrow's pages
And the sirens do nothing but sing
On tomorrow's pages
And you put on your prettiest face and you wait for the news that we made
Our dreams have all gone up on sale
On tomorrow's pages
And we paid for the cross and the nails
On tomorrow's pages
And we put on out prettiest face and we wait for the news that we made
That's itEmbed
