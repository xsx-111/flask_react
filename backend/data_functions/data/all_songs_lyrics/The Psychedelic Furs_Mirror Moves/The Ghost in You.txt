The Ghost in You Lyrics
A man in my shoes runs a light
And all the papers lied tonight
But falling over you
Is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
And love, love, love, love is all of heaven away (Love, love, love)

Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)
Inside you the time moves (It's coming down)
And she don't fade (To losing it in you)

A race is on, I'm on your side
And hearing you, my engines die
I'm in a mood for you
For running away
Stars come down in you
And love, love, love, you can't give it away (love, love, love, love)

Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)
Inside you the time moves (It's coming down)
And she don't fade (To losing it in you)
Don't you go
It makes no sense
When all your talking supermen
Just take away the time
And get in the way
Ain't it just like rain?
And love, love, love, love is only heaven away (love, love, love, love)

Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)

Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)

Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)
Inside you the time moves (It's coming down)
And she don't fade (To losing it in you)Embed
