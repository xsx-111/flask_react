Goshen Lyrics
You're on in five
It's time you rise
Or fade
They've gone before
Stood by your door
All day
For what it's worth
Defend your kind
From shame
The lights are down
Go on inside
They've paid

You're the face in stone
Through the land I own
You never found it home
You're not the girl I used to know
What would you hide from such a glow?
If I had only told you so...

You're on in five
It's time you rise
Or fade
They've gone before
Stood by your door
All day
But you never found it home
A fair price I pay to be alone
What would you hide from such a glory, oh
If I had only told you so3Embed
