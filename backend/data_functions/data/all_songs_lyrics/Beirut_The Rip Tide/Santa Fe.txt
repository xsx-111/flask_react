Santa Fe Lyrics
Your days in one
This day undone
(The kind that breaks under)
All day at once
(For me, for you)
I'm just too young
(And what of my heart)

This day was once
(Silence before)
All grace of lost
Can't wait at all
(Can't wait at all)
Temptation won

And whatever comes through the door
I'll see it face to face
All by your place

Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
Sign me up Santa Fe
On the cross Santa Fe
And all I want
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
And I and I and I alone want you to know
And I and I and I alone
And I and I and I alone want you to know
And I and I and I alone

Your days in one
This day undone
(The kind that breaks under)
All day at once
(For me, for you)
I'm just too young
(And what of my heart)

Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
Sign me up Santa Fe
On the cross Santa Fe
And all I want
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son3Embed
