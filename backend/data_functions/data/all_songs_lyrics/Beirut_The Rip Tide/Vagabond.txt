Vagabond Lyrics
Left a bag of bones
A trail of stones
For to find my way home
Now, as the air grows cold
The trees unfold
And I am lost
And not found

And who'd know
Who'd know?
Who'd know
Who'd know?
And who'd know
Who'd know
Who'd know?
Who'd know...
Oh

Now, left a bag of bones
A trail of stones
For to find my way home
Now, as the air grows cold
The trees unfold
And I am lost
And not found
Now, left a bag of bones
A trail of stones
For to find my way home
Now, as the air grows cold
The truth unfolds
And I am lost
And not found
