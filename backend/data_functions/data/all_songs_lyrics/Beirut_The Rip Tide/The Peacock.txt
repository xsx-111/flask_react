The Peacock LyricsThere's an answer, for I'm called again
Back in the sand, just like those soldier men
And, even once I fell down in the narrow lanes
On the ground I lay
And I would say
Infernal heat, can't take the sound in here
Shake the trees, see what falls out of them
In a city where nobody hears
A bird call, fine, fine; winter's here again
Calls and sings; Berlin, Berlin
Among the camp, we're done with him
We'd shoot him down
But then, but then...
Where should I begin, begin..
He's the only one who knows the words
He's the only one who knows the words
He's the only one who knows the words
He's the only one who knows the words
He's the only one who knows the words
He's the only one who knows the words
He's the only one who knows the words
He's the only one who knows the words
He's the only one who knows the words2Embed
