Port of Call Lyrics
And I
I called through the air that night
I couldn't see your voice without light
I could only smile
I've been alone some time
And all in all
It's been fine

And you
You had hope for me, now
I danced all around it somehow
Be fair to me
I may drift awhile
Were it up to me
You'd know why

I
I called through the air that night
The thoughts was warming inside
Was it infantile?
That which we desire
Were it up to me
Pull the wool from your eyes
And I
I called through the air that night
My thoughts were still buried in time
We were closer then
I'd been alone some time
Filled your glass with gin
Filled your heart with pride

And you
You had hope for me, now
I danced all around it somehow

Be fair to me
I may drift awhile
If there's a plan for me
Would it make you smile?

No
Don't want to be there for nobody
I'd stay here
No
Don't want to be there for no one
That's over the sea
I don't want to follow your light
On the sea
No
Don't want to be there for no one
That I can't see1Embed
