The Rip Tide Lyrics
And this is the house where I
I feel alone
Feel alone, now
And this is the house where I
Could be unknown
Be alone, now

So the waves and I
Found the rolling tide
Soon the waves and I
Found the rip tide

And this is the house where I
I feel alone
Feel alone, now
And this is the house where I
Could be unknown
Be alone, now

So the waves and I
Found the rolling tide
Soon the waves and I
Found the rip tide
So the waves and I
Found the rolling tide
Soon the waves and I
Found the rip tide11Embed
