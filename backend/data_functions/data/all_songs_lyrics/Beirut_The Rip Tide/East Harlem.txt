East Harlem Lyrics
Another rose wilts in East Harlem
And uptown downtown
A thousand miles between us
She's waiting for the night to fall
Let it fall, I'll never make it in time

Another rose wilts in East Harlem
And uptown downtown
A thousand miles between us
She's waiting for the night to fall
Let it fall, I'll never make it in time
Another rose wilts in East Harlem
And uptown downtown
A thousand miles between us
She's waiting for the night to fall
Let it fall, I'll never make it in time

Sound is the color I know, oh
Sound is what keeps me before your eyes
And sound of your breath in the cold
And oh, the sound will bring me home again
Sound is the color I know, oh
Sound is what keeps me before your eyes
And sound of your breath in the cold
And oh, the sound will bring me home again
