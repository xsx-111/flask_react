Stop! Lyrics
*Laugh*
It's dat real
Mmm, you're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day
Mmm, you're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day
Mmm, you're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day
Mmm, you're gonna want me back in your arms
You're gonna need me, one day
You better stop and think about what you're doing
You better stop and think about what you're doing
You better stop and think about what you're doing
You better stop and think about what you're doing
Give a little back, my way
Oh ooh oh oh

Mad with a passion
Stack cash and rock fashion
Stack cash and rock fashion
Yeah, you're gonna need me, one day3Embed
