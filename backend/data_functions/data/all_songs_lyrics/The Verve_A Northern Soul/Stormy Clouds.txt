Stormy Clouds Lyrics
I wanted to tell you my story
How my life seemed to change in a matter of days
The heavens break I am walking tall
How come change always seems to bring the rain

Stormy clouds, new horizons

Come and get it, if you want to
So hop on the train Cause it kills the pain
Blues player going to another town
Believe me this boy here is sinking
Just drinking
These streets, these times
They tie me down, I'm through with you
But through it all, I feel no pain
