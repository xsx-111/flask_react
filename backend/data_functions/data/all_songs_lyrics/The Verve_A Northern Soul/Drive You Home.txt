Drive You Home Lyrics
Your face, so pale
Hasn't see the light for days
But on the hill
You had no place to say
"The skies are all mine
And I'm proud to be here
But when my lover cries, I feel his tears"

I was gonna drive you home
I was going to tell you who I wanted

We came back to the same place
We didn't speak, just danced in our minds
Oh lover, I know this ain't what it should be
But let me take you home
I'll show you what you should see

I was gonna drive you home
I was going to tell you who I wanted
I was gonna take you home
I was going to tell you who I wanted

When love doesn't give it, love, nothing will
I'll never change for anyone
I know it's there but I, I can't see it
I know it's there but I, I can't see it
A little light with you and me in it
I know it's there but I, I can't see it
I know it's there but I, I can't see it
I know it's there but I, I can't see it
I know it's there but I, I can't see it
I know it's there but I, I can't see it

I was thinking about the times I could have had
And whether they turned out good, if they turn out bad
I was gonna take you home
Show you things your lover wouldn't know

My angel, my lover, my angel
My mind lover, my mind lover
My mind lover, my mind lover
She's my mind loverEmbed
