No Knock on My Door Lyrics
She knew my feelings were jangled and frayed
She took me into a wind blown alley way
She showed me a world a boy should see
I'll thank her 'till the day that I die

So, here we go
No knock on my door
Believe it 'till you see
What living has done to me
And I'm sure that I need holding

I took her to a room and I showed her myself
She made me feel proud that I would stand for
There's nothing that this girl wouldn't do for me
For that I've got to thank her and I mean it

So, here we go
A face in the crowd
Jump up and jump down
Baby, can you see through me?

Sure, I've been here before
No knock on my door
No love in the
Baby, please be my

Cry, I cry every night
I need to hold you tight

Oh, can you see me
Knocking down your door?
Sure, there's times I have hoped
There's times I have dreamed
Oh, but it seems that much to me to me, my love
I never seemed to it out, my love

I'm shaking
Yeah, I'm shaking






Could you see me knocking down your door
Sure there's times that I've gone and times I have dreamed
Oh, but it seems that I pushed you in my life
Can't seem to get it out my life
