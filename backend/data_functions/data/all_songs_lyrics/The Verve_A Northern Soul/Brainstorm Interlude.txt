Brainstorm Interlude LyricsComing in, coming in, coming in, coming in
Coming in, coming in, coming in, coming in
I'm in my home when you give me a sing
And I tell you to put me in to your mind
And if you want to kiss me, don't say goodbye
'Cause I'm on my own to denies
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
