So It Goes Lyrics
Life
Roll my die
Change this life
You said this movie was mine
But now you go and change your mind
This is my life

So it goes
You come in on your own in this life
You know you leave on your own

'Cause I don't need no cause
When my feelings fall
You showed me things I didn't want to see
I don't believe that love is free
Sure fine way to treat a man


Life
This is my life



I'm just a poor little wifeless fella
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella
I'm just a poor little wifeless fella
Another drink and I won't miss her
Another drink and I won't miss her
Another drink and I won't miss her
Another drink and I won't miss herEmbed
