A Northern Soul LyricsThis is a tale of a northern soul
Looking to find his way back home
He's coming from that same old road
You know the one your folks don't know
I want to see if you know me
I was born in a rented room
My mother didn't get no flowers
Dad didn't approve of me, do you?
I'm alive with something inside of me
And I don't think I'm coming back
So come on, come in inside of me
Let's spread it all around
Give me your powder and pills
I want to see if they cure my ills
I've no time for love and devotion
No time for old fashioned potion
I wanna see if you know me
Take a look into my eyes
I tell you so many lies and then I'll
I'll let you go into the night
I'm alive with something inside of me
And I don't think I'm coming down
I'm alive with something inside of me
And I can't seem to get it out
Listen to this
Listen to this
Listen to this
Listen to this
I'm gonna die alone in bed
I'm gonna die alone in bed
I'm gonna die alone in bed
I'm gonna die alone in bed
I'm gonna die alone in bed
I'm gonna die alone in bed
I'm gonna die alone in bed
I'm gonna die alone in bed
This is a tale of a northern soul
Looking for his way back home
And my friend said, "Come in side of me"
And your speakers are telling the truth
Coming through right into your room on a river of sound
This is a tale of a northern soul
Looking for his way back home
And if he sees it I know I'll know
And if he sees it I know I'll know
And there's fighting on the street below
I know there's fighting on the street below
Ah, but I don't care 'cause I'm a northern soul
And I'm looking for a way back home
And I'm looking for a way back home
Too busy staying alive
Too busy staying alive
Too busy staying alive (it keeps turning, everybody's learning, keeping track of a heart attack)
Too busy staying alive (it keeps turning, everybody's burning, keeping track of a heart attack)
Too busy staying alive (it keeps turning, everybody's learning, keeping track of a heart attack)
Too busy staying alive (it keeps turning, everybody's burning, keeping track of a heart attack)
Too busy living a lie (it keeps turning, everybody's learning, keeping track, I'm not coming back)
Too busy living my life (it keeps turning, everybody's learning, keeping track, now I'm coming back)
Too busy staying alive (it keeps turning, everybody's learning, keeping track, now I'm coming back)
Too busy staying alive (it keeps turning, everybody's learning, keeping track, now I'm coming back)
(yes I'm coming back, yes I'm coming back)Embed
