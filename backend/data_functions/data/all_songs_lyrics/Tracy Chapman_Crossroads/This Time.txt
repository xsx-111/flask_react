This Time Lyrics
This time
I won't show I'm vulnerable
This time
I won't give in first
This time
I will hold out with my love
This time
I will not be hurt

I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
I'm gonna treat me right
I'm gonna make you say
That you love me first
And you'll be the one
With the most to lose tonight
This time

This time
Won't let my emotion rule my life
This time
Gonna keep my heart locked safe inside
This time
I'm gonna be my longest friend
This time
I'm gonna be the one
I'm gonna love myself
More than anyone else
I'm gonna treat me right
I'm gonna make you say
That you love me first
And you'll be the one
With the most to lose tonight
This time

This time
Won't let my emotion rule my life
This time
Gonna keep my heart locked safe inside
This time
I'm gonna be my longest friend
This time
I'm gonna be the oneEmbed
