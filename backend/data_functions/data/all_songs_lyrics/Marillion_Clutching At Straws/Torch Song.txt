Torch Song Lyrics
Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks
To burn a little brighter now
Something about Roman candles fizzing out
Shine a little light on me now
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation
Alcohol can thrill me now
It's getting late in the game to show any pride or shame
I just burn a little brighter now

Burn a little brighter now, yeah

Doctor says my liver looks like leaving with my lover
Need another 'time out' now
Like any sort of hero turning down to zero
Still standing out in any crowd
Pulling seventeen with experience and dreams
Sweating out a happy hour
When you're hiding 29 you know it ain't a crime
To burn a little brighter now

Burn a little brighter now
Burn a little brighter now
Burn a little brighter now
Dr. Finlay: "And my advice is if you maintain this lifestyle, you won't reach 30"
Torch: "Christ. It's sort of a romantic way to go really, it's part of the heritage. It's your round i'n'it?

We burn a little brighter now, yeah

Read some Kerouac and it put me on the tracks
To burn a little brighter now
It was something about Roman candles fizzing out
Shine a little light on me now
Found a strange fascination with a liquid fixation
Alcohol thrill me now
Getting late in the game to show any pride or shame
Burn a little brighter now

We burn a little brighter now, yeah
Burn a little brighter now
We burn a little brighter nowEmbed
