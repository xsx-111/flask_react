Excellent Birds Lyrics
Flying birds. Excellent birds
Watch them fly. There they go
Falling snow. Excellent snow
Here it comes. Watch it fall
Long words. Excellent words
I can hear them now
This is the picture

I'm sitting by the window
Watching the snow fall
I'm looking out
And I'm moving, turning in time
Jump up!
And I can land on my feet
Look out!
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture

Looking out
I'm watching out
When I see the future I close my eyes
I can see it now
I see pictures of people
Rising up
I see pictures of people
Falling down
I see pictures of people
They're standing on their heads
They're ready!

They're looking out
Look out!
They're watching out
Watch out!
They're looking out
Look out!
They're watching out
Watching watching out

I see pictures of people
They're watching
I see pictures of people
They're watching out
Watch out
I see pictures of people
They're watching out
They're watching out
I see pictures of people
Watching
Watch out
They're watching
I see pictures of people
Watching out. Watch outEmbed
