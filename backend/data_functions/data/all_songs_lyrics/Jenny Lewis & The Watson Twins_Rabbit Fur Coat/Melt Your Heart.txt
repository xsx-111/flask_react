Melt Your Heart LyricsNothing is ever as good as it was
And what's good for your soul will be bad on your nerves if you reverse it
It's bound to melt your heart
One way or another
It's bound to melt your heart
For good or for bad
It's like a valentine from your mother
It's bound to melt your heart
And we've lost the people we could've loved, and you
What you know you have, or what you think you want, it's never perfect
It's bound to melt your heart
One way or another
It's bound to melt your heart
For good or for bad
It's like a valentine from your mother
It's bound to melt your heart
Are we killing time?
Are we killing each other?
When you're kissing someone who's too much like you
It's like kissing on the mirror
When you're sleeping with someone who doesn't get you
You're going to hate yourself in the morning
It's bound to melt your heart
One way or another
It's bound to melt your heart
For good or for bad
It's like a valentine from your mother
It's bound to melt your heartEmbed
