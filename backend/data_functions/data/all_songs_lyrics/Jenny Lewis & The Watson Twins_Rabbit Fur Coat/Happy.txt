Happy LyricsI'd rather be lonely
I'd rather be free
I'm as sure as the moon rolls around the sea
But I like watching you undress
And I think we're at our best
By the flicker by the light of the TV Set
Cause I can't remember why I hated you
Can't remember why I still do
But I'm a sure as the moon rolls around you
That I could be happy
Happy
Oh so happy
Happy
Oh so happy so happy
They warn you about killers and thieves and knives
I worry about cancer and living right
But my momma never warned me about my own destructive appetite
Or the pitfalls of control
How it locks you in your grave
Looking for someone to be saved under my restraint
So I could be happy
Happy
Oh so happy
Happy
So happy
Happy
So happy so happy
I'm as sure
As the moon
Rolls aroundEmbed
