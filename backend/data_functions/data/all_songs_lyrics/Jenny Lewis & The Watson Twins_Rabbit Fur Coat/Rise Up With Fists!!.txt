Rise Up With Fists!! LyricsWhat are you changing?
Who do you think you're changing?
You can't change things
We're all stuck in our ways
It's like trying to clean the ocean
What do you think, you can drain it?
Well, it was poison and dry
Long before you came
But you can wake up younger under the knife
And you can wake up sounder if you get analyzed
And I'd better wake up
There but for the grace of god go I
It's hard to believe your prophets
When they're asking you to change things
But with their suspect lives, we look the other way
Are you really that pure, sir?
Thought I saw you in Vegas
It was not pretty, but she was
(Not your wife)
But she will wake up wealthy
And you will wake up forty-five
And she will wake up with baby
There but for the grace of god go I
What am I fighting for?
The cops are at my front door
I can't escape that way
The windows are in flames
And what's that on your ankle?
You say they're not coming for you
But house arrest is really just the same
(Just the same)
Like when you wake up behind the bar
Trying to remember where you are
Having crushed all the pretty things
There but for the grace of god go I
But I still believe
And I will rise up with fists
And I will take what's mine
(Mine, mine, mine)
There but for the grace of god go I
There but for the grace of god go I
There but for the grace of god go I
There but for the grace of god go IEmbed
