The Big Guns LyricsWell you praise him
Then you thank him
Till you reach the by-and-by
And I've won hundreds at the track
But I'm not betting on the afterlife
Then you kiss his lips
He forgives you for it
He forgives you for all you've done
But not me
I'm still angry
What have I done?
Why am I always missing
The big guns?
First I'll build a sword
Get some words to explain
It's a plan, brother, at least
And I'll pretend that everybody here wants peace
Have mercy, have mercy
Have mercy on me
Cause we're tired and lonely
And we're bloody
What have we done?
Why are we still running from our own failing bodies?
The big guns
Sing mercy, sing mercy
Sing mercy on me
Let's pretend that everybody here wants peace
What have we done?
Why are we still chasing our own tails?
The big gunsEmbed
