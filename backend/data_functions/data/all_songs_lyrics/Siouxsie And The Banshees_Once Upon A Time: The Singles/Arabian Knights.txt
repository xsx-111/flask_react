Arabian Knights Lyrics
The jewel, the prize
Looking into your eyes
Cool pools drown your mind
What else will you find

I heard a rumour
It was just a rumour
I heard a rumour
What have you done to her?

Myriad lights
They said I'd be impressed
Arabian Knights
At your primitive best

A tourist oasis
Reflects in seedy sunshades
A monstrous oil tanker
Its wound bleeding in seas

I heard a rumour
What have you done to her?
I heard a rumour
What have you done to her?
Veiled behind screens
Kept as your baby machine
Whilst you conquer more orifices
Of boys, goats and things
Ripped out sheep's eyes
No forks or knives

Myriad lights
They said I'd be impressed
Arabian Knights
At your primitive best

I heard a rumour
What have you done to her?
I heard a rumour
What have you done to her?
I heard a rumour2Embed
