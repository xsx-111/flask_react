Love in a Void Lyrics
Too many fools blocking my mo-mo-motion, na-na
Clouding my eyes must be the po-po-potion, na-na
Spots on my eyes must be the lo-lo-lotion, na-na
Spots on my eyes must be the lo-lo-lotion, na-na

Love in a void, it's so numb
Avoid in love, it's so dumb
Love in a void

Too many bigots for my li-li-liking, na-na-na
Too many critics, too few writing, na-na-na
Rabid dogs that aren't bi-bi-biting, na-na-na na na-na-na
Rabid dogs that aren't bi-bi-biting, na-na-na

Love in a void, it's so numb
Avoid in love, it's so dumb
Love in a void
Jaded reputation on which you're staking, na-na-na
Lots of money for the making, na-na-na
For all the stars they're just fa-fa-faking, na-na-na
For all the stars they're just a-fa-fa-faking, na-na-na
Love in a void, it's so numb
Avoid in love, it's so dumb
Love in a void

Uhh
Love in, love in, love in a void
Avoid in love, it's so numb, it's so dumb
Uhh
Love in, love in, love in a void
Avoid in love, it's so numb, it's so dumb
Love in a void it's so dumb
(Barks)
Love in a void, avoid in love it's so dumb
It's so dumb
Love in a void it's so dumbEmbed
