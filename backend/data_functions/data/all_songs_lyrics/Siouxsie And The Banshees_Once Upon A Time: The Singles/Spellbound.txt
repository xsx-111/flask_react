Spellbound Lyrics
From the cradle bars comes a beckoning voice
It sends you spinning, you have no choice
You hear a laughter cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning, you have no choice
You hear a laughter cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning, you have no choice

Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance we are entranced
Spellbound
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance we are entranced
Spellbound
Spellbound, spellbound, ooh-ooh
Spellbound, spellbound, spellbound, spellbound

And don't forget when your elders forget to say their prayers
Take them by the legs and throw them down the stairs
When you think your toys have gone berserk
It's an illusion you cannot shirk
You hear laughter cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning you have no choice

Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance we are entranced
Spellbound
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance we are entranced
Spellbound
Spellbound, spellbound, ooh-ooh
Spellbound, spellbound, spellbound, spellbound
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Entranced, entranced
Entranced, entranced
Entranced, entranced13Embed
