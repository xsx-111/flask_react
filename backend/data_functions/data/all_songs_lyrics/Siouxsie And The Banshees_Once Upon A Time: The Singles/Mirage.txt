Mirage Lyrics
I'm just a vision on your TV screen
Just something conjured from a dream
Seen through your x-ray eyes, a see-through scene
The image is no images, it's not what it seems

My limbs are like palm trees swaying in no breeze
My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
Your non excuse for human being

It's not plain to see that I'm playing with me
A photo-fit of loose ends, framed in 3-D
Seen through your x-ray eyes, a see-through scene
The image is no images, it's not what it seems

My limbs are like palm trees swaying in no breeze
My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
Your non excuse for human being, being, being

My limbs are like palm trees swaying in no breeze
My body's an oasis to drink from as you please
I'm not seeing what I'm meant to believe in
Your non excuse for human being
It's not what it seems, the image is no images
It's not what it seems, it's not what it seemsEmbed
