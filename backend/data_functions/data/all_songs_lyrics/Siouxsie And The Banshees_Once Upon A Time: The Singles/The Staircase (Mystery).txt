The Staircase (Mystery) LyricsStaircase lying face up
Stare cat sat on a mat looking down
Looking down
Slide down the banister
Take the escalator
Slide down the banister
Or try the elevator
I was standing on the landing
Now I'm standing in the hall
Looking up
Won't someone assist me
Solve this mystery
Somebody assist me
Arrange the symmetry
Muffled footsteps on the carpet
Spiral steps start spinning
Around me
Which floor, which ceiling
You're off balance
Which floor, which ceiling
It's all upside down
Staircase lying face up
Stare cat sat on a mat looking down
Looking down
