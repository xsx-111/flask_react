Pay Your Rates LyricsPay your rates
Pay your water rates
Pay your rates
Pay your water rates
If your rate's too high
Write a snotty letter
If your rate's too high
Put your life on this bit of paper
Advice on rates
Advice on rates
Pay your rates
Pay your water rates
Pay your rates
Pay your water rates
If your rate's too high
Write a snotty letter
If you don't pay your rates
You're gonna end up here
Or end up on debtors' retreat estate
Or debtors' retreat escape
Debtors' escape estate
Debtors' escape
Debtors' retreat escape
Debtors' retreat estate
Neurotic red landscape
A socialist state invention
Them old government bones working
(Legendary Chaos tape:
Let's hear it for the working class traitors
Hello Warren Mitchell)
Debtors' escape estate
Debtors' retreat estate
A no-motivation estate
Debtors' escape estate
Pay the borough
Pay the borough
Pay your rates
Pay the borough
Pay the borough
Pay the borough
Pay your rates
Pay your water rates
Pay your rates
 worried about
Pay the borough
Pay the borough
Pay your rates
