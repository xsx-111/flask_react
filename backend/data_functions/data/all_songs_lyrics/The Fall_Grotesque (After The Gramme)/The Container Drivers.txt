The Container Drivers LyricsNet cap. of 58 thousand pounds
They sweat on their way down
Grey port with customs bastards
Hang around like clowns the uh
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Bad indigestion
Bad bowel retention
Speed for their wages
Suntan, torn short sleeves
Suntan, torn short sleeves
The uh containers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Look at a car park for two days
Look at a grey port for two days
Train line, stone and grey
Train line, stone and grey uh
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Okay one!
This is not their town
Big cigars come out of the ground
Sweat on their way down
Sweat on their way down
Uh containers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers
F. Jack's a distant relation
Communists are just part time workers
And there's no thanks
From the loading bay ranks
For the uh uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers
The uh containers and their drivers
Uh containers and their drivers
Look at a car park for two days
Look at a grey port for two days
Train line, stone and grey
RO-RO roll on roll off
Uh uh containers and their drivers
Speed for their wages
The container drivers
Uh containers!
And their drivers!1Embed
