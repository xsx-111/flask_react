W.M.C. - Blob 59 LyricsRight we'll go here
Where is he?
Just been to the park
Not the pub, the park
Go on
We too do not recognise the M.U
We come with our hands open in fiendship
We can lead you to proletarian visions of posterity
WMC!
(The social alternative was incredibly frequent)
(completely unidentifiable backing singing continues....)
We come with our hands open in fiendship
We can lead you to proletarian visions of posterity
We merely make cabaret
We are on Gramme FridayEmbed
