Gramme Friday LyricsThe people I like live
In kitchens and halls
I can't reach a decision on this
Can I come back to you on this?
Hitler lost his nerve on it
Dr. Morell prescribed it well
It's fast debts
I am Robertson Speedo
And this is my Gramme Friday
Skin drops slow to the bones
But I've got my hunger anyway
I'm on Gramme Friday
Work and eat spontaneous
Enter the house of weariness
It's Fastnet
Look out
Look down
Look out
Look now
The hunger....
