A Better Sun LyricsThis is the part where I remember
All of the things I should forget
This is the part where I embrace all of the good
And the bad thoughts existing in my head
This is the part where I am proper
This is the part where I'm just another face
This is the part where I'm a marathon runner
And both my ankles are sprained
And it's hard
So hard
And breathing it just makes it worse
And it's bad
So bad
That it hurts
This is the part where I'm in heaven
This is the part where I ascend
This is the part where I did cocaine
To impress every one of my mouth breathing friends
This is the part where I am empty
This is the part where it hurts
This is the part where I explode and destroy
Everything on this god given earth
This is the part where I am ugly
This is the part where it ends5Embed
