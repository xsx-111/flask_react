Where Are You? Lyrics"Is everything okay?"
"Not right now, but it will be
I'm just stuck in the same old place again"
"Do you need anything?"
"Well, considering I'm still standing
I'd say I've done pretty well for myself
And I've seen both sides of the field
And I've lost more blood than one should yield
But I'm still here and my old wounds have healed"
I've got friends who've died
But everything's going to be alright
They'll be with me by my side every night
And they're with me every time
That I bite off more than I can chew
So tell me, where are you?
"Is there anything I can do?"
"Tell you what - there is, and it starts off with you
Don't tell me how to live my life; I'm going to be fine"
"Cameron, how can I help?"
"Well, you can meet me in hell and take care of yourself
It gets pretty hot where I live
And it gets pretty cold when at twenty-three years old
You've been running from death your whole life"
I've got friends who've died
But everything's going to be alright
They'll be with me by my side every night
And they're with me every time
That I bite off more than I can chew
So tell me, where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
I've got friends who've died
But everything's going to be alright
They'll be with me by my side every night
And they're with me every time
That I bite off more than I can chew
So tell me, where are you?3Embed
