First Letter from St. Sean LyricsWhen your teeth turn gray and stain your tongue
When you bite so hard on your lip blood fills your mouth
You can't swallow it cause you can't swallow guilt
When your best friend dies and your next friend dies
And your best friend's friend takes his life
And you spend six months on your own
'Cause there's no one left to talk to
I'm scraping off the back of my hand
To sit and talk and say to his friends
I am not alive, I didn't mean to leave you when I died
I was too scared you might be the one to leave
There's so much more to life than the flick of a knife
I am alive 'cause I'm alive inside of this2Embed
