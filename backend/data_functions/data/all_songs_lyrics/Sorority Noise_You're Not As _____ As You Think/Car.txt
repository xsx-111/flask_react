Car LyricsEighteen minutes ago you called me on my phone
You said, "I'm sorry, why do I feel so alone?"
I said, "I'm sorry, is there anything that I can do?"
You said, "Care about me like you used to."
I'm sleeping in a van most nights
It's not ideal but I've never felt more alive
In fact, I've never felt quite exactly the way that I am
My friends are dying quicker than I possibly can
Nineteen minutes ago you called me on my phone
I've been keeping tabs on when I call you on the phone
So I call you every day but I guess if every day
Means some days then I call you every day
Beware that I'm not who I used to be
I've had a lot of things go wrong with me
And I'm sorry I'm not capable of lying
My parents, they are looking for my house
To find that Granite St.'s no longer where I live
Or send the mail to or the things that I don't want to receive
My parents love me or at least now I'm alive to see
Twenty minutes ago you called me on my phone
You said, "Cameron, why do I feel so alone?"
I said, "I'm sorry, is there anything that I can do?"
You said, "Care about me like you used to."
Not too long ago you called me on my phone
And I held back tears 'cause I was feeling so alone
I have to be stronger or at least much stronger than I've been
Like a father or the son, holy spirit, amen5Embed
