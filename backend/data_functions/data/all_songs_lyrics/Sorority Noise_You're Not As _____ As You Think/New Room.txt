New Room LyricsI haven't been spending enough time alone
Maybe that's why I feel like I don't have a home
I want to be all the things that you want me to be
But I can't, no I won't be the thing that helps you become
All that you want to, all that you need to be
And I, I will wait until you aren't great anymore
It's not fair anymore1Embed
