Disappeared LyricsI took some time to myself
To sort out all the things
That make me feel the way that I feel
Just this year I lost a basketball team to heaven
And I’m sure they’re shooting jumpers
With Jesus, Mary, and Joseph
And you said we wouldn’t notice it
If you had disappeared
But I swore I got a phone call
So that seemed pretty weird
So caught up in my own head
I took a walk down my street
Thought I’d find something to eat
But I headed back immediately
'Cause I’m pretty scared of guns
So go out and have some fun, let loose
And I’ll daydream of the noose that took my friend Sean’s life
And he thought we wouldn’t notice it
If he had disappeared
But I swore I got a phone call
So that seemed pretty weird
So caught up in my own head
I let my hair down today
And I took a shower for the first time in what felt like weeks
I felt my hair falling out
And I felt myself falling down
But that can’t seem to be the reason
I can’t sleep when I’m alone
It's getting better
And it’s hardly getting worse
It's hard to think about the things that make it all hurt
I found myself on the street
You swore that you would love me
And I swore I’d love you too
And you’ll barely even notice it when I disappear5Embed
