Leave the Fan On LyricsTell me what it's like to have emotion
Show me what it's like to be enough
Teach you what it's like to be a headache
Who feels none of the above
Welcome to my hell I've got a notebook
Empty page and a messed up head
Tell me what it's like to know you're something
Even when you feel better off dead
I let my stomach become a cancer
Leave the fan on when you leave
Show me what it's like to taste your own blood
And I'll tell you what it's like to be serene
Show you what it's like to be impatient
Show you what it's like to raise your voice
Remember what it's like to feel the vacancy
When your chest it's in my chest it's in my chest
Welcome to my hell I've got a mattress
Some blankets so you can rest your head
And neighbours they don't mind all the noises
They just put a new mailbox up again
I let my teeth become an off-white
I leave the fan on when I leave
Show me what it's like to taste your own blood
And I'll tell you what it's like to be serene1Embed
