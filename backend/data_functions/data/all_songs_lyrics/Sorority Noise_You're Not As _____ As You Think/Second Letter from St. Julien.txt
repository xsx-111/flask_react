Second Letter from St. Julien LyricsYou say there's a god
And you say you've got proof
Well I've lost friends to heroin
So what's your god trying to prove?
You say he's alive
His spirit flows through your veins
Well I guess my best friend
Was just trying to help the spirit escape
And if there's a god
Do I make him proud?
Put a smile on his face?
My mother, she gave me a crucifix
She said, "Pray to Anthony if you lose this."
Well, how can I believe in god if he won't believe in me?
I let my anxieties overwhelm me
Tell me, why am I blessed with this curse?
That rips holes through my head
And put holes in my chest
I get the feeling "maybe Iâ€™d be better dead"
I wanna get over the feeling that I'll never be good enough
And if there's a god
Do I make him proud?
Put a smile on her face?
And if you're with god
Am I making you proud
By waking up each day?
And if you're with God
Well, I hope that you're proud
With a smile on your face
And if you're with god
Well, I hope that you're proud
With a smile on your face3Embed
