Fly Away LyricsI've told myself, so many times
Not to turn into the type, but I've found
Is it too late, has my time come?
Sometimes I think I'm losing it
Am I the only one?
Understandin', more like demanding
Where do the grey skies end?
So should I stay or fly away?
The wings that I begin to grow
Will surely let me know
How far I have to go
And I'll be there
Oh yet again, thought I was right
But as usual I end up on the wrong side of the fence
Is it too late, has my time come?
Sometimes I think I'm losin' it
Am I the only one?
Understandin', more like demanding
Where do the grey skies end?
So should I stay or fly away?
The wings that I begin to grow
Will surely let me know
How far I have to go
And I'll be there
Ohhhh, yeah!

Understandin', more like demanding
Where do the grey skies end?
So should I stay or fly away?
The wings that I begin to grow
Will surely let me know
How far I have to go
And I'll be there
Will surely let me know
How far I have to go
And I'll be thereEmbed
