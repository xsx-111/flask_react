Prisoner of Society Lyrics
Well, we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes, we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you to tell us what to do
We don't refer to the past when we're showing what we've done
Our generation gap means the war is never won
The past is in your head, the future's in our hands

'Cause I'm a brat
And I know everything and I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening to anything you say
And if you count to three (One, two, three)
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society

Well, we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes, we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you to tell us what to do

'Cause I'm a brat
And I know everything and I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening to anything you say
And if you count to three (One, two, three)
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society
Go!

Well, we don't need no one to tell us what to do
Oh yes, we're on our own and there's nothing you can do
So we don't need no one like you to tell us what to do
We don't refer to the past when we're showing what we've done
Our generation gap means the war is never won
So we don't need no one like you to tell us what to do

'Cause I'm a brat
And I know everything and I talk back
'Cause I'm not listening to anything you say
And if you count to three
You'll see there's no emergency
You'll see I'm not the enemy
Just a prisoner of society, society, society, society
Society, society, society, society2Embed
