Growing Up (Falling Down) LyricsI'm lying on my head, no I'm not in my bed, just
Checkin out the world from a different angle
That's what happens when you trip on your blindness
Always seems for some reason that it's happening to me
Why is it so, and why don't I know?
Why is it so, I can't see the obstacle in front of me
The obstacle in front of me
Christ I'm falling down again
It happens tome now and then
I'm growing up yeah, growing up yeah
I won't let it fade away, I promise to be strong and brave
I'm growing up yeah, growing up yeah
Growing up yeah
Growing up yeah
Growing up yeah
Open up your eyes and maybe then you'll realise
The truth is in your thoughts you hold
And not the obstacle in front of you
Why is it so, and why don't I know?
Why is it so, I can't see the obstacle in front of me
The obstacle in front of me
Christ I'm falling down again
It happens to me now and then
I'm growing up yeah, growing up yeah
I won't let it fade away, I promise to be strong and brave
I'm growing up yeah, growing up yeah
Growing up yeah
Growing up yeah
Growing up yeah
Growing up yeah
Growing up yea
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
I'm lying on my head, no I'm not in my bed, just
Checkin out the world from a different angle
That's what happens when you trip on your blindness
Always seems for some reason that it's happening to me
Why is it so, and why don't I know?
Why is it so, I can't see the obstacle in front of me
The obstacle in front of me
Christ I'm falling down again
It happens to me now and then
I'm growing up yeah, growing up yeah
I won't let it fade away, I promise to be strong and brave
I'm growing up yeah, growing up yeah
Growing up yeah
