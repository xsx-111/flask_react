Save The Day Lyrics
So here I come to save the day
A regular Joe now on parade
(They say) it's the only way (but they)
They only want it when it's there

So here I come to save the day
The future's here and the past is yesterday
(They say) it's the only way (they say)
They only want it when it's there
When it's there

We're not going on a holiday
We do a lot of work but we don't get paid
Stand up don't walk away
Take your pride and swallow, swallow
Take your pride and swallow, swallow

Life's full of much unwanted waste
Crime pays and the junkies walk away
(But for) husband and the good son (they speak)
Ill at ease but they dare not run
They dare not run
We're not going on a holiday
We do a lot of work but we don't get paid
Stand up don't walk away
Take your pride and swallow, swallow
Take your pride and swallow, swallow


We're not going on a holiday
We do a lot of work but we don't get paid
Stand up don't walk away
Take your pride and swallow, swallow (we're not going on a holiday)
Take your pride and swallow, swallow (we're not gonna walk away)
Take your pride and swallow, swallow (we're not going on a holiday)
Take your pride and swallow, swallow (we're not gonna walk away)
Take your pride and dieEmbed
