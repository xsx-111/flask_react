Monday LyricsMonday, a day like no other
Monday, was their last day
Some say, life is a struggle
Some say, life should be easy
One day, in a peaceful village school day, in working DUNBLANE
ONE man, could change their whole world, one man, is all it took for...
No school today, it's just a memory, ONE MIND GONE WRONG???
I don't wanna play on Monday
I don't wanna play on Monday
Pinned to my memory, not just another Monday, it seems like such a lie
Change of plans on a rainy day a new lesson to be learnt today
Pack up your guns and your soldiers too because one sick mind depends on YOU...
Playin' quietly, along came destiny, I don't wanna play...Embed
