Second Solution LyricsStandin' on a streetlight tryin' to get away
Guilty guilty I hear what you say
Countin' down the hours but I haven't got the time
The 23rd precinct jumpin' on the line on the line
And what I wanna know
Is will I get death row
Or is there a second solution
What I wanna say
Is will I die today
Or will I get...second solution
It was never meant to end this way
One shot violence I hear what you say
Standin' on the streetlight tryin' to get away
Guilty Guilty I hear what I say what I say
And what I wanna know
Is will I get death row
Or is there a second solution
What I wanna say
Is will I die today
Or will I get...second solution
Standin' on a streetlight tryin' to get away (hey)
Guilty guilty I hear what you say
Countin' down the hours but i haven't got the time
The 23rd precinct jumpin' on the line on the line
And what I wanna know
Is will I get death row
Or is there a second solution
What I wanna say
Is will I die today
Or will I get...
Second solution second solution
Second solution second solution
Second solution second solution
Second solution second solution
Second solution second solution
