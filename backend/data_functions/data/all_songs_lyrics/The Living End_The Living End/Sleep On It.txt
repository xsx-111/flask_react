Sleep On It LyricsThe afternoon just slips away
'Cause it's the end of another day
And as the sky turns from blue to black
Time again for the image is back
So I don't know what's right
Screaming at you in the middle of the night
Can you help me please, Can you HELP??!!
Don't you sleep on it
The walls are closing in
This time you feel it you'll know it's not right
Now I know!
Far away from reality
Is a lock that holds no key
The strangest dream I ever had
Wake up call never seemed so bad
Don't know what's come over me
Some say that it's destinyEmbed
