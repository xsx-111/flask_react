Have They Forgotten LyricsOne soul, One life, One meaning
As far as we know
So why the hell should we be grieving?
I don't know
A house without no hope
They say there's nothing we can do
Just stand back
But while the government comforts you
Says "Let's be patient"
One more cell becomes vacant
Have they forgotten what it's all about?
Sometimes I wonder, can't work it out
An equation with no answer
Have they forgotten what it's all about?
Too many times we don't react
Too many things oh that's just crap
And if you cannot see, the effect it has on me -You're blindEmbed
