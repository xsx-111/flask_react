Bloody Mary LyricsWell there's no time to stop her now
Mary's gonna get her way somehow
Still just a game but I ask her and remind
Still just a game but I ask her and remind that Maryï¿½
23 seconds on the floor
Is all she needs and not a minute more
Still just a game but I ask her and remind
Still just a game but I ask her and remind that Maryï¿½
You'll die tonight!Embed
