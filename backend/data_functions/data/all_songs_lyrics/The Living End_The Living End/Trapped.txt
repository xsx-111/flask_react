Trapped LyricsHere it comes again, don't let it pass you by like the city bound train
You know it's up to us, to lead the way and march toward victory
Standin' on the right side, who knows what's right?
Don't look now, seems like we're TRAPPED somehow
I'm not sure if we'll ever make it out of here alive
Don't look now, seems like we're TRAPPED somehow
Time is almost up, but the war has just begun
We're stuck inside a place, and soon we'll have to face the outside world...
The anger on the street begins to raise some heat, and we're almost out of timeEmbed
