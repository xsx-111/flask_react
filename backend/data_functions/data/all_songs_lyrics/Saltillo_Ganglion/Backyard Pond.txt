Backyard Pond Lyrics
Whatever, yeah, music, music without the barriers
Enough people know about you
Enough people know about you




I wanna beat your fucking ass

That oughta teach you a lesson


It's safe children
It's safe children
It's safe children
What does it all mean?
That oughta teach you a lesson
That oughta teach you a lesson
That oughta teach you a lesson
That oughta teach you a lesson
That oughta teach you a lesson
That oughta teach you a lesson

Do you suppose this is all there is to the world?

Enough people know about you

I wanna beat your fucking ass
I wanna beat your fucking ass

He lived aloneEmbed
