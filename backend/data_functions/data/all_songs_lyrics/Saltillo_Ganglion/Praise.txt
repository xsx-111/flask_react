Praise Lyrics
I'm so glad
I'm so glad, glad, glad
I'm so glad
I'm so glad, glad, glad
I'm so glad
I'm so glad
I'm so glad
I'm so glad

Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore
Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Can't stand thinking
Leave me alone
Leave me
Leave
Leave me alone, I can't
Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore
Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore
Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore

I'm so glad
I'm so glad


Leave me alone
Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore
Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore
Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore
Leave me alone, I can't stand thinking anymore
