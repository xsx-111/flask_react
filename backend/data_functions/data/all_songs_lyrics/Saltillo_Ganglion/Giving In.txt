Giving In Lyrics
For all the joys thy child shall bring
The risk of grief we'll run
To all parents:

You're born, raised and then torn down
To look a little more like everyone you meet
And everyday that goes by
You look a little less like who you used to be

I don't mind the people staring
Cause I know they never see me anyway
In these days, all the worlds the stage
And everyone one just wants to be the star

we'll love him while we may

This is all too heavy
If you believe in your self
But no one can hurt you
Without your consent
And I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in
And I'm not giving in
I don't mind the people staring
Cause I know they never see me anyway
And everyday that goes by
You look a little less like who you used to be

I don't mind the people staring
Cause I know they never see me anyway
In these days, all the worlds the stage
And everyone one just wants to be the star

This is all too heavy
If you believe in your self
But no one can hurt you
Without your consent
And I am not giving in

This is all too heavy
If you believe in your self
But no one can hurt you
Without your consent
And I am not giving in
I'm not giving in
And I'm not giving in
I'll lend you, for a little time, a child of mine
For you to love the while she lives
And mourn for when she's dead
And from the throngs that crowd
Life's lanes, I have selected you
Now will you give her all your love
Nor think the labor vain
Nor hate me when I come to call to
Take her back again?Embed
