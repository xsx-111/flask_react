Blood and Milk Lyrics
True I'm nervous. But why do you think I'm mad?
First I dismembered...

Dangerous world
Dangerous world
Dangerous
World
Dangerous, dangerous world
Dangerous, dangerous world
Dangerous, a world


Listen how calmly I can tell you the whole story
First I dismembered

Dangerous, dangerous world
Dangerous, world
World
Dangerous World
True I'm nervous. But why do you think I'm mad?
My senses are very sharp, my hearings extremely acute...
Does that make me mad?





Listen how calmly I can tell you the whole storyEmbed
