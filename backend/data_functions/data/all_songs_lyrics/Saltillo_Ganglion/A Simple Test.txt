A Simple Test Lyrics
These are the sounds of days that are passed
We record a new dimension of history
A scrapbook of sounds from violence and achievement

Just shut up!

I have your picture

It's a simple test to establish the proper balance of your loud speaker

Never change
I have your picture

In order to derive maximum enjoyment

I have your picture, staring at your face
Subtle , the seasons never change
I have your picture, staring at your face
Subtle in the windows, the seasons never change
I...think it was inspired by the devil...

Now

Devil
Devil

Now isn't that something?

I...think it was inspired by the devil...

Such a lovely melody is playing through my head
Let me play it for you

I have your picture, staring at your face
Subtle in the windows, the seasons never change
I have the letters you tried to send me
Subtle innuendos; I never opened them
I used to think if I died in an evil place
Then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to heaven
But now, fuck...

Devil

Now

Devil
Devil

Now isn't that something?

Devil

Now

Devil
Devil
Now isn't that something?

Devil

And I'll kill anyone who dares  me

I have your picture, staring at your face
Subtle in the windows, the seasons never change
I have the letters you tried to send me
Subtle innuendos; I never opened them

A simple test to establish the proper balance of your loud speakerEmbed
