Your House Lyrics
When you're on, I swear you're on
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
I think the whole room can hear me clear my throat
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out

If you still care at all, don't go, tell me now
If you love me at all, don't call

Then out of nowhere, put me right back there
Rip my heart out, you rip my heart right out
And we know what happens when we get to your house
You'll rip my heart out, you'll rip my heart right out

If you still care at all, don't go, tell me now
If you love me at all, please don't tell me now
If you still care at all, don't go, tell me now
If you love me at all, don't call

Well, I throw away everything I've written you
Oh, anything, just keep my mind off of thinking how I had you once
Oh, I can't forget that
Sometimes, I wish I could lose you again
You're winning me over with everything you say
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out
When I let you closer, I only want you closer
You rip my heart right out
You rip my heart right out

If you still care at all, don't go, tell me now
If you love me at all, please don't tell me now
Yeah, if you still care at all, don't go, tell me now
And if you love me at all, don't call

If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all
If you love me at all2Embed
