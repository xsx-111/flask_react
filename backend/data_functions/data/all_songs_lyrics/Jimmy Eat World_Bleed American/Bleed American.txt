Bleed American Lyrics
I'm not alone 'cause the TV's on, yeah
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day
And rest, clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with Speyside with your grain
Clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with Speyside

Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in and we can get the last call
Our lives, our coal
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up, it's the picket line or the parade
Our lives

I'm not alone 'cause the TV's on, yeah
I'm not crazy 'cause I take the right pills every day
And rest, clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with Speyside with your grain
Clean your conscience, clear your thoughts with Speyside

Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in and we can get the last call
Our lives, our coal
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Ah, our hearts, yeah, littering the topsoil
Sign up, it's the picket line or the parade
Our lives
(I bled the) greed from my arm
Won't they give it a rest now?
(Give it a rest now)
Now, now, now

Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Tune in and we can get the last call
Our lives, our coal
Salt, sweat, sugar on the asphalt
Our hearts littering the topsoil
Sign up, it's the picket line or the parade
Our lives, our coal8Embed
