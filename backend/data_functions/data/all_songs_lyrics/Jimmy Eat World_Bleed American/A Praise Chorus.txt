A Praise Chorus Lyrics
Are you going to live your life wondering
Standing in the back, looking around?
Are you going to waste your time thinking
How you've grown up or how you missed out?
Th-th-th-th-things are never going to be the way you want
Where's it going to get you acting serious?
Th-th-th-th-things are never going to be quite what you want
Even at 25, you got to start sometime

I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight

Are you going to live your life standing in the back looking around?
Are you going to waste your time?
Got to make a move or you'll miss out
So-so-so-so-someone's going to ask you what it's all about
Stick around, nostalgia won't let you down
So-so-so-so-someone's going to ask you what it's all about
What you going to have to say for yourself?

I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
Now all I need is just to hear a song I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight
Crimson and clover, over and over
Crimson and clover, over and over
(Crimson)
Our house in the middle of the street
(And clover)
Why did we ever meet?
(Over)
Started my rock 'n roll fantasy
(And over)
(Crimson)
Don't, don't, don't let's start
(And clover)
Why did we ever part?
(Over)
Kick start my rock and rollin' heart
(And over)

I'm on my feet, I'm on the floor, I'm good to go
So come on, Davey, sing me something that I know
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight
(Here tonight)
I want to fall in love tonight
(Here tonight)
I want to always feel like part of this was mine
I want to fall in love tonight
I want to fall in love tonight
I want to fall in love tonight4Embed
