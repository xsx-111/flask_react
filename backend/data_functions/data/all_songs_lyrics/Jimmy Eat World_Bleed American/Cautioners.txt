Cautioners Lyrics
The time I would spend with pictures I would not send
I watched you go from left to right
I followed you all night across my blinds

You'll change your mind come Monday and turn your back on me
You'll take your steps away with hesitance
You'll take your steps away from me

I'm making my peace, I'm making it with distance
Maybe that's a big mistake
You know I'm thinking of you
I miss you

You'll change your mind come Monday and turn your back on me
You'll take your steps away with hesitance
You'll take your steps away from me


You'll change your mind come Monday and turn your back on me
You'll take your steps away with hesitance
You'll take your steps away from me1Embed
