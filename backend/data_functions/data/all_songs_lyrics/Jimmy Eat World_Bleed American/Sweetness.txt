Sweetness Lyrics
If you're listening, whoa
Sing it back, whoa
String from your tether unwinds
(String from your tether unwinds), whoa, whoa oh
Up and outward to bind
(Up and outward to bind), whoa, whoa

I was spinning free, whoa
With a little sweet and simple numbing me

Are you listening? Whoa
Sing it back, whoa
So, tell me what do I need
(Tell me what do I need), whoa, whoa
When words lose their meaning
(When words lose their meaning), whoa, whoa

I was spinning free, whoa
With a little sweet and simple numbing me, yeah
Stumble 'til you crawl, whoa
Sinking into sweet uncertainty
Are you listening? Are you listening?

If you're listening, whoa (If you're listening, are you listening?)
Sing it back, whoa (If you're listening, are you listening?)
And I'm still running away
(I'm still running away) whoa, whoa oh
Won't play your hide and seek game
(Your hide and seek game), whoa, whoa

I was spinning free, whoa
With a little sweet and simple numbing me
What a dizzy dance, whoa
And the sweetness will not be concerned with me

No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me
No, the sweetness will not be concerned with me14Embed
