SOLID STATE SURVIVOR Lyrics
Minds blind, empty eyes
Cracked smiles
Black tongues ablaze
No names, breathe in dreams
Standin' in line
Cracked smiles

The strangeness of the strangers
Second hand teenagers
Face to face they face
A chemical race

Minds blind, empty eyes
Cracked smiles
Black tongues ablaze
No names, breathe in dreams
Standin' in line
Cracked smiles


And Marilyn Monroe's not home
So I sit alone with the video
And Tokyo Rose is on the phone
Dressed to kill
Minds blind, empty eyes
Cracked smiles
Black tongues ablaze
No names, breathe in dreams
Standin' in line
Cracked smiles
