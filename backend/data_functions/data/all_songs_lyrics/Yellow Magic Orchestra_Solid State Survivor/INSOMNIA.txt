INSOMNIA Lyrics

Cannot sleep at all
I'm insomniac
Cannot sleep at all
I'm insomniac
I'm just alive beneath these caffeine eyes
Cannot sleep at all
I'm insomniac
Cannot sleep at all
I'm insomniac

And I'm just alive beneath these caffeine eyes
Damn-looking eternal moon, you never move
The ticking of the clock that never stops (Never stops)

Cannot sleep at all
I'm an insomniac
Cannot sleep at all
I'm insomniac
I'm just alive beneath these caffeine eyes
Cannot sleep at all
I'm insomniac
Cannot sleep at all...1Embed
