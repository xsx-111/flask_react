DAY TRIPPER Lyrics
She was a day tripper yeah, a one way ticket yeah
It took me so so long to find out, and I found out
To find out, I found out

Got a good reason for taking the easy way out
Got a good reason for taking the easy way out now

She was a day tripper yeah, a one way ticket yeah
It took me so so long to find out, and I found out
To find out, I found out


She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there
She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now

She was a day tripper yeah, a one way ticket yeah
It took me so so long to find out, and I found out
To find out, I found out
To find out, I found out
To find out, I found out
To find out, I found out
Day tripper
Day tripper yeah
Day tripper
Day tripper yeah
Day tripperEmbed
