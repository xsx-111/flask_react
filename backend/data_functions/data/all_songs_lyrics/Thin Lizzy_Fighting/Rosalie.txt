Rosalie LyricsShe's quite the mediator
A smoother operator you will never see
She'll see you later
No one dares disobey her openly
She knows music
I know music too, you see
She got the power
The teen queen, Rosalie
Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie
She got the plastic
Come from all the corners, corners of the world
So fantastic
She's everybody's favorite little record girl
She knows music
I know music too, you see
She got the power
I got the power, Rosalie
Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie
Down on me, Rosalie
Shine on me, will you please?
From Chattanooga
To good old Bogalusa
You can hear her fine
She makes the choices
Then you'd best be smiling
When it's choosing time
She knows music
I know music too, you see
She's got the power
She has the tower, Rosalie
Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie, Rosalie
