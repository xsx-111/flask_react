Suicide LyricsThe paper called it suicide
A bullet from a forty five
Nobody cared, nobody cried
Don't that make you feel sad
Peter Brent combed his hair then sent
For the police
Policeman came, took Peter's name
God may he rest in peace
No one saw the note beside the body
No one knew the problem but my God
He was a suicide
The body remains unidentified
Forgotten in a file
Like the letter that was blown aside
Don't that make you want to smile a while
Smile a little while
For the suicide
Yeah, baby
No one was really satisfied
About number eighty one
The autopsy proved that Peter lied
But they could never find the gun
No one saw the note beside the body
Nobody knew the problem but my God
Suicide
The paper called it suicide
A bullet from a forty five
Nobody cared, nobody cried
Don't that make you want to boogieEmbed
