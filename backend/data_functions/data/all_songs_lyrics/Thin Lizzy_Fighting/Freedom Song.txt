Freedom Song LyricsListen while I tell you the hard luck story
About a man named Jack McDuff
He believed in the God and the glory
But he just wasn't tough enough
I believe in the freedom song
Long live liberty
I believe in the freedom song
But I'll choose my own destiny
Well, they took him and they beat him
Underneath that old hanging tree
Saying, Jack, you must die
What will your last words be?
Jack, he hung his head back
Long live liberty
I believe in the freedom song
Doesn't matter what you do to me
With a rope around his neck they left him hanging
High on that old hanging tree
On her knees his wife was screaming
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy
I believe in the freedom song
Long live-a the liberty
I believe in that freedom song
Doesn't matter what you do to meEmbed
