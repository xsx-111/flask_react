Wild One LyricsWild one, won't you please come home?
You've been away so long
We need you home, we need you near
Come back, wild one, will you?
How can we live without your love?
You know that could kill you
How can we carry on when you are gone?
My wild one
So you're a wild one
You are a wild one
Over and over and over and over
So you go your way, wild one
I'll try and follow
And if you change your mind
I will be waiting here for you tomorrow
For I would beg for you
I would steal and I would borrow
I'd do anything at all, anything at all
To end this sorrow
My wild one
You are a wild one
As Johnny goes to ?
Johnny go to ?
There was no hope
Wild one
The gypsies warned of the danger
You can laugh and joke with friends
But don't you ever talk to strangers
Although their offers may be sweet
I'll bet and I would wager
Away you'll stray and never come back
To those who love and made you
As Johnny goes to ?
Hey, you three, you where you'll stray
Over and over and over
What a lonely wild oneEmbed
