Fighting My Way Back LyricsFighting
Fighting
I'm tough, rough, ready and i'm able
To pick myself up from under this table
Don't you stick no sign on me, I got no label
I'm a little sick, unsure, unsound and unstable
But I'm fighting my way back
I'm fighting my way back
Fighting
But I'm busting out and I'm going in
And I'm kicking up about the state I'm in
Looking to my future, not my past
I want to be a good boy but how long can it last
I'm fighting my way back
I'm fighting my way back
Fighting
I'm fighting my way back
I'm fighting my way back
Fighting
This kid is going to wreck and ruin
And he ain't quite sure of he's doing
You see it happened all a little too soon
But it's all here in this here tune
I'm fighting my way back
I'm fighting my way back
I'm fighting my way back
Fighting
I'm fighting my way back
But I'm busting out and I'm going in
And I'm kicking up about the state I'm in
But I'm tough, rough, ready and i'm able
To pick myself up from under this table
I'm fighting my way back
I'm fighting my way back
