For Those Who Love to Live LyricsUp jumped Jack on the railroad track
Saying I've got to get out of town
It's been really nice knowing you
Hope to see you around
The boy, he could boogie
The boy can kick a ball
But the boy, he got hung up
Smooching in the stalls
You've got to give a little bit of love
To those who love to live
Gotta give a little good
You've got to take a little bit of hate
From those who have to wait
Up jumped John putting his trousers on
Saying I've got to get out of here
Hear your lover's footsteps
They're coming too near for me, my dear
The boy, he could boogie
The boy can kick a ball
But the boy, he got hung up
Making love against a wall
You've got to give a little bit of love
To those who love to live
You've got to take a little bit of hate
From those who have to wait
Take that hate
Gotta give a little bit of loveEmbed
