Silver Dollar LyricsI should've known you couldn't take it
You had to make it with another man
You know that's true, baby
And I can play that game if you can
It's been a long time since I've come here
To give you what you need
My roots are in Chicago
But I know where I want to plant my seed
I, I'd bet a silver dollar
You, you'd love another
And you know that silver dollar, it would make me rich
Girl like you, easy pitch
But I miss you now you're gone
I'm coming home, girl, just to show you
What's this man's been living for
A tip for you, don't be surprised, baby
When I come busting through that door
T's been a long time since I've been here
To give you what you need
My roots are in Chicago
But I know where I want to plant my seed
I, I'd bet a silver dollar
You, you'd love another
And even though that silver dollar would make me rich
I want to tell you that there is a hitch
I miss you know you're gone
And all I got left is my old guitar
I, I'd bet a silver dollar
You, you'd love another
And even though that silver dollar would make me rich
I want to tell you that there is a hitch
I miss you know you're goneEmbed
