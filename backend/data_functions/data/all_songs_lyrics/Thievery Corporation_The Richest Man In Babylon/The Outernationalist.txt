The Outernationalist LyricsJah Rastafari
One heart
One love
One moon
One earth
One light
The almighty
Jah Rastafari
Unfathomable
Master builder of creastion
Jah rastafari
Who stands to rule and reign worldwide
Ras mean king
Tafari mean head creator
Supreme supremacy
Ruler among the mighty
He touched and lightning scorched
Rebuked the wind
And chastised thunder
The almighty
Him alone the only international field marshal
General Helaie-I SelasieEmbed
