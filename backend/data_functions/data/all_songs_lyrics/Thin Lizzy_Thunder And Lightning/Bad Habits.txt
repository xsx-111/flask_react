Bad Habits LyricsI seen you walking down the street with another man
Girl, you're really shocking
I seen you walking down the street with another hand
Held in your stockings
Boys will be boys and girls will be trouble
And I'm a man with bad habits
I seen you walking down the town with another, girl
Man, I had to have it
Bad habits
Bad habits
Bad habits
Well, boys will be boys and girls will be trouble
And I'm a man with bad habits
I seen you walking down the town with another man
And, girl, I had to have it
You and I, we should meet
Yeah, you and I, we should get together
Me and you and I should meet
In the rain and stormy weather
Bad habits
Bad habits
Bad habits
No messing around
Now's the time to settle down
Boys will be boys and girls will be trouble
And I'm a man of bad habits
I seen you walking down the street with another, girl
Man, I had to have it
I know it gets into your brain
Sometimes it dribbles and goes in your veins
I tell you this, boys is the same
This boy's got bad habits
You and I should meet
You and I, we should get together
You and I, you know we should meet
Hey, babe, check it out, the stormy weather
Bad habits
I got bad habits
I got bad habits
I got bad habits
I got bad habits
Bad habits
Bad habits
I got bad habits
Bad habits
I got bad habits
I got bad habits
I got bad habits
Drive me crazy, baby
Bad habits
Crazy, crazy, crazyEmbed
