This Is the One LyricsI've got to find an occupation
I've got to keep myself employed
It's a bad situation
My brain's destroyed
I've got to find a new vocation
I feel it burning down inside
Such a low down abrasion
Inside it hurts my pride
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Some day we will have won
I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Some day thy will be done
I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
Got a bad situation
I can feel it building up inside
Got a certain reputation
Outside, outside
I've got another situation
I can feel it building to my soul
Hell bent, hell raising
I feel it through my soul
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Some day thy kingdom come
I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Some day we shall overcome
I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Some day thy kingdom come
I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Ooh this is your son
I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Some day thy will be done
I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
I can feel it in my bones
This is the one
I hear it, I know it, I touch it, I feel it, I see it
Thy kingdom come
I can feel it in my bones
This is the oneEmbed
