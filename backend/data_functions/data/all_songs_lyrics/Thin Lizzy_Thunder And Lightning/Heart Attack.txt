Heart Attack LyricsMama, I'm dying of a heart attack, heart attack, heart attack
I love that girl but she don't love me back
My girl she tells me that we're breaking up, breaking up, breaking up
My heart can't handle the strain that's shaking it
She tried to tell me not so long ago
I would not listen but now I know
Papa, I'm drinking for an overload, overload, overload
The gun in my pocket is all ready to explode
Papa, I'm dying of an overdose, overdose, overdose
I tried to warn you don't you come too close
I tried to tell you way back when we were young
I tried to warn you there was something wrong
Mama, I'm dying
Oh Papa, I'm dying, dying, dying, dying, dying
Mama, I'm dying
Oh Papa, I'm dying, dying, dying, dying
Mama, I'm dying
Oh Papa, I'm dying, dying, dying, dying
Mama, I'm dying
Oh Papa, I'm dying, dying, dying, dying
