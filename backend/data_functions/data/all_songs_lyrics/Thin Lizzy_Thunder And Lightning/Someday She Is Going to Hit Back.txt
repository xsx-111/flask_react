Someday She Is Going to Hit Back LyricsWoman don't like it, hurting her this way
Some day she is going to hit back
The woman don't like me in her own way
Some day she is going to hit back
Woman don't like it, treating her like this
Some day she is going to hit back
The woman she don't love the lonely
Some day she is going to hit back
Woman don't like it, begging on her knees
Some day she is going to hit back
Oh please, please, don't desert me
Some day she is going to hit back
Woman don't like it, treating her this way
Some day she is going to hit back
There is tenderness in the heart of the lonely
Some day she is going to hit back
Some day she is going to hit back
Some day she is going to hit back
Some day she is going to hit back
Some day she is going to hit back
Woman don't like it
Woman don't like it
Woman don't like it
Woman don't like it
Some day she is going to hit back
Some day she is going to hit back
Some day she is going to hit back
Some day she is going to hit back
She feels so lonely, she feels so blue
Woman don't like it
He has lost her now
Woman don't like it
Oh woman
Woman don't like it
You knew what she could do
Woman don't like it
Woman don't like it, she says it has to stop
Some day she is going to hit back
The woman she says she doesn't love me
Some day she is going to hit back
Woman don't like it, the woman don't say a lot
Some day she is going to hit back
With one last kiss she leaves him lonely
Some day she is going to hit backEmbed
