The Holy War LyricsIf you will adore me
Bow before me and praise my name
If you place no god before me
Then all I have is yours to claim
And if God is in the heavens
Why did God let children die?
If you don't ask these questions
There is no reasons why
We are chosen, we are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way, this is the law
All the visions shown before you
All the kingdoms and the thrones
All are yours if you bow before me and adore me
All this you can own
There are those that will go to Heaven
There are those that will never win
No one knows what will happen
There are those that turn to sin
We are chosen, we are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way, this is the law
We are chosen, we are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way, this is the law
We are chosen
The devil is in hell with the demons
This is the Holy War
They'll lead us to our temptation
Lead us, take our souls
There is no evil in salvation
There is evil in us all
Just as Satan tempted Jesus
And Jesus slips and falls
He is a station on the cross now
He is dying to save us all
We are chosen, we are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way, this is the law
We are chosen, we are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way, this is the law
We are chosen, we are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way, this is the law
We are chosen, we are one
We are frightened of no one
And no one will win this war
This is the way, this is the law
If God is in Heaven, won't you save me now?
Oh Lord forgive them for what they've done
Lost children of Babylon
Oh Allah, oh no, oh no
This is the Holy WarEmbed
