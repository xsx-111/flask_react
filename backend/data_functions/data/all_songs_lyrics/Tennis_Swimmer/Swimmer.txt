Swimmer Lyrics
Some summer you have planned for me
Look at all these tourists as they flock to the sea
Gettin' in the water like it's nothing
But it's not without a consequence
I hear it comes quite naturally
But that description doesn't fit with me
Not going over, never going under
Not without a consequence

The narrows, the river
Empty into the sea

Some summer you have planned for me
Emptied into the sea
Some summer you have planned for me
Emptied into the sea
Oh, oh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah

Such a good man, had a good job
I'd take up swimming for the Patriarch
Now dispersed so casually like sediment into the sea
The swollen moon all flushed with red
One eclipse away from the bay of the dead
It ain't right, I'm telling you
It's more than coincidence
One stroke at a time, on my way back to land
It's better for me with my feet in the sand

Some summer you have planned for me
Emptied into the sea
Some summer you have planned for me
Emptied into the sea
Oh, oh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeahEmbed
