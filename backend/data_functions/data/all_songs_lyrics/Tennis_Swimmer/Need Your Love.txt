Need Your Love Lyrics
Baby, I'm fated but you will be waiting
I will have made it but you'll be explaining
What you think the world owes you
Looking for someone to carry you into
Futures that beckon but need to be followed through

I hope you're happy, I hope you're pleased
I thought you were a victim but it's clear to me

I need your love and I need your touch
Like I need a bolt of lightning from the sky above
I've been thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't escape you, oh
I'm thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't escape you, oh

Talking a lot like a prophet but there's no
Wisdom in what you've been saying and I
Can't seem to get a read on you
Burning your bridges and spreading around those
Rumors that sprout from the cracks in the ground, oh no
I hope you're happy, I hope you're pleased
I thought you were a victim but it's clear to me

Baby, you've got more poison than sugar
Baby, you've got more poison than sugar
Baby, you've got more poison than sugar
Baby, you've got more poison

I need your love and I need your touch
Like I need a bolt of lightning from the sky above
I've been thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't escape you, oh
I'm thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't escape you, oh

I can't escape your love, who could blame me?
Every time I hear your name, I go crazy
Ooh, pretty baby
Every time I hear your name, I go crazy

But I need your love and I need your touch
Like I need a bolt of lightning from the sky above
I've been thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't escape you, oh
I'm thinking about you, thinking about you
I can't escape you, oh
(I can't escape you)
(I can't escape you)
(I can't escape you)6Embed
