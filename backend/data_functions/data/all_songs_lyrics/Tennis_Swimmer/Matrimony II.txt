Matrimony II Lyrics
I only have certainty when you hold my hand
There's so much I don't understand
Baby, we've been orbiting each other helplessly
I guess that I blacked out but remembered to move my mouth
So much for my vows
More concerned with here and now

No one knows of love that's slow
Held like the longest breath
Or the gentle pull of gravity
That's being-unto-death
I can't go on living with a spark
That's only flickering
I only want that tenderness
With every moment left

I could never find something better
I even changed my name
By my side in every kind of weather
I'll never be the same
I could never find something better
I even changed my name
By my side in every kind of weather
I'll never be the same
"Come closer", you say
Black cats in the neighborhood
Aren't necessarily a sign of something
You know me so well
There goes the neighborhood
Let it all go burning down around us

No one knows of love that's slow
Held like the longest breath
Or the gentle pull of gravity
That's being-unto-death
I can't go on living with a spark
That's only flickering
I only want that tenderness
With every moment left to give, oh
To give, oh

I could never find something better
I even changed my name
By my side in every kind of weather
I'll never be the same
I could never find something better
I even changed my name
By my side in every kind of weather
I'll never be the same2Embed
