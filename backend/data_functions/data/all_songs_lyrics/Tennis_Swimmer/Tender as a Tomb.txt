Tender as a Tomb Lyrics
With my heart in my throat
And the sun on my face
Lying here in your arms
I know this is the place
I would never try to explain how it felt when we kissed
Courting reason in dreams while my body resists

I know my logic can lose you
But I think that we could get used to

My footsteps over the concrete blistering in June
My heart leaps over the concrete, oh, I live for you
Each footstep over the concrete, tender as a tomb
My heart leaps over the concrete, oh, I live for you

With my throat in my heart
And my face on the sun
In your arms, I will lay
'Til my dreaming is done
Buried under mountains of earth on the crest of a wave
Courting reason in love is a terrible waste
I know my logic can lose you
But I think that we could get used to

My footsteps over the concrete blistering in June
My heart leaps over the concrete, oh, I live for you
Each footstep over the concrete, tender as a tomb
My heart leaps over the concrete, oh, I live for you

Oh, I live for you
Oh, I live for you
Oh, I live for you
Oh, I live for youEmbed
