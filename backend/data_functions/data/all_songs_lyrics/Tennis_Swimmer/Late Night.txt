Late Night Lyrics
Late night carried by the wind
It took such a long time
To make up my own mind
Everything is changing
But I would not attempt to control you

I never could help myself
I waste my time
It's taking a toll on my health
I waste my own time
Like Mary Magdalene, I'm on my knees again
But if you see me as a saint
You'd be mistaken

Late night turning into morning blue
It took such a long time
To make up my own mind about you
Now the sun hangs heavy and I can't even lift my eyes
To where it sits indifferently
Unmoved mover of the sky

I never could help myself
I waste my time
It's taking a toll on my health
I waste my own time
Like Mary Magdalene, I'm on my knees again
But if you see me as a saint
You'd be mistaken
I am the master of my ship
My ship, the master of the sea
Through a rhetorical distinction
I think I'm finally feeling free
For the first time
For the first time1Embed
