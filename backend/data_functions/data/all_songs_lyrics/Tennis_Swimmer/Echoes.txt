Echoes Lyrics
Finally found a place to lay my head
Looks so good from down here on this hospital bed

I'll be the one to be undone
I'll go where the sun isn't shining
Once I was young
Those days are gone
Suddenly I'm 33 and on a gurney

Apologies and obligations
All the myriad sensations compounding

Echoes in my brain
Echoed in refrain
Always a replay
Like a Grecian tragedy
Oh, where the time goes
Who really knows?

You said, "Get a doctor, my wife's going under"
She's off where the sun isn't shining
I thought I would argue
Or cleverly bargain
It looks like I won't be going down stoically
Oh, to love you and be loved
To have the final memory of you compounding

Echoes in my brain
Echoed in refrain
Echoes all the same way, away
Away, away, ooh, ooh-ooh

Oh, where the time goes
Who really knows?
Oh, where the time goes
Who really knows?Embed
