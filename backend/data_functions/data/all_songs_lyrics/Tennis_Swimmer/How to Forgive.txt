How to Forgive Lyrics
You take your love so freely
Can't you go easy on me?
Hard to resist, harder to give up like a habit
Why do you go losing control? What are you looking for?
All this noise when I need silence
Love shouldn't feel like violence
Swallow your pride, open up wide, let the whole world in
Empty again, punish a friend, make 'em all suffer
It's so easy (I can't help it)

How could I disguise the way that I'm feeling?
I've got my reasons, I could give you a million
How could I disguise the way that I'm feeling?
I've got my reasons, I could give you a million

My mind has been divided
And I've been questioning myself
Can't keep on hesitating
It's starting to affect my health
Hard to resist, harder to give up my bad habits
Why do I go losing control? What am I looking for?
It's so easy
(I can't help it)
(I can't help it)
(I can't help it)
Oh, I know that I can't control
But it's so hard to let it go
All the worries, they keep coming back
And the disappointments from our past (I can't help it)

How could I disguise the way that I'm feeling?
I've got my reasons, I could give you a million (I can't help it)
I'd move on if I could only remember
All that it takes is just an act of surrender (I can't help it)
How could I disguise the way that I'm feeling?
I've got my reasons, I could give you a million (I can't help it)
I'd move on if I could only remember
All that it takes is just an act of surrender (I can't help it)
(I can't help it)
(I can't help it)1Embed
