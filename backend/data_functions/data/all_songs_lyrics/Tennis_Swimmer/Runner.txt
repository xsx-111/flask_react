Runner Lyrics
Runner, I know you're living with a wild hunger
Let me make the most of us
You know you’ll never be a runner
And leave me in a cloud of dust
Living in the same old sin
I feel it blowing in the wind
Like manna in the desert, oh
Gonna take a miracle

Every little bead of sweat
Feel it running down my neck
When you look at me like that
Feeling like we can't go back
If I become a pillar of salt
I'll know that it was all my fault
Every little bead of sweat
Every little bead of sweat

Runner, you’re just a bottomless pit of hunger
Lead me to the promised land
Your manna is only a famine
Wandering the desert, oh
Gonna take a miracle
Every little bead of sweat
Feel it running down my neck
When you look at me like that
Feeling like we can't go back
If I become a pillar of salt
I'll know that it was all my fault
Every little bead of sweat
Every little bead of sweat

Let me make the most of us
You know you'll never be a runner
And leave me in a cloud of dust
Leveled in a burning heat
Red Sea devouring me
Flowing over my stoned soul
Hey
Gonna take a miracle

Every little bead of sweat
Feel it running down my neck
When you look at me like that
Feeling like we can't go back
If I become a pillar of salt
I'll know that it was all my fault
Every little bead of sweat
Every little bead of sweat3Embed
