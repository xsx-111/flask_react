Cold Blooded Lyrics
Y'all know nothing 'bout the pimp game
I wanna thank Rick James for letting me do this song, thank you very much

Who are you? Girl, who do you belong to?
My point of view is: girl, I think you're hot!
If we talk, what words will I describe?
There's no dictionary book to explain how you look
Cause I think you're hot! (Sexy, sexy, sexy)

Cold blooded!
Girl, I think you're hot! (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded!

Who are you? Girl, what's your name and number?
Is it true? Girl, you think I'm hot
If we tried to get to know each other
You might find, you couldn't trade me for another
Cause I think you're so (Sexy, sexy, sexy)

Cold blooded!
Girl, I think you're hot! (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded!
Sweetheart baby, touch me, girl, where I wanna be touched
Don't ever complain, got ya in a cobra clutch
Love me tender, love me sweet
I wanna bust this nut in a Super Freak
Oh, you're a Super Freak, fuck me anywhere
You ain't scared to ever do a do-or-dare
I wanna undress you, hold your loosie tight
And I won't cum all night!

Cold blooded!
Cause I think you're hot! (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded, yeah!
Cause I think you're hot! (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded, baby!
Cause I think you're hot! (Woo!)
Cold blooded!
Cause I think you're hot! (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
(Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Ooh, baby!
Ooh, aww!
Ooh, baby!
Cold blooded!4Embed
