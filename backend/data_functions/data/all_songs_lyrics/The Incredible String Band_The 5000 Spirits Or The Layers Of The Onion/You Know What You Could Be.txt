You Know What You Could Be LyricsRead your book and lose yourself
In another's thoughts
He might tell you 'bout what is
Or even 'bout what is not
And if he's kind and gentle too
And he loves the world a lot
His twilight words may melt the slush
Of what you have been taught
You know what you could be
Tell me my friend
Why you worry all the time
What you should been
Listen to the song of life
Its rainbow's end won't hold you
Its crimson shapes and purple sounds
Softly will enfold you
It gurgles through the timeless glade
In quartertones of lightning
No policy is up for sale
In case the truth be frightening
You know what you could be
Tell me my friend
Why you worry all the time
What you should beEmbed
