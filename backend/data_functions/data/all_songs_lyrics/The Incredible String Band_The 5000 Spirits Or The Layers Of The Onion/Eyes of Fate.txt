Eyes of Fate LyricsOh, who can see in the eyes of fate?
All life alone in its chronic patterns
Oh, swan, let me fly you
To the land of no winds blowing
I know nothing, and know that I know nothing;
All is in the eye, and in its blinks of seeing
So just like the morning
The ghost of the following day
Listen: Ory, ory, ory.....
Rear the rollers wild and stormy
Echoes wholly only lonely long beforey, ory ory
All rivalry and opinion still cast their wild spells
Effort and contrariness change the directions of time
The lion still growls in your hollowness
Please let's be easy, please let's be friends
Watching and learning like small children
Till out of the morning is growing the strength of the day
Listen: Ory, ory, ory.....
Rear the rollers wild and stormy
Echoes wholly only lonely long beforey, ory, ory
Servant of fame or fame for a servant
You see what you see, you see seldom what is
Servant of fate or fate for a servant
You see what you see, you see seldom what is
Servant of fate, ohhhhhhEmbed
