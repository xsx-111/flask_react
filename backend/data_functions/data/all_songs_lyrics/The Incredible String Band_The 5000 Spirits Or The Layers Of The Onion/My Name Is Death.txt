My Name Is Death LyricsI am the question that cannot be answered
I am the lover that cannot be lost
Yet small are the gifts of my servant the soldier
For time is my offspring, pray, what is my name?
My name is Death, cannot you see?
All life must turn to me;
Oh cannot you see?
And you must come with me
You must come with me
I'll give you gold and jewels rare
And all my wealth in store
All pleasures fair
If I may live but a few short years more
Oh lady, lay your jewels aside
No more to glory in your pride
Tarrying here there is no way
Your time has come that you must away
And you must come to clayEmbed
