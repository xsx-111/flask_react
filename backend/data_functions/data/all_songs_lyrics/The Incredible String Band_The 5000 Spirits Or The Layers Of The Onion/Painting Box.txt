Painting Box LyricsWhen the morning of your eyes comes waking through my shadows
Leaving just a trace of twilight sleep
I whisper to the baby raindrops playing on my window
And tell them gently this is not the time that they should weep
For somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you
My Friday evening's foot-steps plodding dully through this black town
Are far away now from the world that I'm in
My eyes are listening to some sounds that I think just might be springtime
With daffodils between my toes I'm laughing at their whim
And somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you
Oh somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of you
The purple sail above me catches all the strength of summer
Fishes stop and ask me where I am bound
I smile and shake my head and say my little ship is sinking
But I kind of like the sea that I'm on, and I don't mind if I do drown
For somewhere in my mind there is a painting box
I have every color there it's true
Just lately when I look inside my painting box
I seem to pick the colors of youEmbed
