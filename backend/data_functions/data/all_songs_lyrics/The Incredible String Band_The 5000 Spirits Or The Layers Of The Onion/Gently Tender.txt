Gently Tender LyricsGently tender falls the rain
Washing clean the slate again;
But leave me please, behind my brain
This light doesn't shadow on her
Shadows dancing through the pink milk blankets
Where my mind lay dreaming gently of my loving you
Sometimes I think I was true
But then I loved the stone beneath my feet as much, usually
Gently tender snow-drop grows
See the past tense quietly go
Kill the chord but let me know
This light doesn't shadow on her
Shadows crawling through the green bush trees
Where my toes crept breathing lightly of my loving you
Sometimes I think I was true
But then I loved the stone beneath my feet as much, usually
Slowly spitting crawls the snake
See the branches bend and break
Venom that might easily shake
This light doesn't shadow on her
Good, good loving, she gave me good loving
Good, good loving, she gave me good loving
Good, good loving, she gave me good
And now all my wine is water
To her all my wine is water
All water, and my pearls are clear
She gave to me good loving
She gave to me good loving
Oohhhhhhh good lovingEmbed
