First Girl I Loved LyricsFirst girl I loved
Time has come I will sing you
This sad goodbye song
When I was seventeen, I used to know you
Well, I haven't seen you, now, since many is the short year
And the last time I seen you, you said you'd joined the
Church of Jesus
But me, I remember your long red hair falling in our faces
As I kissed you
Well, I want you to know, we just had to grow;
I want you to know, I just had to go
And you're probably married now, house and car and all
And you turned into a grownup, female, stranger
And if I was lying near you now
I wouldn't be here at all
Well, we parted so hard;
Me, rushing round Britain with a guitar
Making love to people
That I didn't even like to see
Well, I would think of you
Yes, I mean in the six sad morning
And in the lonely midnight
Try to hold your face before me
Well, I want you to know, I just had to go;
I want you to know, we just had to grow
And you're probably married now, kids and all
And you turned into a grownup, female, stranger
And if I was lying near you now
I'd just have to fall
Well, I never slept with you
Though we must have made love a thousand times
For we were just young, didn't have no place to go
But in the wide hills and beside many a long water
You have gathered flowers, and they do not smell for me
Well, I want you to know, I just had to go
I want you to know, we just had to grow
So it's goodbye first love, and I hope you're fine
Well, I have a sweet woman
Maybe some day to have babies by me
She's pretty
Is a true friend of mineEmbed
