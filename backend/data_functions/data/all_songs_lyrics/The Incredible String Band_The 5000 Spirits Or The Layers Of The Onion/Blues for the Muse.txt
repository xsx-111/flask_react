Blues for the Muse LyricsI wake up in the early when I see my day walk in;
I wake up in the early when I start to begin
I drink up my coffee to drive dreams away
And I think about leaving but remain for the day
Oh Glory but I just stay blind
Think about my loving, yes, some of the time
I want to take it easy
Ain't it hard like they say
But I can play
And most any morning, most any morning
I like to be born into my guitar day
They say it's all butterflies
Don't let your dreams get in your eyes
But Orpheus made the sunrise
Cause he knew how to play
She sings so fadey
Called the sweet guitar lady
She's a noted writer, I just can't seem to let her be
And she is my flower, I call her my easy hour
She's a low special, baby that's enough for me
And it's all right, you're in the graveyard now
Well it's all right, you're in the graveyard now
You may weep, you may moan
You may pass your life so gay
But lucky in life, I swear sometimes
Surely going to have to meet your leaving day
Well, she sings like the seashore
Tonight I'm going to ride on your seesaw
I will call up the Angels if they have a little word to say
And I think I'll try cloudwalking
It's just my face you see here talking
And it's just the guitar singing
And I have to let her have her wayEmbed
