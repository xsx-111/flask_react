Southern Point LyricsOur haven on the southern point is calling us
Our haven on the southern point is calling us
And faced with all the obvious she'll carry us
Avert your eyes from all of this, we'll make it all back
In the end
You'll never find
You'll never find
In the end
You'll never find me now
In the end
You'll never find me now
You'll never find
But I'll return to you
You'll never find
When you return to me
In the end
In the end
You'll never find
You'll never find
In the end
You'll never find me now
In the end
You'll never find me now
You'll never find
But I'll return to you
You'll never find
When you return to me
In regards to the last word
It's not the last you'll hear
I'd never find any other
I could ever
I could ever
Never say it's the last one
It's not the last one
I'd never find any other
I could ever
I could ever1Embed
