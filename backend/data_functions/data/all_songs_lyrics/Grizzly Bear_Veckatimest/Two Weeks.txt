Two Weeks Lyrics
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Save up all the days
A routine malaise
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay
Oh oh oh oh

Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

Oh oh oh oh
Think of all the ways
Momentary phase
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay
Every time you try
Quarter half a mile
Just like yesterday
I told you I would stay
Oh oh oh oh
Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

Would you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Make it easy?
Take your time

Always
Sometimes
Easy
Time

Oh oh oh oh
