About Face Lyrics
Without a trace, makes me wonder
A staged race has no thunder
This is the case of our blunder

It's a fire for what?
Time for faith we thought

About face, makes me wonder
And in this case, there is no thunder
A bit of grace in our blunder

It's a fire for what?
Time for faith we thought

It's a fire for what? (For what?)
Time for faith we thought (We thought)
It's a fire for what? (For what?)
Time for faith we thought (We thought)2Embed
