While You Wait for the Others Lyrics
While you wait for the others
To make it all worthwhile
All your useless pretensions
Are weighing on my time
You could beg for forgiveness
As long as you like
Or just wait out the evening
You'll only bleed me dry
Yes, you'll only bleed me dry

So I'll ask you kindly to make your way
And what was left?
A perfect cleft
We all fall through

While you wait on the answers
That I'll pretend to find
Keeping up with the motions
Still occupies our time
You could hope for some substance
As long as you like
Or just wait out the evening
And always ask me why
Yes, you'll only bleed me dry

So I'll ask you kindly to make your way
And what was left?
A perfect cleft
We all fall through
And all we want
And what was left6Embed
