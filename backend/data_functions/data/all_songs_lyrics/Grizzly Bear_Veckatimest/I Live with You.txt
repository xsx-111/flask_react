I Live with You LyricsReturn
Been gone too long
Return
Don't make me beg
Return
And they'll try, they'll try
They'll try
To keep us apart
And they'll try, they'll  all try
To keep us apart
But yes we can
You brought us this far
We'll do what we can
Return
Don't put me on
Return
Don't make me beg
Return
And they'll try, they'll try
They'll try
To keep us apart
And you'll try, You all try
You'll try to keep us apart
But yes we can
You brought us this far
We'll do what we can2Embed
