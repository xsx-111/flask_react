Fine for Now Lyrics
There was time, it took time
Impossible
There is time, so much time

All of the kids on the waterfront shyly raise their hands
Done asking for your permission, please understand

If we're all faltering, how do I help with that?
If it's all or nothing, then let me go
If we're all faltering, why'd I help with that?
If it's all or nothing, then let me go

There was time, it took time
Impossible
There is time, so much time
There is time, so much time

All of the kids on the waterfront shyly raise their hands
Done asking for your permission, please understand

If we're all faltering, how do I help with that?
If it's all or nothing, then let me go
If we're all faltering, why'd I help with that?
If it's all or nothing, then let me go1Embed
