All We Ask Lyrics
In this old house, I'm not alone
In a bedroom, a telephone
You made a call and I just stood by
I stripped the sheets and emptied out the sty
And the crowds that light the carnival are
Calling us home
Calling us home
And all we want's another voice
To lead us along
Lead us along
Lead us along

Even wasting my time with you
Doesn't matter if I think it through
You took the car around another bend
Ran it in the ground, let's pretend

And the crowds that light the carnival are
Calling us home
Calling us home
And all we ask, another voice
To lead us along
Lead us along
Lead us along
I can't
Get out
Of what I'm into
With you
I can't
Get out
Of what I'm into
With you
I can't
Get out
Of what I'm into
With you
I can't
Get out
Of what I'm into
With you6Embed
