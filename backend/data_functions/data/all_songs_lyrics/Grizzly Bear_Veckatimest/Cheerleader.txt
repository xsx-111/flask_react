Cheerleader Lyrics
Mention a name, we know (we know)
Appear tame, it shows (shows)
Please don't feign, the ropes (the ropes)
Always the same, I know (know)

(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)

(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
God, let it go, it doesn't mean a thing
(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
Chance and sow, nothing changing

There's no time to go (to go)
Through the designs we know (we know)
Never mind, although (although)
Maybe this time, we'll grow (grow)

(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
God, let it go, it doesn't mean a thing
(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
Chance and sow, nothing changing
(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
God, let it go, it doesn't mean a thing
(I'm cheerleading myself, I shouldn't really matter)
Chance and sow, nothing changing
