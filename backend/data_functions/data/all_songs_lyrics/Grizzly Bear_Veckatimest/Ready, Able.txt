Ready, Able Lyrics
I'm going to take a stab at this
Surely we'll be alright
Make a decision with a kiss
Maybe I have frostbite
And when I shuffled on back home
I made sure all of my tracks in the snow
Were gone

Tissue and bones it was a tryst
This isn't a gunfight
Checking it off of my list
Unable to rewrite
Five years, countless months and a loan
Hope I'm ready, able to make my own
Good home

They go, we go
I want you to know
What I did, I did
They go, we go
I want you to know
What I did, I did
They go, we go
I want you to know
What I did, I did
They go, we go
I want you to know
What I did, I did
They go, we go
I want you to know
What I did, I did
They go, we go
I want you to know
What I did, I did12Embed
