Foreground LyricsTake on another shift
Palms in the middle, hands in the middle
Work out another rift
Something is muffled, another juggle
This is a foreground
It is a foreground
A cross country miss
Take direction, can't connect it
I'm afraid this is
Ten detected, nine in a wreck and...
A little jetty fight
Pattern evolving, motion insolvent
Something about this might
Take all evening, I'll just be cleaning
This is a foreground
It is a foreground3Embed
