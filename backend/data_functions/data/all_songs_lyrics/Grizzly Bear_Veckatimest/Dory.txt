Dory Lyrics
Oh, wildly coherent in a watery deep
We'll drop her down to the bottom
We'll drop her down like she's nothing and the water is all
Oh, the water is still in a wilder deep
We'll swim around like two dories
We'll swim around like two dories let loose in the bay

We'll miss the eddy
Hold on, make steady, go
There is no plenty
Even keel already, go

I can't be here all hours (Oh, such a riot)
I can't discern this trouble (Oh, what a riot)
I can't be here all hours (Oh, such a riot)
I can't describe


I can't be here all hours (Oh, such a riot)
I can't describe this problem (Oh, what a riot)
I can't be here all hours (Oh, such a riot)
I can't describe this problem
Oh
Oh
Oh
