As I Lay My Head Down LyricsAs I lay my head down
Upon that grassy field
Winter’s passing
Soon will fall
No one will ever know
The end
The end
The end is all we need
As I lay my head down
Upon that grassy field
You won’t find me
I’ll be gone
No one will ever know
Oh, look at the years going by
No, troubles come into your life
Oh, now that you finally have found the end
The end
The end is all we needEmbed
