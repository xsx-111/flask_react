Woodwind LyricsAnd on the world I have
No nothing ever seems so
Any day
Any day
We return back
I will stand here
Nothing ever seems so
Any day
Any day
We return back
Watching the fire come into the night until you find sleep
Watching the years go by into the light until you find the one
Into the sun
Any day
We return to the fires
Any day now
We return to the firesEmbed
