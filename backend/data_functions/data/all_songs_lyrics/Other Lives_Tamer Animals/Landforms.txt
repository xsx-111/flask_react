Landforms LyricsI am watching the ground below from above
Founding all of the shapes we know
Oceans and planes are
Oceans and planes are
Landforms are forming
The oceans and planes
I see the old ones dying away…
Land formed all that it comes between
See how all of it used to be one…
Oceans and planes are
Oceans and planes are
Landforms are forming
The oceans and planes
I see the old ones dying away…Embed
