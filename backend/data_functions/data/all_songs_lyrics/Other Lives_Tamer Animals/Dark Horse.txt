Dark Horse LyricsOh the rise and come in full
There you will find out
What lies within you
Yes you've grown old
But I'm listening as we go
Where you are is where you were before
Reminds me where I'm going
We're bringing down the dark horse
Bringing down the dark horse
Bringing down the dark horse
We're bringing down the dark horse
Oh the lies they come and go
Whether they're made up
No fire was in you
Yes you've grown old
But I'm listening as we go
To find out more of where you were before
Reminds me where we're going
We're bringing down the dark horse
Bringing down the dark horse
Bringing down the dark horse
We're bringing down the dark horseEmbed
