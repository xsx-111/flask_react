Desert LyricsDesert
Reclaims the land
And we return full in colour
Dark Sea
Don't bother me
When water turns into land
Oh our end
Has come at last
And we return full in colour
Oh I see
I see the fires ahead
But in my mind
It's turning cold
The Sun
Will freeze
And our fate don't bother me
The rise
Of the sea
Does not concern me when
All of your city lights
Turn you brightest day
Into sleepless night
But it's not me
No, it's not me
The Sun
Will freeze
And our fate don't bother me
The rise
Of the sea
Does not concern me when
All of your city lights
Turn your brightest day
Into sleepless night
And the rising and all
You are now watching out
But it's not me
No it's not me
It's not me, It's not meEmbed
