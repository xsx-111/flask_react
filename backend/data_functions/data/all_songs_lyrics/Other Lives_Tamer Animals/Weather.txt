Weather LyricsWe turn to dark
We feel thin air
We can survive
When nothing is there
We built the city
We dig the Earth
Steel and the fire
We find our worth
We control weather
We like to roam
All of our days, all of our days
We control weather
We feel thin air
We can survive
When nothing is there
Our days are numbered
The Sun is getting closer to the world
We turn to dark
We feel thin air
We can survive
When nothing is there
We built the city
We dig the Earth
Steel and the fire
We find our worth
We control weather
We like to roam
All of our days, all of our daysEmbed
