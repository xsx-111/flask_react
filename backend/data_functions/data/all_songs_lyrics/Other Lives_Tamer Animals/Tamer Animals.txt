Tamer Animals LyricsSolitary motion in the wake of an avalanche
Deer in the headlights, there goes a weaker one
He's listenin' in the fast gaze, I don't care now to see the way
Do you hear the silence? I was far too late
Oh, living for the city and it's always troubling
To keep it in the hot lane, I don't care about no scenery
And you run from it then, now you can't escape
'Cause it's all you see
But we're all just an end to a simple thing
And it's all you see and it's all you see
We're just tamer animals
We're just tamer animals
Solitary motion in the wake of an avalanche
We took a hit then, trying to see if you hold it in
And you run from it then, now you can't escape
'Cause it's all you see
But we're all just an end to a simple thing
And it's all you see and it's all you see
We're just tamer animals
We're just tamer animals
We're the same as animalsEmbed
