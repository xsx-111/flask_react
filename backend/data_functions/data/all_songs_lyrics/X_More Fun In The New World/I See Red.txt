I See Red Lyrics
She wore blue, her bad luck blue shoes
He wore green for go, they went out any way
She and their car wore black through the red light
"Stop, I forgot all my memories"

I see red when I see you
Fan belts break at three AM
I get mad, drinks get spilled
At five past two, I don't feel sad
But then I see you
And I see red

I can't look down or I might fall on you
I might follow in your footsteps
I see a showdown at sundown, what's the lowdown?
I had to hunt, I had to hunt you up

I see red when I see you
Fan belts break at three AM
I get mad, drinks get spilled
At five past two, I don't feel sad
But then I see you
And I see red, haha
He sees the sun come up and she needs rest
Here comes a creepin' so close to the bed
"Good morning darkness, I see your shining face"
She's always thinkin' about the facts of life

I see red when I see you
Fan belts break at three AM
I get mad, drinks get spilled
At five past two, I don't feel sad
But then I see you
And I see redEmbed
