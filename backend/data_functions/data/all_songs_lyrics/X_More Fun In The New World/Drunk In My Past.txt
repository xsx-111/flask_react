Drunk In My Past LyricsIt's the drunk in my past
Shuffling by like a train
Sounds on its tracks like a ride
Like a ride that don't last
Swears each drink is the last
Tells the same lie each night
And breaks every promise
Till she makes me go crazy
She's gonna drive me to drinking
There's a drunk in my past
The one who let me down
Who wasn't around when I needed
There's a drunk in my past
Who swears each drink is the last
Thought I give him another chance
There's a dunk in my path
Each time I go past my house
I'm trying to find my way home
My door way is blocked
By doomsday for certain
When your own key don't fit
You know it's curtains
Oh well, never a dull moment
Never a moment passes
When someone dull don't pass me by
I love her like a sister
That drunk that girl
Why I wish her all the best?
That's all that's left
'Cause she took the rest
One heck of a past
There's a drunk in my past
The one who let me down
Who wasn't around when I needed
There's a drunk in my past
Who swears each drink is the last
Thought I give him another chance
There's a dunk in my path
Each time I go past my house
I'm trying to find my way homeEmbed
