Devil Doll LyricsShe won't get out of bed
Shake her snaky hair
Grab her, throw her in the tub
She says, "Coffee and a piece of pie"
She never wears a dress on Sunday
Or any Monday afternoon
This is no goddamn country to wander alone
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Devil doll, devil doll
People turn their heads
She scares little kids
Eyes narrow, jaw is set
She'll fix you with a stare
She keeps her body hidden
Let's her eyes make her bid
I'd wrap her up in a bullet
And shoot her round the world
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Devil doll, devil doll
She won't get out of bed
Shake her snaky hair
Grab her, throw her in the tub
She says, "Coffee and a piece of pie"
She never wears a dress on Sunday
Or any Monday afternoon
This is no goddamn country to wander alone
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Rags and bones and battered shoes
Devil doll, devil doll
Devil doll, devil doll1Embed
