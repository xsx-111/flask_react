The New World LyricsHonest to goodness
The bars weren't open this morning
They must have been voting for a new president of something
Do you have a quarter?
I said, "Yes", because I did
Honest to goodness, the tears have been falling
All over this country's face

It was better before, before they voted for What's-His-Name
This was supposed to be the new world
It was better before, before they voted for What's-His-Name
This was supposed to be the new world
Flint Ford Auto
Mobile, Alabama
Windshield Wiper
Buffalo, New York
Gary, Indiana
Don't forget the Motor City
Baltimore and D.C
Now all we need is

Don't forget the Motor City
This was supposed to be the new world
Don't forget the Motor City
This was supposed to be the new world
All we need is money
Just give us what you can spare
Twenty or thirty pounds of potatoes
Or twenty or thirty beers
A turkey on Thanksgiving
Like alms for the poor
All we need are the necessities and more

It was better before, before they voted for What's-His-Name
This was supposed to be the new world
It was better before, before they voted for What's-His-Name
This was supposed to be the new world

Don't forget the Motor City
This was supposed to be the new world
Don't forget the Motor City
This was supposed to be the new worldEmbed
