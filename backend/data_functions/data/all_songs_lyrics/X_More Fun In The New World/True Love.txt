True Love LyricsTrue love, true love, true love, true love
True love, true love is the devil's crowbar
Pulled out, pulled apart, torn apart by finding out
Loneliness is fine, then you find someone who has to stay away
It pulls apart your wishbone but you get to wish
Loneliness is never the same again
It becomes true love, true love, true love, true love
True love, true love is the devil's crowbar
He uses it to pry you out of your car and into the arms of
The devil drives a Buick, he sits inside and eats lunch
Then he sticks his pitchfork through the trunk and into the spare
And he pulls out
True love, true love, true love, true love
True love, true love is the devil's crowbarEmbed
