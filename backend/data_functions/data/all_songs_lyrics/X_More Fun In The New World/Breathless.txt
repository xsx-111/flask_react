Breathless LyricsNow if you love me, please don't tease
If I can hold, well, then let me squeeze
My heart goes 'round and 'round
My love comes tumblin' down
You leave me, ahh
Breathless, ahh
Well, I shake all over and you know why
I'm sure it's love, honey, it ain't no lie
'Cause when you call my name
You know I burn like wooden flame
You leave me, ahh
Breathless, ahh
Ooh baby, you're driving me crazy
You're much too much
I can not love you enough
It's alright, hold me tight
When you love me, love me right
Come on baby, now don't be shy
This love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet of snow
I'm gonna getcha wherever you go
You leave me, ahh
Breathless, ahh
Ooh baby, you're driving me crazy
You're much too much
I can not love you enough
It's alright, hold me tight
When you love me, love me right
Come on baby, now don't be shy
This love was meant for you and I
Wind, rain, sleet of snow
I'm gonna getcha wherever you go
You have left me, ahh
Breathless, ahhEmbed
