True Love (Part 2) LyricsHey!
True Love
True Love
True Love
True Love
True Love is the Devil's bombshell
It's the Devil's dragstrip
It is the Devil's stock car
It's the Devil's nightshade
Quicksand
Quicksand
Sickbed
Sickbed
Punchbowl
Punchbowl
Low blow
True love is the Devil's Yes Man (oh yeah man!)
It is the Devil's hothouse
It's the Devil's lunchbox
It's the Devil's wishbone
True love is the Devil's doorknob
It's the Devil's pass key
It is the Devil's chokehold
It's the Devil's widow
True Love
True Love
Lay-off
Heave ho
Lean-to
Hobo!
True love is the Devil's countdown
It is the Devil's A,B,C

Hot car
Zip-gun
Hypo
Roadhouse
Zoot suit
Cash box
Roadblock
