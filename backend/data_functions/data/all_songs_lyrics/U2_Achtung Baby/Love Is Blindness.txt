Love Is Blindness Lyrics
Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my heart
Love is blindness

In a parked car in a crowded street
You see your love made complete
Thread is ripping, the knot is slipping
Love is blindness

Love is clockworks and cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle, blow out the candle
Love is blindness

Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
Blindness

A little death without mourning
No call and no warning
Baby, a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense
Love is drowning in a deep well
All the secrets and no one to tell
Take the money, honey
Blindness

Love is blindness, I don't wanna see
Won't you wrap the night around me?
Oh, my love
