Here She Comes Now Lyrics
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now

Oh, she looks so good
Oh, she's made out of wood
Just look and see
She's made out of wood
Just look and see now, now, now
Made out of wood now

Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now

Oh, she looks so good
Oh, she's made out of wood
Just look and see
She's made out of wood
Just look and see now, now, now
Made out of wood now


Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now

Oh, she looks so good
Oh, she's made out of wood
Just look and seeEmbed
