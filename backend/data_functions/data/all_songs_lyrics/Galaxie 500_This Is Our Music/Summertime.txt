Summertime Lyrics
Nighttime at the boulevard
And I'm walkin' home with you
The heat is just delicious
And you know just what to do

Mornin' is so perfect
But the noontime makes me tired
Walkin' in the park now
And I'm so glad that you were fired

Goin' to the movies
I found a shelter from the sun
Heard a gruesome story
About a couple on the runEmbed
