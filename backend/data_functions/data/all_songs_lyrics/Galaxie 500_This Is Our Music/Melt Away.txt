Melt Away Lyrics
My hair will turn to yellow
My eyes will turn to green
My voice will turn to mellow
But still I can't be seen

Melt away
I wanna melt away
Melt away

Can you tell the difference
Or do I sound the same?
I do just what I want to
This is my favorite game

Melt away
I wanna melt away
Melt away


Melt away
I wanna melt away
Melt away
Melt away
I wanna melt away
Melt away
