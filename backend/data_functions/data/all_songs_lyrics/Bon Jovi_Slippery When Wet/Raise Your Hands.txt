Raise Your Hands Lyrics
Oh
Ooh yeah

You
You got a nasty reputation
We're in a sticky situation
It's down to me and you
So tell me, is it true?
They say there ain't nobody better
Well, now that we're together
Show me what you can do

You're under the gun
Out on the run
Gonna set the night on fire
Out on the run
Under the gun
Playin' to win

Raise your hands
When you wanna let it go
Raise your hands
And you wanna let a feeling show
Raise your hands
From New York to Chicago
Raise your hands
From New Jersey to Tokyo
Woah, raise your hands
I
I've been out on the front line
Where you'll go down if you waste time
They'll walk all over you
But I
I ain't here lookin' for surrender
I'll raise the flag if you'll defend her
It's up to you

You're under the gun
Out on the run
Gonna set the night on fire
Out on the run
Under the gun
Playin' to win

You got to raise your hands
When you wanna let it go
Raise your hands
When you wanna let a feeling show
Raise your hands
From New York to Chicago
Raise your hands
From New Jersey to Tokyo
Woah, raise your hands
Woah, raise your hands
Alright, let's go
Raise your hands
Raise your hands

Raise your hands
When you wanna let it go
Raise your hands
And you wanna let a feeling show
Raise your hands
From New York to Chicago
Raise your hands
From New Jersey to Tokyo
Woah, raise your hands

Raise your hands
New York
Raise your hands
Detroit
Raise your hands
Vancouver
Raise your hands
Hey, London
Raise your hands
Sayreville, New Jersey
Raise your hands
Phoenix
Raise your handsEmbed
