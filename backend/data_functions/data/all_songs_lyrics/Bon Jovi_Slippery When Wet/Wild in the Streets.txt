Wild in the Streets Lyrics
Joey comes from a sacred part of town
Where sometimes you talk so tough
Your feet don't touch the ground
And the sidewalk soldiers sing the midnight blues
While the old men recite their storylines
'Bout when I was young like you

They say (Oh yeah)
We were cruisin' to the backbeat
(Oh yeah) Makin' love in the backseat

And ooh, we were wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets

A member of the boy's brigade
Had a date with the girl next door
You know it made her daddy crazy
It only made her want him more
But they weren't looking for trouble
That boy didn't want a fight, not tonight
So she headed out through her bathroom window
What her daddy didn't know was gonna be alright
She said (Oh yeah)
We're cruisin' to the backbeat
(Oh yeah) Makin' love in the backseat

And ooh, we were wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets
We were wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets
Rock me


Sometimes this town ain't pretty
But you know it ain't so bad
Just like a girl who looks so happy
When inside she's so, so sad
In here, we got this code of honor
No one's goin' down
You don't walk in vain
Through the kid's parade
'Cause this is my hometown

Wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets
And we were wild, wild in the streets
Wild, wild in the streets
Yeah, we were wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Wild in the streets
Oh, we were wild in the streets
Woah-oh-oh, wild in the streets
Woah-oh-oh, wild in the streets
WildEmbed
