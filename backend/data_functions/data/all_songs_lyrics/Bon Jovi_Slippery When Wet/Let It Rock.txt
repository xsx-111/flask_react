Let It Rock Lyrics
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

The weekend comes to this town
Seven days too soon
For the ones who have to make up
What we break up of their rules

Well, I saw Captain Kidd on Sunset
Tell his boys they're in command
While Chino danced a tango
With a broomstick in his hand
He said, "It's alright (Alright)
If you have a good time
It's alright (Alright)
If you wanna cross that line
Break on through to the other side"

(Let it rock) Let it rock (Let it go) let it go
You can't stop a fire burnin' out of control, let it rock
(Let it rock) Let it go (Let it go)
With the night we're on the loose
You gotta let it rock
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

We go down to the Broadway
Where everybody goes
To get up on their rockin' horse
Blast that radio

Yeah, I saw Roxie on the table
Her girlfriend down below
They'll give it up to the king of swing
Before it's time to go
"It's alright (Alright)
If you have a good time
It's alright (Alright)
If you wanna cross that line
Break on through to the other side"

(Let it rock) Let it rock (Let it go) let it go
You can't stop a fire burnin' out of control, yeah, let it rock
(Let it rock) Let it go (Let it go)
You can't stop a fire burnin' out of control, let it rock
(Let it rock) Let it go (Let it go)
With the night we're on the loose
We're gonna let it rock, yeah
Let it rock

(Let it rock) Let it rock (Let it go) let it go
You can't stop a fire burnin' out of control, let it rock
(Let it rock) Let it go (Let it go)
With the night, well, we're on the loose, said everybody, sing

Woah-oh-oh (Yeah)
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh (Hey)
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh (Alright)
Woah-oh-oh (Ooh, yeah)
Woah-oh-oh (Ooh, yeah)
Woah-oh-ohEmbed
