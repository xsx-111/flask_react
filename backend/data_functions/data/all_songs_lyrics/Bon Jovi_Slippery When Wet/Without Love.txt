Without Love Lyrics
She wasn't young, but still a child
There was still innocence in faded smiles
She called to me as I passed her by
Lady of the night looked in my eyes

She said, "I've been through some changes
But one thing always stayed the same"

Without love, there's nothing without love
And nothing else can get you through the night
'Cause nothing else feels right without love, woah

I saw a man down on Lonely Street
A broken man who looked like me
And no one knows the pain that he's been livin'
He lost his love and still hasn't forgiven

He said, "I've been through some changes
But one thing always stays the same"

Without love, there's nothing without love
And nothing else can get you through the night
'Cause nothing else feels right without love
There's nothing without love
Nothing else but love can burn as bright
'Cause nothing would mean nothing without love, woah
I see my life
Some things I took for granted
Love's passed me by
So many second chances
I was afraid
I won't be afraid no more

Without love, there's nothing without love
Nothing else can get you through the night
Nothing else feels right without love
There's nothing without love
And nothing else but love can burn as bright
'Cause nothing would mean nothing without love

There's nothing without love
And nothing without love
Nothing without loveEmbed
