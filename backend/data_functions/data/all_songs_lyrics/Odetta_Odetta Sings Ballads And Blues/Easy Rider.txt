Easy rider, see what you done
Easy rider, see what you done
Hey, hey
Made me love you, now yo' woman done come
Made me love you, now yo' woman done come
Made me love you, now yo' woman done come
Hey, hey, hey, hey
When you see me comin', honey, honey
H'ist yo' windows high
See me comin', honey, h'ist yo' windows high
See me leaving, hang yo' head an' cry
Hey, hey, hey, hey
If I was a headlight on some western train
I'd shine my light on cool Colorado Springs
I'd shine my light on cool Colorado Springs
Hey, hey, hey
Well I'm goin' to the nation and the territo'
Lord I'm tryina find, honey, a honey man I know
Tryina find, honey, a honey man I know
Hey, hey, hey
If I was a catfish and I was swimmin' in the deep blue sea
Lord I'd keep them men from fussin' over me
Keep them men from fussin' over me
Hey, hey
Easy rider, see what you done, done
Hey easy rider, see what you done, done
Easy rider, see what you done, done
Hey, hey, hey, heyEmbed
