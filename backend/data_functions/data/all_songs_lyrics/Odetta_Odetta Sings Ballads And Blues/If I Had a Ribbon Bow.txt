If I Had a Ribbon Bow LyricsIf I had a ribbon bow to bind my hair
If I had a fancy sash, my love would think me fair
And when he goes to frankfurt, a-logging on the rise
He'd bring me back with his own hands, a very pretty prize
If I had a ribbon bow to bind my hair
If I had a fancy sash, my love would think me fair
If I was like city girl and fair with smart
Not a lad in all these parts would know my heart
And then I'd live in Frankfurt
Where all the lovers go
I'd lark about them settlements
And wear them foreign clothes
If I had a ribbon bow to bind my hair
If I had a fancy sashEmbed
