Joshua LyricsJoshua fit the battle of Jericho
My lord, Jericho, well-a, Jericho
Well-a Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And them walls come tumblin' down
You may talk about your men of Gideon
Talk about the men of Saul
But there's nothing like good old Joshua
At the battle of Jericho
A morning when Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
My lord, Jericho, well-a, Jericho
Well-a Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And them walls come tumblin' down
Well now up to the walls of Jericho
He marched with a spear in his hand
Go blow them ram horns, Joshua said
'Cause his battle is in my hands
A morning when Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
My lord, Jericho, well-a, Jericho
Well-a Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And them walls come tumblin' down
Ah the ram, lamb, sheep horn began to blow
And the trumpets began to sound
Joshua commanded his children of Saul
And walls come-a tumblin' down
A morning when Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
My lord, Jericho, well-a, Jericho
Well-a Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And them walls come-a tumblin' down
Well them walls come-a tumblin' down
Well them walls come-a tumblin' downEmbed
