Alabama Bound LyricsI'm Alabama bound
I'm Alabama bound
And if this train don't stop and turn around
I'm Alabama bound
Oh, don't you leave me here
Please don't leave me here
But if you leave me here
If you're gonna leave me here
Leave a dime for beer
I'm Alabama bound
I'm Alabama bound
And if this train don't stop and turn around
I'm Alabama bound
Just a poor boy, nah
(?)
That whistle blow, another man done gone
Another man done gone
Alabama bound
Alabama bound
Alabama bound
Alabama bound
If this train don't stop and turn around
I'm Alabama bound
Alabama boundEmbed
