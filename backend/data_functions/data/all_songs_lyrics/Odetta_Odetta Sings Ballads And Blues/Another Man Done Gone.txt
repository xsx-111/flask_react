Another Man Done Gone LyricsAnother man done gone
Another man done gone
Another man done gone from the county farm
Another man done gone
I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name
I didn't know his name, didn't know his name
Didn't know his name
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on
He had a long chain on, had a long chain on
Had a long chain on
They killed another man
They killed another man
They killed another man, killed another man
Killed another man
Another man done gone
Another man done gone
Another man done gone from the county farm
Another man done goneEmbed
