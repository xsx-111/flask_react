Muleskinner Blues LyricsGood morning, Captain
Good morning, son
Good morning, Captain, good morning, son
D'you need another muleskinner
On your noon mule run?
Been working on the railroad
I got a dollar and a dime a day
Been working on the railroad
Dollar and a dime a day
Three women waitin' on a Saturday night
Just to draw my pay
I like to work
Rolling all the time
I like to work
Rolling all the time
I can carve my initials
On any mule's behind
Good morning, Captain
Good morning, son
Good morning, Captain, good morning, son
D'you need another muleskinner
On your noon mule run?
Hey there, you little water-boy
Bring your bucket round
Hey there, you little water-boy
Bring your bucket round
If you donâ€™t like your job, then buddy
Put your bucket down
Good morning, Captain
Good morning, sonEmbed
