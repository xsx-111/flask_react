Take This Hammer LyricsAh you can take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Ah you can take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Ah you can take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Tell him I'm gone, boys
Tell him I'm gone
I don't want these your cold iron shackles
I don't want these your cold iron shackles
I don't want these your cold iron shackles
Around my leg, boys
Around my leg
If he ask you, was I running
If he ask you, was I running
If he ask you, was I running
Tell him I'm flyin', boys
Tell him I'm flyin'
If he ask you, was I laughing
If he ask you, was I laughing
If he ask you, was I laughing
Tell him I'm cryin', boys
Tell him I'm cryin'
I don't want your corn bread and molasses
I don't want your corn bread and molasses
I don't want your corn bread and molasses
It's my pride, boys
It's my pride
Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Take this hammer, carry it to the captain
Tell him I'm gone, boys
Tell him I'm goneEmbed
