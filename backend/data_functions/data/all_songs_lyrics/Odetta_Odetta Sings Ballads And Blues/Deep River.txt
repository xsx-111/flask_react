Deep River LyricsDeep River
My home is over Jordon
Deep River
Lord I wanna cross over into campground
Oh don't you want to go
To that Gospel feast
That promised land
Where all is peace?
Walk into Heaven
And take my seat
And cast my crown
At Jesus' feet
Deep River
My home is over Jordon
Deep River
Lord I wanna cross over into campgroundEmbed
