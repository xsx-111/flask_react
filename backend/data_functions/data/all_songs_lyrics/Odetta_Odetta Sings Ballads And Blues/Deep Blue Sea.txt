Deep Blue Sea LyricsDeep blue sea, baby, deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, baby, deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, baby, deep blue sea
It was willy what got drownded
In the deep blue sea
Dig his grave with a silver spade
Lower him down with a golden chain
Dig his grave with a silver spade
It was willy what got drownded
In the deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, baby, deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, baby, deep blue sea
Deep blue sea, baby, deep blue sea
It was willy what got drownded
In the deep blue seaEmbed
