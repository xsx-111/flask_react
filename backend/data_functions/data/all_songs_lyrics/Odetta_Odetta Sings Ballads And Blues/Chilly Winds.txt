Chilly Winds LyricsGoing where the chilly winds don't blow, honey baby
Going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going to my long lonesome home
Who'll haul your cotton when I'm gone, honey baby
Who'll haul your cotton when I'm gone
When I'm gone to my long lonesome home
Way down in jail on my knees, honey baby
Way down in jail on my knees
They feed me on ah corn bread and beans
Make me a pallet on your floor, honey baby
Make me a pallet on your floor
I'm going to my long lonesome home
Going where the chilly winds don't blow, honey baby
Going where the chilly winds don't blow
I'm going to my long lonesome homeEmbed
