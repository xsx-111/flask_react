Been in the Pen LyricsBeen in the pen so long
Honey, I'll be long gone
Been in the pen and I gotta go back again
My little honey, where you been so long?
Baby, where you been so long?
Awful lonesome, all alone and blue
Awful lonesome, all alone and blue
All alone and blue, no one to tell my troubles to
Honey, where you been so long?
Baby, where you been so long?
Some folks like Memphis, Tennessee
Some folks like Memphis, Tennessee
Some folks like Memphis, but New Orleans is the place for me
Honey, where you been so long?
Baby, where you been so long?
Been in the pen so long
Honey, I'll be long gone
Been in the pen, lo' I gotta go back again
Honey, where you been so long?
Baby, where you been so long?Embed
