Santy Anno LyricsWe're sailing cross the river from liverpool
Heave away, santy anno
Around cap horn to frisco bay
Way out in californio
So, heave her up and away we'll go
Heave away, santy anno
Heave her up and away we'll go
Way out in californio
There's plenty of gold, so I've been told
Heave away, santy anno
Plenty of gold, so I've been told
Way out in californio
So, heave her up and away we'll go
Heave away, santy anno
Heave her up and away we'll go
Way out in californio
Well, back in the days of forty nine
Heave away, santy anno
Back in the days of the good old times
Way out in californio
So, heave her up and away we'll go
Heave away, santy anno
Heave her up and away we'll go
Way out in californioEmbed
