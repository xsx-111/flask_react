Shame and Scandal LyricsWhoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
There was a family, lived on the island of
San Sebastian for a long, long while
The head of the family was a Holland man
The youngest brother his name was Rand
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
The Holland man kept in the tower
A wife as pretty as a big white flower
She saw the brother, she stole his heart
And that's where the trouble and the bubbling start
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
The wife and the brother, they wanna go
But the Holland man he tell them no
The wife fall down and the evil came
Burned her mind in a voodoo flame
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
Her eyes are empty, she cannot talk
A nurse has come to make her walk
The brothers are lonely, the nurse is young
And now you know my tale is sung
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the family
Whoa me
Shame and scandal on the familyEmbed
