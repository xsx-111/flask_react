Hound Dog LyricsHound dog, bay at the moon
Lift up your long, skinny head, and bay at the moon
Hound dog, bay at the moon
God did forsake us and it gives me much pain
Now he's forgotten how to make it to rain
Hound dog, bay at the moon
My well's gone dry, chickens won't lay
Fish they stopped biting last Saturday
Hound dog, bay at the moon
Lift up your long head, bay at the moon
Hound dog, bay at the moon
For the bread's gone weevily, sorghum gone bad
Kinfolk have eat what little I had
Hound dog, bay at the moon
Rotten potato, and an old tote sack
Pain in my belly and my back
Hound dog, bay at the moon
Lift up your long head, bay at the moon
Hound dog, bay at the moonEmbed
