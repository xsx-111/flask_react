Burnt Out Town LyricsYeah!
I was walking down the street the other day
A woman stopped me
She said: why are you looking so down in the mouth?
And I told her
This is a burnt out town
It's full of dirty looks
There's ashes on Main Street
And the mayor is cooking the books
Even my best friends
Are turning into crooks
Yeah this is the burnt out town
New Emperor, same clothes
They dancing on glass ceilings
While the filthy money flows
Yes and here I am stealing gas, with a garden hose
Yeah!
Take that, honey!
This is a burnt out town
The city fathers have come to blows
It's out of their realm of reality
The truth's indecent when exposed
Yeah, it's the burnt out town
It's going down but no one knows
Yeah, it's the burnt out town
Ain't dead but getting close1Embed
