Red River LyricsShe’s got a 3D Jesus in a picture frame
Got a child she never named
She shakes a snake above her hair
Talks in tongues when there’s no one there
So meet me tonight by the Red River
Where the water is clear and cold
Meet me tonight by the Red River
And look down into your soul
Look down into your soul
She’s got a rosary and a rabbit’s foot
A black cat bone that keeps her good
A tiger tooth and a gris-gris stick
Still it don’t do the trick
So meet me tonight by the Red River
Where the water is clear and cold
Meet me tonight by the Red River
And look down into your soul
Look down into your soul
I’m gonna walk her down to Gypsytown
Find the spirit queen I’ve seen around
Paint her body up in mud and clay
Let the river wash it all away
So meet me tonight by the Red River
Where the water is clear and cold
Meet me tonight by the Red River
And look down into your soul
Look down into your soul
Look down into your soulEmbed
