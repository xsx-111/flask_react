Fault Lines LyricsSee those fault lines
Lay down like land mines
It's hard to relax
A promise broken
The ground breaks open
Love falls through the cracks
And I've got a few of my own
I've got a few of my own fault lines
Running under my life
Running under my life
I'm alone here
I play the odds, dear
I go where I please
Down the road
A man I know might not be me
And I've got a few of my own
I've got a few of my own fault lines
Running under my life
Running under my life
On the high-wire, above the wildfire
An odd acrobat
On faulty cable, still heâ€™s able
Not to fall flat
And I've got a few of my own
I've got a few of my own fault lines
Running under my life
Running under my lifeEmbed
