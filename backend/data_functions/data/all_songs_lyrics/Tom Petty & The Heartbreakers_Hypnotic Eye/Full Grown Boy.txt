Full Grown Boy LyricsI like to move on sure and easy
Like a cat creeps through the grass
And the full moon seems to know me
'Cause I've found myself at last
And I'm a full-grown boy
And there's laughter on the hillside
From voices far away
How am I gonna tell her that I love her?
When this might not be the day
And I'm a full-grown boy
Hey, my mind floats away
Yeah, and I'm changing every day
Can you see her in the firelight
Hear how soft and low she sings
How am I gonna tell her that I love her?
When words don't mean a thing
And I'm a full-grown boyEmbed
