U Get Me High LyricsI remember feeling like this
I think it was as a child
Inspiration at my fingertips
Imagination running wild
Ohhh ohhh, you get me high
You get me high
You give me something so deep
You get me high
I remember feeling this way
You can lose it without knowing
You wake up and you don't know which way
The wind is blowing
Ohhh ohhh, you get me high
You get me high
You give me something so deep
You get me high
I ain't afraid of what people say
Ain't afraid of the great deception
Every bad dream comes my way
Turned to smoke on closer inspection
Ohhh ohhh, you get me high
You get me high
You give me something so deep
You get me high
You get me high
You get me high
You give me something so deep
You get me high1Embed
