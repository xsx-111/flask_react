Shadow People LyricsShadow people, what's in their head?
In the car next to you, when the light turns red
Could be thinking of love, might be thinking of hate
I guess it pretty much could go either way
Shadow people, in shadow land
That one's thinking of great art
And eloquent words
That one's strapped on a gun
And joined up with the herd
That one's saving up water
Got some food stored away
For the war that is coming on the judgment day
Shadow people, in shadow land
And this one carries a gun for the USA
He's a 21st Century man
And he's scary as hell
'Cause when he's afraid
He'll destroy anything he don't understand
Well I ain't on the left
And I ain't on the right
I ain't even sure
I got a dog in this fight
In my time of need
In my time of grief
I feel like a shadow's falling over me
Like shadow people, in shadow land
Shadow people, in shadow land
Waiting for the sun to be straight overhead
'Til we ain't got no shadow at all1Embed
