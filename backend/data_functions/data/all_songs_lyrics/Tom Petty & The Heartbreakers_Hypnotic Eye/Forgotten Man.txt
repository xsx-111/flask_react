Forgotten Man LyricsWell I feel like a forgotten man
I understand the dark
When it hangs upon the water
When the wolves and dogs all bark
Well I feel like a forgotten man
I feel like a forgotten man
Well I feel like a four letter word
I know what few can do
How angry words can pierce the heart
How a soul can sink so low
I feel like a forgotten man yes
I feel like a forgotten man
Well I feel like I'm forever damned
Since our love is gone
No lust, no rage, no wicked thoughts
Just pain, that lingers on
I feel like a forgotten man
I feel like a forgotten man yes
I feel like a forgotten manEmbed
