Power Drunk LyricsWho's gonna come and take this badass down?
Who's gonna come burn this other playhouse down?
Can you see me against the sun
Crying out to reach someone
He's power drunk
Yeah, look at his eyes
Better sober up
It's the truth within him makes a good man rise
God protect us from the thoughts in some men's minds
God protect us from the pain he leaves behind
Now you see him against the sky
Believing in his own lies
And he's power drunk
Yeah, look at his eyes
Better sober up
It's the truth within him makes a good man rise

Pin on a badge and a man begins to change
Starts believing that there's nothing out of his range
You and I are left in the wind
In the wake of a rich man's sin
And he's power drunk
Yeah, look at his eyes
Better sober up
It's the truth within him makes a good man rise
Make a good man riseEmbed
