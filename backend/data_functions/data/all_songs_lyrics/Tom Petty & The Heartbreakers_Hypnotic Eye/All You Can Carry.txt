All You Can Carry LyricsI saw a ghost by the road tonight
And then my mind ran away with me
I had a vision in the changing light
Something saying that it's time to leave
Take what you can, all you can carry
Take what you can and leave the past behind
Take what you can, all you can carry
Take what you can and leave the past behind
We gotta run
I saw the flames come across the ridge
Falling ashes in the northern wind
You and I have burned every bridge
And now we've got to save our souls again
Take what you can, all you can carry
Take what you can and leave the past behind
Take what you can, all you can carry
Take what you can and leave the past behind
We gotta run
There's something moving in the dark outside
I gotta face it when it hits the light
No one can say I didn't have your side
No one can say I left without a fight
Take what you can, all you can carry
Take what you can and leave the past behind
Take what you can, all you can carry
Take what you can and leave the past behind
We gotta run1Embed
