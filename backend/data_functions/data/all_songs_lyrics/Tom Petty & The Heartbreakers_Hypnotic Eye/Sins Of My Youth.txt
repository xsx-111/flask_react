Sins Of My Youth LyricsYou will find no wicked way in me
Look me over, you will see
You will find no weary change
I'm worn and wounded, but still the same
Oh, let me tell you the truth
I love you more, than the sins of my youth
When the past gets up in your face
Memories slide out of place
All those things that were hidden away
Ain't so bad in the light of day
Oh, let me tell you the truth
I love you more, than the sins of my youth
You say you love me, wish you liked me more
I'm no angel, that's for sure
Said you forgave me each time I was caught
But you still paint me as something I'm not
Oh, let me tell you the truth
I love you more, than the sins of my youth
I love you more, than the sins of my youthEmbed
