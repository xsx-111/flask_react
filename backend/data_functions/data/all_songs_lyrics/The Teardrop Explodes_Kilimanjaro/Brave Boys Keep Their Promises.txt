Brave Boys Keep Their Promises LyricsBrave boys keep their promises
They fight fight fight their way up to the top
Holding back the images
To give them all the running start
But they move on, the less get on the next step
Braving all the elements
All the things that nature throws at you
Fighting for the first time
It's hard for you and it's hard for me
But we keep on now, we're always moving
Move, move
Brave boys keep your promises
You gotta do do do do do the things they say
Fighting with your relatives
You got your mother and your father and your brothers too
Your aunts, your uncles, are all against youEmbed
