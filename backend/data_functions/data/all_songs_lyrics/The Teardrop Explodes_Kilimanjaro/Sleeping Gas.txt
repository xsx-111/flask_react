Sleeping Gas LyricsSometimes I wonder if you're really living
Oh what is this feeling you think that you're giving
Well you can sit down, wrecked and dismayed
Wondering where are all the plans that you laid
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
Just like a cartoon by AAP
Oh it's just like a cartoon by AAP, oh yeah
Oh whether to phone you
Or whether to see you
I never do anything
You never do things for me
I wander around
I just wander around
I just wander around
I just wander around
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
So here comes my head
And my hand just behind oh yeah yeah yeah
I stand in the street
I look for someone to meet
But you don't call me or phone
Oh you're never alone
I wander around
I just wander around
I just wander around
I just wander around
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
Just like a cartoon by AAP
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
You can watch rafferty turn into a serial
It's just like sleeping gas
It's so ethereal
I wander around
I just wander aroundEmbed
