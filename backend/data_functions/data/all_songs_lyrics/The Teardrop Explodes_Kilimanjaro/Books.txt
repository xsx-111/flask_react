Books LyricsYou said you couldn't find anyone to love you
I said there's more to life than a broken heart dear console you
I've seen it in your eyes
And I've read it in books
Who wants love
Without the looks
Well you said I spend my life chasing rainbows
Oh I said that's a clich√© phrase and anyway I like it when the rain goes
I've seen it in your eyes
And I've read it in books
Who wants love
Without the looks
And I came a long way before I came across the sea
Oh I did love for you and what did you do for me
Oh but I'm gonna be strong
And it's getting much stronger
It may take a week
But it won't be longer
No no no noEmbed
