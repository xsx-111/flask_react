Went Crazy LyricsI'm in my room I'm looking sideways
I look up and I look down
They told my friends it was a secret
But it's rumored that some of us went crazy
So I packed all my clothes and I went on back home
I was standing on the tarmac ready to go
Then I looked all around and I looked all around
And I looked all around and I went crazy
But I sincerely sad and resigned
I look up and I rest sometime
Then I think for a while and I sit for a while
And I sit for a while and I went hazy
Oh I go
If you have a daughter bounce her on your knee
If you have a son send the blighter off to sea
If you have a daughter bounce her on your knee
If you have a son send the blighter off to sea
If you have a daughter bounce her on your knee
If you have a son send the blighter off to sea
If you have a daughter bounce her on your knee
If you have a son send the blighter off to sea
Oh yeah
Well fun and games and laughter for the chosen few
Here comes your nose and here comes you
Je suis suicide, je suis pain
Jabber indecision here we go again, I'm going
Oh we're in love with beauty
We're in love with health
We're in love with mental health
I'm going crazyEmbed
