Second Head LyricsLook, look into my eyes
Outside, sudden footsteps
Take control, control of your movement
Wait, I'm still hoping, hoping
I'm still hoping
Like a second head
Is it the first one you started out with
Seen, seen from the stars
I know the banister's leaking
That I can breathe freely, that I can breathe freely
I wait, oh I wait for a sign, hoping and praying
Hoping it's mine
Like a second head
Is it the first one you started out with
Oh you can see much more, but can you learn
Don't throw anything
I'm scratching my back while you're scratching the surface
Beware, beware of false promises
You must be wary of people, the knives in their backs
Like a second head
Is it the first one you started out with
Waiters and callers
Trapped by the door, looking for something
That I didn't come for
Decisions, decisions, it's only a sign
But what and who is this, well next time
Like a second head
Is it the first one you started out withEmbed
