When I Dream Lyrics
I've been thinking about you
I hope that you've been thinking about me
I've been talking about you
I've been talking about you in my sleep

And when I dream I dream about you
And when I scream I scream about you
I go ba ba ba ba oh oh
I go ba ba ba ba oh oh
Oh I go

I've been sad and ever sadder
I've been living, living far away
Now it's you I think it's true
And I'm running, running back to stay

And now I'm counting I'm counting for two
And when I shout I shout about you
I go ba ba ba ba oh oh
I go ba ba ba ba oh oh
Oh I go
Here you come again
Playing with my feelings
There you go again
Playing with my heart

And when I dream I dream about you
And when I scream I scream about you
I go ba ba ba ba oh oh
I go ba ba ba ba oh oh
I go ba ba ba ba oh oh
I go ba ba ba ba oh oh
And when I dream I dream about you
And when I scream I scream about youEmbed
