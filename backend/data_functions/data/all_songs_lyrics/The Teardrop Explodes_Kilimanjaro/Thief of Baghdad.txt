Thief of Baghdad LyricsYou went into my room last night
And you took everything that I need
You left me there with stars in my eyes
Oh I know it's not love it's agreed
Street signs glowing
But it doesn't leave a mark on you
I was looking for a sign to change my mind
But I never thought that I'd see you
You wandered into my dreams last night
And you stood them all up in a row
You trampled all over them with stones in your shoes
And you said "Oh yeah, I thought that you'd know"
Street signs glowing
But it doesn't leave a mark on you
I was looking for a sign to change my mind
But I never thought that I'd see you
Oh but my head is aching
And my back is breaking
And my bodies quaking
Oh and my hands are shaking
I need somebody to come and take me away
I've been climbing this hill with the sun on my back
I've been climbing and climbing all day
Then you walk in my room and you laugh in my face
You said, "I thought you'd gone out to play"
Street signs glowing
But it doesn't leave a mark on you
I was looking for a sign to change my mind
But I never thought that I'd see youEmbed
