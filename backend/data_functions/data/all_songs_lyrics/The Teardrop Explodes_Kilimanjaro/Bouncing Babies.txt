Bouncing Babies Lyrics
I was a bouncing baby
I fell down
I looked around
I didn't stay too long

And it's true
It's true
It's true
All the things that they tell you

Oh it's all there
For you to see
And so why is it
All so easy for me

'Cos it's true
It's true
It's true
They cling to things
When they've got nothing they can believe in
Believe in
I was a poisoned child
I was fighting for my life
Clinging to something
Fighting for anything

And It's true
All the things that they tell you
Oh it's all true
All the things that they said that they said
That they tell you

I was a bouncing baby
Now I'm a bouncing bomb
So won't you come and diffuse me
Before I kill someoneEmbed
