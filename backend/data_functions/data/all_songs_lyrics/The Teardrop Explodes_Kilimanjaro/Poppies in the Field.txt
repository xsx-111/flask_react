Poppies in the Field LyricsThe parachutes in my bag
I'm throwing it over to you
The parachutes in your hands
But don't ask me what to do
The poppies are in the field
But don't ask me what that means
The poppies are in the field
But don't ask me what that means
I wait around
I wait around
I see a change in you
Can you see a change in me
But I can't explain at all
I can't explain what I feel
Comics insult you said
But comics are all I read
Comics insult you said
But comics are all I read
I wait around
I wait around
I wait around
I wait around
Wait around
I see a change in you
Can you see a change in me
But I can't explain at all
I can't explain what I feel
The poppies are in the field
But don't ask me what that means
The poppies are in the field
But don't ask me what that means
I wait around
I wait around
Wait aroundEmbed
