Conqueror Lyrics
All the colours that we saw, they touched us
And all the trails that they made, we followed
And we can be just like all of the others
And we have to be just like all of the, the others

All the spaces they made for us are all filled up
And they will deceive us and they will desert us
But all our, our colours will always be with us
And all our, our colours will always be with us


All our colors will always be with us
And all our, our colours will always be with us
All our colors will always be with us
And all our, our colours will always be with usEmbed
