Transfigure LyricsIt's the same feeling
It's like i'm still reeling
Where there's no feeling
I still need you right now
Would you do it better
Is that how it's done just right
Is it then perfect
You are so clever
It's the same feeling
Like i'm still reeling
When there's no feeling
I still need you nowEmbed
