Solitude Lyrics
I'm sitting here alone in darkness, waiting to be free
Lonely and forlorn, I am crying
I long for my time to come, death means just life
Please let me die in solitude

Hate is my only friend, pain is my father
Torment is delight to me
Death is my sanctuary, I seek it with pleasure
Please let me die in solitude

Receive my sacrifice, my lifeblood is exhausted
No one gave love and understanding
Hear these words, vilifiers and pretenders
And please let me die in solitude

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust

Sitting here alone in darkness, waiting to be free
Lonely and forlorn, I am crying
I long for my time to come, death means just life
Please let me die in solitude
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes
And dust to dust

And please let me die in solitude5Embed
