Crystal Ball Lyrics
Black heart, your soul is mine, mine, mine
Gaze into and the secrets you'll find, find, find
Just read the signs

Gaze into the crystal
See what it tells
It can bring you all fortune
Do you so well
Visions and dreams you can see
In the crystal ball

The crystal ball
In the crystal ball
The crystal ball

I saw the rainbows end
I am raptured, I cannot pretend
I have found Atlantis
The talisman of Seth

Gaze into the crystal
See what it tells
It can bring you all fortune
Do you so well
Visions and dreams you can see
In the crystal ball
The crystal ball
The crystal ball

I have seen it all
Gaze into the crystal ball
Tell me more I want to know
Please hear my call

Gaze into the crystal
See what it tells
It can bring you all fortune
Do you so well
Visions and dreams you can see
In the crystal ball

The crystal ball
The crystal ball
