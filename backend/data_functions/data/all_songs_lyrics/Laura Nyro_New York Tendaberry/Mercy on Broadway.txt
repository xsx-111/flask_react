Mercy on Broadway LyricsMadison smiled
And she hung with a band of strays
The band was gone
Bringin it on
To the Broadway blaze
Once I lived under the city in my sweet July
July mercy on broadway
Don't you believe it
You better know what I say
She'll make you pay
Down the alleyway
Slippin up a sidestreet
Shine
Everybody
Shine
On Broadway
Jive and pray
There ain't no mercy now
On Broadway
People and the landlords shine
Down and gay wine
In the doom swept the band away
Baby on broadway
Is she mild
Like mother and child?
Does she obey?
Once I lived under the city in my sweet July
July mercy on broadway
Don't you believe it
You better know what I say
She'll make you pay
Black city fair
Ole road runner there
Shine
Everybody
ShineEmbed
