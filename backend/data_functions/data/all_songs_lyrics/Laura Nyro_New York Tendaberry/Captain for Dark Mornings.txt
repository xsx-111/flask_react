Captain for Dark Mornings LyricsI am soft and silly
And my name is Lillianaloo
And sir you're grace in action
To my satisfaction, woo...
Well, my mama she's savin'
'Cause my daddy's a ravin' crazy gambler
But you my captain are grace in action
To my satisfaction, ooh...
Come along now and I'll be your woman if you'll be my captain
Said, I'll be your woman if you'll be my captain
Said, I'll be your woman if you'll be my fearless captain, yeah
Die! I would lay me down and die, for my captain
You, for you...
I am soft and silly and my name is Lillianaloo
Sir, you're fair black fashion
For this winter's passion, ooh...
I've been sold by sailors
I've been worn by tailors
Soldiers wound me
But you my captain are medication for my reputation, woo...
Come along now and I'll be your woman if you'll be my captain
Said, I'll be your woman if you'll be my captain
Said, I'll be your woman if you'll be my fearless captain
Die! I would lay me down and die, for my captain
Captain, say yesEmbed
