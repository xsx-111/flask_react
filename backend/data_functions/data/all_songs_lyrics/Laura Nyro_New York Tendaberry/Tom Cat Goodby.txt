Tom Cat Goodby LyricsTom Cat Goodby
Rosie Pearl is a big blonde girl
And she sails around like a Steamboat!
Takes her time, and her eyes... they shine...for...Tom...
Hey there Tom Cat
Where've you been to?
Hey there Tom Cat
Say, where've you been to?
I'm so lonely
I been crying - waiting up for you
Ya hear that?!
Ya hear that?!
I got your name Tom
I got your children
What about the children?
Tom cat Tom cat
You old rat - you old rat
Where've you been to?
Johnny cheated, Frankie killed him
Johnny cheated, said Frankie killed him
Shot and killed him
I don't blame her. I'd'a done it too
Ya hear that?!
Ya hear that?!
You deal and promise
You kiss and swing low
Foot slippin' out the window
Tom Cat Tom Cat
You old rat - you old rat
Where've you been to?
You know you're never gonna make a moviemaker, Tom
You know you're never gonna make a moviemaker -TOM!
You know you're never gonna make a moviemaker
Always be a silly faker - Tom - Tom
Never gonna make a movie maker, Tom
Oh Tom oh Tom
Never gonna make a movie maker
Never make a movie maker
Never gonna make a movie maker
Always be a silly faker
No, Tom! I can't go on Tom
I can't keep pushin', and pushin', pushin', pushin' on
Pushin' on
I quit lovin you
Lovin you...
Baby, I'm going to the country
Gonna buy me land
I'm going to the country
To kill my lover man
Gonna kill my lover
Gonna kill my lover
Gonna kill my lover man
Gonna kill my lover man
Gonna kill my lover - Man
You know Tom, he don't care
He don't care....
You know Tooooom!
Run like a chicken from the Pan, baby
What'd you say now?
Hey there Tom cat
He walks like a tom cat
He runs like a tom cat
Goes fishing like a tom cat
He cheats like a tom cat
He Lies!
Can I find him...
Can I find him..
Can I find him..
Gonna kill... him
My... Lover - Man...(man)
My MAN!Embed
