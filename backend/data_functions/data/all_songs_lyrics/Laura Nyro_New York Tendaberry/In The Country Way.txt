In The Country Way LyricsMy old man
He’s a Peter Pan
In the city, hey
In the country way
Don’t tell me ‘bout country
My old man
He does what he can
In the city, hey
In the country way
In the country way, hey
Hey, in the country way
High heel tall
And that ain't all
In the city, hey
In the country way
Don’t tell me ‘bout country
Don’t ask how
But he’s a big boy now
In the city, hey
In the country way
In the country way, hey
Hey in the country way
Doo doo-doo, yeah
Don’t ask how
But he’s a big boy now
In the city, hey
In the country way
All in the country way
All in the country way
Hey, babyEmbed
