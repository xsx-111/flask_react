My Exit, Unfair LyricsMy exit unobserved
And my homesickness absurd
I said "water" expecting the Word would satisfy my thirst
Talking all about the second and third
When I haven't understood the first
Jonah, where's that boat going...
Your ship set with eager sails?
There's a swirling storm soon blowing
And no use, fishermen
In rowing from the consecrated whale!
And just like the clouds
They bring a darkness
And a hard rain's going to fall
I felt the crowd
Bring a loneliness and a hard rain
A hard rain's going to fall
And she'd always weigh me down
But, afraid I might need her
I dragged her around
It's best to keep close sackcloth and ash
In a whitewashed town
She wore that phony smile on her face
I guess like a bandage on a wounded place
While I kept the keys to every old lock just in case
Rehearsed indifference tossed aside
Our narrow arms spread wide
What unseen pen etched eternal things
On the hearts of human kind
But never let them in our minds?
Oh, the clouds they brought a darkness
And a hard rain's gonna fall
And all my laughter ends in emptiness
And a hard rain's gonna fall
My every medicine causes more illness
And a hard rain's gonna fall
And until I let you go
Oh, I didn't know
You were never mine
You were never mine at all
But now I spend my days in ever-increasingly complicated ways
Convincing myself of the rightness of each word I say
My exit, unfair if unobserved!
My exit, unfair if unobserved!
My exit, unfair...
Ya sabur, subhannallahi, a'udhu billahi minash-shaitanir-rajim
