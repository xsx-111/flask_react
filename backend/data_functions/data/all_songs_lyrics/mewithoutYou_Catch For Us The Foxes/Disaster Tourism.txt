Disaster Tourism LyricsCall me outside, I'll come running down
You call me outside, I'll come running down
Call me outside, I'll come running down
You call me outside, I'll come running down
When I satisfied each need invented by my eyes
I was a nest by a fox's hole
Or dirt underneath your boot soles
When I satisfied each need invented by my eyes
Till it was nothing like I'd imagined, oh
Like cocaine, their green eyes fixed
On the television to pass the time
Until their two miles of elegant blinds
Halfway raised for the watching as you walked by
"Look, come to the window...
She carries a candle at mid-day!
While the sun's still so high!"
But you knew better than to pay mind
To what people and the Devil say
Call me outside, I'll come running down
Into your vacant, intoxicating night
If you call me outside
To their haunted streets
Their red electric lights!
Oh, I'm on the sad side of a nowhere town
But sister I'm all you've got
So call me outside, I'll come running down...
Then, not another wordEmbed
