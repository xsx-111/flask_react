January 1979 LyricsJanuary 1979,
Saw a terrible crash
(and I couldn't help but laugh)
My ear pressed against the past
Like a glass on a wall of a house in a photograph
My forehead no longer sweet
With holy kisses
Worthy of your fiery lips
I was floating in a peaceful sea
Rescued by a sinking ship
If I could become the servant of all
No lower place to fall
(If I could be your servant)
If I could become the servant of all
No lower place to fall
(If I could be your servant)
If I could become the servant of all
No lower place to fall
(I could be your servant)
If I could become the servant of all
No lower place to fall
(If I could be your servant)
You watch me like a ten car highway wreck
With detached, vulgar curiosity
This looking down on the tops of the hats
Of us passersby from your seventh floor balcony
And from such a height you missed
Creatures too small for sight carry on covert conversation
As the misguided insects crown me their grasshopper king
With a dance of celebration
After years with their crown on my head
I've grown overfed, unconcerned
And comfortably numb
Kept busy indulging in the pleasures of the wealthy
(Oh, someone make me afraid of what I've become!)
At the first sign of possible sorrow
I'll turn my heel and run, (Oh, I'll never learn)
My life's a cup of sugar I borrowed
Before time began and forgot to return
(I could be your servant)
It was a matter of time
I always said I could see, but now I'm going blind
(If I could be your servant)
It was a matter of time
I always said I could see, but now I'm going blind
(I could be your servant)
It was a matter of time
I always said I could see, but now I'm going blind
(If I could be your servant)
It was a matter of miserable time
But I heard somewhere, there was a cure for useless eyes4Embed
