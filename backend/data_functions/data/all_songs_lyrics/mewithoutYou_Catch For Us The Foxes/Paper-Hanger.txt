Paper-Hanger Lyrics
Her not one motion or gesture could I forget
The prettiest bag lady I ever met
Pushing her cart in the rain
Then gathering plastic and glass
She watched the day pass
Not hour by hour... but pain by pain
And I was a basket filled with holes
And she was the sand I tried to hold
That ran out behind me
As I swung at some invisible hand

I stopped believing, you start to move
(She was like wine turned to water then turned back to wine)
I stopped my leaving and the better man bloomed
(And you can pour us out and we won't mind)

I was dead then alive
She was like wine turned to water then turned back to wine
You can pour us out, we won't mind
A scratch around the mouth of the glass
My life is no longer mine

And if you're still looking for a blanket, sweetie
I'm sorry, I'm no sort of fabric
But if you need a tailor
Then take your torn shirt
And stumble up my stairs
And mumble your pitiful prayers
And in your tangled, knotted sleep
Our midnight needles go to work
Until all comfort and fear
Flows in one river
Down in the shop by the mirror
Where you see yourself whole
And it makes you shiver
I stopped believing, you start to move
(And she was like wine turned to water then turned back to wine)
I stopped my leaving and the better man bloomed
(And you can pour us out and we won't mind)

I was dead then alive
She was like wine turned to water then turned back to wine
You can pour us out, we won't mind
A scratch around the mouth of the glass
Our lives are not our own

Even the wind lay still
Our essence was fire, and cold, and
Movement, movement, oh
If they ask you for the sign of the Father in you
Tell 'em it's: Movement, movement, movement, oh!
And repose2Embed
