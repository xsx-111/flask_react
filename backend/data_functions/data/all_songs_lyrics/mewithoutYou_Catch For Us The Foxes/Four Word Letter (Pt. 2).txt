Four Word Letter (Pt. 2) LyricsI wrote a four word letter
Post-script in crooked lines
"Though I'd lived I'd never been alive."
And you know who I am
You held my hem
As I traveled blind
Listening to the whispering in my ear
Soft but getting stronger
Telling me the only purpose of my being here
Is to stay a bit longer
Wielding a bicycle chain
As the handlebars crashed to the ground
The back wheel detached from the frame
It kept rolling yeah
But aimlessly drifting around
Oh Doubters
Lets go down
Lets go down
Won't you come on down?
Oh Doubters
Lets go down
Down to the river to pray
"But I'm so small I can barely be seen
How can this great love be inside of me?"
Look at your eyes
They're small in size
But they see enormous things
Wearing black canvas slippers
And our frog-on-a-lily-pad pose
We sewed buttons and zippers
To Chinese pink silk and olive night clothes
If you can someday stop by
Somehow we'll show you the pictures
And fix you some tea
See, my dad's getting a bit older now
And just unimaginably lonely
Oh pretender
Lets go down
Lets go down
Won't you come on down?
Oh pretender
Lets go down
Down to the river and pray
"Oh but I'm so afraid
I'm set in my ways"
But he'll make the rabbits and rocks sing his praise
"Oh but I'm too tired
I won't last long"
No he'll use the weak to overcome the strong
Oh Amanda
Lets go down
Lets go down
Won't you come on down?
Mama, Nana
Lets go down
Down in the dirt
By the river to pray
A wick to fit the wax
Wood to fit the wire
You strike the match
Why not be utterly changed to fire?
And sacrifice the shadow in the mist
Of a brief life you never much liked son
If you'd care to come along
We're gonna curb all our never-ending
Clever complaining
And who's ever heard of a singer criticized by his song?
We hunger
Though all that we eat brings us little relief
We don't know quite what else to do
We have all our beliefs
But we don't want our beliefs
God of peace
We want youEmbed
