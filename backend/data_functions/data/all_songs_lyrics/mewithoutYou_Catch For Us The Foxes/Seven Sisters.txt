Seven Sisters Lyrics
He made the world a grassy road
Before our bare, wandering feet
(He made the world a grassy road
Before our bare, wandering feet)
Then crushed the stones
Into the softest sand between our toes
(Then crushed the stones
Into the softest sand between our toes)
But we're wondering where to sleep
Oh, but clever words
On pages turn to fragments, circles, points and lines
And they cover them like carpets
With graceful, meaningless, ornamental designs

Come quick, You Light that knows no evening...
Come, alone to the alone!
I have a thousand half-loves well worth leaving
For to take your madness home
And You dance inside my chest where no one sees You
But sometimes I see You
(Come quick, You Light that knows no evening...
Come, alone to the alone
There's a thousand half-loves well worth leaving
For to take your madness home
And You dance inside my chest
Etcetera... etcetera... etcetera!)
Oh, rejoice, the Cleansing of my lips...
Rejoice, Salvation of my soul!
I still have a thousand half-loves...
Oh, my God!
I want to shoot myself just thinking about it!
And you think I don't mean what I say?
Well, I mean every word I say!
I threw a small stone down
At the reflection of my image in the water
(I threw the stones down
At the reflection of my image in the water)
And it altogether disappeared
I burst as it shattered through me
Like a bullet through a bottle
And I'm expected to believe that any of this is realEmbed
