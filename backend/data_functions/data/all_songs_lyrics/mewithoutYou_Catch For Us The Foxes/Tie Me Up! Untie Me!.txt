Tie Me Up! Untie Me! LyricsI was looking at the leaves
Climbing to the tops of the trees
But you were nowhere to be found
Just beneath all the green
You were buried like a little seed
Among the roots and underground
I was licking at the leaves
But I was in short sleeves and you
You were like some sickness that I caught
And my sweetheart moved away
Swept off like garbage in the alleyway
And I need more grace than I thought
(Oh, please, brother, I'm far...
Brother, I'm far away...
Brother, I'm far away from everything
Oh, brother, I'm far...
Brother, I'm far away...
Brother! I'm far away from everything good!)
She's like a hot cloth on a fevered head
And like a needle she leads me (while I follow like thread)
Tie me up! Untie me!
All this wishing I was dead is getting old
It's gettin' old!
... it goes on, but it's old
I was swimming through the waves
For what must have been days
But could find no relief
When I started sinking down
I thought for certain I would drown
Until I saw you in the ocean
Underneath
All the bright colored fish tell
Of a treasure in a dull shell
"Such subtlety, so easily missed!"
You, my hidden pearl of pure and perfect love
And I'm the living example
Of 100% the opposite of this
(If I ask the same questions...
Well, yes, sir, I ask the same questions
Well, well maybe I repeat myself from time to time
But if I ask the same questions...
And then I know I ask the same questions
It's because everyone who answers me is a liar!)
She's like the hot cloth on a fevered head
And like a needle she leads me (while I follow like thread)
But you untied me... didn't You untie me, Lord?
And now I haven't even thought about killing myself
In almost five monthsEmbed
