Carousels Lyrics
On a bus ride into town
(Jesus remember me)
I wondered out loud
(When you come to Your Kingdom)
"Why am I going to town?"
As I looked around
(Jesus remember me)
At the billboards and the stores
(When you come)
And I thought, "Why do I look around?
(Jesus remember me)
And I kissed the filthy ground...
(When you come to Your Kingdom)
The first dry spot I found
(Jesus remember me)
I didn't have to wonder
(When you come)
Why I was laying down
Before long I was too cold...
Took a bus back to the station
I found a letter left by a pay phone
With no return contact
And it read like a horn blown by some sad angel
"Bunny, it was me...
It was me who let you down
It was the shyest attempt
I'd ever seen at conversation
But if I didn't have You as my guide
I'd still wander lost in Sinai
And counting the plates of cars from out-of-state
How I could jump in their path as they hurry along!
And You surround me
You’re pretty, but you’re are all I can see
Like a thick fog
If there was no way into God
I would never have laid in this grave of a body for so long

And St. Cyril's fair always came through
The first week of September
But it's already the 19th...
And there's no sign of it...
Yet I have a hard time
Remembering all the things I should remember
And a hard time
Forgetting all the things
That I was supposed to forget
And, Christ, when You're ready to come back
And I think I'm ready for You to come back;
But if You want to stay wherever exactly it is You are
That's okay, too... it's, it's really none of my business
And if I didn't have You as my guide
I'd still wander lost in Sinai
Or down by the tracks watching trains go by
To remind me: there are places that aren't here
And I had a well but all the water left
So I'll go ask Your forgiveness with every breath
If there was no way into God
I would never have laid in this grave of a body
So long, dear1Embed
