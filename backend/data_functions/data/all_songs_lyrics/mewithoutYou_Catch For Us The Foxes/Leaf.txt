Leaf LyricsIf you fail to see a problem
Which I find hard to believe
Or if you're hanging on from branches
Licking honey from the leaves;
You say, "The hopelessness of living...
And the childishness of suicide!"
But there's a call to love my brother
That can never be destroyed
However much you talk...
However well you talk
You make a certain sense
But still it's only stupid talk
However much I strut around...
However loud I sing
The shining One inside me won't say anything
Oh, to want one thing!
Oh, to want one thing!
(Oh, the purity of heart)
Oh, to want one thing!
Oh, to want one thing!
And you'll remind me how I said
You were a quiet bed in all my noise to rest...
Well, I was charming you at best
Can you remember, dear
My saying how my coming here was a terrible fall
As we crept like thieves along your bedroom hall?
I'd come down and touch your eyelids
But if you stay up too late
I'll throw you back into the cupboard
With all the chipped and dirty plates
Like the carnival game with the bottleneck and rubber ring...
Where even if you win
Even then you don't win
(All I want is to want one thing....)Embed
