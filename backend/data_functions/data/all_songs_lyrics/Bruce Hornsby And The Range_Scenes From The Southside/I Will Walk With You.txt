I Will Walk With You LyricsA strong man feels weak in the still heat of the day
Nothing is black and white, just a hazy gray
There's a long lonesome sound in the distance calling back to me
You look for some small reward
Everybody wants a little more
You could be the one at my door
Someone I might've seen before
What I come here for
Everything comes and goes
You try to believe but you never know
Anyway the wind blows
Somewhere, sometime
I will walk with you
Long way to go, the road winds on and on
You feel all alone, in the cold light of the dawn
And I know that it's warm by your side, but you're so far away
There's always another wall
Sometimes you feel so small
You could pick me up when I fall
Be the one to help me through it all
Be there when I call
Everything comes and goes
You try to believe but you never know
Anyway the wind blows
Somewhere, sometime
I will walk with you
There's always another wall
Sometimes you feel so small
You could pick me up when I fall
Be the one to help me through it all
Be there when I call
Everything comes and goes
You try to believe but you never know
Anyway the wind blows
Somewhere, sometime
I will walk with youEmbed
