Look Out Any Window Lyrics

There's a man working in a field
Sees the rain and it's burning
He's saying "This can't be real"
Oh, as he sees the color of the fields turning

Far away, the men too busy
Getting rich to care
Close their eyes
And let it all out into the air
Hoping nobody else would care

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
To see what's going on in the air around you

There's a man working on a boat
Pulling lines from the water
Just trying to stay afloat, oh
Filling the nets is getting harder
Far away, they bend the rules so secretly
Close their eyes
And let it all out into the sea
Hoping nobody else would see

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
To see what's going on in the air around you


Far away, too many leaders
Let them get their way
Close their eyes
And let it all out into the bay
Say they'll clear it up another day

Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
To see that's going on in the air around you
(Look out)
Look out for the big boys telling you
Everything they're gonna do
(Look out)
Look out for the fat cat builder man
Turning this into a waste land
(Look out)
Look out for the backroom boys
That say the smoke is gonna blow away
(Look out)
Look out for the men who say it's okay
Sitting in a building far awayEmbed
