The Show Goes On Lyrics

What's the long face, what's all the crying for
Didn't you expect it when you opened your door
To the man with the long coat, and the long list of victims
Everybody watching knows he's the one keeping score

From where she sits, everyone stands in judgment
People watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade

The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on
As the autumn's coming and the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

Some say she's alright, some say she'll never learn
Some rush into things, some stand and wait their turn
I've been here all along standing here all this time
But you never noticed, just let the same tired flames burn
From where I sits, everyone stands in judgment
And everybody watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade

The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on
As the autumn's coming and the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

Time is passing, slowly passing you by
You better try, try to find it before it passes you by
As I watch you walking to another cold dawn
And you keep on walking
And they keep on talking
Talking all along


From where she sits, everyone stands in judgment
Everybody watching as the curtain falls down
Oh, see the lights do a long slow fade
The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on
As the autumn's coming and the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

Oh, the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on
Oh-oh, oh, the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes onEmbed
