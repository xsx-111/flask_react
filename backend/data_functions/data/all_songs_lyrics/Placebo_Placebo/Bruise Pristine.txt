Bruise Pristine Lyrics
The means are ripe for taking, fade to grey
Trying to be ruthless in the face of beauty
In this matrix it's plain to see
It's either you or me

Bruise
Pristine
Serene
We were born to lose

Cast a line with a velvet glove
Reading like an open book, in the hands of love
In this matrix it's plain to see
It's either you or me

Bruise
Pristine
Serene
We were born to lose
Encore 
The means are right for taking, fade to grey
Trying to be ruthless in the face of beauty
In this matrix it's plain to see
It's either you or me

Bruise
Pristine
Serene
We were born to loseEmbed
