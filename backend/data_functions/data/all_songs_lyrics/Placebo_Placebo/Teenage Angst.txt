Teenage Angst Lyrics
Shine the headlight, straight into my eye
Like the roadkill, I'm paralyzed
You see through my disguise
At the drive-in, double feature
Pull the lever, break the fever
And say your last goodbye

Since I was born I started to decay
Now nothing ever-ever goes my way

One fluid gesture, like stepping back in time
Trapped in amber, petrified
And still not satisfied
Airs and social graces, elocution so divine
I'll stick to my needle, and my favorite waste of time
Both spineless and sublime

Since I was born I started to decay
Now nothing ever-ever goes my way6Embed
