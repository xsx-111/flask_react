Lady of the Flowers Lyrics
Excuse me, I apologize
He likes your attitude, he tries it on for size
He spends the afternoon, between your thighs
How's that for gratitude, I apologize

It seemed to last for hours
It seemed to last for days
This lady of the flowers
And her hypnotic gaze

Excuse me, I apologize
She's got vacuum cleaner eyes
Suck you in
She's got magazines, filled with pear pies
Excuse me, I apologize

It seemed to last for hours
It seemed to last for days
This lady of the flowers
And her hypnotic gaze

She wears her tears on her blouse
Confused and racked with self-doubt
She stole the keys to my house
And then she locked herself out
Excuse me, I apologize
He likes your attitude, he tries it on for size
He spends the afternoon, between your thighs
How's that for gratitude, I apologize

It seemed to last for hours
It seemed to last for days
This lady of the flowers
And her electronic haze

She wears her tears on her blouse
Confused and racked with self-doubt
She stole the keys to my house
And then she locked herself out
She stole the keys to my house
And then she locked herself out
She lays me down
She lays me1Embed
