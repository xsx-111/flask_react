Come Home Lyrics
Stuck between the do or die, I feel emaciated
Hard to breathe I try and try, I'll get asphyxiated
Swinging from the tallest height, with nothing left to hold on to

Every sky is blue, but not for me and you

Come home, come home, come home, come home

Glass of petrol vodka gin, it feels like breathing ethane
Throw yourself from skin to skin, and still it doesn't dull the pain
Vanish like a lipstick trace, it always blows me away

Every cloud is grey, with dreams of yesterday

Come home, come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home, come home

Always goes against the grain, and I can try and deny it
Give a monkey half a brain, and still he's bound to fry it
Now the happening scene is dead, I used to want to be there too
Every sky is blue, but not for me and you

Come home, come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home, come homeEmbed
