Wind Chimes Lyrics
Hanging down from my window those are my wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)
In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)

Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)
Now and then, a tear rolls off my cheek...

On a warm breeze the little bells, tink-a-lin wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)
Close your eyes and lean back, listen to wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)

It's so peaceful, close to a lullaby


The wind chimes, tink-a-lin
(Tink-a-lin, tink-a-lin, tink-a-lin)
The wind chimes, tink-a-lin
(Tink-a-lin, tink-a-lin, tink-a-lin)
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tink-a-lin
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tink-a-lin
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tink-a-lin1Embed
