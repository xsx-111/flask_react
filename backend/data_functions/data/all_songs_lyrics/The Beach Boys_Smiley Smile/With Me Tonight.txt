On and on she go dum bee-doo-da
On and on she go dum bee-doo
On and on she go dum bee-doo-da
On and on she go dum bee-doo
On and on she go dum bee-doo-da
On and on she go dum bee-doo
("Good!")
On and on you go dum bee-doo-da
On and on you go dum bee-doo

With me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
You're with me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
For sure you're with me tonight, I'm sure you're with me tonight

On and on you go dum bee-doo-da
On and on you go dum bee-doo

With me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
With me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
For sure you're with me tonight, I know you're with me tonight
On and on you go dum bee-doo-da
On and on you go dum bee-doo
On and on you go dum bee-doo-da
On and on you go dum bee-doo

With me tonight I know...Embed
