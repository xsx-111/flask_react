Solitaire Lyrics
Don't wanna talk anymore
I'm obsessed with silence
I go home and I lock my door
I can hear the sirens
I see buildings and bars from the window
And I listen to the wind blow
I see people and cars covered in gold
And I'm happy to be on my own

Hard like a rock, cold like stone
White like a diamond, black like coal
Cut like a jewel, yeah I repair myself
When you're not there

Solitaire
Something you consider rare
I don't wanna be compared, yeah
With that cheap shimmer and glitter
Solitaire

I'm in love with the ice-blue grey skies of England
I'll admit all I wanna do is get drunk and silent
Watch my life unfold all around me
Like a beautiful garden
I see flowers so tall, they surround me
Oh, my heart, it became so hardened
Hard like a rock, cold like stone
White like a diamond, black like coal
Cut like a jewel, yeah I repair myself
When you're not there

Solitaire
Something you consider rare
I don't wanna be compared, yeah
With that cheap shimmer and glitter
Solitaire

And all the other jewels around me
They astounded me at first
I covered up my heart in boundaries
And all the fakes they called me cursed
But I'm not cursed, I'm not cursed
I was just covered in dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt

Solitaire
Something you consider rare
I don't wanna be compared, yeah
With that cheap shimmer and glitter
Solitaire
Hmm, solitaire
Hmm, solitaire
Hmm, solitaire
Hmm, solitaire37Embed
