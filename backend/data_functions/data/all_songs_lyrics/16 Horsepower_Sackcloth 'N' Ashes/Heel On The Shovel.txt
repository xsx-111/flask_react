Heel On The Shovel LyricsI'm diggin' you a shallow grave
An to the sun your face i'll raise
I'm diggin' you a shallow grave
One hundred buzzards buzzin'
I seen death hangin' from the tallest tree
Eyes closed no lookin' back at me
Ye they came an took him in the night
The one who kissed em was greed
O everyone will see
An everyone will know
Boy you reap what you sow
I'm diggin' you a shallow grave
An on your rotten bones i'll raise
Yellow daisies
For my true loves hair
One hundred buzzards buzzin'
I see death runnin' from his majesty
O lord where is the fear in me
In between your praying hands
You hold the skeleton keyEmbed
