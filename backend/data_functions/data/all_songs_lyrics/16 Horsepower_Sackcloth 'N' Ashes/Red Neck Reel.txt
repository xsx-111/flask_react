Red Neck Reel LyricsEverybody knows my business in this town
Lips are loose the whole way 'round
Where I go I leave a trail
Hell to heaven don't never fail
Hell to heaven don't never fail
Everybody knows my movement in this town
I chase my tail, yea I'm a fuckin' clown
But to you I dare not speak
My words to you would be worthless an weak
My words to you would be worthless an weak an all
But don't you take no pleasure
I ain't yet kicked the pail
I guess I see you boys later
I saw you see me when I'm down
An my guilty head you we're aimin'
See me in your eyes an I am dead
See me in your eyes an I am dead
But don't you take no pleasure
I ain't yet kicked the pailEmbed
