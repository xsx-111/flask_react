Ruthie Lingle Lyrics
Blue Ruthie Lingle, take me home
Sad-eyed Suzanna, take me home
The curse of those red lips all on me
Goddess Samantha, take me home

Black-eyed Rebecca, take me home
Here, buxom Gretta, take me home
Legs, thighs, and navel, you're the only one
Leah Samantha, take me home

Meek mother Mary, take me home
Sweet sister Sarah, take me home
Underneath the floorboards, down here eating dirt
Seduce me, Samantha, take me homeEmbed
