I Seen What I Saw LyricsI seen ya in your red room laughin'
With your shinin' coffee can
So many wrongs all kinds a goins on
Held my head an ran
But I hid and did a bit more lookin'
Saw ya dancin' on the pine porch creakin'
Mouth open an doors down wide
Here's what was inside
I seen what I saw
An these things I do are wrong, that's all
An these tales I tales I tell are tall
Then I climbed up on the big horse strappin'
Put the spur down to blood
He took off 16 horses strong
Left me lyin' in mud
An there I sit until the sun's up shinin'
Yes an black stands my ride
Twenty hands high
An watchin' spookeyed
My hands on his side1Embed
