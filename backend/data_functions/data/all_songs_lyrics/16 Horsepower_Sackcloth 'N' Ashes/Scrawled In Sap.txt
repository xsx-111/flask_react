Scrawled In Sap LyricsO the sky grey orange
An the walls stained blue
An i laid right down on the golden satin with you
Into sween dark circles of beautiful eyes
I go round
O lord
I go round
Will you tell me once again
Cream white skin
You are my friend
I seen you walkin' and your white hips sway
O girl i will have you no more
To the moan in your voice
Not a charm do you lack
Your skin to touch as a black ravens back
But i cannot go far with these words as they rhyme
As to tell, of the pleasure, your hand in mine
An i pray as i say this song in this way
That your eyes they would close an your head begin to sway
An you'll feel how he heals with his blood on our skin
I am yours lady scrawled an thin
Will you tell me once again
Cream white skin
You are my friend
I seen you walkin' in your husband's way
Girl i will have you moreEmbed
