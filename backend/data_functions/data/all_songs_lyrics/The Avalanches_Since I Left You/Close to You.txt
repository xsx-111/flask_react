Close to You Lyrics
He-here I come, he got -come
He-here I come, he got -come
He-here I come, he got -come
Did somebody somewhere summon me?
He-here I come, he got -come
He-here I come, he got -come
He-here I come, he got -come

Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you
Close to you

The disco
The disco
The disco
Glass got me right
Glass got me right
Stop to the midnight -don't stop
Stop to the disco, the disco, the disco
Stop to the midnight
Don't stop to the midnight
Don't stop to the midnight
Glass got me right
On to the disco

There's a gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Turnin' the joint, upside down

On to the disco, disco, disco
Stop to the midnight
The midnight
The midnight
The midnight
The midnight
The midnight
On to the disco, disco, disco
Stop to the midnight
On to the disco
Stop to the midnight
On to the disco
Stop to the midnight, stop
On to the disco, disco, disco
On to the disco
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
On to the disco, disco, disco
Disco, disco
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside down
Gentleman that's goin' round
Turnin' the joint, upside downEmbed
