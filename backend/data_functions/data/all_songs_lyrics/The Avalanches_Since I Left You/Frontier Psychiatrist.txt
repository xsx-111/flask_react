Frontier Psychiatrist Lyrics
"Is Dexter ill? Is Dexter ill? Is Dexter ill? Is Dexter ill today?"
"No, Mr. Kirk, Dexter's in school."
"I'm afraid he's not, Miss Fishpaw. Dexter's truancy problem is way out of hand. The Baltimore County School Board have decided to expel Dexter from the entire public school system."
"Oh, Mr. Kirk, I'm as upset as you to learn of Dexter's truancy, but surely expulsion is not the answer!"
"I'm afraid expulsion is the only answer! It's the opinion of the entire staff that Dexter is criminally insane, sane, sane, sane"
That boy needs therapy
Psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch, what does that mean?
You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Rannygazoo, let's have a tune
Now when I count three
That, that, that, that, that boy, boy needs therapy
He was-he was white as a sheet
And he also made false teeth

Avalanche is above, business continues below
Did I ever tell you the story about
Cowboys, and m-midgets, and the Indians and fron-frontier psychiatrist?
I-I felt strangely hypnotised
I was in another world, a world of 20,000 girls
And milk and rectangles
To an optometrist!
The man with the golden eyeball
And tighten your buttocks, pour juice on your chin
I promise my girlfriend I'd (play) the violin, violin, violin
Frontier psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier psychiatrist
Frontier, frontier, frontier, frontier psychiatrist

That boy needs therapy
Psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Purely psychosomatic
That boy needs therapy
Lie down on the couch, what does that mean?
You're a nut! You're crazy in the coconut!
What does that mean? That boy needs therapy
I'm gonna kill you, that boy needs therapy
Rannygazoo, let's have a tune
Now when I count three
That, that, that, that, that boy, boy needs therapy
He was-he was white as a sheet
And he also made false teeth

Can you think of anything else that talks oth-other than a person?
A-a-a bird? Yeah
Sometimes a parrot talks
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Yes, some birds are funny when they talk
Can you think of anything else?
Um, a record, record, record, record?10Embed
