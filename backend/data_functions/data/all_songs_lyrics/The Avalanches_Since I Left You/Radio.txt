Radio Lyrics
Johnny, Johnny! Open up
Johnny, it's Frank! Open up
Look you've been in there for three weeks
Now come on, open up
Johnny, Johnny!
Out of my way, I'm watching television
Are you crazy? That's the test pattern
I like it!
Well, there are two things to be done
First of all, we put him in the hospital
And withdraw all television, I see
And then, we give him this... radio
Radio, radio, radio, radio, radio, radio...

Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals

Sometimes you don't understand
Is it as good, understand
Sometimes you don't understand
Is it as good, understand
Sometimes you don't understand
Is it as good, understand
Sometimes you don't understand
Is it as good, understand
Sometimes you don't understand
Is it as good, understand
Sometimes you don't understand
Is it as good, understand
Sometimes you don't understand
Is it as good, understand
Sometimes you don't understand
Is it as good, understand

Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sometimes you don't understand
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
(Is it as good, understand)
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sometimes you don't understand
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
Sending those signals, sending those signals
Sending those signals, those digital signals
(Is it as good, understand)
Oh, can't you hear it?
Can't you hear it?
Oh, can't you hear it? (Is it as good, understand)
Can't you hear it?
Oh, can't you hear it?
Oh, can't you hear it?
Oh-Embed
