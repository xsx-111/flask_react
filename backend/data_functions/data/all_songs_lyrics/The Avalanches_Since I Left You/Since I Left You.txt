Since I Left You LyricsWatch the steps
Get a drink, have a good time now
Welcome to paradise, paradise, paradise...
Since I left you
I found the world so new
Since I left you
I found the world so new
I found the world so new...
Since I left you
I found the world so new

Since I left you
I found the world so new
E-Everyday
Since I left you
I found the world so new...
