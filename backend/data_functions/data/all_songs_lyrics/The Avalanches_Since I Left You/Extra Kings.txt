Extra Kings Lyrics
J'ai, j'ai froid, j'ai froid, froid
Chaud, j'ai froid, um-um
Oh-oh

J'ai, j'ai, j'ai froid, froid

Ever since the day I left you

I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left you
I'm trying, but I just can't get you
Ever since the day I left youEmbed
