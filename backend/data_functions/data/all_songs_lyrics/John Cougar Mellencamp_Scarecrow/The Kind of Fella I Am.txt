The Kind of Fella I Am Lyrics
Well I don't like it when I see your eyes dartin'
Back and forth across the room
And I don't like it when I see you doin' dances
Baby that I ain't used to

But that's the kind of fella I am
That's the kind of fella I am
I'm a jealous kinda fella
And I might fall in love with you
I'm a jealous kinda fella
And I just might fall in love with you
Hey

Well I don't like it when you try to impress me
With your daddy's jewels and his car
And I don't like it when I hear you talkin'
'Bout your ex-boyfriend the movie star

But what I like is when I walk you home
And you let me hold you tight
But I don't like it when I hear that you learned
All this from some other guy
But that's the kind of fella I am
That's the kind of fella I am
I'm a jealous kinda fella
And I might fall in love with you, yeah yeah yeah
I'm a jealous kinda fella
I might fall in love with you
So look out


That's the kind of fella I am
That's the kind of fella I am
I'm a jealous kinda fella
And I might fall in love with you, yeah yeah yeah
I'm a jealous kinda fella
I got my eye on you
Well that's the kind of fella I am
That's the kind of fella I am
I'm a jealous kinda fella
And I I got my eye on you, yeah yeah yeah
I'm a jealous kinda fella
And I I got my eye on you, yeah yeah yeahEmbed
