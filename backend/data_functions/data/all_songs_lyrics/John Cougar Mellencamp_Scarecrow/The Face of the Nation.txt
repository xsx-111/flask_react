The Face of the Nation Lyrics
As I run through this life
Sometimes it breaks my heart
Seein' old people goin' downtown
Stumblin' their way through the dark
And the little babies cry
For their mothers' warmth
Sometimes I feel so helpless
I don't know where to start

And the face of the nation
Keeps changin' and changin'
The face of the nation
I don't recognize it no more
The face of the nation
The face of the nation

So many lonely people
Damn those broken dreams
Yes I know it could be better
You say that about anything
Some got it worse than me (Oh)
Some got it worse than you
See the people starvin' underneath the tree (Oh)
You wonder what happened to the golden rule
And the face of the nation
Keeps changin' and changin'
The face of the nation
I don't recognize it no more
The face of the nation
Yeah the face of the nation

You know babe I'm gonna keep on tryin'
To put things right
If only for me and you
'Cause the devil sleeps tonight

And the face of the nation
Keeps changin' and changin'
The face of the nation
I don't recognize it no more
And the face of the nation
Keeps changin' and changin'
The face of the nation
I don't recognize it no more
The face of the nation (Oh)
Hey the face of the nation
Face of the nation (Oh)
Hey the face of the nation
Face of the nation (Oh)
Hey the face of the nation
Face of the nation (Oh)
Face of the nation
Face of the nation (Oh)
Hey the face of the nationEmbed
