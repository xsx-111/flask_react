Honest I Do LyricsDon’t you know that I love you?
Honest, I do (oh, honest, I do)
I’d never placed no one above you
Please tell me you love me (tell me you love me)
Stop drivin’ me mad
'Cause you’re the sweetest and the best thing baby (sweetest and the best thing, yeah)
That I’ve ever had
Oh, don’t you know that I love you? (you know that I love)
Honest, baby, I do
And I’d never place no one above you, no
Ooh-ooh
Hmm-hmm
Oh, you know I love you, baby
Honest, I do (honest, I do)
And I’d never place, oh-oh
No one above you, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know that I love you, baby, love you, baby (love you, baby)
Honest, I do (oh, honest, I do)
And you know that I’d never place no one above you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, babyEmbed
