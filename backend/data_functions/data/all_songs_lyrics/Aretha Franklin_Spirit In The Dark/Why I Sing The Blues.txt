Why I Sing The Blues Lyrics
Everybody wants to know, they ask me why I sing the blues
Everybody wants to know now, why I keep crying the blues
Well, I’ve been around little while
And I’ve paid some dues, yes, I have
People laying in ghetto flats, cold and numb
Looking at roaches, telling bedbugs to move over and give ‘em some
Oh, it’s hot in here, that’s one reason I’m singing the blues, yeah
Been around a long time
God knows I’ve paid a few dues, yes, I have

Stood in line at the County Hall
Heard a man say: “We’re gonna build some high rises for y’all
Up in renewal, work on a removal, talk to me, yeah”
Don’t feel bad about it, just trying to be free

I don’t want my kids growing up to be no fools
You keep rapping to me y’all ain’t got no room in school, yeah
And you want to know why I’m singing the blues, yeah
Been around a little while
And I’ve seen some people paying dues, yes, I have

Some of my friends told me I was born to lose
But when I looked around they were singing the same old kind of blues, now
And you want to know why I’m singing ‘em this evening, yeah
Don’t be saying those, everybody pays some dues sometimes
Yeah, sing the blues nowEmbed
