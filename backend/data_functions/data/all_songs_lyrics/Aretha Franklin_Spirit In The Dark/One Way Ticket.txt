One Way Ticket Lyrics
I remember you’ve forgotten to remember
I wonder why
Baby, it was just a (One way ticket to love)
Ticket to love (One way ticket), mmm

You were lonely without a friend
That was when our romance began
Baby, it was just a, just a (One way ticket to love)
Ticket to love (One way ticket), ooh

Like the dew on the mountain
Like the foam way out on the sea
Like the bubbles on the fountain
You’re gone forever from me, yeah

I loved you kindly, I loved you so blindly
But I loved you honest and I loved you true
But maybe, baby, it was just a (One way ticket to love)
Ticket to love (One way ticket), ooh

Like the dew on the mountain
Like the foam way out out on the sea
Like the bubbles on the fountain
You’re gone forever from me, baby, don’t do it
I loved you kindly, but I loved you so blindly
But I loved you honest and everybody knows I loved you true
Maybe, baby, maybe it was just a (One way ticket to love)
Grab about, release this (One way ticket), yeah

(One way ticket to love, oh oh
One way ticket to love) Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh)
(One way ticket to love) Oh (Oh oh oh)Embed
