When the Battle is Over Lyrics
One more time you hurt me
You thought you you had your victory
One more reason for you to worry
Cause you got the best of me
You should never count your chickens
Before you eggs get hatched
I believe it, mm, to my soul
You finally met your match
Tell me now

When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
Who it will be
Who it will be
Will it be you
Will it be me

Tell me now: who will wear the crown, yeah yeah
Ever time i kiss ya
I feel I get the upper hand
I want you ooo to surrender
And tell me ya going be my man
A slip of the lip has been known to sink a ship
And i believe I believe I believe to my soul
I finally got a winner's slip
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
Who it will be
Who it will be
Will it be you
Will it be me

Yeah, tell me now: who will wear the crown
When this battle is over?
Who be wearing this crown
When this battle is over?
Oh, when it's over children
When this battle is over
Yeaaah when it's overEmbed
