Lisbon LyricsThe countless eyes dotted in the night sky
I speak the language, or several hundred words
A cloudless day, and a thunderous night
Among companions, I'll carry my name
But the life we lead came gradually
Who keeps the time?
A bitter lime, will do us fine
To kill the taste
We'll turn deaf ears on all that we don’t wanna hear
But a cause for travel has come again
At this early hour, I'll tell your wife a story
She looks outside and doubles over laughing
Of the souls you loved, and a place you lived
Those country houses
And a change of heart tore us apart
Oh, what a ride
Every chance you have
All the love and life
All the joy and grace
Don't be absurd, don't you think it out
You know what thinking does
To love's shine, and love's light
Now it's your every word
Oh I'm hanging on
It feels right these days
I saw strange things
The lines of old faces
Up on the stormy sky, tonight
Now all the younger kids have gone away to sleep
In the days to come, I’ll do the same
At this early hour, I'll tell your wife a story
She looks outside and doubles over laughing
The life we lead came gradually
Who keeps the time?
Bitter lime, do us fine
To kill the tasteEmbed
