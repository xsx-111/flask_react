All My Great Designs LyricsI've been hearing things
Voices carry over the water
Things I can't deny
Night after night
Night after night
Night
A broken heart
You will know where
You've been running around
You will know where
You've been out on your own
It will haunt you
Night after night
Will haunt you
Night after night
And I've been seeing things
Lights are shining through my eyelids
All my great designs
Never make out of my sleep
You will know where
You've been running around
You will know when
You've been out on your own
It will haunt you
Night after night
You get high
But you know
Night after nightEmbed
