Torch Song LyricsIf I had known the graceful song I should know
To slow down all the madness, I would have sung
A whispered melody to calm you and keep you close
But I don't know the tune
It's a burden on my sorry soul
No, I don't have a clue
It's a weight upon my empty skull
If I was soundly sleeping, I'd fall into dreams
But the night time's stale and restless, it's all wrong for me
The night time's stale and restless, it's all wrong for me
I don't know the tune
It's a burden on my sorry soul
No I don't have a clue
A weight upon my empty skullEmbed
