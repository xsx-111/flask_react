Angela Surf City LyricsAngela holds a grudge over nothing
Angela, what’s the difference?
Today’s a day like any other
Still the flag snaps in the wind
Still your name rings true
You took the high road
I couldn’t find you up there
You kept your jaw wired closed
I never noticed before
I used to see the signs
Now I dream of the time
I was holding on to you
For a lack of anything to do
Still the white caps roll away
Still your name rings true
Mine is yours, yours is yours
Life goes on, life goes on all around you
Let’s go home happy again
Just take your head from your hands
Take up the cause just once more
I never noticed before
I used to see the signs
Now I dream of the time
I was holding on to you
For a lack of anything to do
Back to school
Back to work
Can this go on forever?
Angela, what’s the difference?
Life goes on all around youEmbed
