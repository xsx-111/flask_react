Woe Is Me LyricsThere's a girl that you should know
She was mine not so long ago
Had my number and we fell in love
She put me under and I got lost
Lost my nerve and I lost my head
Just about everything I had
Washed out in a windy sea
Couldn't see my hand in front of me
Woe is me
Woe is me
Hey, do you wanna walk with me
By the trees and the factories
Hey, do you wanna hop the fence
In the sleepy red sunset
There's a girl that you should know
She was mine not so long ago
Had my number and we fell in love
She put me under and I got lost
Woe is me
Woe is me
Woe is me
Woe is me
Now the street light bright and pale
As we sip our ginger ale
I kiss you by the blinking sign
Don't get heavy, let's be light
On and on
Our merry way
On and on
Our merry way
On and on
Our merry way
On and on
Our merry wayEmbed
