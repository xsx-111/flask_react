Blue as Your Blood LyricsI'd give you all my love...
I'd give you all my love...
But my heart itself is broken...
How many nights must lumber by...
I sit alone and I wonder why...
Oh, hazy, lazy days...
I could dream of you forever...
Under the shade of a juniper tree...
I sing a sad song of you and me...
The sky above...
The sky above...
Is blue as your blood...
Black is the color of your eyelash...
Spanish is the language of your tongue...
Life rolled us over like a town car...
Bruised up and busted to the ground...
The Lord came down and said to me...
"Throw off your worries and be at peace..."
The sky above...
The sky above...
Is blue as your blood...
In a hazy, lazy daydream...Embed
