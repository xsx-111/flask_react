While I Shovel the Snow LyricsWell they say, "Can't please everyone"
But I'm stuck on a winning streak
Well today, there's clarity
And tonight, I see tomorrow
All at once, the winter's here
All the lochs are frozen over
As I look in back of me
See a shape beside the walkway
Half of my life, I've been watching
Half of my life, I've been waking up
Birds in the sky could warn me
There's no life like the slow life
So for now, I'll take my time
For now, I can't be bothered
But I learned a lot of things
And I fudged a lot of numbers
Once again, the winter's here
All the lochs are frozen over
So I look in back of me
See a shape beside the walkway
Half of my life, I've been watching
Half of my life, I've been waking up
Birds in the sky could warn me
There's no life like the slow lifeEmbed
