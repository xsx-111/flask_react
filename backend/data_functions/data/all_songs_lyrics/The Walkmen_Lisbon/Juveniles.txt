Juveniles LyricsYou're with someone else
Tomorrow night
Doesn't matter to me
Cause there's a sun dying
Into the hill
You got all I need
You pulled a blanket across my eyes
It's a tragedy
Take a lonely look, for my sake
It's a tragedy
Oh country air
Is good for me
No matter whose side I'm on
Let these dead leaves
Dry in the sun
I'll be up and gone
There's a stranger outside
Oh Lord!
He's a wiser man than I
Oh Lord
I am a good man
By any count
And I see better things to come
Could she be right?
When she repeats
I am the lucky one
You're one of us
Or one of them
You're one of us
Or one of them
You're one of us
Or one of them
You're one of us
Or one of them
You're one of us
Or one of themEmbed
