Stranded LyricsThrow another dime in me my friend
And I'll sing a song I know for thee
You don't want me
You can tell me
I'm the bigger man here
Oh it's true
You're all prettier now
Than the last time
But the words aren't coming through
And I'm stranded and I'm starry-eyed
Oh why, won't you wash out of me
There's broken glass all around my feet
Laid my plans so carelessly
What's the story
With my old friends
Drunk and lonely
To a man
How I love 'em all
As the days slip by
And they're all following my lead
Oh why, does the rain fall o'er
When I'm stranded and I'm starry-eyedEmbed
