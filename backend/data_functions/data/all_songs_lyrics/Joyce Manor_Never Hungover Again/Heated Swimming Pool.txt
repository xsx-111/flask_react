Heated Swimming Pool Lyrics
Don't you remember how the change is?
It's not as easy as the same is
I wish you would have died in high school
So you could be somebody's idol

But you were clever
Always, forever, in command
It's my house, my rules
My heated swimming pool

And I don't even have to wait for
You to open up their cages
'Cause I can see them in the Ivy
And I can tell that they don't like me

But "never better"
Read the letters on your hands
As you lay next to me
By the heated swimming pool1Embed
