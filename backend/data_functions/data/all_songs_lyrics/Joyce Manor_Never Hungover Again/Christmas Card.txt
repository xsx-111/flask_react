Christmas Card Lyrics
Looking at your face in the dark
You don't even look that smart
Could never make it past that part
And now I guess we never will
Looking for the keys to the truck
Your body's saying isn't that enough?
Your brain is going I don't give a fuck

You treat it like a game of skill
But it's more like a work of art
Or money in a Christmas card
You think about it way too hard
I'm gonna stay with you until
You disappear into the crowd
I don't know what you tried to tell me
You know I think about it still

Looking at your face in the dark
You don't even look that smart
I don't know what you tried to tell me
Disappear into the crowd
I don't know what you tried to tell me
You know I think about it stillEmbed
