Schley Lyrics
So watch out, you're in danger
You'd never know it but you know that it's possible
Like your name, the way it looks
Carved into the cover of a telephone book
I don't care, I'm never gonna
It sounds better when you're high on marijuana
Yeah, right, in my head
Yeah, right, am I right in my head?

So watch out, you're in danger
You'd never know it but you know that it's possible
Like old friends who'd never ask
"How can you be happy when you wear all black?"
And they care because they wanna
It feels weird, like a really weird movie
All night, in my head
All night, in my head

So watch out, you're in danger
You'd never know it, but you know that it's possible
Schley, Schley
