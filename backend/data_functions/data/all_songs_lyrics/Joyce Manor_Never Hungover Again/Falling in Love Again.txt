Falling in Love Again Lyrics
Thanks for showing me around last night
Hope you don't think I don't care
Because I do, I just don't know if I
Should feel this bad about you
After finishing your birthday drugs
Look at a yearbook unprepared
And betray yourself to sleep it off
Then come down to collect it

I think you're funny
I like your friends
I like the way they treat you
I've got some money
That we could spend
Not that you're like that
I'm falling in love again

Thanks for showing me around last night
Hope you don't think I don't care
Because I do, I just don't know if I
Should feel this bad about you
After finishing your birthday drugs
Look at a yearbook unprepared
And betray yourself to sleep it off
Then come down to collect it
Then come down to collect it
Then come down to collect it
Then come down to collect it
Then come down to collect it
Then come down to collect it3Embed
