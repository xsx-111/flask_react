The Jerk Lyrics
The sand, your shoes, your point of view
Erase your face in a dumb cartoon
Well I saw "The Jerk," but that stuff don't work
You say it used to
Well, can you say it with a "please?"

I wanna see what's going on
Over your shoulder, but it all goes wrong
Don't say goodbye, say you're not sure—
Anything could ever come between the two of us
And I would say the same thing

In the place with cakes and eightball juice
Where I lost my place
So I started over again with some farmyard friends
Looked em dead in the eyes
And said, "I'm not like you"

I wanna see what's going on
Over your shoulder, but it all goes wrong
Don't say goodbye, say you're not sure—
Anything could ever come between the two of us
And I would say the same thing
I wanna see what's going on
Over your shoulder, but it all goes wrong
It all goes wrongEmbed
