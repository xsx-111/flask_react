Victoria Lyrics
Had such a bad time hanging out
Regret the choices that I made
I know it doesn't matter now
Won't be the one who walks away

Victoria
You've got me hanging on again
Victoria

Had such a hard time saying no
Locked myself out and had to climb
Over the back wall and scraped my arm
It bled a little, but I'm fine

Victoria
You've got me hanging on again
Victoria

Took the screen door off the frame
Washed the blood off of my arm
And watched it circle down the drain
Put the screen door back in place
Now I'm alone again
Victoria
You've got me hanging on again
