Catalina Fight Song Lyrics
Sunken city by the ocean
You could teach the seventh grade
Do you think because you chose to?

You always
Fell in love the way you're supposed to
At the Target inside of the mall
Fear of what you weren't exposed to
There's no way
To keep in touch with certain people
You wonder how long something can last
Pretty sure most people don't think about that
But who the fuck's laughing now?

Sunken city by the ocean
Car smells like hot Gatorade
Do you think because you chose to?
Do you think things are different than you think they are?
Never really had a drug phase
So you think you're fucking miserable now?
For the Catalina fight song
You, always3Embed
