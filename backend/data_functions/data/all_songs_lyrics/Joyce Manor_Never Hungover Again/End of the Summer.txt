End of the Summer LyricsCase closed, that's fine
Everybody's going to
Your house, inside
Never thought about that
Like I'm supposed to
In the blacklight
At the end of the summer
It's too sad
Blue marker on a paper bag
You could wear it like a mask
You could be your own dad
Like you're supposed to
I could show you
At the end of the summer
I start to feel it fade away
There's nothing I can do
At the end of the summer
Try to imagine there's a way
For me and you
At the end of the summer
Case closed, that's fine
Everybody's going to
Your house, inside
Never thought about that
Like I'm supposed to
In the blacklight
At the end of the summer2Embed
