In the Army Now Lyrics
Here we are in the army now
Sunflower on a place matâ€”that one's yours
Look good in the photograph
'Cause we're in the army now
Where were you when you felt left out?
It's all shit for families anyway
Look good in the uniform
Look good holding a gun

Furniture store
Shards of glass
I wanna kiss you through your hockey mask
'Cause we're in the army now

In the army now
I always knew you'd leave me someday
I always knew you'd have to go
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, oh
I always knew you'd join the army
In the army now
I always knew you'd leave me someday
I always knew you'd have to go
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, oh
I always knew you'd join the armyEmbed
