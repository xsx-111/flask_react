Casanova LyricsIt's 11 o'clock and the last time that we talked
He said he's busy and he'd call me but he never called me back (no)
And now I feel like somethings going on
But I feel crazy every time I bring it up so I don't
He told me there's no one above me
And all my friends are telling me different and something seems funny
Tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
I can still hear voices in my head like

I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on ya
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Coz he's playing a part

Why didn't I see it from the start
How was I to know
It would bruise my heart
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
Like a wave you took me under now it's so hard to breath
 (Justin Timberlake)
And I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know hey)
Verse 2:
I shoulda never given into his games
Shoulda only been the type that treat me the same
And it ain't fair coz I gave him all I had now there's nothing left
(these tears wil dry and you'll move on, on and on and on)
This songs the same thing
Can't keep fallin'
No more heartbreak
Tell me do you know what's the point of being in love, love, love
Coz I still hear everybody's voice like

I'm tryna tell you little sister
He's running around on you
Like some Casanova lover
At the expense of your heart
You need to listen to your big brother
I'm just tryna look out for ya
You need to find another
Coz he's playing a part
Why didn't I see it from the start
How was I to know
It would bruise my heart
So fast it had me blind-sighted I couldn't see
Like a wave you took me under now it's so hard to breath
 (Justin Timberlake)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know, hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes you never know, hey)
And so I cry cry cry
Ask myself why why why
And that I cry cry cry
So why should I try try try
And so I cry cry cry (hey)
Ask myself why why why (sometimes it has to be this way)
And that I cry cry cry (hey)
So why should I try try try
And I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just to young to play with love (sometimes you never know, hey)
I guess I'm just too young to play with love (hey)
Guess I'm just too young to play with love (sometimes it has to be this way)
I guess I'm just too good to play with love (hey)
I guess I'm just to young to play with love (sometimes you never know, hey)Embed
