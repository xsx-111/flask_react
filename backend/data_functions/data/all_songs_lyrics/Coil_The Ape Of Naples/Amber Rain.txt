Amber Rain Lyrics
Amber rain is beautiful but wrong
Caught between weak and being strong
It seems these days the weaker ones survive
What an awful way to find out you're alive

A dull warm red water falls
Flowing down to the sea
Where deeper darker waters wait for me

I don't expect I'll ever understand
How life just trickled through my hand8Embed
