Tattooed Man Lyrics
There's a man lying down in a grave somewhere
With the same tattoos as me
And I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
There's a man lying down in a bed somewhere
With a different set of sex aspects
And I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, my eyes

This is me here now pining like a dog
Whining like a dog in a thick harbour fog
Waiting for a ship that will make him sick
And when the ship comes, big trouble, his trouble will begin
And the church bells chime the colour of wine
And the angels devil fight to snatch back the lost time

And there's a man lying down with a blade somewhere
With the same taboos as me
And I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
There's a man lying down in a bed somewhere
With a different set of sex aspects
And I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, my eyes
This is the dark age of love, this is the dark age of love
This is the dark age of love, this is the dark
And I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
There's a man laying down
There's a man laying down
There's a man laying down
There's a man laying down somewhere3Embed
