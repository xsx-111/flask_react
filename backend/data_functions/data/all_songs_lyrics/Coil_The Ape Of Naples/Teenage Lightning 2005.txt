Teenage Lightning 2005 Lyrics
Don't be alarmed, it will not harm you
It's only lightning, teenage lightning
Don't be afraid don't be expectant
Don't be afraid don't be reluctant
Don't be afraid
It's only lightning, teenage lightning
It will not harm you don't be afraid
It will not harm you it's only lightning
Teenage lightning it's real, it's unbelievably real
It will not harm you it's only lightning
It's only lightning, teenage lightning
