Going Up Lyrics
Are you ready to go now?
Are you ready to go now?
Are you ready to go now?
Are you ready to go now?

Ground floor: perfumery
Stationery and leather goods
Wigs and haberdashery
Kitchenware and foods

Going up
Going up

First floor: telephones
Gents' ready-made suits
Shirts, socks, ties
Hats, underwear and shoes

Going up
Going up
Second floor: carpets
Travel goods and beddings
Materials and soft furnishing
Restaurant and teas

Up
Going up
Going up
Going up
Going up
Going up
Going up
Going up

It just is
It just is
It just is
It just is3Embed
