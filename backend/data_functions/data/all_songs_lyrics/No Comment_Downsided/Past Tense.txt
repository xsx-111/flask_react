Past Tense LyricsA lifetime spent standing still
Like dead flies gathering on a window sill
A sibling disgrace who believes to be
The broken limb in the family tree
Past tense!
Too late to save, pulse stand still
A dry-lunged solo death rattle
Regret in a tear-filled trance
A never forgotten remembrance
Past tense!Embed
