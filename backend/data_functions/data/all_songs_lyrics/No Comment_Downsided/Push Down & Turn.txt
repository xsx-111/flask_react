Push Down & Turn LyricsConfined within my bedroom cell
Here by choice outside is Hell
Isolated to myself
I hurt inside but i'll never tell
More than just a passing phase
Living on self-numbered days
Masquerading my inner rage
This is my Pattern of change
Try after try, i'll never learn
There's only one way out!Embed
