Hacked to Chunks LyricsEducation promised a helpful head start
Now home sweet home is a shopping cart
"Tomorrow Never Knows", penned a Beatle
Later shot dead, "Imagine all the people"
The radio weeps the 12-bar blues
Television breaks the daily news
Life's the word we're told to choose
Time stands still win or lose
Education promised a helpful head start
Now home sweet home is a shopping cart
"Tomorrow Never Knows", penned a Beatle
Later shot dead, "Imagine all the people"
The radio weeps the 12-bar blues
Television breaks the daily news
Life's the word we're told to choose
Time stands still win or lose
Living on time
Known as borrowed
Here today
Gone tomorrowEmbed
