Lament LyricsSuch a struggle to overcome
The grip of self-destruction
Mind-tied worse than confused
Emotionally scarred
From the heat of hate
I contemplate my expiration date
Mind-tied worse than confused now!
Such a struggle to reason why
To convey the problems on my mind
Mind-tied worse then confused
To scratch the surface of escape
At a loss for words I can't relate
Mind-tied worse than confused now!
Losing words I chooseEmbed
