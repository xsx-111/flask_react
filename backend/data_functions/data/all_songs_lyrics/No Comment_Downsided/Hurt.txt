Hurt LyricsProblems they persist!
Hard times shatter windows with fists
Yet still the problems they persist
Hard times carve open wrists
Yet still the problems they persist
Hard times shout, curse and spit
Yet still the problems they persist
Hard times cloud eyes with mist
Yet still the problems they persist
Problems they persist!Embed
