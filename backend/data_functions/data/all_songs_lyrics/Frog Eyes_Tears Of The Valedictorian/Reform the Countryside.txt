Reform the Countryside LyricsReform your countryside! Reform your shafted side!
Konstantine: you are the beggar of the blasted blue light
Oh  Richie's in the back
He ain't going to like it when you go
And Howard sells the power to the power-hungry proles
Incriminating photo shoots that show you wearing gold
All exit patients shall book exit flights
And all the punk cry "deliver us, deliver us from the night!"
Oh baby, I've got to know, when you sing that song
Where the singer sings he's got to know
I feel this deliverance that is gained from the right
Refrom your countryside!
Blast they ticks from the blasted side!
Oh twice crooked and twice cursed night
All the punks cry "deliver us, deliver us from the night!"
She sings songs
All hands they roll, they roll to the golden tide
And take that fool out of sight, but then you
Tell him that you got no babies, that he got no babies
On and on
Refrom your countryside!
Blast they ticks from your countryside
Move thy earth in ways that your father did decide
And all the punks cry deliver us, deliver us from your night
Howard is a whirlwind you wonder where he blows
A portion of his breath is in this water don't you know
Bold broken promises left oracles in ports
And all the punks cry, "Deliver us, deliver us from your courts!"
Ah la-la
You put the baby in the bottle and then you go
And you sing that song that the General sings to the dawn
You put the baby in the bottle and the bottle and you go
And you stand up from your cupboard and you say
The world is so!
And you stand up from the river and you see its golden flow
I am going to pay you a hundred dollars
You are going to stay away from the rope
La-la-la-la-la-la
And you sing that song that the General sings to the dawnEmbed
