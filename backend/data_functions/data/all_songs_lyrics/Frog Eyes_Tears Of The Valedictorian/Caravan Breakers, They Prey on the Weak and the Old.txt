Caravan Breakers, They Prey on the Weak and the Old LyricsOh, hate so bad from the jumping pounding pad
When the crystal in the mountain made the early morning sad
I know not the remnants of the cold lieutenant’s dad
Well they know about the babies and the bottles and they go
To the country, it’s a blessing it’s a fortunate soul
I felt the Mayfair* and I felt it’s ghost
Was just a poison and a poison is supposed
To poison all the censors that deliver your ghost
I know about the babies and the bottles and they go
In a battle to the place that only one person know
Hate so bad, but
Think of what we had and
Watch the burning barrels
But the burning and it seems so sad
A ship, the ship transfer, your drunken dad
Oh I know what they rise and I know what they rail
And I watch as the teenagers they smoke on the trail
I bet you’re sick of hearing songs up on the trail
And I sing a song about ice in their sails
Oh, hate so bad from the jumping pounding pad
When the crystal in the mountain made the early morning sad
I know not the remnants of the cold lieutenant’s dad
Well they know about the babies and the bottles and they go
To the country, it’s a blessing it’s a fortunate soul
I felt the Mayfair* and I felt it’s ghost
Was just a poison and a poison is supposed
To poison all the censors that deliver your ghost
I know about the ladies and I know about the show
And I ran to the place that only one person know
Hate so bad, but
Think of what we had and
Watch the burning barrels
But the burning and it seems so sad
A ship, the ship transfer, your drunken dad
Oh I know what they rise and I know what they rail
And I watch as the teenagers they smoke up on the trail
I bet you’re sick of hearing songs up on the trail
And I sing a song about ice in their sails
I… I wait on the sad and the old
Oh caravan breakers they pray for the weak and the old
I… I wait on the weak and the old
Oh caravan breakers they pray for the weak and the old
I… I prey on the weak, weak and the old
Oh caravan breakers they fuckin’ pray for the weak, weak and the old
I… I pray for the weak, weak and the old
Oh caravan breakers they fuckin’ pray for the weak, weak and the old
Woohoo! I want a belly made of gold
Woohoo! I want a belly made of gold
Woohoo! I want a belly made of gold
Woohoo! I want a belly made of gold
Woohoo! You ain’t gonna help out nobody
Woohoo! You ain’t gonna help out nobody
Woohoo! You ain’t gonna help out nobody
Woohoo…
Oh oh oh…
La la la…Embed
