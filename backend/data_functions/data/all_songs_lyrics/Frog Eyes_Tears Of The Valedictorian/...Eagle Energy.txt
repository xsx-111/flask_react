...Eagle Energy LyricsOh "Aldous" calls his men to fall
Will they right-sit their soul?
And will they, would they, run?
Hit their elders, they're gone
Or will they: "I don't understand?"
And would you have had a rise?
"What the hell?" What they noted
Oh I know what they got, and the borders:
What they shot, shot aloud, shine alike
When Rodin willed they rise, and they're cold and know
That "They howl" when they are rising
And oh love makes your toes free "to furl"
Oh all the educators travelled on about their dawn
And their duty and their wandsEmbed
