One World Lyrics
Stop it
There's been too much debate
We could save ourselves from holocaust
Or is that just our fate
Start now
But we continue to balk
We let the genie out of the bottle
But we still hold the cork

One, Two, Not
Three, Four, Die
One, Two, Not
Three, Four, Die

Ignorance, is no excuse
For violence
No one wins
One world
One world

One world, welcome to it
One world, don't abuse it
One world, to live out your life
One world, total schism
Tunnel vision
One world, taming the beast
Fighting for peace
Killing
You pushed a button that's all you did
It's much harder to kill a man
If you've seen pictures of his kids
Responsibility
And what are all our lives worth?
What kind of sentence would you serve
For killing the earth?

One, Two, Not
Three, Four, Die
One, Two, Not
Three, Four, Die

Ignorance, is no excuse
For violence
No one wins
One world
One world

One world, welcome to it
One world, don't abuse it
One world, to live out your life
One world, total schism
Tunnel vision
One world, taming the beast
Fighting for peace

One world, welcome to it
One world, don't abuse it
One world, to live out your life
One world, total schism
Tunnel vision
One world, taming the beast
Fighting for peace

Russians
They're only people like us
Do you really think they'd blow up the world
Don't they love their lives less?
America
Stop singing hail to the chief
Instead of thinking S.D.I
He should be thinking of peace

One, Two, Not
Three, Four, Die
One, Two, Not
Three, Four, Die
Ignorance, is no excuse
For violence
No one wins
One world
One world

One world, welcome to it
One world, don't abuse it
One world, to live out your life
One world, total schism
Tunnel vision
One world, taming the beast
Fighting for peace
