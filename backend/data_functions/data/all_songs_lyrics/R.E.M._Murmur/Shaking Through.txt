Shaking Through Lyrics
Could it be that one small voice
Doesn't count in the room
Yellow like a geisha gown
Denying all the way
Could this by three be ten
Honor marches on
Yellow like a geisha gown
Denial all the way

Shaking through
Opportune
Shaking through
Opportune

Are we grown way too far
Taking after rain
Yellow like a geisha gown
Denying all the way

Shaking through
Opportune
Shaking through
Opportune
In my life

Ears that are still
Children of today on parade
Yellow like a geisha gown
Denying all the way

Shaking through
Opportune
Shaking through
Opportune

Shaking through
Opportune
Shaking through
