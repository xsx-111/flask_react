Pilgrimage Lyrics
Take a turn
Take a turn
Take a fortune
Take a fortune

They called the clip
A two-headed cow
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck with pilgrimage
Rest assured, this will not last
Take a turn for the worst
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck, a two-headed cow

The pilgrimage
Has gained momentum
Take a turn
Take a turn
Take a fortune
Take a fortune

Speaking in tongues
It's worth a broken lip
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck with pilgrimage
Rest assured, this will not last
Take a turn for the worst
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck, a two-headed cow
The pilgrimage
Has gained momentum
Take a turn (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take a fortune (Take a turn)
Take a fortune

(Ah) Pilgrimage
(Ah) Pilgrimage

Speaking in tongues
It's worth a broken lip
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck...
Rest assured, this will not last
Take a turn for the worst
Your hate, clipped and distant
Your luck, two-headed...

The pilgrimage
Has gained momentum
Take a turn (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take a fortune (Take a turn)
Take your fortune
(Ah) Pilgrimage
(Ah) Pilgrimage

Pilgrimage
Has gained momentum
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take your fortune (Take a turn)
Take your fortune (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take your turn (Take a turn)
Take your fortune (Take a turn)
Take your fortuneEmbed
