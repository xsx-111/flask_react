Moral Kiosk Lyrics
Scratch the scandals in the twilight
Trying to shock, but instead
Idle hands all orient to her
Pass a magic pillow under head

It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside cold dark fire twilight
Inside cold dark fire twilight

Scratch the scandals in the twilight
She was laughing like a Horae
Without being sour landslide
Take the steps to dash a roving eye

It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside cold dark fire twilight
Inside cold dark fire twilight

Scratch the scandals in the twilight
Trying to shock but instead
Idle hands all orient to her
Pass a magic pillow under head
It's so much more attractive
Inside the moral kiosk
Inside cold dark fire twilight
Inside cold dark fire twilight

Inside cold dark fire twilight
Inside cold dark fire twilightEmbed
