We Walk Lyrics
Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing

We walk through the woods
We walk

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing

We walk through the woods
We walk

Take oasis
Take oasis
Take oasis
Take oasis

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing
We walk through the woods
We walk

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Take oasis, Marat's bathing

Up the stairs to the landing, up the stairs into the hall
Into the, oh, oh
Into the, oh, up
Up, up, up, up
Up, up, up, up3Embed
