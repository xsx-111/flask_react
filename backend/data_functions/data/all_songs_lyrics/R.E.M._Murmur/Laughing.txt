Laughing Lyrics
Laocoön and her two sons
Pressured storm, try to move
No other more emotion bound
Martyred, misconstrued

Lighted
In a room
Lanky room
Lighted, lighted
Laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted
Laughing

Laocoön and her two sons
Run the gamut, sated view
Know them more, emotion bound
Martyred, misconstrued

Lighted
In a room
Lanky room
Lighted, lighted
Laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted
Laughing
In a room
Lock the door
Latch the room
Lighted, lighted
Laughing

Laocoön and her two sons
Ran the gamut, settled new
Find a place fit to laugh
Lock the doors and latch the room

Lighted
In a room
Lanky room
Lighted, lighted
Laughing in tune
Lighted, lighted
Laughing in tune

Lighted, lighted
Laughing in tunes
Lighted, lighted
Laughing in tunes2Embed
