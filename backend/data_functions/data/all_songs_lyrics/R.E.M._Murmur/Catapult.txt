Catapult Lyrics
When we were little boys
When we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole
Open your mouth, a question

Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?

Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult

When we were little boys
When we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, open your mouth
We in step, in hand
Your mother remembers this
Hear the howl of the rope
A question
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?

Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult

The porch could be darker
The march could be darker

Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult
Catapult (Catapult)
Catapult

When we were little boys
When we were little girls
It's nine o'clock, don't try to turn it off
Cowered in a hole, open your mouth
We in step, in hand
Your mother remembers this
Hear the howl of the rope
A question
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?
Did we miss anything?

Catapult (Catapult)
