Sitting Still Lyrics
This name I got we all agreed
C could stop, stop it well read
We could bind it in the scythe
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bar
The kitchen signs but not me in
Sit and try for the big kill
A waste of time sitting still

I'm the sun and you can read
I'm the sign and you're not deaf
We could bind it in the scythe
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bars
The kitchen signs but not me in
Sit and try for the big kill
A waste of time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
This name I got we all agreed
C could stop, stop it well read
We could bind it in the scythe
We could gather, throw a fit

Up to par and Katie bars
The kitchen signs but not me in
Sit and try for the big kill
A waste of time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you

You can gather when I talk
Talk until you're blue
You could get away from me
Get away from me

I'm up to par and Katie bars
The kitchen signs but not me in
Sit and try for the big kill
A waste of time sitting still
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
I can hear you
Can you hear me?Embed
