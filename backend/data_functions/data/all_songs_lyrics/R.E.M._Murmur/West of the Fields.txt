West of the Fields Lyrics
Long gone intuition
To assume are gone
When we try
I dream of a living jungle
Heed my way back home
When we die

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
West of the fields

Dreams of Elysian
To assume are gone
When we try
Tell now what is dreaming
When we try and listen with your eyes
Oversimplify

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
West of the fields
The antelopes are strange
Trying to sicken me
The antelopes are strange
Trying to sicken me

Dreams of Elysian
To assume are gone
When we try
Tell now what is dreaming
When we try to listen to your eyes
When we die

West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
West of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
West of the fields, west of the fields
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
West of the fieldsEmbed
