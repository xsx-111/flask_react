Another Park, Another Sunday LyricsI'm sittin' in my room, I'm starin' out my window
And I wonder where you've gone
Thinking back on the happy hours just before the dawn
Outside the wind is blowin'
It seems to call your name again, where have you gone
City streets and lonely highways, I travel down
My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down
I'm just tryin' to find me
A pretty smile that I can get into
It's true, I'm lost without you
Another lonely park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
It's warm outside, no clouds are in the sky
But I need myself a place to go and hide
I keep it to myself, I don't want nobody else
To see me cryin' all those tears in my eyes
Another lonely park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
Another park, another Sunday
It's dark and empty, thanks to you
I got to get myself together
But it's hard to do
Another park, another Sunday
Why is it life turns out that way
Just when you think you got a good thing
It seems to slip away
Another park, another Sunday
It's dark and empty, thanks to you
I got to get myself together
But it's hard to doEmbed
