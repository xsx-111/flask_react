Palomine LyricsWell I wish I had known your name
Is it possible that we might
Have felt the same
'Bout the senselessness within the air
Paints it's words almost everywhere
Now the sun will always shine
On this palomine
Well I wish I had known you then
Well who knows, I might have been a better friend
But now the senselessness within the air
Paints it's words almost everywhere
How come life sometimes
Makes you feel so scared
I know the sun will always shine
Yes the sun will always shine
And the sun will always shine
On this palomine
Well even when I think out about
The things you used to say out loud
Even then I can't say I was prepared
To settle down to what you did
You made your choice and that was it
How come life sometimes
Makes you feel so scared
And now the sun will always shine
Yes the sun will always shine
Yes the sun will always shine
On this palomineEmbed
