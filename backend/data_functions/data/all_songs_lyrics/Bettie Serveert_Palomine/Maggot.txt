Maggot LyricsWhat is it and can we make it talk?
If it's got legs, we could take it for a walk
Maybe we should tie it's hands
Before it starts to understand
Who we really are
Confusing how it romps around
Whack its head and try to cool it down
Better hold your tongue, I say
It's gonna find out any day now
Who we really are
Here we stand, look down on you
We don't understand, we're not trying to
The maggot's growing, keep it fed
Until the boil comes to a head
Maybe we should cut it dead
Or send it on a cruise instead
Seems to work so far
So, what is it and can we make it talk?
If it's got legs, we could take it for a walk
Separate the brain and head
And give it something sane instead
Seems to work so farEmbed
