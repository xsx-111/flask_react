Brain-Tag LyricsHow does this rhyme, 'cause every time I see you
Well, I could swear, must've met you somewhere
Down under lock and key
There's a brain-tag to every secret
If I could keep my mouth shut
There's a chance that I might even keep it
You feel familiar and I wanna feel some more
Have I ever laid my hands on you before?
This must sound weird, it's like you peered inside me
'Cause every time you recognize my state of mind
Down under lock and key
We put a brain-tag to every secret
Now comes a time to figure out
Whether we should keep it
You feel familiar and I wanna feel some more
Have I ever laid my hands on you before?
Total freedom beneath the waves
Floating through the arcane caves
Synchronized in time and space
Leaving all desire behindEmbed
