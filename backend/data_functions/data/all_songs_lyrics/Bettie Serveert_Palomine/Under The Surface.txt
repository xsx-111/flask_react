Under The Surface LyricsYou could travel for a lifetime
And still stay where you are
You could wait until the right time
Resolve to make or mar
People tell you what they know
They're mostly wrong from the word go
It's under the surface and it's up in the sky
That's why you won't reach it, so don't even try
The lines are old, yet still not weakened
You don't kow what to do
Cause everyone else around is sleeping
The choice is up to you
Now you better watch out what you're saying
These words could cut like swords
You better watch out while you're praying
Find out what you're praying for
People tell you what they know
They're mostly wrong from the word go
Cause it's under the surfae and it's up in the sky
That's why you won't reach it, so don't even try
It's so unexpected, now how could it be true
I never would detect it, if it hadn't been for you
Now I got this notion, and it's bottled up inside
A swamp of emotions, there's no need to hide
It's under the surface and it's up in the sky
That's why you won't reach it, so don't even tryEmbed
