Tomboy LyricsFrom where I stand, I can see
They've got the upper hand of me
Reminds me of this world at last
Simply changes much too fast for me
And when they call out, will I hear them
And when they fall out, will I see them
This yellow light, on the crowd
And colors way too loud to see
Reveals their drive, we could change it
Try to rearrange it
They call me a Tom Boy and I love it
'Cause only a Tom Boy could stand above it
And simply change it
This yellow light, on the crowd
And colors way too loud to see
Reveals their drive, we could change it
Try to rearrange it
They call me a Tom Boy and I let them
'Cause only a Tom Boy could forget them
They call me a Tom Boy and I love it
'Cause only a Tom Boy could stand above it
By simply changingEmbed
