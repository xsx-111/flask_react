Palomine (Small) LyricsWell I wish I had known your name
Is it possible that we might have felt the same
'bout the senselessness within the air
Paints it's words almost everywhere
Now the sun will always shine on this palomine
Well I wish I had known you then
Well who knows I might have been a better friend
But now the senselessness within the air
Paints it's words almost everywhere
How come life sometimes makes you feel so scared
I know the sun will always shine (2x)
Yes the sun will always shine on this palomine
Well even when I think out about
The things you used to say out loud
Even then I can't say I was prepared
To settle down to what you did
You made your choice and that was it
How come life sometimes makes you feel so scared
I know the sun will always shine (2x)
Yes the sun will always shine on this palomineEmbed
