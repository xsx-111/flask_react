Healthy Sick LyricsCircumstance's confusing
Close my eyes, it isn't there
Tell me what is so amusing
Afraid, a promise promised is just a snare
Eager to reject at first
When frank smiles only make it worse
Down to your heart
That's where it starts
Now the set up seems the same, it don't mean nothing
Eager to retract at first
When frank smiles only make it worse
Down to your toes
That's where it flows
The set up seems the same, it don't prove nothing
Eager to reject at first
When frank smiles only make it worse
Lass finds a swain
Binds'm with chains
And loosens'm again, it don't mean nothing
Sundazed to the core
I must say, I never saw it this way
But it's over now
Sundazed to the core
I must say, it started off a dog-way
But it's over nowEmbed
