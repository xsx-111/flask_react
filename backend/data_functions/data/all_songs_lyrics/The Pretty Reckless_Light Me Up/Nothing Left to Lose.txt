Nothing Left to Lose Lyrics
I was only 19, you were 29
It's just 10 years, but it's such a long time
In a heartbeat, I would do it all again
Late night sex, smokin' cigarettes
I try real hard but I can't forget
Now in a heartbeat, I would do it all again

And now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be now
Now I'm lost somewhere

Lost between Elvis and suicide
Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothin' left to lose
After Jesus and Rock 'n' Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothin' left
I've got nothin' left to lose

Callin' out sins just to pass the time
My life goes by in the blink of an eye
I know you want me
I was only looking for a friend
And everything that I was
And everything that I've become
Just falls into the end and
And now I see that you and me were never meant
Were never meant to be now
Now I'm lost somewhere

Lost between Elvis and suicide
Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothin' left to lose
After Jesus and Rock 'n' Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothin' left
I've got nothin' left to lose

And now I see that you and me were never meant
Never meant to be now
Now I'm lost somewhere

Lost between Elvis and suicide
Ever since the day we died, well
I've got nothin' left to lose
After Jesus and Rock 'n' Roll
Couldn't save my immoral soul, well
I've got nothin' left
I've got nothin' left to lose3Embed
