Miss Nothing Lyrics
I'm Miss Autonomy, Miss Nowhere
I'm at the bottom of me
Miss Androgyny, Miss Don't Care
What I've done to me
I am misused like I wanted to
Be not your slave
Misguided, high-minded
I'm missin' the train

And I don't know where I've been
And I don't know what I'm into
And I don't know what I've done to me

And as I watch you disappear into the ground
One mistake was that I never let you down
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
I'm Miss Nothing, I'm Miss Everything

I'm Miss Fortune, Miss So Soon
I'm like a bottle of pain
Miss Matter, you had her
Now she's going away
I'm Miss Used, Miss cunt-strewed
I don't need to be saved
Miss Slighted, high-minded
Iâ€™m stuck in the rain
And I don't know where I am
And I don't know what I'm into
And I don't know what I've done to me

And as I watch you disappear into the ground
One mistake was that I couldn't let you down
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
I'm Miss Nothing, I'm Miss Everything
I'm Miss Everything

And as I watch you disappear into my head
Well, there's a man who's telling me I might be dead
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
I'm Miss Nothing, I'm Miss Everything4Embed
