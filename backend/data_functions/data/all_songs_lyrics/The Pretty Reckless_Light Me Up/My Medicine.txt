My Medicine Lyrics
Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine

Well, you hurt where you sleep and you sleep where you lie
And now you're in deep and now you're gonna cry
Got a woman to your left and a boy to your right
You start to sweat so hold me tight ('cause)

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
And somebody's in my head again
And somebody mixed my medicine again, again

Well, I'll drink what you leak and I'll smoke what you sigh
See across the room with a look in your eye
Got a man to his left and a girl to his right
I start to sweat so hold me tight

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
And somebody's in my head again
And somebody mixed my medicine again, again
There's a tiger in the room and a baby in the closet
Pour another drink, mom, I don't even want it
Then I turn around and think I see someone that looks like you

Well, you hurt where you sleep and you sleep where you lie
And now you're in deep and now you're gonna cry
Got a woman to your left and a boy to your right
You start to sweat so hold me tight ('cause)

Somebody mixed my medicine
I don't know what I'm on
Somebody mixed my medicine
Now baby, it's all gone
Somebody mixed my medicine
And somebody's in my head again
And somebody mixed my medicine again, again, again
Again, again, again
Again, again, again

Somebody mixed my medicine
Somebody mixed my medicine
