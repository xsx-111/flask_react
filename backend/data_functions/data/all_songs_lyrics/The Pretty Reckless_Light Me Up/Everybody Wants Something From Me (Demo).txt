Everybody Wants Something From Me (Demo) Lyrics
Take a piece of my life, take a piece of my soul
Take a piece of my face so I can never grow old
And take a piece of my world, take a piece of my heart
Take a piece of my brain so I can never be smart

Everybody wants to see me down
Leave my body on the dirty ground
Everybody wants

I want you to abuse me, use me, shut up and do me
Cause everybody wants something from me
Grab me, stab me, go on and have me
Cause everybody wants something from me
Everybody wants something from me

Take a drink of my drink, take a drag on my drag
Take a shot of the good and take a pill for the bad
Take your momma's advice so you can do what is right
Take a knife to the bed and take a gun to the fight

Everybody wants to see me down
Everybody wants
I want you to abuse me, use me, shut up and do me
Cause everybody wants something from me
Grab me, stab me, go on and have me
Cause everybody wants something from me
Everybody wants something from me

Break me, take me
Come on and make me
Cause everybody wantsâ€¦

Abuse me, use me, shut up and do me
Cause everybody wants something from me
Grab me, stab me, come on and have me
Cause everybody wants something from me
Yeah, everybody wants something from meEmbed
