Far From Never (Demo) Lyrics
I know I fucked up this time
Just give me one more try
I know you've made up your mind
So leave me here behind you

And all the things you said
Made it harder to breathe
When I was lying on the floor
I couldn't believe you wouldn't save me
But you blame me

You cried
The fire just died, it's gone forever
And the chance to live our lives, it's gone forever
And where we stand tonight is where we stand tonight
So far from never

Well I know I messed with your mind
And wasted all your precious time
The more I try, the more I find that

All the things you said
Made it harder to breathe
When I was lying on the floor
I couldn't believe you wouldn't save me
But you blame me
You cried
The fire just died, it's gone forever
And the chance to live our lives, it's gone forever
And where we stand tonight is where we stand tonight
So far fromâ€¦

No one will never let you down
No one will never let you down
No one will never let you down
No one will never let you down

Cause the fire just died, it's gone forever
And the chance to live our lives, it's gone forever
And where we stand tonight is where we stand tonight
So far from never
So far from never
You said you'd never let me down
You said you'd never let me down1Embed
