Just Tonight Lyrics
Here we are and I can't think from all the pills, hey
Start the car and take me home
Here we are and you're too drunk to hear a word I say
Start the car and take me home

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you, just tonight

Here I am and I can't seem to see straight
But I'm too numb to feel right now
And here I am watching the clock that's ticking away my time
I'm too numb to feel right now

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you, just tonight
Just tonight
Do you understand who I am? Do you wanna know?
Can you really see through me? Now I have got to go

But just tonight I won't leave
And I'll lie and you'll believe
Just tonight I will see
That it's all because of me

Just tonight I will stay
And we'll throw it all away
When the light hits your eyes
It's telling me I'm right
And if I, I am through
Then it's all because of you
Just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight
(Do you understand who I am?)
It's all because of you, just tonight9Embed
