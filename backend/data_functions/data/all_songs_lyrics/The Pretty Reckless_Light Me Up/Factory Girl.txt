Factory Girl Lyrics
I am a factory girl, won't you pardon me?
See, I can make my whole world in a backseat
Hunts Point, what a joint, show me how to treat a John
Could someone save me? Save me from what I'm on

Wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
Hey, wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party? (Yeah)
Just let me in through the backdoor
Just let me in through the backdoor, baby
Just let me in through the backdoor
Just let me in
Wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
(It's gonna be a real good time)

I'm waitin' for my man on Hollywood and Vine (So fine)
Gettin' done in the L.A. Sun, I'm on New York time
Take a look at those red lights, green lights, blowin' my mind
I'll show you something if you show me a good time

Wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
Hey, wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
I'll let you in through the backdoor
I'll let you in through the backdoor, baby
I'll let you in through the backdoor
Just let you in
I said, wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
Here she comes, she's comin' around again
Here she comes, she's comin' around again
Here she comes, she's comin' around again
Here she comes, yeah, she's comin' again

Wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
I said, wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
Wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
Wait a minute, girl
Wait a minute, wait a minute, girl
Wait a minute, girl
Can you show me to the party?
Hey, girl
Can you show me to the party?
Hey, girl
Won't you show me to the party?

Hey, can you let a couple of my friends in too?3Embed
