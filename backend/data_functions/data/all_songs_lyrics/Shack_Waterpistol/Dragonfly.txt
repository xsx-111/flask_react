Dragonfly LyricsDragonfly, multiplying
Gone are the ties on
My lemon and lion
It’s just a feeling that I had
Scorpio rising
Mess your timing
Unsurprising
So mummy will doubt us
It’s just a feeling that I had
It’s just a feeling that I had
It’s just a feeling that I had
If you come around
Then you’ll see what I mean
Just knock on the door
And you’ll see what I mean
If you come around
Then you’ll see what I mean
Just knock on the door
And you’ll see what I mean
Dragonfly, multiplying
Gone are the ties on
My lemon and lion
Dragonfly
It’s just a feeling that I had
It’s just a feeling that I had
It’s just a feeling that I had
