London Town LyricsQueenie enters the hall
Pulls on the string
She looks semi-pleased
My nursery crown
You can feed your meter
When you’re alone
It’s not very hard
In London town
Phone your mate
At four in the morning
Keep your hair on
I still want you
Things… just fall into place
It gets a bit clearer
In London town
Yeah London town
Enter the town the centre
In search of the crack pot
Michael Thomas wore the crown
You can kick your meter
When you’re alone
It’s not very hard
In London town
Buy a rennie from the tracky
It’s the new shape for the nineties
Things just fall into place
It gets a bit cleaner
In London town
Yeah London TownEmbed
