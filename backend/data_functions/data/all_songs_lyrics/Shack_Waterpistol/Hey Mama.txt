Hey Mama LyricsAll around, all around
I used to think that falling was a game
All around, all around
Some people love to think in ways
It’s alright, it’s alright
Catch a falling star and watch it shine
It’s not there anywhere
She’s gone home, going home
She’s not there anywhere
Hey Mama
Some people love to think in ways
It’s alright, it’s alright
It’s not there anywhere
Hey Mama
Hey!Embed
