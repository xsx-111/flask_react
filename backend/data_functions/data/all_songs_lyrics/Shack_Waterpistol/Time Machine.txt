Time Machine LyricsTell us another and I’ll stay awake
Pass us a drink it’s a quarter to eight
What’s on the wind and here comes the sun
And if you really want to talk about it
You can take me there
Cause I’m all ears and whiskey tonight
But first you can stop
Sticking a stake through your heart
Gets to one when you’ve started
Your old reason why you’re falling apart
Your time machine needs a new heart
Just let’s go back to the bit where it hurt
I was fetching a drink
And I should have been there
And where are we now and what’s it to be?
Oh, I’m falling
But first you can stop
Sticking a stake through your heart
Gets to one when you’ve started
Your old reason why you’re falling apart
Your time machine needs a new heart
Love all your senses back against the fence
Love all your senses before they’re too many
Your eyes breed contentment
Arms are closed in
Now it’s my turn to state
And you’re back in late ’88
But first you can stop
Sticking a stake through your heart
Gets to one when you’ve started
Your old reason why you’re falling apart
Your time machine needs a new heartEmbed
