Neighbours LyricsLook from your window, stop raining
Look for a fella who’s still outside
All he wants is to be a dealer
All he’s got left of the pride
Was it something you’re saying?
Is it something to tell me?
Are you scared of the neighbours?
Was it something on telly?
When you’re not with him it’s different
Look for a way it’s not inside
And all she’s got left of the pride
Was it something you’re saying?
Is it something to tell me?
Are you scared of the neighbours?
Was it something on telly?
What’s it like when you’ve been there?
And not just getting there?
Let’s get over there
Was it something you’re saying ?
Is it something to tell me ?
Let’s get rid of the neighbours
Let’s get rid of the telly
What’s it like when you’ve been there ?
And not just getting there
Let’s get over there
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me homeEmbed
