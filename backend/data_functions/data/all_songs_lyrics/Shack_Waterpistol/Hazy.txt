Hazy LyricsHazy put his feet upon the set
Siobhan said you’re too young for me yet
Hazy put his feet down on the floor
Siobhan roared “I didn’t mean to do it no more”
I didn’t mean to do it no more
Angling for another cup of tea
Fixed the clock
And pretend there’s loads of time
Siobhan’s seen a hundred cheeky smiles
Doesn’t care, she sorts them every time
She sorts them every time
Hazy, tread softly
You know now
You’re off the case
Hazy put his feet upon the set
Siobhan said you’re too young for me yet
Hazy put his feet down on the floor
Siobhan roared “I didn’t mean to do it no more”
I didn’t mean to do it no more
Hazy, tread softly
You know now
You’re off the case
Hazy, tread softly
You know now
You’re off the case
What was that thing that you done
And how can you dream without loneliness
What was that thing that you done
Just leave that far behind you
And I’m not far behind you
And I’m not far behind you
And I’m not far behind youEmbed
