Mr. Appointment LyricsPhilip King got the answer
And it helped him one night
Left his mates on the sofa
He said they’d be alright
He never showed up all night
Mr Appointment is right
Took the cab to the station
His own wheels too bright
Didn’t think that the answer
Could end up in a fight
Nobody saw him all night
Mr Appointment, too right
Ain’t that a shame
Mr Appointment
He’s always running
Mr Appointment
Philip King, Philip King
Philip King got the answer
And it helped him one night
Left his mates on the sofa
He thought they’d be alright
He never showed up all night
Mr Appointment is right
Ain’t that a shame
Mr Appointment
He’s always running
Mr Appointment
You’ll never find him
Hero or villain
And you’ll never catch him
Mr Appointment
Philip King
One, and two, and three, and four
D’you read the news today oh boy
Let me say…Embed
