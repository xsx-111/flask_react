Undecided LyricsYou’re surprising
No denying
Undecided, make your mind up
There she goes, then she goes
Everyone knows she goes
There she goes, then she goes
Everyone knows she goes
Beautiful, beautiful
And you can meet somebody
It’s got to be like sticking a needle
In your arm when you’re sleeping
And then you can be somebody
Bad your timing
No denying
Undecided
When it’s like butterflies
Everything seems alright
When it’s nice it’s all right
Everything’s out of sight
Beautiful, beautiful
And you can feed somebody
It’s got to be like sticking a needle
In your arm when you’re sleeping
And then you can be somebody
What’s it like to feel somebody
Everyone knows she goes
There she goes, then she goes
Everyone knows she goes
Undecided
Undecided
Undecided
BeautifulEmbed
