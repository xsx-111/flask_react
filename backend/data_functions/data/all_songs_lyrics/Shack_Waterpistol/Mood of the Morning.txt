Mood of the Morning LyricsMy baby loves Happy Mondays
My baby drinks leftovers in the morning
She’s always singing and yawning
She’s into the mood of the morning
Supposing you’re feeling lazy
She decides she wants to go crazy
And she’s always singing and yawning
Cause she’s into the mood of the morning
My baby baby’s into the mood of the morning
My baby baby’s into the mood of the morning
She’s always singing and yawning
Cause she’s into the mood of the morning
When she’s gone it’s like nobody cares
Empty eyes, empty stares
She will ride she loves it always
Coming back anytime
Coming back come and find
My baby loves Happy Mondays
My baby loves Happy Mondays
My baby drinks left-overs in the morning
Supposing you’re feeling lazy
She decides she wants to go crazy
My baby loves Happy MondaysEmbed
