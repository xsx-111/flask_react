Sgt. Major LyricsYou could be the Sergeant Major
If you really want to
Aspire to be the centre stage
If the boot should fit you
Lucy’s on the highest mountain
Chat about it with the turf accountant
Oh, come with me
Wanda wants to be the leader
And she says she’s got to
Whacked it into Conde Vita
And the clothes are brand new
Wanda says she’ll sort it later
Wants to be known as the alligator
Oh, come with me
Yeah, there’s time
Come with me
Yeah there’s time
Come with me
You can be the Sergeant Major
If you really want to
Aspire to the centre stage
If the boot should fit you
Lucy’s on the highest mountain
Chat about it with the turf accountant
Oh, come with me
Yeah, there’s time
Come with me
Yeah, there’s time
Come with
Wanda says she’ll sort it later
Wants to be known as the alligator
Oh, come with me
Yeah, there’s time
Come with me
Yeah there’s time
Come with me
You know there’s time. Come withEmbed
