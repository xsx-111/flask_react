Stranger LyricsCatch a falling star and make it happen
Put a pocketful in your sky
Through the window pane and make it happen
When I wanna be gets you by
There’s just one way to get it in the city
Through the wall where you know
There’s no doors now
You know the mockingbird’s on the couch
Then the window tries to make it happen
The words are slowly coming out your mouth
There’s just one way to get it in the city
There’s just one way to make it in the city
Catch a falling star and make it happen
Put a pocketful in your sky
Through the window pane and make it happen
When I wanna be gets you by
There’s just one way to get it in the city
There’s just one way to make it in the city
It’s right
Gone are the days
When you walked through the door
Gone are the days
When you walked through the door
It must be heading like nothing you’ve had before
Yes, you’ve gone, you’ve gone down river
And it’s right
Stranger
Stranger
Stranger
