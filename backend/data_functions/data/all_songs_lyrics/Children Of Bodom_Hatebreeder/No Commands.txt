No Commands LyricsLooking at myself in the mirror, is it me ?
Anybody there ? I ask myself and look away
Feeling weird things in my head, controlling me ?
Hearing strange voices everywhere, calling me ?
All illusion ?
What is happening to me, my hands are working
Without my own will
Is there someone else inside of me, who are you ?
I know I'm not dreaming
Somebody tortures me all the time
Got my own soul escape me body, filled with
Torture and pain
No Commands, no more
Take no orders from you no more
No Commands, no more
I'm on my own, don't own me anymore
Evil powers try to take me, can I be the same anymore
But I'll whip you out myself, out of my mind
Evil torture and hell's fire
Gonna rule me no more
Still I'm scared 'cos I can't know
Will my soul come back
Come back I
No Commands, no more
Take no orders from you no more
No Commands, no more
I'm on my own, don't own me anymoreEmbed
