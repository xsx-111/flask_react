Black Widow Lyrics(Fuck!)
(Right!)
(Fire!) the fire is more right than my eyes
Don't remain, go misplay, you're so, so wild
(Traitor!) your vengeance night, yes, always for me
Always now, once you know, widow
(Right!)
(Murder!) your fire murders all my problems
Ah (oh yeah!)
(Chorus:)
Fire: here I see the fire in my heart
Traitor: hate your face, obey or you're gonna die
Murder: murderer in you call me to die
Oh yeah: I'll come back to you when I'm dead
Your voice is getting closer (today: fuck every day!)
Sleep up in the night - the Lord doesn't matter in my fight
Widow, tell me the reason
(Chorus:)
Fire: fire is into turning in my heart
Traitor: hate your face, obey or you're gonna die
Murder: praying on my knee, I saw her near, come here
Fire: I'll come back to you when I'm dead
I'm dead: this is all, widowEmbed
