Warheart Lyrics"From now on we are enemies.... You and I!"
I'm an outcast on the path of rebound
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush and burn
I have chosen darkness to be my guide
War is in my heart, death is by my side
Warheart!
No remains from compassion or love
Warheart!
Hate your fellow as yourself
I have chosen night to be my guide
When the daylight strikes I hide in my trench and die
I'm the coldblooded killer, who'll fuck you up
Warheart!
No remains from compassion or love
Warheart!
Hate your fellow as yourself
Today I'm the warheart I'm dying to win
The battle I live everyday
One for all, all for me
I'm an animal, better set me free
I'm an outcast on the path of rebound
Everything is frail, I desolate, crush and burn
I have chosen darkness to be my guide
War is in my heart, death is by my side
Warheart!
No remains from compassion or love
Warheart!
Hate your fellow as yourself
Today I'm the warheart I'm dying to win
The battle I live everyday
One for all, all for me
I'm an animal, better set me...
Today I'm the warheart I'm dying to win
The battle I live everyday
One for all, all for me
I'm an animal, better set me freeEmbed
