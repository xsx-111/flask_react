Wrath Within LyricsOnce I desire, eternity has come
Pull back, the tale is black, all we have to die
You say so, I am invading vision, satisfy
Once I look back, so miracle
On a crib with the night
Sensation, call me to die
Look down, we have to sow
And all waits to say go
Once I desire, be back to hear this cry: let me out
And I am the first one, any want to die!?
With my salvation within your pain
You gotta develop pain into your desires
What it always about: you raise your pain
Why you can't desire your cold regained?
Come on, get down
I touch your legs, so cold, make me cold in the light
And I burn now, no pain
Your pain seems so far away
So everything that's cold in light may die down
You raise your pain
And I kill your strain
Anyway, I get into your desires my way
I crave your pain
I can't swallow your pain: why you returned?Embed
