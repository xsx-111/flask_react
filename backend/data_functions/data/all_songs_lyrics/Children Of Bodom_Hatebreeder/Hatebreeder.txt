Hatebreeder LyricsI've found session, betrayed now, it's on now
I saw, human, I see so
Well I am certain of, I don't know how
Other souls beyond this smile
I hate you from the bottom of my heart
I have no fucking right now, I see so
Beside you, I saw, your ignition
Other souls beyond this smile
Well I thought now I said I saw some ignition
I saw it, your vanity, your mentality for sure!..
...Never seen the fooled, beast inside of me
Well I'm an asshole, and really will always be
So why now, let it be
Is that so fucking hard, be dead, I'm free
Burn it hard, make a void that sucks to the suction drive
We need the open thing with my special little part of life
I'm accessing in the northern light
You know I got no fucking other souls guilty now
I've got no fine, no fucking thoughts, so
A combination, now you're fucking dead
Never seen the fooled beast inside of me
Well I'm an asshole, and really will always be
So why now, let it be
Is that so fucking hard, be dead, I'm freeEmbed
