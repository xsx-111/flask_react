Aces High LyricsThere goes the siren that warns of the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
(Won't you)
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces High
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 O'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press down my guns
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving, going in
Running, scrambling, flying
Rolling, turning, diving
Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
(Won't you)
Run, live to fly, fly to live. Aces HighEmbed
