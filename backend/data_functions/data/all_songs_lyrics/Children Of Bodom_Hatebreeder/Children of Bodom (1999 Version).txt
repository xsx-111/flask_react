Children of Bodom (1999 Version) LyricsIn the silence of darkness, among the shadows of the dead we hear
A wolf howling hungry to wake up children of the graves
Unripe Vengeance! The cult that serves as revenge
Has put forward it's fangs to declare a fucking WAR!
Only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by the altars of Bodom
Where everything but death is a lie
To spill your blood to become our wine
We'll reborn really where only the wild will survive
The clash of wickedness veils Lake Bodom blood red
We have gathered our souls to praise the triumph of Death
Children of Bodom
Angry are rising
Running amok, slaying
With a sense of desire
From the twilight of the past
Among the victims who died
Only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by the altars of Bodom
Where everything but death is a lie
To spill your blood to become our wine
We'll reborn really where only the wild will survive
This is the dawn of the final phase, we have gathered our en darkened souls to praise the triumph of their death
You'll obey the dark you'll be one of us
Traitors!
Children of Bodom
Angry are rising
Running amok, slaying
With a sense of desire
From the twilight of the past
Among the victims who died
Something Wild has survived!Embed
