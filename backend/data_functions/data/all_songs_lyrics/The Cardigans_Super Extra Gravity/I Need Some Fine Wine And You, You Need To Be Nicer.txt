I Need Some Fine Wine And You, You Need To Be Nicer Lyrics
Sit
Good dog
Stay
Bad dog
Whoo
Down
Roll over

Well, here's a good man and a pretty young girl
Trying to play together somehow
I'm wasting my life, you're changing the world
I get drunk and watch your head grow

It's the good times that we shared
And the bad times that we'll have
It's the good times
And the bad times that we had

Well it's been a long slow collision
I'm a pitbull, you're a dog
Baby you're foul in clear conditions
But you're handsome in the fog
So I need some fine wine
And you, you need to be nicer
For the good times and the bad times
That we'll have
Sometimes we talk over dinner like old friends
Till I go and kill the bottle
I go off over any old thing
Break your heart and raise a glass or ten

To the good times that we shared
And the bad times that we'll have
To the good times
And the bad times that we've had

Well it's been a long slow collision
I'm a pitbull, you're a dog
Baby you're foul in clear conditions
But you're handsome in the fog
So I need some fine wine
And you, you need to be nicer
For the good times and the bad times
We know will come, yeah
I need some fine wine
And you, you need to be nicer
We need to be nicer
You and me
For the good times
And the bad times that we had
Sit
Good times
Bad times
Sweet wine
Bad wine
Good cop
Bad cop
Lapdog
Bad dog
