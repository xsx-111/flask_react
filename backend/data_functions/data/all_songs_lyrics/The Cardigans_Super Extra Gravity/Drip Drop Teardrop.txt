Drip Drop Teardrop Lyrics
I'm gonna watch you while you get me wrong
I'm gonna sing until you hate this song
I'm gonna tell you in my sweetest voice
I'm gonna choose you 'cause you have no choice

This funny thing we've got
Is never gonna stop
Oh no

I'm gonna take you to the wilderness
I'm gonna show you things you might have missed
I'm gonna kiss the parts that you have lost
It's gonna cost you but you might hurt less

This funny thing we've got
Is never gonna stop
This funny thing we've got
Is never gonna stop until
Drip drop teardrop
Will we ever learn?

I'm gonna work 'til we get it on
I'm gonna love you 'til we get along
And when your ears and your eyes are sore
I'm gonna love you just a little bit more
This funny thing we've got
Is never gonna stop
This funny thing we've got
Is never gonna stop until
Drip drop teardrop
Will we ever
Will we ever
Will we ever learn?Embed
