Holy Love Lyrics
When you love
I can feel your love
Shooting holes in my stupid pride
When you love
I don't fear your love
Of all the angels you're the most divine
Holy love

You can really have anything you want from me
Anything you ask me to, I'll do
We can live in poverty or prosperity
Anything impossible, I'll try
You can really have everything you ask
And I'll be intimate with you
Giving everything over
To making everything right
Holy love

When you love
I can feel your love
Shooting holes in my stupid pride
When you love
I don't fear your love
Of all the angels you're the most divine
Of holy love
You can really make anyone you want of me
Anyone you need tonight, I'll be
Whether you want empathy, animosity
An enemy or company, call me
I can even be nothing if you ask
I'll turn invisible for you
I'm the bird on your shoulder
Singing songs through the night
Holy love

When you love
I can feel your love
Throwing rocks through the windows of a monastery
Love makes me feel the super extra gravity of God
Yeah
And life

When you love
I can feel your love
Of all the angels you're the most divineEmbed
