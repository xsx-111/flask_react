In The Round Lyrics
I am young and I'm alive
I wanna talk about things
I am young and I own my life
I need to talk about it, baby
I am one but I asked for two
I didn't get anything
This puppet's lonely without you
It's tough to walk without strings

I do my dance in the round

I'm right on track
But this state is frail
You slip out and derail

I do my dance in the round
So people clap your hands
Clap your hands
I want to do it right this time
I wanna step in time
I want to do it right this time, yeah
Clap your hands
I gotta get get it right this time
I wanna step in time
I want to do it right this time
I do my dance in the round

I am young, coming at you live
People gonna talk about me
When I'm done, please hang me high
For everybody to see

'Cause I do my dance in the round
So people clap your hands

I wanna get it right
I'm dying to get it right
I wanna get it right
I'm dying to get it right
Clap your handsEmbed
