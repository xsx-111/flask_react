Overload Lyrics(Happ, då kör vi nu)

Overload
Oh, what a match we are
As we romance along
Towards the fire escape
Open fire
Forever in your arms
Splendid time we have
Doing what I dread
Oh my Lord
Can I buy some time?

I'm learning to dance
Dum-ditty-dance
I am dancing, okay

Overlord
Lord of the underworld
Full-of-wonder-girl
As we twist and twirl
Hot and dry
High in my cloven heels
This is how real love feels
As we prance and die
Oh my Lord
Such a fancy fire

As we dance
You sure can dance
Dance, dance

You I will never forget
I hope you remember me later
We're swimming in a puddle of sweat
I'm hot baby, don't burn your fingers
I'm tenderly served on your plate
The band must continue to play

So we can dance
I love to dance
Baby, dance with me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh uh ooh)
Yeah
I can dance
To love is to dance
Now dance me home1Embed
