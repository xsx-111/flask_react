Little Black Cloud Lyrics
A black cloud's hanging over town tonight
But I don't mind, I don't mind
There's a cold breeze cutting through the summer air
But I'm not scared, I don't care
'Cause we dance the night away
Let's dance the night away, yeah

The black cloud whispering into my ear
But I don't hear, I won't hear
'Cause the arms that hold me want an eye to eye
He's touching me and I don't mind
As we dance the night away
Let's dance the night away

Oh yeah
The music wants me tonight
What time will you let me down?
I look pretty good tonight
Oh yeah
Little black cloud
Little black cloud
I don't want to go home
The black cloud's circling over me tonight
But I don't mind and you don't mind
If you're cold I'll tell you it's the summer breeze
Just dance with me, we'll be alright

Oh yeah
The music wants me tonight
What time will you let me down?
I look pretty great tonight
Oh yeah
Little black cloud
Little black cloud
I'm not done yet
Hey, look at me
The music wants me tonight
What time will you let me down?
I look really great tonight
Oh yeah
Little black cloud
Little black cloud
I don't wanna go home
I'm not done yet
I'm not done yetEmbed
