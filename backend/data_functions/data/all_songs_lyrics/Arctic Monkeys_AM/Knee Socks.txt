Knee Socks Lyrics
You got the lights on in the afternoon
An' the nights are drawn out long
And you’re kissin' to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sittin' in the corner with the coats, all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well, you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feelin' I might have lit the very fuse
That you were tryin' not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was actin' like I knew
‘Cause I had nothin' to lose
When the winter’s in full swing
And your dreams just aren’t comin' true
Ain’t it funny what you’ll do?
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
Never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
All the zeros lined up
But the number’s blocked
When you’ve come undone
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (Could be my baby)

When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
When the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
When you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
