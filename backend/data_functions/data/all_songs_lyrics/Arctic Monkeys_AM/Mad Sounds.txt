Mad Sounds Lyrics
Mad sounds in your ears
Make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears
Make you get up and dance
Make you get up
Yeah, they make you get up
Love buckles under the strain
Of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide

Mad sounds, in your ears
Make you get up and dance
Make you get up
All night long they reappear
Make you get up and dance
Yeah, they make you get up

Suppose you've gotta do what you've gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes
But you just canâ€™t figure out what went wrong

Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh

You got those mad sounds, in your ears
To make you get up and dance
Mad sounds, in your ears
They make you get up and dance
Hold on to make you get up
Ah yeah, they make you get up

Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
Ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh25Embed
