One for the Road Lyrics
One for the road, oooh oooh
One for the road, oooh oooh

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling
Don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road
Oooh oooh, one for the road

Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
One for the road
So we all get back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?65Embed
