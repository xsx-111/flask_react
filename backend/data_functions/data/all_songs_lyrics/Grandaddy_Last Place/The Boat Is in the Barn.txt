The Boat Is in the Barn Lyrics
I saw you sitting at a table by the water
And you were going through the photos on your phone
You looked so happy and relieved to be there all alone
Getting rid of all of me is what I figured
Delete, deleting everything that had occurred
That's when I backed away and headed out without a word

But no, my love ain’t gone
The boat is in the barn
Oh no, my love ain’t gone
The boat is in the barn

Back at the house, I got a lot to keep me going
It’s like you’ve never lived here after all
Maybe except for that one picture on the mudroom wall
I took it at the lake while you were water skiing
And it’s without a doubt my favorite one of you
You were a wonder while you hovered out above the blue (blue blue blue blue)

But no, my love ain’t gone
The boat is in the barn
Oh no, my love ain’t gone
The boat is in the barn

Oh no, my love ain’t gone
The boat is in the barn
Oh no, my love ain’t gone
The boat is in the barnEmbed
