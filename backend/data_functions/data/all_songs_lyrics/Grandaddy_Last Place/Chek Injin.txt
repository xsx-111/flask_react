Chek Injin LyricsDuck tape over the temp gauge
Don't worry it isn't the new rage
Black tape over the fuel light
Exhaust leak and not feeling alright
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check engine
Light
Please keep going
Please keep going
Please keep going
Please keep going
Duck tape over the whole thing
Earplugs worn in the morning
Lug nuts loose on the freeway
Don't worry it isn't the new rage
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check engine
Light
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check
Check engine, check engine
Check engine, check engine
Light
Please keep going
Please keep going
Please keep going
Please keep going
Please keep going
Please just make it to my exit
Please keep goingEmbed
