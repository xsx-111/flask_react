Brush with the Wild LyricsForget the words, the pictures are nice
And dream of a girl or somebody else’s life
I'm trying a road that’s dead on the end
That’s how it goes, so copy and save and send

A brush with the wild, we were the best
It’s all I recall, I forget the rest
I’ll wait for a bus, I'm boarding a plane
I’m insane
A brush with the wild, we were the best
It’s all I can do, a beautiful mess
I’m making the call, my message is lame
I’m insane

We had a thing whatever it’s called
And you were a dream, and I was a concrete wall
There’s a fox in the snow, alone by a fence
But the fence’s too tall, now it’s making me all depressed
A brush with the wild, we were the best
It’s all I recall, I forget the rest
I’ll wait for a bus, on board on a place
I’m insane
A brush with the wild, we were the best
It’s all I can do, a beautiful mess
I’m making the call, my message is lame
I’m insane
I’m calling you now, my message is lame
I’m insane
I’m missing you now, my message is lame

My message is lame
I’m insane
I’m insane2Embed
