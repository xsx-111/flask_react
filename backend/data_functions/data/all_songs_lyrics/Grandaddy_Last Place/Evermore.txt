Evermore LyricsEvermore, gone but not forgotten
Anyway thereâ€™s more
Evermore, lost but not for nothing
Here, but then what for?
And when you soar, drop a thought for Stockton
Out your airline door
And when you soar, toss that thought to Stockton
Ask me on the phone
Are you good and gone?
Grieve like a freeway tree
Old and grey, no love in your leaves
Breath like a freeway tree
Lonely days, no love in your leaves
No love in your leaves
Evermore, nothing lasts forever
This was never yours
And evermore, when remembering is
What forgetting's for
And when you soar, drop a thought for Stockton
Out your airline door
And when you soar, toss that thought to Stockton
Ask me on the phone
Are you good and gone?
Grieve like a freeway tree
Old and grey, no love in your leaves
Breath like a freeway tree
Lonely days, no love in your leaves
No love in your leavesEmbed
