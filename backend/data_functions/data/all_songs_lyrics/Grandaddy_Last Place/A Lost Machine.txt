A Lost Machine Lyrics
Surveillance audio recorder in a dried-up creek
And we’re headed to the temporary shelter at the roller rink
Every woman and child and man in the canyon land
In a trance and wandering around in the canyon land

Airplane station is a pretty great place to hide
Live old-time music and it’s warm inside
Every woman and child and man in the canyon land
In a trance and wandering around in the canyon land

Antique photos of celebrities
Samsung black-and-white fade-away qualities
Every woman and child and man in the canyon land
In a trance and wandering about in the canyon land

Surveillance video recorder hidden in a tree
You and I are on the lawn and it’s focusing in on me
Every woman and child and man
In a trance and wandering around in the canyon land

Everything about us is a lost machine
Everything about us is a lost machine
Everything about we is a forgotten dream
Everything about us is a lost machine
Everything about us is a lost machine
Everything about us is a lost machine
Everything about we is a forgotten dream
Everything about us is a lost machine

Everything about us is a lost machine
Everything about us is a lost machine
Everything about we is a final dream
Everything about us is a lost machineEmbed
