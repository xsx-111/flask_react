Songbird Son LyricsHe was a songbird son
She was a Hitchcock blonde
And they were on the run
She was on some toothache diet
He’d become so unexcited
On a canal bank night
Under a glove box light
His summer song died quiet
Songbird son you lost your right to sing
Message better left unsent
Don’t say nothing
Message better left unsent
Don’t say nothing

And so they made their camp
On a runaway truck ramp
Yeah, they were on the run
The tent gets filled with sun
And in her dreams the tanning bed turns on
And now the chapter crash
The CHP lights flash
His summer song died quiet
Songbird son you lost your right to sing
Message better left unsent
Don’t say nothing
Message better left unsent
Don’t say nothing
Some things better left unsaid
Don’t say nothing
Message better left unsent
Don’t say nothingEmbed
