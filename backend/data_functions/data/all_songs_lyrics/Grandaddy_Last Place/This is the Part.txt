This is the Part Lyrics
This is the part
That shouldn't had been hard
Where there is peace
You will not find me

This is the part
Now let me warn my heart
This won't go smooth
This won't go down with you

Where there was love
Now there's some other stuff
Where there is peace
You know I will not be

This is the part
The ending to the start
Where there was calm
It's only going wrong

This is the part
Where I put up my guard
Where there is peace
It's there I will not be
This is the part
Some call a broken heart
Put down the phone
There's no one coming home

This is the part
That shouldn't had been hard
Where there is peace
You will not findEmbed
