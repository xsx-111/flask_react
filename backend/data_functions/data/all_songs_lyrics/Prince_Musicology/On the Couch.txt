On the Couch Lyrics
Come on, baby
Ooh, ooh
Don't make me sleep on the couch
No, no, no
"Love Jones" is on the TV again, baby
Ooh, I wanna go down south, yeah

Come on, baby
Come on, baby
It's so undignified to sleep alone
Oh, yes it is
That's what all the people ain't got nobody do
You know they do
Talking on the telephone

Don't make me crash
Don't you do it baby
(Don't you do it, uh-uh)
Don't make me sleep without your kiss
Oh darling, without your kiss
(Don't you make me do it)
Tossing and a-turning
Every inch of me yearning
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me. suffer for this

I know, I know, I know, I know that
We agreed to be married
(You know I know)
Shouldn't let me unzip your dress
Why'd you do it, baby
Why'd you do it, oh yeah
Confess you tease, unless you please me
Don't make me
Don't make me sleep on the couchEmbed
