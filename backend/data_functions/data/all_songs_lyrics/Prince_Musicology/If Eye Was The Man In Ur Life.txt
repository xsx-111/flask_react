If Eye Was The Man In Ur Life Lyrics
If I was the man in your life
I'd make you happy, I'd treat you right
I'd buy you flowers every single day
I'd give you power, I'd do whatever you say

I heard a rumor that you are man he said he'd do you wrong
And you are so vain you'd think that you are the one behind this song
Sure you know he got plenty lyrics, yeah, up his sleeve
And after he got what he want he just go up and leave
And Sunday chocolate on the roof right after his game
He like the Lakers but the Sixers on when he came
If he's with another now you best believe the party's crackin'
You are getting played girl, you better get your mack on

And do onto others as they do onto you
You call me on the day that you and him are just too through
Ooh, ooh

If I was the man in your life
I'd make you happy, I'd treat you right
I'd buy you flowers every single day
I'd give you power, I'd do whatever you say
Was it you that I saw outside the liquor store
Waiting on that fool to purchase what you been dying for?
And before I see you drop a spill I have to bring you down
Now you got that chocolate barracuda hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round your neck like a cheap gold chain
He don't deserve to say that he ever knew your name
Much less he get to smell the perfume I gave you
Please don't tell me that you all got down

Better do onto others as they do onto you
You call me on the day that you and him are just too through

If I was the man in your life
I'd make you happy, I'd treat you right
I'd buy you flowers every single day
I'd give you power, I'd do whatever you say
Do whatever you sayEmbed
