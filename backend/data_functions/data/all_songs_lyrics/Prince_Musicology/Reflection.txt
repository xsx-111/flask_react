Reflection Lyrics
Two sevens together
Like time, indefinite
Trying to catch the glass before it falls
Without a frown
Can you turn up the stereo?
I want to play you this old song, it's about love
Can I do that?

Did we remember to water the plants today?
I forgot to look up at the moon because
I was too busy, said I was too busy
I was too busy
Looking at you babe
Still it's nice to know
That, uh when bodies wear out
We can get another

What does that one thing have to do
With the other one?
I don't know
I was just thinking about my mother
You know what
Turn the stereo back down
Ain't nothing worse than an old worn out love song
Tell me do you like my hair this way
Remember all the way back in the day
When we would compare whose afro was the roundest
Mirrored tiles above the bed
Fishing nets and posters all over the wall, oh yes
Sometimes, sometimes I just want to go sit out on the stoop
And, uh, play my guitar
Just watch all, all the cars go byEmbed
