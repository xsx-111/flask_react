Musicology Lyrics
Heard about the party now
Just east of Harlem
Doug E's going to be there
But you got to call him
Even the soldiers
Need a break sometimes
Listen to the groove, y'all
Let it unwind our mind
No intoxication
Unless you see what I see
Dancing hot and sweaty
Right in front of me
Oh, call it what you like
I'm going to call it how it be
This is just another one of God's gifts
Musicology

Keep that party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old school joint
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology
Wish I had a dollar
For every time you say
Don't you miss the feeling music gave you
Back in the day?
Let's Groove "September"
Earth, Wind and Fire
"Hot Pants" by James
Sly is gonna take you higher
Minor keys and cussin'
Don't make a roller skate jam
Take your pick, turntable or a band?
Lordy
If it ain' t Chuck D or Jam Master Jay
Know what? They're losing
'Cause we got a PhD in
Advanced Body Movin'

Keep the party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old-school joints
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology!
All right
Hold it down, band
"Get back! Move, get back!
Don't you touch my stereo, these are my records!
Don't touch, ever touch, these are my records!"

Musicology
Musicology

Everybody get down!
Kick the high-school joints
For the true funk soldiers
Good God
Keep the party movin'
Keep the party movin'
Uh, don't stop dancin'
Keep, keep, keep the party movin'
Musicology
Keep the party movin'
Just like I told ya
Kick the old-school joints
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology
For the true funk soldiers
Good God
On the one, y'all
Don't you hear this old school joint?
Don't you ever touch my stereo
'Cause I said I got good and plenty of what you need the most
And that's time

If I was your girlfriend
Seventeen days
Watch it now
Rockin' you coast to coast...
Little red corvette
Hip and lips, chips and whips1Embed
