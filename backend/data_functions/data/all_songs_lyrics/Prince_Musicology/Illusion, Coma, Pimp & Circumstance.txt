Illusion, Coma, Pimp & Circumstance Lyrics
She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance

She was older but rich beyond compare
Drop a thousand dollars at the salon just to get her hair did
He was good at compliments, better in the bunk
She laced him with a crib in Paris, he hipped her to the funk
Way too fine he was for her
A dirty dog in expensive fur
As long as she's providing chips and whips
We can do this funky thing
As long as she was playing the host
He figured he would make the most of them hips and lips
He hooked her up, rocked her coast to coast
(Ugly) So ugly, rich beyond compare
She's dropped a couple hundred thousand dollars on a silver whip
Just to match the colour of her hair
She said "I got plenty of what you need
Put the spoon down honey, came on, let mama feed you"
She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance

Where was I? Oh yeah
A gentleman he was
He never spoke about her nose
So prominent because in the dark it'd glow
If she was only tan instead of so lily white
Her name was Doris but he called her "Fluo"
As in "-Rescent" - That ain't right
Fluorescent every night
A situation bound to fail
As sure as Doris's skin was pale
Money might talk, but what does it say?
You better get busy if you want to get paid
"Boy, I was fine back in the day"

She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance
He spent her money oh so well
Take a bath in cold Cristal
He took a trip to burn an old flame in Frisco, like wow
But Doris caught him in her arms
She shrugged her shoulders and said "No harm"
Just put your name on this pre-nup and we can all hit the disco

She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance
She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance

Now, dance
