Dear Mr. Man Lyrics
What's wrong with the world today?
Things just gotta get better
Sure ain't what the leaders say
Maybe we should write a letter

Say dear Mr. Man
We don't understand
Why poor people keep struggling
But you don't lend a helping hand
Matthew 5:5 say
The meek shall inherit the earth
We wanna be down that way
But you been tripping since the day of your birth
Who said
That to kill is a sin
Then started every single war
That your people been in?
Who said that water
Is a precious commodity
Then dropped a big old black oil slick
In the deep blue sea?
Who told me, Mr. Man
That working 'round the clock
Would buy me a big house in the 'hood
With cigarette ads on every block
Who told me Mr. Man
That I got a right to moan?
How 'bout this big old hole
In the ozone?

What's wrong with the world today
Things just got to get better
Dear Mr. Man, we don't understand
Maybe we should write a letter

Listen, ain't no sense in voting
Same song with a different name
Might not be in the back of the bus
But it sure feels just the same
Ain't nothing fair about welfare
Ain't no assistance in AIDS
Ain't nothing affirmative about your actions
Till the people get paid
You're thousand years are up
Now you gotta share the land
Section one, the fourteenth Amendment says:
No state shall deprive any person
Of life, liberty, or property
Without due process of law, Mr. Man
We want to end this letter with three words
"We tired  of y'all!"
Tired, tired
So tired
Mr. ManEmbed
