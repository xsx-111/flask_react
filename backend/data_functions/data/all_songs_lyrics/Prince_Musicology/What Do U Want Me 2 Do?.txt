What Do U Want Me 2 Do? Lyrics
I see you picked me out from the crowd
Could it be the way I play guitar?
Master of the soft, not too loud
One day maybe I will be a star
I see you picked me out like you want something
Shame on you babe, can't you see this ring?

What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?

I got a woman, you got a man
So we got to do what's right
I said you'd get beheaded in other lands
If I were in your arms tonight
Quit trying to get me under that icy plunder
Boy oh boy, what a scare!

What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?
You picked me out of the crowd and
Ooh, just so bold and so proud and
Dressed like you want everybody to just say
"Wow! Didn't her mama teach her better?
Ow! Dressed like that somebody gon' get her!"

I see you picked me from the crowd
Could it be the way I play guitar?
Master of the soft, not too loud
I don't ever really want to be where you are

What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?
What do you want me to do, girl?
What do you want me to do, babe?Embed
