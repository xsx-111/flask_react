Cinnamon Girl Lyrics
As war drums beat in Babylon
Cinnamon Girl starts to pray
I never heard a prayer like this one
Never before that day

Tearful words of love for people she had never met before
Asking God to grant them mercy in this face of a holy war

Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl

Cinnamon Girl of mixed heritage
Never knew the meaning of color lines
9-1-1 turned that all around
When she got accused of this crime

So began the mass illusion, war on terror alibi
What's the use when the God of Confusion keeps on telling the same lie?

Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Don't cry, don't shed no tears
One night won't make us feel
'Cause we know how this movie's ending

Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl

As war drums beat in Babylon
And scorch the blood red sky
Militants bomb the foreign gun
Both side's children die

Cinnamon Girl opens the book she knows will settle all the scores
Then she prays after the war that there will not be any more

Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Don't worry, baby, it's gonna be alright
