Walking in the Shadow of the Blues LyricsI love the blues, they tell my story
If you don't feel it you can never understand
So many times I thought about it
And now I know just what it means to be a man
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes
I never wait or hesitate 'cos I love the life I live
I'm gonna live the life I choose
You gotta understand
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues
All of my life I've had a shady reputation
I've been the black sheep of the family all along
I never know if in my heart I'm really guilty
But I've been accused of never knowin' right from wrong
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes
I never wait or hesitate 'cos I love the life I live
I'm gonna live the life I choose, yeah
You gotta understand
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues, oh yeah
My father said, You're crazy
He said, What you gonna do?
I left with my guitar and said
"I'll leave it up to you
I'm gonna live the life I love
And live the life I choose
And I'm walking in the shadow of the blues
I love the blues, they tell my story
If you don't feel it, I will tell you once again
All of my life I've been caught up in a crossfire
'Cos I've been branded with the devil mark of Cain
Everyday I realize you can see it in my eyes
I never wait or hesitate 'cos I love the life I live
I'm gonna live the life I choose, yeah
You gotta understand
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues
I'm walking in the shadow of the blues, yeahEmbed
