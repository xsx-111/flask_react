Outlaw LyricsWhen I left my home, I was not much more than a child
My mother started crying, she knew that I was born to be wild
'Cos I was looking for the bright lights of the big city
A red hot town where the girls are pretty
I took to the highway, chasing my dream down the line
Heading out for trouble, never finding my peace of mind
'Cos I been run out of town so many times before
An' usually kind of places where I can't go back no more
Outlaw
Born outside of the law
Just another outlaw
Man on the run will always take chances for fun
I never find it easy trying to keep the feeling alive
I've always been a dreamer, dreamers find it hard to survive
When they're living in the bright lights of the big city
A red hot town where the girls are pretty
Outlaw
Born outside of the law
Just another outlaw
Man on the run will always take chances for fun
Outlaw
Born outside of the law
Just another outlaw
Man on the run will always take chances for fun
Outlaw
Born outside of the law
Just another outlaw
Man on the run will always take chances for fun
Born outside of the law
Just another outlaw
Man on the run will always take chances for fun
Outlaw
Outlaw
Man on the run will always take chances for funEmbed
