Love Hunter LyricsI need a woman to treat me good
And give me everything a good woman should
Everyday and every night
She'd be waiting on her brown-eyed boy
To come and treat her right
I'm a love hunter baby
Sneaking up on you
I'm a love hunter baby
Sneaking up on you
I'm gonna give all my loving
And use my tail on you
In my time I've been a back door man
I've taken everything I could
But, I've given all I can
I don't want no woman to weep or moan
I'm looking for a sweet heart breaker
And I'm never gonna leave her alone
I'm a love hunter baby
Sneaking up on you
I'm a love hunter baby
What you gonna do?
I'm gonna give you all my loving
Steel all your love away
And use my tail on you
Ooh yeah
So that's what you want
I got what you need
I'm a love hunter baby
Sneaking up on you
I'm a love hunter baby
What you gonna do?
I'm gonna give you all my loving
Steel all your love away
And use my tail on you
Yeah, and only you
I know what I want
I always get what I need, yeah
'Cos I'm a love hunter baby
I'm a love hunter baby
I'm a love hunter baby
I'm a love hunter baby
I'm a love hunter baby
I'm a love hunter baby
Love hunter baby, mm, yeah
Love hunter baby
Love hunter baby
Love hunter baby
Love hunter baby
Love hunter baby
Every night, every day
Every night, every day
Love is all you need
Love hunter baby
I'm a love hunter baby
Love hunter baby
I'm a love hunter baby
I'm a love hunter baby
Sneaking up on you
I'm sneaking up on youEmbed
