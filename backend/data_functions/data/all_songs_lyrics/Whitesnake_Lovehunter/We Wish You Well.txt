We Wish You Well LyricsI'm sad to say it's time to go
Until we meet again along the road
Remember this on your journey home
When you hear the thunder roar, you're not alone
We wish you well, we wish you well
In times of trouble may your hearts be strong
We wish you well, we wish you well
Until we meet again, we wish you wellEmbed
