Gentle Groove LyricsLike my world I'm on fire
I am full of desire, yeah
No more preachin' on your part
No more love on my pillow, yeah
Come dance with me in my room
You can hold me hand, yeah yeah
I gonna be your boyfriend
And you can call me names, oh oh yeah
And nothings gonna change the way I feel for my love
And no one's gonna slow my gentle groove
'till kingdom come
Thy work is done
On Earth as it is in Dallas
Come play with me in my room
You can hold me hand, yeah
I gonna be your boyfriend, boyfriend
You can call me names, names
And no one's gonna take the power away, from my love
And no one's gonna change the way I feel, no way yeah yeah
And no one's gonna slow my gentle groove
'till kingdom come
Thy work is done
On Earth as it is in Dallas, come on, do it!
Oh no, no
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Here's for the whole damn, back in time, again
Back in time, yeah
Back in time, yeahEmbed
