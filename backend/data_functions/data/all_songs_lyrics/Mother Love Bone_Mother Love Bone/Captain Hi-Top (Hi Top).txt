Captain Hi-Top (Hi Top) LyricsI am magnificent!
I'm the instigator of the me generation
The official seminator of the female population baby, yeah
Scoff at my rivals, cause they ain't cool
And I re-wrote the Bible, and I made my own rules
Captain Hi-Top the love commander yeah yeah yeah
I'm the ego star forever after
Captain Hi-Top the love commander
Hide your mom, control your sister
I'm the hip-hop surgeon of the mindless eye
I said - Take me babe, in between your pretty pretty thighs
And these stories of my image ain't up to par
I'll tell you what I'll do
I slid the beast to Farah, saying babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe
Baby, I'm a star
Captain Hi-Top the love commander baby
I'm the ego star forever after
I'm talkin' 'bout Captain Hi-Top the love commander
Hide your mom, control your sister
Captain Hi-Top the love commander yeah yeah
I'm the ego star forever after
Oh Captain Hi-Top the love commander
Hide your mom, control your sister
Yeah yeah yeah
Captain Hi-Top the love commander
Hide your mom, control your sister
Can I get a halleluiah people?Embed
