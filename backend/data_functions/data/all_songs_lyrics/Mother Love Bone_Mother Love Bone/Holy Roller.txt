Holy Roller LyricsOooh baby gotta put me back together
I need your smooth dog lovin' woah, yeah
And so I'm sending off the little monster
Gonna turn it up inside your head
Do you believe?
Holy Roller
Like a holy roller
Like a holy roller
To my head
I said you loin queen parader
I won't get you down on all fours
And then you gotta show me what you're made of - little darling
I'll meet you child - by the backdoor babe
Like a holy roller
Like a holy roller
To my head
The love-bone breakdown
That's right. All right you people
See I, see I got somethin' to say to you people out there
You gotta listen to me people, you gotta listen to me
Yeeeeeah, the lord's comin' down people
Yeeeeeah he's gonna take ya whole, he's gonna eat ya whole people
Like a big grizzly bahr comin' out of the closet and eat ya whole
Ya see the lord's gonna come and get ya people and ya gotta beware
Because the Mother Love Bone camp knows what to do about it
Ya see I been around I seen a lotta long haired freaks in my day
But those boys in Mother Love Bone I'll tell ya they know what's right for ya
Ya know they're like Malt-O-Meal for ya, they're good for ya
They're like soup, they're like nothing bad, let me tell ya that much
I tell ya people, the lord's comin', and if you don't believe
And if you don't believe in what I can convey to ya, I tell ya people:
Love rock awaits ya people
Yeeeah lo and behold, lo and behold...Embed
