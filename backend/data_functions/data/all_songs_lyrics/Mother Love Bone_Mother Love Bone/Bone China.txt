Bone China LyricsIn the morning
She gone crazy
With a painted picture, yeah
Her father's story, uh-huh
A Bone China, my friends
A Bone China, let the summer come again, come again
I said oh, oh
She be dancing by the moonlit sky, I talkin' to you
Oh oh
She be drinking all my early times, yes indeed, yeah
Oh oh
She be moving like a butterfly, yeah
I'm just a-waitin' on that dream
Because the fast ones always ride for free
Ugly morning
She Jezebel's daughter, aw yeah
She like a Brunhilda
A child of the water
A Bone China, my friends
Ow, a Bone China, let the summer come again
I said, oh oh
She be dancing by the moonlit sky, I'm talking to her
Oh oh
She be moving like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Oh oh
She be shakin like the girl from Shine, yes indeed, yeah
Oh oh
She be moving like a...
She be moving like a...
High falootin' like a...
I'm just a-waiting on that dream, yeah yeah
Cause the fast ones always ride for free
I, I, I, yeah
I'm just a-waitin' on that dream
Cause the fast ones, the fast ones
Always ride for free, yeahEmbed
