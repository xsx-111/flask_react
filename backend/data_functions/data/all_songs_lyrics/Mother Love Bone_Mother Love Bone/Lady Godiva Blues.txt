Lady Godiva Blues LyricsYee-ha!
A-gidy up!
I said well
You can call me helpless
You can call me gone
Take it with my left hand
But rock an' roll and I stand on
Can't kill a tornado
I can't cut 'em at it's knee
I've been in the boat child
Yes I've seen, a dotted line
I'm fixin' on the eighties
A Lady Godiva Blues
Again
Ray of sunshine
Let me call upon my star
Take a look around baby
And see who the hell you really are
You're a mixin' on the eighties
Lady Godiva
This another year
Lady Godiva blues
How 'bout you
San Antonios, Louisiana with a Baton Rouge
Boom ba chicky chicky chicky chicky come on ma ma
Ha ha
A bring down the lights boys
I got a story to tell ya
Little mama cashus she lookin' oh so fine
Smellin' like captain crunch
And drinkin' all my wine
She playin' with juices, on the satellite TV
She drinkin' my Jack Daniels
And smoking all my reefers, yeah
I'm mixin' on the eighties
A Lady Godiva blues
I said a get it get it how 'bout you boy
San Antonios, Louisiana with a Baton Rouge
West Viginia mountain mama
She's a damn good friend of mine boy
Yes she is
The line ain't no line no line
Stony boy
Yee-ha!
Huh
Chicky chicky
Chicky chicky boom ba
Chicky chicky boom ba
Chicky chicky
A chicky chicky boom ba
Baby baby

San Antonio Texas, you're a damn good friend of mineEmbed
