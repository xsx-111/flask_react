Half Ass Monkey Boy LyricsScratching and dreaming till night turns into day
It's a surefire method to waste your life away
But me, I'm obliged to give you my disease
I'm abracadabra I do what I please
Stone cold mama - she's a bird from a feather
I focus all my energy, understanding you
Such a pretty little prancer in a burgundy blue
Witch hazel eyeballs taking care of love
Remember the key mama - understand my words
Stone cold mama - she's a bird from a feather
Half-assed monkeyboy
Half-assed monkeyboy
Half-assed monkeyboy
Half-assed monkeyboy
If you want a plate oof my beef swellington baby
You're gonna have to pay the cover charge
Open wide let me suck the gateEmbed
