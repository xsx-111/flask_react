Thru Fade Away LyricsYou can fadeaway my love I will always -
Remember your faces, thru fadeaway -
Bless all of your eyes, I realize you're my reason
And I will always cherish the days, when our souls will be together
She's my sunshine, my moonshine
She's ma' hot, ma hotma Ghandi
She's my lady, she's from Euphrates
Sure 'nuff give that woman to me
You're just another one, just another statistic
You're needle-sickness, illed weakness
Yeah, you killed, yeah you killed, yeah you killed me boyEmbed
