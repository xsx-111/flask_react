Crown of Thorns LyricsYou ever heard the story
Of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say, 'He who rides the pony must someday fall...'
Talking to my Alter
Said, 'Life is what you make it
And if you make it, death will rest your soul away... away... away'
Yeah, child
It's a broken kinda feelin'
She'd have to tie me to the ceiling
A bad moon's a-comin'
Better say your prayers, child
I want to tell you that I love you
But does it really matter?
I just can't stand to see you draggin' down again... again...
My baby, again... Oh yes
So I'm singing
This is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's unkind and leaves me alone, yes it does
This is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's unkind and leaves me alone
I used to treat you like a lady
Now you're a substitute teacher
This bottle's not a pretty, not a pretty sight
I owe the man some money
So I'm turnin' over, honey
Say Mr. Faded Glory is-a-once again a-doin' time, oh yeah
And this is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's unkind and leaves me alone, yes it does, ah
This is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's unkind and, it's unkind and
It LEAVE ME ALONE, YEAH!
Like a crown of thorns
It's all who you know
So don't burn your bridges, woman
Cause someday, yeah...
Kick it....
This is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's unkind and leaves me alone
And this is my kind of love
It's the kind that moves on
It's the kind that leaves me
Baby... I said a come on, come on, come on, come on, do it
I said baby...
Don't burn you bridges, woman...
I'm gonna come back to you...1Embed
