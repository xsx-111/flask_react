This Is Shangrila LyricsSaid I've been around the world
Wrote a million songs
It's all a bore to me
I've slept in the gutter
And I've lied with the dogs
It never bothered me
Said the sheriff, he come too
With his little boys in blue
They've been looking for me child
But with my crystal-sheen guitar
I'm another ego star
So give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me, yeah, yeah

Get me to the stage
It brings me home again
This is Shangrila - a - aow
I'm trippin' on it now
It brings me home again
This is Shangrila - ow
Said that, I look bad in shorts
But most of us do
Don't let that bother me
I'm a football who knows who (uh huh)
And I don't believe in smack talk (uh huh)
So don't you die on me, babe
Don't you die on me
Cause love
Is all good people need
And music sets the sick ones free
Without love
No one ever grows
Nothing gonna ever sing
Because now, this is Shangrila, honey
And you have gathered for the feast
My bread is your body
The wine is blood child
Yeah, yeah,the wine is blood, babe (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
The wine is...
Give it to me, said
Get me to the stage
It brings me home again
Said this is Shangrila - a - aow
I'm trippin' on it now
It brings me home again
This is Shangrila - ow
Get me to the stage
It brings me home again
I'm trippin' on it now
It brings me home again
Oh yeahhh, yeah yeah yeahEmbed
