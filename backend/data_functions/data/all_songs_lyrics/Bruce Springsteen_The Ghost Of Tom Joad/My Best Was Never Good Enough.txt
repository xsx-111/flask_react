My Best Was Never Good Enough Lyrics
"Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has his day"
She said "Now don't say nothing
If you don't have something nice to say
The tough now, they get going
When the going gets tough"

But for you, my best was never good enough

"Now don't try for a home run, baby
If you can get the job done with a hit
Remember, a quitter never wins
And a winner never quits
The sun don't shine on a sleeping dog's ass"
And all the rest of that stuff

But for you, my best was never good enough

"If God gives you nothing but lemons
Then make some lemonade
The early bird catches the fucking worm
Rome wasn't built in a day
Now life's like a box of chocolates
You never know what you're gonna get
Stupid is as stupid does"
And all the rest of that shit
Come on, pretty baby, call my bluff
But for you, my best was never good enoughEmbed
