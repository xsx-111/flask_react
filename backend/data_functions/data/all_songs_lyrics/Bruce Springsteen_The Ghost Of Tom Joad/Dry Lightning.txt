Dry Lightning Lyrics
I threw my robe on in the morning
Watched the ring on the stove turn red
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee
Pulled on my boots and made the bed

Screen door hanging off its hinges
Kept banging me awake all night
As I look out the window
The only thing in sight

Is dry lightning on the horizon line
Just dry lightning and you on my mind

I chased the heat of her blood like it was the holy grail
Descend, beautiful spirit, into the evening pale
Her appaloosa's kicking in the corral, smelling rain
There's a low thunder rolling across the mesquite plain

But it's just dry lightning on the horizon line
It's just dry lightning and you on my mind
I'd drive down to Alvarado Street
Where she'd dance to make ends meet
I'd spend the night over my gin
As she'd talk to her men
Well, the piss yellow sun
Comes bringing up the day
She said "Ain't nobody can give nobody
What they really need anyway"
Well, you get so sick of the fighting
You lose your fear of the end
But I can't lose your memory
And the sweet smell of your skin

It's just dry lightning on the horizon line
Just dry lightning and you on my mindEmbed
