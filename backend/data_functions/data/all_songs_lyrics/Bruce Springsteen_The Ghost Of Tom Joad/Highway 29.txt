Highway 29 Lyrics
I slipped on her shoe, she was a perfect size seven
I said "There's no smoking in the store, ma'am."
She crossed her legs and then we made some small talk
That's where it should have stopped
She slipped me her number, I put it in my pocket
My hand slipped up her skirt, everything slipped my mind
In that little roadhouse on Highway 29

It was a small town bank, it was a mess
Well, I had a gun, you know the rest
Money on the floorboards
Shirt was covered in blood and she was crying
Her and me we headed south on Highway 29

In a little desert motel, the air was hot and clean
I slept the sleep of the dead, I didn't dream
I woke in the morning, washed my face in the sink
We headed into the Sierra Madres across the borderline
The winter sun shot through the black trees
I told myself it was all something in her
But as we drove, I knew it was something in me
Something that had been coming for a long, long time
And something that was here with me now on Highway 29
The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline
She wasn't saying nothing, it was just a dream
The wind come silent through the windshield
All I could see was snow and sky and pine
I closed my eyes and I was running
Yeah, I was running, then I was flying1Embed
