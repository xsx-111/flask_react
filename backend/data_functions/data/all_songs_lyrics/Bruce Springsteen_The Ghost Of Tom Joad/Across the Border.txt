Across the Border Lyrics
Tonight, my bag is packed, tomorrow I'll walk these tracks
That will lead me across the border
Tomorrow, my love and I will sleep beneath auburn skies
Somewhere across the border

We'll leave behind, my dear, the pain and sadness we found here
And we'll drink from the Bravo's muddy waters
Where the sky grows gray and wide, we'll meet on the other side
There across the border

For you, I'll build a house high upon a grassy hill
Somewhere across the border
Where pain and memory, pain and memory have been stilled
There across the border

Sweet blossoms fill the air, pastures of gold and green
Roll down into cool, clear waters
And in your arms 'neath open skies, I'll kiss the sorrow from your eyes
There across the border

Tonight we'll sing the songs and I'll dream of you, my coraz√≥n
And tomorrow my heart will be strong
May the saints' blessings and grace carry me safely into your arms
There across the border
For what are we without hope in our hearts
That someday we'll drink from God's blessed waters?
And eat the fruit from the vine, I know love and fortune will be mine
Somewhere across the borderEmbed
