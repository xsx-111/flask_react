Bone Broke Lyrics
Hey, hey!
Look closer and you can see how I been running it
I got a dollar bill in the cockpit
Surprised being white is a black hole
I got another job at the liquor store, damn
Oh well, I'm bone broke

They got a white pony in the stable
And ride him when the doggie isn't able
But he don't really care because they pay him
But still a black suit is going to shake him down
Oh well I'm bone broke
Yeah, broke as I'll ever be

Look another way girl, I'm telling ya
God gave seven minutes right to ya
And your mother put her money into platinum
And now you never have to pay attention
Do ya? Do ya?

Yeah
I'm leaning on a brick with my nails
I'm sending in the money's in the mail
Keep showing that my bones never fake it
But now the brick bank is gonna break it down
Oh well, I'm bone broke
Look another way girl I'm telling ya
God gave seven minutes right to ya
Your mother put her money into platinum
So that you wouldn't have to pay attentionEmbed
