Tennessee Border Lyrics
Her eyes were blue, her hair was auburn
Her smile was like an angel fair
She was her daddy's only daughter on the tennessee border

One night, i took a ride just across that line
I picked her up in a pickup truck
And she broke this heart of mine
Her mama said: "no, she's my only daughter"
But we got married on the tennessee border

The roses were blooming on the border
And the moon was shining over there
And her personality made me want her on the tennessee border

One night, i took a ride just to pass the time
I picked her up in a pickup truck
She broke this heart of mine
Her mama said: "no, she's on the corner"
We got married on the tennessee borderEmbed
