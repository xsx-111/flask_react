Little Cream Soda Lyrics
One, two, three, four!

Well, every highway that I go down
Seems to be longer than the last one that I knew about
Oh well
And every girl that I walk around
Seems to be more of an illusion than the last one that I found
Oh well
And this old man in front of me wearing canes and ruby rings
Is like containing an explosion when he sings
With every chance to set himself on fire
He just ends up doing the same thing

Well, each beautiful thing I come across
Tells me to stop moving and shake this riddle off
Oh well
And there was a time when all I wanted
Was my ice cream colder and a little cream soda
Oh well, oh well
And a wooden box and an alley full of rocks
Was all I had to care about
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Now my mind is filled with rubber tires and forest fires
And whether I'm a liar
And lots of other situations where I don't know what to do
At which time God screams to me
"There's nothing left for me to tell you
Nothing left for me to tell you
Nothing left"

Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well1Embed
