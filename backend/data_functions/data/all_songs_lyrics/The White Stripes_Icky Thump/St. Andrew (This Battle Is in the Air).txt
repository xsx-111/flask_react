St. Andrew (This Battle Is in the Air) Lyrics
This battle is in the air
I'm looking upwards
Where are the angels?
I'm not in my home
St. Andrew don't forsake me
St. Andrew
Don't forsake me
Who is here to greet me?
The children are kind
I'm not in my home
I travel backwards in ecstasy
Where are the angels?
Don't forget me
St. Andrew
I've been true
What do I need to say?
What do I need to say?Embed
