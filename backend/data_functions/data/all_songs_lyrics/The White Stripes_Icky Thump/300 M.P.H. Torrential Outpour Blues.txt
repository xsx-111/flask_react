300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues Lyrics
I'm bringing back ghosts
That are no longer there
I'm getting hard on myself
Sitting in my easy chair
Well, there's three people in the mirror
And I'm wondering which one of them I should choose
Well, I can't keep from laughing
Spitting out these 300 mile per hour out-pour blues

I'm breaking my teeth off
Trying to bite my lip
There's all kinds of red-headed women
That I ain't supposed to kiss
And it's that color which never fails
To turn me blue
So I just swallow it and hold on to it
And use it to scare the hell out of you

I have a woman
Says come and watch me bleed
And I'm wondering just how I can do that
And still give her everything that she needs
Well, there's three people in my head that have the answer
And one of them has got to be you
But you're holding tight to it, the answer
Singing these three hundred mile per hour outpour blues
Put on gloves, a tied scarf and wrap up warm
On this winter night
Every time you get defensive
You're just looking for a fight
It's safe to sing somebody out there's got a problem
With almost anything you'll do
Well, next time they stab you don't fight back just play the victim
Instead of playing the fool

And the roads are covered with a million
Little molecules
Of cigarette ashes and the school floors are covered
With pieces of pencil eraser too
Well sooner or later the ground's gonna be holding all
Of my ashes too
But I can't help but wonder if after I'm gone will I still have these three hundred mile per hour, finger breaking, no answers making, battered dirty hands, bee stung and busted up, empty cup torrential outpour blues

One thing's for sure: in that graveyard
I'm gonna have the shiniest pair of shoes5Embed
