Icky Thump Lyrics
Ah, icky thump, who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well, what a chump
Well, my head got a bump when I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita looking dead
Came and said, "Need a bed?" in Español
I said, "Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar, and I don't need a microphone"
Icky thump with a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat, and I was freaking, I was ready to go
And I swear besides the hair she had one white eye
One blank stare, looking up, lying there
On the stand near her hand was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

White Americans, what? Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too
Who's using who? What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too
Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind, looked around, and there was nobody else
Left alone, I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how to clean up after myself14Embed
