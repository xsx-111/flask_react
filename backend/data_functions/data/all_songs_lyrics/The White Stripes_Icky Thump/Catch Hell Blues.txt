Catch Hell Blues Lyrics
If you go looking for hot water—don't act shocked when you get—burned a little bit
If you really want some hot water—I can help you find it
Ohhhhh, ohh!
Ohhhhh, ohh!
Ahhhhh, ahhhhh-ahh!

Well if they catch me around, you're playing 'rock the boat'
I'm gonna catch hell
And if you're throwing your voice
In bed singing a note
I'm gonna catch hell
I know it
Yes, sir
Try and catch me
Wha'!
Ohhhhh—oh!

Tricky, tricky
Yeah
Ohhhh! Ohhh, ohhhh!

If you're getting tricky, lying to yourself
You're gonna catch hell
And if you're testing God, lying to his face
You're gonna catch hell
Come on
Hey
That's it
They're gonna catch you
Huh-ho, they're gonna catch you
