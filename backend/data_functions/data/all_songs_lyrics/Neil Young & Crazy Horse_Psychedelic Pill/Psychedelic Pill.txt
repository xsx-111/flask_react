Psychedelic Pill LyricsParty girl's got her shiny dress on
Look at those party moves
She's looking for a good time
She loves to dance and she loves the action
Wherever the party goes
(Chorus)
You're never going to see a tear in her eye
Never see her break a frown
(Chorus)
The way she dances makes my world stand still
And she's spinning in the sky
Every move is like a psychedelic pill
From a doctor I can't buy
(Chorus x6)Embed
