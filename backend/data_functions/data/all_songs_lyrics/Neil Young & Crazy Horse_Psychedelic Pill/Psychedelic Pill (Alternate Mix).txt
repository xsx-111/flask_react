Psychedelic Pill (Alternate Mix) LyricsParty girl's got her shiny dress on look at those party moves
She's lookin' for a good time
She loves to dance and she loves the action wherever the party goes
She's lookin' for a good time
You're never gonna see a tear in her eye never see her break a frown
She's lookin' for a good time
The way she dances makes my world stand still and she's spinning in the sky
Every move is like a psychedelic pill from a doctor I can't find
I can't find, I can't find
Lookin' for a good time (lookin' for a good time)
(Just lookin' good time)
Lookin' for a good time (Just lookin' for good time)
(Just lookin' for good time)
Lookin' for a good time (lookin' for good times)Embed
