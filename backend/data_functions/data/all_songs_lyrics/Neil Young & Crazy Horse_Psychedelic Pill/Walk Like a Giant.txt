Walk Like a Giant LyricsI used to walk like a giant on the land
Now I feel like a leaf floating in a stream
I wanna walk like a giant
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
Me and some of my friends
We were gonna save the world
We were trying to make it better
We were ready to save the world
But then the weather changed
And the white got stained
And it fell apart
And it breaks my heart
But think about how close we came
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
Tried to head for long and straight
We were riding on the desert wind
We were pulling in the spiritual
Riding on the desert wind
We could see it in the distance
Getting closer every minute
We saw the lights and spiritual shining
Getting closer every minute
Then we skipped the rails
And we started to fail
And we folded up
And it's not enough
Think about how close we came
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
Whenever I see the big fire coming
Coming to burn down all my ideas
I try to hold on to my thinking
And remember how it feels
When I'm looking right in your eyes
And hearing your happy laughter
When I'm seeing your blue eyes shining
And hear your happy laughter
So the moment came
And the big sky rained
And it put out the fire
Except in my desire
When I think about how good it feels
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
I wanna walk like a giant on the land
I used to walk like a giant on the land
Now I feel like a leaf floating in a stream
I wanna walk like a giant
I wanna walk like a giant on the land1Embed
