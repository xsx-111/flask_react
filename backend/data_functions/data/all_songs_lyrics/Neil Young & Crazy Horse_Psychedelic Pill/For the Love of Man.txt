For the Love of Man LyricsFor the love of man
Who could understand what goes on
What is right and what is wrong
Why the angels cry, and the heavens sigh
When a child is born to live
But not like you or I
Let the angels ring the bells
In the holy halls
May they hear the voice that calls to them
For the love of man, who will understand
It's alright
I know it's alright
Down the dusty road
To the forest church. Let me wander there
Let me wonder why
On the ocean wave. In the billowing sky
Let me wander there
Let me wonder why
Let the angels ring the bells
In the holy halls
May they hear the voice that calls to them
For the love of man, who will understand
It's alright
But I wonder why
I wonder why
I wonder whyEmbed
