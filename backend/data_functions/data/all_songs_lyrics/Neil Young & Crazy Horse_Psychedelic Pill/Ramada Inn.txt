Ramada Inn LyricsSo many years now together?
All those good times, ups and downs
So many joys raising up those kids
Well they've moved on now, out of town
So many times she tried
So many times she cried
Every morning comes the sun
And they both rise into the day
Holding on to what they've done
She loves him so
She loves him so
She loves him so
She does what she has to
She loves him so (x3)
She does what she needs to
In a Ramada Inn near the grapevine
They stop to rest for the night
Traveling down south looking for good times
Visiting old friends feels right
People they haven't seen him forever
Since high school, Santa Jose times
Restaurant food and the bottle
Had a few drinks
Now they're feeling fine
Every morning comes the sun
And they both rise to the day
Holding on to what they've done
(Chorus)
Seem like lately things are changing
Seems like lately things are going south
A few drinks now and she hardly knows him
He just looks away and he checks out
And when she says it's time for him to do something
Maybe talk to his old friends who gave it up
He just pours himself another tall one
Closes his eyes and says that's enough
Every morning comes the sun
And they both rise to the day
Holding on to what they've done
(Chorus)
Every morning comes the sun
And they both rise to the day
Holding on to what they've done
(Chorus)Embed
