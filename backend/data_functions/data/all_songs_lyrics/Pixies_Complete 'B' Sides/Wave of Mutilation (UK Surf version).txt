Wave of Mutilation (UK Surf version) LyricsCease to resist, giving my goodbye
Drive my car into the ocean
You'll think I'm dead, but I sail away
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
Wave
I've kissed mermaids, rode the El Ni√±o
Walked the sand with the crustaceans
Could find my way to Mariana
On a wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
Wave
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave of mutilation
Wave
