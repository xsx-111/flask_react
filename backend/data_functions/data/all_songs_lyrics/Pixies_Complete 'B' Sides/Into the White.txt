Into the White Lyrics
And there ain't no night
Did you hear what I said?
But into white
Into the white

And there ain't no day
And there ain't no night
And there ain't no day
And there ain't no night
Into the white

Did you hear what I said?
Deeper than your sleepy head
Ain't nothing to see
Ain't nothing in sight
Into the white

Go and you'll go real far
Just past the big quasar
Can't hitch a meteorite
Into the whiteEmbed
