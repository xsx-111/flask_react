Make Believe Lyrics
I've been lost
Since she's gone
The piano
She's really on

I don't want you to
Marry me
Make believe
You're Debbie G

Come look down on
Who you are
She is love
With a voice
And a shape that's my guitar

I don't want you
You want me
Make believe
You're Debbie G

Make believe
You're Debbie G
Make believe
You're Debbie GEmbed
