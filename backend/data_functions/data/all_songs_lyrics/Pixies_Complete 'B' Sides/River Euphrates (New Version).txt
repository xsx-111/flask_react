Stuck here out of gas
Out here on the Gaza Strip
From driving in too fast
Two, three, let's
Ride a tire down river Euphrates, let's
Ride a tire down
Ride a tire down river Euphrates, let's
Ride a tire down
Ride a tire down river Euphrates, let's
Ride a tire (down)

Dead sea make it float
One sip from the salty wine
Dead sea make you choke
Two, three, let's
Ride a tire down river Euphrates, let's
Ride a tire down
Ride a tire down river Euphrates, let's
Ride a tire down
Ride a tire down river Euphrates, let's
Ride a tire (down)
