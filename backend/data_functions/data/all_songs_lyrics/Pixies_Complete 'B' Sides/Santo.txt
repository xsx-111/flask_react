Santo Lyrics
By the old seaside
Ain't no place far to go, I don't know
I don't know, ain't no place far to go
It's a dollar, she say

Te amo le mas
Te amo le mas

Hey you boy, how ya' doing?
Come here, boy
Here she come a-slithering
Here she come a-slithering

Te amo le mas
Te amo le mas

Buzzard eels, buzzer bikinis
Eat your rouge, a chini weinies
A warm gardeda, da' mamacita
Duh, a pouting grandma
In a corner, a-passing time

Hey, hey, praying to far to
