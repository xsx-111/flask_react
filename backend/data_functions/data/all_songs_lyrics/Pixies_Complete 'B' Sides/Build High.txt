Build High Lyrics
Build high, build high
Build high, build high

'Cause my old man is bleeding
And my poor dog needs feeding
And this time I'm really broke
So let me feel your leg of hope around me

Build high, build high
Build high, build high
I said build high, yeah, build high
Build high, build high
Build high, build high

Hold me up with pride
Cause I'm not beautiful and
I don't have no pretty friends, can't pretend
I'm tired of believing in the things that go on here
Lately it makes me feel just like I'm forming in the air air air

Build high, build high
Build high, build high
I said build high, yeah, build high
Build high, build high
Build high, build highEmbed
