The Thing LyricsI was driving doing nothing
On the shores of Great Salt Lake
When they put it on the air
I put it in the hammer lane
I soon forgot myself
And I forgot about the brake
I forgot about all laws
And I forgot about the rain
They were talking on the 9
And all across the amy band
Across the road they were turning around
And headed south with me
It got so crowded on the road
I started driving in the sand
My head was feeling scared
But my heart was feeling free
The desert turned to mud
It seems that everybody heard
Everybody was remembering
To forget they had the chills
And I heard the voices on a broadcast
From up on the bird
They were getting interviewed
By some good man whose name was Bill
I'm almost there to Vegas
Where they're puttin' on a show
They've come so far
I've lived this long, at least
I must just go and say hello1Embed
