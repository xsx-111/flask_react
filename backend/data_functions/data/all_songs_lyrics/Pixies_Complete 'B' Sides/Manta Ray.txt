Manta Ray Lyrics
All in a day
All for me
Trek across the space
It'll be just like they say

Oo, oo
Oo, oo
Yeah

Since I am told
Month number three
He has no memory
Of flyers in the night

Oo, oo
Oo, oo
Yeah

They went away
They went away
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
Police they say
My mother too
A fish from ocean blue
Above my head tonight

Oo, oo
Oo, oo
Yeah

There is a way
There is a way
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right
My manta ray is all right (all right)
My manta ray is all right (all right)
My manta ray is all right (all right)
My manta ray is all right (all right)
My manta ray is all right (all right)Embed
