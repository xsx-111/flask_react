Weird at My School Lyrics
One, two, three, four

My father lives in Arabia
And I live right here at my school
I took his plane to Colombia
So I could sell at my school

It's weird at my school

My mother's glad that I am here
So she can visit my school
I can't believe she's so pretty
I'm a son of a bitch at my school


And my best friend, my cousin Eleanor
She lives far away from the doors of my school
And often times, you know I fantasize
That I have sex with the nuns at my school
