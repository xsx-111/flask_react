Rock Is My Life, and This Is My Song LyricsIt's a hurried up life
But it's the life I choose
No use in asking me to slow down
Cause I got nothing to lose
But time and time is all I've got
You know I born standing up with a guitar in my hand
I'm not trying to come on like hollywood
But hollywood is what I am
When we come into a new town
Everybody's there
When we play our music
Hands are in the air
When the music's over
You wonder where we are
I'm standing in the silence
With my old guitar
Rock is my life and this is my song
It's a crying shame
That some of us have not survived
No use in asking how it happened
But very few are left alive
I just wanna keep on makin' music
We gotta keep on keepin' on
You're only as good as your last record
I know that someday we'll be gone, gone
When we come into a new town
Everybody's there
When we play our music
Hands are in the air
When the music's over
You wonder where we are
I'm standing in the silence
With my old guitar
Rock is my life and this is my song
When we come into a new town
Everybody's there
When we play our music
Candles light the air
When the music's over, over
You wonder where we are
I'm standing in the silence
With my old guitar, my only friend
Rock is my life and this is my song1Embed
