Second Hand LyricsNo reason to get excited
But I feel a change blowin' in the wind
Everythin's filled with confusion
So let's start the world over again
And get it second hand, slightly used, soiled
Get it second hand, carelessly abused, spoiled
I see you're looking to find new horizons
But there are footsteps everywhere you go
And somebody else has been asunder
The sunshine has wilted and crawls?
I'll get it second hand, I'm dazed and confused
Turn back the second hand, I pay all my dues
I got rid of my blues and I'm all fixed up
Watch me talk about it, wooo
Second hand, yeah used, second hand
I got it second hand, all used up
Second hand
Second hand......1Embed
