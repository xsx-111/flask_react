Julien Lyrics
Woke up this mornin', it feels like every day
I got the blues, babe, not going away
Another bad dream where you were running away
I'm forever haunted by our time
We had a moment, we had a summertime
Asked me to leave with you, but I could never decide
I've been so torn up, I've been so out of it
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night, I pray
When you coming home? Coming home?
'Cause I've been livin' for that day

Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering, "Julien"

(Ah yeah, all night, yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering, "Julien" (Julien, Julien)
To the last breath that I breathe (Julien)
I tried another to keep me satisfied
But all your colors are still dancing in my mind
More than just lovers, I
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night, I pray
When you coming home? Coming home?
'Cause I've been livin' for that day

Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering, "Julien"

(Ah yeah, all night, yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering, "Julien" (Julien, Julien)
To the last breath that I breathe (Julien)

Julien, to the last breath that I breathe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe (Julien)
I'll be whispering, "Julien"

(Ah yeah, all night, yeah, Julien, Julien)
I'll be whispering, "Julien" (Julien, Julien)
To the last breath that I breathe (Julien)
(Ah yeah, all night, yeah, Julien, Julien)
(Julien, Juliâ€”, Julien)9Embed
