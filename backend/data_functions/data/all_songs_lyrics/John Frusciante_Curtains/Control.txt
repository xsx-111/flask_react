Control LyricsIt's not the way I go
It's not the way I go
No one here hears me
I'm sick of people knowing me
Life's confusing me
So much I don't see
Something's controlling me
It's no way to live
I haven't got a thing to give
And as those signs trade off
I'm a line from loud to soft
For what I have to say
I wanted to build a stage
I wanted to feel this way
This way
All these things are real
I don't know my own field
You will prove me wrong
I don't know one
I see now what I've got
It reveals just what it's not
Some day I'll take it away
There's nothing for me anyway
Love, don't choose me
Why I don't see a thing
Why I don't see a thing
A thing
What I'm saying is now
I don't know what it's about
I wander through the dawn
So much goes on
Who will make me run?
I admit I might be wrong
These letters shelter me now
I wonder howEmbed
