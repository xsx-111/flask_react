The Past Recedes Lyrics
One, two, three, four

And then the past recedes and I won't be involved
The effort to be free, seems pointless from above
You're looking down at me, I'd rather stay below
Than have you staring up at me is nowhere I want to go

Ay, this business of how long we try to stay alive
Why to be here you first got to die so I gave it a try
And what do you know, time was so long ago

And things come back you see to where they don't belong
And every drop of sea is the whole ocean

I lied to the greatest thieves about anything and everything
I'm a figure of forgotten speech, I'm out of reach
Oh, I can't play it safe, but I might just in case


I'm disguised as a reaching hand, I'm a working man
I don't understand why clockout comes so slow everytime
That's one line I stay right behind
That's one line I stay right behind9Embed
