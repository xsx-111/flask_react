Time Tonight LyricsFor changing lines, I've got no time tonight
In these times the wind surpasses the tide
When the wake-up's hard to find
Dreams make up for your life
This crazy shine, it never lets you die
Growing up, we become what we want
Again the moon rises up too high
And we don't need the sky
Wonder what it is that makes the world turn slower
Wonder what it is that makes me feel so mad
Everyone that talks to me I so wish wouldn't
I wouldn't even care except I feel so bad
I feel so bad
Why is there no one in my life
Time
There's no time tonight
Wide
There's no room to see wide
Time
There's no time tonight
There's no one in my lifeEmbed
