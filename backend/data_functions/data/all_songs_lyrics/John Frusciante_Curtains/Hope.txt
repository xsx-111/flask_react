Hope LyricsI feel the hope running low
We never found our way home
There is no more world, the land is gone
Water is all that survived that one
There are no escapes, no escapes, no escapes
Gone are the days of mistakes, of mistakes
And did you see the night wore on
And became the days that never begun?
The disappearing days, you know where I'm from
Is the only place that forever stays young
Lost at sea, we're lost at sea
I wouldn't know my face if you all were me
All we have is all we see
There is no more hope, there are no dreams2Embed
