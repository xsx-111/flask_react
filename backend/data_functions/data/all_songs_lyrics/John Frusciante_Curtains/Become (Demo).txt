Become (Demo) Lyrics
One, two, three

I say become, but I run
And I run
You don't see me switching eyes
When I change my mind

It's easy to love
When your whole life's an act
You make what you can up
And someone else makes up the rest

Lies
You don't know how real you are
Oh, disguise
You're the real person
Whoa, lies
You don't know how real you are, oh
Oh, disguise
You're the real person
You know nothing's real
At some point in your life
When I saw that, I saw it more clear
Than anything I'd seen with my eyes
You don't remember
But, once you recalled
Feeling a way that don't agree with it all

Truth
You don't know how fake you are
Whoa, truth
You don't know how fake you are
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Oh, truth
You don't know how fake you are, oh
Oh, truth
You don't know how fake you are
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Badapa
Badapa, badapa
Positive proof
Doesn't mean what you're proving is true
Positive proof
Doesn't mean what you're proving is true
Positive proof
Doesn't mean what you're proving is true
Positive proof
Doesn't mean what you're proving is true1Embed
