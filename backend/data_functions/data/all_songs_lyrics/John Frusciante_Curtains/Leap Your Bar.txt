Leap Your Bar LyricsHannah go leap your bar
This is how right you are
I'm in a way it seems
People are cold and mean
In the valleys noon
The things that I can find
Nothing simple soon
This stitches I can time
I was so bad
I was so bad
Endless the weeds you blink
Nothing's for sure to sink
I closed an open door
What is the world good for
The beloved cars
That went to where they went
Did they actually go
Or were they really sent
Life is so sad
Life is so sad
Hannah go fill your jar
This isn't right
You are
When does the whole of to be
Become infinity
Headed for the moon
The mission I can buy
Forever in a line
The friends who walk right by
And never see you
I never see you1Embed
