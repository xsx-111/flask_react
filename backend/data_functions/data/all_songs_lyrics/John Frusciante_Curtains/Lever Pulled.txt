Lever Pulled LyricsYou're the feeling of hurting
More is what I'm asking for
Little lies cross overboard
Wait for the crying
Love to aim at besides
Lever pulled
Go where you are little pond
Never be seen by your saw
We'll work it out
Now the feelings are right where you saw
Forever is right where we were
Never be clean
Lever pulled
Be where you areEmbed
