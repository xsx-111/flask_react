A Name LyricsThese don't have a name
I've been a fool to let it out that way
And it will keep on coming back
A fool gets laughed at
And I'll go on and on and on
Letting it out when the feeling's strong
I wonder who in this single thing
Made this night and it's ugly dreams
These are paths away
It is clear that one can see through a day
And I may have met my match
Completely unattached
With no one, no one, no one
On whom to rely, let's sing that song
Well I didn't read but for the last page
You thought of me at that final stage
Eeny meeny miny mo
It's about time, 'bout time to go
(let me go)
Eeny meeny miny mo
It's about time, 'bout time
To goEmbed
