Drill (Demo) Lyrics
One more punk rock song
I really owe it to myself
One more bubble gum song
I'm gonna live it, I'm gonna give it to no one else

And when it seems to be crowded
Into the city forevermore
The same old beat won't get tired
And it will drill in to the heads of you all

All the disciples
It really was where we were at
All you original people
This world, we're gonna take it and never give it back

And when it seems to be crowded
Into the city forevermore
The same old beat won't get tired
And it will drill in to the heads of you all
Of you allEmbed
