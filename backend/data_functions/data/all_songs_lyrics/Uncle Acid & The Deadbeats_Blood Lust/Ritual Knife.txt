Ritual Knife LyricsRise up from the black smoke, eyes ablaze with fire
She's moving, she's moving
Oh I've done it again
But I'll treat you better this time
Slide across the cold floor, hide not from your sins
She's bleeding, she's bleeding
Oh I've done it again
But I'll treat you better this time
Smile, I'm your master, vile intent of love
Come closer, come closer
Oh I'll fuck you again
But I'll treat you better this time
Won't you come a little, little bit closer
Won't you come a little, little bit closer
And I'll take you and I'll hold you
There'll be no killing this time
I'll be your partner in crime
Won't you move a little, little bit faster
Won't you move a little, little bit faster
Won't you come through, I can't see you
I think I'll still take your life
You'll die by my ritual knifeEmbed
