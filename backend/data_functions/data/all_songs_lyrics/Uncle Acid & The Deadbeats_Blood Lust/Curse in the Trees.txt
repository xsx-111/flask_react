Curse in the Trees LyricsTake me through the tall black trees
And drag me through the fields
I've been sitting waiting for you here
Push me past the villagers
As they bay for my blood
You begin my torture as they cheer
I'm ready for you now
I don't feel it, the pain and suffering
Don't hear me screaming as you whip the flesh
See me crawling through the square
You wrought my skull but I'm not there
Bound and tortured for crimes of witchery
The rich man bought it now I pay the price
Burn me alive and say a prayer
My body charred but I'm not there
You, you'll fall at your knees
Death, from the curse in the trees
When I lay dead, I will rise again
I'll seek revegeance and you'll pay the price
See me watching from the trees
As I fly on through the breezeEmbed
