Down To The Fire - Bonus LyricsThere's a girl, I saw today
With sunken eyes, and a face of grey
And she was walking alone
Loose ends return
A long black cloak, and flowing hair
Red ruby rings, an icy stare
It seemed so clear to me, that she was mine
She had me under her spell
But what it was I couldn't tell
I spoke to God, asked his advice
It went unheard so I asked him twice
I heard a knocking at the door, it was the priest
So found a girl on this fine day
With sunken eyes and a face of grey, that practices witchcraft magic
Beneath the Earth
Up on the stake we must tie her
Lower her down to the fireEmbed
