13 Candles LyricsI was on the staircase by the bell
Blinded by the black magician's spell
Sorceress of death lay by my side
Rising of the blood came with the tide
13 candles, black and red set alight
13 candles black and red burning bright
I always burn black candles in the night
I began my ritual of sin
Exorcising demons from within
Casting spells of yearning and desire
We breathe in black smoke from Satan's fire
I raise up my dagger to the light
Knowingly the sorceress won't fight
I creep in from shadows cast away
And she bathes in goat's blood I hear her say
13 candles, black and red set alight
13 candles black and red burning bright
I always burn black candles in the nightEmbed
