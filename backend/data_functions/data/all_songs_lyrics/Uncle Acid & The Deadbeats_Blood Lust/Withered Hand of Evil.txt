Withered Hand of Evil LyricsThe devil took one look
Could see it in his eyes
The burning fire and sulphur smoke
Reveals him from disguise
The curtain fell at once
A man behind the wall
Smiling through the broken glass
His hand had cursed them all
The tricksters wicked ways
Deceived them all through time
Tormenting each and everyone
Too slow to the see the signs
His angel boils inside
A beast without a cage
He smashes through the world around him
Blinded by his rage
Come hold the withered hand of evil
As it guides you through the trees
Come hold the withered hand of evil
This all seeing eye that sees....Embed
