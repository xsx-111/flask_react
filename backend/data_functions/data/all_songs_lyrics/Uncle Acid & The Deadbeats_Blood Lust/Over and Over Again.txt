Over and Over Again LyricsThe rat familiar cries out
To the witch in the village
She rises up from her hideout
And screams over and over again
They couldn't kill her with fire
Although her body did burn
Left on the funeral pyre
She screamed over and over again
And through her eyes
Saw blackened skies
I don't want to know her anymore
She cast her spell on the people
Could see the pain in their eyes
From the soil to the steeple
They screamed over and over again
The blood rose up from the red lake
Crashing down on them all
Destroying all that's in its wake
They screamed over and over again
And through her eyes
Saw blackened skies
I don't want to know her anymoreEmbed
