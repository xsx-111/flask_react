Sunny Lyrics
Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain
Oh, the dark days are gone and the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true
I love you

Oh Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, oh thank you for the love you brought my way
You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true
I love you


Oh, yeah yeah
Sunny, thank you for the truth you let me see
My sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z
My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true
I love you
Whoa
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sunny, oh thank you for that smile upon your face
Sunny, thank you for that gleam that flows with grace
You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true
I love you

I love you, yeah
Yes I do
I love you2Embed
