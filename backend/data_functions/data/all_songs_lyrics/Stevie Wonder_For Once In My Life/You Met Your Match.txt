You Met Your Match Lyrics
Hey, you were good at playing the fox girl
When I was good, you threw me a bone
But I ain't playing hard for nobody
Girl just wait 'til I get you home
I'll show you the way to love somebody
Like you've never ever been shown before
Because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
Hey baby, you played the part with Jimmy and Freddie
You tried to make me look like a fool
But I took care of Cindy and Susie
Just to show you I can be twice as cruel Baby
If you want to learn how to love me
I'll teach you in my own private school
Because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
(You met your match) When you play with my affection
(You met your match) When you tried to make me walk the line
When you decided you would hurt me
That's when your grape fell off the vine
Your mama told me that I better be mellow
She said you're just a baby maybe too green
I told her Jimmy, Freddie, Teddy and Victor
They know better, mama shake off that dream
I told her that you really were cooking
My love is burning for a turn at the steam
Hey, because my love light's burning
My whole life's yearning for you
(You met your match) When you told me you loved me
(You met your match) When you told me that you wouldn't let go

(You met your match)
You met your match
You met your match
You met your match
You met your match
(You met your match) You met your match, baby
(You met your match)
You met your match
You met your match
You met your match
You met your match
(You met your match) You met your matchEmbed
