God Bless the Child Lyrics
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmmm, oh yeah

Them that's got shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the Bible says and it still is news

Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, yeah
That's got his own
Oh yeah

Yes, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade, no, no, no, no

Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, yeah
That's got his own
Oh yeah

Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding 'round your door, oh yeah
But when you're gone and spending ends
Oh, they don't come around anymore, oh yeah
Rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But please don't take too much, no, no, no

Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own, yeah
That's got his own


Oh, rich relations give
Crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But oh don't take too much, no, no, no

Mama may have, papa may have
God bless the child that's got his own, hoo
That's got his own, oh, hmm
That's got his own, yeah, hmm

I've got my own, hmm
That's got his ownEmbed
