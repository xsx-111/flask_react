Down Boys LyricsYou were tryin' to be cute
And it didn't work out
You were tryin' to be charming
And it didn't come off
You were tryin' to be clever
A big waste of time
You were tryin' to get rough
But you're waiting in line
You can't make it with the down boys
They don't hear a word you say
You can't make it with the down boys
Uh just stay out of their way
You were trying to be sharp
But they couldn't wait
You were trying to be eternal
But uh that didn't rate
You were tryin' to be smooth
You're rough on the edges
You were tryin' to be, hysterical
And I still ain't laughin'
You can't make it with the down boys
Uh they don't hear a word you say
You can't make it with the down boys
Just stay out of their way
You were tryin' to be in
But they left you out (yelp?)
You were tryin' to be in
Two different worlds
You were tryin' to be in
Oscillation in shame
You were tryin' to be in
But you're lost in the game
You can't make it with the down boys
They don't hear a word you say
You can't make it with the down boys
Uh just stay out of their way
Stay out of their way
Out of their way
You can't make it with the down boys
Uh they don't hear a word you say
You can't make it with the down boys
Just stay out of their way1Embed
