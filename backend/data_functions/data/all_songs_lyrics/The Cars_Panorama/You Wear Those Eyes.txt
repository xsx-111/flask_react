You Wear Those Eyes LyricsYou wear those eyes
That never blink
You always were
The missing link
You paint your mouth
You let me know
You really are
The only show
Just take your time
It's not too late
I'll be your mirror
You won't hesitate
I'm easy to be found
Whenever you come down
You got that walk
You do the stroll
You make me lose
My ground control
You got that look
I can't resist
Like something missing
Never kissed
Just take your time (just take your time)
It's not too late (it's not too late)
I'll be your mirror (just take your time)
So you won't hesitate
I'm easy to be found
Whenever you come down
You do the pogo
Without the bounce
You got the name
I can't pronounce
You fall in love (you fall in love)
You like the sting
You make believe (you make believe)
It's everything
Just take your time (just take your time)
It's not too late (it's not too late)
I'll be your mirror (just take your time)
So you won't hesitate
I'm easy to be found
Whenever you come down
Just take your time
It's not too late
Just take your time
It's not too late
Just take your time
It's not too late
Just take your time
It's not too late
Just take your time
It's not too late
Just take your time
It's not too late
Just take your time
It's not too late
Just take your time
It's not too lateEmbed
