Running to You LyricsI'm comin' around
I want you to come
I'm comin' arou-ound
Just for the fun
Havin' a real time
Just taking what's not mine
And I'm doin' what I want to do
That's runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
(Runnin' to you)
That's runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
That's (runnin' to you) runnin' to you
You're lookin' for someone
Maniacal shots
You're lookin' for someone
All over the top
I'm havin' a real time
Just reading your head-line
And I'm doin' just what I want to do
That's runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
(Runnin' to you) runnin' to you
That's runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
(Runnin' to you)
You're hopin' for someone
That fits in the plan
You're hopin' for someone
Two in the hand
Havin' a real time
Just taking what's not mine
And I'm doin' what I like to do
That's runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
(Runnin' to you)
A runnin' a runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
That's runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
Uh that's runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
(Runnin' to you) runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you) runnin' runnin' runnin' to you
Runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
I like runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
(Runnin' to you) runnin' runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you)
I like runnin' to you
(Runnin' to you) runnin' runnin' runnin' to youEmbed
