Getting Through LyricsI don't want to be your party doll
All flaked out in Tinsel Town
Circus mouth shooting all directions
With TV ads that sell erections
I got no clue what they want to do with you
It's just getting through, getting through to you
Living outside the misdemeanor
Some get lost and some are screamers
It's easy to tell the great pretenders
They've got the broken wings and the flip-top fenders
I got no clue what they want to do with you
It's just getting through, getting through to you
I don't want to be your suffering box
Argue art and untie those knots
I don't want to be your bad connection
Or fit into your reality vision
I got no clue what they want to do with you
It's just getting through, getting through to youEmbed
