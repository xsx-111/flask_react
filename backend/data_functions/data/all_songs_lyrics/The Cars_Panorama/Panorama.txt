Panorama LyricsI'm gonna get what's coming to me
No surprises, no impressions
Hey, what's a-wrong with you tonight?
Just sittin' on your can-can
Doin' the panoram'
With nothin' to contemplate
With nothin' to search for
With nothin' to integrate
With nothin' to do
'Cept think about you
With nothin' to do
'Cept fall for blue
I just want to be in your panorama, yeah
(Panorama)
I just want to be in your panorama
(Panorama)
I'm gonna take what's comin' to me
No entanglements and no compromise
Hey, get the picture, I'm-I'm on my knees
Lookin' at your hot shot
Turnin' down your offer
Well, I'm rippin' it up
I'm lookin' awa-ay
I'm pullin' my flag up
'Cause I'm miles away
With nothin' to do
'Cept think about you-ou, yeah
I just want to be in your panorama
(Panorama)
Well, I just want to be in your panorama
(Panorama)
I'm gonna to find my way outta here
No pushing the buttons, no deals with daddy-o
I'm gonna get myself in trouble
Gonna take my chances
If I break your bubble
Well, I'm rippin' it up
I'm lookin' away
I'm pullin' my flag up
'Cause I'm miles away
With nothin' to do
'Cept think about you
I just want to be in your panorama
(Panorama)
Said, I just want to be in your panorama
(Panorama)
Well, I just want to be in, I just want to be in
