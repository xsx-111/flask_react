Misfit Kid LyricsI dream frequently, sometimes they come out funny
I go through insanity, all they want is money
All these parties they get so habitual
The same sea of faces
Always pushin', always pullin'
Always in the races
I get cooled out
I get the come ons
I get rumbled
I get cru-u-umbled, yeah
I'm the American misfit kid
I'm still wonderin' what I did
I'm stiletto, so so sharp and I'm willin' to cut
Sometimes nebulous, well I'm ready to strut
Lost and frantic, new age romantic
I'm checkin' out the race
I never cared about what it meant
Always loved disgrace
I get rhythm
I get cornflakes
I get fast love
I get wasted, yeah
I'm the American misfit kid
Still wonderin' what I did
I'm on the inside, takin' a fast ride
(I'm on the inside, takin' a fast ride)
I dream frequently, sometimes they come out funny, ha
I live with absurdity, it's always warm and runny
And all these parties they get so ritual
Lonely hearts and aces
Always pushin', a-always pullin', always in the races
I get cooled out
I get the come ons
I get rumbled
I get cru-u-u-umbled, yeah
I'm the American misfit kid
I'm still wonderin' what I did
I'm on the inside, takin' a fast ride
I'm the American misfit kid
I'm still wonderin' what I did
I'm on the inside, takin' a fast ride
That's right
I get cooled out
I get the come ons
I get rumbled
I get cru-umbled
I get Cornflakes
Fast love, wasted2Embed
