Touch and Go LyricsAll I need is what you've got
All I'll tell is what you're not
All you know is what you hear
I get this way when you come near
Then I know it's gone too far
Uh-oh, I touched your star
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midnight
And then you said
With me, it's touch and go, oh, oh, oh
It's touch and go, oh, oh, oh
All I need is you tonight
Flying like a cement kite, yeah
In your headlock on the floor
Who could ever ask for more?
And I know it's gone too far
Uh-oh, I touched your star
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midnight
Then you said
With me, it's touch and go, oh, oh, oh
Touch and go, oh, oh, oh
All I want is you tonight
I guess that dress does fit you tight, yeah
You know that look does make me shake
It almost looks too good to fake
And I know it's gone too far
Uh-oh, I touched your star
And it felt so right
Just like the hush of midnight
Then you said
With me, it's touch and go, oh, oh, oh
Touch and go, oh, oh, oh
Well, it's touch and go, oh, oh, oh
It's touch and go, oh, oh, oh
Well, it's touch and go, oh, oh, oh
Touch and go, touch and go, whoa, yeah
Well, it's touch and go, oh, oh, oh
Touch and go, touch and go
All I need is what you've got2Embed
