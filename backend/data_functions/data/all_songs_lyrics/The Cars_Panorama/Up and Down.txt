Up and Down LyricsDo you have to be so hard to get
Especially with those emerald eyes
You might have been a neon lover
But you didn't have to advertise
Well come on, well come on
You might have been a crackshot shooter
Hung up on your figurine
Under the cold and darkly sky
You're the only light I've seen
Well come on, well come on
And it happens every time
I'm still hanging on the line
Don't want to go up and down
You don't have to be so touch
I'll tell you when I've had enough
You don't have to reek with charm
You won't have to twist my arm
Well come on, well come on
Well come on, well come on
And it happens every time
I'm still hanging on the line
Don't want to go up and downEmbed
