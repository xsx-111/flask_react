This Is the Way LyricsThis is the way
This is the only way for me
Fill your head with alcohol
Comic books and drugs
This is the way
The way
The way
Tell the world your problems
You've forsaken all you lives
Surely someone cares for you
Someone you won't despise
This is the way
The way
The way
This is the way
This is the wayEmbed
