Dream By Dream LyricsI started playing guitar at school
Then I joined a band - seemed exciting
I believe that this it
And I've got a dream today
It's a twenty story leap to what I want to say
I fell into a world opening doors on a voyage to the biggest brightest star
I just came over the hill
There's not a cloud in the sky
So many paths to choose from
And so many things to try
I just came over the hill
I just came over the hill
I just came over the hill
Well - they persuaded me
I had to leave the band
The reasons given I didn't understand
They said "Now Martin - if you really cared"
I felt I had to - I'm feeling really scared
They killed my best dream dead
They killed my best dream dead
They killed my best dream dead
Have you ever had the sort of dream where the people seem to live inside your life not quite right like a distant scream in twisted twilight haze
Give me a warm heart so my cold heart won't feel coolEmbed
