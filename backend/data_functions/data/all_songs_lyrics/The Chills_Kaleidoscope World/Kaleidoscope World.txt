Kaleidoscope World LyricsI'd look at you, and perhaps you'll smile at me
Loving my kaleidoscope world
The stars and planets just glide on by
Cold and patient like white gods' eyes
We smile a lot, loving our kaleidoscope world
It gets a bit cold so we turn on the heater
Things are great but that makes it neater
We'll never die in our kaleidoscope world
Come along baby we'll live in our kaleidoscope world
Come along baby we'll live in my kaleidoscope world (etc)
Kaleidoscope world
We go for a swim in the deep of space
A thousand colours reflect off your face
The stars surround us as we sail on through our kaleidoscope world
Don't need a red light bulb - I can see Mars
We've got a stereo and electric guitars
The sounds we make echo on through our kaleidoscope world
Like this...
If we were floating in a space capsule
I'd look at you and perhaps you'll smile at me
Loving my kaleidoscope world
Come along baby we'll live in our kaleidoscope world
Come along baby we'll live in my kaleidoscope world (etc)
