The Great Escape LyricsI sit here and wonder
I wonder what's out there
I wonder what's out there?
I hope they can hear me (3x)
Chorus
I'm making plans for the great escape
The great escape from here
I'm taking off for a better place
And better people who care
And no-one can hear me
No one can hear me (2x)
There's light and there's dark
And sometimes I just can't tell them apart
I'd rather drink a wishing well
If this is the way things are
Chorus
And no-one can hear me
No-one can hear me (3x)
No-one can see me
And no-one comes near me
No-one(4x)Embed
