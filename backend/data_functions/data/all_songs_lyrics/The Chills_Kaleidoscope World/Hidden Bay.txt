Hidden Bay LyricsI've been searching for the hidden bay
Well it's a long long way, the hidden bay
My baby's bathing in the hidden bay
Well she bathes all day in the month of May
Well it's a far far cry from the city life
And one day soon I'm going to make that baby my wife
And we'll bathe our lives away in the hidden bay
Maybe I'm a fool, a fool, a fool
Maybe I'm a fool, a fool, a fool
But baby you're so cool, so cool, so cool
Baby you're so cool, so cool, so cool
Baby you're so cool!Embed
