I Love My Leather Jacket LyricsI wear my leather jacket like a great big hug
Radiating charm - a living cloak of luck
It's the only concrete link with an absent friend
It's a symbol I can wear 'till we meet again
Or it's a weight around my neck while the owner's free
Both protector and reminder of mortality
It's a curse - I cannot shirk responsibilities
From the teacher to the pupil it's a gift to me
So I love my leather jacket and I wear it all the time
I love my leather jacketEmbed
