Frantic Drift LyricsTell me a story, tell me a story, let me drift
Tell me a story, tell me a story, let me drift
Make me think I'm not really in this place
Let your words run like summer rain down my face
Let your voice caress my mind like a loving touch
I'm not asking too much
I just don't want the worry of telling myself
Tell me a story, tell me a story, let me drift
Tell me a story, tell me a story, frantic drift
Let me rest in peace, or in pieces let me die
Just tell me I can survive - if you want to keep me alive...
Frantic drift
Frantic drift
Frantic drift
Frantic drift
And you try to tell me about Jesus and your gods
But I've heard it all before
So I try but I can't say anything new
That makes me sick but I'm still doing better than you
Frantic drift, frantic drift, frantic drift, frantic drift
Say I'll be alive in the future after the war
And tell me things will be better than before
And tell me tales of lights
And time and space
And tell me there'll be problems
I can face
I don't care if you're lying...
Tell me a story, let me drift
Tell me a story, I'm frantic let me drift
Oh tell me a story, I'm frantic let me drift
Tell me a story, let me drift
Tell me a story, I'm frantic let me driftEmbed
