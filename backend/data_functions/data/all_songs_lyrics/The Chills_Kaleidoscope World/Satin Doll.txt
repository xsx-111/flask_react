Satin Doll LyricsSatin doll
Satin doll
Satin doll
Satin doll
She was just my little satin doll
I met her down by the blossom tree
She has beauty like the moon far beyond my words
Like a sunset flock of firebirds, oh
Satin doll, satin doll, satin doll, satin doll
I can't take her no more
I can't take her no more
I can't take her no more
I can't take her no more
Satin doll, satin doll, satin doll, satin doll
Her voice disappeared over the hills
Over mountains made of blue crystal
She was just my little satin doll -
I met her down by the blossom tree
(Where is she?) In a rain forest. Satin doll
(Where is she?) In a sunny field. Satin doll
(Where is she?) Oriental garden. Satin doll
(Where is she?) In a paper temple. Satin doll
She was just my little satin doll -
I met her down by the blossom treeEmbed
