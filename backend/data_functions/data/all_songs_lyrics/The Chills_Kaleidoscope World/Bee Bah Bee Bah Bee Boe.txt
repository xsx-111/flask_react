Bee Bah Bee Bah Bee Boe LyricsI try to find my real self
Maybe on the top shelf
I was looking through an old box trying on old clothes
I put the box back though
Wasn't really my show
Bee Bah Bee Bah Bee Boe
You'd think self discovery
Was really rather easy
I mean I'm standing right here
But the real real me
Was never really clear
Bee Bah Bee Bah Bee BoeEmbed
