The Men Behind the Guns Lyrics
Let's drink a toast to the admiral
And here's to the captain bold
And glory more for the commodore
When the deeds of might are told
They stand to the deck through the battle's wreck
When the great shells roar and pound
And never they fear when the foe is near
To lay their orders down
But off with your hats and three times three
For every sailor's son
For the men below who fight the foe
The men behind the guns
Oh, the men behind the guns

Their hearts a-pounding heavy
When they swing to port once more
With never enough of the greenback stuff
They start for the leave ashore
And you'd think perhaps the blue-blouse chaps
Had better clothes to wear
For the uniforms of officers
Could hardly be compared
Warriors bold with straps of gold
That dazzle like the sun
Outshine the common sailor boys
The lads who serve the guns
Oh, the men behind the guns
But say not a word 'til the shot is heard
That tells the fight is on
And the angry sound of another round
Says there must be God
Over the deep and the deadly sweep
Of the fire and the bursting shell
Where the very air is a mad despair
The throes of a living hell
But down and deep in a mighty ship
Unseen by the midday sun
Oh, you'll find the boys who make the noise
The lads who serve the guns
Oh, the men behind the guns

And well they know the cyclone blow
Loose from the cannon's steel
And they know the hull of the enemy ship
Will quiver with the feel
And the decks will rock with the lightning shock
And shake with a great recoil
While the sea grows red with the blood of the dead
And swallows up her spoil
But not until the final ship
Has made her final run
Can we give the rest to the very best
The lads who serve the guns
Oh, the men behind the guns
So let's drink a toast to the admiral
And here's to the captain bold
And glory more for the commodore
When the deeds of might are told
They stand to the deck through the battle's wreck
When the great shells roar and pound
And never they fear when the foe is near
To lay their orders down
But off with your hats and three times three
For every sailor's son
For the men below who fight the foe
The men behind the guns
Oh, the men behind the gunsEmbed
