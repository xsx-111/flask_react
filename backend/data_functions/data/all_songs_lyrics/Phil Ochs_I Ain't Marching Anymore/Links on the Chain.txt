Links on the Chain Lyrics
Come you ranks of labor, come you union core
And see if you remember the struggles of before
When you were standing helpless on the outside of the door
And you started building links on the chain, on the chain
And you started building links on the chain

When the police on the horses were waitin' on demand
Ridin' through the strike with the pistols in their hands
Swingin' at the skulls of many a union man
As you built one more link on the chain, on the chain
As you built one more link on the chain

Then the army of the fascists tried to put you on the run
But the army of the union, they did what could be done
Oh, the power of the factory was greater than the gun
As you built one more link on the chain, on the chain
As you built one more link on the chain

And then in 1954, decisions finally made
Oh, the black man was a-risin' fast, racin' from the shade
And your union took no stand and your union was betrayed
As you lost yourself a link on the chain, on the chain
As you lost yourself a link on the chain
And then there came the boycotts and then the freedom rides
And forgetting what you stood for, you tried to block the tide
Oh, the automation bosses were laughin' on the side
As they watched you lose your link on the chain, on the chain
As they watched you lose your link on the chain

You know when they block your trucks boys, by layin' on the road
All that they are doin' is all that you have showed
That you gotta strike, you gotta fight to get what you are owed
When you're building all your links on the chain, on the chain
When you're building all your links on the chain

And the man who tries to tell you that they'll take your job away
He's the same man who was scabbin' hard just the other day
And your union's not a union 'til he's thrown out of the way
And he's chokin' on your links of the chain, of the chain
And he's chokin' on your links of the chain

For now the times are tellin' you the times are rollin' on
And you're fighting for the same thing, the jobs that will be gone
Now it's only fair to ask you boys, which side are you on?
As you're buildin' all your links on the chain, on the chain
As you're buildin' all your links on the chainEmbed
