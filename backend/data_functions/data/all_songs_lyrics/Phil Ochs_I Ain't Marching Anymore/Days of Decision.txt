Days of Decision Lyrics
Oh, the shadows of doubt are in many a mind
Lookin' for an answer they're never gonna find
But they'd better decide 'cause they're runnin' out of time
For these are the days of decision

Oh, the games of stalling you cannot afford
Dark is the danger that's knocking on the door
And the far-reaching rockets say you can't wait anymore
For these are the days of decision

In the face of the people who know they're gonna win
There's a strength that's greater than the power of the wind
And you can't stand around when the ice is growing thin
For these are the days of decision

I've seen your heads hiding 'neath the blanket of fear
When the paths they are plain and the choices are clear
Oh with each passing day, boys, the cost is more dear
For these are the days of decision

There's many a cross that burns in the night
And the fingers of the fire are pointing as they bite
Oh you can't let the smoke keep on blinding all your sight
For these are the days of decision
Now the mobs of anger are roamin' the streets
From the rooftops they're aimin' at the police on the beat
And in city after city you know they will repeat
For these are the days of decision

There's been warnings of fire, warnings of flood
Now there's the warning of the bullet and the blood
From the three bodies buried in the Mississippi mud
Sayin' these are the days of decision

There's a change in the wind, and a split in the road
You can do what's right or you can do what you are told
And the prize of the victory will belong to the bold
For these are the days of decision
Yes, these are the days of decisionEmbed
