Darkroom Lyrics
Got a place
We can go
Lights are low
Let me show you to my darkroom

Come a-come along with me to my darkroom
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom
Ah come a-come a-come a-come a-come on
Come a-come along
Cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah-cah come on
Ah

Got a place
We can go
Lights are low
Let me show you to my darkroom

Come a-come along with me to my darkroom (Got a place)
Come a-come along with me to my darkroom (We can go)
Got a place
We can go
Lights are low
Let me show you to my darkroom

Come a-come along with me to my darkroomEmbed
