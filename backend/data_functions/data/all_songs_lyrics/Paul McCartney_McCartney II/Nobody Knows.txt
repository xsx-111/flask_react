Nobody Knows Lyrics
I said nobody knows
Nobody knows

Which one of you can tell me what it is I'm looking at?
Anyone who can has got to be a crazy cat
Because I believe that nobody knows
(No nobody knows)
Yeah, nobody knows, no
(Lord, I cannot tell you)
Well, that's the way I like it
Yeah now, nobody knows

Nobody knows
Oh, nobody knows
Well Lord, you know that nobody knows

Samson and Delilah would have made a crazy pair
If that silly woman hadn't shaven off his hair
I believe that nobody knows
Yeah, nobody knows (nobody)
But that's the way I like it
Oh now, nobody knows
No, no, no, no, no
Nobody knows, nobody knows
That's the way I like it, nobody knows

I may go hungry, maybe next week
Well if I do, baby I'll still find something to eat
And you know, nobody knows
No, nobody knows
Well, that's the way I like it
Baby, nobody knows

And that includes you, honey
(Nobody knows)
I'll pay your rent
I'll do you right
(Nobody knows)
Most every night
But still there's nobody knows
No now, nobody knows
And that's the way I like to keep it
Just so nobody knowsEmbed
