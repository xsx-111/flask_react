Temporary Secretary Lyrics
Mister Marks, can you find for me
Someone strong and sweet fitting on my knee?
She can keep her job if she gets it wrong
Ah, but, Mister Marks, I won't need her long
All I need is help for a little while
We can take dictation and learn to smile
And a temporary secretary
Is what I need for to do the job
I need a

Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary

Mister Marks, could you send her quick?
'Cause my regular has been getting sick
I need a

Temporary secretary, temporary secretary

Mister Marks, I can pay her well
If she comes along and can stay a spell
I will promise now that I'll treat her right
And will rarely keep her 'til late at night
I need a
She can be a belly dancer
I don't need a true romancer
She can be a diplomat
But I don't need a girl like that
She can be a neurosurgeon
If she's doing nothing urgent
What I need's a temporary, temporary secretary
I need a, I need a

Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary

Now, Mister Marks, when I send her back
Will you please make sure she stays on the right track
Well, I know how hard it is for young girls these days
In the face of everything, to stay on the right track

She can be a belly dancer
I don't need a true romancer
She can be a diplomat
But I don't need a girl like that
She can be a neurosurgeon
If she's doing nothing urgent
What I need's a temporary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
Temporary secretary, temporary secretary
