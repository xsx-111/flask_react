One of These Days Lyrics
One of these days, when my feet are on the ground
I'm gonna look around and see
See what's right, see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after

One of these days, when a job just takes too long
I'm gonna sing my song and see
See what's right, see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after

It's there, it's round
It's to be found
By you, by me
It's all we ever wanted to be

One of these days, when we both are at our ease
When you've got time to please yourself
See what's right and see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after

It's there, it's round
It's to be found
By you, by me
It's all we ever wanted to see
One of these days, when my feet are on the ground
I'm gonna look around and see
See what's right and see what's there
And breathe fresh air ever after

Ever after
Breathe fresh air ever afterEmbed
