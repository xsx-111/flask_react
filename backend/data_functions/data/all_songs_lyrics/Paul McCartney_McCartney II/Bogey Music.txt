Bogey Music Lyrics
Everybody bogey, dig that bogey beat
Man, that bogey rhythm smells so clean and sweet
Everybody bogey, bogey on to the street
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
Everybody bogey, dig that bogey beat

If you little bogeys want to sing along
Clean your bogey act up and learn the bogey song
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
Without bogey music, life is incomplete

Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music, bogey music

Alright, here we are now
Tonight in Bogeyland

Bogey music, bogey music
Well, when the younger bogeys hear that bogey sound
Every little bogey got to bogey down
Bogey, man, bogey
Bogey, man, bogey
Bogey, man, bogey on down

Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music
Bogey, man, bogey on down
Bogey music

All you little bogeys, I want you to sing along
Clean your bogey act up and learn the bogey song
Without bogey music, life is incomplete
You know it is, suckers

Bogey music, bogey music
Bogey music, bogey musicEmbed
