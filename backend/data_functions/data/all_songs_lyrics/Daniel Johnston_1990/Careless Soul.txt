Careless Soul LyricsCareless soul, oh, heed the warning
For your life will soon be gone
Oh, how sad to face the judgment
Unprepared to meet your God
Careless soul, why will you linger?
Wandering from the throne of God
And your life is spent in folly
Oh, prepare to meet your God
Careless soul, oh, heed the warning
For your life will soon be gone
Oh, how sad to face the judgment
Unprepared to meet your God
Hear you not the earnest pleadings
Of your friends that wish you well?
And perhaps before tomorrow
Youâ€™ll be called to meet your God
Careless soul, oh, heed the warning
For your life will soon be gone
Oh, how sad to face the judgment
Unprepared to meet your God2Embed
