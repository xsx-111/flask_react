Some Things Last a Long Time Lyrics
Your picture is still
On my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright
Bright, as ever

The red is strong, the blue is pure
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still
On my wall, on my wall
I think about you
Often, often

I won't forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

It's funny, but it's true
And it's true, but it's not funny
Time comes and goes, but all the while
I still think of you
Some things last a long time

Your picture is still
On my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright
Bright, as ever

The things we did, I can't forget
Some things last a lifetime
Some things last a lifetime
Some things last a lifetime
Some things last a lifetime2Embed
