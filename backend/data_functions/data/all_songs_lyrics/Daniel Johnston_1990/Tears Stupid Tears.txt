Tears Stupid Tears Lyrics
Time is a matter of fact
And it's gone and it'll never come back
And mine, it's wasted all the time
Tears, stupid tears, bring me down

I got lucky by coincidence
But I got my feelings bent
And my head looking at the ground
Tears, stupid tears, bring me down

How could you know that's where the wind blows?
Out to the wind, that's where my love goes
And it brings me down
Tie my brain into a knot
Those tears, stupid tears, bring me down

I know that I have a friend
He stays with me all day long
He knows and I walk in his shell
I was born in the body and right from the start
Those tears, stupid tears, been tearing us apart
How could I know that's where the wind blows
Out to the wind that's where my love goes
And it brings me down
Tie my brain into a knot
Those tears, stupid tears, bring me down2Embed
