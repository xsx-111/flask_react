Got to Get You Into My Life LyricsI was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Then I suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
Got to get you into my life
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
You were meant to be near me
And I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do? What can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Then I suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
Got to get you into my life
Got to get you into my lifeEmbed
