Devil Town Lyrics
I was livin' in a devil town
Didn't know it was a devil town
Oh, lord, it really brings me down
About the devil town

And all my friends were vampires
Didn't know they were vampires
Turns out I was a vampire myself
In the devil town

I was livin' in a devil town
Didn't know it was a devil town
Oh, lord, it really brings me down
About the devil town2Embed
