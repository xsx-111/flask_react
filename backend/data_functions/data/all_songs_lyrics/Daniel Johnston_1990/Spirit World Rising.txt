Spirit World Rising Lyrics
I have been to Abilene
The spirit world rising
I have seen in Abilene
The Devil has Texas

Purple robes they shall wear
The spirit world rising
The number on their forehead and hands
The Devil has Texas

From the sky the number seven
The Devil defeated
In the sky
The New Jerusalem

I have been to Abilene
The spirit world rising
I have seen in Abilene
The Devil has Texas

The Spirit World Rising
The Devil has Texas
The Spirit World Rising
The Devil has Texas
The Spirit World Rising
The Devil has Texas
The Spirit World Rising
The Devil has Texas2Embed
