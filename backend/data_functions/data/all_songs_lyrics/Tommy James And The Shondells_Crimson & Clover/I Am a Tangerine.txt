I Am a Tangerine LyricsHello banana, I am a tangerine
Is it a dream? Oh, no! I don't think so, but
My head is spinning, I am a carousel
Don't-cha hear the bells ringin' in my ear?
And I haven't any troubles
Cause the friendly, friendly bubbles wash them away
I am so mellow, I am a jello man
Yes I am and nothing touches me
Oh, no, I think it's over
For the fire's gettin' lower, I'm fallin' down
Hello banana, I am a tangerine. (repeat and fade)Embed
