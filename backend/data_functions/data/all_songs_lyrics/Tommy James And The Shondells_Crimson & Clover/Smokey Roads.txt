Smokey Roads LyricsRoamin' down smokey roads
I'm roamin' down lonely roads
I came back to take a look at my childhood
But all I found was a big stack of plywood
And a whole bunch of people I don't even know, uh-huh
Roamin' down smokey roads
I'm roamin' by lonely roads
Ain't it funny how you wanna come back again
To the old home town that you left when you were ten
And maybe even bump into an old time friend?
(Spoken) Ain't nothin' here for me
Roamin' down smokey roads
Mm, I'm stollin' down smokey roadsEmbed
