Kathleen McArthur LyricsI work for the father of Kath-a-leen McArthur
So respectable, so refined
I tend to the garden, I then clean the yard
And straighten up the "No trespassing" sign
Oh, they've got a fishing yacht and a limousine
And a very lovely daughter, Kath-a-leen
In a house that's fit for twenty, there they sit with plenty
Independently, high society
Every morning when I meet her, I tip my hat to greet her
"Well hello, Kathleen, how are you today?"
Kathleen, so serene, Daddy's unaware
Of the mask you wear, and the love we share
Yes, I work for the father of Kath-a-leen McArthur
So respectable, so refinedEmbed
