Breakaway LyricsNow, now, now, I know how you feel inside
Someone you love took you for a ride
You better tell him it's all over
Girl, you know that I'll be standin' by, yes, I will
Better hear what I say, uh-huh
Breakaway
Baby, you know he ain't no good for you
That he don't love you the way I do
Can't you see you'll get hurt now?
That he can't give you love that he don't have? No, no
Girl, it's better this way, come on
Breakaway, baby
Now, now, if you ever need a helping hand
Turn around, baby, here I am
Now, I've been lovin' you such a long time
Watchin' you throw your sweet, sweet love away, uh-huh
Better hear what I say, uh-huh
Breakaway
Hey!
Come on baby
You got to hear me, babe, come breakaway
You got to hear me now, so breakaway!
C'mon, yeah!
Hey!Embed
