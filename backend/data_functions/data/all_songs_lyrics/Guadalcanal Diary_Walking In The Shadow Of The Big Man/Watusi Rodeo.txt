Watusi Rodeo LyricsCome along with me to the Congo land
Got a zebra by the tail and a python in my hand
Once my home was a Texas plain
But now I swing a lasso on an alien terrain
Hottentots and pygmies know where to go
Everybody's heading for the Watusi rodeo
Cowboys are putting up a big fence around
A sacred elephant burial ground
Native women stomping up a flurry in the mud
Villagers are looking for some cowboy blood (Blood!)
I guess they didn't like them hats we made 'em wear
They don't look right on the native hair
Don't they know that it's all for show
All for showing at the Watusi rodeo
Monkeys in the trees just thumbing their nose
At the bullriders riding on rhinos
Warriors standing with spears in their hands
Wondering what's next from the crazy white man
Natives are restless underneath Stetsons
What are these cowboys doing in the Congo?
Look like cows but they're water buffaloes
Ropin' and a riding in the Watusi rodeo
Oh they look like cows but they're water buffaloes
Everybody's heading for the Watusi rodeoEmbed
