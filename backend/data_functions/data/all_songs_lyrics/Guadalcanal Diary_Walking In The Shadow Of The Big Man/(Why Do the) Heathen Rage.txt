(Why Do the) Heathen Rage LyricsFallen idol keep me sane, bless me for my righteous ways
Manacled by fates decree, salvation for the sane
Many rise up in his name, strike the proper page
Why do the heathen rage?
Trust a man of unknown origin, paraclete with shifty eyes
When the Jews return to Zion and the comet rips the skies
May rise up in his name, strike the proper page
Why do the heathen rage?
But for the grace of God, there go you and I
History will be repaid when judgment burns on every page
Why do the heathen rage?
May rise up in his name strike the proper page
Why do the heathen rage?Embed
