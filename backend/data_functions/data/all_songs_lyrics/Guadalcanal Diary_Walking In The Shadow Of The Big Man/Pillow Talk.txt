Pillow Talk LyricsLittle things you whisper in your sleep
Try to tell me they don't mean a thing
All just bad dreams
I know it's not your fault I still hear pillow talk
I listen to you talking in the dark
I listen though it only breaks my heart
You've gone too far
I know it's not your fault, it still hurts, pillow talk
You speak a foreign language when you sleep
Mention every guy in town but me
Seems like common courtesy that
You'd just once in a while, please please, you'd mention me
Slumber time is quickly drawing near
Lie awake with fingers in my ears
All out of fear
I know it's not your fault, I still hear pillow talk Pillow talk
County fairs and cake walks and nervous smiles and boys and pillow talkEmbed
