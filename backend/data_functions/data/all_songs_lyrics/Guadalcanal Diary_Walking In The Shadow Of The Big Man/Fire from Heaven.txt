Fire from Heaven LyricsHer eyes look up with tears of dust
Her breath all smoke, she left hanging
She heard a voice that came so near
A lowly life in darkest night
All the power of heaven
No moon on nights like this
Two hands reach up...
Nothing...nothing...nothing but the fire
These rooms where she had moved
A life all squeezed into these walls
She gazed out at the night
And wrote her dream across the sky
All the power of heaven
No moon on nights like this
Two hands reach up...
Fire from heaven (x2)
Strangest things drove her mad
Someone she knew but never had
So don't call her anything
She sang this chain of lies
All the power of heaven
No moon on nights like this
Two hands reach up...
Nothing...nothing...nothing but the fireEmbed
