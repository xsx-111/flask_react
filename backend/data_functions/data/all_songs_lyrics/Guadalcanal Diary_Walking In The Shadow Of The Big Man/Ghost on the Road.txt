Ghost on the Road LyricsPhantom headlights, broken white line
Bloodstains on the highway, glowing power lines
Signal thirty whispers softly through the pine
He said that no one could take her away
None that could tear them apart
The song she was singing made a mans blood run cold
Like a moth in flames, torn from his heart
Ghost on the road, ah (x4)
Flashing road signs misty red eyes
Lost on the highway, not a soul in sight
Endless black ribbon racing through the night
She said that nothing in the world would survive
Lonely spirit float on the wind
No candles burned to light his way in this life
No one saw the veil of sorrow closing to an end
Ghost on the road, ah (x4)
Four barrells roll, down a country road
Driver never sleeps, engine never slows
They say he'll stop one day and look back to see
A girl who waits by the bend
Her silvery laugh will remind him of one past
By his side until the night must call her home again
Ghost on the road, ahEmbed
