Fuck You Lyrics
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her too"
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox, and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Oh, shit, she's a gold digger
(Well) Just thought you should know, nigga
Ooh, I've got some news for you
Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend

I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her too"
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Now I know that I had to borrow, hah
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin' to keep ya, tryin' to please ya
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap, nah

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Oh, shit, she's a gold digger
(Well) Just thought you should know, nigga
Ooh, I've got some news for you
Ooh, I really hate yo ass right now

I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her too"
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Now, baby, baby, baby, why do you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad? (So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my momma, but she told me, "This is one for your dad" (Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did, and I'm like
Uh, why? Uh, why?
Uh, why, lady?
Oh, I love you
Oh, I still love you, oh
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
Uh, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Fuck you and fuck her too"
Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest, I still wish you the best
With a "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)32Embed
