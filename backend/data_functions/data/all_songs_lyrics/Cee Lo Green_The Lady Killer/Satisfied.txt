Satisfied Lyrics
Baby - where's the road taking us?
And baby - that's why they call it making love
Darling I will do my best
I'm fallin at the feet of your highness
No need to ask; the answer is always yes

The least I can do is try
I, want, you, to, be, a, satisfied
Oh let me satisfy you

Baby (baby) baby just ah wait and see
And maybe (maybe) it just takes a little faith in me
Friend of mine, follow my lead
I want to make sure that I succeed
A little encouragement is all I'll need


Oooooh, I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
I want to satisfy youuuu, youuuu, youuuu
Oooooooooooooooh
 - 2X

I've got to satisfy you!
I want to satisfy you baby
Ooooh girl
Please, please, let em satisfy you maEmbed
