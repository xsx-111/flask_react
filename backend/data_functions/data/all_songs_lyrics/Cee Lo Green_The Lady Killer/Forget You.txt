Forget You Lyrics
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shh, she's a gold digger)
Well.. (Just thought you should know)
(Ooh) I've got some news for you
("...Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend")

I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)
Now I know, that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
'Cause being in love with your... ain't cheap, nah

I pity the fool, that falls in love with you
(Oh shh, she's a gold digger)
Well... (Just thought you should know)
(Ooh) I've got some news for you
("...Ooh, I really hate yo'... right now")

I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my momma, but she told me:
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did, and I'm like
Uh! Why? Uh! Why? Uh! Why lady?!
Oh, I love you
Oh, I still love you, ooh
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
"Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "forget you," and forget her, too
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (oh, ooh, oooh)14Embed
