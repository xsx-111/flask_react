Cry Baby Lyrics
Yeah, let me hold you
Don't cry baby

If this makes you cry
Girl I didn't mean it
Next time I should lie
The truth is inconvenient
I bet if you try
You could live without me
I really don't know why
You bother to cry about me

Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby, oh

I hate to see you cry
Sad to say I've seen it
We should say goodbye
And this time really mean it
When some time goes by
I'm sure that you'll feel better
But if she needs to cry
Then maybe I should let her
Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby, oh

Now, help me find a way, yeah
What more, can I say, to you

Cry, cry baby
I guess that I'm the bad guy now
Cry, cry baby
And just like all the other ones
Cry, cry baby
Build a wall around your heart
Cry, cry baby
Baby

Ohhh, ohhh, OHHHHHH (just like all the other ones)
Oh-ohh, ohh, OHHHHHH (just like all the other ones)
Cry baby, cry baby
Whenever she cry baby, cry baby
Ah-ohhhh!
Don't cry baby1Embed
