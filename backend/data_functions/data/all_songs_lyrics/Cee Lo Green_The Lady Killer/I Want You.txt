I Want You Lyrics
Hey, I love the night life yes I do it's so much fun
And before you know it ah, here comes the sun
Sweetheart it's been real but, the thrill is gone
Mmm-hmm, and inside us
Is like a spirit, that picked my house to haunt
But I know it's there so I am nonchalant
Now the question is, just what do I want?
Well, I want you
To run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done, just won't do
I want you
Would a trip to a remoted island ease your mind?
Oh, you look like a solitaire in the sunshine
I like her 'cause she's fun
She's fearless, she's a friend of mine
Oh, and I'm not trying to say you need any help
You can have anything you want wit'cho bad self
I like her 'cause she's smart, but she's still sexy
She is something else, ooh
And that's why I want you
To run away with me and experience something new
Anything you've already done, just won't do
I want you
And I want you
To tenderly and sincerely want me too
You can believe in me baby, don't be cruel
I want you
Oh, one rarely finds a lady
That happens to be three times a lady
God is good, but he took his time when he designed you, baby
That's why I want you, and
Oh, I'll even quit my job
Loving you I'll make it my job
Thank you Lord, thank you Lord, this is it, my God
Thank you Lord, this is it, my God
And that's why I want you
And I want you
Sail away and experience something new
Anything you've already done, just won't do
I want you
And I want you
To genuinely and sincerely want me too
You can believe in me baby, don't be cruel
(I want you)Embed
