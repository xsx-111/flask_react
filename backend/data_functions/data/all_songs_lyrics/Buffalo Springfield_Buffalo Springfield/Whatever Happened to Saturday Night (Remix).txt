Whatever Happened to Saturday Night (Remix) Lyrics
How can I tell her that I love her
When windy week-end warnings
Tell me summer teases?
When I first saw her with another
My world fell
And I stumbled for a while
I stumbled for a while

Whatever happened to Saturday night?

Don't know what I'm going through
Look everything is new
Each time I turn around
Feels like I'm falling down



Back home, look around
Leaves falling on the ground
Changes since I've been gone
Don't know if I belong
Spoke to her yesterday
Couldn't think of much to say
She said that by the winter
She'd be goneEmbed
