Words I Must Say (Demo) LyricsDon't you ever think about me, little girl?
Can't you tell I'm awful lonely, little girl?
I'll smile at you, but I just
Can't seem to find the nerve to say
The words that trip my mind, then
Keep holding me from day to day:
Words I must say
You got a thing or two about you, little girl
That comes on like magic when I'm near you, little girl
You've cast your spell and I'm caught!
I guess by now it really shows
That I need love from you, girl
I need you now, you just can't go
I love you soEmbed
