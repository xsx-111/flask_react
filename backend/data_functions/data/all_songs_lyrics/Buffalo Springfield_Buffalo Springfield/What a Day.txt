What a Day LyricsIt's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine
Hey, it's such a lovely day
Smile, a frown would be passe
I want to play
Oh, what a day
I've got to dream
I can't find a reason to care
And it seems
I hung all my thoughts in mid-air
Look over there
Oh, stop and stare
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine
What did you say?
It's a wonderful day
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine
Hey, it's such a lovely day
Oh, smile, a frown would just be passe
I want to play
Oh, what a day
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine (It's a good mornin')
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine (It's a good mornin')
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fine (It's a good mornin')
It's a good mornin' and I'm feelin' fineEmbed
