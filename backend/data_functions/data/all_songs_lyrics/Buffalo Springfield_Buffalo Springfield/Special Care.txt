Special Care LyricsYou there, in the window
Looking at me, do you think I'm
Blowing my cool, playing the fool?
You there, on the corner
Staring at me, do you think I'm
Trouble? Would you like to shoot me down?
No
What for?
Keep on tellin' that all special care has been taken
To make you aware of the forsaken
If you don't care they will come and
Burn your house down, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Yeah
Let us all hear that sometime they're talkin' loose
About how all men are created equal
Only some, they're more equal than othersEmbed
