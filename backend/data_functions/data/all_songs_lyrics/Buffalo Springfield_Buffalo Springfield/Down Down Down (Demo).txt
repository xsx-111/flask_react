Down Down Down (Demo) LyricsCome to see her in the river
She'll be there to wave to you
In the hope that you'll forgive her
She will join you there
Find out that now was the answer to answers
That you gave later
She did the things that we both did before now
But who forgave her?
Now you see how down you've fallen
Now you hear your conscience call
Thank yourself alone for stalling
I'm not there to call
Call me a fool, 'cause I need her and see her
But now you're down
Something inside you will tell you I'm wise to
What you're spreading round
If I could stand to see her cryin'
I would tell her not to care
When she hears of all your lyin'
She will join you there
Find out that now was the answer to answers
That you gave laterEmbed
