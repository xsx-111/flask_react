On the Way Home (Previously Unreleased Mix) LyricsWhen the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane
Like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now
In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now
Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you, can you feel it nowEmbed
