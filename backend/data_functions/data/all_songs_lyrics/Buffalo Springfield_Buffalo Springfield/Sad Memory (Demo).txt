Sad Memory (Demo) LyricsSoft winds blow in the summer time
Young lovers feel so free
Walking hand in hand down the shady lane
What happened to me?  What happened to me?
Did you ever love a girl
Who walked right out on you?
You should know just how I feel then
Why I'm so blue, why I'm so blue
How can I forget those nights
When she kissed me soft and true
And whispered the words only lovers know
Oh I love you, I love you
Well, I've made up my mind
I'll find a new girl who'll love me tenderly
Forget the past, I've left behind now
To sad memory, to sad memory
Soft winds blow in the summer timeEmbed
