Hung Upside Down (Demo) LyricsLook what's happening to me
I'm going blind, please help
There I sat until three
Gettin' further behind myself
By myself
And I'm hung upside down
And I'm hung upside down
Hung upside down, said I'm
Hung upside down, c'mon, c'mon
Hung upside down
Someday I will be free
And there'll be times, you just wait
I will come to you, see
What I'll bring you when I get straight
Oh it's too late
And I'm hung upside down
And I'm hung upside down
Hung upside down, said I'm
Hung upside down, c'mon, c'mon
Hung upside downEmbed
