No Sun Today LyricsHad a dream last night, you came walking through my life
The sun was shinin', and there were teardrops all around...
Chorus:
There'll be no sun, there'll be no sun today
There'll be no sun
Since you came my way, I have seen nothing but grey
And the raindrops keep on fallin' without a sound
(Chorus)
The way you look is so darn cruel
And with any other guy around, you're made for killin'*
It's plain to see, it won't be me
'Cause I can sure tell when you're not ______*
Summer lovely's go*, all the reasons that you know
And quit turnin' my head round and round...
(Chorus) x2Embed
