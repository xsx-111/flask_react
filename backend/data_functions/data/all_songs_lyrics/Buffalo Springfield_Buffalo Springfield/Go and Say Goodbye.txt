Go and Say Goodbye Lyrics
You ask me to read this letter
That you wrote the night before
And you really should know better
'Cause she's worth a whole lot more

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries? Is that why
You won't go and say goodbye?

Then you said the fault was yours
And you really were to blame
'Twas as if to close the doors
And to hide away in shame

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries? Is that why
You won't go and say goodbye?

Yes, and why, tell me why
Can't you see that it's not right?
It's a lie, it's a lie
Don't hide your sorrow in the night
Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries? Is that why
You won't go and say goodbye?


And you know the pain is double
But for her it's even worse
You must face her with the trouble
Though it's hurting like a curse

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries? Is that why
You won't go and say goodbye?

Brother, you know you can't run away and hide
Is it you don't want to see her cries? Is that why
You won't go and say, gonna go and say, gonna go and say goodbye?Embed
