Pretty Girl Why (Previously Unreleased Mix) LyricsLike the ghost of someone dear
She comes to haunt me in my sleep
Still unable to sincerely
Give her heart away for keeps
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why not love me?
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why?
There she leaves me twice as lonely
As I was but yesterday
Keeping such a hold upon my thoughts
So near yet far away
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why not love me?
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why?
The minstrel boy has gone to war
Now burdened with his father's sword
Still she doesn't see how she can give him
Peace amidst the horror
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why not love me?
Pretty girl why?
Pretty girl why?Embed
