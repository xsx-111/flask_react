My Kind of Love LyricsThere you go again and again, babe
Fightin' a plague that just won't end, babe
Don't know why we can't along
When we first started out nothing ever went wrong
I love to hear your voice
Once your choice of words explodes my mind!
And I'm not fooling, 'cause I don't believe in
What you see anymore in me, and all your screamin'...
You said you want my love and you're willing to return it
But what you're doing now ain't about to word it
You're driving me mad with your nagging ways
And in my kind of love, that ain't what pays
I love to hear your voice
Once your choice of words explodes my mind!
And I'm not fooling, 'cause I don't believe in
What you see anymore in me, and all your screamin'...
 both night and day
You better disregard what I have to say
'Cause I know our love means much too good
To be broke up by something misunderstood
I love to hear your voice
Once your choice of words explodes my mind!
And I'm not fooling, 'cause I don't believe in
What you see anymore in me, and all your screamin'...Embed
