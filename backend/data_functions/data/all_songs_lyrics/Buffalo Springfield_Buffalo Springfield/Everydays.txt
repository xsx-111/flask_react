Everydays Lyrics
Look at the sad goodbyes
Every day's a killing time
Sun coming up outside
No men are born this time
Saturday's child stays home
Nothing to say, so wrong

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Grocery store, ten bucks
Just making change for plastic cherries
Up in a tree, a jay bird
Yelling at me, no words
Everyone looks, can't see
Can't be ignored easily

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day
Soft within the wayward things
Of ecstasy, the sound of trees
Most any breeze, what a baby sees

Beautiful face, alright
Many a place uptight
Old woman there with red shoes
A million balloons, all hues
Drive in the hills, forget your fear
Getting it out of second gear

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Soft within the wayward things
Of ecstasy, the sound of trees
Most any breeze, what a baby seesEmbed
