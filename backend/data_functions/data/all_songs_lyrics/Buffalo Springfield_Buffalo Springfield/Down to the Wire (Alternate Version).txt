Down to the Wire (Alternate Version) LyricsEvery time you touch her sets your hands on fire
And everything you've got is all that she requires
And you hang on, hang on, hang on to the words of a liar
Can feel it’s getting down to the wire?
All the hurt you thought was gone has now returned
And everything she's laughing at is all you learned
And you let go, let go, let go, you know you're getting tired
Can you feel it’s getting down to the wire?
Take the time to close your eyes and look around
'Cause anyone who helped you out can let you down
And look out, look out, look out, the voice is now the choir
Can you feel it getting down to the wire?Embed
