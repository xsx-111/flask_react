Sit Down I Think I Love You Lyrics
Sit down I think I love you
Anyway I'd like to try
I can't stop thinking of you
If you go I'll know I cry

Can't you see that I'm a desperate man
I get high just being around
You oughta know what they say about the bird in the hand
And that's why I ain't leaving without you

So if you want someone to love you
Pretty baby I'm your guy
It's not much I'm asking of you
Just to please give me a try


Can't you see that I'm a desperate man
I get high just being around
You know what they say about the bird in my hand
And that's why I ain't leaving without you
So if you want someone to love you
Pretty baby I'm your guy
It's not much I'm asking of you
Just to please give me a try

Sit down I think I love you
Sit down I think I love you
Sit down I think I love you
Sit down I think I love1Embed
