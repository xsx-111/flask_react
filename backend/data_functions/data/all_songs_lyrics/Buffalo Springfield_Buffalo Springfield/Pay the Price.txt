Pay the Price Lyrics
Well I've heard this story once before
And I know what the tears are for
That's a line that I just can't buy
You can't fool me so don't try

And I see another man in your eyes
Yes, and you're old enough to know you can't live lies
Yes, and so I'm telling you just exactly what to do
'Cause you can't have two tastes of advice
Pay the price

And if on another time or place
Another day, another face
I'm telling you, babe, it's all you know
That one of us is gonna have to go

And I see another man in your eyes
Yes, and you're old enough to know you can't live lies
Yes, and so I'm telling you just exactly what to do
'Cause you can't have two tastes of advice
Pay the price

Yes, and I know you hate to see me cry
But I have to go and I tell you why
Without your love I just can't go on
It's easy and itâ€™s wrong

And I see another man in your eyes
Yes, and you're old enough to know you can't live lies
Yes, and so I'm telling you just exactly what to do
'Cause you can't have two tastes of advice
Pay the priceEmbed
