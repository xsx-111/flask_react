Leave Lyrics
Nobody knows, nobody sees
That what you can do we know is please
But in most of the time
Not me
Yeah hear my plea, leave

Go away, to stay
Get out of my life, you've been my wife
I've gonna choose
To be
Yeah hear, my plea, leave

You will be sorry
When you wake up tomorrow
And you leave a lover
Won't leave a love
You won't accept the fact
That I'm not ready for the death above
Forever love

By the look, on your face
Is that you'll make it to another place
I'll see you around
My sweet
Won't you please hear my plea, leave
Alright

You will be sorry
When you wake up tomorrow
And you leave a lover
Won't speak for love
You won't accept the fact
That I'm not ready for the death above
Forever love

By the look on your face
Is that you'll make it to another place
I'll see you around
My sweet
Won't you please hear my plea, leave

Ah, nobody knows, nobody sees
That what you can do we know is please
But in most of the time
Not me
Won't you please hear, my plea
With what you're doin' to me
Won't you please hear my plea, leaveEmbed
