Come On (Demo) LyricsCome on, lover
Can't you see that the time is late
Let's run for cover
I want you and I just can't wait
Please decide, don't try to hide
Love me, you can make the time
Don't pretend everybody's your friend
Just pick one and explore them eyes
And don't try to figure out why
It's just the night and some chemistry
And quit stalling 'cause I think I'm falling in love with you
Like it's supposed to be
Come on, lover
Can't you see that the time is late
Let's run for cover
I want you and I just can't waitEmbed
