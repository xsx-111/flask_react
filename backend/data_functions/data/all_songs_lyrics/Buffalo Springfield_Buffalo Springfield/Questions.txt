Questions Lyrics
Where are we going, love?
What are you feelin'?
Now that I've caught my love
My head is reelin'

With the questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Come on lover, talk to me

When I was on my own
Chasin' you down
What was it made you run
Tryin' to get around

The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Come on lover, talk to me


Now that we've found each other
Where do we go now?
I'd like to know what you're thinkin'
Answer me slowly now
The questions of a thousand dreams
What you do and what you see
Come on lover, talk to me, yeahEmbed
