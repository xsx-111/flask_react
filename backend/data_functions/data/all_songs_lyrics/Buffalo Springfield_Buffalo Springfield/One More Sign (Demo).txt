One More Sign (Demo) LyricsNo i'm not gonna to hide my feelings
Couldn't if i tried
No i'm not holding them inside
Holding back is so close to stealing
Though we both have tried
We could lose it all if we lied
Someday it's later than
The feelings we have now
It's of the ground
I've always played around
But now i don't know how
Listen easy because i'm saying
What i mean this time
Sharing words i always said were mine
I was breezy now i'm swaying
Like the tree we climbed
Asking you to give me one more signEmbed
