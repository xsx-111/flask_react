There Goes My Babe (Demo) Lyrics
The end has come
The sky has lost its sun
The harm is done
He was the only one

There goes my babe
There goes what might have been
There goes my babe in the cool morning rain
And now my heart lies empty and still again

If he were here
I'd long to hold him near
But now it's clear
The price of love is dear

There goes my babe
There goes what might have been
There goes my babe in the cool morning rain
And now my heart lies empty and still againEmbed
