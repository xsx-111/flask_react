My Angel (Demo) LyricsMy angel, there she goes
Where she comes from, nobody knows
She come walkin' softly with a good word
And a smile that just glows
The kind that comes before you know
It said "love me easy, I have suffered."
It was me, somehow I knew
Suddenly not quite so blue
She caught me in the midst of a fall
And she leaned me against the wall
My angel, will she go?
Perhaps she will, I don't know
If she does, I'll be sorry, but I did know
My angel
It was me, somehow I knew
Suddenly not quite so blue
She caught me in the midst of a fall
And she leaned me against the wall
My angel, will she go?
Perhaps she will, I don't know
If she does, I'll be sorry, but I did know
