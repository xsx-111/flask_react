Round and Round and Round (Demo) LyricsRound and round and round we spin
To weave a wall to hem us in
It won't be long
It won't be long
How slow and slow and slow it goes
To mend the tear that always shows
It won't be long
It won't be long
It's hard enough losin'
The paper illusion
You've hidden inside
Without the confusion
Of findin' you're usin'
The crutch of a lie
To shelter your eye when you cry
Round and round and round we spin
To weave a wall to hem you in
It won't be long
It won't be long
How slow and slow and slow it goes
To mend the tear that always shows
It won't be long
It won't be long
Now you're movin' too slow
And wherever you go
There's another beside
It's so hard to say no
To yourself and it shows
That you're losing inside
When you step on your pride and you cry
Round and round and round we spin
To weave a wall to hem us in
It won't be long
It won't be long
How slow and slow and slow it goes
To mend the tear that always shows
It won't be long
It won't be long
How the hours will bend
Through the time that you spend
Till you turn to your eyes
And you see your best friend
Looking over the end
And you turn to see why
And he looks in your eyes and he cries
Round and round and round we spin
To weave a wall to hem us in
It won't be long
It won't be longEmbed
