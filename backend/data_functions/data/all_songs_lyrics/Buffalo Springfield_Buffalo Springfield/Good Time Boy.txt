Good Time Boy Lyrics
Now look what I've done, it seems that I own some
As all it turn back now to see that
Bein' all of the good times and all of my fat lines
Upstaging a climaxing dream, yeah

'Cause if it's all right to be your good time boy
If it's all right, be your good boy
If it's all right to be your good time boy
If it's all right, it's all right, yeah
Sock it to me, now now now

Why should I mind if I step right out of line
And I get caught by her, get caught by her, lucky me, yeah?
'Cause now I've loved a few, that's why they call me, call me "good old dude"
And I can't, I can't change right now it seems, yeah

If it's all right to be your good time boy
If it's all right, be your good boy
If it's all right to be your good time boy
If it's all right, it's all right, yeah
Sock it to me now
Groove it on me now
You lay it on me now, ooh

Sock it to me, baby
If it's all right, be your boy, be your boy
And it's all right, be your boyEmbed
