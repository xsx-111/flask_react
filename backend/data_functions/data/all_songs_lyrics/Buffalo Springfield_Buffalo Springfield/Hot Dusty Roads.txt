Hot Dusty Roads Lyrics
I don't tell no tales about no hot dusty roads
I'm a city boy and I stay at home
I make no excuses I just don't want to roam
And I don't like being alone

I give you loving and a place to take off your shoes
It does surprising things for a case of the blues
It ain’t no club, you don’t have to pay no dues
You just love me and I love you

And if you take some pride in being alive
If you're interested in looking inside of yourself
Just drop on by, baby ask me why
At least you don't have to be by yourself

Just come knock, most likely I'll be there
Then you look around, find a comfortable chair
And then you sit, and you might think about why he's there
I can't tell you why, only where

And if you take some pride in being alive
If you're interested in looking inside of yourself
Just drop on by, baby ask me why
At least you don't have to be by yourself
Just come knock, most likely I'll be there
Then you look around, find a comfortable chair
And then you sit, and you might think about why he's there
I can't tell you why, only where

I don't tell no tales about no hot dusty roads
I'm a city boy and I stay at home
I make no excuses I just don't want to roam
And I don't like being alone

Alright, and I don't like being alone
One more time
And I don't like being aloneEmbed
