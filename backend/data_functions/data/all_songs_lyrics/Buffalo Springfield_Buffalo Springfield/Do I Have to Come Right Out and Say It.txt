Do I Have to Come Right Out and Say It Lyrics
Do I have to come right out and say it?
Tell you that you look so fine
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?

If it was a game I could play it
Tryin' to make it but I'm losin' time
I got to bring you in, you're overworkin' my mind

Indecision is crowding me
I have no room to spare
And I can't believe she'd care
Like a dream she has taken me
And now I don't know where
And a part of me is scared
The part of me I shared
Once before

Do I have to come right out and say it?
Tell you that you look so fine (Look so fine)
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?

Indecision is crowding me
I have no room to spare
And I can't believe she'd care
Like a dream she has taken me
And now I don't know where
And a part of me is scared
The part of me I shared
Once before

Do I have to come right out and say it, girl?
Tell you that you look so fine (Look so fine)
Do I have to come right out and ask you to be mine?

If it was a game I could play it
Tryin' to make it but I'm losin' time (Losin' time)
I got to bring you in, you're overworkin' my mind

Do I have to come right out and say it, girl?
Tell you that you look so fine (Look so fine)1Embed
