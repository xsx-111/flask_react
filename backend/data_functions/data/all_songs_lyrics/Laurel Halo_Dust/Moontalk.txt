Moontalk Lyrics
Oh my gosh

Anata no hajime, omedetou
Otsukaresana, omedetou
Yokude kimashita, omedetou
Yokuya attane, omedetou

What if you slept?
And what if in your sleep, you dreamed?
And what if in your dream
You went to heaven?
And there thumbed the glasslit flower
And the sheets were stained too

Anata no hajime, omedetou
Mono no aware, omedetou
Ii tenke desu ne, omedetou
Baka ja naido, omedetou

What if you walked?
And what if on your walk, you breathed?
And what if on your breath
You heard the moon talk?
Murdering like a stranded fish
Dying to be wet
There's no beauty in that glass
Only sand and fire
Anata no hajime, omedetou
Ii tenke desu ne, omedetou
Nibecha dame da, omedetou
Yokude kimashita, omedetou

What if you stood?
And what if on your stand, you saw?
And what if in your sight
You ate a charging tank
The shells had no aftertaste
And the soldiers went down fine
But then the sky turned deadly and blue

Anata no hajime, omedetou
Otsukaresana, omedetou
Yokude kimashita, omedetou
Yokuya attane, omedetouEmbed
