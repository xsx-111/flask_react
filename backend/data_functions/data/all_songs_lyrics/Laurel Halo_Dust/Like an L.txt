Like an L Lyrics
A body shaped like an L
Of crossed papers or like
The halfway point
Between sleeping or standing

Watching still berries
On even stiller branches
Blossoms that stay in your eyes
After you look away

Pacific Street of Sunset Building
Their thirst was once a mellow fantasma

I bet you were wondering
Lucky girls like scanned letters of sound
Cancerous secrets like trails from Panama
Their thirst was once a mellow fantasma

Watching still berries
On even stiller branches
Blossoms that stay in your eyes
After you look awayEmbed
