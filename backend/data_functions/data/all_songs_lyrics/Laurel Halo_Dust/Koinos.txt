Koinos Lyrics
Calling blind
You're just another liar
I've been unblinded
You're just another liar

Calling blind
You're just another liar
And, and the koinos

Calling blind
You're just another liar
I am the koinos

Throws its empties out the window
Calling blind
You're just another liar

Calling blind
You're just another liar
I've been unblinded
You're just another liar
Are you hearing us?
Are you blind?
You're just another liar
I am the koinos

You're just another liar
You're just another liar

Throws its empties out the window
You're just another liar
You're just another liarEmbed
