Jelly Lyrics
And you are a thief and you drink too...

Net and favor 'til late
Good for a kill for a flavor
First love, best thought
Heartbreak is just an art

You don't meet my ideal standards for a friend
And you are a thief and you drink too much
And you fuck around too much
And you don't deserve it
And you are a hypocrite and you can't do this
Oh, I can do this

Sometimes I know not to drink too much
Again, the sun's out today
Where is the shade?
They've gone away

My eyes
Back there in the mirror
Where I left them
My eyes
Back there in the mirror
Where I left them
Fat thick rain, tell me one thing
(My eyes back there in the mirror
Where I left them)
Did you mean to make it fall?
(My eyes back there in the mirror
Where I left them)
Rivulets down his face
(My eyes back there in the mirror
Where I left them)
Taking names when we're asleep

Taking names, taking names
My eyes are back there in the mirror where I left them
Net and favor 'til late

Sometimes I know not to drink too much
Again, the sun's out today
Where is the shade?
They've all gone, they've all gone away

Taking names on a golden surface
Taking names on a golden surface
(My eyes back there)
Taking names on a golden surface
Taking names on a surface
You can't do
You can't do this
I can do this
I can't let it fall forever
I can do this
You don't deserve
You don't deserve
You don't deserve this
You can't do this
You can't do
You can't do this
I can do thisEmbed
