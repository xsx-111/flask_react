Syzygy Lyrics
I was in a daredevil's car
She said, "Get ready"
I turned my eyes away
As she released an evil laugh

Until the effortless landing
On the other side
Just a layer of fuel
Plastic playset, action figure

I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"

Ramping the speed, we shot down the hill
No ground beneath
Weightlessness as in togetherness
Across your lies
As I walked past, she looked at me
Like two silver bullets
Then she licked my leg
And give me some sisterly advice

I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"

My eyes closed the whole time in fear
Until I saw distance
It was red and pleasantly hot
Vistas of sand and trees

I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
At the terminus
The queen was sitting on her throne
I was as quiet as possible
Not looking at her

At the end, it started to descend
And by then
I was walking in water
Up to my thighs

I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
I said, "Get up"
I said, "Time for love"
Beyond the trees at the beach
There were two walking paths of sand
One that went right along the coast
The other that went up around a bend
Like a highway onramp
I took the second
It had a view as it went up
Higher than the coastal path
Before the end it started to descend
And by then, I was walking in water
Up to my thighs
There, at the terminus
A queen was sitting on her throne
I tried to be as as quiet as possible
Not looking at her, not speaking to her
As I walk past, she licks my leg
And stares up at me like two bullets
And then proceeds to give me sisterly advice
That I can't remember now
At the end, it started to descend
And by then
I was walking in water
Up to my thighsEmbed
