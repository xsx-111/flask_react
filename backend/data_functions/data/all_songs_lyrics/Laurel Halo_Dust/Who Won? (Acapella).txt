Who Won? (Acapella) LyricsI am waiting for you
In thirteen minutes
Please, fill out this form
He never gives me anything
Here it is
Who would you like to speak to?
They arrived yesterday
Everything is ready
What's the phone number?
What's the password?
Who won?
They're waiting for us
The house is very big
I only have five dollars
Do you have a problem?
I think so
Do you think it's possible?
I'll call back later
I don't know
A single?
No, this is the fifth time
What color is that car?
Stop!
It's there
I'll call you when I leave
Can I see your passport, please?
I've been here for two days
Where do you want to go?
That's not enough
It takes two hours by car
And then, hardened by the wind
A hood found in sand
She wanted to know when you're coming
Try to say it
"Thanks for your help"
Go to New York
When does he arrive?
I believe you
As soon as possible
Everything is ready
What's the phone number?
What's the password?
Who won?Embed
