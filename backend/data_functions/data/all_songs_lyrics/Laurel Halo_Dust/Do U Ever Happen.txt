Do U Ever Happen Lyrics
Four friends
A car, a field, a lake
Insects and incest

Liter lager for year
Freedom from clothing
Slime and reeds

Did this ever happen?
Do you ever happen?

Since I was a kid
I loved lighting fires
Small scraps of leaves and plastic

But what light?
What light through
Subtle moon

Meanwhile in the city
A solar leaned down to drink
It seemed to smile and follow
A silver backdrop
Can I weather your problems
Or get deep inside your dreams?

Did this ever happen?
Do you ever happen?

Did this ever happen?
Do you ever happen?

Did this ever happen?
Do you ever happen?

Did this ever happen?
Do you ever happen?

Did this ever happen?
Do you ever happen?

Did this ever happen?
Do you ever happen?
Did this ever happen?
Do you ever happen?Embed
