Orange Crush Lyrics
(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time
To serve your conscience overseas (Over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me

(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time
To serve your conscience overseas (Over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me

High on the roof
Thin the blood
Another one came on the waves tonight
Coming in, you're home
"We would circle and we'd circle and we'd circle
To stop and consider and centered on the pavement
Stacked up all the trucks jacked up and our wheels
In slush and orange crush in pocket and all
This here county, hell, any county, it's just like heaven here
And I was remembering and I was just in a different county and all
Then this whirlybird that I headed for I had my goggles pulled off;
I knew it all, I knew every back road and every truck stop"

(Follow me, don't follow me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(Collar me, don't collar me)
I've got my spine, I've got my orange crush
(We are agents of the free)
I've had my fun and now it's time
To serve your conscience overseas (Over me, not over me)
Coming in fast, over me

High on the roof
Thin the blood
Another one came on the waves tonight
Coming in, you're home
High on the roof
Thin the blood
Another one came on the waves tonight
Coming in, youâ€™re home7Embed
