You Are the Everything Lyrics
Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing
(Say, say, the light) I'm very scared for this world, I'm very scared for me
(Say, say, the light) Eviscerate your memory, here's a scene
You're in the back seat laying down
(Say, say, the light) The windows wrap around to the sound of the travel and the engine
(Say, say, the light)

All you hear is time stand still in travel
And feel such peace and absolute, the stillness still
That doesn't end but slowly drifts into sleep
The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen
And they're there for you, for you alone
You are the everything

I think about this world a lot and I cry (Say, say, the light)
And I've seen the films and the eyes
(Say, say, the light) But I'm in this kitchen, everything is beautiful
(Say, say, the light) And she is so beautiful, she is so young and old
(Say, say, the light) I look at her and I see the beauty of the light of music

The voices talking somewhere in the house, late spring
And you're drifting off to sleep with your teeth in your mouth
You are here with me, you are here with me
You have been here and you are everything
Sometimes I feel like I can't even sing
(Say, say, the light) I'm very scared for this world, I'm very scared for me
(Say, say, the light) Eviscerate your memory, here's a scene
You're in the back seat laying down
(Say, say, the light) The windows wrap around to sound of the travel and the engine
(Say, say, the light)

All you hear is time stand still in travel
And feel such peace and absolute, the stillness still
That doesn't end but slowly drifts into sleep
The stars are the greatest thing you've ever seen
And they're there for you, for you alone
You are the everything

For you alone you are the everything4Embed
