Turn You Inside-Out Lyrics
Yeah
Divide your cultured pearls in haste
I'm looking for to lay to waste
Of all the things I cannot taste
And this not the recent race

They spoke loud
"I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you"
It's what you do
"I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you"

I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do

Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheers
They spoke loud
"I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you"
It's what you do
"I believe in what you do
I believe in watching you"

I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do
I could turn you inside-out
What I choose not to do

Given the choice
Given the heart
Given the tool
Given the word
Given the cheer1Embed
