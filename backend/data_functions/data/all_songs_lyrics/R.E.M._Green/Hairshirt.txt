Hairshirt LyricsI am not the type of dog that could keep you waiting
For no good reason
Run a carbon-black test on my jaw
And you will find it's all been said before
I can swing my megaphone
And long arm the rest
It's easier and better to just beat it from the chest
Of desire
I could walk into this room
And the waves of conversation are enough
To knock you down in the undertow
So alone, so alone in my life
Feed me banks of light and hang your hairshirt
On the lowest rung, it's a beautiful life
And I can hang my hairshirt away up high in the attic
Of the wrong dog's life chest
Or bury it at sea
All my life I've searched for this
Here I am, here I am
In your life
It's a beautiful life, my life
It's a beautiful life, your lifeEmbed
