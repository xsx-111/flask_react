A Light in the Black Lyrics
Can't forget his face
What a lonely place
Has he really let us go?
All the time that's lost
What's the final cost
Will I really get away?
All my life it seems
Just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star

Can't believe it all
Did he really fall
What to do now I don't know
Something's called me back
There's a light in the black
Am I ready to go?
I'm coming home

Breathed the air before
Heard the thunder roar
Never knew it was for me
Always looking down
Lost and never found
Eyes that look but not to see
All my life it seems
Just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star
Like an open door
That you've passed before
But you've never had the key
Something's calling me back
There's a light in the black
Am I ready to go?
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, yeah
I'm going back to my home



I'm going home, home, home
Going home, home, home
I'm coming back

Don't forget his face
What a lonely place
Did he really let us go
All the time that's lost
What's the final cost
Will I really get away?
All my life it seems
Just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star
Can't believe it all
Did he really fall
What to do now, well I don't know
Something's calling me back
Like a light in the black
Yes, I'm ready to go
I'm coming home, home, yeah

I've got my way back home
To the sky
There in the sky
I see your star1Embed
