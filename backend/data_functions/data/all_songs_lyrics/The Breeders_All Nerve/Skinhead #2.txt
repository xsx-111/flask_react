Skinhead #2 LyricsI need spit
To crush these beetles on my lips
They run
Down the phonics from my hand to the tick-tick
If I find
One good mallet in my sigh
It won't last long
Tough kids love sad songs
They sing along
Sing for me
We clear the pine
And saved it for the biggest shrine
Made for paler men
For them to sink in
To take the night
We dosed the pharaohs
Pulled the heist
Filled our lungs
And blow out
The sun
And sing sad songs
Sing for me
Sad songs
Tough kids love to sing along
They are free
They are freeEmbed
