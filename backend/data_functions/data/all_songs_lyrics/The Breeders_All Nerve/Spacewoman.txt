Spacewoman LyricsSpacewoman, spacewoman
How lonely does it feel?
You're spinning round and round
I look up
I'm down here, rolling around too
I look up
Look up
Look up
There's a beachball in the stadium
Playing baseball out there, havin' fun
Hitting home runs and line drives
With the sun in their eyes
I look up
Look up
I'm lonely too
I watch you disappear
You have no gravity
How long?
When you look out at your big light show
Do you ever wanna turn around and go?
Hitting every green light on the long way home
We got a beachball in the stadium
Everybody's havin' fun
When you close your eyes
You spin in peace
Spacewoman, spacewoman
How lonely does it feel?
I look up
Look up
Look up
There's a beachball in the stadium
Playing baseball out there, havin' fun
Hitting home runs and line drives
With the sun in your eyes
See all the oceans
Hear us on the radio
Do you ever wanna turn around and go
You're hitting every green light on the long way homeEmbed
