Dawn: Making an Effort LyricsSmiling skulls tonguing the burn
Our haunted throats rally
Rally
Smiling skulls running us down
Get it together
Rally
Rally
Raptured flowers
One wild sprawl
Untethered
Making an effort
Making an effort
Captured throats
Dawn running us down
Running us down
Dawn running us down
Running us down
Dawn running us down
Running us downEmbed
