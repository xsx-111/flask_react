Blues at the Acropolis LyricsI'll mourn over the marble steps
Junkies of the world lay across the monuments
I climb and blister on the mount
Drunks take a piss where heroes once bled out
Capital sister, I cry and I blister on the mount
Gods offer beer and hope where heroes once bled out
I got the blues at the Acropolis
I kick up dirt
The men stop and hiss
I groan up and down the steps
Junkies of the world draped across the monuments
Capital sister, I cry and then I blister on the mount
I got the blues at the Acropolis
I've got the blues at the AcropolisEmbed
