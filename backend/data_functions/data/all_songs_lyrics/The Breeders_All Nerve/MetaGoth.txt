MetaGoth LyricsCan't come closer
Might fall and drown
Can't come closer
Might fall ninety-million miles
No one's here, no one's here to stay
No one's here, no one's here to stay
No one
No one's here, no one's here to stay
No one, no one, no one
Ninety-million miles away
I am the silence
I am the sound
I am the silver
Oh silver leaves
I am a shadow, a shadow
Ninety-million milesEmbed
