Wait in the Car Lyrics
Good morning!
Consider I
Always struggle with the right word
Meow meow meow meow meow
As a sinner I unlock
Nothing but need

Sinner I
Sinner I
Sinner I
Oh, oh
Mother wants to hold me down
Oh, oh
Wait in the car!
I got business!

Forget the sun tried to get off
Takin' a nap cause strategy's for punks
Mother wants to hold me down
Mother wants to hold me down
Gonna trace the stars
Makin' a map
Scrapin' at the sky
Just to fall back
Sinner I
Sinner I
Sinner I
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, ohEmbed
