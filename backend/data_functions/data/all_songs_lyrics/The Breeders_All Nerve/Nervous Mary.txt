Nervous Mary LyricsMadrid in my nose
Black lung in my hand
West.  by God.  Virginia in my head
Heartbeat
Hustle and pound
She's running down the wrong street
Wrong beat
Faster boy
Nervous Mary had a nervous day
Ox blow
Strange glow
She runs for the exit but she never got away
Road goat
Run but she never got away
Hot road
(Run for it)
Nervous Mary had a nervous day
Boss
Better than stolen
I'll scream in the meadow 'til you're bold then
Aheeyah
Aheeyah
Run for your life they're coming upon us
Ox blow
Strange glow
She runs for the exit but she never got away
Road goat
Run but she's never far away
Hot road
(Run for it)
Nervous Mary had a nervous dayEmbed
