Walking with a Killer LyricsI'm walking with a killer and I'm gonna need that ride
We rolled through the night
Through the cornfields of East 35
I didn't know I should hide
I didn't know it was my night to die
But it really was
I had no desire for hopes or holidays
Yet our eyes meet
I slide to him, my thigh sticking on the seat
I'm a dark star
Done
I glow in the headlights as they hit the street
I am blinding
I'm walking with a killer and I'm gonna need that ride
We rolled through the night
Through the cornfields of East 35
I would not survive
I didn't know it was my time to die
I'm going out
I'm a dark star
Done
I glow in the headlights as I hit the street
All the way home he kissed me2Embed
