Howl at the Summit LyricsWasting with leisure and stale as a corpse
I crash through the port
You may have spirit but I'll never hear it
I polish my scales and get nearer and nearer
All through the country
(Light it up)
All of it falling
All through the country
(Light it up)
All of it falling
Howl at the summit to just keep 'em coming
You may have spirit but I'll never hear it
You jump off but can you clear it
All through the country
(Light it up)
All of it falling
All through the country
(Light it up)
All of it falling
All through the country
(Light it up)
All of it falling
All through the country
(Light it up)
All of it fallingEmbed
