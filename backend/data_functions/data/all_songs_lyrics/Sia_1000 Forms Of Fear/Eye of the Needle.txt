Eye of the Needle Lyrics
Take me down
I'm feeling now
And if I move on
I admit you're gone

And I ain't ready but I'll hold steady
I'll hold you in my arms, in my arms, in my arms

You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle

Step and repeat
Tears fall to the beat
Smile through the pain
Feel the acid rain

And I ain't ready but I'll hold steady
I'll hold you in my arms, in my arms, in my arms
And you're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle

My bags' heavy, been filled by me
They weigh me down, carry them 'round
It's all mine, all mine
I am blinded by the eye of the needle

You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle, eye of the needle
You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle35Embed
