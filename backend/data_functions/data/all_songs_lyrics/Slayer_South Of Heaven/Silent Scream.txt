Silent Scream Lyrics
Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death
Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest
Guidance, it means nothing
In a world of brutal time
Electric, circus, wild
Deep in the infants mind

Silent scream
Bury the unwanted child
Beaten and torn
Sacrifice the unborn

Shattered, another child
Bearer of no name
Restrained, insane games
Suffer, the children condemned
Scattered, remnants of life
Murder, a time to die
Pain, sufferaged, toyed
Life's little fragments destroyed
Silent scream
Crucify the bastard sons
Beaten and torn
Sanctify lives of scorn


Life preordained
Humanity maintained
Extraction, termination
Pain's agonizing stain
Embryonic death
Embedded in your brain
Suffocation, strangulation
Death is fucking you insane

Nightmare, the persecution
A child's dream of death
Torment, ill forgotten
A soul that will never rest

Innocence withdrawn in fear
Fires burning, can you hear cries in the night?2Embed
