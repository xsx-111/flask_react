South of Heaven Lyrics
An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims, no warnings, no signs
Judgement day, the second coming arrives
Before you see the light, you must die

Forgotten children conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
The never ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven


The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
The never ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
