Dissident Aggressor Lyrics
Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all

Stab, fight
The hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, fight
I know what I am, I'm Berlin

Cracked, blackened memories of unit dispersal
I face the impregnable wall

Stab, fight
The hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, fight
I know what I am, I'm Berlin


Exploding, reloading, this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath
Stab, fight
The hooks to my brain are well in
Stab, fight
I know what I am, I'm BerlinEmbed
