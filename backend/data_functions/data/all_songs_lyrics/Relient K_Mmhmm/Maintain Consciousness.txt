Maintain Consciousness Lyrics
Our concentration, it contains a deadly flaw
Our conversations change from words to "Blah, blah, blah"
We took prescription drugs, but look how much good that did
Well, I think I had a point, but I just got distracted
'Cause lately it just seems to me
Like we've got the letters A.D.D
Branded into our mentality
We simply can't focus on anything

Because it's 17, 18, 19 routine
And here at 23, it's the same old me
And the one thing in the moment that we all happen to like
Will only very temporarily, kinda break the cycle
Of the double-edged sword
Of being lazy and being bored
We just want more, and more, and more
Until it's all we can afford

To keep our eyes open for just one more day
To keep on hoping that we'll stumble on our way
To keep our minds open for just one more day
'Cause it's completely up to us
To maintain consciousness
No one can possibly listen to this
More than 4 reps is just monotonous
We're losing interest
Losing interest
Losing interest

'Cause it's 17, 18, 19 routine
And here at 23, it's the same old me
And the one thing in the moment that we all happen to like
Will only very temporarily, kinda break the cycle
Of the double-edged sword
Of being lazy and being bored
We just want more, and more, and more
Until it's all we can afford

To keep our eyes open for just one more day
To keep on hoping that we'll stumble on our way
To keep our minds open for just one more day
'Cause it's completely up to us
To maintain consciousness
Keep our eyes open for just one more day
To keep on hoping that we'll stumble on our way
To keep our minds open for just one more day
'Cause it's completely up to us
To maintain consciousnessEmbed
