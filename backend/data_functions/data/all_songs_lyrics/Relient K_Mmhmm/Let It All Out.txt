Let It All Out Lyrics
Let it all out (Get it all out)
Rip it out, remove it
Don't be alarmed when the wound begins to bleed
'Cause we're so scared to find out (What this life's all about)
So scared we're gonna lose it
Not knowing all along
That's exactly what we need

And today I will trust You with a confidence
Of a man who's never known defeat
But tomorrow, upon hearing what I did
I will stare at You in disbelief
Oh, inconsistent me
Crying out for consistency

And You said, "I know that this will hurt
But if I don't break your heart then things will just get worse
If the burden seems too much to bear
Remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there"

And I'll let it be known (At times I have shown)
Signs of all my weakness
But somewhere in me
There is strength
And You promise me (That You believe)
In time I will defeat this
'Cause somewhere in me
There is strength
And today I will trust you with the confidence
Of a man who's never known defeat
And I'll try my best to just forget
That that man isn't me

And You said, "I know that this will hurt
But if I don't break your heart then things will just get worse
If the burden seems too much to bear
Remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there"
You said, "I know that this will hurt (I know this will hurt)
But if I don't break your heart then things will just get worse
(Things will get much worse)
When the burden seems too much to bear
(Seems too much to bear)
Remember the end will justify the pain it took to get us there"

Reach out to me
Make my heart brand new
Every beat will be for You
For You
And I know You know
You touched my life
When You touched my heavy heart
And made it lightEmbed
