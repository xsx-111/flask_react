Which to Bury; Us or the Hatchet? Lyrics
I think you know what I'm getting at
I find it so upsetting that
The memories that you select
You keep the bad but the good, you just forget
And even though I'm angry, I can still say
I know my heart will break the day
When you peel out and drive away
I can't believe this happened

And all this time I never thought
That all we had would be all for naught

No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you but right now I just don't like you
No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you but right now I just don't like you
'Cause you took this too far, too far

Make your decision and don't you dare think twice
Go with your instincts along with some bad advice
This didn't turn out the way I thought it would at all
You blame me but some of this is still your fault
I tried to move you, but you just wouldn't budge
I tried to hold your hand, but you'd rather hold your grudge
I think you know what I'm getting at
You said goodbye and I just don't want you regretting that
No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you but right now I just don't like you
No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you but right now I just don't like you

And wisdom always chooses
These black eyes and these bruises
Over the heartache that they say
Never completely goes away
(I just can't believe this happened)
And wisdom always chooses (And one day we'll see this come around)
These black eyes and these bruises (And one day we'll see this come around)
Over the heartache that they say
Never completely goes away

No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you but right now I just don't like you
No, I don't hate you
Don't want to fight you
Know I'll always love you but right now I just don't like you
'Cause you took this too far
What happened to us?
I heard that it's me we should blame
What happened to us?
Why didn't you stop me from turnin' out this way?
And know that I don't hate you
And know that I don't want to fight you
And know I'll always love you
But right now I just don'tEmbed
