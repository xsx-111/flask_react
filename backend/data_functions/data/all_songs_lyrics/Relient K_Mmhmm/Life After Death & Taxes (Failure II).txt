Life After Death & Taxes (Failure II) Lyrics
Hey taxi, take me straight to the heart of it
The nucleus of politics where somebody, somebody started it
'Cause they taxed me
With a scalpel, piece by piece
They cut me deep and bled me dry
'Till there was nothing left to bleed

And this is how I choose to live
As if I'm jumping off a cliff
Knowing that You'll save me
Knowing that You'll save me
And after all the stupid things I did
There's nothing left there to forgive
Because You already forgave me
Yeah, You already forgave me

Just keep driving
Leave this defeat miles behind me
So far back I'd have to rack my mind to just remind me
I keep trying
To pick myself back up and then move on
And think about the life I'll have when this fragile one is gone
And this is how I choose to live
As if I'm jumping off a cliff
Knowing that You'll save me
Knowing that You'll save me
And after all the stupid things I did
There's nothing left there to forgive
'Cause You already forgave me
Yeah, You already forgave me

Never forget
There's life after death and taxes
And forgiveness comes
Then all of the rest is what passes away
Death and decay can't touch us now


Every breath that I inhale is followed by exhaling
Sure as the One who never fails, I know will never fail me

Just never forget
There's life after death and taxes
And forgiveness comes (Forgiveness comes)
Then all of the rest is what passes
Never forget
There's life after death and taxes
And forgiveness comes
Then all of the rest is what passes away
Death and decay can't touch us nowEmbed
