I So Hate Consequences Lyrics
And I'm good, good, good to go
And I'm good, good, good to go
I gotta get away
Get away from all of my mistakes
And I'm good, good, good to go
And I'm good, good, good to go
I gotta get away
Get away from all of my mistakes

So here I sit looking at the traffic lights
The red extinguishes the hope that the green ignites
I want to run away, I want to ditch my life
'Cause all of my mistakes keep me awake at night

And after all of my alibis desert me
I just want to get by, I don't want nothing to hurt me
I had no idea where my head was at
But if my heart says I'm sorry, can we leave it at that?
Because I just want for all of this to end

And I so hate consequences
And running from You is what is my best defense is
Whoa, consequences
God, don't make me face up to this
And I so hate consequences
And running from You is what my best defense is
'Cause I know that I let You down (I know that I let You down)
And I don't want to deal with that
And I'm good, good, good to go
And I'm good, good, good to go
I got to get away
Get away from all of my mistakes

It just now hit me this is more then just a set back
And when You spelled it out, well, I guess I didn't get that
And every trace of momentum is gone
And this isn't turning out the way I want

And after all of my alibis desert me
I just want to get by, I don't want nothing to hurt me
And I had no idea where my head was at
But if my heart says I'm sorry, can we leave it at that?
Because I just want for all of this to end

And I so hate consequences
And running from You is what is my best defense is
Whoa, consequences
God, don't make me face up to this
And I so hate consequences
And running from You is what my best defense is
'Cause I know that I let You down (I know that I let You down)
And I don't want to deal with that
And I spent all last night (Tearing down)
Every stoplight (And stop sign in this town)
Now I think there might (Be no way to stop me now)
I'll get away despite (The fact I'm so weighed down)
All of my escapes have been exhausted
I thought I had a way but then I lost it
And my resistance was once much stronger
And I know I can't go on like this much longer

When I got tired of running from You
I stopped right there to catch my breath
There Your words, they caught my ears
You said, "I miss you, son. Come home."
And my sins, they watched me leave
And in my heart I so believed
The love You felt for me was mine
The love I'd wished for all this time
And when the doors were closed
I heard no "I told you so's"
I said the words I knew You knew
"Oh God, oh God I needed You
God, all this time I needed You
I needed You"
And I so hate consequences
Running from You is what is my best defense is
I hate these consequences
'Cause I know that I let You down
And I don't want to deal with that1Embed
