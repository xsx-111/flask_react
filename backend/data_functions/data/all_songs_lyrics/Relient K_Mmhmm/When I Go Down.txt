When I Go Down Lyrics
I'll tell you flat out
It hurts so much to think of this
So from my thoughts I will exclude
The very thing that
I hate more than everything is
The way I'm powerless
To dictate my own moods

I've thrown away
So many things that could've been much more
And I just pray
My problems go away if they're ignored
But that's not the way it works
No, that's not the way it works

When I go down
I go down hard
And I take everything I've learned
And teach myself some disregard
When I go down
It hurts to hit the bottom
And all the things that got me there
I think, "If only I had fought them."
If and when I can
Clear myself of this clouded mind
I'll watch myself settle down
Into a place where
Peace can search me out and find
That I'm so ready to be found

I've thrown away
The hope I had in friendships
I've thrown away
So many things that could have been much more
I've thrown away the secret
To find an end to this
And I just pray
My problems go away if they're ignored
But that's not the way it works
No, that's not the way it works

When I go down (When I go down)
I go down hard (I go down hard)
And I take everything I've learned
And teach myself some disregard
When I go down (When I go down)
It hurts to hit the bottom
And all the things that got me there
I think, "If only I had fought them."
Any control I thought I had
Just slips right through my hands
While my ever-present conscience
Shakes it's head and reprimands me
Reprimands me
Then and there
I confess
I'll blame all this on my selfishness
Yet You love me
And that consumes me
And I'll stand up again
And do so willingly

You give me hope
And hope, it gives me life
You touch my heavy heart
And when You do You make it light
As I exhale (Ah)
I hear Your voice
And I answer You (Ah)
Though I hardly make a noise
And from my lips (Ah)
The words I choose to say
Seem pathetic (Ah)
But it's a fallen man's praise
'Cause I love You
Oh God, I love You
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba
And life is now worth living (Ba-ba-ba)
If only because of You (Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)
And when they say that I am dead and gone (Ba-ba-ba)
It won't be further from the truth (Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba)

When I go down
I lift my eyes to You
I won't look very far
'Cause You'll be there
With open arms
To lift me up again
To lift me up againEmbed
