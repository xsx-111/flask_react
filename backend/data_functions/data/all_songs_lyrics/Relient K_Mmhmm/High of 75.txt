High of 75 Lyrics
We were talking together
I said, "What's up with this weather?"
Don't know whether or not
How sad I just got
Was on my own volition?
Or if I'm just missin' the sun
And tomorrow, I know will be rainy at best
And the forecast, I know is that I'll be depressed
But I'll wait outside hopin' that I'll catch sight of the sun

Because on and off
The clouds have fought for control over the sky
And lately the weather has been so bi-polar
And consequently, so have I

And now I'm sunny with a high of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light
And it's funny how you find you enjoy your life
When you're happy to be alive

And the temperature is freezing
And then, after dark
There's a cold frost sweeping
In over my heart
And we might break up if I don't wake up to the sun
Because on and off
The clouds have fought for control over the sky
And lately the weather has been so bi-polar
And consequently, so have I

But now I'm sunny with a high of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light
And it's funny how you find you enjoy your life
When you're happy to be alive
Sunny with a high of 75
Since You took my heavy heart
And made it light (Made it light)
And its funny how you find you enjoy your life
When you're happy to be alive1Embed
