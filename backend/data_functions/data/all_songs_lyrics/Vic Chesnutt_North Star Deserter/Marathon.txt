Marathon LyricsTo-do lists on a long yellow legal pad
Blue Windsor knot framed by basic black
Resplendent table
Great forests of paper plates
Carrying the weight of the world
Saps every ounce of your strength
In training to run a marathon
Miles and miles and miles
With your Sunday shoes on
In training to run a marathon
Miles and miles and miles
With your dress shoes on
But all these recurring dreams
Will increase and then peter out and cease
Tears do evaporate
But oh so slowly
Like piss on a toilet seat
In training to run a marathon
Miles and miles and miles
With your Sunday shoes on
In training to run a marathon
Miles and miles and miles
With your dress shoes onEmbed
