Fodder On Her Wings LyricsA bird fell to earth
Reincarnated from her birth
With fodder on her wings
She had dust inside her brains
She flitted here and there
United States, France, Switzerland, England, everywhere
With fodder on her wings
And dust inside her brains
Oh how sad. Oh how sad. Oh how sad
She watched the people, how they live
They'd forgotten how, how to give, how to give
They had fodder on their wings
And dust inside their brains
Oh how sad. Oh how sad. Oh how sad
Oh how sad. Oh how sad. Oh how sadEmbed
