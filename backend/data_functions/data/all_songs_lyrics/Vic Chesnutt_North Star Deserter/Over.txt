Over LyricsIt ain't over till it's over
Just like some joker said
When it's over, it is done
When it's done, it's as good as dead
When it's good, the show is good
Yes, and when it's good it's great
When it's great, it's woah, so wonderful
But when it ain't, it ain't
It sucks when it's over
And you can't get it back
Why do we all want to
Like a pack of necrophiliacs?
When the fat lady sings
It's all been sung
Collect up your belongings
And clear the auditorium
It was fun while it lasted
Yes it was
It was fun while it lasted
Now it's all turned to dust
It was fun while it lasted
I must say
It was fun while it lasted
Now it's all blown away
Everything blows away someday
Everything turns to dust
Big old mountains do
As well as every one of us
And I love the dustEmbed
