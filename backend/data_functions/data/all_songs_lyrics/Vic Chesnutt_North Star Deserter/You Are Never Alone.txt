You Are Never Alone Lyrics
It's okay, you can take a condom
It's okay, you can take a valtrex
And it's okay, you can get an abortion
And then keep on keepin' on
And then keep on keepin' on
It's okay, you can take a prilosec
And it's okay, you can take biaxin
It's okay, you can get a quadruple bypass
And then keep on keepin' on
And then keep on keepin' on

You are never alone
You are never alone
You are never alone
You are

It's okay in moderation
It's okay cuttin' down
It's okay, you can quit tomorrow
But for now, keep on keepin' on
But for now, keep on keepin' on
It's okay, you can take the bible
And it's okay, you can be saved
And it's okay, you can be forgiven
And for now, keep on keepin' on
For now, keep on keepin' on
You are never alone
You are never alone
You are never alone
You areEmbed
