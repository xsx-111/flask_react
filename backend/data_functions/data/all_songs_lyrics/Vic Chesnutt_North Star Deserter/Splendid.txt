Splendid LyricsIn the pasture, we run free
By the spring creek, we lie down
In the pine thicket, we are pricked
In the dry wash, we come across
An incomplete set of bleached bones
Splendidly full of life
Wandering the countryside
Splendidly full of life
Wandering the countryside
Splendidly full of life
Wandering the countryside
Splendidly full of life
Wandering the countryside
Down the lugging road we stray
In the orchard, we feast
To the rocky ridge we persist
As the sun sets, we are enveloped by
Oddly energised orange light
Splendidly full of life
Wandering the countryside
Splendidly full of life
Wandering the countryside
Splendidly full of life
Wandering the countryside
Splendidly full of life
Wandering the countryside
On the beach, we had fun
By the rocks, in the sun
We were young, we were free
We were wild as the weeds
Below cliffs, surrounded by driftwood
We did everything we could
We did everything we, everything we could
We did everything we, everything we could
We did everything we, everything we could
We did everything we, everything we couldEmbed
