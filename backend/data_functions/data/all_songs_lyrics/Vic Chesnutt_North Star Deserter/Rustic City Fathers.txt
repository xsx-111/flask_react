Rustic City Fathers LyricsThose rustic city fathers were realtors
Realtors
And all that profit taking
Was a beautiful awakening
They built themselves a beauty by the ton
Ton by ton
I went there in a panic or for fun
Or for fun
I thought I had a calling
Anyway I just kept dialling
And I sat beside the big puddle like a Shriner
Angry Shriner
So I went to view the tower
Its majesty on a dead end street
It was a very long journey
And it took a lot of energy
I strode across the flat battlefield in the sun
The filthy sunEmbed
