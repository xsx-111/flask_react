Everything I Say Lyrics
The barn fell down
Since I saw it last
It's rubble now
Well so much for the past

Everything that I say
Does me this'a way
Everything
Every little thing I say
Does me this'a way

Some call her a thief
And some people call her a prophet
But her courage is brief
Brief as little, little miss muffet

Everything that I say
Does me this'a way
Everything
Every little thing I say
Does me this'a way
She wanted to
Be an inventor
But nothing new
Was all she could muster

Everything that I say
Does me this'a way
Everything
Every little thing I say
Does me this'a wayEmbed
