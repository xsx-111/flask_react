Warm LyricsWarm, the body is warm
The muscles twitch
The posture compensates
And cold, the arrow is cold
The friction warms nothing
But the point is pure
The wound it is secure
Trial by error
Follow a sun
And the one we have will do
What is the message on those gamma rays
That are a-penetrating you?
Do they say that the end
It is a-coming soon?
Or do they say forget the sun
Worship the moon?
But whatever it is our pinhole prespective
Cannot a-translate sufficiently
But any way, A or B
You know, it's alright with me
But any way, A or B
You know, it's alright with meEmbed
