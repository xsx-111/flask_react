Magic Touch Lyrics
Somebody better call a doctor, doctor
Or wake me up with a shove
I'm gonna knock you off you're rocker, rocker
Because I think I'm in love
I tried to get a message to you
But you walked the other way

I need your magic touch, don't you know
I got a habit and I can't let go
Feel the fire burning slow
You better get it while it's hot now, babe
'Cause I can't let go, yeah

Don't need no wedding with a shotgun, shotgun
So don't you push me too far
Don't try to take me for a fool child, who child
Do you think that you are?
You really got it coming to you
It's gonna come as no surprise

I need your magic touch, don't you know
I got a habit and I can't let go
Feel the fire burning slow
You better get it while it's hot now, babe
'Cause I can't let go
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't let it go

You never know what you got
'Til they take it away
I'm coming ready or not
Gonna get you someday

I need your magic touch, don't you know
I'm after you and I can't let go
Feel the fire burning slow
I got a habit and I'm back for more
Your magic touch, don't you know
I'm after you and I can't let go
Feel the fire burning slow
I got a habit and I'm back for more
You better get it while it's hot now, babe
'Cause I can't let go

Go, go, go, go, go...Embed
