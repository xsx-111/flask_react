Girl Keeps Coming Apart LyricsShe was a 42nd street walker
Hangin out down by a cheap hotel
See an old floosey flopping in the wind
Titties and all
That's right
She right peculiar
She try and fool you
But the girl keeps coming apart
She's so appealing
Right off the ceiling
Yeah, the girl she's coming apart
What did I tell you
She buy and sell you
Because the girl she's coming apart
She's so affected
I'm so rejected
And the girl she's coming apart
Don't, don't, don't, don't let it get me down
Don't let it get my down
She's just a screamer
A nightmare dreamer
Yeah the girl she's coming apart
She's like a call girl
Loose ends and all girl
But the girl she's coming apart
White lace and leather
She's so together
But the girl keeps coming apart
I feel sedated
Boxed up and crated
Because the girl she's coming apart
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Let it get me down
Don't let it get my down
So there she was
Buns up and kneelin
I was a wheelin and a dealin
My ace in the hole so to speakEmbed
