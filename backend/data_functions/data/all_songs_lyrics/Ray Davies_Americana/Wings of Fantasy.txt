Wings of Fantasy LyricsWhen I'm far away
In some godforsaken place
That I'm passing through
When my emotions turn to blue
I think of you
Living day to day
Building up the debt
Heavy in excess
Getting in over your head
Vicarious
Wish I could set you free
Over the insanity
Imagining you and me
Flyin' on the Wings of Fantasy
Ah, on the Wings of Fantasy
Live in denial
Chasin' the dream
Livin' the illusion on
The Wings of Fantasy
And up above a solitary Eagle flies
Symbolizing our forgotten dream
So high in the sky
But down here I just wonder why
Am I part of nature's scheme
Or just a man in a machine
Burning on a turning wheel
Livin' in denial
Chasin' the dream
Goin' faster and faster
But running out of steam
Livin' the illusion
Accelerating fast
The worlds in a blur
But we're finishing fast so
Fly on the Wings of Fantasy
High on the Wings of Fantasy
Driving through the nest
But feel an optimist
Hope we'll see things through
Imaginary distances me and you
Still we climb
Overland 'til we decline
Touch the sky, hopefully
Fly away on Wings of Fantasy
Fly on the Wings of Fantasy
High on the Wings of Fantasy
Fly
Fly on the Wings of Fantasy
Livin' in denial
Chasin' the dream
Livin' the illusion
On the Wings of FantasyEmbed
