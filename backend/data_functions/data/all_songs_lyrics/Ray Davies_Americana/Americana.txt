Americana LyricsI wanna make my home
Where the buffalo roam
In that great panorama
My baby brother and me
In the land of the free
Americana
In my schoolboy world
I always get the girl
On that great silver screen
'Cause since I was a teen
Ya' know I had this dream
Americana
Oh
Runnin' high on inspiration
Taken from those Wild West heroes
Full of expectations of the road
On that windin' trail to somewhere
Young and foolish though he did not care
What dangers lay in store and so
In the steps of the great pioneers
Over air, sea, and land, still I can't understand
How I'm gonna get there from here
Wherever it goes, it's gonna take me somewhere
Americana
Kentucky Moon
Montana sky
Sierra Nevada
It's an epic ride
But it's a long long drive
Americana
I wanna make my home where the buffalo roam
