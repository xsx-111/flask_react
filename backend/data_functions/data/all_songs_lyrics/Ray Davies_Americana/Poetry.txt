Poetry LyricsI just got back from a walk down the square
To the local Kentucky
To see what was cookin' down there
I looked around at the store
And the signs and the queues
Lining up for that 21st century fare
I kneel down and say grace for the comforts the world bestows on me
And the great corporations providing our every need
And those big neon signs tellin' us what to eat
In every shop window goods are designed to please
Oh, but I ask where is the poetry?
The day we met were (?) down the road
But we laughed and found comfort
With old books and (?)
And reading poetry out loud
Or watching old black and white films together
In the days before Blockbuster came
I hear you ran off and found yourself a rich handsome fellow
To supply you with all you require, your material needs
I hope your fairytale doesn't end tragically
And in a shopping mall somewhere
You'll be down on your knees
Cryin' out loud "Where is the poetry?"
I'm looking at the sign that says "Have a good day"
And I got too much on my mind, so many questions that get in the way
Everybody's lookin' for perfection
Once I heard a wise man say
To get sometimes, you have to give away
(Where is the poetry? (?))
I have read in the news someone said
That the great population is better off
Than it used to be
Better house, better food, better sex, and better higher education
But with credit card bills always on the way
And I just saw my gal with a guy in a fast-food outlet
They seemed happy together but I saw the tragedy
Maybe I'm missing something but
I'm too blind to see
She settled for someone who isn't so hard to reach
Now I'm on the fire of desire and the mystery
Oh, but I ask where is the poetry?Embed
