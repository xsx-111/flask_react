Change For Change LyricsAn angel waits for all of us
Up there in the heavens
And down here on this lonely street
Good and evil sometimes meet
Change for change sake
Change in the government
Change the environment
Change your life
Otherwise you're gonna witness
Look on powerless
While the elements turn up the heat
When the change hit the street
While we're on the subject
Standin' in the street
Hey buddy, can ya' spare some change for me?
Change for the world's sake
Transform and integrate
Adapt for the future
Change your path
Help eliminate poverty
Save humanity
So the future generations can inherit the land
And while we're on the subject of our fellow man
Buddy, can ya' lay some change in my hand?
I don't live life, life lives me
Always has, always will be
Time to change history
Shine on through our misery
Change for change sake
Everybody fightin' for the same gutter
That's livin' in the free world
Change for change sake
Rearrange the landscape
Shape your identity
Change the world
Otherwise you're gonna witness
Look on powerless
When the future generations turn
And wipe out history
And while we're on the subject
Of man's destiny
I want you to give your change to me
I don't live life, life lives me
Always has, always will be
Like a ship lost at sea
Shine on through this misery
Change for change sake
For angels and demons
Billionaires and beggars
For livin' in the free worldEmbed
