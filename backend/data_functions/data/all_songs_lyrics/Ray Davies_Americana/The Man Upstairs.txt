The Man Upstairs LyricsGirl I want to be with you all of the time
Touring relationships are fine when the
Hotels take care of the housekeeping
And you've got room service
But once you check back in to the reality motel
The dust appears on your furniture
The laundry piles up
And there's no room service to clear away the trash
That's when the tempers get frayed
The emotions get heightened
And the fights break out
Once we tried renting an apartment together
But that was also a disaster
I can't sleep when I write
My brain keeps working
The person in the apartment above me
Must have been an insomniac also
Because he was still shuffling around at 3 am
Amazingly he was shuffling around to the beat I had in my head
As if he were accompanying me
Then I decided to write this song for the unknown neighbor
The unseen person above me
As he listened to the fighting downstairsEmbed
