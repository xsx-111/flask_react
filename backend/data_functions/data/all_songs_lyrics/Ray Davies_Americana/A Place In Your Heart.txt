A Place In Your Heart LyricsHold tight, winds are blowin', coldest that you ever known
Cut through the rawhide right to the marrow bone
Strap a live (?) across your knees to the back (?) so your jaw don't freeze
It's a bitter bad lightning freeze
Who needs to ride a train
When we got the natural motion
That's gonna take us right across the line
Look at the plain, it's the flattest that you ever see
Whoa, oh
Hey, look at that big sky
Look at that moonglow lightin' up the Rockies
On the way to Idaho
Take out your fiddle, put your hand on the bow
Rustle up a pretty tune, put a rhythm in your toe-o
Ray speaking:
Hello? Is anybody there? Hello?
I can't explain
Am I letting my emotions get the better of me?
You're always on my mind
But I can't tell you that I'd willingly follow you
If I can't have you
How can I expect to have a place in your heart?
But I wouldn't be so bold
As to expect you to have feelings for me, oh no
I can't admit it to you (West to East, under the stars)
Cause then I have to admit it to me
(It's a thousand miles to the nearest bar)
An' I wouldn't want to bother you
(West to East, 'til we reach Valhalla)
'Cause then I won't have to admit how much (West to East)
It's bothering me (In the land of the free)
(See the sun up ahead, see the moon behind)
Place in your heart
(You were right on time with gonna' get there come rain or shine)
You're always on my mind
(In Omaha city)
(Soon be over the incline)
I can't tell you that I'd willingly follow you
I can't admit it to you (West to East, under the stars)
'Cause then I would have to admit it to me
(It's a thousand miles to the nearest bar)
And I wouldn't want to bother you
(West to East 'til we reach Valhalla)
'Cause then I won't have to admit how much
(West to East)
It's bothering me
(In the land of the free)
(See the sun up ahead, see the moon behind)
Place in your heart
(You were right on time with gonna' get there come rain or shine)
And I wouldn't be so bold
(In Omaha city)
(Soon be over the incline)
To expect you to have feelings for me, oh no
Make the most of nature's great highway
Rest 'til we see night turn into day
Move so fast, too bad that you can't stay
A place in your heart
Ray speaking:
Alright lads, I gotta phone home
Man speaking:
Hey, Ray. What's the deal?
Let's get this show on the road
Ray:
Alright then
I can't explain
(Gonna get a train)
Am I lettin' my emotions get the better of me?
(Take us right across a  plain)
You're always on my mind
But I can't tell you that I'd willingly follow you
To the end of the earth
Jayhawks:
West to East, follow that star
Thousand miles to the nearest bar
Rattlin' wind, hold on tight
Wrap up warm, it'll blow you apart
Pass that whiskey, stoke up the stove
Pluck that string, wiggle that bow
Midwest show, thunder and rain
Get to the East coast, turn around, head West again
Move so fast, too bad that you can't stay
A place in your heartEmbed
