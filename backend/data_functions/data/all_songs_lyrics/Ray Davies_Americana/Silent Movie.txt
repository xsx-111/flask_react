Silent Movie LyricsThe day before I left New Orleans
My neighbor from down the street, Alex Chilton
Came to say goodbye
We talked about songs and how much joy they'd given us
Before we left, he confided in me "Playin' songs
Is ageless
The song's never seem to grow old
You can sing a song that you wrote when you were a kid
And it's like the first time you've played it
It cheats time and makes you feel safe
But the reality is that things are changing in the world"
As we talked the TV channel began playing an old
Black and white cowboy film
We sat there and looked at the tv
Even though the sound was turned down
We didn't need to speak anymore
The images said it allEmbed
