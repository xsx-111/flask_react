Message From the Road LyricsHere's my message from the road
I'm travelin' to a new time zone
So try to call again tomorrow
Tell my kid I miss her so
Then I'll play in shows and singin' songs
But I miss the place where I belong
In another town, but still I find
That you are always on my mind
When night turns into day
There's another town so far away
Waiting for me on The Great Highway
Right now you're in a far country
With good-time gals who come and go
You'll party with the good old boys
Have a drink and act macho
Out of sight and out of mind
Always somewhere on the road
Wherever you may go
You'll have a place in my heart
When night turns into day
In your reality, I'll be just another memoryEmbed
