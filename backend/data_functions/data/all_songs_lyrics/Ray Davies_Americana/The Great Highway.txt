The Great Highway LyricsI had this dream America
Was always a very special place
Heroes of the great Wild West
Wild Bill Hickok and the rest
The romantic on a reckless chase
'Til reality hit me in the face
Hey, hey, hey
I'm ridin' on The Great Highway
All across America
From New York to LA
Hopin' I can find my dream
In New Hampshire or New Orleans
Find a place where I can stay
A'once I'm there I'm never goin' away so
Hey, hey, hey
From Promenade to San Francisco Bay
All across America
Along The Great Highway
Bright eyes like wishing wells
Instamatic kiss and tell
Optimistic self-belief
College girls with perfect teeth
Technicolor realism in 20/20 vision
Animated multi-race
And always out there in your face
Hoorah, she'll be cool if you upset her
And life is not a road movie
So wake up to reality and
Hey, hey, hey
I'm drivin' on the interstate
All across America
Along The Great Highway
And even if the dream goes wrong
We'll stay for the last song
So hey, hey, hey
From Promenade to San Francisco Bay
All across America
We're on The Great Highway
The great illusion it may be
But always somethin' else to see
Always some little hick town
To pick you up when you are down
Another day, another shake
Malted with a slice of cake
La di da di da di da (La di da di da di da)
At a jukebox in a smoky bar
A girl stands looking at the stars
Dressed in denim, wearing shades
And how sad is The Great Highway
(I had this dream, America)
She sips her Coke, walks away
It's just a second in her day
But all her culture's on display
She might be a dreamer
But maybe I'm a dreamer too
Hey, hey, hey
I'm ridin' on The Great Highway
All across America
From New York to LA
Hey, hey, hey (x4)
HeyEmbed
