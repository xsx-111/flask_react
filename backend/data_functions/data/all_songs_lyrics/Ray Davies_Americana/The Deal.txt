The Deal LyricsMan speaking:
I'm saying the people in this town have to be locked up. All of 'em. We have to leave and these people have to be locked up. D'ya know what I mean?
I'm going to LA, check into a quiet, groovy hotel
Get myself a tan by the sleepy pool
Meet a pretty girl, walk her down the strip
And chill out in the bar
Then I will rent a car
An open-top Mustang
To cruise around the beach
And I'll check out all the babes
While the sun goes down
By then I will be ready
To party and that's cool
When I'm emotionally refreshed
Relaxed and confident
I'll hit Rodeo Drive
And drink a cappuccino
And depending how I feel
I'll grab a piece of action
At the Beverly Hills
And get myself a deal
Isn't it wonderful, marvelous
Utterly surreal
Totally fabulous, fraudulent
Bogus and unreal
This is my lucky day
I'll travel to LA
And get myself a deal
Today I'm a bullshit millionaire
As good as anyone, better than I was
In dreary Angleterre, real but disillusioned
Traveling on the tube, riding on the bus
Now I'm full of self-belief
Pretend to be somebody while the credit's good
I will rent a mansion somewhere in Bel Air
Confidence abounding, looking really awesome
Truly debonair
It'll be wonderful, marvelous
Feeling really fake
Feeling so fabulous, fraudulent
A counterfeit on the make
Today I'm gonna get my break
Go to LA, strike myself a deal
And be part of the American Dream
It'll be wonderful, marvelous (wonderful, marvelous)
Woman speaking:
Hey Ray, what's the haps?(?)
Man speaking:
What's the deal, Ray?
What's the deal?
Ray:
It's been a while
I haven't seen you for at least a year or more
Or is it less? I can't be sure
But anyway
You must've heard about the troubles that I had
Still I got through, I always manage to
And by the way, how are you?
(Ooh, marvelous)
How is your life? How is it goin'?
Man speaking:
I still have to sign a contract
People in this town have to be locked up
All of 'em
Hey Ray, what's the deal?
Yeah, what's the deal, Ray?
(Ray)
The deal is...Embed
