The Invaders LyricsThey called us The Invaders
So we came from another world
And the man from immigration
Shouted out "Hey punk, you a boy or a girl?"
"Hey tutti-frutti give us a kiss"
The custom man proclaimed
'Cause the world as you knew it
Turned upside down, and things would never
Be the same
The day The Invaders came
They called us The Invaders
Like creatures from the black lagoon
Said that we were dangerous
Like space invaders from the moon
We just came to see the world
And entertain America
We just came to get a break
Not to turn into enemies of the state
'Cause the world as you knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
The day The Invaders came
They called us illegal aliens
As though we were punks (?)
And as we walked through immigration
They heard me speak and shouted out "You wait!"
"Hey you buddy, get back in the line"
His eyes were full of hate
'Cause the world as we knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
The day The Invaders came
They called us The Invaders
Like barbarians full of hate
Said that we were dangerous
Like warriors sent to pillage and rape
We all danced to a different tune
But they didn't like my attitude
Culture clash like chalk and cheese
Misunderstood in the land of the free
'Cause the world as we knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
'Cause the world as we knew it turned upside down
And things would never be the same
The day The Invaders the cameEmbed
