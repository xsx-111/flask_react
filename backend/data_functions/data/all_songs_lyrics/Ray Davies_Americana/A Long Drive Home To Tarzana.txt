A Long Drive Home To Tarzana LyricsNew England to Hollywood
Seems so far away
Like all roads lead us to California
It's a long long way to paradise, isn't it?
In the neverending for all perfection
And it seems like an eternity
Since we first turned the ignition
And made our way down the highway
Because I told you lies
It seems a neverending lonesome drive
And now the road is getting clear
The exit sign is very near
The empty spaces will lead us round
Hope we can find our new hometown
It's a long drive home to Tarzana
But once we're there we will see there's nothing there
Except that space
Beautiful space
We drove so far to find this place
It's a long drive home to Tarzana
This space that community
All freeways to Tarzana
No more ghettos or urban strife
It's fine with me
It's fine with me
It's a long long way to paradise, isn't it?Embed
