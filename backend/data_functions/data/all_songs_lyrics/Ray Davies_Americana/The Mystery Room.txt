The Mystery Room LyricsIt's the middle of the night
And I look in the mirror
Hey man, what do ya' see?
Hear the sound of the train by the river
Cryin' out "Follow me"
And the fall was not that bad
Run down the street, rain on my head
Since I was a kid, always wanted to see
Now I'm faced with mortality
Yeah, I feel a greeting
Yeah, my heart's still beating
Now there's no retreating
Comin' into the Mystery Room
Yeah, my brain's in a (?)
My body's in free-fall
Must be somethin' weird (?)
Short circuited, crosswire
Up on the highwire
Hear them play that honky tonk tune
As you walk to that Mystery Room
Yeah, can you feel the gloom
Liftin' in the Mystery Room
Yeah, (?) face of fear
Live in denial, turn around, get out of here
Medication in the hope it might disappear
But if you can't see it, ya' can't feel it
Meanwhile they're playin' my tune
It's rainin' out there, but in here it's (?)
Big black cars, coverin' us with gloom
That's why I hide in my Mystery Room
Don't (?) me
It's a moment too soon
Can't ya' hear the 
'Cause I'm here in my Mystery Room
Come and join us
We're here in the Mystery Room
Come and join us
We're here in the Mystery Room
Yeah, hear the music
Yeah, my heart's still beating
Now there's no retreating
Goin' in to the Mystery RoomEmbed
