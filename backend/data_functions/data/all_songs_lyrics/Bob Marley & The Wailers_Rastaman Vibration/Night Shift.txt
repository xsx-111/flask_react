Night Shift Lyrics
The sun shall not smite I by day
Nor the moon by night
And everything that I do
Shall be upfull and right
And if it is all night
It got to be all right
If it is all night
Got to be all right

Your mamma won't lose this one
You are the lucky one under the sun
If you make me move
Then you know you got the groove
All night, it is all right
All night, yeah! It is all right

Working on a forklift
In the night shift
Working on a night shift
With the forklift
From A.M. (Did you say that? Why did you say that
To P.M. (Working all night
Working on a night shift, yeah
(Did you say that? Why did you say that? Upfull and right
Well, if it is (all night!) - if it is (all right!)
All night (all night!)
Warehouse (all right!)
You are empty, yeah
Go around the corner
Bring your goods
Go around the other corner
Bring your suitcases (All night!)
By the sweat of my brow (All right!)
Eat your bread (All night!)
By the sweat of my brow (All right!)
Eat your bread

All night (all night)! All right (all right)
All night (all night)! All right (all right)
Oh, yeah! (moon by night)
Why did you say that? Oh, yeah! (Upfull and right!)
Working on a night shift
With the forklift. (Moon by night!)
Working on the night shift
Oh, yeah! (Upfull and right!)1Embed
