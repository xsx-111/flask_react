Crazy Baldheads Lyrics
Them crazy, them crazy
We gonna chase those crazy
Out of town
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of our town

Ah I and I build the cabin
Ah I and I plant the corn
Didn't my people before me
Slave for this country
Now you look me with this scorn
Then you eat up all my corn

We gonna chase those crazy
Chase them crazy
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of town
Sta-diddly doo dit stip stop steal dil ya do stop steal ya diddily dil ya di day
Sta diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly diddly do da dit sta ba do stop stilly di dread

Build your penitentiary, we build your schools
Brainwash education to make us the fools
Hate is your reward for our love
Telling us of your God above
We gonna chase those crazy
Chase those crazy bumpheads
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of the yown
(Chase those crazy baldheads out of town)

We gonna chase those crazy
Chase those crazy bumpheads
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of the yown

Here comes the conman
Coming with his con plan
We won't take no bribe
We've got to stay alive

We gonna chase those crazy
Chase them crazy baldheads
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of the yown4Embed
