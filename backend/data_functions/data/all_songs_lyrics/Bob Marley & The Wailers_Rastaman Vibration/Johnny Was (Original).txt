Johnny Was (Original) Lyrics
Woman hold her head and cry
'Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
From a stray bullet
Woman hold her head and cry
Explaining to her was a passerby
Who saw the woman cry

Wondering how can she work it out
Now she knows that the wages of sin is death
The gift of Jah is life
She cried

Oh, oh, all-la I know
Johnny was a good man
Ah-la I know
Johnny was a good, good, good, good man
She cried, She cried

Woman hold her head and cry
As her son had been shot down in the street and died
Just because of the system
Woman hold her head and cry
Comforting her I was passing by
She complained, then she cried
Whoa-oh, oh, ah
Yeah, I know now
(Johnny was a good man)
Said I know
(Never did a thing wrong)
Ah ah
(Johnny was a good man)
Can a woman tender care?
She cried
(Never did a thing wrong)
Cease towards the child she bear
(Johnny was a good man)
Oh, woman cried
Woman, she cried, oh, she cried, yeah
Can a woman tender care
Cease towards the child she bears
Woman cryEmbed
