Cry to Me Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-ooh, hoo-hoo

Cry to me, now
You are going to cry to me, yeah
You are going to walk back through the heartaches
You are going to walk back through the pain
(Shed those) Shed those lonely teardrops
The reaction of your cheating game

You got to cry to me, now
You are going to cry, cry, cry to me, yeah! Yeah
Lord knows how I get from the heartaches
Lord that leadeth me, yeah
And now I'm by the still water
You've got to cry to me, yea-ea-eah

You going to cry to me now
You have got to cry, cry, cry to me, yeah
You are going to spend those lonely hours
You are going to shed those lonely tears
(Walk back) Walk back through the heartaches
(Walk back) Walk back through the pain
(Shed those) Shed those lonely teardrops
The reaction of your cheating game
You are going to cry to me, now
You got to cry, cry, cry to me, yeah
Saying, (don't know) don't know - know how I get from the heartaches
(Lord that) Lord that leadeth me, yeah-eah-eah
(Shed those lonely teardrops) Now I'm by the still water
(The reaction of your cheating game) Going to cry to me now, hey

(Cry) Cry
