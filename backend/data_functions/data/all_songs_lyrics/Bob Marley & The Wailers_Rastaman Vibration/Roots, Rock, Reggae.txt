Roots, Rock, Reggae Lyrics
Play I some music (This a Reggae music)
Play I some music (This a Reggae music)
Roots-Rock-Reggae (This a Reggae music)
Roots-Rock-Reggae (This a Reggae music)

Hey mister Music, you sure sound good to me
I can't refuse it, what do we got to be?
Feel like dancing (Dance 'cause we are free)
Feel like dancing (Come dance with me)

Roots-Rock-Reggae (This a Reggae music)
Roots-Rock-Reggae (This a Reggae music)
Play I some music (This a Reggae music)
Play I some music (This a Reggae music)

Play I on the R&B, wo-ho-ho (Want all my people to sing)
We're bubbling on the top one hundred (Just like a mighty dread)
Play I on the R&B (Want all my people to sing)
We're bubbling on the top one hundred (Just like a mighty dread)

Roots-Rock-Reggae (This a Reggae music)
Roots-Rock-Reggae (This a Reggae music)
Play I some music (This a Reggae music)
Play I some music (This a Reggae music)
This a Reggae music
This a Reggae music

Play I on the R&B (I want all my people to sing)
We're bubbling on the top one hundred
Just like a mighty dread

Play I some music (This a Reggae music)
Play I some music (This a Reggae music)

This a Reggae music
This a Reggae music
This a Reggae music6Embed
