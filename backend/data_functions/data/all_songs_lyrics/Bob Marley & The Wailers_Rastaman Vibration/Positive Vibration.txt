Positive Vibration Lyrics
Live if you want to live
(Rastaman vibration, yeah, positive)
That's what we got to give!
(I and I vibration, yeah, positive)
Got to have a good vibe!
(Iyaman Iration, yeah, irie ites!)
Wo-wo-ooh!
(Positive vibration, yeah, positive)

If you get down and you quarrel everyday
You are saying prayers to the devils, I say, wo-oh-ooh!
Why not help one another on the way?
Make it much easier (Just a little bit easier)

Say you just can't live that negative way
If you know what I mean
Make way for the positive day
Because it's news (New day) - news and days
New time (New time), and if it's a new feeling (New feeling), yeah!
Said it's a new Zion (New sign)
Oh, what a new day!

Picking up?
Are you picking up now?
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)
Live if you want to live
(Rastaman vibration, yeah, positive)
That's what we got to give!
(I and I vibration yeah, positive)
Got to have a good vibe!
(Iyaman Iration, yeah, irie ites)
Wo-wo-ooh!
(Positive vibration, yeah, positive)

Picking up?
Are you picking up now?
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)3Embed
