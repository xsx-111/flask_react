Who the Cap Fit Lyrics
Man to man is so unjust, children
You don't know who to trust
Your worst enemy could be your best friend
And your best friend your worst enemy

Some will eat and drink with you
Then behind them su-su 'pon you
Only your friend know your secrets
So only he could reveal it

And who the cap fit, let them wear it
Who the cap fit, let them wear it
Said I throw me corn, me no call no fowl
I saying, "cook-cook-cook, cluk-cluk-cluk"

Some will hate you, pretend they love you now
Then behind they try to eliminate you
But who Jah bless, no one curse
Thank God, we're past the worst

Hypocrites and parasites
Will come up and take a bite
And if your night should turn to day
A lot of people would run away
And who the stock fit let them wear it
Who the cap fit let them wear it
And then I gonna throw me corn
And then I gonna call no fowl
And then I gonna "cook-cook-cook"
Mmm, yeah, "cluk-cluk-cluk"


Some will eat and drink with you
Then behind them su-su 'pon you
And if night should turn to day, now
A lot of people would run away

And who the cap fit, let them wear it
Who the cap fit, let them wear it
Throw me corn, me no call no fowl
I banging "cook-cook-cook, cluk-cluk-cluk"

Throw me corn (cook-cook-cook)
Me call no fowl (cluk-cluk-cluk)4Embed
