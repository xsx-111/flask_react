Whitewater LyricsAnd, when I'm with a friend, and I feel proud, and there's a proud me too
(2x)
Me too.  Right now, I'm the Loving Me; isn't he cute? And after I've done a real good job - I've cleaned my room, or something like that, and I feel proud, and there's a proud me too
And when I'm with a friend, and we're having a good time, then I'm the happy me
But when my friend has to go home I feel a little sad, so I turn into the sad me
Anyway, there sure are a lot of different me's, just like you have a lot of different you's!
Well, I'm going outside to - outside to play now, I hope all the different you's have fun too. Bye!
