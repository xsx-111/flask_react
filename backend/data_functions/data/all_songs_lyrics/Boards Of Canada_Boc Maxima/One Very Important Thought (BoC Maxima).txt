One Very Important Thought (BoC Maxima) LyricsNow that the show is over
And we have jointly exercised our constitutional rights
We would like to leave you with one very important thought
Some time in the future
You may have the opportunity to serve as a juror
In a so-called obscenity case
It would be wise to remember that the same people
Who would stop you from viewing an adult film
May be back next year
To complain about a book, or even a TV program
If you can be told what you can see or read
Then it follows that you can be told what to say or think
Defend your constitutionally protected rights
No one else will do it for you
Thank youEmbed
