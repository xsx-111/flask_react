Please Let That Be You Lyrics
Lost out in the machinery
Lifeless, slow and cold

Alone at home, alone too long
Walk around the complex
No visitors, no oxygen
Just me, no movement

Please let that be you
Knocking on my door so loud
Just like you do
Bringing a message or two
You know, you are my fave
And I love you

Empty, everything's technical
Sterile, and endless
Inside, I malfunction
Observe and obsess

Please let that be you
Ringing my phone right now
Like I wish you would do
Calling with some good news
You know, you are my fave
And I love you
You are my fave and I love you
Stand by my side, always be true
You are my fave and I love you
I'll raise my right hand and swear it's true
You are my fave
You are my fave
You are my fave
You are my fave

Please let that be you
Singing my song so nice sounding like you do
Just humming along to your tune
You know, you are my fave
And I love youEmbed
