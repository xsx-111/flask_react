My Summer Girl Lyrics
My summer girl
She was my world
He's got her now
Charmed her somehow

I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I'll never be your type

All summer long
Feelings grew strong
All through that time
I was not blind

I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I'll never be your type

My summer girl
My summer girl
My summer girl
My Summer girl

I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I know I'm not your type
I'll never be your type
I'll never be your type
I'll never be your type
I'll never be your type
I'll never be your type1Embed
