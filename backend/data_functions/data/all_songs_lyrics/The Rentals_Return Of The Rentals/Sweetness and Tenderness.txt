Sweetness and Tenderness Lyrics
I need to figure this out
And find where my place is
I don't mean to threaten anyone
No need to get so defensive

You say you're with me, I know you don't care
You say you're with me, I know you don't care

I guess it's real simple
It's just like when Gary Numan say
You're just a viewer, cold and distant
You are just business, you're worthless

You say you're with me, I know you don't care
You say you're with me, I know you don't care

Sweetness (Oh, sweetness)
I need some tenderness (Tenderness)
Sweetness (Oh, sweetness)
I need some tenderness (Tenderness)
You know it's just like Judas say
I've been your right hand man all along
My admiration for you hasn't died
I haven't forgotten how put down we are

You say you're with me, I know you don't care
You say you're with me, I know you don't care

Sweetness (Oh Sweetness)
I need some tenderness (Tenderness)
Sweetness (Oh Sweetness)
I need some tenderness (Tenderness)

Come away with me, come away with me
Sweetness
Come away with me, we can hide in peace
And we can finally rest

This melody's wrong and I do care
This melody's wrong, yes, I careEmbed
