Naive Lyrics
Is this it
Are we done
Must we carry on
Like such fools
Shameless fools
Is it finally over
Why when I call must it take so long
Many weeks sometimes months
For you to call me back

Feels so naive
(Feels so naive)
Feels so naive
(Feels so naive)

My friends were right
Should have played it smooth
Should have tried to laugh
Instead of being cool

Feels so naive
(Feels so naive)
Feels so naive
(Feels so naive)
I feel so wrong inside
Cause I rest my head to go to sleep

One more time, though I know it's wrong
Maybe you'll change your mind and everything is fine

Feels so naive
(Feels so naive)
Feels so naive
(Feels so naive)Embed
