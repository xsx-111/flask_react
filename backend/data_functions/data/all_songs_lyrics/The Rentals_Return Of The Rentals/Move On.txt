Move On Lyrics
Let's get up and leave this town
I just want to go right now
Once we get out of here
No one will notice that we disappeared

So what do you say we go right now
Get away from everyone that hangs around
They seem so insincere
So why don't we just leave them here

And move on (move on)
Move on (move on)

We'll find some new place nice
Some other city or the countryside
We'll make new friends in time
We'll pack up and say goodbye

And move on (move on)
Move on (move on)
Move on (move on)
It's been six long years
Six years of hanging about without a care
It don't matter where we go
Anywhere is better I know

So move on (move on)
Move on (move on)
Move on (move on)
Move on (move on)

Come on let's get away
So far away
Come on let's run away, run away
Run away today

And move on (Move on)
Move on (Move on)
Move on (move on)
Move on
Move onEmbed
