These Days Lyrics
These days
I may not be so happy after all
After all that I have gained
I still feel sad when I'm all alone

I may have felt back at the cave
I may not be so swift after all
All the chances you have given me
I just let you go

These days (These days)
I may not be so happy after all (After all)
After all that I have gained
I still feel sad when I'm all alone

I guess I've been like this before
Sometimes, I can't stand up and be a man
But God, why would I loose it now
When I need my strength at hand?
You know sometimes I can be real cool
All the words just seem to flow right along
But when that girl approaches me
Well it all goes wrong
These days (These days)
I may not be so happy after all (After all)
After all that I have gained
I still feel sad when I'm all alone

These days leave me hopelessly lugubirous
I wish these days would end, oh please end

These days (These days)
I may not be so happy after all (After all)
After all that I have gained
I still feel sad when I'm all alone
These days (These days)
I may not be so happy after all (After all)
After all the chances you have given me
I just let you go, let you goEmbed
