Waiting Lyrics
I'm waiting for something to come through
I'm hoping I can write a real sweet tune
No passion, no warmth in these words
I'm trying, but have nothing to offer

I'm waiting with nothing to do
I'm waiting, just a-waiting on you

Sadly, just like before
It's lifeless and soulless
And yeah, I fall way short
No beauty, no sweet melody
No four-part barbershop harmony

I'm waiting with nothing to do
I'm waiting, just a-waiting on you

I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you, you

I'm waiting with nothing to do
I'm waiting, just a-waiting on you
Waiting on you, ooh
Waiting on you, ooh
Waiting on you, ooh
Waiting on you, ooh
Waiting on you, ooh
Waiting on you, oohEmbed
