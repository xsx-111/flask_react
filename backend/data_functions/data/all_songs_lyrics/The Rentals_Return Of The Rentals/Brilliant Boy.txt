Brilliant Boy LyricsVirginia backyards, suburban life
Don't wake the parents of Potomac tonight
Rolled on the couch by the TV's light
In the basement, no one else in sight
I fear the day that I am not with you
Unlock the front door, sneak out the house
Down to Montana where A.C. hangs out
Feeling 15, feeling no doubt
Does your sweet voice let my youth out?
I fear the day that I am not with you
You're just a stupid girl, stupid girl
Stupid girl, I ain't no brilliant boy
You're just a stupid girl, stupid girl
I ain't no brilliant boy
Down to train depot, get in line and file
Goodbye Virginia with your lousy style
Goodbye my gal, same time next year
Goodbye my gal, I'll always love you dear
I fear the day that I am not with you
I fear the day that I am not with you
You're just a stupid girl, stupid girl
Stupid girl, I ain't no brilliant boy
You're just a stupid girl, stupid girl
I ain't no brilliant boy, stupid girl
Stupid girl, I ain't no brilliant boy
Stupid girl, stupid girl, I ain't no brilliant boy
I ain't no brilliant boy, I ain't no brilliant boy
I ain't no brilliant boy, I ain't no brilliant boy
I ain't no brilliant boy, I ain't no brilliant boy
I ain't no brilliant boyEmbed
