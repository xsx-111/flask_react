Fish and Whistle LyricsI been thinking lately about the people I meet
The carwash on the corner and the hole in the street
The way my ankles hurt with shoes on my feet
And I'm wondering if I'm gonna see tomorrow
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
I was in the army, but I never dug a trench
I used to bust my knuckles on a monkey wrench
I'd go to town and drink and give the girls a pinch
But I don't think they ever even noticed me
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
Fish and whistle, whistle and fish
Eat everything that they put on your dish
And when we get through, we'll make a big wish
That we never have to do this again again again
On my very first job, I said thank you and please
They made me scrub a parking lot down on my knees
Then I got fired for being scared of bees
And they only give me fifty cents an hour
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
Fish and whistle, whistle and fish
Eat everything that they put on your dish
And when we get through, we'll make a big wish
That we never have to do this again again again
Father, forgive us for what we must do
You forgive us, we'll forgive you
We'll forgive each other till we both turn blue
Then we'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
We'll whistle and go fishing in heaven
We'll whistle and go fishing in heaven1Embed
