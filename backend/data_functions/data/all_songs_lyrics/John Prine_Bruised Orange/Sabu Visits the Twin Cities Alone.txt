Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone LyricsThe movie wasn't really doing so hot
Said the new producer to the old big shot
It's dying on the edge of the great Midwest
Sabu must tour or forever rest
Hey look, Ma, here comes the elephant boy
Bundled all up in his corduroy
Headed down south towards Illinois
From the jungles of East St. Paul
His manager sat in the office alone
Staring at the numbers on the telephone
Wondering how a man could send a child actor
To visit in the land of the wind chill factor
Hey look, Ma, here comes the elephant boy
Bundled all up in his corduroy
Headed down south towards Illinois
From the jungles of East St. Paul
Sabu was sad, the whole tour stunk
The airlines lost the elephant's trunk
The roadie got the rabies and the scabies and the flu
They was low on morale, but they was high on...
Hey look, Ma, here comes the elephant boy
Bundled all up in his corduroy
Headed down south towards Illinois
From the jungles of East St. Paul
From the jungles of East St. Paul
From the jungles of East St. PaulEmbed
