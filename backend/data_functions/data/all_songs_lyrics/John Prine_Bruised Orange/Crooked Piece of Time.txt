Crooked Piece of Time LyricsThings got rough
Things got tough
Things got harder than hard
We were just trying to make a livin' in our backyard
We were born too late, died to soon
Anxiety's a terrible crime
If you don't come now, don't come at all
'Cause it's a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in
All in all and all in all it was a crooked piece of time
Yesterday morning an ill wind came
Blew your picture right out of the picture frame
Even blew the candle out from underneath the flame
Yesterday morning an ill wind came
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in
All in all and all in all it was a crooked piece of time
Things got rough
Things got tough
Things got harder than hard
We were just trying to make a livin' in our backyard
We were born too late, died to soon
Anxiety's a terrible crime
If you don't come now, don't come at all
'Cause it's a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in
All in all and all in all it was a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in
All in all and all in all it was a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of time
It's a crooked piece of timeEmbed
