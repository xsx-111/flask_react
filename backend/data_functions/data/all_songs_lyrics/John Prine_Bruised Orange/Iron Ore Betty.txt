Iron Ore Betty LyricsI'm going steady with Iron Ore Betty
She's goin' steady with me
We receive our mail in the same mailbox
We watch the same TV
I got rug burns on my elbows
She's got 'em on her knees
Yeah, I'm goin' steady with Iron Ore Betty
And she's going steady with me
Yeah, I been pickin' my brains out
I been workin' at the hardware store
I been trying to put a chicken in the window
Chase away the wolf from the door
Betty's been down in the iron ore mine
Bringing home energy
Yeah, I'm goin' steady with Iron Ore Betty
She is goin' steady with me
I been speaking to her in English
She's been speakin' in the English too
We always speak the same language
'Cause we're always gettin' through
I met her at a dance at the union hall
It was a night with Daddy G
Yeah, I'm goin' steady with Iron Ore Betty
She is goin' steady with me
I'm going steady with Iron Ore Betty
She's goin' steady with me
We receive our mail in the same mailbox
We watch the same TV
I got rug burns on my elbows
She's got 'em on her knees
Yeah, I'm goin' steady with Iron Ore Betty
And she's going steady with meEmbed
