There She Goes LyricsHey, there she goes
Well I thought she'd never leave
Heaven knows
You know it sure gives me the creeps
Well, I went and loved that woman
To the power of height
And we both got jivin' fever
Screwed our heads uptight
Then it came to blows
Hey hey hey, there she goes
Hey, there she goes
Hey there she goes
Just a walkin' down the street
I suppose
The next fellow that she meets
Should have her head examined
By an x-ray machine
So he can see all of those pictures
That I've already seen
Just so he knows
Hey hey hey, there she goes
There she goes
Well, there must be something somewhere
That makes me want to hurt myself inside
Yeah, we were a regular Dr. Jekyll
But together, we were Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
What a rough rough ride
Hey, there she goes
She's walking out on me
With all her clothes
Lookin' fine as she could be
Well, I seen her on down at the courthouse
I was sober as a judge
We'd tried to talk things over
But the grudge wouldn't budge
I said adios
Hey hey hey, there she goes
Hey, there she goes
Well, there must be something somewhere
That makes me want to hurt myself inside
Yeah, we were a regular Dr. Jekyll
But together, we were Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
What a rough rough ride
Hey, there she goes
Well I thought she'd never leave
Heaven knows
You know it sure gives me the creeps
Well, I went and loved that woman
To the power of height
And we both got jivin' fever
Screwed our heads uptight
Then it came to blows
Hey hey hey, there she goes
Hey, there she goes
Yea, there she goes
Hey, there she goesEmbed
