Ten Little Kids Lyrics
It all started one day
It came out of the blue
Everybody was talking
'Bout the bad things their
Moms and dads were doing

Ten little kids
On the side of the road
Laughing, running
Jumping, playing
They don't care what their
Moms and dads are doing

It began in the summer
I broke my arm in the swamp
Never fixed us supper
So we ran her down when we grew up

Ten little kids
On the side of the road
Laughing, running
Jumping, playing
They don't care what their
Moms and dads are doing

Yeah, ten little kids
On the side of the road
Laughing, running
Jumping, playing
They don't care what their
Moms and dads are doing

Ten little kids
On the side of the road
Laughing, running
Jumping, playing
They don't care what their
Moms and dads are doing
