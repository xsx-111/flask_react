Two Hearts Lyrics
Well, I know your name
Takes you back from where you came
Your words, they show
Sometimes it's real to be alone
So real to be alone

I survive, it's true
But when I get close to June
All right, okay
It's just two hearts that make us pay
Two hearts that make us pay


It's no better when you cry
Well, have you stopped to watch? She'll fly
Well, have you stopped to watch? She'll

I, I, I, I'm lonely
I, I, I, I'm lonely
I, I, I, I'm lonely too
Well, the love you need
I don't expect you to let me see
You held your grace
It's just two hearts that make us pay
Two hearts that make us pay

You appear so strong
Only faith could lead us home
All right, okay
It's just two hearts that make us pay
Two hearts that make us pay
Oh, two hearts that make us payEmbed
