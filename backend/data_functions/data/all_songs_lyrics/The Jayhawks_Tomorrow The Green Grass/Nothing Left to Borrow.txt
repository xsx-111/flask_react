Nothing Left to Borrow Lyrics
The ones you left behind are stuck in line
You've never been deprived of a smile or a time

Didn't you feel so wise for a while?
Didn't you feel that your ship had arrived?
There was nothing left to borrow
There was nothing left to borrow

Well, you follow where you're led, say you're using your head
Still making the rounds with the fools and the clowns

Didn't you feel so wise for a while?
Didn't you feel that your ship had arrived?
There was nothing left to borrow
There was nothing left to borrow

But you're still young with your eyes open wide
Couldn't you stick around for the ride?
But your mama always said
You gotta save your money

Didn't you feel so wise for a while?
Didn't you feel that your ship had arrived?
There was nothing left to borrow
There was nothing left to borrow
There was nothing left to borrow

You're still young with your eyes open wide
Couldn't you stick around for the ride?
Couldn't you stick around?
Couldn't you stick around?Embed
