Bad Time Lyrics
I'm in love with the girl that I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl that I can't live without
I'm in love but I sure picked a bad time
To be in love
To be in love

Let her be somebody else's queen
I don't wanna hear about it
There's too many others who know what I mean
That's why I gotta live without it

'Cause I'm in love with the girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love, but I feel like I'm living it out
I'm in love, but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love

All the stories coming back to me
About my friends and the people I don't wanna see
All the stories they just couldn't be true
Least not until I hear them from you
'Cause I'm in love with the girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love, but I feel like I'm living it out
I'm in love, but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)


'Cause I'm in love with the girl I'm talking about
I'm in love with the girl I can't live without
I'm in love, but I feel like I'm living it out
I'm in love, but I must have picked a bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
A bad time to be in love
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
A bad time to be in love
(Such a bad time)
A bad time to be in love
(Such a bad time)
A bad time to be in love
(Such a bad time)
A bad time to be in love
(Such a bad time)
It's a bad time to be in love
