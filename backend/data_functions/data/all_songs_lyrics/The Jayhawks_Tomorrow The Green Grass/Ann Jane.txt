Ann Jane Lyrics
Jane don't cry, your daddy'll be all right
Jane don't cry, your daddy'll be all right
He's there with you
How do I know? I walk with him

Supper will be at 6:15
Supper will be at 6:15
Come home soon
None of those people know you're mine

Ann Jane don't cry, Ann Jane don't cry
Say that you need someone there, my sister
Say that you need someone to be yours
Say that you need someone there, my sister
Say that you need someone to be yours

Beans and Jello, I made them by myself
Beans and Jello, I made them by myself
Please stay close
Many in this world walk with God

Ann Jane don't cry, Ann Jane don't cry
Say that you need someone there, my sister
Say that you need someone to be yours
Say that you need someone there, my sister
Say that you need someone to be yours
Say that you need someone to be yours
Say that you need someone to be yours, oh
Jane, don't cry
Jane, don't cryEmbed
