Pray for Me Lyrics
Pray for me that I may keep
Faithful to you in my time
Beloved, it is morn
Deeper yellow on the corn
Lovers work as children play
Beloved, it is morn

One fine day, I walked to town
No love like yours to be found
Idle days
Idle days

Heart and soul are full of light
Heart and soul untired always
Beloved, it is morn


One fine day, I walked to town
No love like yours to be found
Idle days
Idle days
Pray for me that I may keep
Faithful to you in my time
Beloved, it is morn
Deeper red on the thorn
May God keep you in his sight
Beloved, it is morn

Unknown steps before me fall
No love like yours to be found
Idle days
Idle days

Heart and soul are full of light
Heart and soul untired always
Beloved, it is morn
