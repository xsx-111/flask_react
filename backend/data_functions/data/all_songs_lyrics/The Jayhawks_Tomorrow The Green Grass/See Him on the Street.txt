See Him on the Street Lyrics
He never left a trace
They only found a note
Take the past nine years
Back from where they came
People call that suicide
Why'd I see him on the street today?
He kept his winter coat
It's cold outside in April

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

All this time away
From his wife's soft bed
Would it help to say I understand?
Why'd I see him on the street today?
He left it all the same
They say this boy is yours

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Take the past nine years
Back from where they came
If people call that suicide
Why'd I see him on the street today?
If people call that suicide
Why'd I see him on the street?Embed
