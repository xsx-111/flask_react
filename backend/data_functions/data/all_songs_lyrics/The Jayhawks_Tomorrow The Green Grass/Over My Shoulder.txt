Over My Shoulder Lyrics
Left running, you said you were flying
Left running, you said you were cold
Any statute you can name
Like the ones that I fell for

I've been looking over my shoulder
Would you love me? Then you're older
Would you love me? Then you're older
Still, I know you're true

The first game is lost, and you will
Another game is hide in your fear
Oh, please tell me how my heart
How can my heart belong to you?

I've been looking over my shoulder
Would you love me? Then you're older
Would you love me? Then you're older
Still, I know you're true

Every time that you look my way
I feel so homeless
Your dreams own me
These landslides and buildings too high
That block the sun for everyone
Oh, the law lives everywhere
And it lives without a care

I've been looking over my shoulder
Would you love me? Then you're older
Would you love me? Then you're older
Still, I know you're true
I've been looking over my shoulder
Would you love me? Then you're older
Would you love me? Then you're older
Still, I know you're true

Left running, you said you were flying
Left running, you said you were coldEmbed
