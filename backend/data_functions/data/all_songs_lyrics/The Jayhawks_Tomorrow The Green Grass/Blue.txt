Blue Lyrics
Where have all my friends gone?
They've all disappeared
Turned around maybe one day
You're all that was there
Stood by unbelieving
Stood by on my own
Always thought I was someone
Turned out I was wrong

You brought me through
And you made me feel

So blue
Why don't you
Stay behind?
So blue
Why don't you stop
And look at what's going down?

Lived by an old woman
She'd never sell me a lie
It's hard to sing with someone
Who won't sing with you
Give all of my mercy
Give all of my heart
Never thought that I'd miss you
That I'd miss you so much
You brought me through
And you made me feel

So blue
Why don't you
Stay behind?
So blue
Why don't you stop
And look at what's going down?

All my life (Stand by)
I've waited for (Stand by)
Someone I (Waiting round)
Could show the door (Now that I'm blue)
But nothing seems to change (That I'm blue from now on)
You've come back into my arms

So blue
Why don't you
Stay behind?
So blue
Why don't you?
Why don't you stay behind?
So blue
Why don't you?
Why don't you stay behind?
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So blue
Why don't you stop
And look at what's going down?1Embed
