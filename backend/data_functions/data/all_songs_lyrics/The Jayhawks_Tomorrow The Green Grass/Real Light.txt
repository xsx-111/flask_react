Real Light Lyrics
Keep my real light shining
Keep my real light shining

You were there to walk for miles
Then you went away
Look at all the ways we've been
And how we've been today
Shaking like a friend of mine
Roll just like a stone
Listen to your eyes and I'll
Always let you know

Keep my real light shining
Keep my real light shining
Keep my real light shining, shining, shining down
Shining, shining, shining down


People fight, criticize, follow in the haze
Look behind their peace of mind
Some things never change
Keep my real light shining
Keep my real light shining
Keep my real light shining, shining, shining down
Shining, shining, shining down
Shining, shining, shining down
