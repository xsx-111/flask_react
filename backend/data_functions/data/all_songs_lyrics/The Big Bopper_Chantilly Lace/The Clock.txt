The Clock LyricsThe hands on the clock
Are folded as in prayer
And I know, just like me
Ooh, he's wishin' you were here
In the darkness of my room
I could swear I heard him say
"Man, your baby's comin' home
Is she comin' home today?"
Well, you know I love you only
So these blues, I can't shake
Honey, that clock looks so lonely
As the tear run down his face
Will my baby come back home?
Will I sit here 'til time stops
With the only friend I have left
With my only friend, the clock?
Will my baby come back home?
Or will I sit here 'til time stops
With the only friend I have left
With my only friend, the clock?Embed
