Pink Petticoats LyricsWell, a-pink a-petticoats and a-ballerina shoes
Pretty ponytail, give me the blues
Drive-a me crazy, drive-a me wild
I love-a my baby 'cause she love me in style
Oh, the first time I saw this pretty little miss-a
She used to charge-a me a dollar a kiss
I bring all my money in a paper sack
Well, now my baby say, "Here your money back"
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Oh, pink petticoat, ballerina shoes
Drive-a me crazy, give me the blues
I go a-ring-a-ding-a-ding-a when my honey bun
Always say, "Aw, Bopper, you're the only one-a"
A-when you see me a-walkin' on down the street
I got my arm around my baby and she lookin' so sweet
I wanna put her in my pocket like a kangaroo do
Pretty pink petticoat and a-ballerina shoes, heh
Now everybody, have a fit-a
Yeah
Oh, pink petticoats, ballerina shoes
Drive-a me crazy, give me the blues
I go a-ring-a-ding-a-ding-a when my honey bun
Always say, "Aw, Bopper, you the only one"
Ah-huh-huh
A-when you see me a-walkin' on down the street
I got my arm around my baby and she lookin' so sweet
I wanna put her in my pocket like a kangaroo do
Pretty pink petticoat and a-ballerina shoes
Ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, yeah
That's what I like, baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, whoo, yeahEmbed
