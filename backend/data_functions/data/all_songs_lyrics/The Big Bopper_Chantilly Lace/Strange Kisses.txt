Strange Kisses LyricsI took a chance, went to the dance
Just lookin', lookin' for someone new
I thought you were home, knew I was wrong
But I was feelin', feelin' so low and blue
A few strange kisses, was all that I wanted, didn't think it hurt to fool you
A few strange kisses was all that I wanted, I didn't want to lose you
I left the dance with my new romance, but soon my little game was through
I looked 'cross the floor, and through the door, I saw you lookin' for strange kisses tooEmbed
