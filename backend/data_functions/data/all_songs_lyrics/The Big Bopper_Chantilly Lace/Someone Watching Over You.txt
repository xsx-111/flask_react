Someone Watching Over You LyricsIf you do your best to do what's right
And you don't have trouble sleeping at night
And the devil don't fill your soul with fright
And there's someone who's watching over you tonight
If you lend a hand to every needy man
And you treat him like he's your friend
And your conscience tells you you've done what's right
Then there's someone who's watching over you tonight
He'll watch over you as you rest your head
Angels will be sitting at the foot of your bed
If you do your best to do what's right
And you don't have trouble sleeping at night
And the devil don't fill your soul with fright
And there's someone who's watching
Someone who's watching
There's someone who's watching over you tonightEmbed
