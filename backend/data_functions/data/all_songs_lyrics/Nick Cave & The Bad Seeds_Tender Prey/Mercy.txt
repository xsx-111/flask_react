Mercy Lyrics
I stood in the water
In the middle month of winter
My camel skin was torture
I was in a state of nature
The wind, sir, it was wicked
And I was so alone
And just as I predicted
My followers were gone

I cried 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I got down on my knees
Crying 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I got down on my knees

Thrown into a dungeon
Bread and water was my portion
And faith - my only weapon
To rest the devil's legion
The speak-hole would slide open
A viper's voice would plead
A voice thick with innuendo
Syphilis and Greed
And she cried 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
I told her to get down on her knees
Crying 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy upon me (Mercy on me)
I told her to get down on her knees

In a garden full of roses
My hands were tied behind me
My cousin was working miracles
I wondered if he'd find me
The moon faced toward me
Like a platter made of gold
My death, it almost bored me
So often was it told

And I cried 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I dropped down to my knees (To my knees)
And I cried 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And it put me to my knees (To my knees)
Mercy (Mercy on me)
Have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I dropped down on my knees (On my knees)
Crying 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Yeah, have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I got down on my knees (On my knees)
Crying 'Mercy' (Mercy on me)
Oh have mercy, have mercy on me (Mercy on me)
And I got down on my knees5Embed
