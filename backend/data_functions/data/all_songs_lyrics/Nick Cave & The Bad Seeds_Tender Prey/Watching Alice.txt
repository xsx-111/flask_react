Watching Alice Lyrics
Alice wakes, it is morning
She is yawning as she walks about the room
Her hair rolls down her breast
She is naked and it is June

Standing at the window
I wonder if she knows that I can see
Watching Alice rise year after year
Up in her palace, she's captive there

Alice's body is golden brown
Her hair hangs down as she brushes it one hundred times
First she pulls her stockings on
And then the church bell chimes

Alice climbs into her uniform, the zippers on the side
Watching Alice dressing in her room
It's so depressing, it's cruel
Watching Alice dressing in her room
It's so depressing, it's trueEmbed
