Sugar Sugar Sugar Lyrics
Sugar Sugar Sugar
That man is bad
The road he drives you down
Sugar, it's a drag
The road it twists
That road is crossed
Down that road
A lot of little girls go lost
Sugar Sugar Sugar
Keep on driving on
Until the City of right
Becomes the City of wrong
Man, that stretch is long
You'll sleep and slide
That stretch will find you
Gagged and tied

Sugar sugar sugar
That assembly of sand
Like a lamb to a knife you followed him in
He will laugh
And hang your sheets to see
The tokens of your virginity
You'll be his queen for the night
But the morning you'll wake
With the Lords and high ladies
Of the bottom of the lake
Sugar sugar
Honey you're so sweet
But beside you baby
Nothing can complete
Sugar sugar sugar
Honey you're so sweet
But beside you baby
A bad man sleeps

You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray
You better pray, baby
Pray, baby, pray baby
You better pray
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray
Honey, you better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray
Get down on your knees and pray
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Oh come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Sugar sugar sugar
That man is bad
And that's the bottom baby
Coming right up ahead
You can smell his fear
You can smell his love
As he wipes his mouth
On your altar cloth
Sugar sugar sugar
Try to understand
I'm an angel of God
I'm your guardian
He smells your innocence
And like a dog he comes
And like all the dogs he is
I shut him down
Sugar sugar sugar
I can't explain
Must I kill that cocksucker everyday

You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray, daddy
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray, you better pray
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray, cause your daddy he ain't far away
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray, your daddy he ain't far away
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray, your daddy come to take you away
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray, get down on your knees and pray
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray, your daddy he ain't far away
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray, prey baby, tender prey
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray
Tender prey, baby, tender prey
You better pray baby
Pray baby, pray baby
You better pray2Embed
