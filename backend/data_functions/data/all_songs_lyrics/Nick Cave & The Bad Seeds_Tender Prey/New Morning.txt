New Morning Lyrics
One morn I awakened
A new sun was rising
The sky was a Kingdom
All covered in blood
The moon and the stars
Where the troops that lay conquered
Like fruit left to wither
Poor spiritual food

And the spears of the bright sun
All brave with its conquest
Did hover unearthly
With banners of fire
I knelt in the garden
Awash with the dawning
And a voice came so brightly
I covered my eyes

Thank you for giving
This bright new morning
So steeped seemed the evening
In darkness and blood
Let there be no sadness
No sorrow
Let there be no road too narrow
There'll be a new day
Oh yes it's today
For us
I thank you for giving
This bright new morning
So steeped seemed the evening
In darkness and blood
Let there be no sadness
No sorrow
There be no road too narrow
There'll be a new day
Oh yes it's today
For us2Embed
