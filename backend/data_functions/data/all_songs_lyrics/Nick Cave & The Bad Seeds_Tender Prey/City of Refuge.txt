City of Refuge Lyrics
You better run, you better run
You better run and run and run
You better run, you better run
You better run and run and run and run and run
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge

When you stand before your father
In a state of shame
Because your robes are covered in mud
When you kneel at the feet
Of a woman of the street
The gutters will run with blood
They will run with blood

You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
In the days of madness
My brother, my sister
When you're dragged toward the Hell-mouth
You will beg for the end
But there ain't gonna be one, friend
For the grave will spew you out
It will spew you out

You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run

You'll be working in the darkness
Against your fellow man
And you'll find you're called to come forth
So you'll scrub and you'll scrub
Hey but the trouble is, bud
The blood it won't wash off
No, it won't come off

You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
When you stand before your father
In a state of shame
Because your robes are covered in mud
When you kneel at the feet
Of some whore off of the street
The gutters will run with blood
They will run with blood

You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run to the City of Refuge
You better run, you better run
You better run and run and run and run and runEmbed
