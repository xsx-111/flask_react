Slowly Goes the Night Lyrics
Darling, that morning you chose to go
I woke in my boots and clothes
You dig in my cards, stole all my cash
Even my 500 dollar suit was slashed
And I just lay there watching the sun fall down from the sky
Not wanting to open the letter
But opening it anyway
And seeing those two words

Lover, lover, goodbye
So slowly goes the night
Next to me lies your body
Playing like a map of some forbidden land
And I trace the ghost of your bones with my trembling hand
Dark is my night
And darker is my day
Yeah
I must have been blind, out of my mind
I never never saw the warning sign
How goes it?
It goes lonely
It goes slowly

So slowly goes the night
Ten lonely days ten lonely nights
Come
I watch the moon get flayed each night
Till the moon becomes the skinning knife
The skins of my sins I send to cover and comfort you
I know of a heaven
But honey, I know of a hell
Yeah
I hang my head
I toss in my bed
I never never forget the words you said
One evening "I'm leaving"
And I laughed and checked her breathing
And said darling
"Go slowly through the night"
O baby I feel the heal of time
And it hurts
I wake to find you sitting right there
Cutting tangles out of your hair
Singing a song that's all wrong
Hey, but that's all right, I don't care
Darling I'm sorry
For all your misery
Yeah
I reach out and embrace
An empty space
A song that slowly slowly fades
Where goes it?
It goes someplace
It goes somewhere where it's lonely

And black as the night
Come on home, lets put things right
Put things right
I hang my head and cry, cry, cry
Darling all night I try
To seize on a reason for this mad, mad season
The nights they are so long now
I can't remember them being light
Call it sleep, call it death, call it what you like
But only sleep, only sleep brings you back to life
Yeah
I hang my head
I toss and I sweat
I never, never, never can forget
How goes it?
Well I'm going
Baby slowly slowly goin'
And we both know that its gonna be alright
It ain't you that has to cry, cry, cry
Mm
Ten lonely days
Ten lonely nights
O since you left my side, side, side1Embed
