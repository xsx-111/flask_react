Eye Hate U Lyrics
You have just accessed the Hate Experience
Do you wish to change your entry?
Very well, please enjoy your experience

I never thought that you would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
You gave your body to another in the name of fun
I hope you had some baby, if not, boo hoo

It's so sad but I hate you like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you 'cause you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you
Now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cause I hate you

I never thought that I could feel this way
To fall in love was a table reserved for fools
Say you're sorry if you wanna but it's all in vain
I'm out the door sweet baby, that's right, we're through

It's so sad but I hate you like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you 'cause you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you
Now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cause I hate you
This court is now in session
Would the defendant please rise?
State your name for the court
Never mind
Billy Jack Bitch
You're being charged with one to many counts of heartbreaking
In the first degree
I don't give a damn about the others
My main concern is you and me
Your honor, may I call to the stand my one and only witness?
A girl that know damn well she didn't have no damn business
I know what  did, how you did it and, uh, who you did it with
So you might as well plead guilty 'cause you sure can't plead the fifth
Now raise your right hand
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like you used to so help you God?
Nod your head one time if you hear me
If you don't, I'll have to use the rod
Anything to make you see that uh.. you re going to miss me
Yeah, you're gonna miss me
Uh, uh, uh, oh!
If it please the court
I'd like to have the defendant place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
The act of showing her how good it used to be
I want it to be so good she falls back in love with me
Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want you to pump your hips like you used to
And, baby, you better stay on the beat
Did you do to your other man the same things that you did to me?
Right now I hate you so much I wanna make love until you see
That it's killin' me, baby, to be without you
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was to be with you, ow!
I hate you
I hate you
Because I love you
Because I love you
But I can't love you
I can't love you
Because I hate you
I hate you
Because I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you 'cause you're all that's ever on my mind
I hate you because I love you1Embed
