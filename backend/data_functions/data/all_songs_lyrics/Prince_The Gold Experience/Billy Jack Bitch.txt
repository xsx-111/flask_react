Billy Jack Bitch Lyrics
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack, Billy Jack)(Bitch)
What if I called you silly names
Just like the ones that you call me?
What if I filled your eyes with tears
So many that you cannot see?

Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever really try? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)
(Billy Jack Bitch)

What if I told you that you're worth
Only half of what you be?
Would you come forth and tell no lies?
Would you come forth and talk to me?

Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever really try? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)
(Billy Jack Bitch)
What distortion could you let your pen forget today?
What misfortune left your heart so broken you only say
Words intended to belittle or dismay?
What if I say you lie?
Billy Jack Bitch (Well)
Open letters aren't the only things that open wounds
Long hard shiny rocket ships can fly you to the moon
Whenever evil wants to groove
Come let me fly you to the moon
Then you can see how love will bloom
Joy - it's in the dictionary
See "J" Billy Jack Bitch

Do you ever really cry? (Do you ever really cry Billy Jack Bitch?)
Do you ever really try? (Do you ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?)
Do you ever wonder why? (Do you ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?)
Oh, Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy, Billy, oh yeah yeah yeah!
(Do you ever really cry Billy Jack Bitch?)
(Do you ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?) Cry, cry
(Do you ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?) Try, try
(Billy Jack Bitch) Billy, Billy, oh
(Billy Jack Bitch)
(Billy Jack, Billy Jack)
(Billy Jack Bitch)
Uh

Yeah, uh
(Billy Jack, Billy Jack)
