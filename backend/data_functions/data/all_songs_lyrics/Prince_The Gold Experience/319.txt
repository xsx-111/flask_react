319 Lyrics
(319)
About time, come in
Ow!
(319)

Take off your clothes
319
Bet you got a body, by God
Come on, let me see
You ought a
My camera's going to get you when you get it good and wet
You ought a let me come and pet you so it lasts, baby
319

Can I see it, baby?
(Mmm)
Ow!

I got a good shot, put your leg on the chair (Like that?)
You know you're too hot when you play with your hair (Ha ha ha)
I like it
I just want to holler, scream, and shout
When you let your fingers do the walking in and out and all about
319
Ah hoochie, don't do that
You.. you.. you make me want to dance!
Now watch this

Lock the door and kill the phone
My camera, you and me alone
Will make a picture all will see and go
"Ow, 319"

Oh baby, how'd you get your legs to do that?
Ooh shit
(319)
319
You're just too mean
319
Yeah, yeah, go on girl
Ain't gotta tell you cuz already know
Girl, you in the house so keep running that show
Go on girl
Yeah

Come here
Have you ever kissed another woman on the dance floor?
Come here, where you going?
Come here
319 (319)
