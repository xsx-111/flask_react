Shy Lyrics
After a month of just being alone he said, "I wonder what L.A.'s thinking"
Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinking
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
The search was over at least for tonight
When she co-signed and then told him she was ...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Oh baby (Shy)

After a look much louder than words she said, "I passed my initiation
A friend of mine, he got killed and in retaliation
I shot the boy ("Pop! Pop!"), huh, twice in the head
No regrets, no sorrow - I'm going back tomorrow to make sure he's dead
Cuz if I don't, they'll call me a chicken, but you can call me ... "

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Oh baby (Shy)
Shy - Lips say no but the body say might
Looks like we're going to take the long way home..
Looks like we're going to take the long way home..
Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight

The girl was rough, but he called her bluff
And he told her not to know was better
Fact or fiction he wondered
And that's when the rain and thunder got wetter
And at the top of the page he wrote ...

Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
(Oh, say it now, yeah)
(Shy, shy!)
(Shy)

Ooh baby, don't you want to be alone tonight?
Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
Shy (Shy)
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonightEmbed
