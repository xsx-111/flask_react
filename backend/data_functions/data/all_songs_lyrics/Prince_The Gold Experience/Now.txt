Now Lyrics
Now!
(Freaks on the floor)
1, 2, 1, 2
Light up another one dude

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)

One two one two ninety four
I'm on the set, freaks on the floor
Don't worry about my name, it's too long to remember
I could tell you now but we'd be here 'til next September
Three it be like that, see?
This ain't about the trippers tripping like they know they be
This ain't about this, that, what, where or how
This about the freaks doing everything they wanna do now
Now now - what cha gonna say? now now - how you wanna play?

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
What you wanting to say? (Get funky)
What you want to play? (Get funky)

Three, four, three, four, 99
She the new hero cuz she's so divine
Unaffected by the system, she'd rather die
Than write a rap for some big booty heffa gettin' by
On that booty, instead of doin' duty
Aspire to be higher I admire so I fire
Cuz it's flyer to be hungry than phat
And take it from this sister, y'all take it from that
It's flyer to be hungry than phat
The ride up front is better when You've been in the back
And that's a fact
This ain't about this y'all, it ain't about that
This ain't about the booty movin' pumpin' the max
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doin' everything they wanna do now!

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
What you going to say? (Get funky)
Now you want to play? (Get funky)

40, 45, snake's alive
Say one thing, do another, it's time
We chill on that
No, I don't need a gat
I'd rather see your self-checkin' ass up to bat for another swing
Anybody can sing
There's more to genius than the word, my sister anything I would bring
Or would u rather dine alone well
If you change your mind, you can reach me on your video phone
It's a dime, as in dollars, and that's my two bloody cents
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doin' everything they wanna do now!

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
What you come to say? (Get funky, get funky)
Come on, now how you want to play? (Get funky, get funky)
Band!
(Now)

Sixty seven sixty seven
Freaks dance like they're in heaven
DJ don't stop the music, DJ don't stop the music
Fill us with de dope track, lick us, twist us, roll us in your mouth
Light us up and take a hit, light us up and take a hit
Mmm, suck us til we're dry
And when we're lookin' like a roach, hit the lights
Before u say goodnight though
Let's make a toast yo
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doin' everything they wanna do now!

Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)
