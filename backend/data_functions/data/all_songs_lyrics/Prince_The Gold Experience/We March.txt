We March Lyrics
Uno para todos, y todos para uno 
March, we march
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
March, we march
March, we march

If this is the same avenue my ancestors fought to liberate
How come I can't buy a piece of it even if my credit's straight?
If all the water's dirty and I wanna lay the pipe, my dammy
The river that I drink from, will it be the same as your mammy?

Now's the time to find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason and frees the mind (Yeah)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line
Next time we march (Whoa)
We're kicking down the door
Next time we march (Whoa)
All is what we're marching for
If this is the same sister that you cannot stop calling a bitch (Bitch)
It will be the same one that will leave your broke ass in a ditch (Ditch)
If you can't find a better reason to call this woman otherwise
Then don't cry, you made the bed in which you lie

Now's the time to find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason and frees the mind (Yeah)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line
Next time we march (Whoa)
We're kicking down the door
Next time we march (Whoa)
All is what we're marching for

(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
(Whoa)
March, we march (Come on)
March, we march
Yes we do!

Now we clarify forever, in other words as long as it takes
We ain't got no use for ice cream without the cake (Umm)
We ain't got no time for excuses, the promised land belongs to all
We can march in peace but you best watch your back if another leader falls
March, we march
March, we march
He said it, she said it and I say
He said it, she said it and I say

Now's the time (now's the time) to find a rhyme (Yeah)
That's got a reason (Yeah) and frees the mind (free your mind)
From angry thoughts, the racist kind (Yeah)
If we all wanna a change then come on get in line (Get in line!)
Next time we march (Whoa)
We're kickin' down the door
Next time we march (Hey yeah) (Whoa)
All is what were marching for (Whooaa)
Next time we march (Oh yeah) (Whoa)
Kickin' down the door
Next time we march (Hey yeah) (Whoa)
All is what were marchin' for

The fun don't stop the bacon
That's when the money going to stop the shaking
I know that next time we march, yeahEmbed
