Shhh Lyrics
(Uh)
(Mmm)
(Mmm, oh)

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

In the daytime, ha, I think not!
I'd rather do U after school like some homework
Ah... am I getting you hot? (Hot)
In my bedroom (No!) cuz then we'd have to stop (Please don't stop)
I'd rather wait until everyone's fast asleep
Then do it in the kitchen on the table top, oh!
We gotta break it on down (down, down, down)
Can you hear me girl?

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down
Can you hear me, babe?
Shhh - huh, we got to break it on down
Candle light - no (no), I don't think so!
The crackle of the flame will just spoil my flow
Besides, I can be your fire baby, yeah
Dripping all over you like a ball of wax, relax and let go!

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

Can we groove tonight?
Oh yeah, ah - we gotta break it on down (down, down, down)
Oh
Yeah
That's it, baby
Ah, you say you want to slow jam? (Yes)
Then listen up girl, yeah
I wanna whisper music in your ear
That'll rock your, rock your, rock your world, oh
What's my name, baby? (I love you) Yeah
Tonight I'll teach you baby, teach you baby, teach you baby
To scream it and scream it and scream it and scream it! Ow!
Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow, they better not dare
Shhh - we gotta break it on down

Ooh, yeah yeah yeah (We gotta break it on down, down, down)
Are you listening, baby?
Ah hear me baby, hear me baby
(We gotta break it on down, down, down)
You making me want to ... oh!
Uh (Uh)
There it is
Uh (Uh)
Oh yeah
All night long
Are You diggin' this, baby? (Oh)
Break it down, break it down
(Shhh - break it down)
(Shhh - break it down)
(Shhh - break it down)
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Sex is not all I think about
It's just all I think about you
Oh yeah
Sex is not all I think about
It's just all I think about ... youEmbed
