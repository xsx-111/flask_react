Endorphinmachine Lyrics
Ow!
Come on!
Yeah!
C-c-c-c-c-come on!

Would you please look at this mother next to me
Fronting more booty than Peru got keys
Damn, if I don't get that
Wait right there and I'll be right back
Got a new trick in the back of my car
It's kinda like a movie but you're the star
Lights, camera, make a scene

The Endorphinmachine
Go baby
The Endorphinmachine
Yeah, go baby (Go baby)

Tippy, tippy, tin my friend or shall we begin?
Step right up and I'll strap you in
Don't be shy, this won't hurt a bit
Unless of course you don't believe in it
As sure as the dippy dippy wave of my 'do
You'll believe in something before this night is through
Press one for the money, press two for the dream
And get ready for something that You've never seen
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby
The Endorphinmachine
Yeah, go baby (Go baby)

Tommy Barbarella, turn it on
Uh huh, uh huh

Hold up, wait a minute
Ain't no good unless somebody else is in it
You there with the cynical disposition
Perhaps you'd like to join us in a mission
Of fishing for logic in a think tank
Unless, of course, you're feeling like a punk and take the bank
But every now and then there comes a time you must defend
Your right to die and live again, live again, live again
Get up, get up, get in
The Endorphinmachine

It's alright, baby (Go Baby)
Don't be shy (The Endorphinmachine)
Yeah, I ain't going to hurt you
Go baby
Come on, come on (Endorphinmachine)
Well, I told ya (Go baby)
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby, go baby, go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Don't make me!
Prince esta muerto
Prince esta muerto
Que viva para siempre el Poder de la Nueva GeneracionEmbed
