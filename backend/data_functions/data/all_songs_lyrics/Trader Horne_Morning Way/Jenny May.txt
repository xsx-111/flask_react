Jenny May LyricsHey Jenny May, are you coming out to play?
I'm all alone and my daddy's gone away
I'll be Jesse James and you'll be an Indian
If we have a fight, I might even let you win
Jenny May
Hey Jenny May, coming out to play?
I'm all alone and my daddy's gone away
Jenny May
If you wish, you'll get a silver dish
If you hope, you'll get a skipping rope
But if you cry, there'll be witches in the sky
Jenny May
Hey Jenny May, coming out to play?
I'm all alone and my daddy's gone away
Jenny May
Hey Jenny May, are you coming out to play?
I'm all alone and my daddy's gone away
We won't play games in the rain
If it rains, we'll come back home again
Hey Jenny May, coming out to play?
I'm all alone and my daddy's gone away
Jenny May
Hey Jenny May, coming out to play?
I'm all alone and my daddy's gone away
Jenny May
I'm all alone and my daddy's gone awayEmbed
