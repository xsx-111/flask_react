In My Loneliness LyricsI'm sitting here in my confusion
I'm crying in the desert sand
I'm only happy when I'm sleeping here with you
(And it's so hot)
Leave me alone
(With my loneliness)
You used to sit and talk of freedom
The words you spoke were so sincere
But I was just a fool who wanted even more
(Than you could give)
Leave me alone
(With my loneliness)
But I was just a fool who wanted even more
(Than you could give)
Leave me alone
(With my loneliness)
You played and sang 'til the dawning
Your laugh was pleasant in my ears
The poetry he spoke is running in my head
(You should have said)
Leave me alone
(With my loneliness)Embed
