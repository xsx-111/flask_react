Velvet To Atone LyricsVelvet is soft as a kitten's mouth
Satin is harsh as a scream
In fancy clothes of cloth like this
Who knows what you dream
Your eyes seem as soft as a piece of fur
But they gleam as hard as coal
If your lips were to seek sweet words of love
It would prove you have no soul
So if you need a friend who will help you to win
This all that you started alone
Take care, you choose one with your kind of mind
And make sure you stay unknownEmbed
