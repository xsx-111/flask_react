Baby Lee LyricsBaby Lee, don't do me like you do
Baby Lee, don't do me like you do
I love you baby, you never treat me right
Takin' you downtown, you carried me through the mill
Takin' you downtown baby, you carried me through the mill
Now you wanna treat me, and treat me like a child
Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong
Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong
I love you gal, I just can't stand your way
Baby Lee, you know you ain't treat me right
Baby Lee, you know you ain't treat me right
You take all my money, wanna treat me like a child
Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong
Baby Lee, you know I love you
Please don't do me wrong honey
I love you Baby Lee
You won't treat me rightEmbed
