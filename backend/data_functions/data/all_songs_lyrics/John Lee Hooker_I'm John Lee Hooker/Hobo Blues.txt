Hobo Blues LyricsWhen I first started hoboin', hoboin', boy
I took a freight train to be my friend, oh Lord
Mmm
You know I hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd
Hobo'd a long, long way from home, oh Lord
You know my mother she followed me that morning, me that morning, that morning
She followed me down to the yard, oh Lord
Mmm
She said my son he's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone
Yes, he's gone in the world somewhere, oh Lord
Mmm
You know I left my dear old mother, dear old mother, dear old mother
She was on her knees a'crying, oh Lord
Mmm
You know I hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd
Hobo'd a long, long way from home, oh LordEmbed
