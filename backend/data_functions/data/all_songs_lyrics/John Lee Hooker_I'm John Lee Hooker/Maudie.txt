Maudie LyricsNow Maudie, baby, I love you
Oh, Maudie, baby, I love you
You've been gone so long, 'cause I miss you so
Now Maudie, why did you hurt me
Oh, Maudie, why did you hurt me
I love you baby, you've been gone so long
Now, Maudie, baby, I love you
Oh, Maudie, baby, I love you
You've been gone so long, 'cause I miss you soEmbed
