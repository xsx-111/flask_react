I Love You Honey Lyrics
I got something to say to you
I want to say that my love is true
I want to say that you need me
Like honey that I need you, because

I love you honey
I love you honey
I love you honey
Well, won't you fall in love with me?

I don't won't nobody but you
No one can love you like I do
No one can meanâ€¦.. for me
So say Yeah honey, make me free

'Cause, I love you honey
I love you honey
I love you honey
Well, won't you fall in love with me, Oh Yeah

Say, pretty baby, that you love me
Say your love is made for me
Can't you see that I need your love?
It's just your love I thank god for

I love you honey
I love you honey
I love you honey
Well, won't you fall in love with me?Embed
