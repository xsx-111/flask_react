Race for the Prize (Sacrifice of the New Scientists) Lyrics
Two scientists were racing for the good of all mankind
Both of them side by side, so determined
Locked in heated battle for the cure that is their prize
But it's so dangerous, but they're determined

Theirs is to win if it kills them
They're just humans with wives and children

Upwards to the vanguard where the pressure is too high
Under the microscope, hope against hope
Forging for the future but to sacrifice their lives
Both of them side by side, so determined

Theirs is to win if it kills them
They're just humans with wives and children


Theirs is to win if it kills them
They're just humans with wives and children1Embed
