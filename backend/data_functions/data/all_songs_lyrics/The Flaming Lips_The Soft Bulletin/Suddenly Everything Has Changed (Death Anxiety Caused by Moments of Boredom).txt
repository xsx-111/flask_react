Suddenly Everything Has Changed (Death Anxiety Caused by Moments of Boredom) Lyrics
Putting all the vegetables away
That you bought at the grocery store today
And it goes fast
You think of the past
Suddenly everything has changed

Driving home, the sky accelerates
And the clouds all form a geometric shape
And it goes fast
You think of the past
Suddenly everything has changed

Putting all the clothes you washed away
And as youâ€™re folding up the shirts you hesitate
And it goes fast
You think of the past
Suddenly everything has changed3Embed
