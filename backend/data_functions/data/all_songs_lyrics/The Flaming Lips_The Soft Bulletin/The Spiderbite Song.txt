The Spiderbite Song Lyrics
When you got that spiderbite on your hand
I thought we would have to break up the band
To lose your arm would surely upset your brain
The poison then could reach your heart from a vein

I was glad that it didn't destroy you
How sad that would be
'Cause if it destroyed you
It would destroy me

When you had that accident in your car
That whole thing just really seemed too bizarre
Dodging holes and telephone poles through the dash
A million to one that you could survive such a crash

I was glad that it didn't destroy you
How sad that would be
'Cause if it destroyed you
It would destroy me

When you fell in love, it was so sweet
So devoted, completely swept off your feet
Love is the greatest thing a heart can know
But the hole that it leaves in its absence can make you feel so low
I was glad that it didn't destroy you
How sad that would be
'Cause if it destroyed you
It would destroy me2Embed
