The Gash (Battle Hymn for the Wounded Mathematician) LyricsIs that gash in your leg
Really why you have stopped?
Cause I've noticed all the others
Though they're gashed, they're still going
Cause I feel like the real reason
That you're quitting and admitting
That you've lost all the will to battle on
Will the fight for our sanity
Be the fight of our lives?
Now that we've lost all the reasons
That we thought that we had
Still the battle that we're in
Rages on till the end
With explosions, wounds are open
Sights and smells, eyes and noses
But the thought that went unspoken
Was understanding that you're broken
Still the last volunteer battles on
Battles on
