Doctor Worm LyricsThey call me Doctor Worm
Good morning, how are you?
I'm Doctor Worm
I'm interested in things
I'm not a real doctor, but I am a real worm
I am an actual worm
I live like a worm
I like to play the drums
I think I'm getting good, but I can handle criticism
I'll show you what I know
And you can tell me if you think I'm getting better on the drums
I'll leave the front unlocked
Cause I can't hear the doorbell
When I get into it, I can't tell if you are watching me twirling the stick
When I give the signal, my friend Rabbi Vole will play the solo

Someday, somebody else besides me
Will call me by my stage name
They will call me Doctor Worm
Good morning, how are you?
I'm Doctor Worm
I'm interested in things
I'm not a real doctor, but I am a real worm
I am an actual worm
I live like a worm
And I like to play the drums
I think I'm getting good, but I can handle criticism
I'll show you what I know
And you can tell me if you think I'm getting better on the drums
I'm not a real doctor, but they call me Doctor WormEmbed
