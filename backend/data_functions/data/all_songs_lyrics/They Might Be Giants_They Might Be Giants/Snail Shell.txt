Snail Shell LyricsSir hand
Or is it ma'am?
I fell out of my right place again
And you
Considered me
And now I'm where a snail has to be
I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
Was it something you would do for anybody?
Was it what you'd only do for me?
I need to know because you see
I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
Friend
Look what you gave
And how can you ever be repaid?
How may I give you a hand
From the position at your feet where I stand?
So let me thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
I'd like to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
Was it something you would do for anybody?
Was it what you'd only do for me?
I need to know because you see
I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shell
Snail shell
Thank you
Snail shell
Thank you
Was it something you would do for anybody?
Was it what you'd only do for me?
Or was it something where you acted when you saw the need
And knew that there would be a way the act could be repaid?
And so it may, but for today, I want to thank you for putting me back in my snail shellEmbed
