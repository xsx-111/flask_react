Stormy Pinkness (live in Berlin 1989) Lyrics
Um, this next song, um, involves stomping on the part of the audience. Uh, it's a love song. The song is called "Stormy Pinkness," it's in 3/4 time, don't let that fool you. It's a waltz time, choose your partner, and stomp along
This is the tempo, like this. Stomp on- what's the floor made of, anyway, is it wood? Rubber? Right. So, you have to stomp extra hard. Why don't you shout the word "love" while you stomp? Love! Love! Love! Love!
I can hear the women shouting but I can't hear any of the men

Stormy pinkness
Human weakness
Fills my Johnny cup with gloom
Your progression
My digression
Forty days this afternoon
The things we cherish are small indeed
So much the larger the need
Stormy pinkness
Set me thanklessly free

Danke sch√∂n!
Thank you!Embed
