Boat of Car Lyrics
"Daddy sang bass"
"Daddy sang bass"
"Daddy sang bass"
"Daddy sang bass"
I took my boat for a car
I took that car for a ride
I was trying to get somewhere
But now I'm following the traces of your fingernails
That run along the windshield
On the boat of car

"Daddy sang bass"

Traces of your fingernails
That run along the windshield
On the boat of car
On the boat of car
On the boat of car
On the boat of carEmbed
