They Might Be Giants LyricsHang on...hang on tight...
They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be rain
They might be heat
They might be frying up a stalk of wheat
They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be brain
They might be washed
They might be Dr. Spock's back-up band
...To make the merry-go-round go faster
So that everyone needs to hang on tighter
Just to keep from being thrown to the wolves...
Tabloid footprints in your hair
Tabloid footprints everywhere
We can't be silent
'Cause they might be giants
And what are we gonna do unless they are
They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be bald
They might be snow
They might be something else in the snow
Hang on tight...
They might be giants (Boy)
They might be giants
They might be fake
They might be lies
They might be big, big, fake, fake lies
Tabloid footprints in your hair
Tabloid footprints everywhere
We can't be silent
'Cause they might be giants
And what are we gonna do unless they are
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)
They might be giants... (Boy)2Embed
