Dr. Evil LyricsEvil, evil is his one and only name
Evil, in his mind there is no other game!
When your name is Evil, that is good or so you think
But you're so very wrong
It's evil!
But being wrong is right, so then you're good again
Wich is the evilest thing of all...
Do you find his sudden ways, invite you? does he excite you?
If his contradictions should atract you, should he distract you?
Heaven help you then...
You're finished, it's the end...
There'll be no retrieval...
From the evil...
The evil
He will
Do
He's evil
He's Doctor Evil
His name is EvilEmbed
