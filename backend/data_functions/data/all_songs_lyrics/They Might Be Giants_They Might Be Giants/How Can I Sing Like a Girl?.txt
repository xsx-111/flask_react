How Can I Sing Like a Girl? LyricsBirds are calling to sing along
But my window's painted shut
And all that year of chorus taught me
Is out of style and long forgot
How can I sing like a girl
And not be stigmatized
By the rest of the world?
Tell me how can I sing like a girl
And not be objectified
As if I were a girl?
I want to raise my freak flag
Higher and higher and
I want to raise my freak flag
And never be alone
Never be alone
From the watchtowers I've been spotted
Fingers pointing at my mouth
Spotlights turn and pivot towards me
But I dare not make a sound
How can I sing like a girl
And not be stigmatized
By the rest of the world?
Tell me how can I sing like a girl
And not be objectified
As if I were a girl?
I want to raise my freak flag
Higher and higher and
I want to raise my freak flag
And never be alone
Never be alone
How can I sing like a girl
And not be stigmatized
By the rest of the world?
Tell me how can I sing like a girl
And not be objectified
As if I were a girl?
How can I sing like a girl
How can I sing like a girl
How can I sing like a girl
How can I sing like a girlEmbed
