I Can Hear You Lyrics
I can hear you by They Might Be Giants
Made at the Edison laboratories
Two three four...
I can hear you just barely hear you
I can just barely hear you
This is a warning, step away from the car
This car is protected by Viper
Guess where I am? I'm calling from the plane
I'll call you when I get there
You won't hear a buzz but I'm buzzing you in
I'm buzzing you in
What's your order? I can super size that
Please bring your car around
I can hear you, just barely hear you
I can just barely hear youEmbed
