Particle Man LyricsParticle Man, Particle Man
Doing the things a particle can
What's he like? It's not important
Particle Man
Is he a dot, or is he a speck?
When he's underwater does he get wet?
Or does the water get him instead?
Nobody knows, Particle Man
Triangle Man, Triangle Man
Triangle Man hates Particle Man
They have a fight, Triangle wins
Triangle Man
Universe Man, Universe Man
Size of the entire universe, man
Usually kind to smaller man
Universe Man
He's got a watch with a minute hand
Millennium hand and an eon hand
And when they meet it's a happy land
Powerful man, Universe Man
Person Man, Person Man
Hit on the head with a frying pan
Lives his life in a garbage can
Person Man
Is he depressed or is he a mess?
Does he feel totally worthless?
Who came up with Person Man?
Degraded man, Person Man
Triangle Man, Triangle Man
Triangle Man hates Person Man
They have a fight, Triangle wins
