Bangs LyricsBangs
Above your eyes your hair hangs
Blow my mind your royal flyness
I dig your bangs
Bangs
To drape across your forehead
To swing concordant angles
As you incline your head
Once with a girl I fell in love
Sometime ago now she had
Bangs
Are that on which the world hangs (bangs)
I'm only holding your hand (bangs)
So I can look at your bangs
Bangs (bangs)
Are like a pocket T-shirt (bangs)
As casual as that while (bangs)
Fully intentional (bangs)
And in case you think
I'm here 'cause I like making chit chat
Just remember what I said
The money's under your hat
Bangs
Are that on which the world hangs
I'm only holding your hand (so I can look)
So I can look at your bangs
Bangs (bangs)
Above your eyes your hair hangs
Blow my mind your royal flyness
I dig your bangs
Bangs
To drape across your forehead
To swing concordant angles
As you incline your head (bangs)
And although I liked you anyway
Check out your haircut
A proscenium to stage a face
That needs no makeup
Bangs (bangs)
Are that on which the world hangs (bangs)
I'm only holding your hand (so I can look)
So I can look at your bangs
I'm only holding your hand (bangs)
So I can look at your bangsEmbed
