New York City Lyrics
You called me last night on the telephone
And I was glad to hear from you cause I was all alone
You said, "It's snowing, it's snowing! God, I hate this weather"
Now I walk through blizzards just to get us back together

We met in the springtime at a rock and roll show
It was on the Bowery when it was time to go
We kissed on the subway in the middle of the night
I held your hand, you held mine, it was the best night of my life

Because everyone's your friend in New York City
And everything looks beautiful when you're young and pretty
The streets are paved with diamonds and there's just so much to see
But the best thing about New York City is you and me

Statue of Liberty, Staten Island ferry, Co-op City, Katz's and Tiffany's
Central Park, Brooklyn Bridge, the Empire State, where Dylan lived
Coney Island and Times Square, Rockefeller Center
Wish I was there

You wrote me a letter just the other day
You said, "Springtime is coming soon so why don't you come to stay"
I packed my stuff, it's on the bus, I can't believe it's true
I'm three days from New York City and I'm three days from you
