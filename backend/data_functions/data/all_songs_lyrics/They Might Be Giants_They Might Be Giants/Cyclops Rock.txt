Cyclops Rock Lyrics
I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
(And then you go)
And waste my cyclops time
Mess up my cyclops mind

I'm sick like Chuckie was sick
My defeated heart keeps beating on
I won't die, like Chuckie won't die
But I'm not here to socialize
Gotta find a new place to hang out
Because I'm tired of living in hell

I'm a mess since you cut me out
But Chuckie's arm keeps me company
I'm a fright with my tombstone smile
All the children run away from me
Gotta find new friends to hang with
'Cause you're all afraid of me

I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
(And then you go)
And waste my cyclops time
And mess up my cyclops mind
Dan!
It was sweet like lead paint is sweet
But the after-effect left me paralyzed
I just stare with my one glass eye
Hoping you won't be back again
There's a whole new generation waiting to be wrecked by you

I taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
And waste my cyclops time
And mess up my cyclops mind

Pony, Twist, Monkey, and Frug
These are the things that I taught to you
Hitchhike, Boogie, Hypocrite Bop
I'm stuck in a van outside of New York
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Taught you how to cyclops rock
And then you go and turn around and break my heart
You waste my cyclops time
And I've got a cyclops mind
YeahEmbed
