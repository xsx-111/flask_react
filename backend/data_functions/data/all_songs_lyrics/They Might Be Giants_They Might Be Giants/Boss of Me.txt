Boss of Me Lyrics
Yes, no, maybe
I don't know
Can you repeat the question?

You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
And you're not so big
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
And you're not so big

Life is unfair
So I just stare at the stain on the wall
Where the TV'd been
But ever since we've moved in
It's been empty

Why I
Why I'm in this room
There is no point explaining
You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
And you're not so big

Life is a test
But I confess
I like this mess I've made so far
Grade on a curve
And you'll observe
I'm right below the horizon

Yes, no, maybe
I don't know
Can you repeat the question?

You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
And you're not so big
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
And you're not so big
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
And you're not so big
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
And you're not so big
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
You're not the boss of me now
And you're not so big
Life is unfair3Embed
