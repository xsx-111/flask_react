Number Three Lyrics
There's only two songs in me and I just wrote the third
Don't know where I got the inspiration or how I wrote the words
Spent my whole life just digging up my music's shallow grave
For the two songs in me and the third one I just made

A rich man once told me, "Hey, life's a funny thing"
A poor man once told me that he can't afford to speak
Now I'm in the middle like a bird without a beak

Cause there's just two songs in me and I just wrote the third
Don't know where I got the inspiration or how I wrote the words
Spent my whole life just digging up my music's shallow grave
For the two songs in me and the third one I just made

So I went to the President, and I asked old what's-his-name
Has he ever gotten writer's block or something like the same
He just started talking like he was on TV
"If there's just two songs in ya, boy, whaddaya want from me?"

So I bought myself some denim pants and a silver guitar
But I politely told the ladies, "You'll still have to call me Sir
Because I have to keep my self-respect - I'll never be a star
Cause there's just two songs in me and this is Number Three"Embed
