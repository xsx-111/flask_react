Pet Name LyricsYou gave me a pet name
Which is not to say I like it
We met at a party
Not to say I was invited
You said love was just a lie
But I could tell that you were lying
And we
Almost figured out how we'd get along
And given time we'd
Find it strange to
Be alone and
You work in a hotel
At the magazine concession
Back in just five minutes
Reads the sign above your station
Slip your profits in a bag
And you're looking up to the hour hand then we
Almost figured out how we'd get along
And given time we'd
Find it strange to
Be alone and
You just forgot your one pet name for me
And all those promises you said you'd keep
And it's a lucky thing
Because that sentimental stuff
Doesn't suit you
At all
Waiting at the bus stop
For just about an hour
Strategies for hangman
Cat's cradle, origami
You say I'm OK for a guy
But I could tell that you are lying
And we
Almost figured out how we'd get along
And given time we'd
Find it strange to
Be alone and
You just forgot your one pet name for me
And all those promises you said you'd keep
And it's a lucky thing
Because that sentimental stuff
Doesn't
You just forgot your one pet name for me
And all those promises you said you'd keep
And it's a lucky thing
Because that sentimental stuff
Doesn't suit you
At allEmbed
