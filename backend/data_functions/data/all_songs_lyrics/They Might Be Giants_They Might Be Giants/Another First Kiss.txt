Another First Kiss Lyrics
I'm asleep but she's talking to me
She's walking around wearing all of my clothes
As she runs out of things to say
And grabs my coat to walk away

"How about another first kiss?" she said
"How about another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How about another first kiss

Other people were too sentimental
Always worrying about their hair
Got tired of wasting all my time
Now I'm not worrying at all

"How about another first kiss?" she said
"How about another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How about another first kiss

You could tell me we belong together
And I could tell you, you belong with me
But we've run out of things to say
And we'll be happy anyway, so
"How about another first kiss?" she said
"How about another first kiss?" I said
I want another first kiss like this
How about another first kissEmbed
