The Statue Got Me High Lyrics
The statue got me high
The statue got me high
The monument of granite
Sent a beam into my eye
The statue made me die
The statue made me die
It took my hand it killed me
And it turned me to the sky

The stone it called to me
(and now I see the things the stone has shown to me)
A rock that spoke a word
(an animated mineral it can be heard)
And though I once preferred a human being's company
They pale before the monolith that towers over me

The statue got me high
The statue got me high
The truth is where the sculptor's chisel
Chipped away the lie
The statue made me fry
The statue made me fry
My coat contained a furnace
Where there used to be a guy
The stone it called to me
(and now I see the things the stone has shown to me)
A rock that spoke a word
(an animated mineral it can be heard)
And as the screaming fire engine siren filled the air
The evidence had vanished from my charred and smoking chair

And what they found
Was just a statue standing
Where the statue got me high

And now it is your turn
(your turn to hear the stone and then your turn to burn)
The stone it calls to you
(you can't refuse to do the things it tells you to)
And as the screaming fire engine siren fills the air
The evidence will vanish from your charred and smoking chair

And what they found
Was just a statue standing
Where the statue got me high
And what they'll find
Is just a statue standing
Where the statue got you
