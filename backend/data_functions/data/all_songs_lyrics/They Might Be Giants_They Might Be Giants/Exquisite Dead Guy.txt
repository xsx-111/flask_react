Exquisite Dead Guy LyricsExquisite dead guy
Rotating in his display case
Exquisite dead guy
Swear I saw his mouth move
Exquisite dead guy
Outside my high rise apartment
Exquisite dead guy
Hanging from a skyhook
How am I supposed to let you know the way I feel
About you
How am I supposed to let you know the way I feel
About youEmbed
