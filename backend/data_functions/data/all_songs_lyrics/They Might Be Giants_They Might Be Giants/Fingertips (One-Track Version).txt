Fingertips (One-Track Version) Lyrics“Everything is catching
Yes, everything is catching on fire
(Everything’s catching on fire)
Everything is catching on fire (everything’s catching on fire)
Fingertips
Fingertips
Fingertips
I hear the wind blow
I hear the wind blow
It seems to say, “Hello, Hello
I’m the one who loves you so.”
Hey now everybody now
Hey now everybody
Hey now everybody now
Who’s that standing out my window?
I found a new friend
Underneath my pillow
Come on and wreck my car (come on)
Come on and wreck my car (come on)
Come on and wreck my car (come on)
Come on and wreck my car (come on)
Aren’t you the guy who hit me in the eye?
Aren’t you the guy who hit me in the eye?
Please pass the milk, please
Please pass the milk, please
Please pass the milk, please
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Who’s knocking on the wall?
All alone all alone
All by myself
What’s that blue thing doing here?
Something grabbed ahold of my hand
I didn’t know what had my hand
But that’s when all my troubles began
I don’t understand you (I don’t understand you)
I just don’t understand you (I don’t understand you)
I don’t understand the things you say
I can’t understand a single word
I don’t understand you (I don’t understand you)
I just don’t understand you (I don’t understand you)
I cannot understand you (I don’t understand you)
I don’t understand you (I don’t understand you)
I heard a sound, I turned around
I turned around to find the thing that made the sound
Mysterious whisper
Mysterious whisper
Mysterious whisper
Mysterious whisper
The day that love came to play
I’m having a heart attack
I’m having a heart attack
I’m having a heart attack
I’m having a heart attack
Fingertips
Fingertips
I walk along darkened corridors
And I walk along darkened corridors
I walk along darkened corridors
And I walk along darkened corridors1Embed
