Cowtown Lyrics
I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean
That's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea

The yellow Roosevelt Avenue leaf overturned
The ardor of arboreality is an adventure
We have spurned, we've spurned
A new leaf overturned
Is a new leaf overturned

And so I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean
And that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea

We yearn to swim for home
But our only home is bone
How sleepless is the egg
Knowing that which throws the stone
Foresees the bone, the bone
Our only home is bone
Our only home is bone
And so I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean
And that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
Yes I'm going down to Cowtown
The cow's a friend to me
Lives beneath the ocean
And that's where I will be
Beneath the waves, the waves
And that's where I will be
I'm gonna see the cow beneath the sea
Yes, I'm gonna see (I'm gonna see)
The cow (the cow)
Beneath the sea2Embed
