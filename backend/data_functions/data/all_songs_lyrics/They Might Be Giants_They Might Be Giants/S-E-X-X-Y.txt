S-E-X-X-Y Lyrics
Dressed only in clothes
From her head to her toes
This is the way
The talking part goes

S-E-X-X-Y
More than enough
Around the clock
With nobody else
S-E-X-X-Y

There she is
Standing on the bed
Cookie in one hand
Wig on her head
S-E-X-X-Y

X because it's extra, baby
Y because it's extra, baby
Unnoticed by few
Very, very few
And that includes you
Look inside your mind
Look inside your eye
Secret agent spy
Come to see why
S-E-X-X-Y

One fingernail
Across your back
Baby's first gold tooth
Initials inscribed
S-E-X-X-Y

X because it's extra, baby
Y because it's extra, baby
You gotta understand
She wants to be your man
She's got another planEmbed
