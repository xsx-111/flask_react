Robot Parade (Adult Version) LyricsHello, children
In a future time
Children will work together
To build a giant cyborg
Robot Parade
Robot Parade
Wave the flag that the robot made
Robot Parade
Robot Parade
Robots obey what the children say
Robot Parade
Robot Parade
Wave the flag that the robot made
Robot Parade
Robot Parade
Robots obey what the children sayEmbed
