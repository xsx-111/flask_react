Miles Davis & the Cool LyricsLike Miles Davis, I've been swayed by the cool
There's just something 'bout the summertime, there's just something 'bout the moon
So I laid a kiss on a stone, tossed it upside your window by the roof
Before you change your mind, Miles, bring in the cool
Honey, put on your red dress and your diamond-soled shoes
Climb on down from that window, climb on out of your room
Cause I never had a good thing and I always had the blues
But I heard that you always kinda wondered, Miles, strike up the cool
Don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
And the night is our own
Don't wait too long
Like poor Mr. Pitiful, I can't turn you loose
You move like a dream I had, I woke up sweating in my room
But your mama's got plans and your daddy's aim is true
She never understood that it ain't no good, papa never heard the cool
So now I've got up my nerve and found me a stone
With a flick of the wrist and a turn of the key, you'll just fall in my arms
And don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
And the night is our own
Don't wait too long
So why don't you sing to me on this long drive home
And let the sound of your voice sway sweet and slow
As we go down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground
We might always be blue
Jackson
So, don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
No, don't wait too long to come home
My, how the years and our youth pass on
Don't wait too long to come home
I will leave the front light on
As we go down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down from our youth to the ground
Down, down, down, down, downEmbed
