Even Cowgirls Get the Blues LyricsI haven't seen Sandy, Angry Johnny or Mary
I heard they got married and might have had a couple babies
And traded their memories for Fairview and Acres
And never play no pinball or get out past the breakers
But not me, pretty baby
I still love Tom Petty songs and drivin' old men crazy
And not while Little Eden is waitin'
So you sing me a slow song and I'll drive you crazy tonight
But all I want is you to be all right and satisfied
Brothers and sisters, know that any time or late at night
If you call, I will answer, I'm open ears though tired eyes
When the world closed its arms on us now
Can I get a witness, pretty baby?
I still love Tom Petty songs and drivin' old men crazy
And not while Little Eden is waitin'
So you sing me a slow song and I'll drive you crazy tonight
All right, all right
All right, all right
All night, all night
There's a party tonight
I say it's all right
Tell your papa you'll be home
When the good feeling dies
But not me, pretty baby
I still love Tom Petty songs and drivin' old men crazy
And not while Little Eden is waitin'
So you sing me a slow song, darlin' I'll drive you crazy tonight
All right, all right
All right, all right
Tonight, tonight
And I'll drive you crazy tonightEmbed
