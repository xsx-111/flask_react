The Patient Ferris Wheel LyricsNot tonight, not tonight
Honey I, am on fire
I can't feel a single thing but the weight of the wires
Crackin' electric light
Remember baby, we were a stone
And we would sleep where we're fallin'
We would fight about it (fight about it)
We'd fight about it (fight about it)
Then we laughed about it (laughed about it)
And we'd ride on, ride on
Ferris wheel lights on
I've never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance
I've never felt so strange
Standin' in the poundin' rain
Thinkin' about what my mother once said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance
Not tonight, not tonight
Honey I, am on fire
If we don't come through, they're gonna bury us alive
In this great abyss
Of just what might have been
Where we can take a seat at the bar with the other broken heroes
Where they talk about it (talk about it)
Just talk about it (talk about it)
And do nothin' 'bout it (nothin' 'bout it)
Right on, right on
Ferris wheel lights on
I've never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance
I've never felt so strange
Standin' in the poundin' rain
Thinkin' about what my mother once said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance
I've never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what Wagin' Matty said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance
Maybe I should call me an ambulance
I've never felt so strange
Standin' in the Jersey rain
Thinkin' about what an old man said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance
I've never felt so strange
Standin' in the poundin' rain
Thinkin' about what my mama always said
Maybe I should call me an ambulance

Boardwalk talks
In the dead of night
Always made you smile
Always made you smile
Always made you smile2Embed
