Casanova, Baby! LyricsDo you hear that whistle wail?
Think the end is coming in?
But I'm a whole lot worse than well
But I'm determined to slip this skin
And I know you're dying for a good time
Dying to breathe again
Oh my my, Virginia
We could run all night
And dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand
I'll give the very best I can
Boy, I still wanna be your man
I'm still these nervous feet
And heart of stone
Forget this dead mans town
I'll take you home
Do you hear me late at night?
Always picking at the pieces
Sometimes nothing comes out right
And nothing is relieving
But every soul man's song
Is a night I'd like to spend with you
Just twisting the night away
But it's past a quarter to three
And it's past the midnight hour
Mustang Sally's left the building
And we're so much worse without her
If I could put down this ol' hammer
I'd take you somewhere new
Oh my my, Virginia
We could run all night
And dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand
I'll give the very best I can
Boy, I still wanna be your man
I'm still these nervous feet
And heart of stone
Forget this dead mans town
I'll take you home
Oh my my, Virginia
We could run all night
And dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand
I'll give the very best I can
And we could run all night
And dance upon the architecture
Come and take my hand
I'll give the very best I can
Boy, I still wanna be your man
I'm still these nervous feet
And heart of stone
Forget this dead mans town
I'll take you homeEmbed
