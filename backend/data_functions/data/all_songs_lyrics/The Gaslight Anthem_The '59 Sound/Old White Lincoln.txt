Old White Lincoln Lyrics"Out of the car, longhair!"

If I could write, I'd tell you how much I've missed these nights
Where we'd dig around the bones
And try to find peace and patches for the holes
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
The corner boys told her how I was dyin' to meet her
Like a prayer I said on a dead man's knee
You drove up like a parade

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart
You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart straight in my arms
Fell straight in my arms

And I miss it sometimes
Shakin' like a leaf on the corner of Vine
But I heard it's alright
The radio spoke to a good friend of mine
And I can feel it comin' up as the night's gettin' warm
I saw your summer dress hangin' on the back of the lawn
Like a dream I remember from an easier time
With the top rolled down on a Saturday night
You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart
You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart right in my arms
Right in my arms

And I always dreamed of classic cars and movie screens
And tryin' to find some way to be redeemed
Bring a dollar with you, baby
In the cold, cold ground

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart
You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart
You fell straight in my arms
You fell straight in my armsEmbed
