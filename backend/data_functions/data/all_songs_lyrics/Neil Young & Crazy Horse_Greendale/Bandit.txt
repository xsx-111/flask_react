Bandit Lyrics
Turning the pages
In this old book
Seems familiar
Might be worth a second look
Wrapping up dope in a paper bag
Talking to yourself
Taking a drag
Who are you kidding
With what you say?
What does it matter?
They'll never hear it anyway
Got to get past
The negative thing
The lawyers and business
You get what you bring
No one's sorry
You did it yourself
It's time to relax now
And then give it hell

Someday you'll find
What you're looking for
Someday you'll find
What you're looking for
You didn't bet on the Dodgers
To beat the Giants
Then David came up
Now you gotta pay up
You didn't count on that
Geez half the money's gone
The month is still young
Where you gonna go now?
Things are closing in
Got to trust someone
Trust someone
Someone you trust
Got to be careful
Be careful

You can't go to your brother
That money's all gone
Can't go to your friends

Someday
You'll find
Everything you're looking for
Made out like a bandit
For so many years
What are you working for?
One more big score?
What are you trying to prove?
Try to get closer
But not too close
Try to get through
But not be through
No one can touch you now
But I can touch you now
You're invisible
You got too many secrets
Bob Dylan said that
Something like that

Someday
You'll find
Everything you're looking forEmbed
