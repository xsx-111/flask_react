Double E Lyrics
Back in the country
Living on the Double E
In the sunshine of her life
There's a ready young filly
And mom and daddy
Won't let her leave
Mom and papa won't let her go
But when they go out dancing
She breaks out on her own
She's hot enough to
Burn the house down
And mom and daddy don't know
When Edith and Earl
Renamed the Double E
They nearly made history
The neighbors rose up
And some of them were mad as hell
Because it used to be the Double L
Change comes slow in the country
When you're new
There's a lot of distrust
Years pass by uneventful
And memories turn to dust
Meanwhile granny
Has got her bright colors on
The sunshine in her eyes
Cruising by the bars
And honky tonks where she met grandpa
And caught that young man's eye
Dusty white Eldorado
Cruising through the trees
Slipping through the shadows
Of what used to be

Back in the day
Living in the summer of love
Living in the summer of love

Grandma's ok
But not the same since grandpa's gone
She's living in the summer of love


Living in the summer of loveEmbed
