Be the Rain Lyrics
Save the planet for another day
"attention shoppers, buy with a conscience and save"
Save the planet for another day
"save alaska! let the caribou stay"
Don't care what the governments say
"they're all bought and paid for anyway"
Save the planet for another day
"hey big oil, what do you say?"
We were running through the night
Never knowing if we would see the light
Paranoid schizophrenic visions
Living in fear of the wrong decisions

We got to wake up
We got to keep going
If they follow us
There's no way of knowing
We got a job to do
We got to
Save mother earth

Be the ocean when it meets the sky
"you can make a difference, if you really try"
Be the magic in the northern lights
"six days....six nights"
Be the river as it rolls along
"it has three eyed fish and it's smelling strong"
Be the rain you remember falling
"be the rain, be the rain"
Yeah rain was falling and we're soaking wet
Hail is beating down on our heads
The wind is blowing through our hair
Faces frozen in the frigid air
We got to get there
Alaska
We got to be there
Before the big machines
We got a job to do
We got to
Save mother earth

Dream the hunter on the western plain
"the birds are all gone, where did they go?"
Dream the fisherman in his boat
"he's coming home empty, he's barely afloat"
Dream the logger in the great northwest
"they're running out of trees, they got to give it a rest"
(there's no other way to cut it)
Dream the farmer in the old heartland
"corporate greed and chemicals are killing the land"
Next morning sun was up at dawn
She looked around and earth was gone
Dark visions he had last night
He needed peace, he needed light

He heard the rumble and
He saw the big machines
The green army rose
It was a bad dream
He had a job to do
He had to
Save mother earth
Be the ocean when it meets the sky
"greek freighters are dumping crap somewhere right now"
Be the magic in the northern lights
"the ice is melting!"
Be the river as it rolls along
"toxic waste dumping from corporate farms"
Be the rain you remember falling
"be the rain, be the rain"
Save the planet for another day
"be the rain, be the rain"
Be the river as it rolls along
"be the rain, be the rain"Embed
