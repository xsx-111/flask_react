Leave the Driving Lyrics
Out on the old coast highway
Flying through the night
Jed got stopped by the CHP
For speeding and no brake lights
Rolled down the drivers window
Slipped his gun down under the seat
Glove box full of cocaine
Trunk was full of weed
Driver's license and registration
Said the officer with his flashlight
Searching around the floor of the car
Smelling like something ain't right
Jed's life flashed before him
Like a black and white super 8
He heard the sound of the future
On a scratchy old 78
Nothing was still, all was moving
When the flashlight found the gun
Then jed pulled the trigger
In a split second tragic blunder
Makes you think about living
And what life has to tell
Said jed to grandpa
From inside his cell
Camouflage hung in his closet
Guns all over the wall
Plans for buildings and engineers
And a book with no numbers at all
The whole town was stunned
They closed the coast highway for 12 hours
No one could believe it
Jed was one of ours
Meanwhile across the ocean
Living in the internet
Is the cause of an explosion
No one has heard yet
But there's no need to worry
There's no reason to fuss
Just go on about your work now
And leave the driving to us
And we'll be watching you
No matter what you do
And you can do your part
By watching others too
Grandpa put down the paper
Staring in disbelief
Jed had always been good to him
And never gave him any grief
"the moral of this story
Is try not to get too old
The more time you spend on earth
The more you see unfold
And as an afterthought
This must to be told
Some people have taken pure bullshit
And turned it into goldEmbed
