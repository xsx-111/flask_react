Teacher of Love LyricsI'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the teacher of love
(Teacher, won't you teach me tonight?)
I'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the preacher of love
(Teacher, won't you teach me tonight?)
Come to my class tonight
Don't be late or you'll be left behind
'Cause I'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the teacher of love
Yes, I'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the teacher of love
(Teacher, won't you teach me tonight?)
Yes, I'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the preacher of love
(Teacher, won't you teach me tonight?)
I said come to me to learn what love's about
I don't want to see you be a love dropout
'Cause I'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the teacher of love
Yes, I'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the teacher of love
(Teacher, won't you teach me tonight?)
I said I'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the preacher of love
(Teacher, won't you teach me tonight?)
I said come to me to learn what love's about
I don't want to see you be a love dropout
'Cause I'm the lovin' lovin' man
I'm the teacher of loveEmbed
