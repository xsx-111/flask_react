A Deeper Shade of Soul Lyrics
A deeper shade of soul, yeah yeah
A deeper shade of soul
A deeper shade of soul, yeah yeah
A deeper shade of soul

She don't want my money (What I say?)
And no Cadillac (What I say?)
She just wants my lovin' (What I say?)
And to love me back (Alright!)

She's got soul!
(That's my baby!)
She's got soul!

A deeper shade of soul, yeah yeah
A deeper shade of soul
A deeper shade of soul, yeah yeah
A deeper shade of soul

She'll drink wine in Paris (What I say?)
Sake in Japan (What I say?)
But when it comes to lovin' (What I say?)
Oh, I'm her lover man (Alright!)
She's got soul!
(That's my baby!)
She's got soul!


A deeper shade of soul, what she's got
A deeper shade of soul
(I'm tryin' to tell you about my baby)
A deeper shade of soul, what she's got
A deeper shade of soul
(Yeeeaah, my baby)
A deeper shade of soul, what she's got
A deeper shade of soul


A deeper shade of soul, what she's got
A deep shade of soul
(Yeeeaah, my baby)
A deeper shade of soul, what she's got
(Come out and see my baby)
A deeper shade of soul
(Yeah, my baby's got soul now)
A deeper shade of soul, what she's got
(Yeah, yeah, my baby, my baby)
A deeper shade of soul
(Yeah baby, oh baby)
A deeper shade of soul, what she's got
(Yeah, that's my honey, yeah)
A deeper shade of soulEmbed
