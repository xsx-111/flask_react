Tar-Heel Boy LyricsTar-heel boy sings a song
Bout a girl who ain't comin' home
By n by, by n by
By n by, by n by
She worked too long in the mill
She's gone to those rolling hills in the sky
We're barely off Mama's milk
And we're locked in here weavin' silk
We can't buy, we can't buy
While you been off in Oregon
I been drinkin' here all alone
All night long, all day long
They shot a nine-year-old boy
For a hundred dollarsEmbed
