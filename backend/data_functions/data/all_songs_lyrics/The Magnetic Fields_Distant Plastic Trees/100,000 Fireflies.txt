100,000 Fireflies LyricsI have a mandolin
I play it all night long
It makes me want to kill myself
I also have a Dobro
Made in some mountain range
Sounds like a mountain range in love
But when I turn up the tone
On my electric guitar
I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me
I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me
I went out to the forest and caught
100,000 fireflies
As they ricochet round the room
They remind me of your starry eyes
Someone else's might not have made me so sad
But this is the worst night I ever had
'Cause I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me
I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me
Always was
You won't be happy with me
But give me one more chance
You won't be happy anyway
Why do we still live here
In this repulsive town?
All our friends are in New York
Why do we keep shrieking
When we mean soft things?
We should be whispering all the timeEmbed
