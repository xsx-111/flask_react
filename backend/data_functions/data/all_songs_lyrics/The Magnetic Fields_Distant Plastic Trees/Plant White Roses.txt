Plant White Roses LyricsWhen I poured my heart out, blood flowed
I planted you, watered you with tears
And watched you grow away from me
So much for my green thumb
I've overstayed my welcome
Plant white roses and plan to cry
If I can't spend my life with you
Plant white roses, I wanna die
If I can't spend my life with you
When you're gone I stumble and fall
I'm told you don't wanna stay around
Those trains call, you're all I need
But you need more than country songs
You need to be getting along
Plant white roses and plan to cry
If I can't spend my life with you
Plant white roses, I wanna die
If I can't spend my life with you
You'll have to stay
You'll have to stay and watch them grow
You'll have to stay
You'll have to stay and watch them grow
You'll have to stay
You'll have to stay and watch them grow
Plant white roses and plan to cry
If I can't spend my life with you
Plant white roses, I wanna die
If I can't spend my life with you
My life with you
My life with youEmbed
