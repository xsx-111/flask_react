Miss Misery (Early Version) LyricsI'll fake it through the day
With some help from Johnny Walker Red
And the cold pain behind my eyes
That shoots back through my head
With two tickets torn in half and a lot nothing to do
But it's alright cause some enchanted night I'll be with you
Tarot cards and the lines in my hand
Tell me I'm wrong
But they're untrue
I got plans for both of us that involve a trip out of town
To a place I've seen in a magazine that you left lying around
I can't hold my liquor but I keep a good attitude
Cause it's alright some enchanted night I'll be with you
And though you'd rather see me gone
Than to see there come the day
I'll be waiting for you anyway
Next door the TV's flashing blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy from the seventies with a lead no one recalls
He vanished into oblivion
It's easy to do
And I cried a sea when you talked to me
The day you said we were through
But it's alright, some enchanted night I'll be with you1Embed
