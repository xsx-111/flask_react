All Cleaned Out LyricsHere come your pride and joy
The comic little drunk you call your boy
Making everybody smile
Who takes your pretty plan
And then becomes a disappearing man
After a little while
I saw you with your makeup running down
Now what's that all about?
You say you don't want anyone around
Cause you're all cleaned out
You toss the empty beer
Not really as composed as you appear
An icicle inside
Wearing clothes that clash
Wondering is this treasure, is this trash
Still trying to decide
And about 5 o'clock here comes your clown
With the front he's throwing down
But all you say is you don't want anyone around
No, not right now
There ain't nothing to drink
You don't want to think about it
I'm sorry you seem so stung
And I'm sorry you think you have to hold your tongue
When you're so pretty and smart
I'm seeing you caving in
Becoming afraid of all these men
That you've given your heart
I saw you with your makeup running down
Now what's that all about?
You say you don't want anyone around
Cause you're all cleaned out
All cleaned out
All cleaned outEmbed
