Either/Or LyricsYou're strong, you're stubborn now
In an endless symbolic war
Brave or bored
Either/or
Sometimes I ricochet from the past
And at times, a future I've already had before
Champion or chore
Either/or
I'll write the pages you rip out
Back in their places again
One day you'll know what you're talking about
I can hardly imagine
But until then I'll be
Filling in these blanks that you create
Every time you win some petty score
Posing as hardcore, oh yeah
Either/or
Look at the spin chief
Battered and broken
Clutching a plastic rose
We're all in the downpour you carry around for
Trashing a lifestyle you've never known
It's a useful dream that makes
Quite an entertaining show
And not much more
Up against and for
