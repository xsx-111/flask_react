Fear City LyricsDragged down into lowercase
Trying to get your cops to talk right
â€˜Cause they can't put the paper to your face
When you're just trying to walk by
So now I got a new game, baby
No one's gonna recognize it
Your broken English over their flat, tired rhymes
Still trying to bring some dead beauty back to life
Isn't it pretty?
Yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead
I can do everything that your man does except for better
Got no interest now in addressing you kids
With cheap angst love letters
You write your name in all of the places no one goes
Some can't be satisfied until everybody knows
Isn't it pretty?
Yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead
Isn't it pretty?
Yeah
I'm gonna see my city dead (come on)
Isn't it pretty?
Yeah
I'm gonna see my city deadEmbed
