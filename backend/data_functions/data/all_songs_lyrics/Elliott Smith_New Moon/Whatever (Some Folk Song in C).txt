Whatever (Some Folk Song in C) LyricsThey come here alone and they leave in twos
Except for you and me who just came to use
If you're all done like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
Why you tell me stuff that's so plainly untrue?
If you'll be straight with me, I'll be straighter with you
If you're all done, like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
I haven't wanted to do anything for a long time
But whatever you got right now will probably suit me fine
If you're all done, like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
I haven't wanted to do anything for a long time
Whatever you're doing now would probably suit me fine
If you're all done, like you said you'd be
What are you doing hanging out with me?
What are you doing hanging out with me?1Embed
