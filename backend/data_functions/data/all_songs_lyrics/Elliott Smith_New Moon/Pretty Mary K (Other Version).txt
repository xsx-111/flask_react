Pretty Mary K (Other Version) LyricsPretty Mary K walks along the dock
With some sailor's pay shoved down in her sock
Pretty Mary K with some little boy in blue
Who can't stay away from you
Pretty Mary K took him back to town
I'm down here by the bay where the water pounds
Up against the wall crying black and blue
He keeps me away from you
Pretty words that you whispered
Maybe I misunderstood
Somebody's not paying attention
What they promise and their word isn't good
Oh, Mary K, I can see your face
Down there in the waves, painted and erased
But I know it's just a reflection of the moon
A big fake resembling you
I'm gonna go down in the water
Fill my mouth up full of sand
I'll be waiting, still impatient with my dead imagination
While you're with some other man
Pretty Mary K is off in somebody's room
I'm down here by the bay, my arm around the moon
But I'll be with you soon, just as soon as I've paid
A walk across the water with pretty Mary K
Walk on water, pretty Mary KEmbed
