Placeholder LyricsLooking at all the rows
All these records look like big zeroes
Got your picture on the back of a 45
A placeholder till you take up mine
A placeholder till you take up mine
I'm the person you'll never need
The biggest loser on 16th Street
The invisible man with the see-through mind
A placeholder till you take up mine
A placeholder till you take up mine
Break off up in someone's loft
In midtown 'round there next to the square
He likes the way that you look now
Like an open book
Just like my favorite song
Some pretty words that didn't last that long
Like a package sent priority overnight
Placeholder, come and take up mine
Placeholder, come and take up mine
Placeholder, come and take up mine
Placeholder, come and take up mineEmbed
