Talking to Mary LyricsTalking to Mary
You know you don't have to shout
She can hear what you're thinking
Like you were saying it right out loud
It's you she sees behind
That dirty look
It was her that followed down
Every stupid turn that you took
One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so
Saw the one big problem
You keep under your hat
And it's pretty unlikely
That anybody else will be cool with that
You got bus fare in your pocket
And more money down in your sock
But she can't tell you how to contact her
If you won't listen to her talk
One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so
It's no problem, I'll just keep quiet
If it's easier for you
To make believe then
That I don't love you as much as I do
One day she'll go, I told you so
One day she'll go, I told you so
I told you so
I told you soEmbed
