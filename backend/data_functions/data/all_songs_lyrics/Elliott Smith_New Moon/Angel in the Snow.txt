Angel in the Snow LyricsI’d say you make a perfect
Angel in the snow
All crushed out on the way you are
Better stop before it goes too far
Don’t you know that I love you?
Sometimes I feel like
Only a cold still life
That fell down here to lay beside you
Don’t you know that I love you?
Sometimes I feel like
Only a cold still life
Only a frozen still life
That fell down here to lay beside you3Embed
