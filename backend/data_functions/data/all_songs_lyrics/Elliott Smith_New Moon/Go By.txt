Go By LyricsGo on and parade and fade
Hit the scene and slow
Spending all your time with some girl
You'll never get to know
Wound up tight
Dressed all in white
Some torn mainsail
Blowing out to drift
Leave you even if
You live up in your head
Scared of every little noise
Someone always breaking in accidentally
Using nothing but their voice
Shrill and small, echo down the hall
Repeating pet names
See it in your eyes, you're only passing by
Go by
Go by
Go by
Go by
Someone's in the way
Of pretty words and inside slurs
All the things they have to say
To perform the work that they've rehearsed
It's a waste of time
I'd put it behind me once and for all
And let the high decline
If the problem wasn't mine
Go by
Go by
Go by
Go by
Go by
Go by
Go by
