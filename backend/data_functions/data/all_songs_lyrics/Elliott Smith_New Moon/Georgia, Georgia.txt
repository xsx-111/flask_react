Georgia, Georgia LyricsGeorgia, Georgia
It's many, many miles
Since I seen your fallen smile
Close up and personal
Your arsenal of excuses
You never told her
When you walked out on the Savannah shoulder
With your veins all full of beer
Thinking "well, at least now everything is clear"
But oh man, what a plan
Suicide
It's just not that much different from my own affair
All ends in cussing and crying
How about if you tell me something new?
Tell me what would make you happy
Oh, you so deserve to be
There are protests and contests
Attitudes to cop
I want it all to stop
Three weeks ago, you were all grace and charm
Now I know it was just a false alarm
Georgia, Georgia
I can't understand you since
You have no forgiveness
No attention left to pay
The quiet way you leave and just forget it all
Just takes my breath away
How's that supposed to make me feel?
Yeah, well, how am I supposed to feel?1Embed
