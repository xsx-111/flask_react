Half Right LyricsWell, you shouldn't doctor yourself
Well, I pictured somebody else
Someone that looks like
What I look like
Would you say that the one of your dreams
Got in you and ripped out the seams?
That's what I'd say
That's what I'd say
He was a sucker for your double-dose
Motherfucker turned white as a ghost
Don't you say hi
Don't you say hi
With a broken sink for a face
And a head that just takes up space
He's not half right
He's not half right
It's already half past
And it won't last
I was sticking up for my friend
When there's nothing much to defend
It's a lost fight
It's a lost fight
Cause when I talk to you on the phone
Well, it's just like being alone
It's not half right
It's not half right1Embed
