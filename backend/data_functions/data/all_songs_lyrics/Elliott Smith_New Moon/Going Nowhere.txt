Going Nowhere Lyrics
He waved hello, silent like a mime
Meaning "There's no changing my mind"
I won't walk the stairs with you tonight
Going nowhere
The clock moved a quarter of a turn
The time it took her cigarette to burn
She said, "You got a lot of things to learn"
Going nowhere

I saw you move a certain way
I missed you a lot
Return to this abandoned place
Should've been forgot

Echoes drown the conversation out
Echoes that only seem to bring about
A silent expression, easy read aloud
Going nowhere
The steps made a pattern I'd never seen
I felt like a kid of six or seventeen
I was off in some empty daydream
Going nowhere
It's dead and gone and matter of fact
It may be for the best
You said some things you can't take back
Honestly, I guess

The old records are sitting on the floor
The ones I can't put on anymore
He walked over to her like before

Going nowhere
Going nowhere
