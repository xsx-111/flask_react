Seen How Things are Hard LyricsThe tin kids who betrayed
The stupid shit you just played
I took pictures in my head
You and a blank stare, we had a little trace of you there
You just didn't care
You were off getting drunk instead
I’ve seen how things are hard
I’ve seen how things are hard
I love you though
I’ve seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well, don't you know?
You were scared of what you thought
With a dizzy high
You freaked out and forgot
You stayed well away from trouble that you caused
Using all your strength
To keep the world at an arm's length and not get upset
At this self-imposed loss
I’ve seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well, don't you know?
I'm a cracked reflection of you
I can't make corrections for you
You have to help me patch things up
Seen how things are hard
I’ve seen how things are hard
I love you though
Seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well, don't you know?
I’ve seen how things are hard
I’ve seen how things are hard
I love you though
I’ve seen how things are hard
Seen how things are hard
Well, don't you know?
