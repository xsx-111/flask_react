High Times LyricsComa kid
Coma kid
Tell me how
You come to follow you around
Wherever you go
Said I don't go where I'm supposed go
And I don't go really anywhere, you know
Told me how he's driven by a curse
'Til he kicked out into reverse
Said I don't go where I'm supposed to go
And I don't go really anywhere, you know
I made up my mind, and I don't mind sayinâ€™ so
I went to meet you at central square
And when I couldn't find you there
I went walking around the city some more
People watching with a cold blank stare
And I saw your face in everyone, I swear
Seems I never get your kick quite right
I was walking slow to a dirty dive
I'm so sick and tired of trying to change your mind
When it's so easy to disconnect mine
High times
High times
High times
Yeah, I feel fine
High times
High times
High times
Man, I feel fine
Don't pick me up
I'm fine right where I am
I don't go where I'm supposed go
Where I'm supposed to go5Embed
