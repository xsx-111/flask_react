See You Later LyricsI got a choke chain
Made out of Night Train
To keep your memory down
In quicksand from the main man
To drown everything out
We were out on a joyride
Fucked up from insides
Always at a dead stall
From sticking pins in a miniature man
Who can't feel it at all
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you later
Walk through thick mud
Looking for new blood
Thinking I heard your name
Cruel imagination still giving me pain
Just to find you with your masterminder
Running your affairs
Saying how you're better now
Since it killed all your other cares
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you later
See you later
If I see you at all
See you laterEmbed
