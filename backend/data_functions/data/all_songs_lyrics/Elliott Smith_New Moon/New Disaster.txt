New Disaster LyricsThe ghost of your smile is always looking
For new bodies to haunt
And its been here and disappeared
It's hanging around aloofly for a while
Gradually gone
It's pleasing and freezing
Well, I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
You looked all over town
Got turned around
To walk back through the mud
The kind you had left behind you
Everybody is the same in this long no-win game
Where every new blood
Gets time to become resigned
Now I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never tried to tame your master
You just blow through the coals
Blow through the coals
Blow through the coals
Until everyone knows that your smile is just a ghost
The ghost of your smile was seen on a body in the park
It's old news
You see that it's no use
Waiting to start
Waiting to light
Waiting until dark
I told you, man
I told you
Well, I wonder what it is you're after
Keeping company with this disaster
Why you never tried to tame your master4Embed
