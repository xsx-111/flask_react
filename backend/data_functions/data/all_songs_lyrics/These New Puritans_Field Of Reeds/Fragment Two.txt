Fragment Two LyricsIn between the reed nodes, where the stars are hiding
In the way that an animal wakes
There is something there
In amongst the gaps falls every word and silence
In crushed glass by the trainline
There is something there
Something is there
In between the islands where we used to swim
To that place I am on my way
I am on my way
(Something is there)
I swam towards your ship
Like a missile guided by vague feelings
I swam, I swam
I will swim, I will swim
I will swim towards your ship
