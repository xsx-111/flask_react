Dream LyricsThese are all words lost in dreams
Travelling the speed that blood pumps
I feel your breath which carries my hope
In the way ships pass at night
Making the hands a world map
Every word announces storms
It’s like stepping from the door
There is no barrier and no wall
In the way ships pass at night
Endless looping chains of rooms
Go forever, hurry you’re…

Looping streetlights spell out words
I don’t want to say goodbye
But as I wake it begins to lose senseEmbed
