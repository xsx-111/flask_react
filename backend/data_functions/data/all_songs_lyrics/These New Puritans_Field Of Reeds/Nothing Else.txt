Nothing Else LyricsPath through clouds
But tied in knots (to hide the light inside)
Is there a prayer that just for a moment
Real life and dreaming swap places?
Nothing else but this
Drift like feathers down beneath the rolling waves
A prayer that just for a minute
Nonsense and meaning swap places
Nothing else but thisEmbed
