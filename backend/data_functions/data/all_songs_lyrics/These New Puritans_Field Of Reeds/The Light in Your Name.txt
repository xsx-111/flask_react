The Light in Your Name LyricsThe door was open
I walked in la-da-la-da
Your clothes without you in them
Your name without you with it
I am your last, I am your least
I walked in la-da-la-da
I was a grain of sand, you were the still black sea
And though they growl and spit
Don't let them pull you away
And though the waves will spin
Don't let them
Can't you see it moving like ghosts dancing
All the light in your name
Pick a colour I'll fade into
Is dreaming further or closer?
I will be waiting
This the colour I'll fade into
I want a light that's blinding
I will be waiting
When I row out the air and sea become one thing
Until I reach the mouth
And though the waves will hit
Don't let them pull you away
Can't you see it moving like ghosts dancing
All the light in your name
Pick a colour I'll fade into
Is dreaming further or closer?
I will be waiting
You had me pasted over
I'll hold you nearer still
You have led me out here
I can't lead you back again
(I have led you out here
I can't lead you back again)Embed
