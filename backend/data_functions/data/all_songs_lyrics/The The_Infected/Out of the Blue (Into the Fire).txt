Out of the Blue (Into the Fire) LyricsI'm a man without a soul...Honey, yeah
I lost it while parading it, in a town full of thieves
Y'see I didn't wanna be with any people I know
But god knows, I didn't wanna be alone
I thought if I acted like someone else
I'd feel more comfortable with myself
So I showered down, left my little room
Jumped in my car for protection from hostility
Well it ain't easy to be bold in an unknown city
Yeah I was feeling strong mouthed and weak willed
When I ran into the cure for my ills
Don't tell me what your name is
I want your body, not your mind
I want a feeling, worth paying for before I say goodbye
But as I was talking, I couldn't look her in the eyes
I just kept wondering
How many men unleashed their frustration between her thighs?
There'll be no sleep 'til the morning
There'll be no lullabyes
'cause the devil borrowed my clothes just for tonight
Well my adrenalin, was curdling like cream
As I was being led by the hand
Through the sound of sirens
And the distant noise of some drunken jazz band
Through the stench of disinfectant--
That "INFECTED" my head
Through the darkness of a corridor
And into a stranger's bed
Well I didn't wanna hurt your feelings, honey
But I couldn't suppress my own
I had to pull myself outta this nosedive
By proving something to myself
She was lying on her back
With her lips parted
Squealing like a stuffed pig
I was going through the motions
Faking the emotions
And wriggling around like a lizard in a tin
Trying so hard to cleanse myself
I was turning into somebody else
I was trying so hard to please myself
I was turning into somebody else
I was trying so hard to be myself
I was turning into somebody else
I was trying so hard to be myself
I was turning into somebody else
I was trying so hard to be myself
I was turning into somebody else
Come my love with your desire
Out of the blue...and into the fire!!Embed
