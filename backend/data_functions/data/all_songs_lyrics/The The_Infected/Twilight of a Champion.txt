Twilight of a Champion LyricsThe rising moon faces the sickening sun
As the lights in the tower blocks go on, one by one
A big shot, overlooking this black iron skyline--
Surrounded by his symbols of prosperity--
Sits back in his new leather chair
Ripped off the back of some unfortunate beast
I'm smiling through my teeth
Anybody can be a millionaire
So everybody's gotta try
But by the laws of this human jungle
Only the heartless will survive
& down there--but for the grace of god
--go I
The smoke & the steam, & the broken down dreams
The hope, & the hunger, frustration & anger
The little drunken lives,--
Driven' through the traffic lights
& away from who they are!
But I've been thinking of you--
In this great city of great solitude

Crossin' the central reservation, of my imagination
Searchin' for the world I...left behind
A shadow hunting shadows of childhood life
It's all I want--& all I miss--
But how can I return, to a place that don't exist!!
From Mombosa to Miami, Beiruit to Bangladesh
I've flown around the world standing
On the wing of a jet
Tryin' to salvage my emotions
From the bottom of the oceans--
Y'see I sold my soul, to pay for my dinner
My stomach grew fatter, but my heart grew thinner
I ain't foolin' I'm fallin', I wasn't wicked, just weak
I ain't lyin' I'm dyin', crippled by deceit--

Crossin' the central reservation, of my imagination
Searchin' for the world I...left behind
A shadow hunting shadows of childhood life
It's all I want--& all I miss--
But how can I return, to a place that don't exist!!
Oh the hand that wrote the agony
Has just begun--
Will be the hand that pulls the trigger
--of this gun!!!Embed
