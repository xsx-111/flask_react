Sweet Bird of Truth Lyrics"Red Leader this is Combat, your forward air controller. I have three targets for you. Your first target is a blockhouse. Target number eleven at the North East corner of the combat zone. Request napalm."
"Roger. White Leader, set up your switches. Set your napalm on the blockhouse, North East corner of the target area."
"White Leader understands. Thirty seconds."
"White Flag, this is Bandit. I have you in sight, roll in to the west. Call to confirm you have target in sight"

6 o'clock in the morning and I'm the last person in this plane still awake
Y'know I can almost smell the blood washing against the shores
Of this land that can't forget its past
Oh, the wind that carries this plane is the wind of change
Heaven sent, and hell bent
Over the mountain tops we go, just like all the other G.I. Joes
E-I-E-I, adios
This is your captain calling (with an urgent warning)
We're above the Gulf of Arabia (our altitude is falling)
And I can't hold her up (there's no time for thinking)
All hands on deck (this bird is sinking)
Across the beaches and cranes, rivers and trains
All the money I've made, bodies I've maimed
Time was when I seemed to know
Just like any other G.I. Joe
Should I cry like a baby, or die like a man
While the planet's little wars start joining hands
Oh, what a heaven, what a hell
Y'know there's nothing can be done in this whole wide world
Arabia
I don't know what's wrong or right
I'm just a regular guy with bottled up insides
I ain't ever been to church or believed in Jesus Christ
But I'm praying that God's with you when you die
This is your captain calling (with an urgent warning)
We're above the Gulf of Arabia (our altitude is falling)
And I can't hold her up (there's no time for thinking)
All hands on deck (this bird is sinking)
