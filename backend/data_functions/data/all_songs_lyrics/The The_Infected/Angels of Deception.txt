Angels of Deception LyricsWell it's high noon at the U.K. corral
And it's high time I got myself back on the rails
I'm the lonesome cowboy, ridin across the range
With just a hand held radio--to keep me sane
Ridin through the f.m. stations, the tumbleweed
And the petrol stations
Will all on board this Yankee station
Prepare themselves for battle stations--
CHORUS
Jesus Wept. Jesus CHRIST
I can't see for the tear gas, and the dollar signs in my eyes
Well, what's a man got left to fight for
When he's bought his freedom
By the look of this human jungle
It ain't just the poor who'll be bleeding!
Most everyone round here thinks they're something special
That destiny will be kind--
While they're digging for gold, diving for pearls
And aiming for heaven from this man made world
Come on down--the devil's in town
He's brought you sticks and stones
To bust your neighbors bones
He's stuck his missiles in your gardens
And his theories down your throat--
And god knows what your gonna do with him
Cos I certainly don't
CHORUS
Down by the river, I've been washing out my mouth
Cos deep in the heart of me
There's a frightened man breaking out
Oh I was just looking for paradise
Anywhere in this world
While they're gunning for heaven--
From this man made hell!!!
God knows because they don't
Come on down, the Devil's in town
Angels, angels of Destruction
Angels, angels of Destruction
Angels, angels of Destruction
Angels, angels of Destruction
Angels, angels of Destruction
Angels, angels of DeceptionEmbed
