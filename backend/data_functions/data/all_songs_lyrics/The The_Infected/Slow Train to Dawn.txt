Slow Train to Dawn LyricsI followed that bead of sweat
To the small of your back
From the nape of your neck
Lightin' it up, with every drag upon my cigarette
It can run, but it can't hide--
Like the unspoken feelings on your mind
I'm too tense to be tender
Your too weak to be true
You try to make it easier upon yourself
By makin' it hard on you!
But it's the lies in your eyes
That make me wanna cry--
It's just sometimes I get so lonesome
--I could die

I'm just another western guy
With desires that I can't satisfy
So all the love I gave to you
Means nothing at all
Dear God, God, God, this slow train to dawn
So are you lying when you say you love me
I'm lying when I say I don't--
We've opened our hearts to let each other look in
To have and to hold
But it's the words that remain unsaid
That are the words I wanna hear you speak
I bet the birds start singing, & the sun comes up
Before we fall asleep--
Oh the tears in your eyes, just make me wanna cry
It's just sometimes I get so lonesome--I Could Die!!

I'm just another western guy
With desires that I can't satisfy
So all the love I gave to you
Means nothing at all
Dear God, God, God, this slow train to dawnEmbed
