Slither Lyrics
Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?

Ohh, watch the puppets dancing
Yeah, see the clowns fall down
Hey, tie your tap shoes tightly
Yeah, and wear them into town

See you crawling
See you crawling in

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
There ain't no heroes here no more

Hey hey hey
Ooh, play the game so nicely
Oh, check, its your move now
Yeah, we are standing in this jungle
Yeah, with serpents I have found
See you crawling
See you crawling in

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
Then your heroes disappeared

See you crawling
See you crawling in

Don't go looking for snakes you might find them
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them
Haven't I seen you here before?
No there ain't no heroes here no more
Haven't I seen you here before?
There ain't no heroes here, looking for snakes you might find them
Haven't I seen you before?
Then your heroes disappeared
Don't send your eyes to the sun you might blind them, yeahEmbed
