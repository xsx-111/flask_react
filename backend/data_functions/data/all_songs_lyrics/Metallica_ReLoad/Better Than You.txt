Better Than You Lyrics
I look at you, then you me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share
Holding the key
Holding me back because I'm striving to be

Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you

Lock horns, I push and I strive
Some how I feel more alive
Bury the need for it
Bury the seed
Bury me deep when there's no will to be

Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, nothing brings me down
No, can't stop this train from rolling, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, forever only no

Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, you can't take it down
No, never stop this locomotion, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, you can't bring it down because I'm

Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you
Better than you

Can't stop this train from rolling
Forever on and on and on
Forever on and on, on
Better Than You
Yeah
