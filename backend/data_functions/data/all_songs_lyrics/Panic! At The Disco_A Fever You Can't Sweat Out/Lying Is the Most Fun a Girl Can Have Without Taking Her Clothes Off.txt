Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off Lyrics
Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing
As your fingers touch his skin

I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat?
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

Let's get these teen hearts beating—faster, faster!

So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So, I guess we're back to us
Oh, cameraman, swing the focus!
In case I lost my train of thought
Where was it that we last left off?
(Let's pick up, pick up)
Oh, now I do recall
We were just getting to the part
Where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention
Now, let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

Let's get these teen hearts beating—faster, faster!

So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

Dance to this beat, dance to this beat
Dance to this beat
Let's get these teen hearts beating—faster, faster
Let's get these teen hearts beating—faster
I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat?
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

Let's get these teen hearts beating—faster, faster!

So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Dance to this beat
So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Dance to this beat
And hold a lover close

Let's get these teen hearts beating—faster, faster
Let's get these teen hearts beating—faster
