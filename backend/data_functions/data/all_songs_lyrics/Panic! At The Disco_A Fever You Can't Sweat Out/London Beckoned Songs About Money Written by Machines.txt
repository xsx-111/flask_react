London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines Lyrics
Stop stalling, make a name for yourself
Boy, you better put that pen to paper, charm your way out
If you talk, you better walk, you better back your shit up
With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun
Start talking "a sensationalist"
Oh, he's slightly clever to just a certain extent
If you talk, you better walk, you better keep your mouth shut
With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun

Panic!, meet the press
It's time for us to take a chance
It's time for us to take a chance
Panic!, meet the press
It's time for us to take a chance
It's time for us

Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzine
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word that we wrote
Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzine
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word that we wrote
I'm burning and I'm blacking my lungs
Boy, you know it feels good with fire back on your tongue
If you talk, you better walk, you better back your shit up
With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun
Start talking "a sensationalist"
Oh, he's slightly clever to just a certain extent
Well, keep quiet, let us sing like the doves
Then decide if it's done with purpose or lack thereof

Just for the record, the weather today
Is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of
A: indifference, or B: disinterest
In what the critics say

It's time for us to take a chance
It's time for us

Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzine
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word that we wrote
Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzine
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word that we wrote
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
Just for the record, the weather today
Is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
(Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh)
