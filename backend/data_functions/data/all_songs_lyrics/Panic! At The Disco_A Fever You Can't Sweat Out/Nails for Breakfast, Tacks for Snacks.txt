Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks Lyrics
Watch your mouth, oh, oh, oh
Because your speech is slurred enough
That you just might swallow your tongue

Every word gets you a step closer to hell

Alone in this bed, house, and head
And she never fixes this
But at least she
I am
Alone in this bed, ooh
She never fixes this
But at least she
