Baby I Got the Death Rattle Lyrics
We burnt all the skin from the palm of my hands
With an old Zippo lighter and deodorant can
I went to the palmist and asked her to read
No heart line, no sun line, no life line, no need
Said, "All that I wanted was a quiet life
Not one predetermined by minuscule slices
Into my flesh", and the broad, she agreed
One look in my sad eyes, she had to concede

Baby, the girdle of Venus got me
Got me down on my knees
And baby, baby, I got the death rattle
And you're six months old sh-shakin' me

Traced my right index finger 'long the roof of every car
On the walk back to your house in the cold from City Arms
In the frost, I drew a dick for every girl that wouldn't fuck me
Woke early the next morning to see the frost had bitten me
My blisters black and touch cold
Like a cute stuffed toy bear's nose
The kind of gift I'd give you, like a less committed Van Gogh
And you, you are an angel, that's why you pray
And I am an ass, and that's why I bray
Your halo slipped to frame you like a photo, a porthole window
I see blood spill in the pure snow
You see sweet sauce on ice-cream cones
And you, you are an angel, that's why you pray
And I am an ass, and that's why I bray
If you were tomorrow, I'd be today
And this is the end
(I'm serious, so listen now)
Baby, I got the death rattle, and baby, I got it bad
I've been digging my grave for quite some time
When I'm not digging up the past
And I chewed my only necktie
From the metal frame of my bed
Where I tied your wrists together
Spent all night givin' (Oh, you get the message though)

Not headstone, but headboard
Is where I want to be mourned
Not headstone, but headboard
Is where I want to be mourned
Not headstone, but headboard
Is where I want to be mourned
Not headstone, but headboard
Is where I want to be mourned
Not headstone (not headstone), but headboard (but headboard)
Is where I want to be mourned
Not headstone (not headstone), but headboard (but headboard)
Is where I want to be mourned
Not headstone (not headstone), but headboard (but headboard)
Is where I want to be mourned
Not headstone (not headstone), but headboard (but headboard)
Is where I want to be mourned3Embed
