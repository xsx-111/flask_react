Life Is a Long Time Lyrics
My brown eyes are two pools of mud
Resting in two dark moons
They turn the tide into a flood
And the bloodshot lines in the whites
Map every A-road in this town
All the glare of the city lights
Every cul-de-sac we've talked down
Over time they build up the city
And our arguments show it all
Every ring road, every motorway
Displayed in crease and wrinkle
Until my face is a map you have folded up
One hundred, one thousand times

You know it starts pretty rough
And ends up even worse
And what goes on in-between
I try to keep it out of my thoughts

Your blue eyes are like the deepest and warmest seas
As the salt elevates my body
They float my heart up past my teeth
And with the water and the Cypriot sun
Would your psoriasis bleach and be gone?
But would it fix the pallor of my skin?
Or would my freckles all meld into one?
Your body above me, sobbing down
My cheeks wet from your tears
They extinguish each of the burning thread
Veins flow down to my ears
Now they rest in two tiny reservoirs
That overfed the wedded canals
You know it starts pretty rough
And ends up even worse
And what goes on in-between
I try to keep it out of my thoughts


And life, life is a long time
Too long to my mind, too long by far
Between my waterfalls and your landslides
There's cartography in every scar
Life, life is a long time
Too long to my mind, too long by far

Because it starts pretty rough
And ends up even worse
And what goes on in-between
I try to keep it out of my thoughts
You know it starts pretty rough
And ends up even worse
And what goes on in-between
I try to keep it out of my thoughts
You know it starts pretty rough
And ends up even worse
And what goes on in-between
I try to keep it out of my thoughts
You know it starts pretty rough
And ends up even worse
And what goes on in-between
I try to keep it out of my thoughts2Embed
