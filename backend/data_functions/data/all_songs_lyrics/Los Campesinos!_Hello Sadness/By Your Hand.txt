By Your Hand Lyrics
By your hand is the only end I foresee
I have been dreaming, you've been dreaming about me
By your hand is the only end I foresee
I have been dreaming, you've been dreaming about me

I was sitting on my hands at the top deck of the 178
Spitting cusses at my face reflected in the windscreen pane
Throwing insults and calling names
Filthy SMSs that you sent through the day
By sundown, become tame
So I set it in motion again
But fate's a cruel mistress, girl, the prettiest in the world
She dresses loosely in a bathrobe with her hair up in curls
'Cause we were kissing for hours with her hands in my trousers
She could not contain herself, suggests we go back to her house
But here it comes, this is the crux, she vomits down my rental tux

I'm not sure if it's love anymore
But I've been thinking of you fondly for sure
Remember what your heart is for

By your hand is the only end I foresee
I have been dreaming, you've been dreaming about me
By your hand is the only end I foresee
I have been dreaming, you've been dreaming about me
And it's a good night
For a fist, a fist fight
Because the dew will temper your fall
You'll sing me lullabies in form of your cat-calls
And I've been dangling in limbo, barely keeping my cool
It's like I'm snookered 'tween the back cushion and touching the 8-ball
Keep replaying my turn until your patience is shot
You peel your white gloves off seductively before you re-spot
Your fingertips leave marks and graze, I lay you down atop the baize

I'm not sure if it's love anymore
But I've been thinking of you fondly for sure
Remember what your heart is for

Graceful, gracious companion
With your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion
My gracious companion
With your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion

By your hand is the only end I foresee
(My gracious companion
With your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion)
I have been dreaming, you've been dreaming about me
(My gracious companion
With your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion)
By your hand is the only end I foresee
(My gracious companion
With your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion)
I have been dreaming, you've been dreaming about me
(My gracious companion
With your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion)5Embed
