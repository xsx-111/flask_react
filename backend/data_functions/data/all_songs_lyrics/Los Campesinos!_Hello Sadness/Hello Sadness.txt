Hello Sadness Lyrics
A wishbone hangs between your breasts
I hope you haven't pulled it yet
And if this little finger doesn't have the strength
Then I'm scared that this bird's back bone breaks

It's only hope that springs eternal
And that's the reason why
This dripping from my broken heart
Is never running dry

I wear a ring of your lipstick
Around the knuckle of my fourth digit
It reminds me what our bodies sowed
It will do until we are betrothed

It's only hope that springs eternal
And that's the reason why
This dripping from my broken heart
Is never running dry
Never running dry

The space between your navel
And your waistband was the ice
Where two fingers pirouette
But now these hang nails, they just slice
It's only hope that springs eternal
And that's the reason why
This dripping from my broken heart
Is never running dry
Never running dry

Your tongue, the tide, your lips, the shore
I am the jetsam overboard
Goodbye courage
I christen all the ships that sailed
On your little kisses' saliva trails
Goodbye courage
Hello sadness, again

Little kisses come to pass, then
Goodbye courage, hello sadness

It's hope that springs eternal
And that's the reason why
This dripping from my broken heart
Is never running dry
It's hope that springs eternal
And that's the reason why
My broken heart is never running dry
Now that those four fingers gone
You leave me only with my thumb
That constantly is pointing down
The emperor bears teeth not frown

It's only hope that springs eternal
And that's the reason why
This dripping from my broken heart
Is never running dry
Never running dry3Embed
