Hate for the Island Lyrics
Recall the time we straddled your windowpane
Smoked the last of the weed that sent you insane
In a public loo in a borough of London that I won't mention
You phoned me in Minnesota, said you had a vital question
And as we smoked, you feared you neighbours might see
We watched a fox rip out the contents of each
Bin-bag that lined the road and then you turned to see me, mouth
"Those entrails are how I'll feel when you decide to leave me"
Now I've a whole lot of hate for the island
Since your friends buried you down there
Six feet deep beneath the sand
But at least I know we'll never be that far now from each other
Just a couple of hundred feet either side of sea level
It's no lie if the waters rose
And drowned that place from coast to coast
You wouldn't see this smile leave my face for all eternityEmbed
