The Black Bird, the Dark Slope Lyrics
The black bird sits atop my guts and spreads its wings for flight
My shoulders back, my jaw pushed out, my stomach sucked in
Its wingtips push across my lungs and fill them full of feathers
But the brushstrokes feel like hearth pokes into my skin
The black bird feasts upon my guts and bears its beak to fight
My shoulders back, my jaw pushed out, my stomach sucked in
Its wingtips push across my lungs and fill them full of feathers
Now they poke between my teeth and that's why I thirst

And when he flies me to the top
There's nothing but the fog
A heart of stone, eggshell for bones
They lead you to be lost

The dark slope drags you down
The dark slope drags you down
The dark slope drags you down
The dark slope drags you down
The black bird is a part of me (The dark slope drags you down)
A part of me, so sad to see (The dark slope drags you down)
The black bird is a part of me (The dark slope drags you down)
So sad to see, so sad
I ask before I go for you to drop a lit match down my throat
And smoke the bastard out, it'll burn him to a crisp
'Cause I'm already carrion, been eaten from the inside too long
This black bird wants to rip me limb from limb
The black bird dips its beak in blood
And writes its thoughts in cursive
'Cross the bones that are its jailer and my ribcage
And when you turn me inside out
Believe in me, without a doubt
The words were all of his and none of mine

And when he flies me to the top
There's nothing but the fog
A heart of stone, eggshells for bones
They lead you to be lost

The dark slope drags you down
The dark slope drags you down
The dark slope drags you down
The dark slope drags you down
The black bird is a part of me (The dark slope drags you down)
A part of me, so sad to see (The dark slope drags you down)
The black bird is a part of me (The dark slope drags you down)
So sad to see, so sad to be me1Embed
