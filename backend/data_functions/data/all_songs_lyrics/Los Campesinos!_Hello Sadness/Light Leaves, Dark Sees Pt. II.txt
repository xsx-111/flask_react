Light Leaves, Dark Sees Pt. II Lyrics
I part the curtains (I part the curtains) of your hair
And all the light of the sun floods the room
Poured from your sleepy stare
Two seconds each morning (Seconds each morning) without fail
Before I enter the abattoir to see my insides hanging there
But they request that I leave
'Cause my sad eyes are too much to bear

When the light leaves
Then the dark sees
When the light leaves
Then the dark sees

Your hands to your hips now (Your hands to your hips now)
Two swan necks
Curl between pelvis with stretch-marks
And shoulders with those freckle flecks
The pain of the silence (The pain of the silence) before bed
Oh, for the sound of your pissin' through the thin walls
Or stroking your head
But for the shadows and doom
And the sorrow we seem to have bred
When the light leaves (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Then the dark sees (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the light leaves (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Then the dark sees (Oh-oh)
Oh, when the light leaves (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Then the dark sees (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the light leaves (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Then the dark sees (Oh-oh)
When the light leaves (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Then the dark sees (Oh-oh)Embed
