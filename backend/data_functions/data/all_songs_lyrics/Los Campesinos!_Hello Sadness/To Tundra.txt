To Tundra Lyrics
Meet me at St. Nicholas
Among the oaks, behind the church
That sway like pig-tailed girls as summer wind whistles
Around your bare-skin knees and the forsythia leaves
In the shade, lay with me
Tickled by the feather reed
That's where the trees grow old under the ivy's hold
As you in my two arms, equally safe from harm
And in a hazy day dream, our bodies married the stream
And we grow down into pebbles and silt
The water ran from the fields until the oceans were filled
And found the sea bed the comfiest quilt


There was more life in the weeds than in the few hundred seats
In rows from transept to chancel to nave
And when their anger had paused
I turned and answered their calls
With, "You're just audience, I'm the applause"
We take on the burden of all these sad-eyed children
With lilies bunched in our hands
We fake our concern and speak softly as the surgeon
Tells wife to cancel her plans
Take a body to water, take a body to tundra
Just take me with you as well
Please take a body to water, take a body to tundra
Just take me with you as well2Embed
