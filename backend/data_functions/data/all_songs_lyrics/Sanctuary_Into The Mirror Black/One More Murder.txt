One More Murder Lyrics(Written by: L. Rutledge & W. Dane)
These day it's a cold reality, living life on the street
No time left to bite the hand that feeds
The lure of money corrupts the weak, and soon they fall
Little boy turns to man with a weapon when
He's poisoned with crack
This time it was his turn to dies
Fate call his number in a bloody goodbye
Play war games, crack cocaine, all for material gain
Stray gunfire an innocent dies
The shadow of hope bleeds as power begets greed
One more murder and one more death
Make no difference in the street
Come tomorrow you could be dead
That's the grim reality
And the media they feed off the sickness
They stoke the fire as they eat
All the while being glamorized by rap
The lure of power creates a death trap of social decay
Play war games, crack cocaine, all for material gain
In the end, your life is spend
The shadow of hope bleeds as power begets greed
One more murder and one more death
Make no difference in the street
Come tomorrow you could be dead
That's the grim reality
One more murder
Makes no difference in the street
One more murder
That's the grim reality
No future, no future, no future on the streetEmbed
