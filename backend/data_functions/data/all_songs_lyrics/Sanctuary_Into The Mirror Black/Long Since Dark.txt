Long Since Dark Lyrics(Written by: L. Rutledge & W. Dane)
It's been long since dark
Sitting here bathed in the moonshade
Underneath a willow'tree
To stare above, the sky is burning
The diamonds dance in nocturnal symphony
What does it mean? How do I fit into the scheme?
Why is there dark sky above, what does it veil?
Is there a purpose to the point
Beyond the norm we hail?
Reflecting on my future to come
Underneath the crescent moon
Long since dark, and my thoughts are flowing
And deeper still, beyond the cloak of unknown
Relentless drone, why was I put here, left alone?
Why do I hunger to know what will I gain?
Is there true wisdom without end
Or will I find just pain?
How many times do we take for granted
Simple things that make life sweet
Enraptured by material longings
We miss the point, we need to know, to see
Beyond your being, and in the void lies the meaning
Just as the dark sky above had spoke to me
The answer came so clear, then vanished
For a moment I was free
I am freeEmbed
