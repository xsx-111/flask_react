Seasons of Destruction LyricsFeel my pain, live my sorrow
Do you know me, I am destruction
Conflicts brings, eternal devastation
Kill the war pigs, who deceive the nations
Hear this message across the sea of the dead
Will we ever live this dream I have bled
And through politics and crime
Forgotten future dies, the season has begun
To rise again
And in the dark we weep
We cry and we sing, don't let it all begin
These times are seasons of destruction
And each day is a little more cold
Reasons why elude those who structure our lives
So make a change, before it's too late
Look around you see the world that we've made
This grand creation, our human race
No control, no help from above
It's up to mankind, what we live in fear of
Feel this message implanted in your head
We will never live to see the bloodshed
Stop the conflicts coming rise
Before seasons of destruction drag us down
Baptismal fire
And through this mystic dawn
Our minds are free and strong
Born again as one
These times are seasons of destruction
And each day is a little more cold
Reasons why elude those who structure our lives
So make a change, before it's too late
Feel my pain, hear my warning
Kill the war pigs, there's a new age dawningEmbed
