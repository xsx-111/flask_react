Eden Lies Obscured LyricsThe quest for Eden leads us on, fuel to theorize
Is there a place in time where war and peace collide?
Our lives begin naked and unknowing
Given time we spoil as desire shapes our will
Sing unto me sinners, the masses are on fire
The flames skin deep through the core of life
The minions learn through fear and uprise
Fading in the distant haze the myths we've made burn on
Sing a song of sadness of lunacy's mad lore
Bastardized by the dogs of war
A woman still pure made a whore
Leaders throughout history killed for Eden's gain
No one knows where Eden lies
Between hope and fantasy so pure
No one knows where Eden lies
Fools sits on high so Eden lies obscured
From our view
Inside your mind is the key to the garden's gate
The quest for Eden leads us on, fuel to theorize
Is there a place in time where war and peace collide?
Sing unto me sinners and share with me your minds
The keys to knowledge we seek to find
Those who conform push thorns in our eyes
But still I persist join in my cause
For change is eclipsed by apathy
No one knows where Eden lies
Fools sit on high, so Eden lies obscuredEmbed
