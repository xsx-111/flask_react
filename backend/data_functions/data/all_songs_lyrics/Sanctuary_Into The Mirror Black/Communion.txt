Communion Lyrics(Written by: L. Rutledge, W. Dane, S. Blosl & D. Budbill)
I will not worship your deity
There is no place in your religion for me
Slaves to the vision of a dying world
I malign
One with the universe, one star will shine
Who will be chosen, not one will know
The path to the perfect way, it is slow
All needs and all human traces of thoughtlessness
I resign
I pray to the alien, and we align
Greater understanding really isn't hard to find
Never will you see unless you open up your mind
Religious misdirection washes out reality
Tear down the facade and see into infinity
Communion is evolution
Of the mind to a higher form of reason
Communion, a resolution
A search for inner peace
I will not worship your deity
There is no place in your religion for me
Slaves to the vision of a dying world
I malign
One with the universe, one star will shine
Greater understanding really isn't hard to find
Never will you see unless you open up your mind
Religious misdirection washes out reality
Tear down the facade and see into infinity
Communion is evolution
Of the mind to a higher form of reason
Communion, a resolution
A search for inner peace
Communion is evolution
Of the mind to a higher form of reason
Communion, a resolution
A search for inner peaceEmbed
