Taste Revenge LyricsYou take the first blow, I taste revenge
Let anger come my will is done, malicious in my intent
The hate is rising, the swell of fear takes over
And, oh the taste is sweet my friend
So bittersweet
No more anger, I've had my revenge
Beg for mercy, I'll take you down
No more hatred, I've had my revenge
Eye for an eye, taste my revenge
Revenge
Caught in a time warp, rage in the wind
The shock of surprise still in your eyes
As you met your violent end
Your strength was failing, degrading you was power
My recourse is complete my friend
So bittersweet
No more anger, I've had my revenge
Beg for mercy, I'll take you down
No more hatred, I've had my revenge
Eye for an eye, taste my revenge
As you implore on bended knee
Do you regret what you've done to me?
No matter how you plead, I'll take you down
The hate is rising, the swell of fear takes over
And, oh the taste is sweet me friend
So bittersweet
No more anger, I've had my revenge
Beg for mercy, I'll take you down
No more hatred, I've had my revenge
Eye for an eye, taste my revenge
As you implore on bended knee
Do you regret what you've done to me?
No matter how you plead, I'll take you downEmbed
