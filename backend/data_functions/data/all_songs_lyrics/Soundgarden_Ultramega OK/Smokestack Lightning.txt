Smokestack Lightning LyricsHey, smokestack lightning, yeah
Hey, ooh, shining like gold
Hey, smokestack lightning
Yeah, ooh, shining like gold
Hey, hey, hey
Treats me like a clown
Wheels go driving slow
Trucks me out of town
Wheels go driving slow
Tell me, baby
So when are you coming home?
Tell me, baby
When are you coming home?
Wheels go driving slow
Wheels go driving slow
Wheels go driving slowEmbed
