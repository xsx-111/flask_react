Incessant Mace Lyrics
So he's afraid he'll suffer his father's fate
Two sets of silverware, cups, and plates
Two burning hands and bleeding hearts
Don't feel it's not too late to start


Only the photographs on your wall
Are chained and down your hall
Reminding you of all the days
When you collected hell to pay

Well hell to pay
I said it's not too late
No, it's not too late
Incessant mace
Incessant mace
Oh God, I can see it
You know it's incessant mace


Magazine stacks and broken backs
Are what you get for piling stacks
Buried deep in your treasure chest
You wonder why you're under stress
You're under stress
I said, it's not too late
No no, it's not too late
Yeah, it's not too late
Incessant mace
Incessant mace, oh yeah
Incessant mace
Incessant mace
Oh God, I can see it
You know it's incessant mace, mace, maceEmbed
