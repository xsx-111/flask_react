Circle Of Power LyricsThe day will finally come in
And opened the door
Cause we have conquered a kingdom
And a place of rage
Covered with assholes
They burn on their knees
Well here we live
To see their fear and their trembling words
Of a volunteer
A pretty, pretty blank name on the list
An "x" for every accomplished deed
Ol' big bad ass circle of power's comin' to getcha!
Not necessarily dumb, but just uh... beautiful... beautiful
Well it's the circle of power
And it's all
It's all the same
Ah the circle, spinning the circle of power
And it's under different names
Oh the circle of power
It's all the same
The circle of powerEmbed
