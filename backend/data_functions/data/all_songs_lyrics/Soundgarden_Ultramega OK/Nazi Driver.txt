Nazi Driver LyricsI don't care if it takes some time
I'm gonna make it right
I'm gonna make it right
Turn your head 360 degrees
Bite the hand that feeds
I don't care if it tastes like poison
Rip the legs from the thighs
Feed the prison, save the eyes
I don't care if it tastes like poison
I'm going to feed the prison, feed the prison
Color in with lakes of red
Pile of bones for my bed
I'm gonna take some time
I'm gonna take some time
Hang your sides to cure it right
Feed the prison, save the eyes
Not a tear will be shed
The only color is red, red
I don't care if it takes some time
I'm gonna make it right
I'm gonna make it right
Turn your head 360 degrees
Bite the hand that feeds
I don't care if it tastes like poison
Rip the legs from the thighs
Feed the prison, save the eyes
Not a tear will be shed
The only color is red, red
I don't care if it tastes like poison
I'm gonna feed the prison, feed the prison
I'm gonna feedEmbed
