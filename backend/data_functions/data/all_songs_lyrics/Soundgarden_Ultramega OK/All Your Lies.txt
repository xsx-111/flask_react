All Your Lies Lyrics
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies

See through your triples, falling, limping, crawling
Biting, fighting back from dying
Endless ending, comprehending
Nothing of the sin she's sinning

Loosely buying your cheating, your lying
Will make it mine while never crying
Corralled like a cat with my head in a sack
And I feel like I'm tied to a railroad track

All your fears are lies

All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
See through your triples, falling, limping, crawling
Biting, fighting back from dying
Endless ending, comprehending
Nothing of the sin she's sinning

Loosely buying your cheating, your lying
Will make it mine while never crying
Corralled like a cat with my head in a sack
And I feel like I'm tied to a railroad track


All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies
All your fears are lies

(See through your triples, falling, limping, crawling
Biting, fighting back from dying
Endless ending, comprehending
Nothing of the sin she's sinning
Loosely buying, your cheating)
Loosely buying your cheating, your lying
Will make it mine while never crying
Corralled like a cat with my head in a sack
And I feel like I'm tied to a railroad trackEmbed
