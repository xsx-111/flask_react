Head Injury Lyrics
Wow!
Head injury
Head injury
Head injury

You got a kiss for me, it hits me hard
You got a fist for me, your love is so hard
My hand on my head, your words are like arrows
My hand on my head, there's permanent damage

Hey, head injury
Head injury
Head injury

You got a kiss for me, it's sweet and frail
You got a fist for me, sure to impale
My hand on my head, your words are like arrows
My hand on my head, my mind's growing narrow

Head, head, head, head
Head injury
Head injury
You got a kiss for me, it's sweet and frail
You got a fist for me, sure to impale
My hand on my head, your words are like arrows
My hand on my head, my mind's growing narrow

You got a kiss for me, it hits me hard
You got a fist for me, your love is so hard
My hand on my head, your words are like arrows
My hand on my head, my mind's growing narrow

Head, head, head, head
Head, head, head, head
Head, head, head, head
Head, head, head, head
Head, head, head
Head injuryEmbed
