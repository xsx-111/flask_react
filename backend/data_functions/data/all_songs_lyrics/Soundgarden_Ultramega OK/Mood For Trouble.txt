Mood For Trouble Lyrics
My mood was in full swing
My mood was in full swing
I wanted to be free
Free to want so stale
I did not want to hear
The perfect thing to say
Dying to squeeze out
The ugly truth for everyone to hear

Admit
You believed
Your perfect pool of lies
And now
If you could say it
Everything would be all right

I did not want to fight
I did not want to kill
I wanted to be real
I wanted to believe
That I was not the only one alive1Embed
