Wild Lyrics
My mother said to me, that I would get in trouble
Our father won't come home 'cause he is seeing double

Out in the endless green your eyes are so misleading
That's when your car pulls up, its hood is black and gleaming

And in a while you start to smile
The earth is wild, you've got no time

Wild in our ways, what we are making
Heartless to say, go on pretending
Wild in our ways, what we are making
Heartless to say, you go, go on pretending

One chance to fall behind, the lines that would not let you
Can I believe in how the past is what will catch you?

And in a while you start to smile
The earth is wild, you've got no time
Wild in our ways, what we are making
Heartless to say, go on pretending
Wild in our ways, what we are making
Heartless to say, we go, go on pretending
Wild in our ways, go on pretending7Embed
