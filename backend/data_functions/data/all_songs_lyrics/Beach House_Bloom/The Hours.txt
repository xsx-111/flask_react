The Hours Lyrics
Something, something
Aah, aah

Can I wait the hours 'til you find me?
Climb up to the tower so that you could see
Violence in the flowers where they found you
Can I wait the hours?
Would it be untrue?
Climb up to the tower so that you could see
All across the hours

Frightened eyes looking back at me
Change your mind, don't care about me
Frightened eyes looking back at me
Change your mind, don't leave without me
Frightened eyes

Made in your reflection so that you could feel
Mad in your intentions, fear it isn't real
All the recollections spinning in a field
Left in your possession 'til it isn't real
You say it isn't real
Frightened eyes looking back at me
Change your mind, don't care about me
Frightened eyes looking back at me
Change your mind, don't leave without me
Frightened eyes

Deeper than you and me
It's farther than you could see
Is it too much to ask, tell me
It's all in a glance, you'll see
It's deeper than you and me (Looking back at me)
It's all in a glance, you'll see (Don't care about me)
It's farther than we could be (Looking back at me)
It's deeper than you and me (Don't care about me)
