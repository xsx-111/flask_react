Lazuli Lyrics
In the blue of this life
Where it ends in the night
When you couldn't see
You would come for me

Wonder eyes, motion high
And we don't dare slip on by
Make us suffer like no other

There's nothing like lapis lazuli
Let it go back to me

Like no other, you can't be replaced
Like no other, you can't be replaced
Like no other, you can't be replaced
Like no other, you can't be replaced
Like no other, you can't be replaced
Like no other, you can't be replaced
Like no other, you can't be replaced
Like no other, you can't be replaced
(There's nothing like lapis lazuli)
Like no other, you can't be replaced
(There's nothing like lapis lazuli)
Like no other, you can't be replaced
(There's nothing like lapis lazuli)
Like no other, you can't be replaced
(There's nothing like lapis lazuli)
Like no other, you can't be replaced
(There's nothing like lapis lazuli)
Like no other, you can't be replaced
(There's nothing like lapis lazuli)16Embed
