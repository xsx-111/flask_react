New Year Lyrics
All I wanted comes in colors
Vanish every day
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
We keep these promises, these promises

Can you call it? See it coming
Just enough to tell a story
'Bout a portrait of a young girl
Waiting for a new year

All you ever wanted
Is it getting away?
Visions of a feeling
The footsteps at bay
You were getting stronger
Memories again
Now you're open wider
It's better this way

All I wanted comes in colors
Vanish every day
I keep these promises, these promises
Stranger things will come before you
Always out of the way
We keep these promises, these promises
Won't you write a letter
On the page
In your own way
Write it in a letter
On the page
It's your own way

You were getting wiser
It's better this way
Faces in the mirror
Memories again
Now look to a feeling
It's lighter than breath
All you ever wanted
Is it getting away?

Can you call it? See it coming
Just enough to tell a story
'Bout a portrait of a young girl
Waiting for the ending of an era
Can you call it? See it coming
Just enough to tell a story
'Bout a portrait of a young girl
Waiting for the new year7Embed
