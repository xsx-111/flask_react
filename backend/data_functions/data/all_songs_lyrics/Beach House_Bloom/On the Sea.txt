On the Sea Lyrics
Out on the sea, we'd be forgiven
Our bodies stopped the spirit living
Wouldn't you like to know
How far you’ve got left to go?
Somebody’s child, nobody made you
It’s not what you stole, it's what they gave you
In or out, you go
In your silence, your soul

Would you rather go unwilling?
The heart is full and now it's spilling
Barreling down the steps
Only a moment left

In hind of sight, no peace of mind
You begin and I’m defined
Daughter of unconscious fate
Time will tell in spite of me
In hind of sight, no peace of mind
It begins and we're defined
Shadows bend and suddenly
The world becomes and swallows me in
Whistle to a friend
Gentle 'til the end
Any way, in a name
She takes shape, just the same28Embed
