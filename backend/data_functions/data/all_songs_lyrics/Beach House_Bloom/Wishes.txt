Wishes Lyrics
The roses on the lawn
Don't know which side you're on
In a daze, it will change

Wishes on a wheel
Wishes on a wheel

The voices in the hall
Will carry on their talking
Carry weight you can't take

Wishes on a wheel
Is it even real?

The contact that you make
The moment when a memory aches
Who can tell?
You do it well

Wishes on a wheel
How's it supposed to feel?
One in your life
It happens once and rarely twice
One in your life
It happens once and rarely twice

The roses on the lawn
Won't know which side you're on
On that hill, forever still

Wishes on a wheel
How's it supposed to feel?
Wishes on a wheel
