Myth Lyrics
Drifting in and out, you see the road you're on
It came rolling down your cheek, you say just what you mean
And in between it's never as it seems

Help me to name it
Help me to name it

If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give
What comes after this, momentary bliss?
The consequence of what you do to me

Help me to name it
Help me to name it

Found yourself in a new direction
Arrows falling from the sun
Canyon calling, would they come to greet you?
Let you know you're not the only one

Can't keep hangin' on to what is dead and gone
If you built yourself a myth, you'd know just what to give
Materialize or let the ashes fly
Help me to name it
Help me to name it49Embed
