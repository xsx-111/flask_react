Other People Lyrics
So you thought it would happen
Good love, goodbye
I know where no one can reach you
No, I don't mind

It's your world, why would you fake it?
These days go by
As you turn around, oh, oh, oh

Other people want to keep in touch
Something happens and it's not enough
Never thought that it would mean so much
Other people want to keep in touch

Heaven won't keep us together
Right place at the wrong time
It takes all kinds of weather
Distant new skies

Somewhere no one can reach us
These days go by
As you turn around, oh, oh, oh
Other people want to keep in touch
Something happens and it's not enough
Never thought that it would mean so much
Other people want to keep in touch

Was it ever quite enough?
Was it ever quite enough?
Was it ever quite enough?
Was it ever quite enough?
(Don't you know who's standing by me?)
(Oh, my love, just can't let you go)
Was it ever quite enough?
(Don't you know who's standing by me?)
(Oh, my love, just can't let you go)14Embed
