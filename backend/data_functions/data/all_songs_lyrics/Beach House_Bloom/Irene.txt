Irene Lyrics

Though you hardly know her
The light's on its way
The hand that rests upon it
Still wanna stay

No way of recognizing
The cat knows the call
Fair child is rising
There's no mystery at all

It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
You'll be waiting
You'll be waiting

It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise
It's a strange paradise

The kind you like
To come back in
Wherever you go
No hawk in sight
The scenic drive
The signs just so
The brightened lines
Stay by your side
Wherever you go
The kind you like
A comeback kid
They told you so
Wherever you go
No doubt it
It’s true
The lights up
Wherever you go
No doubt it
It’s true
The kind you like
No end in sight
The rest you know3Embed
