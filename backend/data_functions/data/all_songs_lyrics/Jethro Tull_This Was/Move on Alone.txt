Move on Alone LyricsI feel so sad now that she's gone
I've been loving that woman too long
There's no place to go because my friends have all moved
Got nothing but sit in the sun
Got tired of crying
Guess I'll move on alone
My bed is so empty and my heart is grown cold
Guess I'll just die before I grow old
The place is untidy, that's 'cause I ain't done my dirt
I just grown tired of thinking
Got tired of crying
Guess I'll move on aloneEmbed
