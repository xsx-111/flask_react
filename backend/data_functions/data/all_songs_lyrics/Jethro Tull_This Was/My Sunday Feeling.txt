My Sunday Feeling LyricsMy Sunday feeling's coming on over me
My Sunday feeling's coming on over me
Now that the night is over
Gotta clear my head so I can see
'Til I get to put together
That old feeling won't let me be
Won't somebody tell me where I laid my head last night?
Won't somebody tell me where I laid my head last night?
I really don't remember
But with one more cigarette I think I might
'Til I get to put together
That old feeling can't get me right
Need some assistance, have you listened to what I said?
Need some assistance, have you listened to what I said?
Oh, I don't feel so good
Need someone to help me to my bed
'Til I get to put together
That old feeling is in my head
'Til I get to put together
Oh, that old feeling is in my headEmbed
