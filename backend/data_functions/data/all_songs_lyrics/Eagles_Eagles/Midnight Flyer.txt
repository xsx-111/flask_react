Midnight Flyer Lyrics
Oo, midnight flyer
Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
Oo, midnight flyer
I paid my dues and i feel like traveling on

A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
So throw your rope on another man
And pull him down your way
Make him into someone who can take the place of me
Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be


Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe
Maybe San Antone
Any town is where I'm bound
Any way to get me gone
Don't think about me
Never let me cross your mind
Except when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine

I paid my dues and I feel like travelin' onEmbed
