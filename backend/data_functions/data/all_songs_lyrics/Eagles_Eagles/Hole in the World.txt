Hole in the World Lyrics
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

They say that anger is just love disappointed
They say that love is just a state of mind
But all this fighting over who is anointed
Oh how can people be so blind?

There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow

Oh they tell me there's a place over yonder
Cool water running through the burning sand
Until we we learn to love one another
We will never reach the promised land

There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
(They say that anger is just love disappointed)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
(They say that love is just a state of mind)
There's a hole in the world tonight
(But all this fighting over who will be anointed)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
(Oh how can people be so blind?)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Hole in the world)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (Fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight (There's a hole in the world)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (A cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
(Don't let there be a hole in the world, mmm)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm yeah)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
(Oh there's a cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight
(There's a hole in the world tonight)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow (Mmm)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Mmm)
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow (A cloud of fear and sorrow)
There's a hole in the world tonight (Great big hole in the world)
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrow
(Don't let there be a hole in the world)
There's a hole in the world tonight
There's a cloud of fear and sorrow
There's a hole in the world tonight
Don't let there be a hole in the world tomorrowEmbed
