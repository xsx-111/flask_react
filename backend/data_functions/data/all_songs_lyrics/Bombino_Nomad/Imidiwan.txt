Imarawane nanagh
Imidiwane, imidiwane
Wirhintitewegh
Awa ha nilmade
Dagh imarawane nanagh
Imidiwane, imidiwane
My friends, my friends
Never forget what
We learned from our parents
My friends, my friends
Let us not forget this heritage
That our parents have left us
Let us keep it fondly
This heritage is our identity
My friends, my friends!Embed
