Azamane Tiliade LyricsAwene azamane
Azamane n tilyaden
Tarha nasnate
Tiglate isgabayyine
Yallawate ayitma
Yoffa anulu gabba
Fel tilyaden nanagh
Tin n anada n azamane
This era
The era of young girls
Their way of loving
Works in a different way
Prayers to you, my brothers
Better to be attentive
For our girls
Those of this eraEmbed
