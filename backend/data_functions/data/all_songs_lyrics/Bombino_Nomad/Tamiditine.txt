Tamiditine LyricsNegham tarha
Chound tan ourou
Tamiditine chound tan ourou
Azamane idagh
Tarha n'eress tossod tissighaftou
Dagh manet
Har bass issane
Awa heggou
I am telling you, love
As it was
My darling, as it was
This time here
Love is everyone's worry
From the bottom of their soul
Without knowing
What to doEmbed
