Amidinine LyricsAmidinine, amidinine            (My friend, my friend)
Tada adounia tichagret        (This life is long)
Tada adounia gouzoul         (This life is short)
Sagglete s'immik iyyane      (Manage it in a certain way)
Was tarhed dagh manak     (The way that suits you)
Awa tarhed, arhekh             (What you desire, I desire it as well)
Iguekh dagh mane isiglekh(From the depth of my heart, I accept it)
Edag dossed kitawakh       (Everywhere I go, I'll think about it)Embed
