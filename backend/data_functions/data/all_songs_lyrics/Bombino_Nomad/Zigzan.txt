Kanik assistane
Tadagh sh adunia
Tayitey tanine

Tadagh sh adunia
Tilla daw itrane
This life needs patience
You go through life and it never ceases to question you
You have to face this life to overcome its obstacles
Patience will be your guide
This life needs patience
I remember this girl
Whom I left under the stars
Amongst those who invaded me
This life needs patience
When I returned, she was alone
Abandoned on this barren and deserted earth
Her memory haunts me day and nightEmbed
