Down Here on the Ground Lyrics
Down here on the ground
Ain't no place for livin'
Down here on the ground
Watching sparrows fly
I watch the birds
As they make their wings
They're flying kinda free
And I wish it were me, mhm, mhm, mhm

Down here on the ground
Wanting something better
Down here on the ground
Wanting something more, mhm

One morning soon
You'll find
I got wings on my mind
Wings to take me high
So, if you hear a sound
From down here on the ground
Don't you know, my friend, it's only me
It's only me tryin' to fly

Down here on the ground
Ain't no place for livin'
Down here on the ground
Watching sparrows fly
I'll watch the birds
As they make their wings
Flying kinda free
And I wish it were, wish it were me, mhm, mhm, mhm

Down here on the ground
Wanting something better
Down here on the ground
Wanting something more, mhm

One morning soon
You'll find
I got wings on my mind
Wings to take me high
So, if you hear a sound
From way down here on the ground
Don't you know, my friend, it's only me
It's only me tryin' to fly, mhm, woo-hoo

Down here on the ground
Mmm, right here down here on the ground
Woo-hoo-hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo-hoo-hoo, mmm
Want a little help now, y'all
I want a little help now
Hey, baby
Down here on the ground
Down, down, down here
On, on the ground


Down here on the groundEmbed
