Ontology Lyrics
Woo
(Woo)

Now there is something that's on my mind
Now there is something I cannot hide
Why is there anyone? Why do we think?
What is the point of it? Why anything?
Why is there anything? What is the link?
What is the point of it? Why anything?

Donâ€™t question
Thinking for yourself
Is an overrated thing
Be free
Woo

What can be said to exist inside
A simulation inside my mind?
What is the meaning? What is a thing?
What is the point of it? Why anything?
How many levels of ontology?
What is the point of it? Why anything?
Don't question
Thinking for yourself
Is an overrated thing
Be free
Woo
