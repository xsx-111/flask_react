Intrasport Lyrics
Don't take it personally, this is not about you
I begin to slide inward and throughout to
Shatter the static silencing my mind
Find the rhythm and set course to collide
Don't take it personally
My hands are disappearing
Dissolving in a tear
I am not needed here

Starting to feel something
I think I'm taking off
I think I'm feeling something
Will I evaporate?
Is this me feeling something?
I've got a bird's eye view
I have shed my skin
Look at me now

Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
I used to drеam about killing certain people
Drеams that sew me up like sleeping with a needle
Those feelings that I had were building up to something
I feel a schism in the rhythm, now I'm running
My hair is liquifying
My taste buds are igniting
It's true, I am evolving
It's all relative

Starting to feel something
I think I'm taking off
I think I'm feeling something
Will I evaporate?
Is this me feeling something?
I've got a bird's eye view
I have shed my skin
Look at me now

Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
Intra-intrasport
Perish to my thought
My hand is on the gun
It's intra-intrasport
Get to me before
My face splashes in the sky
Don't
Do
