Straws in the Wind Lyrics
Galvanising uncertainty
Mindful of the weary inkling that is lurking
Hierarchy, it's been cracking aegis
Embodied in this black heart shameless

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can see the Beelzebub Cheshire grin

Cooking something raw
Cooking something big
Pandemonium
Selfish pigs
Headless chickens
Scared shitless
The media
Will never quit


Allegro fueled with discontent
Mortal traffic lights signalling when to stay or go
Condescending expеndables botched to a clock
Novice to thе dilemma with nothing clever left in stock
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a blunder brewing full to the brim
I can hear Hell's kitchen and they're singing hymns

Cooking something raw
Cooking something big
Pandemonium
Selfish pigs
Headless chickens
Scared shitless
The media
Will never quit


The affluent with a bad omen hanging
Monstrosity scarce breaking freedom
Shrewd and not in the mood to disillude
We are the pillars of a forgotten pier

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?

(Is it all?) Is it all straws in the wind?
(Is it all?) Is it all straws in the wind?
(Is it all?) Is it all straws in the wind?
(Is it all?) Is it all straws in the wind?

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Like a slumber and we've all just awoken
I can see the Beelzebub Cheshire grin

Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?
Straws in the wind, is it all ending?2Embed
