Your Poison LyricsI've spent a lot of time
Good people
Trying to make it rhyme
Good people
It gave my mind a little place to hide
If you don't like my lines
Good people
You better open wide
Good people
Call the chief, it has become my belief that your tongue is the weapon
You cut what you reap with your poison
Your poison
Your poison
Your poisonEmbed
