Take Your Time LyricsSo she waits on the edges of the mattress
What it takes to get a bad mess out of a bad dress
When she sings, it's like a blue dove on a whipping post
When she speaks, she thanks the good Lord for the Holy Ghost
Take your time sweet thing
Take your time
Take your time sweet thing
Take your timeEmbed
