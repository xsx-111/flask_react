Dragonfly LyricsWe took our pills
It changed the world
We had our fill
But when we realized
That we were dragonflies
We knew we had to try to find a way to get more pills
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Oh dragonfly
Your thousand eyes
What do they see?
The lines of history
Some things should never be
Why do we even try?
There's no such thing as dragonfly pills
Maybe you're right
Maybe you're right
Oh dragonfly
Maybe you're rightEmbed
