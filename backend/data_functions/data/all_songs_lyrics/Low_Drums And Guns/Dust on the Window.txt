Dust on the Window LyricsDust on the window
The sun's darkened angle
Write your initials with mine
At this time tomorrow
I'll be just one day closer
One sunset further behind
In the morning I'll make up my mind
Always a whisper
Worthless and tender
A break in my arm that won't heal
You lie like a shadow
Your breath on my pillow
You won't let me keep what I steal
Tell me, where can a girl get a meal?Embed
