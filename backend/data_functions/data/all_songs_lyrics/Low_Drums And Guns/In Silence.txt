In Silence LyricsThey put the treasure deep inside us
Inside us
Inside us
They thought the desert would divide us
Divide us
Divide us
With silence
With silence
With silence
With silence
They filled our hearts and hands with violence
With violence
With violence
It's time to leave the fields behind us
Behind us
Behind us
In silence
In silence
In silence
In silence
In silence
In silence
In silenceEmbed
