Hatchet LyricsYou be my Charlie
And I can be your George
Let's bury the hatchet like the Beatles and the Stones
They'll play our songs forever on the radio
Let's bury the hatchet like the Beatles
The Beatles and the Stones
I know you've got a thing for ordinary guys
But I've heard your records and they sound a lot like mine
So you be my Marianne, and I'll be your Yoko
Let's bury the hatchet like the Beatles
The Beatles and the Stones
Like the Beatles
The Beatles and the StonesEmbed
