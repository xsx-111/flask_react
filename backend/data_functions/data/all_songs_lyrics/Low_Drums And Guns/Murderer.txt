Murderer LyricsOne more thing before I go
One more thing I'll ask you, lord
You may need a murderer
Someone to do your dirty work
Don't act so innocent
I've seen you pound your fists into the earth
And I've read your books
Seems that you could use another fool
Well, I'm cruel
And I look right through
You must have more important things to do
So if you need a murderer
Someone to do your dirty work1Embed
