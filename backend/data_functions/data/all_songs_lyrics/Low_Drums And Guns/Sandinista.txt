Sandinista LyricsWhere would you go
If the gun fell in your hand?
Home to the kids or to sympathetic friends?
Oh Sandinista
Oh Sandinista
Oh Sandinista, take my side
Deep through the clouds
Hear them marching up slowly
Fresh with the blood
Of your fathers, so holy
Oh Sandinista
Oh Sandinista
Oh Sandinista, take my side
Take my sideEmbed
