Violent Past LyricsAll I can do is fight
Even if I know you're right
All I can do is fight
Pretty fingers holding fast
Maybe it's your violent past
Maybe it's your violent past
All you can do is hide
God bless the darkness of the night
All you can do is hide
Pretty fingers, the golden calf
Maybe it's your violent past
Maybe it's your violent past
Maybe it's the violet path
Maybe it's your violent past
Maybe it's the violet path
Maybe it's your violent pastEmbed
