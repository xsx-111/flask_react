Anytime Lyrics
Go
Get it all
Let 'em watch
Let it fall
Nameless
Sweat it out
They don't love you
Do they?
And I
Carved your name
In the white
Dulling day
Couldn't believe
You were gone
Do you love me?

And the passing phases feel the same
Though you've got so much to do
In the end you could waste your whole life anyways
And I want better for you

Grace
Born and raised
Cut you down
Still bleeds the same
As it is
Unusually
Are you hung up?
Or do you love me?
And the passing faces look the same
Though they don't know you
In the end you could waste your whole life anyways
But I want better for you

And I'm not in love with your absence
'Cause I have fallen so hard for the space
And I've gotten to know the quiet
And still, for you, anytime
Still, for you, anytime
And still, for you, anytime7Embed
