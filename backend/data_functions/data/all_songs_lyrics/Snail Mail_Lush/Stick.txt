Stick Lyrics
Do you dream about the people that wrong you?
Do you see those faces again and again?
And what holy thing has come to possess you?
And does it all blend together in your head?

And did things work out for you?
Or are you still not sure what that means?
And it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink
'Cause I can't wash this one clean, clean

Did you tell all of your friends?
Did you tell all of your friends?
Maybe I could understand
What is it about them?
Would they stick around?
What is it with them?
And would they stick around?

Up late for six nights in a row
Figures in the dark, oh, they move so slow
Sleep with the lights on in the hall
And you'd leave the door open
It won't mean a thing at all
And did things work out for you?
Or are you still not sure what that means?
And it's a hard trip to the kitchen sink
'Cause I can't wash this one clean

Did you tell all of your friends?
Did you tell all of your friends?
And baby, I could understand
What is it about them?
Would they stick around?
And what is it with them?
And would they stick around?
Would they stick around?
Would they stick around?

And it doesn't matter
They're up and they're down
And I'll bet
They're at home
And I wouldn't worry
Who's happy alone
Even when it doesn't make sense3Embed
