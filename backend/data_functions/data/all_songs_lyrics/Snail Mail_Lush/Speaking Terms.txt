Speaking Terms Lyrics
Oh, don't see you now
Wait, don't just give out
Move from your old house
The city can be so loud

Say what you gotta
Sleep in somehow

Lose sight of wherever you are
Do you know when you've gone too far?
If it's all ash and dust
Well, then I won't let you take me for a ride

Say what you gotta
Sleep in somehow
Leave things on speaking terms
And I'll see you around
It's all ash and dust
And I won't let you take me for a ride
And it's all over us
And still I won't let you take me for a ride2Embed
