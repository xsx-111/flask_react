Heat Wave Lyrics
I'm so tired of moving on
Spending every weekend so far gone
Heat wave, nothing to do
Woke up in my clothes having dreamt of you

Swirl in the white evening sun
Tell me that I'm the only one
And I hope I never get a clue
Green eyes, I don't know what to do

And I hope whoever it is
Holds their breath around you
'Cause I know I did
And otherwise
If only sometimes
Would you give it up, green eyes?

Passing phases wear you thin
Same old world that you've been sleeping in
And I hope it never spends you up
Green eyes, what could ever be enough?
And I hope the love that you find
Swallows you wholly
Like you said it might
And otherwise
If only sometimes
Would you give it up, green eyes?

I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes
I'm feeling low
I'm not into sometimes8Embed
