Golden Dream Lyrics
Head below the surface of a frozen lake
Let in the black water, let it seep into my brain
God around your neck, though he never did too much for you
I wish I knew him better, though I don't think there's much he'd wanna do

I'm not yours
Know when I mean it
I'm not wasted anymore

Another night's impatience in an endless, perfect world
When morning bleeds into the golden dream just like before
Tomorrow I'll feel differently but my mind will be made up
In times when I could buy your love but I don't think that I have enough

I'm not yours
Know when I mean it
I'm not wasted anymore

Stupid, stupid, stupid me, me, me, me1Embed
