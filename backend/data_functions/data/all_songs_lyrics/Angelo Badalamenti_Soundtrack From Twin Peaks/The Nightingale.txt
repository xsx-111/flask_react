The Nightingale Lyrics
The nightingale
It said to me
'There is a love
Meant for me'
The nightingale
It flew to me
And told me
That it found my love

He said one day
'I'll meet you'
Our hearts will fly
With the nightingale
The nightingale
He told me
One day
'You will be with me'

The nightingale
Said he knew
'That your love
Would find my love one day'
My heart flies
With the nightingale
Through the night
All across the world
I long to see you
To touch you
To love you
