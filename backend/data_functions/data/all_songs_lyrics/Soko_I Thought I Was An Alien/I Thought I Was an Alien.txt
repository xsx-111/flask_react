I Thought I Was an Alien Lyrics
We met one day
When I thought I was an alien
I told you to get a costume
And dance with me like an alien

You told me that you were not quite a good dancer
I told you that I think it doesn't matter
We would just look dumber than we think we were
Then you looked at me as if I was a freak
But you said you like freaky people
So I thought you might like me a little bit

We met one day
When I thought I was an alien
I told you to get a costume
And dance with me like an alien
And you did
And you didEmbed
