How Are You Lyrics
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?

Isn't it the hardest question to answer to
When the only thing you want to say is bad
Isn't it the hardest question to answer to
When the only thing you want to do is cry
How are you?
How are you?

Oh, it is too hard
To look at you and smile
And just reply
I am fine
Cause you know I'm not
You know I'm not
Cause my eyes don't lie
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
Isn't it the hardest question to answer to
When the only thing you want to say is bad
Isn't it the hardest question to answer to
When the only thing you want to do is cry, cry

How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?
How are you?Embed
