Destruction Of The Disgusting Ugly Hate Lyrics
Scars on my heart
Can't you see
What have you done to me
Scars on my arms can't you see
Where I am sinking

Destruction of the disgusting ugly hate

I got a tattoo on my heart
Your name is written in black
You have tattoos everywhere
But my name is not there


I got tears on my cheeks
Rolling faster than a rocket ship
You stare at me
You do nothing
Now burning man please wake up and burn me

And now you're leaving
But can't you see
What have you done to me?
You're leaving me but can't you see
Where I am sinking
