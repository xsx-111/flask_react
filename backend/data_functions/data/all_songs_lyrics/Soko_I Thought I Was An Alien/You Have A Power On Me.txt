You Have A Power On Me Lyrics
Every little sign of you
Make me feel so happy
Every little word from you
Suddenly moves me
And I pass my day and my nights
Saying your name
And I pass my day and my night
Dreaming of you
Every little smile you make
Make me smile for days
Every little face you take
Make me lose my way
You have a power on me
That nobody else has on me
Like a bunny out of a magic hat
You're magical when you do that
Every little thing you do
Makes me want to do you
Every little smile you make
Makes me smile for days
Every little sign of you
Every little smile of you
Makes me so happy
And every little word you say
Suddenly moves me

You have a power on me
You're so magicalEmbed
