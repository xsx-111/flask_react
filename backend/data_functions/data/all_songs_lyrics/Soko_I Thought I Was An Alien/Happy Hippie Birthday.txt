Happy Hippie Birthday Lyrics
Today was your birthday
And I didn't know what to do
Are you supposed to call the people you love
When you know they don't love you
Today was your birthday
And I didn't dare to call
But I thought about you all day
Even at midnight I wanted to call
To be honored to be the first one to send you my love
And wish you

Happy hippie birthday

35 candles on a cake
That I will never taste
35 candles blown away
That I picture in my head
35 years old and I'm 22
And I remember when you used to say
That I was young but you didn't care at all

16 of June 1973 my parents hadn't even met
16 of June 1973 was born the only boy
I can ever love
We're 13 years apart like my parents were
We're 13 years apart and for them it worked out
They had me and my brother
As achievement of their love
They had me and my brother

My mother loved my father so
That she would never let him down
My father loved my mother so
That he would never let her down

He loved her until the day he died
She will love him until the day she dies
You could love me until the day you die
Because I will love you until the day I die
And even more2Embed
