No More Home, No More Love Lyrics
No more home
I downgrade on the couch again
I swear I'll make myself tiny
I just have a guitar and a suitcase with me

No more home
Much more worries
It was fun just for a second
To be a vagabond musician
But I could use some security now

And I just can't recall
How I did it before
Oh you're way stronger when you're young
I just have to learn it all again

No more love
I've been fired of my caretaker job
I'm always the one who love the most
And I suffer even more

And I just can't recall
How I did it before
Oh you're way stronger when you're young
I just have to learn it all again
I just have to learn it all againEmbed
