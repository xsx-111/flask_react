People Always Look Better In The Sun (Part 1) Lyrics
I thought it doesn't matter
He is ugly anyway
But today was a sunny day
I thought doesn't matter
He is ugly anyway
But today I crossed his way

People always look better in the sun

And I can see in the back of your eyes
That I'll have to choose another time
To say what's on my mind
I'll have to choose another time
To say what's on my mind
I'll have to choose another time
To say that


It's just a sunny day
Probably not the good day
To say
What's in my heart2Embed
