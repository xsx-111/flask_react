First Love Never Die Lyrics
I feel like walking
Do you feel like coming
I feel like talking because
It's been a long time

Now your hair is long
And you look so thin
You're always so pale
But something has changed
You're almost a man

4 years and I still cry sometimes
First love never die
4 years and I still cry sometimes
First love never die

Long time no see
Long time wondering
What you were doing
Who you were seeing
I wish I could go back to it
I feel like walking
Do you feel like coming
I feel like crying because
It's been a long time

4 years and I still cry sometimes
First love never die
4 years and I still cry sometimes
First love never die

Can you feel the same
I will never love again5Embed
