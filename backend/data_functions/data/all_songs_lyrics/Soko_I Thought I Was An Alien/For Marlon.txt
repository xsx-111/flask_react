For Marlon Lyrics
I broke my toes
'Cause when I'm sad
I get as clumsy as a stupid clown
But you're way too young to understand
And I'm way too desperate to be sane
So I fall for you like a fool for gold
'Cause you look so pure and I love your voice
I can hear the cracks of your youthful heart
And it makes me want to be
A part of that
Until I said
"What's there on your arm?"
You said, "Don't look, please don't ask"
I know you won't like to know that
I'm a recovering addict and sometimes I relapse

But if I get sober
Would you swear to love me?
If I get sober
Would you care for me?

And as I was ready and didn't care to doubt
The wheel has spin and left a drought
I thought I knew back then to never ever trust
Someone for who drugs come first
And I think there's no love
But just proof of love
And you've just proved me
That you'd never care
And it's been raining now for three days straight
As a sad reflect of my sorry state
And I remember you said with me you felt
The best that you've ever, ever felt
And I think that no drugs can replace
The warmth and tenderness that we embraced
But if you get sober
I will be here for you
If you get sober
I'll be yours for good5Embed
