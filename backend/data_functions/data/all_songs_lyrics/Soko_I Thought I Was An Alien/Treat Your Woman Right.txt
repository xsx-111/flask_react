Treat Your Woman Right Lyrics
You love the world more than you love me
Though you mean the world to me
Today my world is collapsing
Into the void of no return
Every word that come from your mouth
Is just another sign
For me to let it go
But it takes so long
And I'm not so strong
And I miss your face every day

You love your God more than you love me
Though you're a god to me
You've always wanted to protect me
But now, you're the one that hurt me

You talk to your wise men and they say
Women are only here to distract
You from your path so follow your track
Follow your path, follow your dreams
And let her down
You make big talks
And they equal
Do what I say not what I do
You love yourself more than you love me
Though I love yourself more than me
I let my ego drift away far so it won't come back
But now I'm losing my way

You're getting stuck
In your quest for fame, and women, and free love
And all your hippie theories
But don't pretend to be all loving
If you can't treat your woman right
Because you didn't treat your woman rightEmbed
