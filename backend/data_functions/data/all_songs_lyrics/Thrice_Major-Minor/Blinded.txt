Blinded Lyrics
I was always one of the righteous
Never lived outside of the lines
Kept a close watch on the whitewash
Disguising the dead bones inside
Disguising the dead bones inside

I was always one of the good ones
Keeping tabs on everyone else;
Sure that I was one of the chosen
I was a child of hell
I was a child of hell

But you buried me in the bright light
Yeah, you held my eyes to the sun
'Til I could see

That I was worse than I ever feared I could be
But somehow
I was loved more than I ever dared to believe
Because of you

I was always one of the blameless
Or at least that's what I believed
I never thought I could have been blinded
Until I could no longer see
Until I could no longer see
But you buried me in the bright light
Yeah, you held my eyes to the sun
'Til I could see that

I was worse than I ever feared I could be
But somehow
I was loved more than I ever dared to believe
You had shown me
I was worse than I ever feared I could be
But somehow
I was loved more than I ever dared to believe
Because of youEmbed
