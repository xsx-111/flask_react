Yellow Belly (Acoustic) Lyrics
You were built for blessing but you only make them bleed
But you don't care, you don't care
And bruises are but shadows of the blackness that you breathe
But you don't care, you don't care

The light that's left inside their eyes is darkened day by day
But you don't care, you don't care
Your presence pulls the color from the world 'till all is grey
But you don't care, you don't, you don't, you don't

'Cause you are less than half a man, yellow belly and crimson hands
You will one day reap your reckoning, maybe then you'll understand

Your hands are made to comfort but they only conjure fear
But you don't care, you don't care
She's in the closet praying, "Lord please get me out of here"
You don't care, you don't, you don't, you don't

'Cause you are less than half a man, yellow belly and crimson hands
You will one day reap your reckoning, maybe then you'll understand
You are less than half a man, yellow belly and crimson hands
You will one day reap your reckoning, maybe then you'll understand
What mercy have they known, from you, from you?
To ask that it be shown, to you, to you?
What mercy have they known, from you, from you?
To ask that it be shown, to you, to you?1Embed
