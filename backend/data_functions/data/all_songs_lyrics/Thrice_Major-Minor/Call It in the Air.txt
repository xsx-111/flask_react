Call It in the Air LyricsA coin tossed into the air will come down
It will come down somewhere
Your life is a coin in the air
It will come down, it will come down somewhere
Every coin does ring
Every coin will fall
Stop your wavering
Now's the time so call it out
A coin in the air, it will come down
It will come down somewhere
Every coin does ring
Every coin will fall
Stop your wavering
Now's the time so call it
In the air
You have to choose and what you stand to lose
You've been putting up all of your life
Call it in my hand
Only one way to see what the outcome will be
Call it out before we lose the light
No more stalling, no delay
You must call it out by light of day
Every coin does ring
Every coin will fall
Stop your wavering
Now's the time so call it
In the air
You have to choose and what you stand to lose
You've been putting up all of your life
Call it in my hand
Only one way to see what the outcome will be
Call it out before we lose the light
So heads or tails, there's nothing for it
So put an end to your sidestepping
Is it heads or tails, you can't ignore it
You stand to win or lose everything
Heads or tails
So put an end to your sidestepping
Heads or tails
You stand to win or lose everythingEmbed
