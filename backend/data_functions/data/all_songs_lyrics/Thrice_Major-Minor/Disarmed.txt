Disarmed Lyrics
We were sons of insurrection
Doomed to face the dark alone
Till vicarious perfection
Dearly won, was made our own

So where's your landslide, where's your victory?
Tell me now, where's your sting?

Unassailable you waited
The great enemy of man
Till your awful jaws were sated
And we were ransomed from your hand

So where's your landslide, where's your victory?
Tell me now, where's your sting?

Now that you have been disarmed
We will cross over unharmedEmbed
