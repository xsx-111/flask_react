Blur Lyrics
The shutter opens but never closes
I am lost, waylaid in light trails
Endless moments overlaid and burned across
A melee of scattered braille

This image is a night-terror transforming
Without the hope of morning
My nemesis, I feel it coming for me
And it means to destroy me

Why does this keep happening?
I try to close my eyes but I can't blink
And the world keeps moving on
Black and white blur into one

Hieroglyphic, indecipherable, opaque
The meaning escapes me
Dry and lidless are my eyes, asleep, awake
Reading the slurred debris

This image is a night-terror transforming
Without the hope of morning
My nemesis, I feel it coming for me
And it means to destroy me
Why does this keep happening?
I try to close my eyes but I can't blink
And the world keeps moving on
Black and white blur into
Why does this keep happening?
I try to close my eyes but I can't blink
And the world keeps moving on
Black and white blur into oneEmbed
