Promises Lyrics
Oh, we promise pretty things
We pledge with diamond rings
We profess undying love
But does that word hold any weight
When we reserve the right to break
Any vow that draws our blood?

Our word is so faint and feeble
Broken by the slightest breeze or breath
Our hearts are so deceitful
Sick and filled with lies that lead to death

We are cowards and thieves
Will we never turn to grieve the damage done?
Never see, never quake with rage at what we have become?
What we have become

Yeah we get down on one knee
Oh we play at chivalry
But we do not count the cost
We say, "On me you can depend,"
And "I will be there 'till the end,"
But we will not bear the cross
Our word is so faint and feeble
Broken by the slightest breeze or breath
Our hearts are so deceitful
Sick and filled with lies that lead to death

We are cowards and thieves
Will we never turn to grieve the damage done?
Never see, never quake with rage at what we have become?
What we have becomeEmbed
