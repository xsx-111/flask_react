Words in the Water Lyrics
Standing knee deep in
Cold water, swiftly moving
Somehow I knew I'd lost something
Wading waist deep
I saw a book there in the river
Waiting for me to find it there
I tried to read it
Neck deep, treading water
The tide, it pulled me out to sea

Then, with water in my eyes
The words began to rise from their place
They were beautiful and dread
I reached for them and fed on each phrase
They were honey on my lips
But then a bitter twist in my side
I knew they'd lay me in my grave
"Is there no one who can save me?" I cried

Sinking, down deep through
Cold water and heavy silence
Shadows stirring in the gloom
What things lay sleeping
Down deep in the darkness
Woke then, to find me in that tomb?

Then, with water in my eyes
The words began to rise from their place
They were beautiful and dread
I reached for them and fed on each phrase
They were honey on my lips
But then a bitter twist in my side
I knew they'd lay me in my grave
"Is there no one who can save me?" I cried

And when I lost all hope to look
Someone took that heavy book from my hands
All its weight they set aside
After they had satisfied its demands
I felt white and black reverse
And the lifting of a curse from my heart
Then like one receiving sight
I beheld a brilliant light in the dark2Embed
