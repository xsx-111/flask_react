Cataracts LyricsCut these thorns and kick these stones
Keep those birds at bay
Plant deep and dark, and help my heart
Receive the words you say
The words you say
Receive the words you say
Receive the words you say
Are somehow lost on me
They die on deafened ears
When you open up your mouth to speak
I hear but I can't hear
The words you say
Hear the words you say
Hear the words you say
I can't hear the words you say
Hear the words you say
Pin me down, and take away
This heart of stone
Wind and sound awake my old dry bones
Cut these thorns and kick these stones
Keep those birds at bay
Plant deep and dark, and help my heart
Perceive the light of day
I stumble through a darkened vale
With a veil cast over me
And cataracts, all is black
Oh, I see but I can't see
The light of day
See the light of day
See the light of day
I can't see the light of day
See the light of day
I'll fight or run to keep from going under the knife
Don't let me slip away
Though the blade is sharp, I know you're saving my life
Don't let me slip away
Pin me down, and take away
This heart of stone
Wind and sound awake my old dry bonesEmbed
