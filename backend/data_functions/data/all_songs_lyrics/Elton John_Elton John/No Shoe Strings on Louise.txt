No Shoe Strings on Louise Lyrics
Lady love rides a big red Cadillac
Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean

So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise

Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swine herd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow

So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise
Oh yeah
All those city women want to make us poor men
And this land's got the worse for the worrying
Yeah, I got married at the early age of fourteen
And I've been worrying about the way you'll be loving them

Yeah, so ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise, oh, yeah
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise, yeah, ohEmbed
