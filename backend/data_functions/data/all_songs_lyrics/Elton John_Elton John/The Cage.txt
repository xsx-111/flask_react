The Cage Lyrics
Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed?
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

Well, I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then breaks all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed?
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ha
Oh-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-haEmbed
