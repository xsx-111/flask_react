Rock and Roll Madonna Lyrics
If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well, don't you try to stop me, I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned

Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows

Well, if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two-wheel combination
And I swear it's gonna be the death of me

Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows
(Rock on, baby!)
(Whoo! Yeah, yeah)
Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows

Let's get a little bit lower
Let's get a little bit lower
Oh, you're standing alright
Single, baby? Ah, yeah, that's pretty good
Now, is everybody gonna rock on with me?
One more time

I said, that's my rock and roll Madonna, aw, everybody
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, but no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows, yeah1Embed
