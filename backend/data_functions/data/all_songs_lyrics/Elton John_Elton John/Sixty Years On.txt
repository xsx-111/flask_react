Sixty Years On Lyrics
Who'll walk me down to church
When I'm sixty years of age
When the ragged dog they gave me
Has been ten years in the grave
And se√±orita play guitar
Play it just for you
My rosary has broken
And my beads have all slipped through

You've hung up your great coat and
You've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in
Wasn't too much fun

And the future you're giving me
Holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living
Sixty years on

Yes, I'll sit with you and talk
Let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers
Would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ
Plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low
When you are passing through
And the future you're giving me
Holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living
