Green River LyricsHey green river what can I do?
If it's alright I'll walk next to you
Sit in the shade of your beechwood trees
Don't you know these days I ain't hard to please
Sprinklers coming on
A shower in your lawn
And the runoff feeds the flow of your muddy waters
And many thousand friends
Lay before your concrete banks
Cause you know we are all your sons and daughters
Hey green river what can I do
If it's alright I'll walk next to you
Sit in the shade of your beechwood trees
Don't you know these days I ain't so hard to please2Embed
