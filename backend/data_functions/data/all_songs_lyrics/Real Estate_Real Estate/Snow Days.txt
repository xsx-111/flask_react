Snow Days LyricsOh, you walk so slowly
Under the pull of this high tide
Thinking about the old days
Thinking about these lines
February down by the shore
The waters never freeze
Despite the ice and snow
The snow up to your knees
Bright gray skies make your eyes feel sore
As you walk into the breeze
All you had to know
You knew when you were threeEmbed
