Fake Blues LyricsJust last year seemed so long
When I used to live alone
Now sell shit on the phone
Cause I don't want to live at home
Well it's not as if I choose
To be set with these fake blues
But your worries ain't so different from my own
Though I'm far more accident prone
People ask me for my name
But this number's just the same
If this is all just a game
I have only myself to blame
Well it's not as if I choose
To be set with these fake blues
But I've got to find a reason to write this song
And I won't be here for long1Embed
