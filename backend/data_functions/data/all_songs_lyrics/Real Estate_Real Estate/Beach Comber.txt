Beach Comber LyricsWhat you want is just outside your reach
You keep on searching
You're walking down that Pensacola Beach
You keep repeating
While you're waiting for that sound
Apparatus to the ground
You're stealin' from the lost and found
And what you find
Ain't what you had in mind
Until you find your Rolex in the sand
You won't be stopping
Until that solid gold is in your hand
You won't be happy
Call your office on the phone
Say you won't be coming home
You fell into vacation zone1Embed
