S.A.L.T. LyricsDid you ever get the felling you're being followed?
Are you not familiar with the Revelations of St.John
The final book of the Bible, prophesied the apocalypse
He forced everyone to receive a mark on his right hand
Or on his forehead so that no one shall be able
To buy or sell unless he has that mark
Which is the name of the beast and the number of his name
And the number of the beast is '6 6 6'
What can such a specific prophecy mean?
What is the mark?
Well, the mark is the bar-code
The ubiquitous bar-code that you'll find on every bog roll
And every packet of Johnnies and every poxy-pork-pie
And every bar-code is divided into two parts by three markers
And those three markers are always represented by the number six
'6 6 6'
And what does it say?
No one shall be able to buy or sell without that mark
And now what they're planning to do
In order to eradicate all credit card fraud
And in order to precipitate a totally cashless society?
What they're planning to do
And they've already tested it on the American troops
They're gonna subcutaneously laser-tattoo
That mark onto your right hand or onto your forehead
They're going to replace plastic with flesh, fact
In the same book of Revelations
When the Seven Seals are broken open on the Day of Judgment
And the seven angels blow their trumpets
When the third angel blows her trumpet
Wormwood will fall from the sky
And wormwood will poison a third part of all the waters
And a third part of all the land and many, many, many people will die
And you know what the Russian translation of wormwood is?
Chernobyl, fact
On August the 18th, 1999
The planets of our solar system
Are going to line up into the shape of a cross
They're going to line up in the big signs
Of Aquarius, Leo, Taurus and Scorpio
Which just happen to correspond
To the four beasts of the apocalypse
As mentioned in the book of Daniel, another fact
Do you think that the amoeba ever dreamed
That it would evolve into the frog?
And when that first frog shimmied out of the water
And employed its vocal chords in order to attract a mate
 a predator
Do you think that that frog ever imagined
That incipient croak would evolve
Into all the languages of the world
Into all the literature of the word, possibly?
And just as that froggie could never have possibly
Conceived of Shakespeare
So we can never possibly imagine our destiny
Look, if you take the whole of time represented by one year
But only in the first few moments of the 1st of January
It's a long way to go
And no, we're not going to sprout extra limbs and wings and things
Because evolution itself is evolving
When it comes, the apocalypse itself will be a part of the process
Of that leap of evolution
By the very definition of Apocalypse
Mankind must cease to exist, at least in a material form
We'll have evolved into something that transcends matter
Into a species of pure thought, are you with me?Embed
