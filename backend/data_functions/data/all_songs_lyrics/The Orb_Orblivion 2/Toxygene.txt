Toxygene Lyrics
(Oh, what a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before)
(Oh, what a beauty, It must be two foot long or even more)
Each time I see a little girl of five or six or seven
I can't resist the joyous urge to smile and say
Thank heaven for little girls
For little girls get bigger every day!
Thank heaven for little girls
They grow up in the most delightful way!
Those little eyes so helpless and appealing
One day will flash and send you crashin' thru the ceilin'
Thank heaven for little girls
Thank heaven for them all
No matter where no matter who
Without them, what would little boys do?
Thank heaven, thank heaven
Thank heaven for little girls!Embed
