Mother Mary Lyrics
Try to make some changes really on the line
Given your religion, never ever time
All the jokers laughing, queens upon the floor
Mothers understand it, baby needs some more

Oh held up to ransom, quick hand and a gun
Just your education, hard to understand
Will the teenage legend make a mark on you?
Make a big time status, a pen will run them through

Mother Mary could you ever really feel the same?
Would you try to understand a wild colonial boy?


Try to make some changes really on the line
Given your religion, never ever time
All the jokers laughing, queens upon the floor
Mothers understand it, baby needs some more

Mother Mary could you ever really feel the same?
Would you try to understand a wild colonial boy?
