Too Much of Nothing Lyrics
I really tried my hardest just to make you understand
What it feels like to a boy when he don't feel like a man
But you gave me so much money and you would not understand
I realise I hurt you, so I stay just as I am

But the whole world keeps on turnin'
Yes, the whole world keeps on turnin'
But the whole world keeps on turnin'
I just roll along

There's been one too many mornings and one too many years
One of life's delinquents who just can't take the pace
We found it out the hard way, I hope you understand
That my life is just my habit and I had an overdose

But the whole world keeps on turnin'
Yes, the whole world keeps on turnin'
But the whole world keeps on turnin'
I just roll along

I used to try, oh, I used to try
Used to cry, oh, I used to cry

But the whole world keeps on turnin'
Yes, the whole world keeps on turnin'
But the whole world keeps on turnin'
I just roll alongEmbed
