A Million Miles Lyrics
Seems I lost my direction
Was it all just in a word?
Thought I found that something's real
Now I'm lost, don't know where to go

Never knew a love song I could sing
All the words to make me right
But you see you mean everything...
Yes to me, I want you by my side

If we turn a million miles away
Just a shoe string for a name
Oh, baby, baby, I'm a long way
Long way home

Can't do nothing 'bout the way it's been
And I'll see you's just a bad mistake
Or about things, they happen that way
I get lost, don't know where to go

If we turn a million miles away
Just a shoe string in a name
Oh, baby, baby, I'm a long way
Long way home

If we turn a million miles away
Just a shoe string for a name
Oh, baby, baby, I'm a long way
Long, long, long long way home
And if we turn a million miles away
Just a shoe string for a name
Baby, baby, baby, I'm a long way
A long, long, long long way homeEmbed
