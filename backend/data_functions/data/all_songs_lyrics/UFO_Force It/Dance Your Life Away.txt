Dance Your Life Away Lyrics
In a dance band competition, fox-trotting with my girl
Dance, dance, dance all night, dance your life away
High geared razzle dazzle, recession is the trouble
Dance, dance, dance all night, dance your life away

Thirty hours on the floor and twenty partners left
Dance, dance, dance all night, dance your life away
Feel so tired it must be a week, nearly on my knees
Dance, dance, dance all night, dance your life away

California, you always seem to have the sun
But I never really got near to it
And you turn your hand at anything you know
Just to try and earn a dollar


In a dance band competition fox-trotting with my girl
Dance, dance, dance all night, dance your life away
High geared razzle dazzle, recession is the trouble
Dance, dance, dance all night, dance your life away
California, you always seem to have the sun
But I never really got near to it
And you turn your hand at anything you know
Just to try and earn a dollarEmbed
