Love Lost Love Lyrics
Saturday night, all alone looking for some thrills
Try to catch the band's last song
Back stage pass really showing out
Feel that's where I belong

Sitting down, all the big stars at the bar
Really have a rock vocation
Monopemania, schizophrenia
Rise to any situation

Love, oh, lost love
Where will you go
When the show is over?
Nobody wants to know

We need to feel
Something that's real
'Cause you're losing from the start
So be careful with your heart

We need to feel
Something that's real
'Cause you're losing from the start
So be careful with your heart

Partners in the next bed
And they're dancing cheek to cheek
And I understand their hot wire conversation
Yes, you're pretty. Who needs a pretty face?
With a hot lips reputation

Love, oh, lost love
Where will you go
When the show is over?
Nobody wants to knowEmbed
