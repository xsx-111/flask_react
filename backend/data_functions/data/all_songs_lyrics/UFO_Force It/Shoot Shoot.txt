Shoot Shoot Lyrics
Was a fast tough woman, loved to play the clown
You won't do nothin' about it
Break a good boy's resistance down

Know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
She said shoot shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for me

Convinced me that she was worth it
Never knew I was her kill
And two 45's would do the trick and pay the bills

Know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
And she said shoot shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for me

I've really got to get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here now

Holdin' out in my hotel room
And police they finally come
Had her as the prosecution
And my prints upon the gun

Know she's got a pistol
Laid it down on me
And she said shoot shoot, shoot it boy
You gotta shoot it for me

I've really got to get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here
Gotta get a fast ride out of here nowEmbed
