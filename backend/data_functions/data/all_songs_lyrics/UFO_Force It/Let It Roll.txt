Let It Roll Lyrics
Cold run speed highway was the place where we'd all go
When our nerves were razor sharp, and we'd all let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll, let it go, let it roll
Machine's geared up, and we're really layin' it down, layin' it out
Let it go


When these wheels get rollin', let them roll right over you
'Cause I'm well greased down, and I'll always win it through
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Machine's geared up, and we're really layin' it down, layin' it out
Let it go


Cold run speed highway was the place where we'd all go
When our nerves were razor sharp and we'd all let it roll
Let it roll, let it roll, let it go, let it roll
Machine's geared up, and we're really layin' it down, layin' it out
Let it rollEmbed
