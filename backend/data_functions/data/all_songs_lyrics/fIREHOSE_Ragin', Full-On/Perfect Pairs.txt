Perfect Pairs LyricsWith the message comes pain
With the dreams come sadness
With the emptiness comes reality
Staring me in the eye
With the contact comes questions
With the love comes pain
With confusion comes the hate
Clear as a bell
With the time comes the answer
With the knowledge comes the end
With the conclusion comes the sanity
(just a little bit too late)Embed
