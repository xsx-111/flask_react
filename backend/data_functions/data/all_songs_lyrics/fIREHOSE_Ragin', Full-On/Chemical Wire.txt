Chemical Wire LyricsI'm the paint on the road
The weight of your load
With the cracked glass ground
Fuck it!
An itch in your brain
In the drain shootin' rain
I'm the flame from the train
I've been smeltin' rail
Flood from the fire
A hot tub cool mire
Ticket to fly her? NO
Then blaze chemical wire
Blazin' chemical wire
Burn the church from the spire
You fuckin' pay for desire
Fire turns your wire
This torch is for hire
Turn an ice man a cryer
Make your bed a big brier
Thorns of chemical wire
You'll be the tread on the tire
Sulfur in a deep fryer
Grinding on till you're tired
When you'll break down beside herEmbed
