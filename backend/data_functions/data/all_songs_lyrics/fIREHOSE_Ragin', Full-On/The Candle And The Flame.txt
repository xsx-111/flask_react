The Candle And The Flame LyricsWhere are you gonna find your peace
A story or a life?
If we've learned how to live
Fear will find no room
Exchange conversation if you dare
Share an empty thought or laugh
Is everything here connected?
The candle and the flame
There's no reason to think so
And just as much tonight
I'd be a fool to say the way
I'd put it in my pocket if I thought it would fill it
I'd put it in my heart if I thought I believed it
Exchange conversation if you dare
To share an empty thought or laugh
Is everything here connected?
The candle and the flame
There's no reason to think so
And just as much tonight
I'd be a fool to say the way
Is everything here connected?
The candle and the flame
There's no reason to think so
I'd be a fool to say the way
Fool would say the wayEmbed
