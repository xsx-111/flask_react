Choose Any Memory LyricsEnough today
Too long silent
Please send a feeling
Think me a thought
Gone too far again
To no surprise (no surprise of mine)
Direct stellar contact
Wait for dark (waiting for dark)
Hear me! hear me!
I sometimes know
It felt so near
Don't close sad eyes
Choose any memory
Gone too far again
To no surprise (no surprise of mine)
Direct stellar contact
Wait for dark (waiting for dark)
Hear me! hear me! hear me! hear me!Embed
