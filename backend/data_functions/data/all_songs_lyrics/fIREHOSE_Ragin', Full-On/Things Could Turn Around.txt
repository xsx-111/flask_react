Things Could Turn Around LyricsSilence to regain composure
Or rather music to soothe
Maybe a little magic could help
Things could turn around
Freeze this mood for now
Hold tight till it thaws
Wetness pulled out of me
So I'll cry less easily
A hasty decision
Hardly used
Jokingly punished
Icy fingers touch warmth
Trickles to the floor
Wetness pulled out of me
So I'll cry less easily
Wetness pulled out of me
So I'll cry less easily
Wetness pulled out of me
So I'll cry less easilyEmbed
