Under the Influence of Meat Puppets Lyrics
The future holds a mystery
We talk but don't know
We hope but can't tell
We share but not all
The mystery holds fast
The future: scary
It eludes us though we try to find meaning everywhere
We want to make plans
But to make another mistake?
So difficult we care enough to try
So crazy
So we sit and wonder...Embed
