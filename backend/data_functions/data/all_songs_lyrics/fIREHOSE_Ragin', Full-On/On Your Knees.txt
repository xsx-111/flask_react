On Your Knees LyricsA political contribution
Like the weeds in a garden
Eyesore for the future
Can you take my pardon?
Savage or a saint?
Automation has trances
In my working state
Think I got a chance
I've been on my knees
Better get on your knees
Your knees, your knees, your knees
Get down on your knees
You better get down on your kneesEmbed
