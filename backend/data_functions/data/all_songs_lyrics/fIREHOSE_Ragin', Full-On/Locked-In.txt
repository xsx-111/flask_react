Locked-In LyricsLocked-in to a dream
Step by step
Crawling but static
Unchanged
Unchanged
Locked into emotion
Finely tuned
Aching to escape
Harmful, harmless
Unfounded
Unfounded
Locked-in to this world
Sinking in
Deeper, colder
Stiff with reality
Unclouded
Unclouded
Locked-in to the end
Hoping to find
A dream, emotion, world
Tied together
Unending
Unending
In the final moment
In the final moment
In the final moment in the final momentEmbed
