It Matters LyricsHow to say it
When it don't come
I'm not tryin' to be vague
But silent anyway
Confusion
With a smile and a sigh
I'm glad for a friend though they really know it matters
(it matters)
If it don't come
And the tears still do
If the smiles not there
They could turn away
If no love shows
There might be none received
Always need help but never do enough for anyone
I can't do enough never strong enough for myself
It should work but
Mistakes take over
Bad outweighs good
Hardly believin' it
Never acceptin' it
So disappointed
And glad for a friend though they really know it mattersEmbed
