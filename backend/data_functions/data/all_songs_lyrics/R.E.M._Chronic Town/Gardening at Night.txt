Gardening at Night Lyrics
I see your money on the floor
I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door
Just didn't seem to be too real
The yard is nothing but a fence
The sun just hurts my eyes
Somewhere it must be time for penitence
Gardening at night is never where

Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night

The neighbors go to bed at ten
Call the prayer line for a change
The charge is changing every month
They said it couldn't be arranged

We echoed up the garbage sound
But they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun
Gardening at night just didn't grow
I see your money on the floor
I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door
Just didn't seem to be too real
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night

Your sister said that you're too young
They should know they've been there twice
The call was two and fifty-one
They said it couldn't be arranged

I see your money on the floor
I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door
Just didn't seem to be too real
We echoed up the garbage sound
But they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun
Gardening at night just didn't grow

Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at nightEmbed
