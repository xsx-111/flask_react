Carnival of Sorts (Box Cars) Lyrics
There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel
Diminish, a carnival of sorts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts

Gentlemen don't get caught
Cages under cage
Gentlemen don't get caught
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town

There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel
Diminish, a carnival of sorts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts

Gentlemen don't get caught
Cages under cage
Gentlemen don't get caught
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Cages under, cages under
Cages under cage
Cages under, cages under
Cages under cage

Gentlemen don't get caught
Cages under cage
Gentlemen don't get caught
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town

There's a secret stigma, reaping wheel
Stranger, stranger to these parts
Chronic town, poster torn, reaping wheel
Diminish, stranger

Gentlemen don't get caught
Cages under cage
Gentlemen don't get caught
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town
Boxcars (are pulling) out of town1Embed
