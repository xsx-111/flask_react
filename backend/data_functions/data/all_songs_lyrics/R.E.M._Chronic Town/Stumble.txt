Stumble Lyrics
We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the APT
We'll stumble through the yard

Force fields explorer racing
Home the ancient star
Yellow mixed with golden hue
And scan the graveyard dead there be

Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Ball and chain

We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the APT
We'll stumble through the yard

Force fields explorer racing
Home the ancient star
Yellow mixed with golden hue
And scan the graveyard dead there be
Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Ball and chain

(Chain, chain, chain, chain)
(Chain, chain, chain, chain)
(Chain, chain, chain, chain)
(Chain, chain, chain)

We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the APT
We'll stumble through the yard

Force fields explorer racing
Home the ancient star
Yellow mixed with golden hue
And scan the graveyard dead there be

Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Ball and chain
It was round about midnight, hipster town, imagine going for a walk, things get around to taking place
It's not a waste of time, the rich got a little poorer
Hipster town, imagine going for a walk and things get around to taking place as if they're going to happen at all
Don't need that jazz, don't need that stuff
It was round about midnight, hipster town
It was round about midnight
Hipster town

We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the yard
We'll stumble through the APT
We'll stumble through the yard

Force fields explorer racing
Home the ancient star
Yellow mixed with golden hue
And scan the graveyard dead there be

Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Ball and chain
Ball and chainEmbed
