1,000,000 Lyrics
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier, but smarter, too
Smarter too
All along the tomb
All along the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier, but smarter, too
Smarter, too

I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million years

Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter, too
Smarter, too
All along the tomb
All along the ruin
Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier but smarter, too
Smarter, too
I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million years

All along, all along, all along the tomb
The secret in, the secret in, the secret in the ruin

Secluded in a marker stone
Not only deadlier - smarter, too
Smarter, too

I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million
I could live a million yearsEmbed
