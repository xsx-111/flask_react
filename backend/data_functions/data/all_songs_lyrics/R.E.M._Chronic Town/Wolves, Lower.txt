Wolves, Lower Lyrics
Ah! (Wolves)

Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught
Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself and let us out
Wilder, lower, wolves
Here's a house to put
Wolves out the door

In a corner garden
Wilder, lower, wolves
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
Down there they're rounding a posse to ride

Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught
Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself and let us out
Wilder, lower, wolves
Here's a house to put
Wolves out the door
In a corner garden
Wilder, lower, wolves
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
Down there they're rounding a posse to ride

Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, don't get caught
Suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself, suspicion yourself
Wilder, lower, wolves
Here's a house to put
Wolves out the door

In a corner garden
Wilder, lower, wolves
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
(House in order) Oh
Down there they're rounding a posse to rideEmbed
