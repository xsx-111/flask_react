Treasure Hunt LyricsI don't know where to go
I don't know where to go, to go
I don't know where to go, to go
See the clues it's the place to go
And I don't know which one to choose
Your chance is up and it's time to go
And who cares (no one) if you lose
I thought I knew what I was looking for
I had a dream, a dream to treasure
He said follow and I'll make it true
So I put my trust in you
But you pushed me in the wrong direction
And who cares (no one) if you lose
I don't know where to go, to go
I don't know where to go, to go
I said let go and let me fall
You make me crawl when I should be running
Does anyone know what I'm looking for
'Cause it's not here at all
Everyone points to different clues
And who cares (no one) if you lose
I don't know where to go, to go
I don't know where to go, to go
I don't know where to go, to go
I don't know where to goEmbed
