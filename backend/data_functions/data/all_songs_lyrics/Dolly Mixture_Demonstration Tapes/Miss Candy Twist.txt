Miss Candy Twist LyricsTake a cool cool stare at Miss Candy Twist
A blonde black leather fan
If there's none of herself in anyone else
You'll just have to attract a man
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be?
She'll take a cool cool stare at your image, kid
She won't believe that it's her own style
How? Since she knows that it's just a pose
And won't listen to your demand
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be?
Just to hear her seek her resting man
We suppose she'd be your friend
But you'll find out it won't taste the same
With a bitter sounding end
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
This candy twist, woah oh
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be? Woah oh
Miss Candy Twist
What do you want us to be?Embed
