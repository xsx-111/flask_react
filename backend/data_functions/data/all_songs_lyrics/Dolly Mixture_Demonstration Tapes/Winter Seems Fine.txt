Winter Seems Fine LyricsDon't I know
That every time
I love you lose one tear
And I know
If I don't mind
That tear will gather more
More and more
Won't help you
It's all just gone too far
So like me
And so like you
It's always hard to find
A way to be
To have some joy
And not to feel unkind
So it always happens
Your last chance ends up mine

Winter seems fine
You know the troubles of mine
But is there anyone there
When I need someone to care?
Winter seems fine
You know the trouble's not mine
But is there anyone there
When I need someone to care?
Don't you know
That every time
You love I lose one tear
And you know
If you don't mind
That tear will gather more
More and more
Won't help me
It's all just gone too far
More and more
Won't help me
It's all just gone too far

Winter seems fine
You know the troubles not mine
But is there anyone there
When I need someone to care?
Winter seems fine
You know the trouble's not mine
But is there anyone there
When I need someone to care?Embed
