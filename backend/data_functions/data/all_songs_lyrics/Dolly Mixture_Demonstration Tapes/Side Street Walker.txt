Side Street Walker LyricsI used to see a lot of you
Just knew you as a friend
She arrived, and though I tried
Our friendship had to end
But first I talked to both of you
'Til slowly she drove me away
As time went by, I start to cry
'Cause I miss those halcyon days
I know my way down the side streets now
Na na na na na
Away from the places that you walk
I know my way down the side streets now
Na na na na na
And I can't see you walk along or watch you talk
She used to spit at me but you
Laugh like it was a game
As time went by, I realized
She'd come first in every way
You say that you don't want to lose
The love that you have found
Why should I be forced to hide
Out of sight 'til she's not around?
I know my way down the side streets now
Na na na na na
Away from the places that you walk
I know my way down the side streets now
Na na na na na
And I can't see you walk or watch you talk
I know my way down the side streets now
I know my way down the side streets now
Away from the places that you walk
Away from the places that you walk
I know my way down the side streets now
I know my way down the side streets now
Away from the places that you walk
Away from the places that you walk
I know my way down the side streets now
Na na na na na
Away from the places that you walk
I know my way down the side streets now
Na na na na na
And I can't see you walk or watch you talkEmbed
