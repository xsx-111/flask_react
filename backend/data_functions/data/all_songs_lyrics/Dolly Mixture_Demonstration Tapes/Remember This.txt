Remember This LyricsI'll never forget
Oh in years to come
One day I'll return
But until then
This journey won't end till all said and done
In many ways it's just begun
Remember this
A promise from another time
What ever else I lose
This is mine forever
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
When so much can change
Familiar to strange
And I'm lost again
So far to go
The one thing I know will still be the same
On that I can always depend
Remember this
A promise from another time
What еver else I losе
This is mine forever
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Remember this
A promise from another time
What ever else I lose
This is mine foreverEmbed
