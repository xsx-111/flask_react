Step Close Now LyricsStep close now
And I will show you how
To make the city turn to gold
Don't you know
The dust in our eyes
All kisses surprise
Before it turns back into stone
Ba ba ba ba ba whoah oh
Ba ba ba ba ba whoah oh
Thought you a long time
But were just not moving
If I could touch you
Then we'll feel so sure
Then
Step close now
And I will show you how
To make the city turn to gold
Don't you know
The dust in our eyes
All kisses surprise
Before it turns back into stone
Ba ba ba ba ba whoah oh
Ba ba ba ba ba whoah oh
For two minutes we can be alone together
Let's go dance, don't stand around forever
So we've been everywhere
But the sea and the street and our home
But the street makes it bad
And the sea is just a growing stone
For two minutes we can be alone together
Let's go dance, don't stand around forever
Step close now and (I can show you how)
Step close now and (Turn the city into gold)
Step close now and (Fill your eyes and notice how)
Step close now and (The boring times like these go)Embed
