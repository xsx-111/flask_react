Angel Treads LyricsThere's an angel treading on my dreams
Always someone watching over me
To keep me happy and care free
There's an angel treading on my dreams
La da da da da da
There's an angel treading on my dreams
Ah ha ha hey hey hey
There's an angel treading on my dreams
Wants to give me everything I need
Oh what can I do to make you see
You're an angel that's treading on my dreams
La da da da da
There's an angel treading on my dreams
Oh ha ha hey hey hey
Those who should tread carefully
Just get in the way
Don't I know you mean to please
But it's not for you to say
There's an angel treading on my dreams
If it's true that angels all have wings
Why don't you fly away from me
You're an angel that's treading on my dreams
La da da da da daEmbed
