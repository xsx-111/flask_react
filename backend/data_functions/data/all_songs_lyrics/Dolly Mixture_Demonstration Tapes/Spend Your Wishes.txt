Spend Your Wishes LyricsTry to spend your wishes carefully
Try to spend your wishes carefully
Try to spend your wishes carefully
Try to spend your wishes
So
Time I stepped inside to let the end go by
She does this I know
A chance she calls her own
Just would sit alone
To remind her
The only thing she hadn't done
Was to save a wish for the time that's come
This doesn't mean that she sang
Would you spend your wishes so
She could live for the memories
She's only got herself to please
Now she's outcast and she's sitting alone
Rather than decide
She let the chance go by
Too much baby
Not having shared a life
No one would care
She was lonely
The only thing she hadn't done
Was to save a wish for the time that's come
This doesn't mean that she sang
Would you spend your wishes so
She could live for the memories
She's only got herself to please
Now she's outcast and she's sitting alone
The only thing she hadn't done
Was to save a wish for the time that's come
This doesn't mean that she sang
Would you spend your wishes so
She could live for the memories
She's only got herself to please
Now she's outcast and she's sitting alone
Oooh oooh ooh ooh oooh oooh
The only thing she hadn't done
Was to save a wish for the time that's come
This doesn't mean that she sang
Would you spend your wishes so
Would you spend your wishes so
Would you spend your wishes soEmbed
