Shonay Shonay LyricsDo you remember that time on vacation
When I left you crying at the station?
I was excited by the hurrying crowd
By all that was busy and bright and loud
Shonay, Shonay, I haven't got you there
And you ought to know that I really did care
I've tried to think of things I should be doing
But all that comes, is I've been losing (I've been losing) you
Please understand, it was my first stab at love
I needed you, but that just wasn't enough
And you were a snow angel but I acted so bad
To recall that you loved me makes feel so sad
But you can blame the other people for the trouble we had
Shonay, Shonay, I haven't got you there
And you ought to know that I really did care
I've tried to think of things I should be doing
But all that comes, is I've been losing (I've been) losing you
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
I've been losing you
Shonay, Shonay, I'm upset
I'm sorry and I deeply regret
The way I neglected you
The way I rejected you
When all that comes is I've been losing (I've been losing)
Please understand it was my first stab at love
I needed you but that just wasn't enough
And you were a snow angel but I acted so bad
To recall that you love me makes me feel so sad
But you can blame other people for the trouble we had
Shonay, Shonay, I haven't got you there
And you ought to know, that I really do care
I've tried to think of things that I should be doing
But all that comes, is I've been losing you (I've been losing you)Embed
