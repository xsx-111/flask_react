Will He Kiss Me Tonight LyricsGirls who fall in love, ooh ooh ooh
Seem like fools to me
The things they do, ooh ooh ooh
I find it oh so corny like
Then a boy like you
Had you ask me out
Tonight's the night when I
Find out what it's all about
Doesn't matter if the stars aren't bright
I really don't mind if there ain't no moonlight
I don't believe in love at first sight, but
Will he kiss me tonight?
I'm not going to try, oh oh oh
To do what he expects me to
Not going to hold his hand, no no
Or say I love you
All I want to have
Is a different kind of romance
I'll have to see it through and
Maybe take a chance
Doesn't matter if the stars aren't bright
I really don't mind if there ain't no moonlight
I don't believe in love at first sight, but
Will he kiss me tonight?
All I want to have
Is a different kind of romance
I'll have to see it through and
Maybe take a chance
Doesn't matter if the stars aren't bright
I really don't mind if there ain't no moonlight
I don't believe in love at first sight, but
Will he kiss me tonight?Embed
