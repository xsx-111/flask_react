Ernie Ball LyricsIt was cold when I lost him
My hands were numb so I dropped him
Where has my Ernie gone?
Are you lying in the gutter?
Doesn't really seem to matter
All I know is I miss you
Time has gone since we've parted
And I'm still brokenhearted
Never find another pick like you
Are you lying in the gutter?
Doesn't really seem to matter
All I know is I miss you
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie Ball
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie Ball
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie BallEmbed
