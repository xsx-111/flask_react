Never Let It Go LyricsSo many moments gone
Lost in days that pass so carelessly
If each one had a song
In the few notes and suddenly
I could remember things
Forgotten until now
Reach out and catch the sun
Before the world has turned around
And taken it away
For once in a lifetime
And I won't ever have to let it go
For once in a lifetime
Of my own, never gonna let it go
Woah oh, woah
A face that 
A picture that you 
Make a story of today
Colors rushed and tears don't fade away
I could paint windows in
Every blackened wall
Take ahold of what you've found
Before the world has turned around
It's mine forever, hey!
For once in a lifetime
And I won't ever have to let it go
For once in a lifetime
Of my own, never gonna let it go
Woah oh, woah
For once in a lifetime
And I won't ever have to let it go
For once in a lifetime
Of my own, never gonna let it go
Woah oh, woahEmbed
