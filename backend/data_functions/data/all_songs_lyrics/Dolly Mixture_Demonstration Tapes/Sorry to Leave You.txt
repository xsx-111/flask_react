Sorry to Leave You LyricsSo here we are once more
I've seen this all before
Tonight I really know
That it's time for me to go
I don't know what to say
I'll hurt you anyway
Though you'll find a way to hide
You're breaking up inside
I feel it over and over again
I'm sorry to leave you
It's turning over and over and now
It's gone for my mind
And left on my heart
It's gone too far
My heart was split in two
Between my friends and you
It's a lesson I have learned
And got nothing in return
Looking back I see
But in reality
It didn't work I know
But it's hard to let you go
I feel it over and over again
I'm sorry to leave you
It's turning over and over and now
I'm sorry to leave you
I feel it over and over again
I'm sorry to leave you
It's turning over and over and now
It's gone for my mind
And left on my heart
It's gone too farEmbed
