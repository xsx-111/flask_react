Thief In The Night LyricsWatch and pray for I shall come like a thief in the night
Watch and pray for I shall come like a thief in the night
Look into yourself, mankind, can't you see
That the time is near
Can't you see that His hand is writing upon the wall
When His time is near you shall see signs and wonders
Two shall be let sleeping and one, one shall be taken away
But small as a flea is
In a oppressor, oppressor collar
He's not safe, for when I shall come
It shall be terrible and dread among men
Watch and pray for I shall come like a thief in the night
Watch and pray for I shall come like a thief in the night
You'd better watch out
Watch and pray for I shall come like a thief in the night.......Embed
