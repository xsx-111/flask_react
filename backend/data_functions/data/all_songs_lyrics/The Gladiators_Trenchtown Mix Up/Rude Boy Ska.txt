Rude Boy Ska LyricsWhy-
Shoobe-doobe-do-by dey
Won't you come dance with me
Me want you come wheel an' turn me
Go lick me head 'pon de tamborina
I've got to keep on movin'
Dreadlocks dread
Shoobe-doobe-do-by dey
Wanti wanti cyaan get it, an' getti getti no want it
Gimme little soul oh Lord
Dreadlocks dread
Shoobe-doobe-do-by deyEmbed
