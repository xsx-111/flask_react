Know Yourself Mankind LyricsOur beautiful country have turned into battle field
Ev'ry day, yeah, is rumours of war
Remember what marcus have said:
"man a go know themselves when dem back is against the wall"
This is 1976 - we don't want no more war
Callin' north, south, eas' and wes'
It's full time for i an i to know ourselves
But hate had made us to forget
Jah didn't make us live like wild beasts
No more fightin' - no more killin'
Let love and beauty abide, oh yeahEmbed
