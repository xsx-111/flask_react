Bellyfull LyricsOh oh oh, a ya-so it a go dey
A when the rice won't swell
Man belly nah go full
A when the rice won't swell
Man belly nah go full
The fire red hot
No water's there to out it
It a go be a bangarang (it's gonna be a bangarang)
In this hawk and patou race (it's gonna be a big race)
Some going too fast while some won't go (some won't go)
So in de final it a go bring a confusion
Then ev'ryone will see who a de Gorgon
An' ev'ryone will see who a de hero
For when the rice won't swell
Man belly nah go full
And when belly nah full
A ya-so it a go deyEmbed
