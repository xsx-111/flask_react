Hello Carol LyricsHello, Carol - I'm depending on you
Hello, Carol - I'm depending on you
I got a fever an' fresh cold so I'm depending on you
From my heart an' soul I'm depending on you
So much tears on my pillow
Like a flowing river
Uh-huh-huh (true true)
Uh-huh-huh (true true)
My mama forsake me
Then my daddy won't see me
Now I'm like a (true true)
A bachelor (true true)
With no relation
Hello, Carol - I'm depending on you
Hello, Carol - I'm depending on you...Embed
