Eli Eli LyricsEli, eli, eli - lama sabachthani?
Righteousness will soon begin to flow among i and i
Just you wait and see
'cause very soon man is going to realize
Best thing in life is when you are free
Free to walk among the dread, free to walk among the soul
The police men and the army
Forget what colour you may be
And begin to check de blood and you will find out that
We all are one brothers
We all are one sisters
We all are one blood, so
Let's talk about love and forget envity
If jah can forgive us then why can't we forgive one anotherEmbed
