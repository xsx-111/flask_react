Mix Up LyricsI-man don't like to get mix up (mix up, mix up)
By pushing me mouth in something I can't prove (no, no, no)
I-man don't take hearsay (hearsay)
Dem kind of things bring mix up (mix up, mix up)
I-man no say what next man say (next man say)
I like to prove things for I-self (for I-self)
So I take a walk from 6th street
Trying to prove something
Going to the bottom of 8th street
From corner to corner you can hear
Yes, the youths dem a shout
Natty dread, yes them dread
Natty dread, natty rule
Natty cool, (cool-cool natty dread)
Yes them dread
For they stand up in Babylon...Embed
