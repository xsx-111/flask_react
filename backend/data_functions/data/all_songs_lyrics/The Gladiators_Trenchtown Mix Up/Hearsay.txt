Hearsay LyricsSays I-man don't deal in no kind of hearsay
Back 'weh wi dat an' come straight if you a come
Say dem a de ginnal - dem a de big chief
But the winning card in dis game it's I who got it
Remember dis little sayin' that bush have ears
Pick sense out of nonsense, you'll get the answer
Bush don't have ears, my friend, but someone may be in it
Hearing what you have said about your brothers
Hearing what you have said about your sister
Hearing how you have made your own confession
Hearing what you have done in de pas'
'Cause ev'ry secret sin must reveal
So if you nuh know what a gwan
Keep your mouth shut an' don' say a word yaEmbed
