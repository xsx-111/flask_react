The Coast Lyrics
A family of musicians took shelter for the night
In the little harbor church of St. Cecilia
Two guitars, bata, bass drum and tambourine
Rose of Jericho and bougainvillea

This is a lonely life
Sorrows everywhere you turn
And that's worth something
When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money

A trip to the market
A trip into the pearl gray morning sunlight
That settles over washington
A trip to the market
A trip around the world
Where the evening meal
Is negotiable, if there is one

This is a lonely, lone, lonely life
Sorrows everywhere you turn
And that's worth something
When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money

To prove that I love you
Because I believe in you
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
And if I have money
If I have children
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Oo-wah oo-wah doo-wop a doo-wah
Summer skies, the stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Oo-wah oo-wah doo-wop a doo-wah
Summer skies, the stars are falling

We are standing in the sunlight
The early morning sunlight
In the harbor church of St. Cecilia
To praise a soul's returning to the earth
To the rose of Jericho and the bougainvillea

This is the only life
And that's worth something
When you think about it
That's worth some money
That's worth something
When you think about it
That is worth some money
To prove that I love you
Because I believe in you
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
And if I have money
If I have children
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
If I have weaknesses
Don't let them blind me now
Summer skies, stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Oo-wah oo-wah
Doo wop a doo wah
Summer skies, the stars are falling
Leaving the shadow of the valley behind me now
All along the injured coast

Ooh-wah oow-wah
Doo wop a doo wah
Summer skies and stars are falling
All along the injured coast
Ooh-wah ooh-wah
Doo wop a doo wahEmbed
