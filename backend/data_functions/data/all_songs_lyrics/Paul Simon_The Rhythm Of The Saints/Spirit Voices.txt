Spirit Voices LyricsWe sailed up a river wide as a sea
And slept on the banks on the leaves of a banyan tree
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
Some stories are magical, meant to be sung
Songs from the mouth of the river when the world was young
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
By moon we walk to the brujo's door
Along a path of river stones
Women with their nursing children seated on the floor
We join the fevers and the broken bones
The candlelight flickers, the falcon calls
A lime-green lizard scuttles down the cabin wall
And all of these spirit voices
Sing rainwater, sea water
River water, holy water
Wrap this child in mercy, heal her
Heaven's only daughter
All of these spirit voices rule the night
My hands were numb, my feet were lead
I drank a cup of herbal brew
Then the sweetness in the air combined with the lightness in my head
And I heard the jungle breathing in the bamboo
Saudações (Greetings!)
Dá licença um momento (excuse me, one moment)
Te lembro (I remind you)
Que amanhã (that tomorrow)
Será tudo ou será nada (it will be all or it will be nothing)
Depende, coração (it depends, heart)
Será breve ou será grande (it will be brief or it will be great)
Depende da paixão (it depends on the passion)
Será sujo, será sonho (it will be dirty, it will be a dream)
Cuidado, coração (be careful, heart)
Será útil, será tarde (it will be useful, it will be late)
Se esmera, coração (do your best, heart)
E confia (and have trust)
Na força do amanhã (in the power of tomorrow)
The lord of the earthquake, my trembling bed
The spider resumes the rhythm of its golden thread
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
And all of these spirit voices rule the night
And all of these spirit voices rule the nightEmbed
