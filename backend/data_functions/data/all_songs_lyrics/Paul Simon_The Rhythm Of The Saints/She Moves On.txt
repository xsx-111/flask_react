She Moves On LyricsI feel good, it's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts, the plane lifts
She moves on
Feel the bite whenever you believe
That you'll be lost and love will find you
When the road bends and the song ends
She moves on
I know the reason I feel so blessed
My heart still splashes inside my chest
But she, she is like a top, she cannot stop
She moves on
A sympathetic stranger
Lights a candle in the middle of the night
Her voice cracks, she jumps back
But she moves on
She says "ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discover"
The I fall to my knees
Shake a rattle at the skies
I'm afraid that I'll be taken
Abandoned, forsaken
In her cold coffee eyes
She can't sleep now, the moon is red
She fights a fever, she burns in bed
She needs to talk so we take a walk
Down in the maroon light
She says "maybe these emotions
Are as near to love as love will ever be"
So I agree
Then the moon breaks
She takes the corner that's all she takes
She moves on
She says "ooh my storybook lover
You have underestimated my power
As you shortly will discover"
Then I fall to my knees
I grow weak, I go slack
As if she captured the breath of my voice in a bottle
And I can't catch it back
But I feel good, it's a fine day
The way the sun hits off the runway
A cloud shifts, the plane lifts
She moves onEmbed
