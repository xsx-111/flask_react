Young Pilgrims Lyrics
A cold and wet November dawn
And there are no barking sparrows
Just emptiness to dwell upon
I fell into a winter slide
And ended up the kind of kid who goes down chutes too narrow
Just eking out my measly pipes

But I learned fast how to keep my head up, 'cause I
Know there this side of me that
Wants to grab the yoke from the pilot, and just
Fly the whole mess into the sea

Another slow train to the coast
Some brand new gory art from way on high
I sink and then I swim all night
I watch the ice melt on the glass
While the eloquent young pilgrims pass
And leave behind their trail
Imploring us all not to fail

Of course I was raised to gather courage from those
Lofty tales, so tried and true, and
If you're able I'd suggest it, 'cause this
Modern thought can get the best of you
This rather simple epitaph
Can save your hide, your fallen mind
Fate isn't what we're up against
There's no design, no flaw to find
There's no design, no flaw to find

But I learned fast, how to keep my head up, 'cause I
Know I got this side of me that
Wants to grab the yoke from the pilot, and just
Fly the whole mess into the sea5Embed
