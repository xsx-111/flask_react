Fighting in a Sack Lyrics
Just last night I woke from some unconscionable dream
Had it nailed to my forehead again
To keep this boat afloat
There are things you can't afford to know
So I save all my breath for the sails

But you'll find those lingering voices
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice and make a moron out of you
Walking a bridge on weakening cables
Huddled up in fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through

Most ideas turn to dust
As there are few in which we can all trust
Haven't you noticed I've been shedding all of mine?
So let's abandon that track
And leave our fathers fighting in a sack
Cause we're way too wiseassed for that

You might find some fools at your doorstep
Hustling the latest changes to the book that's the strangest
In an attempt to multiply
Marionettes on weakening cables
Huddled up with fear and hate because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through
We've taken on a climb
And it's long enough to put the best of us on our backs
Walking up a slide
And there are those we know who'd have us five miles off the track

You'll find those lingering voices
Are just your ego's attempt to make it all clean and nice and make a moron out of you
Crossing a bridge on weakening cables
Huddled up with fear and hate because we know our fate and it's a lot to put us through1Embed
