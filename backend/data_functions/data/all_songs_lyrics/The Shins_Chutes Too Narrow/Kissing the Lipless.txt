Kissing the Lipless Lyrics
Called to see
If your back was still aligned
And your sheets
Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed
But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves
It has too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard
The grey remains of a friendship scarred

You told us of your new life there
You got someone coming around
Gluing tinsel to your crown
He's got you talking pretty loud
You berate, remember
Your ailing heart and your criminal eyes
You say you're still in love
If it's true what can be done
It's hard to leave all those moments behind

Called to see
If your back was still aligned
And your sheets
Were growing grass all on the corners of your bed
But you've got too much to wear on your sleeves
It has too much to do with me
And secretly I want to bury in the yard
The grey remains of a friendship scarred
You tested your mettle
Of doe's skin and petals
While kissing the lipless
Who bleed all the sweetness away8Embed
