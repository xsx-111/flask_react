Saint Simon Lyrics
After all these implements and texts designed by intellects
So vexed to find, evidently there's still so much that hides
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient feeding lines
Their sentiment is just as hard to pluck from the vine

I'll try hard not to pretend
Allow myself no mock defense
Step into the night

Since I don't have time nor mind to figure out the nursery rhymes
That helped us out in making sense of our lives
The cruel, uneventful state of apathy releases me
I value them but I won't cry every time one's wiped out

I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
Step into the night

Mercy's eyes are blue
And when she places them in front of you
Nothing holds a Roman candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside
There's no measuring of
Nothing else is love
I'll try hard not to give in
Batten down to fare the wind
Rid my head of this pretense
Allow myself no mock defense
Step into the night

Mercy's eyes are blue
When she places them in front of you
Nothing really holds a candle to
The solemn warmth you feel inside you6Embed
