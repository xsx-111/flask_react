Those to Come Lyrics
Eyeless in the morning sun you were
Pale and mild, a modern girl
Taken with thought, still prone to care
Making tea in your underwear
You went out in the yard to find
Something to eat and clear your mind
Something bad inside me went away

Quaking leaves and broken light
Shifting skin, the coming night
The bearers of all good things arrive
Climb inside us, twist and cry
A kiss on your molten eyes
Myriad lives like blades of grass
Yet to be realized - bow as they pass

They are cold
Still
Waiting in the ether to
Form
Feel
Kill
Propagate
Only to die
They are cold
Still
Waiting in the ether to
Form
Feel
Kill
Propagate
Only to die
Dissolve
Magically, absurdly
They'll end
Leave
Dissipate coldly
And strangely
