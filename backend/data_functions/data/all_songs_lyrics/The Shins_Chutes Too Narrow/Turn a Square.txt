Turn a Square Lyrics
She shone up bright like a knife
Wearing tennis shorts made of stripes
Hand in hand to the grass and we got it right
Got it nice, nice, nice
Just a glimpse of an ankle and I
React like it's 1805
And I'd swim to the poles just to find the right satellite
It'll take all of my strength to give up

But you all know I tried
So forget about it, girl
My head's like a kite
When such a creature I sight

To town!
Where your feet leave no prints on the ground
Have I left my home just to whine in this microphone?
It gets worse every time that we talk
Can't afford to be just one in a flock
But that's your lot
When you're after such a well-made lock
Who was classically trained to give up
And my friends know I tried
So forget about it, girl
Even I don't know why
I can't just stay the course
Keep my hands on the wheel
Our detractors were right
My head's like a kite
'Cause all my thoughts run astray
And I'm a walking cliche
When such a creature I sight

I can't just stay the course
Keep my hands on the wheel
Our detractors were right
My head's like a kiteEmbed
