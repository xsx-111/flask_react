Uncomfortable LyricsMaybe you're uncomfortable
With the fact we're waking up
How do you turn hate to love?
How do you turn hate to love?
Maybe you're uncomfortable
With the fact we're waking up
Why do you keep shooting us?
Why do you keep shooting us?
Oh, the way that you judge me
This is madness
Oh, I'm praying, I'm hoping, believing
In God's magic
Oh, every day is dangerous for me
Internal sadness
Oh, I'm praying, I'm hoping, believing
In God's magic, oh, woah
Maybe you're uncomfortable
With the fact we're waking up (Oh)
Why do you keep shooting us?
How do you turn hate to love? (How do you turn)
Maybe you're uncomfortable (No, no)
With the fact wе're waking up (We're waking up)
Why do you keep shooting us? (Why?)
How do you turn hatе to love? (How do you turn)
Maybe you're uncomfortable (How do you turn)
With the fact we're waking up (Hate to love)
Why do you keep shooting us?
How do you turn hate to love?
Maybe you're uncomfortableEmbed
