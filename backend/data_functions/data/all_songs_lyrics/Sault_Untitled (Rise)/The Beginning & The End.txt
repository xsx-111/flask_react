The Beginning & The End LyricsWe will not let our minds be used
We will not let our minds be used in this wicked world
We will band together
We will make the human family one once more
We will live in a land teeming with prosperity
With purity, common good
With milk and honey
They say for unto us, a child is born, a son is given
But our child is missing, plastered onto every lamppost
And stop sign across America, no less, the world
In red, bold typeface, it reads "Kidnapped"
We shall reclaim our joy
We shall remuster our strength, through millеnnia
Bathed in the tears of a thousand ancеstors, we shall rise
As it was in the beginning, so too shall it be in the end
(It's time to go to war)
They don't know 'bout war, they don't know 'bout war
They don't really want us to go to war
Never ever, never, never ever
Never ever, never ever, never ever, never ever
They don't know 'bout war, they don't know 'bout war
Never, never, never ever
Ever, never ever, never, eh-nah, ah-nah
Ever, never ever, never, eh-nah, ah-nah
They don't really want us to go to war (Ever, never, never ever, never)
Never ever, never ever, never
Never, never ever, never, never, never ever
Never, never ever, never, never, never ever
They don't know 'bout war, they don't know 'bout war (Ever, never, eh-nah, ah-nah)
They say for unto us, a child is born, a son is given
But our child is missing, plastered onto every lamppost
And stop sign across America, no less, the world
In red, bold typeface, it reads "Kidnapped"
We shall reclaim our joy
We shall remuster our strength, through millennia
Bathed in the tears of a thousand ancestors, we shall rise
As it was in the beginning, so too shall it be in the endEmbed
