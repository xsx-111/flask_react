Street Fighter LyricsThey can't stop us
Nothing like us
It's not over
Till they hear us now
We gon' fight it whether you like it
Keep playing the music loud
God gonna let me down, no
He won't ever stop, no
We are survivors
We are the titans
We're united
We have real war scars
They're not gonna come and save us
We have to fight fearless
Sister, wipe your blood
They're not gonna conquer us
Feel the resistance
Feel my resistance
My rebel spirit and guidance
You have no chance
You took a life
You have to pay the price
Disturb, put up your fist and stand up
And scream out until they hear us
Street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
We gon' fight it whether you like it
Keep playing the music loud
God gonna let me down, no
He won't ever stop, no
We are survivors
We are the titans
We're united
We have real war scars
They're not gonna come and save us
We have to fight fearless
Sister, wipe your blood
They're not gonna conquer us
Feel the resistance
Feel my resistance
My rebel spirit and guidance
You have no chance
You took a life
You have to pay the price
Disturb, put up your fist and stand up
And scream out until they hear us
Street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighter
Street fighter, street fighterEmbed
