No Black Violins In London LyricsMan, I ain't scared
Never in my doggone life have I ever ran from a fight
And I ain't running now
What you say? That's what I thought
Tryna call the police on somebody for eating ice cream
Going to the park
Hanging out
Graduating
Looking at me sideways
Is you out your mind? Or is you crazy?
You better put your money on another pony, Jack, 'cause I ain't the one
I will let you know 'bout yourself and I will embarrass you
In front of God
And everybody
Now what? What you gon' do?Embed
