I Just Want To Dance LyricsI just wanna dance (I just wanna dance)
Dance, dance, dance
Makes me feel alive (Makes me feel alive)
Feel alive
I get kind of mad (I get kind of mad)
Mad, mad, mad
We lost another life (Lost another life)
Life, life, life
I just wanna dance (I just wanna dance)
Dance, dance, dance (Just wanna dance)
Makes me feel alive (Makes me feel alive)
Feel alive (Feel alive)
I get kind of mad (I get kind of mad)
Mad, mad, mad (Get kind of mad)
We lost another life (Lost another life)
Life, life, life (Lost another)
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Boom, bap, boom-ba-doom-bap
Got to find a way out
I'm sick of hearing lies, lies
Got to find a way out
Why my people always die?
People have died
Got to find a way out
Got to find a way out
Why do they kill all the time, time, time, time?
Rise again, rise again, rise again
I just wanna dance
Dance, dance, dance
Makes me feel alive
Feel alive
I get kind of mad
Mad, mad, mad
We lost another life
Life, life, life
I just wanna dance (I just wanna dance)
Dance, dance, dance
Makes me feel alive (Makes me feel alive)
Feel alive
I get kind of mad (I get kind of mad)
Mad, mad, mad
We lost another life (Lost another life)
Life, life, life
You won't see me cry
No, no, no
You won't see me cry
No, no, no
You won't see me cry
No, no, no
You won't see me cry
No, no, no
Can I do the same thing again?
I just wanna danceEmbed
