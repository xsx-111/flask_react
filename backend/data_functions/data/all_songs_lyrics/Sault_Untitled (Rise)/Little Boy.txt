Little Boy LyricsLittle boy, little boy, when you get older
You can ask me all the questions
And I'll tell you the truth about the boys in blue

And you're searching for the answers
And the lost truth for those who look like you

You can ask me all the questions
And I'll tell you the truth about the boys in blue
Little boy, little boy, when you get older
And you're sеarching for the answers
