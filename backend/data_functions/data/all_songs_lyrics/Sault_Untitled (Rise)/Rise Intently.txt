Rise Intently LyricsWe ain't playing no more (Nope)
Can't take my money no more (Nope)
Made my brother choke (Choke)
This here ain't no joke (Nope)
Can't look me in my eyes (Nope)
They ain't saving lives
Black woman, black woman angry
Black man, black man angry
Black woman, black woman angry
Black man, black man angry
Hope this pain don't change me
In your eyes, you hate me
Use your laws to break me
Black don't crack, you crazy
We will rise intently
We will rise intently
We will rise intently
We will rise intently
We will rise intently
We will rise intently
We will rise intently
We will rise intently
We will rise intently
We will rise intentlyEmbed
