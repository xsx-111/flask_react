Fearless Lyrics'Cause we are fearless
'Cause we are fearless
Hard to smile, I know you're feeling
And it hurts on the inside, hope
'Cause we are fearless
'Cause we are fearless
'Cause we are fearless
All our lives (All our lives)
Simply feels like we've been trying to go back (Go back)
To Africa
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't really wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't really wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't really wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't rеally wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't really wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't rеally wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't really wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't really wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
I don't really wanna feel I'm
I don't really wanna feel I'm 'bout to cry
Just live your life, don't ever stop for nothing
You know, you, you can do anything you want to
Be yourself at all times, don't be afraid of nothing, nobody
Be fearless
It is all in your mind, your mind, your mindEmbed
