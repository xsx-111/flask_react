Hearing gunshots in the streets every night
Yeah, we looking for a way out the problem
Every time I see police, heavy cries
These are, these are, these are scary times
Hear us screaming out "thief," you took a life
Another one's gone, a lost soul
That's why we're marching in the streets every night
These are, these are, thesе are scary times
Thesе are, these are, these are scary times
These are, these are, these are scary times
Are you scared of your life? You running every night
You just gotta hold on brother
Don't lose yourself, don't let them make you lose yourself
You know?
Don't let nothing, no oneEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
