Free LyricsDon't need a hero anyway
Although I really like your style
Don't need a hero anyway
Even though you changed my mind
'Cause I needed you yesterday
But again, you weren't around
Don't need a hero anyway
Although I really like your style
Don't need a hero anyway
Even though you changed my mind
'Cause I needed you yesterday
But again, you weren't around
Don't need a hero anyway
Even though you changed my mind
Free
Don't give up for no one
'Cause God's love is free
The silver lining fall
What will be will be
And we may feel alone
Free
Don't need a hero anyway
Although I really like your stylе
Don't need a hero anyway
Even though you changed my mind
'Causе I needed you yesterday
But again, you weren't around
'Cause I needed you yesterday
But again, you weren't around
Don't need an egomaniac
In my life to drive me wild
I had to run away from that
Don't mess with Heaven's child
Now you see that I'm on my way
Wanna drag me down, oh why?
Don't need an ego anyway
Don't need an ego anyway
“I know you ain't come this far
Just to go back to where you came from”
Free
Don't give up for no one
'Cause God's love is free
The silver lining fall
What will be will be
And we may feel alone
You're free
Don't give up for no one
'Cause God's love is free
The silver lining fall
What will be will be
And we may feel alone
You're free
I know
I can make it on my own
When I'm low
I try hard to keep you close
I know, oh
I can make it on my own
When I'm low
I try hard to keep you close
I know
I can make it on my own
When I'm low
I try hard to keep you close
I know
I can make it on my own
When I'm low
I try hard to keep you close
I know
I can make it on my own
When I'm low
I try hard to keep you close1Embed
