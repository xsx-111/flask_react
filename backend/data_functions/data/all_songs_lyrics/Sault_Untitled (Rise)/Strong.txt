Strong LyricsGot to stay, even when they're (Wrong)
Got to stay, even when they're (Wrong)
Got to stay strong, even when they're (Wrong)
Got to stay, even when they're
We're moving forward tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We won't back down tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
(Wrong)
Got to stay, even when they're (Wrong)
Got to stay, even when they're (Wrong)
Got to stay strong, even when they're (Wrong)
Got to stay strong, even when they'rе (Wrong)
Got to stay, got to stay (Got to stay strong)
I got to stay, got to stay strong (Even when they'rе (Wrong))
Got to stay, got to stay (Got to stay strong)
I got to stay, got to stay strong (Even when they're (Wrong))
Got to stay, got to stay (Got to stay strong)
I got to stay, got to stay strong (Even when they're (Wrong))
Got to stay, got to stay (Got to stay strong)
I got to stay, got to stay strong (Even when they're)
Worship the skin I'm in 'cause I love my colour
Gotta fight, gotta fight
Nobody wants to admit that we are the chosen
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We're moving forward tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We won't back down tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
Laughter heals all that's torn
I've got to say, I've got to say
That laughter heals the pain away
Even though you're numb, you're not on your own
I can wait, no, I can wait (Yeah, yeah)
I've got to fight another day
See, they thought they could hide your truth
They were wrong
We're moving forward tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We won't back down tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We're moving forward tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
Don't look away, don't look away
Don't, don't look away, don't look away
We're moving forward tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We won't back down tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We're moving forward tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We won't back down tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We're moving forward tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We won't back down tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We're moving forward tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight
We won't back down tonight
Gotta fight, gotta fight1Embed
