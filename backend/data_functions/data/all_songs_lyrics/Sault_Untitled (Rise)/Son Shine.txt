Son Shine LyricsLet the son shine, shine on me
I think that God's crying when it rains
Let the son shine, through my pain
Son, we will rise
You know that one day things have to change (Change)
The missing piece (The missing piece)
A long way (A long way)
Your love's protecting me
Your love's protecting me
Your love's protecting me
Your love's protecting me
Your love's protecting me
You're always there when I need
Let the son shinе, shine on me
(Peoplе of the son, you're the chosen one)
Let the son shine, shine on me
(People of the son, you're the chosen one)
I think that God's crying when it rains
Let the son shine through my pain
Son, we will riseEmbed
