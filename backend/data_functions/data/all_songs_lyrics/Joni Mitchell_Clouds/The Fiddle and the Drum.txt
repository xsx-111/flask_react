The Fiddle and the Drum Lyrics
And so once again, my dear Johnny, my dear friend
And so once again you are fightin' us all
And when I ask you why, you raise your sticks and cry and I fall
Oh, my friend, how did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum?

You say I have turned like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember all the good things you are
And so I ask you please, can I help you find the peace and the star?
Oh, my friend, what time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist?

And so once again, oh, America my friend
And so once again you are fighting us all
And when we ask you why, you raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh, my friend, how did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum?

You say we have turned like the enemies you've earned
But we can remember all the good things you are
And so we ask you please, can we help you find the peace and the star
Oh my friend, we have all come
To fear the beating of your drumEmbed
