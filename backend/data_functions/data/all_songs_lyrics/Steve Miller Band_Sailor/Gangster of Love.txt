Gangster of Love Lyrics
There's Frank James and Jesse James
Billy Kid and all the rest
Supposed to be some bad cats
Way out in the West
If those cats could have dug me
And my gangster ways
They would have hung up their guns
And dug into their graves

'Cause I'm a gangster
A gangster of love
I'm a gangster
A gangster of love
Now look here
When I go into a bar
Girls from near and far
Say I'm a gangster
A gangster of love

I jumped in my white horse Cadillac
I rode across the border line
I roped 55 girls
I kissed them all at the same time
Took 25 or 30, put 'em all on a freight
There was a million dollar reward for me in each and every state
Sheriff says, "Is your name Stevie "Guitar" Miller?" in a very deep voice
And I said, "Yes sir, brother sheriff, and that's your wife on the back of my horse"

I can't help it
I'm a gangster
I can't help it
You know, I'm a gangster
I'm a gangsterEmbed
