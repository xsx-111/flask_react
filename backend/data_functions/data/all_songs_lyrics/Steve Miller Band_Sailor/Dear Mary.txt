Dear Mary LyricsDear Mary
Thank you for the day
We shared together
Had there been another day
Another way to tell you I need you, I need you
Had there been another day
Dear Mary
Thank you for the day
We shared together
Deep in my heart I am waiting
I'm waiting for you
Deep in my heart I am waiting
What else can I do
Waiting, waiting for youEmbed
