Living in the U.S.A. Lyrics
Stand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back

Doot do do do do doot doot
Living in the U.S.A
Doot do do do do doot doot
Living in the U.S.A

Where are you goin' to
What are you gonna do
Do you think that it will be easy
Do you think that it will be pleasin', hey
Stand back, what'd you say
Stand back, I won't pay
Stand back, I'd rather play
Stand back
It's my freedom
Ah, don't worry 'bout me, babe
I got to be free, babe
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
Doot do do do do doot doot
Living in the U.S.A
Doot do do do do doot doot
Living in the U.S.A

Stand back, dietician
Stand back, television
Stand back, politician
Stand back, mortician
Oh, we got to get away
Living in the U.S.A
Come on, baby, owwww

I see a yellow man, a brown man
A white man, a red man
Lookin' for Uncle Sam
To give you a helpin' hand
But everybody's kickin' sand
Even politicians
We're living in a plastic land
Somebody give me a hand, yeah
Oh, we're gonna make it, baby
Oh, we're going to shake it, baby
Oh, don't break it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, baby, hey
Hey, hey
In the U.S.A., babe, yeah

Doot do do do do doot doot
Living in the U.S.A
Don't worry 'bout me, babe
Doot do do do do doot doot
Living in the U.S.A
Living in the U.S.A

Doot do do do do doot doot
Living in the U.S.A
I got to be free
Doot do do do do doot doot
Living in the U.S.A

Come on, try it, you can buy it, you can leave it next week, yeah
Somebody gimme a cheeseburger, oh
Come on, babe
Oh yeah, hey, heyEmbed
