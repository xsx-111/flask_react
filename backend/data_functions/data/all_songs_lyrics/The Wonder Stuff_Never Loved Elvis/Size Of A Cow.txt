Size Of A Cow LyricsDon't you think it's funny that nothing's what it seems
When you're not looking forward?
Me, I'd like to think life is like a drink
And I'm hoping that it tastes like bourbon
You know that I've been drunk a thousand times
And these should be the best days of my life
Life, it's not what I thought it was
Damn blast, look at my past
I'm ripping up my feet over broken glass
I said, Oh wow, look at me now
I'm building up my problems to the size of a cow
The size of a cow
You know it would be strange to live life in a cage
And only believe the things you see that are written on the page
How easy would it be to be home in time for tea
And stop feeling like a sailboat rocking on the sea
You know that it's been sunk a thousand times
And these should be the best days of my life
Life, it's not what I thought it was
Damn blast, look at my past
I'm ripping up my feet over broken glass
I said, Oh wow, look at me now
I'm building up my problems to the size of a cow
The size of a cow
The size of a cow
You know that I've been drunk a thousand times
And these should be the best days of my life
Life, it's not what I thought it was
Damn blast, look at my past
I'm ripping up my feet over broken glass
I said, Oh wow, look at me now
I'm building up my problems to the size of a cow
Damn blast, look at my past
I'm ripping up my feet over broken glass
I said, Oh wow, look at me now
I'm building up my problems to the size of a cow
The size of a cowEmbed
