Here Comes Everyone LyricsThere is no us, there is only I
Dropped like a tear from my mother's eye
Mother do you know your son at all?
Looking for the things he'll never ind
Talks too much about suicide
Who can tell what's on his mind?
Here comes everyone
Live fast, die young
Leave a good looking corpse
I'm only joking of course
I'm gonna ride out of here on a big white horse
Like some poetic whore
Here comes everyone
Could you love him?
Would he love you?
Here comes everyoneEmbed
