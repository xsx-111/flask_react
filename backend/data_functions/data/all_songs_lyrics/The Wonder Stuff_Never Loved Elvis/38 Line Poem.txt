38 Line Poem Lyrics
When I lay night
You know I feel alright
And there's a reason why
And my reason's why
I feel so high
I've got the flying five

'Cause they're just like everybody else
Yeah, they're just like everybody else
Said, they're just like everybody else
Yeah, they're just like everybody else


And, no, I wouldn't sing
Just to gather hoards
'Cause that would only bore
And my reason's why
I'm with the flying five
They're worth so much more

'Cause they're just like everybody else
Yeah, they're just like everybody else
Said, they're just like everybody else
Well, they're just like everybody else

And, no, they didn't come
Just to sing ya pop
Or to join the rot
And, no, they didn't come
To hear the words, "Forget-me-not"

'Cause they're just like everybody else
Yeah, they're just like everybody else
Said, they're just like everybody else
Yeah, they're just like everybody else
Said, they're just like everybody else
Yeah, they're just like everybody else
You're just like everybody else
Oh, they're just like everybody else
And they're just like everybody else
Oh, they're just like everybody else
Oh, they're just like everybody elseEmbed
