Grotesque Lyrics
Since I've been seeing you
Well, there's a lot more things that I should do
Since I've known your name
I've been so lazy I should be ashamed
And you should see my place
It's been a mess since I saw your face
I don't know how or why you came
I don't know shit, don't even know my name
I lost my name

You don't ask me for much
But I'm losing track of half my stuff
Things go without a trace
And your best friend tells me you've got a new place
Well, I bet it looks just fine
More than half the things you've got are mine
And I should break your neck
'Cause I'm losing track and I'm losing my self respect
My self respect


Now I'm feeling mad
For the love of the things that I used to have
Yeah, now I'm feeling bad
For the love of a girl, but she's driving me mad
And all her friends look smug
It's catching on like a virus bug
She's got some poor mug
And she'll get him down and she'll do it again
She'll do it all again
She'll do it all again
She'll do it all again-gain-gain, yeah, ohEmbed
