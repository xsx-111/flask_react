Caught In My Shadow LyricsCaught in My Shadow
Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow
These streets used to look pretty
This town used to look like a city
These people used to talk to me
(x2)
But now I'm Caught in My Shadow
Oh, Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow
Offer me the bait and I'd take it
Offer me the cake and I'd bake it
Usually I'd try to fake it
But these days I'd rather face it
(x2)
Caught in My Shadow
Oh, Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow
If it's not enough I gave my blood
My sweat, my tears, and all I said I would
(x2)
Oh
Oh, Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow
Yeah, I'm Caught in My Shadow
I'm Caught in My Shadow
Just leaves me behind
I'm Caught in My Shadow
Just leading the blindEmbed
