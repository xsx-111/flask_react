Play LyricsPlay, I only ever saw it as play
I didn't think that's what they'd say
No, I never wanna hear that again
I used to have paper and pen
I'd write it down time and again
And I'm never gonna do that again
All those thigns I said
I only said them in jest
(my God what a mess)
I said all of those things to you
And now there's very little left
And I'm never gonna do that again
Rain, I hate getting caught in the rain
I hope it doesn't happen again
No, I never wanna get caught again
I used to think drinking brought shame
But a bottle of wine I would drain
Yeah, I bet I'm gonna do that againEmbed
