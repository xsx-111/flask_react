Inertia LyricsOhh, where does river end?
Aah, where does journey find friend?
Ohh, where does river end?
It just keeps on moving
No, it's not a boy's name
No, it's not a girl's name
Inertia, I'd call my child all the same
So (s)he'd keep on moving
Don't let your feet stick to the ground
When everyone else is moving all around
Don't be stationary or laden down
Just keep on moving
Don't try to tell me that your feet are made of lead
Two choices, hang back or get ahead
Lead the pack, get it in your head to
Keep on moving
Ooh, inertiaEmbed
