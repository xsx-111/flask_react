Maybe Lyrics
Maybe I should be a writer
Write a book and feel much brighter
And share my thoughts with the world
Or maybe then, I could be a filmmaker
Celluloid is more fun than paper
You never see the screen's corners curl
Or maybe then, I could be a lover
Find a girl and win her over
And tell her that she's the only one
But, yeah, maybe then, a philanderer
I'd sneak around and lie to her
And kid myself that I'm the happy one

I'm not looking over four-leaf clovers
I'm just waiting for Hell to freeze over, yeah, over

Maybe I should take the mic
Stand up tall like Michael Stipe
And try to solve the problems of the earth
Or maybe then, I should sit back down
Scratch my chin and use my frown
And try to figure out exactly what I'm worth
We're still building churches, burning books
Killing the babies to feed the crooks
Who said the world would turn out fair?
So I guess I'll dig myself a hole
Ask the devil if he wants my soul
And do something real like cut my hair
I'm not looking over four-leaf clovers
I'm just waiting for Hell to freeze over, yeah, over
Yeah, woo


Oh, maybe this or maybe that
It may be satin, it may be sack
It won't really matter much in the end
May be my enemy, may be my friend
I'd drive myself around the bend
Thanks for your time and ears to lend

I'm not looking over four-leaf clovers
I'm just waiting for Hell to freeze over
No, no, I'm not looking over four-leaf clovers
I'm just waiting for Hell to freeze over, yeah, overEmbed
