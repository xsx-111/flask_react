Mission Drive LyricsMy mission drive is to open up my eyes
And I don't care who wants to stare these days
To realize, to be brought back down to size
The wicked lies and all the shite you say
I don't care who wants to stare these days
Yeah, my mission drive is to open up my eyes
Cut the wicked lies and all the shite you say
I'm not losing my mind
No I'm not changing my lines
I'm just learning new things with the passage of time
I'm looking on the bright side
I wear it like a bruise
I've never loved Elvis
And I've never sung the Blues
I'm thinking of another man
I remind myself of him
I wear it like a hairstyle
Or a stain upon my skin
But my flesh is getting cleaner
And my hair is growing thin
Hup!
Yeah, my mission drive is to open up my eyes
Cut the wicked lies and all the shite you say
You say . Oh!
No, no, no, no
You say, you say, ay, ay, ayEmbed
