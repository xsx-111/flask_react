Willing to Wait LyricsWhen you see him again, tell him everything that you told me
Tell him that I'm still your friend
And maybe you would like to see me again
I'm willing to wait my turn to be with you
But I still have a lot to learn about me
And no one's sure if we should be together
But oh, when I saw you again
A beautiful friend, she opened up her heart and let me in
No, I cannot lie to you
I'm still in love with you and I only wanna be with you
So when you see him again, tell him everything that you told me
We're more than friends
And maybe we should start again
Maybe you could love me again
Cause oh, when I saw you again
A beautiful friend, she opened up her heart and let me in
No, I cannot lie to you
I'm still in love with you and i only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with youEmbed
