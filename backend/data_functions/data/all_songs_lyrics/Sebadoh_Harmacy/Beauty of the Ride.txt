Beauty of the Ride LyricsNever did and never will
It’s just the way it’s always been
I’ve made mistakes before
I’ll make the same again
And all this tension we ignore
Surely works its ugly way inside
I have known that nothing’s fair
Surely what did I expect?
When magic slips into the air
And every day’s another test
And all this tension we ignore
It surely works its ugly way outside
So let it build, let it explode
Leaving blood and shattered bone
Or bite your tongue
Till you’ve forgotten what to say
And take another step back
Until you find you’ve walked away
Silence like disease
But I dare not say it hurts
‘Cause if I honestly react
Nothing’s ever going to work
And all this tension back and forth
It’s just the beauty of the ride
It’s just the beauty of the ride
So let it build, let it explode
Leaving blood and shattered bone
Or bite your tongue
Till you’ve forgotten what to say
And take another step back
Until you find you’ve walked awayEmbed
