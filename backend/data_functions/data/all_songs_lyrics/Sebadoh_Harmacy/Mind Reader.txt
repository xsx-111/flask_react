Mind Reader LyricsLook, baby, I'm not a mind reader
You're going to have to tell me so
You're looking down at your shoes again
Take us down off of a cloud
Riding high in the sky
You'd have to tell me so
Look, baby, I aren't extrasensory
You can't reach me with your new telepathy
It's raining down all your blues again
Take us down off of a cloud
I'm riding high in the sky
You'd have to tell me so
I'm not a mind reader
I'm not a mind reader
I'm not a mind reader
I'm not a mind readerEmbed
