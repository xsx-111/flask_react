Nothing Like You LyricsIf I'm right, sometimes I forget I might
Shallow as the brook out back
Bedtime stories that you can't take back
Figure how to be a friend to you
God knows I want to
There's a lot of girls in the world
That are nothing like you
There's no need to condescend
Not knowing, careful to pretend
Give away your fucked-up friends
Tired news and damaged trends
Figure how to be a friend to you
God knows I want to
There's a lot of girls in the world
That are nothing like you
If we play your games
Won't have time to play my games
Forget how to be myself
But now I've got it figured out
They're nothing like you
They're nothing like you
They're nothing like you
They're nothing like youEmbed
