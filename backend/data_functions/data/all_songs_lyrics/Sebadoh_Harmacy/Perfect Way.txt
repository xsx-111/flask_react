Perfect Way LyricsAnkle-deep in your personal concerns
Love it or leave it, it's all the same
Find that perfect way to keep you happy
Change the past if you can find it
Get someone to help you out
Find that perfect way to keep you angry
The point that's pointed dull
The edge that doesn't cut anymore
Halfway up that wall
But there's another right around the corner
Drive a wedge, put your weight behind it
Get someone to help you out
Find that perfect way to keep you busy
The point that's pointed dull
The edge that doesn't cut anymore
Halfway up that wall
But there's another right around the corner
You've got anger in your eyes, I don't buy it
And if you're holding I'll shake you down
Share that perfect way to keep me happy
Share that perfect way to keep me happyEmbed
