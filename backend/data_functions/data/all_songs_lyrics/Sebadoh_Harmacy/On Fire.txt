On Fire Lyrics
My opinion could change today
I’m responsible anyway
For second to third hand information
That complicates the complication
And I don’t think before I speak
And I don’t know how far my words reach
So wrong nearly every time
That I’m sorry, I speak my mind
If what I said was unkind

And now it feels like I’m on fire
And it’s burning the world through
Don’t hold it against me
‘Cause I know you’re lying, too

Is there any need for apology?
There’s no reason to believe me
Judgments born in my jealous mind
Creeping inside, outside
Connections I’ve made never follow through
And sooner or later disappoint you
Or cross you twice when your back is turned
That’s how, I’ve learned
That someone has got to be burned
And now it feels like I’m on fire
These words are not the truth
But don’t hold it against me
‘Cause I know you’re lying, too

Feels like I’m on fire
It’s burning the world through
Don’t let me fall without someone to hold on to
Someone to hold on to
Someone to hold on toEmbed
