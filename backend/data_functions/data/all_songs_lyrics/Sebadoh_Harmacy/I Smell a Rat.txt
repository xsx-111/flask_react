I Smell a Rat LyricsFive years wading in the pool
With more rules than a Sunday school
Woke up, took a shower
Now I've got soul power
I smell a rat
I smell a rat
I know I smell a rat, baby
Got a ride on the midnight train
To the beauty of the brain
I got drunk, on love
Got stuck in the mud
I smell a rat
I smell a rat
I know I smell a rat, baby
I smell a rat
I smell a rat
Plant the garden on the wall
Paint the ceiling on the floor
Sit back, relax, breathe deep
I smell a rat 
I smell a rat, rat, rat, ratEmbed
