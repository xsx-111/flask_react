Open Ended LyricsHere is an open-ended threat, subject to interpretation
But I do not want to fight just yet, I wanted to see what would happen
And maybe I do not know my place, still thinking like a child
Only trying to shake this shadow, squinting through a broken window
Know who deserves it, who got there first
Who lied about it and made things worse
See, it don't matter I've only begun to confuse you
It's what I do
Here is an open-ended threat to tip the balance we've been riding
With all this talk of honesty, I look and see who is really hiding
Know who deserves it, who got there first
Who lied about it and made things worse
See, it don't matter I've only begun to confuse you
It's what I do
You deserve it, you got there first
I didn't make it and that still hurts
I could be floating or ready to explode
If I do not show, no one knowsEmbed
