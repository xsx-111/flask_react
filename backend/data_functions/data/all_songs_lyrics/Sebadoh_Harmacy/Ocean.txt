Ocean Lyrics
So you think you’re in the middle of the ocean
Stranded on an island of your own
Or stuck in the top of a mountain
Either way you’re going to say you’re all alone

And I hesitate to say that you’re a liar
I never tell the truth myself
But I tried to chase you down and I got tired
So I’m leaving you to be with someone else

‘Cause you never want to hook up in the middle
And I’d meet you there to talk if you would show
But you answer every question with a riddle
And refuse to even choose to let me go

It used to be I’d tell you all my secrets
Giving you the credit you deserve
I guess you didn’t care to lose or keep it
And we never quite connected from the first

And I wish I had a way to make it better
To rearrange the world and make you smile
But it’s dumb to even think I had that power
And we haven’t been that close in a while
And I don’t even want to try to name it
Explain it for the one who couldn’t care
‘Cause all that matters is the way you choose to frame it

And I hesitate to say that you’re a liar
I never tell the truth myself
But I tried to chase you down and I got tired
So I’m leaving you to you or someone else

‘Cause you never want to hook up in the middle
And I’d meet you there to talk if you would show
But you answer every question with a riddle
And refuse to even choose to let me goEmbed
