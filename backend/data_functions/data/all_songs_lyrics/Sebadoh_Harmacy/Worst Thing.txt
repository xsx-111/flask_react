Worst Thing Lyrics
I’ll have to think about it
It’s what she said to me
I’ll have to think about it
All the time in the world to be
When I sleep I dream about it
I chew it when I eat
After something I can’t explain
The court’s adjourned in the big debate

The way you are
That’s the worst thing you could do
Don’t you know that’s the worst thing?

Fantasy land, come dig my art
I’m just rehearsing
I’ll have to think about it
It’s what she said to me
When you leave behind all the guts it takes
Who will you be?
