Crystal Gypsy Lyrics
Fatal missy, daring you to kiss me
Crystal gypsy, light my fire

Tonight I die to realize
I bury my shit deep inside
I suck up all you think and I'm thirsty
Convoluted hell run dry


When it starts to suck and I'm stuck here
Carrying me far away
I just send a wink to the trustee
Check's in the mail, it's time to pay

Freeze out, I squeeze out something
To stumble out, stumble down
It's my kind of highway really
Convoluted hell run dryEmbed
