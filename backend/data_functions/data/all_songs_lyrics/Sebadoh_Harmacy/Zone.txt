Save the sermonette, there’s no one home
I ascend to make amends I think I know
I was begging the police to let you go
But I can’t stop the clock
Passed out to take in, let the unconcern begin

Volunteer your beer to the blue sky

At your hotel, an infidel with ESP, a blind man
Out of my mind, half of the time abused
All the patients are amused
