Sweet Danger LyricsThere is danger in my loving you
Danger in your letting me
Danger in your not instantly
Abandoning and forgetting me
Sweet danger, sweet danger
One we know we can share
Unbounded beauty, if we dare
We were destined for divided paths
Fated to be far apart
And there's danger in defying fate
With two foolish hearts
Sweet danger, sweet danger
And although we can share
Come open with your kiss
Our joy to secretness
And though there's danger waiting there
We'll be in love and we won't careEmbed
