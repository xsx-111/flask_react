Chicago LyricsI got the surprise, the surprise of my life
I had to stop and stare
I saw man dancing with his own wife
And you'll never guess where...
Chicago, Chicago--that toddlin' town, that toddlin' town
Chicago, Chicago--I'll show you around--I love it
Betcha bottom dollar you'll lose your blues
In Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down
On State Street, that great street
I just want to stay, I just want to stay
They do things they don't do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man who danced with his wife
In Chicago...Chicago...Chicago, Chicago
Free and easy town, brassy, breezy town
Chicago...Chicago
Let me cool my heels right down at Marshall Field
Come and walk with
Along the lake, to the drake
Hollar and whoop, all through the loop
Shout how now to Mrs. O'Leary's cow
No she-she, life is peachy
Chicago...we'll meet at the pump-room Ambassador East
To say the least
On shishkabob and breast of squab we will feast and get fleeced
Don't tell me sin is rampant and rife
Think of that man who danced with his wife
In Chicago...Chicago...
I'm in a shindy for that wonderful, windy town!Embed
