Come Rain or Come Shine LyricsI'm gonna love you like no-body's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever buck me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me
Your gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together
Un-happy together
Won't that be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
Were in or were out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you come rain or come shine
I love you as deep as a river come rain or come shine
I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you I'm gonna love you
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
One of those cra-zy things
But don't, don't, no, don't you ever buck me
Don't you buck me
Cause I'm gonna be true, gonna be true if you let me
Let me, let me
Let me, let me let me love you
Let me love you come rain or come shine
Happy together
Unhappy together won't that be fine
Days may be cloudy or sunny
Were in or were out of the money
But I'm with you baby
I'm with you baby
I'm with you always
Come rain or shineEmbed
