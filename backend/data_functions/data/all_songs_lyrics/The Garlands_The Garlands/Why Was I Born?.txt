Why Was I Born? LyricsWhy was I born, why am I living?
What do I get, what am I giving?
Why do I want the things, I daren't hope for?
What can I hope for? I wish I knew
Why do I try to draw you near me?
Why do I cry, you never hear me
I'm a poor fool but what can I do?
Why was I born to love you?
Why do I try to draw you near me?
Why do I cry, you never hear me
I'm a poor fool but what can I do?
Why was I born to love you?Embed
