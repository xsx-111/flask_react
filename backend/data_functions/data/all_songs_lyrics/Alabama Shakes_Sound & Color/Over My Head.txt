Over My Head Lyrics
I'm in over my head
I don't think of you as bits and pieces
I think of you only like a miracle
Lovin' so deeply
I feel it through all my past lives
It feels good, I'm never saying goodbye
It feels good, I'm never saying goodbye

I'm in over my head, over my head
I'm in over my head, over my head

Signs, they explain it to me
There's no joy I can take
With knowing what's waiting
Here for now, but not for long
Where do my mind slip away?
Explain that to me
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head
Loving so deeply, I'm in over my head8Embed
