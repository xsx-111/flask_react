Gemini Lyrics
On a planet not so far away
We were born together
In the beginning, there was just you and me
Where we was washed up, upon this river
Suckled on the honey of the Tennessee
Where we would sleep in the soft sunshine
I smile at you and you to me
And in the dark, I see the moon
Shine in your eyes
We grew strong and tall as weeds
Never live forever, there were no such thing
I looked at you, and you looked into me
And we saw in each other, everything
We knew no fear, as we grew the years
That's the growing up
We've come to love

On this planet not so far away
We wouldn't stay together
Rolling in a dream
We'd drift apart, on down the stream
Like honeysuckle tangled up in kudzu vine
The snake that lay in the sun, so fine
I saw true you, and you, true me
And in your eyes
I'd see the dark inside of you
Woke from dream
Pulled up like weed
Never knew no better, there were no such thing
I reached for you, like a child that cling
Oh, how we saw in each other, everything
Everything
