Dunes Lyrics
Somewhere over the dunes, love
I walked, I wept
Enough
I turned the desert into seabed
I swam from the terrible depths

I don't know whose problem it is
I don't know whose love to give

I'm losing it

Somewhere in me
Are memories
That I cannot gather, anymore
Oh, my word
Is on my mind
Quiet and empty

Oh, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I don't know what to do about it
Well, I'm not so sure about it


I don't know whose problem it is
I don't know whose fuck to give

I'm losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it
Losing it4Embed
