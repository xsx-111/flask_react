The Greatest Lyrics
Check - check this out
And a-five, six, seven, eight

Well, I never meant to be the greatest
I only ever want to be your baby
Life is perfect in your arms
Don't ever let me go
To go anywhere

Should I stay, stay away?
I know you ain't out there tryin' to be my baby
God, help us, help us all
Don't ever let me down
You're always doing that

God, dang

Should I stay, stay awake?
I know you ain't out there tryin' to be my baby
Life is perfect in your soul
Don't ever let me go
I could be your one and only
Well, I never meant to be the greatest
I know you ain't out there tryin' to be my baby
Come on, love me, come on
God, bring his ass on home
If you could do anything2Embed
