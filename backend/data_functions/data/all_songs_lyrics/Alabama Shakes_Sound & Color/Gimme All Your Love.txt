Gimme All Your Love Lyrics
So much is going on
But you can always come around
Why don't you sit with me, for just a little while?
Tell me, what's wrong?

If you'd just give me all your love
Gimme all you got, baby
Gimme all your love
Stick 'em up

So, tell me what you wanna do
You say, the world, it doesn't fit with you
Why don't you talk to me, for just a little while?
I can only try to make it right

If you'd just give me all your love
Gimme all you got, babe
Gimme all your love


Gimme all your love
Gimme all you got, baby
Just gimme all your love17Embed
