Shoegaze Lyrics
Can't wait for night to come
That's when the fun really begins
My band cools off when that day is done
And then I tuck myself in

It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not too lonely
And I begin to realize, hey
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?

Let's go make memories
Precious and temporary
Of all the people I meet
I want to take you out with me

It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not too lonely
And I begin to realize it
I can't have everything, everything
Oh, why can't I?
Or, do I?

Jesus is waiting on me
Just as he always does
Something'll be coming up
Just like it always does

It ain't no fun to be lonely
But I was not so lonely
I begin to realize that
I can't have everything, everything
Why can't I?

Why can't I?
Or, do I?
Why can't I?
Ooh, do I?
Why can't I?
Oh, do I?2Embed
