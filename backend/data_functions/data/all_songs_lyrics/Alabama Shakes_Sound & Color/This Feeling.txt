This Feeling Lyrics
I just kept hoping, I just kept hoping
The way would become clear
I spent all this time
Try'na play nice
And fight my way here

See, I've been having me a real hard time
But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright

So, I just kept dreamin', yeah, I just kept dreamin'
It wa'n't very hard
I spent all this time
Try'na figure out why
Nobody on my side

See, I've been having me a real good time
But it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright

So please don't take my feeling
I have found at last
So please don't take my feeling
I have found at last
That if I wanted to
I'd be alright
So I just kept goin', I just kept goin'
And hoping I'm growing near
Well, that's good and fine
I spent all this time
Try'n to find my way here

And I've been having me a real fun time
And it feels so nice to know I'm gonna be alright

Please don't take this feeling
I have found at last
Please don't take my feeling
I have found at last
Yeah, if I wanted to, I'd be alright
Now, if I wanted to, I'd be alright11Embed
