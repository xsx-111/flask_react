Stair Androids & Valley Um...? LyricsI don't wanna know
What you do when you're alone
Make your own way there
I'll catch up when I am ready
I don't wanna talk
Every minute, every hour
Take me as I come
I wish I could turn it off
But I guess it never stops
I'm dying inside, but I'm smiling
Sometimes I sit and think, and sometimes I just sit
I'm not thinking anything
Please stop asking how I'm feeling1Embed
