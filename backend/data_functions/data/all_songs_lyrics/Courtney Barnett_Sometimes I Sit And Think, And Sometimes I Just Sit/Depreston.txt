Depreston Lyrics
You said, "We should look out further"
I guess it wouldn't hurt us
We don't have to be around all these coffee shops
Now we've got that percolator
Never made a latte greater
I'm saving twenty-three dollars a week

We drive to a house in Preston
We see police arresting
A man with his hand in a bag
How's that for first impressions?
This place seems depressing
It's a Californian bungalow in a cul-de-sac

It's got a lovely garden
A garage for two cars to park in
Or a lot of room for storage if you've just got one
"And it's going pretty cheap," you say
Well, it's a deceased estate
Aren't the pressed metal ceilings great?
Then I see the handrail in the shower
A collection of those canisters for coffee, tea and flour
And a photo of a young man in a van in Vietnam
And I can't think of floorboards anymore
Whether the front room faces south or north
And I wonder what she bought it for
If you've got a spare half a million
You could knock it down and start rebuildin'
If you've got a spare half a million
You could knock it down and start rebuildin'
If you've got a spare half a million
You could knock it down and start rebuildin'
If you've got a spare half a million
You could knock it down and start rebuildin'
If you've got a spare half a million
You could knock it down and start rebuildin'
If you've got a spare half a million
You could knock it down and start rebuildin'19Embed
