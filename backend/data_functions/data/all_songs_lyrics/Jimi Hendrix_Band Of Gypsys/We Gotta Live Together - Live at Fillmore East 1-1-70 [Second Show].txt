We Gotta Live Together - Live at Fillmore East 1/1/70  Lyrics
The old house dog
Is wagging his tail
Nobody loves him
He's dirty as hell
They put him in home sweet hell
Everyone now

Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Got to be love beside you
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Got to be love beside you
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Got to be love beside you
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Got to be love beside you
Yeah
It's all
It's all
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

We've got to live together
Yeah
We've got to live together
Yeah
We've got to live together
Yeah
We've got to live togetherEmbed
