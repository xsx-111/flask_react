Human Disease (S.K.U.M.M.) LyricsWhatever painted part
Taught deeply enclosed in
Mother earth
Life born addict breathe angel
Whatever, paint it up
So closer to farther apart
Meat seeking missiles consuming rain forest
Meat seeking missiles consuming
Infested veins the river flow
Urban needle inject carcinogen
Chemicals relieve the stress
Slows consumer rotting
Sight, no taste
Odorless, clear seeping
Water poisoning
All producing nothing
Intelligent to cause disease
Human breeding
Self perpetuating
Whatever close at hand
Finger cramp
Virtuoso closet problem
Epileptic machine shudder shock
Who is over, who is on top
Who is over, who is on top
Malformed earth born
Malformed earth born
(Shake)
All is a disease
Biped walk so straight
All is a disease
Biped walk so straight
Earth can be as giving
As it can be irate
Earth can be as giving
As it can be irate
All a disease
Biped walk so straight
All a disease
To biped walk so straight
All a disease
Earth can be so giving
As it can be irate
Earth can be so giving
As it can be irate
All a disease, all a disease
What if to burn up and out
Up and out, with illing over doubt
Illing over doubt
Sight, no taste
Odorless, FDA recommends
To take daily allowance, allowance
26 unknown carcinogens
26 unknown cancer causing supplements
No taste, no taste
No taste, no fate
Infested
Chemicals, FDA
Virtuoso closet problem
Whatever to plot
Or build to self destruct
The so called lesser beast
Exhibits harmony
Walk straight biped, relate
Walk straight biped
Walking disease, walking disease
Walk straight biped
All a disease, all a disease, all a disease
The lesser beast exists in harmony
So called beast, so called lesser beast
So called lesser beast, so called beast
All is a disease
Human disease
Human, human disease
All, human disease (survival)Embed
