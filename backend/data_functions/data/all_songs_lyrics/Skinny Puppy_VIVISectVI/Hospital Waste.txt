Hospital Waste LyricsBlast and raw eye blood shot lid color concealed crimson trap thin lit
Mess code of darkness stop the ocean counting blood coughing blood and
Needle syringe in the islang thirst of drought raise through the real end
Ozone layer ultraviolet embalms sunless fire mistrust abandoning day long
Sinking monotones out to please to pattern the grey rain falls it drizzle
Colors negate so wild let it slide down time colors look crimson trains
Inside lost my footing ooze bite ant landslide no finding what through a
Lost door somewhere out there in open space where is there space to get
Off and go on there on tv the polluted lies the polluted noise mistrust no
Longer they don't give advice mono matters all to pleasing nobody the grey
Rain drizzles down my face negate mistrust dementiaEmbed
