Dogshit (Censor) Lyrics(Rest) low tar spell
(Fatigue) vermin crawling in
Livid gnaws fasting on tic and a flea in vain again
(Agro) flight not taking
(Fasting on) deception in the making
Turns two against three penny save a penny worth
Crystal marble powder shot glass overflow
Dreams amaze me
Time escapes me
Mirror shades what should be flight not taking
(Rest) a body's burning
(Compose) ears of rock
Guilty grey formaldehyde
Cripples hound a wheelchair
Guilty grey a wheelchair
Hounds you asshole
(Dead) palsey blue stupid
(Thaw) cuts the jaw
(Hell) piss fuck head
(Rest) pure acid hell
Filthy word mutation
Laughing hound hereafter
Hee hee ha ha
Stupid clown you assholeEmbed
