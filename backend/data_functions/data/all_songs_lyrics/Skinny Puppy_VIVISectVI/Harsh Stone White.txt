Harsh Stone White LyricsHarsh stone white
Harsh stone white, eyes behold
Bruise baths soak crying bones
Every day's appeal to stop
Spirit calm on valium
Hate permeates and fills the air
Icy clouds the atmosphere
Illusions pull hair, no reaction
How was this done?
It exists by extraction of reason
Drooling drips the bile of sanity
Through the thought lines vomiting
We're even, even
The clock wailed and sped past two
Tic tic toc in time
Is this real?
Is this real?
 understand myself
Understand myself
Understand myself, thinking
Stand back
Unafraid and unaffected
Stand back
Non-molested
Non-molested, non-molested
Molested
We're even, even
Down the drain
Down, down, down
We're even
Down, down, down again
Down, down, down again
Down there in the cracks
Face hidden cracks, cracks
Harsh stone white
Harsh stone white
We're even
We're even, evenEmbed
