Testure LyricsIn nervous convulsion
Crouches
Infant ape
Trembling
In mothers shit
Caged eyes, tear-less
Filled with contempt
Clinic mask experiment with Life and death
Smell lingering noxious
Mixed scent anxiety
Omnipotent doctor
Grinds the cage door
Revealing
Loves
Primal
Instinct
Taken away
The tiny face
Terrified
Rant and rave smash your head against the cage
Vacuum clicks on high
Conscious of the pain
Passed off as humane
White coat seems so clean most dirt bleached out of greed
Force the point of habit; eyes burn in a rabbit
Push the pain test button
Spines cut
Trip mucus inflection
More die. Pills each day
What goes around comes back stronger
Tap into the brain
Break the skull again
Smash, price, research rat, lab rent pain
In flesh more ill drug store sales
Sharpen the knife
Emphasis on money
New disease everyday
End is seen and coming
Research turns its back to gain
Crush the spine
Genocide
Kitten drags its dead limb
Continuing all suffering
It will come back and win
Shock paralyze
Turn trauma burns out the will to live the
Lying
Message 5 year genocide
1945 suicide
