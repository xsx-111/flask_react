Rock-A-Boy Blue LyricsThe girls are hip 'n' the men are divine
'n' everything is gin and roses
You are new to me an' I'm so happy
You can whisper and I will listen
The world becomes a motion picture
I got it beat oh I got it licked, yeah
Rock-a-girl blue
It seems so sad
But the film goes dim like a faraway star
A frozen frame like silver paper
When the kissing gets very hard
Just to try and get at something
When the representatives turn to leaders
As long as you know as long as you need us
We'll be there
You know it's true
Don't they love like a rock-a-boy should
Don't they rock like lonely lovers
Don't they want to make the money
Don't they want to be the Beatles
Things ain't clear, they're just transparent
The trick of the trade is to make them apparent-ly
Rock-a-boy blue
You know that I said that you know that
I learnt to live with the beats in the bar
Made me sick with repetition
I learnt to love that one note samba
No surprise or definition
I guess I can learn to love what I'm used to
If you can get used to just getting used by
Rock-a-boy blue
Baby, then more fool you
I learnt to live with the beats in the bar
That made me sick with repetition
I learnt to love that one note samba
No surprise or definition
I guess I can learn to love what I'm used to
If you can get used to just getting used by
Rock-a-boy blue
Baby, more fool youEmbed
