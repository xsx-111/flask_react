Sex LyricsSex sex sex - well don't bush around the beat
This is the soul of indiscretion so let's get indiscreet, yeah
Sex sex sex - watch you break out in a sweat
It's what you gonna get
Sex sex sex (uh-huh) - but you got the motion that the boys and
Girls all wanna touch and take it home
Just cut that small talk in the floorplay
Just cut that cute display
(get it up, get it on)
Just cut that chi chi 'n' machismo
I said oh oh oh
Sex sex sex - well you came here just to dance
Well c'est ci bon don't worry it's the same jouissance, yeah
Sex sex sex - don't ever let that go
You find any reason for what you wanna do now
But you got the motion that the boys 'n' girls all wanna touch and take it home
Get up and jump to debasement
Get up and masterstroke
(get it up, get it on)
Amoral disarmament baby
I said oh oh oh - yeah
Sex sex sex - well your angle is acute
You gotta lotta finesse in your sharkskin suit now
Sex sex sex - you don't need no excuse
Your body has a function so you put it to a use, yeah
But you got the motion that the boys 'n' girls all wanna touch and take it home
Just cut that small talk in the floorplay
Just cut that cute display
(get it up, get it on)
Amoral disarmament baby
I said oh oh oh - yeah
Sex sex sex
Sex sex sex - c'mon 'n' break that rule
Let's break t into pieces that are long 'n' sweet 'n' cool, yeah
Sex sex sex (oooh)- you ain't got no money
But you will afford to loosen up and let it go
Get up and jump to debasement
Get up and masterstroke
(get it up, get it on)
Just cut that chi chi 'n' machismo
I said oh oh oh - yeah
Sex sex sex - well let's lay it on the line
You can let me know with your eyes an' I'll let you know with mine, yeah
Sex sex sex - but don't bush around the beat
This is the soul of indiscretion, let's get indiscreet, yeah
You got the motion that the boys and girls all wanna touch and take it home
Just cut that small talk in the floorplay
Just cut that cute display
(get it up, get it on)
Amoral disarmament baby
I said oh oh oh - yeahEmbed
