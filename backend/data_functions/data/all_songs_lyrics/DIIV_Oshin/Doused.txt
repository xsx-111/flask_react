Doused LyricsNever had you run so far but you really gotta get away
You know it in the nighttime running to it
Caught a rising star but then you let it drop into
The ocean now the water's running through it
Now you've gone so far you really had to get away
You knew it in your lifetime, running to it
Acting like you've come so far the bed you made yourself
And this house and me are all falling apart
Never thought you'd go so far but now you're really
Gone and it's been so long I never really think about it
Yeah you made a beating heart, whatever, now that amber
Light has faded and it's yours to commit to it
Act like it stops and starts, a gesture here and there
For me is one thing but I felt it every time you blew it
Now you've gone too far your urge to run away is back and we all know9Embed
