Past Lives LyricsI was your home and you locked yourself outside
And run with your ghosts
Back to a place you'd already known
Nowhere to crawl but to your past life
And hide from it all
A buried flower convinced you'll grow
Kept enough to remind but stayed outside
With nowhere to go
You left nowhere to goEmbed
