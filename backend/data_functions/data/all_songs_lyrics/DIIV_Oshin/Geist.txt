Geist LyricsWe're all seeking it out inside of this
Feeling everything out, momentary bliss

Trying to single it out, trying to find the gist
We're all seeking it out inside of this
Feeling everything out momentary bliss
We're all seeking it out inside of this
Trying to single it out, trying to find the gistEmbed
