Human LyricsSunrise waiting
I knew myself completely then nothing I thought it hasn't said but
Youth light fading
I know myself as I was then birds sounding each shorter day in
Sun tries vainly
To stay lit for another day melts into darkness static state
Til young light waves in
Drink the heat and climb and twist fawn looking for a friend to kiss4Embed
