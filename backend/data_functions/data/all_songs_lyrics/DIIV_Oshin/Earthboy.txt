Earthboy LyricsIf I'm alone and you're free now
We know nothing's ever meant to be
But come along with me
And by my secret side that no one sees
I built a throne from a burden of need
Earth boy gets harvested or else recedes
So while you're cold Numb my dream
And I'll chew rocks and splinters sob and scream
Earth boy,.
Earth boy,.
Earth boy,.
You sit alone,.Embed
