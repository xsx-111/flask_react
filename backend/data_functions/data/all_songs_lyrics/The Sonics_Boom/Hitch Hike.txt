(Hitch hike)
I'm going to Chicago, that's the last place my baby stayed (hitch hike, hitch hike, baby)
I'm packing up my bags, I'm gonna leave this town right away (hitch hike, hitch hike, baby)
I'm gonna find that girl if I have to hitch hike 'round the world (hitch hike) hitch hike, babe
"Chicago City", that's what the sign on the freeway read (hitch hike, hitch hike, baby)
I'm gonna keep on going 'til I get to that street's called 6th and Main (hitch hike, hitch hike, baby)
I've gotta find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world (hitch hike) hitch hike, babe
Come on hitch hike (hitch hike) hitch hike children (hitch hike)

I'm going to St. Louis but my next stop just might be L.A. (hitch hike) that's what I say
I got no money in my pocket so I'm going to have to hitch hike all the way (hitch hike) hitch hike, children (hitch hike, baby)
I'm gonna find that girl if I have to hitch hike 'round the world (hitch hike) hitch hike, girl
Come on hitch hike (hitch hike) hitch hike children (hitch hike)
Hitch hike (hitch hike) hitch hike baby (hitch hike)
