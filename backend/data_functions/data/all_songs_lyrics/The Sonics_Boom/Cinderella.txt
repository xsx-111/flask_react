Cinderella LyricsHey Hey Hey Hey Hey everybody
I'm out looking for a girl
She's the sharpest one
In the whole wide world
I want to be her man
Gonna catch her if I can
I met her at the ball
You know, we danced all night
When I kissed her lips
She even held me tight
Disappeared by herself
When my clock struck 12
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Cinderella
Where have you gone
I got a glass slipper
For you to try on
I want to be your fella
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Cinderella
She's got a pretty long hair
And she's five-foot-two
When she ran away
I found her glass shoe
Won't somebody tell me
What am I gonna do
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Cinderella
