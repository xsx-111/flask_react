Louie Louie LyricsLouie Louie, oh baby I gotta go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Louie Louie, oh baby I gotta go
A fine little girl who waited for me
I catch a ship across the sea
I sailed the ship all alone
I wondered when I'm gonna make it home
Louie Louie, oh baby I gotta go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Louie Louie, oh baby I gotta go
Three nights and days I sailed the sea
I think of the girl constantly
On the ship, I dream she there
I smell the rose that's in her hair
Louie Louie, oh baby I gotta go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Louie Louie, oh baby I gotta go
I see Jamaican moon above
See the girl I'm thinkin' of
I take her in my arms and then
Say I'll never leave again
Louie Louie, oh baby I gotta go
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Louie Louie, oh baby I gotta go
Oh I gotta go now
Uh-huh I gotta go
OhEmbed
