The Hustler LyricsThere's a guy in town who gets all the chicks
From what I hear this dude he ain't no hick
He's big and tuff he's got the surfer hair
When there's a good looking honeys
You can bet he's there
All the sweeties dig him 'cause he plays it so cool
He's the hustler, yeah
He's got a car that's never been shot down
He drives everywhere you know, he really gets around
Every time you see him he's got a blond or brunette
And he ain't ever been put down yet
Every queen praise him 'cause he really swings
He's the hustler, yeah
He knows all the girls in town, whoa
He really gets around, whoa
He knows how to treat 'em
He loves 'em then he leaves 'em
GUITAR SOLO
He knows all the girls in town, whoa
He really gets around, whoa
He knows how to treat 'em
He loves 'em then he leaves 'em
The hustler knows what's going on
Don't ever tell him that he is wrong
Sometimes the girls go out of their mind
'Cause he treats them so unkind
All the girls dig him 'cause he knows what's boss
He's the hustler
Yeah, yeah he's the hustler
Yeah, yeah he's the hustlerEmbed
