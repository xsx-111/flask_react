Let The Good Times Roll LyricsGoodman-Lee
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on baby, let the good times roll, roll all night long
Oh baby, feel so good when you're home
Come on baby, rock me all night long
Come on baby, let's close the door
Come on baby, let's rock some more
Come on baby, let the good times roll, roll all night long
Come on baby, let's close the door
Come on honey, let's rock some more
Come on baby, let the good times roll, roll all night long
Oh baby, feel so good when you're home
Come on baby, rock me all night long
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let me thrill your soul
Come on baby, let the good times roll, roll all night longEmbed
