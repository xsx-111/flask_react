Jenny, Jenny LyricsGould-Lee
Jenny Jenny won't you please come home
I'm thinking 'bout you Baby 'cause I'm all alone
Won't you come back Baby 'fore it gets too late
I need your loving and I just can't wait
Ain't had no loving since I don't know when
Oooh Jenny Jenny please come back again
Jenny Jenny won't you please come back
Your love is bigger than a Cadillac
I tried to call you but I can't get through
Won't you tell me baby what you're trying to do
I'm tired of waiting here all alone
Oooh Jenny Jenny won't you please come home
Every night I call your name
Ooh Jenny Jenny I'm the one to blame
I still love you Baby when I'm all alone
Ooh Jenny Jenny, Jenny won't you please come home
Jenny Jenny where did I go wrong
Won't you come back Baby been away too long
I thought you loved me but I'm not too sure
Won't you tell me Baby what you leave me for
Come back Baby 'cause I'm all alone
Ooh Jenny Jenny won't you please come home
Lonely days lonely nights
Here without you, well I don't feel right
Need your love Babe won't you please just phone
Ooh Jenny Jenny, Jenny won't you please come home
Jenny Jenny won't you please come back
Your love is bigger than a Cadillac
I tried to call you but I can't get through
Won't you tell me baby what you're trying to do
I'm tired of waiting here all alone
Oooh Jenny Jenny won't you please come homeEmbed
