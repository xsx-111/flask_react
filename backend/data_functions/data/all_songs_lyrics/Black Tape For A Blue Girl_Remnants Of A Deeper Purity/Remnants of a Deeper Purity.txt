Remnants of a Deeper Purity LyricsShe was so beautiful to watch
Swirling in and out of view
A seemingly Spanish dancer hands and heel
A moonfaced girl with eyes downturned
Subtle flusters beneath blackened threads
Refined and tempting
So shy and enticing yet i fear
She'll disappear before the night ends
Time seems to bring us together again
A decade later and another face
Are you the girl I've been dreaming of?
You look like her, you smile like her
That raven-haired beauty of another time
A rush of memories washing over me
I've always been waiting for someone to set me free
Those eyes quietly tell me of a passion we could share
The dance reminds me of a life that we once knew
Snares for my hopes snares for my thoughts
Snares for my dreams drifting onto oblivion
Can you tell me about the intuition I feel
Can you tell me about everything I long to understand?
Remnants of a deeper purity
Remnants of a deeper purity
She was so beautiful to watch drifting out into oblivion
A moonfaced memory with eyes downturned
Are you the one the one I've been dreaming of?Embed
