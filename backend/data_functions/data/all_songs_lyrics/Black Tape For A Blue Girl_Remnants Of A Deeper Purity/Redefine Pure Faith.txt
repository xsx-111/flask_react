Redefine Pure Faith LyricsIf only i could taste one drop of your unhappiness
If only i could live again within your mystery
If only i could capture the essence of purity
Reawaken me, entranced by flesh and lace
A beauty haunts me, and encompassing embrace
No more lies, no more lies
The vulture has poisoned my garden
Fear, insecurities, shaped my actions
Redefine pure faith for me
Redefine pure faith for meEmbed
