With My Sorrows LyricsOn the tide withdrawn she disappeared, back to the deepest sea
The shells whisper secretly, she's the one I've waited for a thousand years
I feel it in the salted air, in the moon's moist breath
A need to recreate the worlds we once shared
Medieval mosques had warmed her then, charcoal blackened her eyes
Young, intense, untouchable. Weaving her spiral of desire
She had dreams beneath a golden sun, festivals passionate
Traded cruelly between hands of men, a possession. Masked, bound and sold
I listened to dreams of another life, painted in luscious breath
Pescaré a mi amor con mis dolores
Pescaré a mi amor con mis dolores
Beneath the sea is a tower, in the tower there's a window where she waits
It's a shame she sleeps alone, reach out to me I will come to you
In that case let me be a fisherman, I'll fish for my love with my sorrows
En la mar ay una torre
Y en la torre una velita
Y en la ventana una niña
Que a los marineros ama
Y en la ventana una niña
Que a los marineros ama
Si la mar se hace leche
Yo me hago pescador
Pescaré a mis dolores
Con palabritas de amor
Pescaré a mis dolores
Con palabritas de amorEmbed
