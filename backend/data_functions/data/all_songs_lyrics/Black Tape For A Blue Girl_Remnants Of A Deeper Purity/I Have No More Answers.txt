I Have No More Answers LyricsI know you need to ask of me
I know you need to ask of me
But i......
But i...... have no more
I have no more answers
I have no more answers
I have no more reasons why i lived that way
I have no more feelings
My eyes no longer cry
I've lost my tears
Here i stand
All of me before your eyes
No more lies. no more lies
Just me. pure meEmbed
