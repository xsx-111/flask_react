Crash-Pad Driver LyricsHere we drive through the smog and the rain
Osakan girl selling shrimps and fame
I love to breathe all these toxic fumes
See me dancing all alone in my room
In my brand new costume
Call it scenery
Call it hell
Try its beauty
Call it hell
Call it scenery
Call it hell
Try its beauty (I try its beauty)
Call it hell
Call it scenery (Call it scenery)
Call it hell
Try its beauty (I try its beauty)
Call it hell
Call it scenery (I call it scenery)
Call it hell
Try its beauty
Call it hell
Call it hell
Call it hell
Call it hell
Call it hell
I wash my laundry
At night
Here we drive through the streets of shame
Osakan girl selling her face and her pain
I love to breathe your neurotic fumes
Everybody lies, it's alright
Take a nap in my room
Call it scenery
Call it hell
Try its beauty
Call it hell
Call it scenery
Call it hell
Try its beauty (I try its beauty)
Call it hell
Call it scenery (I call it scenery)
Call it hell
Try its beauty (I try its beauty)
Call it hell
Call it scenery (I call it scenery)
Call it hell
Try its beauty
Call it hell
Call it hell
Call it hell
Call it hell
Call it hell
Call it hell
Destroy the shell
Call it hell
Destroy the shell
Call it scenery
Call it hell
Try its beauty
Call it hell
Call it scenery
Call it hell
Try its beauty
Call it hell
Call it scenery
Call it hell
Try its beauty
Call it hell
Call it scenery
Call it hell
Try its beauty
Call it hellEmbed
