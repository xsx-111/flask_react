Images of Sigrid LyricsWell we went on swimming love
And then we when we went to dance
And the breeze was surely gentle
For we didn't leave it any chance
We can never be too happy
So we wrote it as a law
We should not feel so lonely love
This sickness has to go
And if you dine with someone else
I will never take you down
For the night is standing bare
Waiting there to claim our crown
Will you lay beside me now
And help me with the rain
I'll blot it off the circle, love
It well never come back again
There are no clouds
Only blue skies
There are no clouds, today
There are no clouds
Only blue skies
There are never any clouds anyway
There are none who say so well
The things we should not know
There are none who say so well
This land we cannot sow
Will you lay beside me now
And cast your dreams down in the well
They'll form a shape up in the sky
The wind will lead it to our cells
There are no clouds
Only blue skies
There are no clouds, today
There are no clouds
Only blue skies
There are never any clouds anyway
There are no clouds
(Sigrid says she does not know)
Only blue skies
(Why these things just matter so)
There are no clouds, today
(Sigrid says she does not know why, oh)
There are no clouds
(Sigrid says she does not know)
Only blue skies
(Why these things just matter so)
There are never any clouds anyway
(Sigrid says she does not know why, oh)
Sigrid says she does not know
Why these things just matter so
Sigrid says she does not know why, ohEmbed
