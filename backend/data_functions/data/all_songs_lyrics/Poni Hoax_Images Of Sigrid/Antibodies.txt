Antibodies LyricsAlone, sex in shadow walks
At home with you
You say you have no control
At all, on you
The world is an empty place
Alone with you
Antibodies, antibodies, antibodies, antibodies
Antibodies, antibodies, antibodies, antibodies
Alone, sex in shadow says
The words "We're through"
These words have been such a waste
Our wishes show through
So I will forget your face
Each time we're through
Antibodies, antibodies, antibodies, antibodies
Antibodies, antibodies, antibodies, antibodiesEmbed
