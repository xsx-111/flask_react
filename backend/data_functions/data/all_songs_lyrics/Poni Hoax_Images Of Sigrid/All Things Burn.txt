All Things Burn LyricsAnd I will walk these streets
While my lust covers the shadows under its rust
And I will roam these streets
While salvation drives its way out of my crotch
Then you do it
Wipe my face
Fake a smile
Now I pass a turn
Wipe my senses
Make me lie
All things burn
Wipe my slate
Make me smile
Let's have some fun
And jump the fence
Clean the files
All things burn
Well you do it:
Here it comes
The endless fun
No one cares about
Then you climb in
What's your name?
It should last for a mile
Along your dreams now love
So we will fall along your dreams now love
And now I'm nowhere to be found
For you've hid me deep beneath the cover of your arms
And it is night or day?
Lease control and
Let me choose the way I'll have to pay
Then you do it:
Strike a match
Burn a flag
To keep you warm now
Through the slick furs
I'll lead you to
A place you've always seen
Corridors
Purple lights
A three-legged cat
A brand new nurse
Haunted houses
Hungry words
Well you do it:
Kill this city
Steal my face
Make me learn
Light a fire
Trash my place
For all things burn along your dreams now love
All things burn along your dreams now love
So we will fall along your dreams now loveEmbed
