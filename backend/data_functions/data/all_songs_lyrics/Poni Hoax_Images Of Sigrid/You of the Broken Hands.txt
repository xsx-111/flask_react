You of the Broken Hands LyricsYou don't walk
You just fall
You don't talk
You just call
"This life is too much to bear"
So you said
And I will comb your hair
"I feel so helpless and cold"
So you said
Don't despair
For I will sew you a coat
You don't cry
You just break
You don't smile
You just fake
"This life is too much to bear"
So you said
And I will comb your hair
"I know I'll never grow old"
So you said
Don't despair
For I will pay for your loans
You of the broken hands
You of the broken
"This life is too much to bear"
So you said
And I will comb your hair
"I feel so helpless and cold"
So you said
Don't despair
For I will sew you a coat

You of the broken hands
You of the broken
"This life is too much bear"
So you said
And I will comb your hair
"I feel a thousand years old"
So you said
Please be there
Just don't leave us aloneEmbed
