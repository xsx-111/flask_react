Pretty Tall Girls LyricsPretty tall girls
I know your sight upon the city
You're embarrassed
With your body
Pretty tall girls
I know your sight upon the city
You're embarrassed
With your body
I know how you're feeling
When you're laying down to sleep
I know how you're feeling
Watch horizontal TV
Pretty tall girls
Fat witty girls
I carry your weight across the city
You're embarrassed
With your body
Fat witty girls
I carry your weight across the city
You're embarrassed
With your body
I know how you're feeling
When you're laying down to sleep
I know how you're feeling
Watch horizontal TV
Fat witty girls
Teenage drunk boy
I fight your fight against the city
You're embarrassed
With nobody
Teenage drunk boy
I fight your fight against the city
You're embarrassed
With nobody
And if you know how we're feeling
When you're laying down to sleep
And if you know how we're feeling
Well, tell us all about it
Pretty tall girls
Fat witty girls
Teenage drunk boys
Teenage drunk boys
Pretty tall girls
Fat witty girls
Teenage drunk boys
Teenage drunk boys
Pretty tall girlsEmbed
