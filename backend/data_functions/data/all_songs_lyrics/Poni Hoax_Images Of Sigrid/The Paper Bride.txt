The Paper Bride LyricsIt takes one to know one
And I know that I've been had again
It takes one to know one
And I know that I've been framed
And you say you're sorry
That someone came and stole your bike
And I said don't worry
Why don't you go and take a hike
It takes one to know one
There's always someone on the prowl
It takes one to know one
No game's fair and no game's foul
And you say you're sorry
That we're all mindless animals
And I said don't worry
I have already read the bible
Well stay with me
Just stay with me
So stay with me
'Til tomorrow
It takes one to know one
A week is long, its end is loud
It takes one to know one
All love is built upon the ashes of a shroud
And you say you're sorry
That someone came and stole your pride
And I say don't worry
We'll drown our shame side by side
Well stay with me
Just stay with me
So stay with me
'Til tomorrow
There is nothing more to say
We will burn the paper bride today
There is nothing more to say
We will burn the paper bride today
There is nothing more to say
We will burn the paper bride todayEmbed
