Hypercommunication LyricsThe satellites are screaming
Calling out for love
The city feels so queer now
Ken uses some hand cream
Well, you just seem so sad now
Is anybody in?
Barbie grabs a gun
I hope she'll have some fun, some fun-un-un-un-un
So just hang on to your pillow
Oh, I could love you so
You will never call me back
For you know that you've been bad
I will never call you back
These things aren't even sad
Hyper-communication
Send back all invitations
And he cleans the windows
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
And she feeds the dogs
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
And she tortures her laptop
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
And he cuts a fuckin' log
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
The neons flash on your face
Somehow you look so fine
The rain pours out through the lace
Does it make you mine?
And then you grab your gun
For I'm the only one, -ly one-on-on-on-on
If I had no ego
You would despise me so
Will you ever call me back?
For you're scared of being sad
Will I ever call you back?
These things just drive me mad
Hyper-communication
Send back all invitation, love
And he cleans the windows
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
And she feeds the dogs
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
And she tortures her laptop
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
And he cuts a log
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
There goes your mountain, I will climb now
There goes your mountain, I will climb mine
There goes your mountain, I will climb mine
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
There goes your mountain, I will climb mine
(Can you sleep without dreaming of me now?)
There goes your mountain, I will climb mine
There goes your mountain, I will climb mine
There goes your mountain, I will climb mineEmbed
