My Own Private Vietnam LyricsLand down under the odd lights, love
Something you used to see
Has crawled on your arm
Then froze in your palm
Then you start your fuss with me
I conjure up a demon
That splits my grace in two
It plays the lotto, only wins the bingo
Then it leads all ladies to dine
In my own private Vietnam
(So here we go 'gain)
Drunk talks then drunk sleeps
Drunk liver's getting weak
Drunk talks then drunk sleeps
His canals are starting to leak
Splish splash goes the whiplash
It splits my face in two
There's one half for daddy, and one half for you
And the rest I'm selling it as spam
In my own private Vietnam
(So here we go 'gain)
Drunk walks then drunk talks
Drunk liver's getting weak
Drunk talks then drunk sleeps
And I'm so tired of this shit
So start a fuss with me now, love
So start a fuss with me
So start a fuss with me now, love
So start a fuss with me
So start a fuss with me now, love
So start a wicked fuss with me
So start a fuss with me now, love, love
So start a fuss with me
So start a fuss with me now, love
So start a fuss with me
So start a fuss with me now, love, my love
So start a fuss with me
So start a fuss with me now, love
So start a wicked fuss with me
So start a wicked fuss with me now, love
So start a fuck it fuss with me
Start a-
So start a fuss with me
So start a fuss with me
So start a fuss with me now, love
So start a wicked fuss with me
So start a wicked fuss with me now, love
So start a fuss with me
So start a fuss with me now, love
Just start'a fuck with meEmbed
