Faces in the Water LyricsFaces in the water
Every time to wash the dishes I turn on the tap
Traces of your faded face
Every time I drown myself in the eyes of the cat
What would you say today?
Where would you play?
I just don't know
I just don't know, honey
Faces in the water
There's a monkey in the attic that will share its stash
Traces of your faded face
You just fell too deep down the well to ever climb back
What would you say today?
Where would you play?
I just don't know
I just don't know, honeyEmbed
