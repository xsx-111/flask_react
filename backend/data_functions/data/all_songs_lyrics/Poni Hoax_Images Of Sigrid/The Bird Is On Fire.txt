The Bird Is On Fire LyricsThere's no way that things will change
Until you learn to say I'm sorry
Until the world spins around me
You will say that everything's okay
And we'll laugh to the whole of the story
For we know that's where's born tragedy
The girl is on fire
The girl is on fire
Then I'd sing
Then she'd lose
The girl is on fire
The girl is on fire
Then I'd sing
Then she'd use
Me
Our senses shot in a parking lot
Back to the place where we belong
The shit storm intruding our song
Save your ways for someone who will care
There's no one here who'll step outside
It's much too rough to risk our pride
The girl is on fire
The girl is on fire
Then I'll sing
Then she'll lose
The girl is on fire
The girl is on fire
Then I'll sing
Then she'll use
Me
Everyone is gone, this is no fun
Everyone is gone, this ain't no fun
The bird is on fire
The bird is on fire
This bird is on fire
And it sings about youEmbed
