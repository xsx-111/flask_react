For My Lover Lyrics
Two weeks in a Virginia jail
For my lover, for my lover
Twenty thousand dollar bail
For my lover for my lover

And everybody thinks that I'm the fool
But they don't get any love from you
The things we won't do for love
Climb a mountain if I had to
Risk my life so I could have you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

Everyday I'm psychoanalyzed
For my lover, for my lover
They dope me up, and I tell them lies
For my lover, for my lover

And everybody thinks that I'm the fool
But they don't get any love from you
The things we won't do for love
Climb a mountain if I had to
Risk my life so I could have you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I follow my heart
And leave my head to ponder
Deep in this love
No man can shake
I follow my heart
And leave my mind to wonder
Is this love worth
The sacrifices I make?

Two weeks in a Virginia jail
For my lover, for my lover
Twenty thousand dollar bail
For my lover, for my lover

Everyday I'm psychoanalyzed
For my lover, for my lover
Dope me up, and I tell them lies
For my lover, for my lover

Everybody thinks that I'm the fool
But they don't get any love from you
The things we won't do for love
Climb a mountain if I had to
Risk my life so I could have you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you1Embed
