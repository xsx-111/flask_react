If Not Now... Lyrics
If not now, then when?
If not today, then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none

You can wait til morning comes
You can wait for the new day
You can wait and lose this heart
You can wait and soon be sorry

Cause if not now, then when?
If not today, then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none

Now love's the only thing that's free
We must take it where it's found
Pretty soon it may be costly

Cause if not now, then when?
If not today, then
Why make your promises?
A love declared for days to come
Is as good as none
If not now, what then
We all must live our lives
Always feeling, always thinking
The moment has arrived
If not now, then when1Embed
