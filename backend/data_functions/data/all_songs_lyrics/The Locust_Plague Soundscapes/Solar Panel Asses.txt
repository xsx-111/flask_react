Solar Panel Asses LyricsGive back those dirty plungers
The trumpet players can't bleed without them
The spinster mechanic is late to work
No eat, no sleep, ect
Well what did you expect?
Purple headed warriors on the front lines?
Social sardines for a better tomorrow
Guilt absorption in a two ass radius
Bragging about your salad tossing
Leaving you full of amino acidsEmbed
