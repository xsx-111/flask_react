Who Wants A Dose Of The Clap? LyricsNo man of cloth
Gonna go through my wallet
No mercenary
Gonna make CIA
No man of cloth
Gonna go through my wallet
No mercenary

Steaks are cooking, come inside
Mash food
On the few remaining molars
Hear flies
Steaks are cooking, come inside
Sinking in the same sack
Of salivating quicksand
Drown or row?
Drown, droneEmbed
