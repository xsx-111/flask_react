Late For A Double Date With A Pile Of Atoms In The Water Closet LyricsArbiter of shittily planned dilemmas
You were born with only three faces
Shit down to the sub-atomic level
To the last quark
Martyrs mocking, lepers vomiting
While everyone and their mother
Team up with toilet water
Don't forget to tell your face
Swish swish gargle gargle
This here bowl is half full of shit
And this here shit shall set you freeEmbed
