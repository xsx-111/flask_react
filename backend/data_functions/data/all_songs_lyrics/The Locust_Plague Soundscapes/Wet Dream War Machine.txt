Wet Dream War Machine LyricsStop talking politics
Rephrase, rephrase
Hibernating phantom friend
Witness, witness
There's a hotbed of isms around here
All hail the chopper, the blitzkrieg, the tank
Never mind the ethics involved
All hail the chopper, the blitzkrieg, the tank
Never mind the ethics involved
Stop talking politics
Calculate, eliminate
Aaahhh
Witness, this mess
Who's got their nightmare glasses?
It's time to go diving
Prime time is crime time is nuclear might
All hail the chopper, the blitzkrieg, the tank
Never mind the ethics involvedEmbed
