Your Mantel Disguised As A Psychic Sasquatch LyricsThe chicken bit it (The foreskin knew it)
The sultry salesman worked
To keep his high heels on
Oh, the doors are talking
Oh, the sheets are stained
A fleshy bowl of nonsense says
"Apparently a slut's been made!"
Why must the fortune teller
Always do the dirty work?
It bit the chicken (The skin foresaw it)
And sultry heels worked
To keep the salesman high
Can I touch your telepathic private parts?Embed
