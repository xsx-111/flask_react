Look at Little Sister LyricsHey, hey, hey, hey, hey mama, look at little sister
Out in the back yard, playing like this
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, look at litle sister
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look at little sister
What about the neighbors, what they gonna say
Stop little sister, gettin' carried away
Hey, hey, hey, look at little sister
Hey, hey,hey,hey, look at little sister
Shakin' like a tree, rollin' like a log
Shakin' and 'a rollin' now, that ain't all
Hey, hey, hey, look at little sister
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look at little sister
Shakin' like a tree, rollin' like a log
Shakin' and 'a rollin' now, that ain't all
Hey, hey, hey, look at little sister
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look at little sister
What about the neighbors, what they gonna say
Stop little sister, gettin' carried away
Hey, hey, hey, look at little sister
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look at little sisterEmbed
