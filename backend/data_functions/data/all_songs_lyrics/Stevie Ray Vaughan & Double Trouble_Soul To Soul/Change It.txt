Change It LyricsYou can't change it, can't rearrange it
If time is all that we got, then baby, let's take it
Lovin' is a lovin', the moment is a-right
It's worth all the years in the past, let's go one more night
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey, I want you to be by my side
Me and my backdoor moves ain't no more, no more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey, I want you to be by my side
Me and my backdoor moves ain't no more, no more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey, I want you to be by my side
Me and my backdoor moves ain't no more, no more
Goonight my darlin', another day has passed
Forget all those painful memories, our love's gonna last
Come to me baby, come to me one more time
It's time we got movin', time to move on
Let's slide out the door, let's slide out the door
Ride our way home, let's glide our way home
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, I've come back for moreEmbed
