Come On (Part III) Lyrics
People talkin' but they just don't know
What's in my heart and why I love you so
I love you baby like a miner loves gold
Come on baby, let the good times roll

Let the good times roll
Come On it soothes my soul
Oh, let the good times roll
Come On, Come On, Come On

A lot of people live in make-believe
They keep a lot of dirt up their sleeve
My love, baby it ain't the kind to fold
Come on baby, let the good times roll

Let the good times roll
Come On and let it roll
Ah yeah
Let it roll, Come On, let it roll

Our lovin's nice if it's understood
It's even nicer when you feel so good
You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole
Come on sugar, let the good times roll

Oh, let the good times roll, come on let it roll
Come On, Come On
Come On, Come On
Come On, let it roll
