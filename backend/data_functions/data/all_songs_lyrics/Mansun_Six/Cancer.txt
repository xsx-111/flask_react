Cancer LyricsMy book of Mormon
Wrapped in Turin
And it seems inferior and jittery
You preach elastic
To your jagged flock
In an eerie passion for self-flattery
I'm emotionally raped by Jesus
I'm emotionally raped by Jesus now
But I'm still here
Yes, somehow I'm still here
What now of my faith
Just a desperate exercise to limit pain
I am weak
I'm emotional and sensitive and frail
In need of some love
Pull the cancer from the Vatican's own state
Uninformed
You will harbour those who nurtured Europe's War
Keep turning my cheek
In a fragile state of violence left me weak
No guilt
Hold your people in disdain and steal their grace
I need replacement
To feel redefined
And it's just this matter of identity
You preach elastic
To your jagged flock
It's an eerie passion for self-flattery
Emotionally I'm wrapped in shame
Emotionally I feel I'm raped
Oh, emotionally in chains
What now of my faith
It's a desperate exercise to limit pain
No guilt
Hold your people in disdain and steal their grace
Keep turning my cheek
I'm emotional and sensitive and weak
Uninformed
You have harboured those who nurtured Europe's WarEmbed
