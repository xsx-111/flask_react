Six Lyrics
And you see, I kind of shivered to conformity
Did you see the way I cowered to authority
You see, my life, it's a series of compromises anyway
It's a sham, and I'm conditioned to accept it all, you see

(More) than I had before
(More) than I've presently got
(More) than I'll ever use up
(More) than I really need
(More) than I had before
(More) than I've presently got
(More) than I'll ever use up
(More) than I really need
(More) than I had before
(More) than I could possibly spend
(More) than I'll ever use up
(More) than I really need
(More) than I had before
(More) than I could possibly spend
(More) than I'll ever use up
(More) than I really need
It's more than I can spare
My religion is caged
Safe from progress, purgatory I know
How does this affect me
Emotionally affect me
Will they let me go
Will they let me go
Will they let me go
Equilibrium imbalanced again

I feel no pain
I feel no...
I feel no pain
The Jabberwocky haunts me, in my memory it's caged
I feel no pain (I feel no pain)
I feel no... (I feel no...)
I feel no pain (I feel no...)
But if you punched me in the stomach then I'd feel it again
I feel no pain
I feel no...
I feel no pain
But if you punched me in the stomach then I'd feel it again
Life is a compromise anyway
Life is a compromise anyway
Life, it's a compromise anyway
Life, it's a compromise anyway
And it's a sham, and I'll accept it all
Life is a compromise anyway
Life is a compromise anyway
Life, it's a compromise anyway
Life, it's a compromise anyway
And it's a sham, and I'll accept it all

And you see, I kind of shivered to conformity
Did you see the way I cowered to authority
You see, and my life, it's a series of compromises anyway
It's a sham, and I'm conditioned to accept it all, you see

(More) than I had before
(More) than I've presently got
(More) than I'll ever use up
(More) than I really need
(More) than I had before
(More) than I've presently got
(More) than I'll ever use up
(More) than I really need
(More) than I had before
(More) than I've presently got
(More) than I'll ever use up
(More) than I really need
(More) than I had before
(More) than I could possibly spend
(More) than I'll ever use up
(More) than I really need
It's more than I can spare
My religion is cagedEmbed
