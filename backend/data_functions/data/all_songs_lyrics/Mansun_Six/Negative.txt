Negative Lyrics
Stop you're looking miserable
Can't be bothered getting up today
My future's looking positive
No one even picked on me today

So you tested negative
Panic in your bedsit goes away
You convert to Scientology
To feel a part of something once again

I look downwards
I look downwards
Feeling negative
Looking negative
I see downwards
I see downwards
I look downwards
I see negative
Feeling negative
Looking downwards

Have you ever told a lie to hide a lie
Shame on you, you've compromised again
'Cos things are closing in on you
Not so far away as they may seem
Have you ever told a lie to hide a lie
Shame on you, you've compromised again
And things are closing in on you
Not as far away as they may seem

I look downwards
I see downwards
Seeing negative
Are you negative
I see downwards
I look downwards
I see downwards
Feeling negative
Seeing negative
Looking downwards

Someone nudged me in the street
Someone looked at me twice
Now I'm negative
Someone nudged me in the street
Someone poked me in the eye
Now I'm negative
I look downwards
I look downwards
Feeling negative
Seeing negative
I feel downwards
I see downwards
I see downwards
Feeling negative
Negative
Downwards

I look downwards
I see downwards
Feeling negative
Negative
Downwards
I feel downwards
I see downwards
Looking negative
Seeing negative
Looking downwardsEmbed
