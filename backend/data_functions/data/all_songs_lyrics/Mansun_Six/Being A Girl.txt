Being A Girl Lyrics
Being a boy's like sucking on a lemon
And I judge myself by the adverts I see
My deodorant hides the real me
These things elevate me above animals

I feel like being a girl
Being a girl, being a girl, being a girl, being a girl
And my life never tasted sweeter

I'm so boring, my clothes wanna keep
Someone else warm, someone cooler
Tax on cigarettes, treats my cancer
These things elevate me above animals

I feel like being a girl
Being a girl, being a girl, being a girl, being a girl
And my life never tasted sweeter

Being a girl, being a girl, being a girl, being a girl
Feels like being a girl
Being a girl, being a girl, being a girl, being a girl
And my life never tasted sweeter
A frog, it cannot comprehend the sea
Nor me happiness
Girl is much to weak a word for me
Made from balsa wood

Being a girl, being a girl
I want to experience being a girl
I want to experience being a girl
I want to experience being a girl

The only pureness left is preached by Marx
Time to contemplate
Never been informed there must be poor
Or the rich won't be rich no more

Being a girl, being a girl
I want to experience being a girl
I want to experience being a girl
I want to experience being a girl
I want to experience being a girl
I want to experience being a girl
I want to experience being a girl
The only pureness left is preached for me by Marx
The only pureness left is preached for me by Marx
The only pureness left is preached by MarxEmbed
