Anti Everything Lyrics
Anti everything (live in Richard Rogers' doorways)
I care nothing (lives at the bottom of your strung-out conscience)
Except mescalin (take the day off, it's cheap for cider)
I pay for sex in sleeping bags

I smell you on me
Phased out of your life
You're no different from me

I tell you anti-everything (love him and hate him both at the same time)
I care nothing (lives at the bottom of your strung-out conscience)
Except mescalin (take the day off, it's cheap for cider)

Find a place where you can rest
Your sleepy head and won't get pissed with me
Find a place where you can rest
Your sleepy head and won't get pissed with meEmbed
