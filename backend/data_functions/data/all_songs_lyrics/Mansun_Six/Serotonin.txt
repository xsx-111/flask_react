Serotonin LyricsMy migraine makes me ill
My electricity is low
My laceration soothes itself
My chemicals flow
And I'm boosting what I take
Just like the Germans, getting off
On herbal vacuum - pumps of blow
It shows all I know
And I drop and I drop
And my body levels drop
And my nerves clogging up
Sucking all the substance up
With this method that I have found
I'm redressing all I know
I can change the amount of God
That wraps around me
From a satellite they fire
Serotonin from eight miles
Above Deeside in binary
It orbits my street
