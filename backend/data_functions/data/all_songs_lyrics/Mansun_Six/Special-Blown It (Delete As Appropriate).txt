Special/Blown It (Delete As Appropriate) LyricsI've blown it in every single way
Screwed every single chance that came
You're a super star in waiting for the silver screen
Then the pressure came
Swept away in a tidal wave
Could be all of you, still awake at noon
Blew my chances in a tragic flurry, sweeping apathy
Buy all my food from the B.P store when the night kicks in
I'm turning my back on everyone
I've blown everything I've ever done
I've fucked it up, shot my load
Spewed onto the motorway shoulder
I could have been somebody special
I'm not such a tragic waste of space
I could bring happiness to people
Just one more greatest hits tour for the devotees
The same old faces came
They love their summer spectaculars
By the grace of God could be up by noon
And not a tragic waster but I can't stay focused for my apathy
They could have bought me a brand new car and a house in France
I've really blown it now
Blew it all away on a whim
Sat on my own for far too long
Things could have been so different now
Life looks so confusing through my window bay
Just to see a face, I'm really pleased when the gas man comes
Could be all of you still awake at noon
Blew my chances in a tragic flurry of apathy
All my food from a B.P store when the night kicks in
I've really blown it now
Blew it all away on a whim
But I fucked it up, shot my load
Spewed onto the motorway shoulder
I could have been somebody specialEmbed
