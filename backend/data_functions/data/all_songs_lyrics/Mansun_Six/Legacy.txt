Legacy Lyrics
If you fear transition to your other life
Don't need money to be there
Leave behind your money just to prove your worth
Won't be here so I don't care
If you strap your conscience to your vision thing
Won't be here so I don't care
Prove your worth to people that you called your friends
Won't be here so I don't care

I wouldn't care if I was washed up tomorrow you see
Reading novels is banned by the Marquis de Sade
All relationships are emptying and temporary

Life is wearing me thin
I feel so drained my legacy a sea of faces just like me
And life is wearing me thin
I feel so drained my legacy a sea of faces just like me

I've been drained emotion is a bitter fate
Won't be here so I don't care
I concede relationships have left me weak
Won't be here so I don't care
Look for something worthy to replace my guilt
Won't be here so I don't care
Prove my worth to people who I called my friends
Won't be here so I don't care
I wouldn't care if I was washed up tomorrow you see
Reading novels is banned by the Marquis de Sade
All relationships are emptying and temporary

Life is wearing me thin
I feel so drained my legacy a sea of faces just like me
And life is wearing me thin
I feel so drained my legacy a sea of faces just like me

Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone

I wouldn't care if I was washed up tomorrow you see
Reading novels is banned by the Marquis de Sade
All relationships are emptying and temporary

Life is wearing me thin
I feel so drained my legacy a sea of faces just like me
And life is wearing me thin
I feel so drained my legacy a sea of faces just like me
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're gone
Nobody cares when you're goneEmbed
