Plastic Cup Politics Lyrics
Hello six pack of confidence
Been so many nights since we first met
Glad to see you've brought all your friends
For another night of plastic cup politics

Hello Mr. Six pack of confidence
I'm glad to see you've already met
Ms. Twelve ounces of loneliness
And Mr. Plastic cup politics
I see you're under the influence
Of warm beer and the comfort of all your friends
And I see Mr. Loud Mouth has had his 40 ounce

And will pass out, I have no doubt
So drop your plastic cups and clear your clouded heads

I keep asking myself if they realize
That their fears are really just the same as mine
Do you know how your insecurities
Are the same ones that are inside of me?
As people come and go
Do they know they're really not alone?
And the life of the party just left
I guess I couldn't cure his emptiness
Like all the rest
So drop your plastic cups and clear your clouded heads
Clear your clouded heads

Here we are on another wasted night
And I am right along your side
Of forty sets of bloodshot eyes
And plastic smiles miles wide
Match plastic cups we'll leave behind

Whoa-oh-oh-whoa-oh-ho-whoa-oh
Its just another night of plastic cup politics
Plastic cup politics, plastic cup politics
Plastic cup politics, plastic cup politics
So drop your empty cups and clear your clouded headsEmbed
