Welcome to the New South Lyrics
Welcome home outcasts because I know how you have felt over the years
The truth is that looking at me is like looking in the mirror
And I know how it feels to be the best part of a running joke to all of your friends

And to be on the edge of your bed
With your head buried in your hands
Wishing everything would end
Yeah, I know how it feels to be the loneliest

Welcome back outcasts because I've told myself that it would be alright
Probably about a million times over every minute of all my life
I know how it feels to be so confused that you're so far out of control

And to be on the edge of your bed
With your head buried in your hands
Wishing that everything would end
Yeah, I know how it feels to be the loneliest

So you sit and wait for a sign
That the coming days will be alright
And you drink so you can forget another night
Bruised from the blackouts and your blood red eyes
Try to start looking for the brighter side
And wait for a sign, wait for a sign, wait for a sign
Welcome home, everything will be alright
Welcome home outcasts because I know how you have felt over the years
The truth is that looking at me is like looking in the mirror
And I know how it feels to be the best part of a running joke for all of your life

Welcome home
Outcasts, welcome home
Outcasts, welcome home
Outcasts, welcome home
Welcome homeEmbed
