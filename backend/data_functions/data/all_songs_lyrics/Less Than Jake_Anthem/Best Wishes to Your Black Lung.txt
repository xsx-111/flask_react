Best Wishes to Your Black Lung Lyrics
By this time tomorrow
You'll be out on the streets of Chicago
Walking all the way home from commuter trains
Oh yeah yeah yeah, by this time tomorrow
You'll be back at home in Chicago
Be at the bars until they close
And back at places that you've known and

It's gonna be skylines and rooftops, yeah yeah
Yeah, and it's gonna be crowded tourist stops

So it's goodbye to your brand new life
So it's good luck, best wishes to your black lung
So it's goodbye to your brand new life
So it's good luck, best wishes to your black lung

By this time tomorrow
You'll be walking home through Chicago
Past the 9 to 5 crowds and underneath
Those unused fire escapes
This time tomorrow
You'll be at the bars in Chicago
Back with people that you know
And going places you used to go, yeah
It's gonna be skylines and rooftops, yeah yeah
Yeah, and it's gonna be crowded tourist stops

So it's goodbye to your brand new life
So it's good luck, best wishes to your black lung
So it's goodbye to your brand new life
So it's good luck, best wishes to your black lung
So when you're leaving the party just to beat the crowd
Just make sure that you're the first one out (The first one out)
So it's goodbye to your brand new life
So it's good luck, best wishes to your black lung

Your black lung
Your black lung
Your black lung

It's gonna be skylines and rooftops, yeah yeah
Yeah, and it's gonna be crowded tourist stops

So it's goodbye to your brand new life
So it's good luck, best wishes to your black lung
So it's goodbye to your brand new life
So it's good luck, best wishes to your black lung
So when you're leaving the party just to beat the crowd
Just make sure that you're the first one out (The first one out)
So it's goodbye to your brand new life
So it's good luck, best wishes to your black lung
Your black lung
Your black lung
Your black lungEmbed
