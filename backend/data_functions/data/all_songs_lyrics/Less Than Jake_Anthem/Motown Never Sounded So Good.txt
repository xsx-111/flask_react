Motown Never Sounded So Good Lyrics
So you say all your white flags are up
And that you've had enough
And you're tired of collecting dust
You say everything always looks the same
And you made your brand new face
To match your brand new place
You say all your distress calls have gone out
And your ship is going down

Well, I say it to myself all the time
Stop living half a life and stop
Feeling like I'm half alive

I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied
I've wasted my time with this daily grind
In single file lines, is this real life?
I keep telling myself, "Sometimes
What matters is on the inside"

Do you remember when we had all the answers?
And can you really remember
When we wished for anything better?
Does feel like it's been forever?
Does it feel like a broken record, head full of yesterdays?
You keep wishing your life away
You can't keep looking over you own shoulder
Things will never look up unless you start to move forward
Well, I say it to myself all the time
Stop living half a life and stop
Feeling like I'm half alive

I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied
I've wasted my time with this daily grind
In single file lines, is this real life?
I keep telling myself, "Sometimes
What matters is on the inside"

I can't get enough, I'm not satisfied
I've wasted my time with this daily grind
Yeah, I can't get enough, I'm just getting by
I can't stand this design for our bitter lives
I keep feeling lost, and I'm not satisfied
With traffic and turnpikes and these tired eyes
Yeah, I can't get enough, yeah, I'm not satisfied
I've wasted my time with this daily grind
In single file lines, is this real life?
I keep telling myself, "Sometimes
What matters is on the inside"Embed
