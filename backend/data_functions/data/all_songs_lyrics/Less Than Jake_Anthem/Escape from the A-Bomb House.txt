Escape from the A-Bomb House Lyrics
Dear Mom and Dad, I've been making plans
To leave this house, and yes I'm sure
So lock the door, and turn the front porch lights out

And after all the endless fights
The who's been wrong and who's been right
We just never saw eye to eye

So there's no need to apologize
Don't wait up, I'll be fine
If you could see inside my head
Maybe you would understand
That I'm better and I'm better off gone
I'm better off gone

Dear Mom and Dad, I've been making plans
To leave your house, and yes I'm sure
That nothing's wrong, so just be strong on my way out

And after all the endless nights
The who's been wrong and who's been right
We just never saw eye to eye
So there's no need to apologize
Don't wait up, I'll be fine
If you could see inside my head
Maybe you would understand
That I'm better off, I'm better off gone

I'm better off gone
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
I'm better off gone
'Cause we don't see eye to eye


So there's no need to apologize
Don't wait up, I'll be fine
If you could see inside my head
Maybe you would understand
That I'm better and I'm better off gone

I'm better off gone
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
I'm better off gone
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
I'm better off gone
('Cause we don't see eye to eye)
I'm better off gone
'Cause we don't see eye to eye
('Cause we don't see eye to eye)Embed
