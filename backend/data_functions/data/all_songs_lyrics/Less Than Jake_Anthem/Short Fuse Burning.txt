Short Fuse Burning Lyrics
These are all reasons why
I'll be exploding tonight
And why this chip on my shoulder feels like a mile wide
It's from the overworked
Overtime compromise

So I'm looking tonight for some peace of mind
Maybe then I'll find some strength inside
'Cause I've lost any hope of ever changing
I'm a short fuse burning
I'm a short fuse burning

And remember who I, who I used to be
Because this one-trick pony's so strung on routine
And stuck on repeat
Like you wouldn't even believe

So I'm looking tonight for some peace of mind
Maybe then I'll find some strength inside
'Cause I've lost any hope of ever changing
I'm a short fuse burning
Hey everybody, don't forget me, forget me
Hey everybody, don't forget me, I forgot who I used to be
And I'm a short fuse burning, I'm so close to exploding
So everybody, don't forget me, I forgot who I used to be


So I'm looking tonight for some peace of mind
Maybe then I'll find some strength inside
'Cause I've lost any hope of ever changing
I'm a short fuse burning

Hey everybody, don't forget me, forget me
Hey everybody, don't forget me, I forgot who I used to be
And I'm a short fuse burning, I'm so close to exploding
Hey everybody, don't forget me, I forgot who I used to beEmbed
