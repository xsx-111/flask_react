The Ghosts of Me and You Lyrics
I've been down
Wandering past 2nd street and looking at
The ghosts of you and me
And thinking back on all those memories of how we used to be
I've been hearing
I hear those voices over the noises of the breaking glass
And all those plans we had to get us through
They're never coming true

And I hope and hope that you won't forget
And I hope and hope you know that I can clearly see

The ghosts of you and me
And I'm just a moved-on memory
And you're still alive
And I'm still getting by
Down these dead end streets
The ghosts of you and me

I'm still talking
I talk of what we'll do to the ghosts of me and you
And I'm still looking back into the past
When we were all we had
And I hope and hope that you won't forget
And I hope and hope you know that I can clearly see

The ghosts of you and me
And I'm just a moved-on memory
And you're still alive
And I'm still getting by
Down these dead end streets
The ghosts of you and me
The ghosts of you and me
The ghosts of you and me

Hope you won't forget
Hope you know that I'll always regret those things I said
Hope you know that I can clearly see

The ghosts of you and me
'Cause I'm just a moved-on memory
And you're still alive
And I'm still getting by
Down these dead end streets
The ghosts of you and me
The ghosts of you and me
The ghosts of you and me
The ghosts of you and meEmbed
