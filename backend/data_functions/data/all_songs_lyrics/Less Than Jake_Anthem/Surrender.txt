Surrender Lyrics
Mother told me yes, she told me I'd meet girls like you
She also told me, "Stay away, you'll never know what you'll catch"
Just the other day, I heard a soldier falling off
Some Indonesian junk that's going 'round

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay!

Father says, "Your mother's right, she's really up on things"
"Before we married, Mommy served in the WACS in the Philippines."
Now, I heard the WACS recruited old maids for the war
But Mommy isn't one of those, I've known her all these years

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay!
Whatever happened to all this season's losers of the year?
Every time I got to thinking, "Where'd they disappear?"
When I woke up, Mom and Dad are rolling on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rolling, got my Kiss records out

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, ay, ay, ay!
Away, away, yeah

Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away, ay, ay!Embed
