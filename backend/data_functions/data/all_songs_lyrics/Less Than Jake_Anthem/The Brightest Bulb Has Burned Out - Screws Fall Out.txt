The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out / Screws Fall Out Lyrics

You told me that your twenty years
Have gone by much too fast
And you've been hoping this year will be
Better than the last
You said you've been waging a war
Against the loneliest of nights
With the strongest drinks and longest lines
It's not that big a surprise
That you're feeling more dead than alive
You're feeling more dead than alive

So I'll let you know
If you need somewhere to go
I'll be listening when you call
And I'll be there if you fall off
If you need someone to believe in you
I'll let you know I will

You said that the hole in your head has gotten
Bigger than the hole that's in your chest
And you're stuck between the past and present tense
You said you've been waging a war
Against so many years of lies
With stronger drinks and longer lines
It's not that big a surprise
That you're feeling more dead than alive
You're feeling more dead than alive
So I'll let you know
If you need somewhere to go
I'll be listening when you call
And I'll be there if you fall off
If you need someone to believe in you
I'll let you know I will
I'll let you know I will
I'll let you know I will

But sometimes...


You gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go!

So this pen is starting to become
A pipe bomb, and these songs
Have turned to anthems again
To everything that's changed
And to everything that's gone away
Here's my condolences
To the future I never met
It's gone and never coming back
It's not coming back
So don't hold on to your past
You gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go!

'Cause friends leave as time fades away
The people and the places along the way
Without a doubt
Yeah, screws fall in and screws, they fall out

Tomorrow's gone up in smoke
And I wonder when I'm alone
Where'd my convictions go?
So to everyone that's gone away
Or fades away or stays the same
Here's my apologies
To the person that I used to be
Before I burned down every bridge
And every inch of everything I used to know

I gotta let it go!
Gotta let it go!

'Cause friends leave as time fades away
The people and the places along the way
Without a doubt
Yeah, screws fall in and screws, they fall out
Friends leave as time fades away
The people and the places along the way
So don't hold on to your past
No, it's never coming back
(You gotta let it go!)
'Cause friends leave as time fades away
The people and the places along the way
(You gotta let it go!) Without a doubt
Yeah, screws fall in and screws fall out

Friends leave as time fades away
The people and the places along the way
Without a doubt
Yeah, screws fall in and screws fall out
Without a doubt
Yeah, screws fall in and screws fall out
Without a doubt
Yeah, screws fall in and screws fall out
Without a doubt
Yeah, screws fall in and screws fall out
Without a doubt
Yeah, screws fall in and screws, they fall outEmbed
