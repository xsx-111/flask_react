The Dark End of the Street Lyrics
At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness, to hide our wrong, you and me
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me

I know that time is gonna take it's toll
We gonna pay for the love we stole
Ah, it's a sin and we know that it's wrong
Ah, but our love keeps coming on strong, you and me
At the dark end of the street
Just you and me

They're gonna find us, they're gonna find us
They're gonna find us someday
We steal away to the dark end of the street
Just you and me

If you take a walk downtown
And you find some time to look around
If you should see me and I walk on by
Oh, darling please don't cry, tonight we'll meet

At the dark end of the street
Just you and me, oh you and me
Oh, God, you and meEmbed
