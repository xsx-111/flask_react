Umbrella LyricsYou can turn the city upside down if you want to
But it won't keep you dry
You can turn the city upside down
Like an umbrella but it won't keep you dry
When you wrap yourself in a highway strip
Don't expect any warmth from it
All it is is cold cement
You can turn the city upside down
Like an umbrella but who knows what you'll find
Be careful if you try
You can turn the city upside down if you want to
But it won't keep you dry
(Keep you dry, Keep you dry, Keep you dry...)Embed
