Suddenly Is Sooner Than You Think LyricsI carry it, your body
From the freeway
I cried as if my tears
Would bring you back to me
The sirens followed close behind
But they were too late
Deserved to drown
The last words
Then you whispered;
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think
Suddenly is soon...
...sooner than you think
Outside, under, a road
Backwards, into, the ground
Miss you
Down, down
Miss you
Down, down
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you think
Suddenly is soon, sooner than you thinkEmbed
