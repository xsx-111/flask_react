(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan LyricsIt was familiar to me
The smoke too thick to breathe
The tile floors glistened
I slowly stirred my drink
And when you started to sing
You spoke with broken speech
That I could not understand
And then you grabbed me tightly:
"I won't let go, I won't let go
Even if you say so, oh no
I've tried and tried with no results
I won't let go, I won't let go"
He then played every song from 1993
The crowd applauded as
He curtsied bashfully
Your eyelashes tickled my neck
With every nervous blink
And it was perfect
Until the telephone started ringing, ringing, ringing
Ringing, ringing offEmbed
