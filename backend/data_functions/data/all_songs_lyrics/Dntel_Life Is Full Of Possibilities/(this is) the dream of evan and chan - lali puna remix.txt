(this is) the dream of evan and chan - lali puna remix LyricsIt was familiar to me, the smoke too thick to breathe
The tile floors glistened; I slowly stirred my drink
And when you started to sing, you spoke with broken speech
That I could not understand, and then you grabbed me tightly
I won't let go, I won't let go. Even if you say so, oh no
I've tried and tried with no results. I won't let go, I won't let go
He then played every song from nineteen ninety three
The crowd applauded as he curtsied bashfully
Your eyelashes tickled my neck with every nervous blink
And it was perfect until the telephone started
Ringing ringing ringing ringing ringing off...Embed
