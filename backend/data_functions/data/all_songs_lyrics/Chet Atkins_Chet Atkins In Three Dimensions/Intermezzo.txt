Intermezzo LyricsIn your dreams
In your dreams, a nightingale begins to sing
A twitterpated song
I appear, and then, my dear, you know, at last
Your love has come along
Maybe so, but yes, or no, a while ago
That birdie sang for me
And i just now begin to hope that i'm in your dreams
This is just the intermezzo
Of that moment that we met
So grand, the mem'ry lingers yet
So why let it go?
In my dreams, a nightingale, the one i sent
To sing for you a song
Reappears, with glowing ears, from words he hears
That you have sent along
We shall see how that may be
When next we meet again
As we go, dream-to-dream, to be there then
As it were, -- in your dreamsEmbed
