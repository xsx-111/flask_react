Sugar Lyrics
If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

We get the signal to leave you alone
And that's where we'll leave you, and that's where we'll find you

If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

We get the signal to leave you alone
And that's where we'll leave you, and that's where we'll find you
If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?

We get the signal to leave you alone
And that's where we'll leave you, and that's where we'll find you

If I give you sugar would you give me
Something elusive and temporary?1Embed
