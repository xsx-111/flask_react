All the Way... LyricsThey heard the sound of the snow falling
They left the house and started running
They ran past the street where they fluffed their lines
Where chemistry's slowly redesigned
All the way, the calendar froze on even number
Cat caught the tones of the cold caller
All the way, they could see it going
All the way
Is temperature Fahrenheit's sanction
A transparent cell mapping distraction
All the way, it would be forever
All the way
All the way, they heard the sound of the snow falling
They left the house and started running
I will let you know when it's time to be leaving
Don't want the same ghosts for company this evening
You come here and I disappear
Somehow I see something I fear
Maybe we'll make someone a souvenir
All the way, they heard the sound of the snow fallingEmbed
