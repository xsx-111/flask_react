Whitelightgenerator Lyrics
Live like our own video
What luck to have another turn
High in Victorian England
Away from the smoke and the fire

The mirror you'll see
Has a memory, special feature

It's falling on you from above
The walker is under the cloud
Out sound like a two minute warning
Falling on you from above

The mirror you'll see
Has a memory, special feature

The picture you'll see, infatuates me
The mirror you'll see, has a memory

Sisters when hit by the lightning
Wouldn't we talk under these
The mirror you'll see
Has a memory, special feature

The picture you'll see, infatuates me
The mirror you'll see, has a memory, special featureEmbed
