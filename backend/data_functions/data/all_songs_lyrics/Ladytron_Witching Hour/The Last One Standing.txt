The Last One Standing Lyrics
Merging the way
That we did yesterday, wrong direction
The traffic we'll know
The traffic is slow and thoughtless
The wheel that is still
On the concrete and green, away home
And it is alone
A division unknown, a split decision

Climbing the floors and I'm not running
Through revolving doors and you're not driving
The barrier stands between your hands and me
Sorry

You said I made
You said, you said I made a bad decision
You said I've made a mistake, fatal without recognition
But how would I know
Know of that consequence, had I foreseen
I kiss you in vain, how California hates, had I not been

Closing the doors and I am running
Past video stores and you are driving
A battery stands between your hands and me
Sorry
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing

You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing

You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standing
You have got to be the last one standingEmbed
