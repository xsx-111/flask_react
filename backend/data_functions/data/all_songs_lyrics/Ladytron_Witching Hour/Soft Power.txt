Soft Power Lyrics
Broken glass is luxury
Friendly fires are alchemy

Daylight is the enemy
Witching hour, soft power

We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills for us

Close your eyes so you're not seen
In valentine's daydream

We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills (witching hour) for us (soft power)

The arrogance of the forests
Setting fire to the tourists
We're not sleeping at the wheel
The wheel is turning the machine
That kills (witching hour) for us (soft power)


Broken glass is luxury
Friendly fires are alchemy

Daylight is the enemy
Witching hour, soft powerEmbed
