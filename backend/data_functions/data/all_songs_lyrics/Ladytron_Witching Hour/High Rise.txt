High Rise Lyrics
Black sun rising
New day dawning
Amplifying and destroying

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

Tender talons
Chase new horizons
Masquerading
Black sun rising

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

Silent movers
Black medusa
Perfect timing
Hallow morning

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise
Signals fading
Darkness falling
New day dawning
Black sun rising

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunrise

We're on the same high you and I
Open on the same page, no sunriseEmbed
