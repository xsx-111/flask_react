International Dateline Lyrics
Woke up in the evening
To the sound of screaming
Through the walls it was bleeding
All over me

Untied and weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here


Grown tired of the show coast
And the ones that we toast
There are already zeroes
Around here

Untied and weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave it here
Let's end it here

Woke up in the evening
To the sound of screaming
Through the walls it was bleeding
All over me

Untied and weightless
Unconscious as we cross
The international dateline
Let's end it here

Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave it here
Let's leave it here

Let's end it here
Let's end it here
Let's leave it here
Let's leave it hereEmbed
