Beauty*2 Lyrics
I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not laughing now
Loneliness a guarantee

I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not laughing now
He's not coming home to me

I sent you out to play last night
The alarms went off at three
Funny how I'm not laughing now
He's not coming home to me

Try to get out of the lease
And to move out of love
If only there was no consequence
I'd watch it all turn to dust

Hey can I go with you, my beauty number 2?
Hey can I go with you, when the rendezvous's over?
It's over
Hey can I go with you, my beauty number 2?
Hey can I go with you, when the rendezvous's over?

Hey can I go with you, my beauty number 2
My beauty number 2, his beauty number...
Hey can I go with you, when this rendezvous's
When this rendezvous's, when the rendevous's...
When the rendevous's over
It's not over, no, it's not overEmbed
