Weekend Lyrics
When they come out to find you
And they cannot describe you
Someone somewhere has to buy you out of your weekend

And Friday is the fever
And Monday the destroyer
You are a permanent feature, perpetual weekend

And on the wire in the morning
There's a city growing in my head
Where there is no weekend

When they come out to find you
And they can multiply you
Someone's been caught in the crossfire of your weekend

And Friday is the teacher
And Monday the tormentor
You are a new kind of creature, perpetual weekend

And on the wire in the morning
There's a city growing in my head
Where there is no weekend
You took the end
You took the end
You took the end
You took the end out of the weekend

You are a permanent feature
You are a new kind of creature

You took the end
You took the end
You took the end
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekend
You took the end out of weekendEmbed
