AMTV Lyrics
Films will come and films will go
That kiss on your neck won't show

Posing at the same place everytime
When you're still speaking in the sunshine

Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Staring at the bathroom floor
Please don't say you've got to go

Posing at the same place to put things right
In your eyes, we're meeting in the morning light

You've done it again, you've done it before
That kiss on your neck won't show

Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Staring at the bathroom floor
Please don't say you've got to go
Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Loose change from your pocket on the floor
Please don't say you've got to go

Cheap thrills that this time might last
Cheap thrills that you'll dream about

You've done it again, you've done it before
That kiss on your neck won't show

Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Staring at the bathroom floor
Please don't say you've got to go

Watching T.V. at 4 am
But that's not when she needs a friend
Loose change from your pocket on the floor
Please don't say you've got to goEmbed
