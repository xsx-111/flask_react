I Have Seen the Rain Lyrics
This next song is called "I Have Seen The Rain" and it was written by my daddy, Mr. Jim Moore. He wrote it back in Vietnam about 40 years ago, and I grew up singing it with him at different Vietnam Vet functions. It's how I learned to harmonize and how to love an acoustic guitar, and the way that we recorded it; it was my Dad's first time in a recording studio, and he always said, "singers don't really have to work too hard" - and he changed his mind that day. But we did it live, him and I in the vocal booth together, him playing and singing and me harmonizing. One take, straight through. It was a really, really good time, it was really special to be able to record a song with my Dad, the first song I ever learned. We hope you like it and we dedicate it to all the Vets out there

I have seen the rain
I have felt the pain
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
I don't know where I'm going
I don't even know where I've been
But I know, I'd like to see them again

Spend my days just searching
Spend my nights in dreams
Stop looking over my shoulder, baby
I've stopped wondering what it means
Drop out, burn out, soldier home
Oh, they've said I should've been more
Probably so if I hadn't of been in that crazy damn Vietnam war

I have seen the rain
I've survived the pain
Oh, I've been home 30 years or so
And I'm just stepping off of the plane
Spend my days just searching
Spend my nights in dreams
Stop looking over my shoulder, baby
I've stopped wondering what it means
Drop out, burn out, soldier home
Oh, they've said I should've been more
Probably so if I hadn't of been in that crazy damn Vietnam war

We have seen the rain, together
We've survived the pain, forever
Oh, it's good to home again
It's good to be with my friends
Oh, it's good to be home again
It's good to feel that rain1Embed
