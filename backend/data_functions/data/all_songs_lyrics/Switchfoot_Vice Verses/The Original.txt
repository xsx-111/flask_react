The Original Lyrics
Got your hands in your pockets
Like you’re ready to pay
Got your eyes out of socket
Like you’re a mile away
Mouth shut like a locket
Like you’ve nothing to say

Speak your mind up
Come on baby free yourself

Ain’t no one to do it
Free yourself
Ain’t nothing to it
Free yourself
Yeah, don’t let nobody try and steal your soul
You’re the original

So you say you’re just a lost soul
I know you better than that
So you say you’re just lost in the wash
I know you better than that
So you say you’re just a face in city race
Wasted and sick of it all
Speak your mind up
Come on baby free yourself

Ain’t no one to do it
Free yourself
Ain’t nothing to it
Free yourself
Yeah, don’t let nobody try and steal your soul
You’re the original

The original
You're the original
The original

Alright
Oh!
Come on now!
Oh!
Come on now!
Oh!
Come on now!
Oh!
Yeah!
Ain’t no one to do it
Free yourself
Ain’t nothing to it
Free yourself
Yeah, don’t let nobody try and steal your soul
You’re the original
Ain’t no one to do it
Free yourself
Ain’t nothing to it
Free yourself
Yeah, don’t let nobody try and steal your soul
You’re the originalEmbed
