Rise Above It LyricsAnother couple kids with their heads on top
Just another stranger just another plot
Another track home where the city streets stop
Just another kid with another bored cop
Just another lemon into lemonade job
Just another rust and dust facade
Just another key stuck broken in the lock
Just another scarecrow choking on a cough
Oh come on!
It all feels so typical
Guess I'm looking for a miracle
Rise above it
Rise above it
Don't care what they're telling me
We can be what we want to be
Rise above it
Rise above it
Listen up loud, listen up, listen here
Just because you're running
Doesn't mean that you're scared
Just because it's law don't mean it is fair
Never let another tell your soul what to fear
Here we go again, give it one more try
Don't believe the system's on your side
Just another lover turned enemy fight
Just another blood and nicotine sky
Oh come on!
It feels so typical
Guess I'm looking for a miracle
Rise above it
Rise above it
I get so sick of it
It feels so counterfeit
I rise above it
Rise above it
Hear our voices rise
Hear our battle cry
We've been under the curse
With our arms raised high
Hear us sing tonight
Like the last night on earth
We will rise like the tide
Like dead men
Coming back to life
We are rising
Rising
Turn it up now, listen loud and clear
Just because you're present doesn't mean that you're here
Oh come on!
It feels so typical
Guess I'm looking for a miracle
Rise above it rise above it
The curse is spoken
The system's broken
Rise above it
Rise above it
Let's rise above it
(Rise above it)
We can rise above it
(Rise above it)
Let's rise above it, yeah
Rise above it
(Rise above it)
Let's rise above itEmbed
