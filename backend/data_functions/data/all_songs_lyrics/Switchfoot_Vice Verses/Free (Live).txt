Free (Live) LyricsI've got my back against the wall
But I can still hear the blue sky call
The chains that hold me back inside
Are the prisons of my mind, yeah
Free, come set me free, down on my knees
I still believe you can save me from me
Come set me free, come set me free
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
I try to live the light of day
Why would I do what I hate?
But when try to reach above
I only I hurt the ones I love, yeah
Free, come set me free, down on my knees
I still believe you can save me from me
Come set me free, come set me free
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
There's a hole in the neighborhood where the shadows fall
There's a hole in my heart but my hope is not in me at all
I had a dream that my chains were broken, broken, broken
Open
Free, come set me free, down on my knees
I still believe you can save me from me
Come set me free, I still believe
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
Inside this shell there's a prison cell
Inside this shell there's a prison cellEmbed
