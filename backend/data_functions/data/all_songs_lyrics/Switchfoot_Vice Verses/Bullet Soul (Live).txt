Bullet Soul (Live) LyricsI wanna sing one for all the dreamers
I'm singing this one for the sparks
Here's one for the friction makers
We are the bleeding hearts
Don't care whoever you are
We rise and fall together
Our hearts still beat below
You can't stand by forever
You're a kid with a bullet soul
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
I wanna turn up the radiation
I wanna glow in the dark
Love is the one true innovation
Love is the only art
Don't let 'em blow it apart
We rise and fall together
Our hearts still beat below
You can't stand by forever
You're a kid with a bullet soul
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
We are the children of the scar
I wanna start from the start
We rise and fall together
Our hearts still beat below
You can't stand by forever
You're a kid with a bullet soul
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?
Are you ready to go?Embed
