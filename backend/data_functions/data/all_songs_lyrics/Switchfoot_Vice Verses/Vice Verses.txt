Vice Verses Lyrics
Walking along the high tide line
Watching the pacific from the sidelines
Wonder what it means to live together?
Looking for more than just guidelines
Looking for signs in the night sky
Wishing that I wasn't such a nice guy
Wonder what it means to live forever?
Wonder what it means to die?

I know that there’s a meaning to it all:
A little resurrection every time I fall
You got your babies, I got my hearses
Every blessing comes with a set of curses
I got my vices, got my vice verses
I got my vice verses

The wind could be my new obsession
The wind could be my next depression
The wind goes anywhere it wants to
Wishing that I learned my lesson
The ocean sounds like a garage band
Coming at me like a drunk man
The ocean telling me a thousand stories;
None of them are lies
I know that there’s a meaning to it all:
A little resurrection every time I fall
You got your babies, I got my hearses
Every blessing comes with a set of curses
I got my vices, got my vice verses
I got my vice verses

Let the pacific laugh
Be on my epitaph
With it's rising and falling and after all
It's just water and I am just soul
With a body of water and bone
Water and bone

Where is God in the city life?
Where is God in the city light?
Where is God in the earthquake?
Where is God in the genocide?
Where are You in my broken heart?
Everything seems to fall apart
Everything feels rusted over
Tell me that You're there
I know that there’s a meaning to it all:
A little resurrection every time I fall
You got your babies, I got my hearses
Every blessing comes with a set of curses
I got my vices, got my vice verses
I got my vice verses4Embed
