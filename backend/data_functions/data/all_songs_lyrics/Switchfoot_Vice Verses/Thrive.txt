Thrive Lyrics
Been fighting things that I can’t see in
Like voices coming from the inside of me and
Like doing things I find hard to believe in
Am I myself or am I dreaming?

I’ve been awake for an hour or so
Checking for a pulse but I just don’t know
Am I man when I feel like ghost?
The stranger in the mirror is wearing my clothes

No, I’m not alright
I know that I’m not right
A steering wheel don’t mean you can drive
A warm body don’t mean I’m alive
No, I’m not alright
I know that I’m not right
It feels like I travel but I never arrive
I want to thrive, not just survive

I come alive when I hear you singing
But lately I haven’t been hearing a thing and
I get the feeling that I’m in between
A machine and a man who only looks like me
I try and hide it and not let it show
But deep down inside me I just don’t know
Am I man when I feel like a hoax?
The stranger in the mirror is wearing my clothes

No, I’m not alright
I know that I’m not right
A steering wheel don’t mean you can drive
A warm body don’t mean I’m alive
No, I’m not alright
I know that I’m not right
It feels like I travel but I never arrive
I want to thrive, not just survive

I’m always close but I’m never enough
I’m always in line but I’m never in love
I get so down but I won’t give up
I get slowed down but I won’t give up

Been fighting things that I can’t see in
Like voices coming from the inside of me and
Like doing things I find hard to believe in
Am I myself or am I dreaming?
Am I myself or am I dreaming?
Am I myself or am I dreaming?
Thrive
No, I’m not alright
I know that I’m not right
A steering wheel don’t mean you can drive
A warm body don’t mean I’m alive
No, I’m not alright
I know that I’m not right
It feels like I travel but I never arrive
I want to thrive, not just survive

I want to thrive not just survive
I want to thrive not just survive
Feels like I travel but I never arrive
I want to thrive not just survive1Embed
