Mess of Me (Live) LyricsI am my own affliction
I am my own disease
There ain't no drug that they could sell
There ain't no drug to make me well
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
It's not enough
The sickness is myself
I've made a mess of me
I wanna get back the rest of me
I've made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I've made a mess of me
I wanna get back the rest of me
I've made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
The rest of my life alive
We lock our souls in cages
We hide inside our shells
It's hard to free the ones you love
When you can't forgive yourself
Yeah, forgive yourself
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
The sickness is myself
I've made a mess of me
I wanna get back the rest of me
I've made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I've made a mess of me
I wanna reverse this tragedy
I've made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
The rest of my life alive
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
There ain't no drug
No drug to make me well
There ain't no drug
It's not enough
I'm breaking down
The sickness is myself
The sickness is myself
I've made a mess of me
I wanna get back the rest of me
I've made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
I've made a mess of me
I wanna reverse this tragedy
I've made a mess of me
I wanna spend the rest of my life alive
The rest of my life aliveEmbed
