Dark Horses Lyrics
I’ve made my mistakes
I’ve seen my heart cave in
I got my scars
I’ve been to hell and back again
Born for the blue skies
We’ll survive the rain
Born for the sunrise
We’ll survive the pain

We’re singing
Hey, you can’t count us out
We’ve been running up against the crowd
Yeah, we're the Dark Horses
We’re singing
Wait! It’s not over now
We’ve been down but we’ve never been out
Yeah, we're the Dark Horses

We found a way out
The city takes everything it can
But outside the crowds
I can feel my lungs again
Born for the blue skies
We’ll survive the rain
Born for the sunrise
We’ll survive the pain

We’re singing
Hey, you can’t count us out
We’ve been running up against the crowd
Yeah, we're the Dark Horses
We’re singing
Wait! It’s not over now
We’ve been down but we’ve never been out
Yeah, we're the Dark Horses
We’re singing
La la-la-la-la-la-la
La la-la-la-la-la-la

Born for the blue skies
Born for the blue skies
Born for the sunrise
We’ll survive the pain
We’re singing
Hey, You can’t count us out
We’ve been running up against the crowd
Yeah, we're the Dark Horses
We’re singing
We don’t care what they say
We know we’ll find a way
Yeah, we're the Dark Horses
La la-la-la-la-la-la
La la-la-la-la-la-la

Keep running with the dark horses
Hope makes the blood change courses
Keep running with the dark horses
Stand up for the dark horses
Keep running with the dark horses
Hope makes the blood change courses
Keep running with the dark horses5Embed
