Red Eyes (Live) LyricsWhat are you waiting for?
The day is gone?
I said I'm waiting for dawn
What are you aiming for
Out here alone?
I said I'm aiming for home
Holding on, holding on
With red eyes
What are you looking for?
With red eyes
Red eyes
All of my days are spent
Within this skin
Within this cage that I'm in
Nowhere feels safe to me
Nowhere feels home
Even in crowds, I'm alone
Holding on, I'm holding on
With red eyes
What are you looking for?
With red eyes
Red eyes
(2x)
Every now and then I see you dreaming
Every now and then I see you cry
Every now and then I see you reaching
Reaching for the other side
What are you waiting for?
With red eyes
What are you looking for?
With red eyes
Red eyes
(2x)
In this needle and haystack life
I've found miracles there in your eyes
It's no accident we're here tonight
We are once in a lifetime
We are once in a lifetime
Alive
We are once in a lifetimeEmbed
