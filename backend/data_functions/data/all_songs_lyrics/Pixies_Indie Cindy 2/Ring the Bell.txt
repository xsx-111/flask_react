Ring the Bell Lyrics
Ring the bell
Ring the bell
Load your dhoni
Some cowrie shell
Hear the knell
Hear the knell
My heart is empty
Here come the swells

I've been away a long time
And though I've had some good times
I would have payed a crore
To see The Garland once more
I've been up here a long time
And now I see it's high time
To see The Garland once more
To walk with you there once more


I've been up here a long time
And now I see it's high time
To see The Garland once more
To walk with you there once more
I've been away a long time
And though I've had some good times
I would have payed a crore
To see The Garland once more
