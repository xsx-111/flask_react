What Goes Boom Lyrics
Fatty had it made like a blade in the sun
Like a push in the bush when you got none
Ping pong bingo, fills a la Ringo
Analog bong but it ring wrong

Make some room
What goes boom?

I'm a fatty in my caddy with my 'ponic blunt
Not a stunted runt looking natty
Cozy as a manger, Chet Baker in the changer
Subs for my dub, I really got you


Grace in her lace and her stocking
Carrying her bass, she really likes to get rocking
Oh, darling Grace, are we going to get rocking?

I like that slinky little punky, little bit funky
Itty bitty chunky right there
Little bit lippy, a whipped cream hippie
Zip and unzippy and I want her
