Noise Lyrics
What do you want me to do now?
You say you can see through me
I sit alone, looking down
You sit alone on your throne
Down your back, you want me to stroll
Up your legs, you want me to hold
In your arms to hear all the sound
Our hearts beat now but it's only noise

To move it over
To turn to stone
To pull the sword out of my bone
Our love calls through the door
Our love
There is no sound
It's only noise
It's only noise
It's only noise

I heard your voice, it's out of tune
My thoughts gone, steeplechasing the moon
I heard you say that I didn't hear
I like the way you fix your hair
What do you want me to do now?
You say you can see through me
I sit alone, looking down
You sit alone on your throne
Down your back, you want me to stroll
Up your legs, you want me to hold
In your arms to hear all the sound
Our hearts beat loud but it's only noise

To move it over
To turn to stone
To pull the sword out of my bone
Our love calls through the door
Our love
There is no sound
It's only noise
It's only noise
It's only noise
It's only noise
It's only noise

It's only noise
It's only noise
It's only noise
It's only noiseEmbed
