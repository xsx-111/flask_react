Hey Day LyricsGolden hills, you climb high
At the top, licking hairy pie
Skip Jack got a lucky hand
Living on the fat of the land
New roads travel smooth
No golden rule
No golden rule
I'll wait for you
No war and trade
I'll wait for you
The hope you're paid
I like your style
You go for charm
I like your hope
Sit golden on a lawn
Sit golden on a lawn
Well, I'm not damned
In the fat of the land
With the lucky hand
I can only dream
That you were forever racing
I can only dream
Hey day, hey day
Gone astray
Hey day, hey day
Hey day now
Hey dayEmbed
