Tiger Trap LyricsWhat's forbidden is a treasure hidden
I got a clue on the trail of finding all about you
Ask for trouble
A piece of the puzzle
Then I saw you
So many locks and keys and chains shield you
Two hearts crash insides against
When the suffering does commence
Jolly Roger run up the mast
And the sentence of love is passed
What's forbidden has been boldly bitten
I found you
Bitter tasting core of the sweetest fruit
Confusion reigns supreme when bad promises are redeemed
Tender hook of the tiger trap
Lost on the edge of a treasure map
Cover the wicked days with the scent of the sweet bouquet
The spoils of love renew
Still on the trail of finding all about you
Once forgiven but never written
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you
When I saw you1Embed
