Sleepy Head LyricsBad dreams are making me cry
Brush that sand from your eye
Get you up and out on the dry
So many things we never tried to do
We can make them true
So get out your sleepy head
It's time to make the bed
At least get partially dressed
Lift a finger to quell my unrest
I've waited too long trying to get through to you
We can make it all true
Lift your head off of the bed
Don't worry about which side
They both lead away from the night
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
Wake up your sleepy head
See a bloody finger scratch
Lift out of that sun trap
Wake up and come and stretch
Lead a march through fields of hay
They're all following you anyway
Wanna make a day into something new
We can make it all true
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
Wake up your sleepy head
Lift your head off of the bed
Don't worry about which side
They both lead away from the night
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
You're just a sleepy head
Wake up your sleepy head
Wake up your sleepy head
Wake up your sleepy head
Wake up
Your sleepy headEmbed
