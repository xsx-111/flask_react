Bury the Hammer LyricsWhen they're gone and the heart is pumping cold
Another burnt offering in worship of the toll
Paid at way stations along a lonesome road
Kick the stirrup and ride an empty soul
Kiss and forget is how it began
Peaches and photos, love letter in the sand
Empty buildings in an empty town
Knock the hollow life and make a hollow sound
A promise of a holiday and you can't travel
Scrapped and clawing, knocked out of the saddle
Forgive and forget
It's time to make amends
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Forgive and forget
Its time to make amends
You smile that it's okay
You turn and walk away
How many times can you start again?
For the pleasure of light and kisses on the wind
When you love another one, but you can't have 'em
Bleak sunshine makes you sadden
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Forgive and forget
It's time to make amends
There is no one
There is no one
There is no one
There is no one
There is no one
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
Bury the hammer
