Godsend LyricsIt's just the things you do
You make it true
It's just the things you do
You make it true
You wanna run and play
You make a sunny day
You wanna run and play
You make a sunny day
You wanna have a look
You open every book
You wanna have a look
You open every book
It's just the things you do
You make it true
(You're a godsend)
It's just the things you do
You make it true
(You're a godsend)
You stay up every night
Awash in candlelight
You stay up every night
Awash in candlelight
It's just the things you do
You make it true
It's just the things you do
You make it true
You're a godsend
You're a godsend
You're a godsend
You're a godsend
(Godsend)
See a man on the street
You wash his tired feet
See a man on the street
You wash his tired feet
It's just the things you do
You make it true
See a man on the street
You wash his tired feet
See a man on the street
You wash his tired feet
See a man on the street
You wash his tired feet
You're a godsend
Godsend (godsend)
(Godsend)
(Godsend)
It's just the things you do
You make it true
You're a godsend
It's just the things you do
You make it true
You're a godsend
You're a godsend
You're a godsend
You're a godsend
You're a godsend (godsend)
You're a godsend (godsend)
You're a godsend (godsend)
You're a godsend (godsend)
You're a godsend
Godsend
You wanna run and play
You make a sunny day
You wanna have a look
You open every book
You stay up every night
Awash in candlelight
You stay up every night
Awash in candlelight
See a man on the street
You wash his tired feet
You wanna rest your head
You make a bed (you make a bed)
You wanna rest your head
You make a bed, you make a bed
You're a godsend

See a tear in your eye
You don't know why
