Pinebox Derby Lyrics
To hunt a witch, follow this plan:
Cut a switch and thrash the back of your hand
When your palms begin to itch
That's the scent that attracts a witch

She may come at you
You will never catch her
The pine box rock
When it starts rockin', seal it with a coffin
Yeah, the pine box rock
Pine box rock

To tempt your fate, trace a spellbound
Track the coven to their hallowed ground
Draw blood from your fingertip
Mix it with the essence of the sacred witch

You may find your hunted
Brewing in a cauldron
The pine box rock
When it starts rockin', seal it with a coffin
Yeah, the pine box rock
Pine box rock

To catch a witch, you must be bold
Stomach strong and attitude cold
Steel nerves that won't heed nature's call
Sharp witted and that's not all, yeah

She may come at you
You will never catch her
The pine box rock
When it starts rockin', seal it with a coffin
Yeah, the pine box rock

Take the dreaded trip
On a broomstick
Pine box rockEmbed
