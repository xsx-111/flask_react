Teenage Caveman Lyrics
Guitar starts spinning, rock and roll starts winning
We rise to the top, we're the cream of the crop
We make with the haircuts straight out of the past
We blast first, we blast last

Teenage caveman, rock, wood, skin and bones
It's the cry of the wild, we cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone

Got a strand of barbed wire twisted around my throat
Teenage caveman, blind and without any hope
Let's get primitive right now, down with the rocks and the dirt
Let's bang our heads girl, trade spit 'til it hurts

Teenage caveman, rock, wood, skin and bone
It's the cry of the wild, we cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
Woke to the sound of an angel rolling bones to the door
I can hear the flowers bloom, the gust of blood from the roar

Teenage caveman, rock, wood, skin and bones
It's the cry of the wild, we cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
We cry alone
AloneEmbed
