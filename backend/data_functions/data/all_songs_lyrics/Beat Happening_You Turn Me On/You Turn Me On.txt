You Turn Me On Lyrics
Back of the woods with the fire glowing
Behind the barn, burning slowly
Set the fire, set the timber
Burn it down to ash and cinder

Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Oh, you turn me on

Back of the house, down the steps
Under the cellar door, we crept
Brought the doors, brought the windows
Set a match to scarecrow tinder

Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
You turn me on
Out of my head
Out of my tree
Out of my stump, drip out of me

Burn down the house
Burn down the barn
Burning down the entire farm
Cross the fields, fallow garden
Watch the scarecrow, forever autumn

Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
You turn me on
When we're done, we'll keep our bargain
You and I, forever autumn
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
Turn me on, dead man
You turn me on
You turn me on
Turn me on, dead man1Embed
