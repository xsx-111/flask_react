In Your Lap Lyrics
The Arab Spring called to us all
The people win when the dictators fall
I heard a bang and an almighty crack
And I just want my face in your lap
The people sing when the warlords all burn
Do not feel sad, it's simply their turn
They tried to wipe us clean off the map
And I just want my face in your lap
I just want my face in your lap

I rescued you in so many ways
You're good for a laugh, that's all you can say
Summer is winter, and winter prevails
And I'm so tired of counting the days
I'm so tired of counting the days

The security force is always the worst
Government advised, they're spraying our eyes
They live to kill, and they love just to harm
And I'm dreaming of touching your armEmbed
