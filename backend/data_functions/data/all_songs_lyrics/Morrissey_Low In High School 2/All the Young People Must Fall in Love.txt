All the Young People Must Fall in Love Lyrics
Spend more on nuclear war if that's your chosen illusion
Incinerate innocent men and women and children
The kids around here have the best idea

They say presidents come, presidents go
But all the young people, they must fall in love
All the young people, they must fall in love
Presidents come, presidents go
And oh, look at the damage they do

They never stop talking, but they aren't allowed to say
They cannot say what they really mean
Do you ever say what you really mean?

Oh, presidents come, presidents go
All the young people must fall in love

So what's your to do? It's up to you

Presidents come, presidents go
And nobody remembers their name two weeks after they go
All the young people, they must fall in love
All the young people, they must fall in love
All the young people must fall in love, in love, in love, in love3Embed
