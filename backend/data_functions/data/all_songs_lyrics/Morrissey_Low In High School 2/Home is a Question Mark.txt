Home is a Question Mark Lyrics
I have seen many shores
I hug the land, but nothing more
Because I haven't met you
I've wined and I've dined
With everybody bogus music mogul
No sign of you
I've brushed and I've rubbed
Pressing palms, exuding charms
But never in arms

And that's why home is a question mark
Home is some place I dunno
Home is a question mark
Home is some place I dunno

I have been brave
Deep in every shaven cave
None were you
Another film on replay
This time, Hell with Guillaume Canet
For wingless me

And that's why home is a question mark
Home is some place I dunno
Home is a question mark
Home is some place I dunno

Home, is it just a word?
Or is it something you carry within you?
I'm happy just to be here
If I ever find home
If I ever find home
If I ever find home
If I ever find home

If I get there, would you meet me?
Wrap your legs around my face just to greet me?
If I ever get there, would you meet me?
Wrap your legs around my face just to greet me?
If I ever get there
Do you really think I will?
Do you really think I will?
Do you really think I will?
How many times I've saved myselfEmbed
