I Wish You Lonely Lyrics
I wish you lonely, if only for one day
So that you might see routine for me
Since the day I was born, born
Think of yourself only, of everything you demand
Or you want or you need
And to hell, to hell with everybody else, everybody else

Turn the key slowly
Remember how I can't sleep
Or if ever I do, an earthquake
An earthquake, oh, couldn't agitate, couldn't agitate

Tombs are full of fools who gave their life upon command
Of monarchy, oligarch, head of state, potentate
And now never coming back, never coming back
Tombs are full of fools who gave their life upon command
Of Romance gone wrong, the same old glue
And never coming true, never coming true
Tombs are full of fools who gave their life upon command
Of heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin
And never coming back, never coming back
I wish you lonely like the last tracked humpback whale
Chased by gunships from Bergen, oh
But never giving in, never giving inEmbed
