Fool Lyrics
Tell me lies, slap me on the face
Just improvise, do something really clever
That'll make me hate your name forever
You might swear you'd never touch a lady
Well, let me say, you're not too far from maybe
Every day you find new ways to hurt me

But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
'Til the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, fool

God resigned from hearing my old story
Every night, I'm paying hell for glory
I'm embarrassed, but I'm much more sorry
All this pain begins to feel like pleasure
With my tears, you'd make a sea a desert
Salt my wounds and Iâ€™ll keep saying, "Thank you"

But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
'Til the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, fool

But I can't help it if I'm just a fool
Always having my heart set on you
'Til the time you start changing the rules
I'll keep chasing the soles of your shoes
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, fool
I can't help it, baby, ah-ah, fool
I can't help it, baby, ah-ah, fool
I can't help it, baby, ah-ah, fool
I can't help it, baby, baby, ah-ah-ah-ah, fool
I'm a fool
I'm a fool1Embed
