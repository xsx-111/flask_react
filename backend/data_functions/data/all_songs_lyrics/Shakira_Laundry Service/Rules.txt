Rules Lyrics
You have to swear you've got love to love me
Uh-uh, that will last forever
Uh-uh, we must have a story
Uh-uh, with a happy ending

Ahh, so don't ever go away, and never put aside
The things I'm gonna say, ‘cause these are rules for us

Use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh, only if you laugh with me
You can cry, only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Oh, can't you see?
You always were, you'll always be

You used to say I should see a doctor
Uh-uh, who would keep me busy
Uh-uh, ‘cause a jealous woman never makes it easy

Ahh, and you know I'll do for us whatever seems right
Ah-ah, but it may take awhile before I change the rules
Use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh only if you laugh with me
You can cry only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Oh, can't you see? You always were, you always were
Ohh, oh-oh-oh


So use your eyes only to look at me
Use your mouth only to kiss my lips
We are branches of the same old tree
You can laugh only if you laugh with me
You can cry only if you cry for me
Don't forget that you're condemned to me
Oh, can't you see? You always were, you'll always be
Ah-ah-ah1Embed
