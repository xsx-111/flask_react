Ready for the Good Times Lyrics
I don't wanna clear the cobwebs from my head
Time will bring them back, I bet
So if you hear me say that I believe in love
Don't make me feel ashamed
I used to sing the saddest songs
And in the meantime, roaches used to climb my door
Falling back down to the floor
I used to read survival guides
When my world was full of seven legged cats
But here I am with eight more lives

I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Now that I'm not alone
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, you know it
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You better not ignore it

I don't wanna look at fashion magazines
While someone does my nails
Sitting here watching other people live
Frozen by the fear to fail
'Cause every day there's a war to fight
And if I win or lose - nevermind
As long as you're my shelter every night
I used to cry against a wall
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
Swear to me you won't be gone

I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Now that I'm not alone


'Cause every day there's a war to fight
And if I win or lose - nevermind
As long as you're my shelter every night
I used to cry against a wall
But now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on
Swear to me you won't be gone
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Ready to get it on
I'm ready for the good times
I'm ready for the good times
Now that I'm not alone
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, you know it
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
You better not ignore it3Embed
