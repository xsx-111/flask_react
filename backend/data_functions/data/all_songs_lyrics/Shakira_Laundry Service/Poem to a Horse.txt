Poem to a Horse Lyrics
You're too far to bring you close
And too high to see below
Just hanging on your daily dose
I know you never needed anyone
But the rolling papers for your grass
How can you give what you don't have?

You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot
You start out playing with yourself
You get more fun within your shell
Nice to meet you, but I gotta go my way

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more

I'd rather eat my soup with a fork
Or drive a cab in New York
‘Cause to talk to you is harder work
So what's the point of wasting all my words
If it's just the same or even worse
Than reading poems to a horse? Oh
You keep on aiming for the top
And quit before you sweat a drop
Feed your empty brain with your hydroponic pot
I bet you'll find someone like you
‘Cause there's a foot for every shoe
I wish you luck but, I've got other things to do

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more


I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain
But you're so in love with yourself
If I say my heart is sore
Sounds like a cheap metaphor
So I won't repeat it no more2Embed
