The One Lyrics
So I find a reason to shave my legs each single morning
So I count on someone Friday nights to take me dancing
And then to church on Sundays
To plant more dreams
And someday think of kids
Or maybe just to save a little money

You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me, I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun

In a world full of strangers
You're the one I know

So I learned to cook and finally lose my kitchen phobia
So I've got the arms to cuddle in when there's a ghost or a muse
That brings insomnia
To buy more thongs
And write more happy songs
It always takes a little help from someone
You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me, I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun


You're the one I need
The way back home is always long
But if you're close to me, I'm holding on
You're the one I need
My real life has just begun
'Cause there's nothing like your smile made of sun
You're the one I need
You're the one I need
With you, my real life has just begun
You're the one I need
You're the one I need
Nothing like your smile made of sun
Nothing like your love
Nothing like your love, ah
Nothing like your love3Embed
