Who Is It? Lyrics
Who, who is it?
Who, who is it?
Who, who is it?
Who, who is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
Oh, baby, it's you!

Who, who is it?
Who, who is it?
Who, who is it?
Who, who is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
Oh, baby, it's you!

Watch out now, baby, 'cause I am in love with you
Watch out now, baby, 'cause I am in love with you
If you don't love me I don't know what I'm going to do
Who, who, who is it?
Who, who, who is it?
Who, who, who is it?
Who, who, who is it?
Who, who, who is it?
Who, who, who is it?
Who, who, who is it?
Who, who, who is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
Oh, baby, it's you!1Embed
