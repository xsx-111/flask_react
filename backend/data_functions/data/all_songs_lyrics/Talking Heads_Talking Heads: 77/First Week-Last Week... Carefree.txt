First Week/Last Week... Carefree Lyrics
Can we run that again
Is that a woman's voice I hear?
I said, "Let's wait and see. I'll see for myself"
That's a phrase I repeat
To myself
Made a reference to me and
That's myself too

What progress I have made the first week
First Week
First Week
First Week

Every sentence I use
Refer to women and their names
I heard, heard the voice first last week
I heard it myself
Made a reference to me and
That's myself
This report's incomplete
I can see for myself

Every appointment has been moved to last week
Last Week
Last Week
Last Week
I heard the voice first last week
I heard it myself
Made a reference to me
And that's myself
This report's incomplete
I can see for myself

Every appointment has been moved to last week
Last Week
Last Week
Last WeekEmbed
