Happy Day LyricsIn my sensations, I believe that I was
Born with the things that I know
I want to talk like I read
Before I decide what to do
And I fell all over and I couldn't stand up
I can't be critical, a heart won't stop
Such a happy day for me
Bring that happy day to me
Send that happy day to me
And that happy day came to me, come to me, here it comes
I'm only looking
Feel like my heart has a will of its own
I feel, feel nice inside
Right here
And now it's summer again
The story I told, the story I made up
I was foolin' around but a heart can't stop
Such a happy day for me
Bring that happy day to me
Send that happy day to me
And that happy day come to me, come to me, here it comes
This boy is in motion
Some density moved right beside me
I want my sentence
Right here
But now I'm far away
A sign was given but many years have passed
It cost a little bit to love you but a heart can't stop
Such a happy day for me
Bring that happy day to me
Send that happy day to me
And that happy day came to me, come to me, here it comes
It's alrightEmbed
