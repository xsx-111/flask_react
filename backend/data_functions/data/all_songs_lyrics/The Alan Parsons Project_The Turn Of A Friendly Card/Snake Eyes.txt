Snake Eyes Lyrics
Snake eyes
Seven eleven
Don't let me down boys
Gimme snake eyes
Seven eleven
Don't let me down tonight
No don't let me down tonight

Just one minute more
Give me just one minute more
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
Just one minute more
Then I'll walk right through that door
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
If ya gimme

Snake eyes
Seven eleven
Don't let me down now
Gimme snake eyes
Staring at heaven
Don't let me down tonight
No don't let me down tonight
Just one minute more
Gimme just one minute more
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright
But you gotta
Gimme one minute more
Gimme one minute more
It's gonna be alright, it's gonna be alright



Just one minute more
Then I'll walk right through that door
But'cha gotta
Gimme one more marker more
Then I'll walk right through that door
Gimme one more, don't let me down
It's gonna be alright, alright, alrightEmbed
