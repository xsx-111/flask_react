Pay It Back Lyrics
Stop, thief, you're gonna come to grief
If you don't take a little more care
You're gonna get more than the family plan
From this one shoestring affair
I may be crazy, but I can't contemplate
Being trapped between the doctor and the magistrate

One of these days, I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days
One of these days, I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days

And then, they told me I could be somebody
If I didn't let too much get in my way
And I tried so hard just to be myself
But I keep on fading away
And then the lights went out, I didn't know what to do
If I could fool myself, then maybe I'd fool you

One of these days, I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days
One of these days, I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days
I wouldn't say that I was raised on romance
Let's not get stuck in the past
I love you more than everything in the world
I don't expect that will last
They told me everything was guaranteed
Somebody somewhere must've lied to me

One of these days, I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days
One of these days, I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days

One of these days, I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these days
One of these days, I'm gonna pay it back
Pay it back one of these daysEmbed
