Sneaky Feelings Lyrics
Now everybody's breaking up somebody else's home
Before somebody else starts breaking up their own
I get you in my dreams
You should hear the things you say
It's not that it's so much fun
But it's safer that way

Sneaky feelings, sneaky feelings
You can't let those kind of feelings show
I'd like to get right through the way I feel for you
But I've still got a long way to go

Why don't we call it a day, and we can both confess
You can't force me to use a little tenderness
White lies, alibis, anything but say that it's true
Now we could sit like lovers, staring in each other's eyes
But the magic of the moment might become too much for you

Sneaky feelings, sneaky feelings
You can't let those kind of feelings show
I'd like to get right through the way I feel for you
But I've still got a long way to go
I've still got a long way to goEmbed
