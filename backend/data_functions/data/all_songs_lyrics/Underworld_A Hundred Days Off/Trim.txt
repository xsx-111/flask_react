Trim LyricsHe-he-heat in your skin, pull up a chair and unwind
Dog we don't share, the taxi left us behind
Silhouette of a psychic reader in the market
And the straw wrapped around a bottle to take home
Barbecue chicken oil in a drum, double strong wrong
Here comes the horn you call for
Woman in a box with her head in her box
Speaks French when spoken like a tourist French
Hey classic Coca-Cola in a can
When you wanna cool down
Heat, she move up the street in waves
Sugar, sugar, clear your mind, leave it all behind
Get in the boat and float, join in on a high spot
And ride, ride, put on some smile, stay for a while
Heat, she move up the street in waves
Sugar, sugar, clear your mind, leave it all behind
Get in the boat and float, join in on a high spot
And ride, ride, put on some smile, stay for a whileEmbed
