Sola Sistim LyricsMy eyes burn naked
My black cold numbers
My insecurities
My devious nature
Make it go away
My rest between rubber
My spider shadow
My shattered dancer
Beautiful, broken
My crystal fingers
Beautiful, broken
My crystal fingers
My glass like rain
My illumination
My cracks are sliding
Shaker, feather
Rubber, duster
Cold, cool
Your fingers, broken
Beautiful, wonderful
Paper flaps
How you love?
Love to love
Love and stitch
Shaker, rubber, striper
Beautiful, broken
My crystal fingers
Beautiful, broken
My crystal fingersEmbed
