Luetin LyricsI will give you very good time
Oh I'll give you very good time
If you come back to me
And I will give you white plastic chip
Make you, make you
Make you, make it, make me
Cool in my tomb
I will give you everything
Account invention
Vision vision vision vision
I will transform her feel it
Feel the fiber
Transformer
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
It's your name day
Two of the men I know
Had a name day
They were cold coffee
Selling names for boys
Selling names for girls
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
The sex and everything
The sex and everything
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
You can live after the first course of one
The cats go mad when you call
The smell of dogs when you call
Is it the black one, or the red one?
The cats go mad when you call
The smell of dogs when you call
Is it the black one, or the red one?
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
The sex and everything
The sex and everything
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
The guy sits in his smoky smoky hole all day
I think he is spicy
I think he smoked his lungs
The guy sits in his smoky smoky hole all day
I think he is spicy
I think he smoked his lungs
He just bite a little bite
He just bite a little bite
You want some more wet chicken
It tastes the same, it tastes the same
It tastes the same, it tastes the same
It tastes the same, it tastes the same
It tastes the same, it tastes the same
It tastes the same, it tastes the same
It tastes the same, it tastes the same
It tastes the same, it tastes the same
It tastes the same, it tastes the same
It tastes the same
All day
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
The sex and everything
The sex and everything
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
You can live after the first course of one
The cats go mad when you call
The smell of dogs when you call
Is it the black one, or the red one?
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
Get your own ends
Get your own endsEmbed
