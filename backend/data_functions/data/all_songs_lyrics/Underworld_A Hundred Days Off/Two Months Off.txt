Two Months Off Lyrics
There was a little drawing of a heart next to that
Followed by an exclamation mark
The back of his was covered in stuff stuff like
Brandon is not a very nice guy, but Alex is so nice
And that had the exclamation thing too
It was just silly crap that hit the spot
And he let himself be drawn in

You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in to a dark place
Walking in light, glowing walking in light
Gold ring around you, the hues of you
The golden sunlight of you
Cool wind following, following after you
Rising for you, your skin beautiful
Everything comes natural, fantastic fan
Rocking, rocking, floating

You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
Cool wind following, following after you
Rising for you, your skin beautiful
Everything comes natural, fantastic fan
Rocking, rocking, floating

There was a little drawing of a heart next to that
Followed by an exclamation mark
The back of his was covered in stuff stuff like
Brandon is not a very nice guy, but Alex is so nice
And that had the exclamation thing too
It was just silly crap that hit the spot
And he let himself be drawn in
It was just silly crap
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
You bring light in
Cool wind following, following after you
Rising for you, your skin beautiful
Everything comes natural, fantastic fan
Rocking, rocking, floatingEmbed
