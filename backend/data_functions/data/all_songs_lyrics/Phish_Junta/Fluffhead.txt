Fluffhead LyricsFluffhead was a man
With a horrible disease
Could not find no cure
Won't you help him if you please?
Fluffhead
Fluffhead
Fluff came to my door
Askin' me for change
His eyes were clear and pure
But his mind was so deranged
Fluffhead
Fluffhead
Fluff went to a banker
Askin' for some bills
The banker said, "I ain't got that
But I sure got some powerful pills"
Oh yeah
Fluffhead
