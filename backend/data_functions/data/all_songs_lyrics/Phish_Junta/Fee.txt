Fee LyricsIn the cool shade of the banana tree
On the rugged trail toward the balcony
A child of the twentieth century
A dried up Goliath and a weasel named Fee
Far away in another place
A fading beauty named Milly Grace
A gospel singer with pocks on her face
And a bamboo cane to help her keep the pace
Fee was a Buddhist prodigy
Long past the age of maturity
Someday he knew it would set him free
Like it did for Floyd the chimpanzee
Oh, Fee
You're trying to live a life that's completely free
You're racing with the wind, you're flirting with death
So have a cup of coffee and catch your breath
Whoa, Fee
You're trying to live a life that's completely free
You're racing with the wind, you're flirting with death
So have a cup of coffee and catch your breath
Fee first met Milly in a bar in Peru
His heart was jumping like a kangaroo
Like a beast in a cage in an old Dutch zoo
It was hopping and thumping in wooden shoes
But Floyd was jealous and alone
He wanted Milly for his own
A desperate craving in his bones
"Their love," he said, "I will not condone."
Then one day on a ship to Quebec
Floyd found Fee and Milly on a lover's trek
He picked up a bottle and broke off the neck
It sliced through the air and Fee hit the deck
Whoa, Fee
You're trying to live a life that's completely free
You want to stay with Milly until you're dead
But you just got a bottle upside the head
Whoa, Fee
You're trying to live a life that's completely free
You want to stay with Milly until you're dead
But you just got a bottle upside the head
Milly turned and began to scream
At Floyd, she said, "You think you're pretty mean"
And though she was as thin as a small string bean
She slammed him in the face with a nectarine
Floyd fell back over the edge of the ship
Till he hung from the rail by his fingertip
Milly said, "Floyd, I'll make you lose your grip
With this tiny piece of paper, I can make you slip"
So Milly took that paper and did the deed
Floyd hit the water with astonishing speed
And as the sharks circled in and began to feed
Milly knew her weasel was finally free
Whoa, Fee
You're trying to live a life that's completely free
Floyd is dead, he's nothing but a ripple
'Cause Milly took that paper and sliced him on the nipple
Whoa, Fee
You're trying to live a life that's completely free
Floyd is dead, he's nothing but a ripple
'Cause Milly took that paper and sliced him on the nipple
Whoa, Fee
You're trying to live a life that's completely free
You're racing with the wind, you're flirting with death
So have a cup of coffee and catch your breath
Whoa, Fee
You're trying to live a life that's completely free
You're racing with the wind, you're flirting with death
So have a cup of coffee and catch your breath1Embed
