Golgi Apparatus LyricsI look into the finance box
Just to check my status (status)
I look into the microscope
I see Golgi Apparatus
Golgi, oh, woe is me
You can't even see the sea
Golgi, olgi, oh ooo olgi
Golgi
Golgi
They call him Lysosome
'Cause he runs so fast
Runs like a junkyard dog
With a brain of brass
Golgi, oh, woe is me
You can't even see the sea
Golgi, olgi, oh ooo olgi
Golgi
Golgi
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you
Under the light, middle of the night
Couldn't get it wrong, so I had to
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you
Under the light, middle of the night
Couldn't get it wrong, so I had to
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you with a ticket stub in your hand
I saw you
Under the light, middle of the night
Couldn't get it wrong, so I had to
I look into the finance box
Just to check my status
I look into the microscope
I see Golgi Apparatus
Golgi, oh, woe is me
You can't even see the sea
Golgi, olgi, oh ooo olgiEmbed
