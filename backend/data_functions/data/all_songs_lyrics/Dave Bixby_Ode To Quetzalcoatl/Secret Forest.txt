Secret Forest LyricsWalking through the secret forest
Morning dew is everywhere
You come upon a sandy clearing
The wind plays gently with your hair
All the love that surrounds you
Must come from somewhere
Looking at the big blue sky
Could’ve come from there
I think I know
I think I know
The sun is right above the tree tops
It must be getting close to noon
I wish that I could stay forever
Being here is being in tune
Maybe I would find a good friend
And tell him of my walk today
And maybe he would come with me
And kneel down in the woods and pray
And we’d find out, and then we’d know
From the mighty heavens above
To shower us with His love
It is the Lord
It is the LordEmbed
