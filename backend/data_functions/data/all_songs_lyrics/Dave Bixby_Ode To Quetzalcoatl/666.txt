666 LyricsThe faith to move a mountain
The faith to destroy a fruitless tree
On faith I should be counting
To walk upon the endless sea
I will live to see
The Lord come to get His sheep
And it's up to me
His commandments I will keep
Until that day
Vapor coming from the sea
People want to torture me
Stars are falling from the sky
The moon's blood red and they wonder why
For it's written in the book
Disease and earthquake shake the ground
People cursing Him not kneeling down
For the time has come
Yes the time has come
When 666 will soon be bound
For a thousand years
And 666 will soon be bound
For a thousand years
Until that day
And we will live in harmony
And Jesus will rain upon the sea with loveEmbed
