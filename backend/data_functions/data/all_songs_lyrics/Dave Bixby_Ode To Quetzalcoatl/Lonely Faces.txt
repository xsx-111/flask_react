Lonely Faces LyricsI’ve just seen the faces of the people that I love
Something tragic's happened I just don’t know the nature of
I turned to give a helping hand
And they just could not understand my love
Something's got them by the mind
And will not let them see the signs I give
Every now and then one of them would turn and try to say
The words were on their lips but no sound ever came my way
They look so spaced out lost and lonely
Living in a dream that’s hell for them
Something’s got them by the mind
And will not let them see the signs I give
It's time to call on my God
To ask Him what could be done
Almighty, help them they cannot see
Won’t You show them the light that
You showed to me
They're looking at me
It's up to me nowEmbed
