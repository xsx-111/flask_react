Mother LyricsShe sang to me
When I was a little boy
On bended knee
All her love I could enjoy
But the years went by
I made her cry
It left her sad
To see me go bad
She wanted me
To have the better things
The songs she sang to me
No more she ever sings
And its sad
Oh mother dear how could I hurt you so
She tried to tell me
About Jesus and his love
I laughed at her
And said threes nothing up above
How little I did know
How much she loved me so
As the years went by
She learned how not to cry
How can I tell her
Old prayers have all come true
She gave up hope so long ago
And fell out of tune
Oh Jesus tell her I'm not lying any more
And I want to love her againEmbed
