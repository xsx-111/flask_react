Waiting For The Rains LyricsWaiting for the rains to come
And wash my tracks away
So no one can see where Iâ€™ve been
No one will know my way
Going to start all over again
Going to see it through
Going to make this dream of mine
Really come true
Going to leave some new tracks somewhere
And then watch them grow
So I can see where I have been
And not be afraid to know
Waiting for the rains to come
Waiting for the rainsEmbed
