I Have Seen Him LyricsI have seen him in the wind
I’ve touch the prints in his hands
And he looked me in the eye
We walked along that narrow path
And he told me things that must come to pass
And he told me things that must be done
So he can come
And he asked me to let him love me
Tell the world that he is still living
And weeping for us for we have pushed him aside
His glory filled my soul
And touch my heart so I would know
The powers I’ve been given
So if your are lost my friend
And trying to hide your fears
He will make us fishers of men
He’s been doing it for two thousand years
His glory will fill our souls and touch our hearts
So we would know the powers we’ve been given
Ah aha ahEmbed
