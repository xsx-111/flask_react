Drug Song LyricsLife use to be good
Now look what I’ve done
I’ve ruined my temple with drugs
My mind is stun
Cut down in my man hood
Before my time
Left in my darkness
I’ve lost my mind
I can't even think straight
Nobody knows what I say
Even my guitar
Wonders why I can’t play
No more a smile
I wear on my face
I’ve gone the last mile
And I’ve just lost the race
How did I get this way
Its so unreal
I’m no longer a person
I can’t even feel
Cut down in my manhood
Before my time
Lost in my darkness
I’ve lost my mind5Embed
