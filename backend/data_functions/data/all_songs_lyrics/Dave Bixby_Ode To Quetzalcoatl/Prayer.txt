Prayer LyricsWe will take to the sky
Together weâ€™ll fly
The wind is free
To float on the trees
Come across to me
We will visit the sea
And the words He will say
With His waves and His spray
Will fill our hearts with God
Have you noticed the sun
On the beach when you run
Let me tell you about His love
Say your prayers to the seas
Cast them off in the breeze
He will hear them He will hear them
You can be sure He will hear them
You can be sure
Pick out a cloud
And speak very loud
And that cloud
Will be yours forever
And these things are all free
For you and for me
'Cause He put them there
'Cause He put them there
Now that we've found You
We can work and live around You
We can forgive we can love we can liveEmbed
