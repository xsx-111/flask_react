Morning Sun Lyrics
The sun in the morning
Comes over the hill
And kisses the tall grass beside me

We are so young at heart
And living is an art
To be good at

We get our strength in the day time
By the sun's golden rays
That lasts us into the night time
We find ourselves in many ways

The sun in the morning
A new dayâ€™s a dawning
Look out your window
And see yourself walking
Through fields of love
And the sky up above
Is with you

Oh God we love you
How can we say?
We love you
We love you

How can these bodies say?Embed
