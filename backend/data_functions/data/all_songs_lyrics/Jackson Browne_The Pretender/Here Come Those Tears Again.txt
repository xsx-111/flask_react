Here Come Those Tears Again Lyrics
Here come those tears again
Just when I was getting over you
Just when I was going to make it through
Another night without missing you
Thinking I might just be strong enough after all
When I hear your footsteps echoing in the hall

Baby here we stand again
Where we've been so many times before
Even though you looked so sure
As I was watching you walking out my door
But you always walk back in like you did today
Acting like you never even went away

Well I don't know if I can
Open up and let you in baby
Here come those tears
Here come those tears again

I can hear you telling me
How you needed to be free
And you had some things to work out alone
Now you're standing here telling me
How you have grown
Here come those tears again (Don't know if I can)
Now you'll tell me how to hold them in (Open up and let you in)
Here come those tears
Here come those tears again

Some other time baby
When I'm strong and I'm feeling fine maybe
When I can look at you without crying
You might look like a friend of mine

But I don't know if I can
Open up enough to let you in
Here come those tears
Here come those tears again
(Don't know if I can)
Walk away
(Open up enough to let you in)
I'm going back inside and turning out the light
(Here come those tears)
And I'll be in the dark but you'll be out of sight
(Here come those tears again)

Don't know if I can
Open up, let you in baby
Here come those tears
Here come those tears againEmbed
