Your Bright Baby Blues Lyrics
Well I'm sittin' down by the highway
Down by that highway side
Everybody's goin' somewhere
Ridin' just as fast as they can ride
I guess they got a lot to do
Before they can rest assured
Their lives are justified
Pray to God for me, babe
He can let me slide

'Cause I've been up and down this highway
Far as my eyes can see
No matter how fast I run
I can never seem to get away from me
No matter where I am
I can't help thinkin' I'm just a day away
From where I wanna be
Now I'm runnin' home, baby
Like a river to the sea

Baby if you can see me
Out across this wilderness
There's just one thing
I was hopin' you might guess
Baby, you can free me
All in the power of your sweet tenderness
Yeah, yeah
Well I can see it in your eyes
You've got those bright baby blues
You don't see what you've got to gain
But you don't like to lose
You watch yourself from the sidelines
Like your life is a game you don't mind playin'
To keep yourself amused
I don't mean to be cruel, baby
But you're lookin' confused

Baby if you can hear me
Turn down your radio
There's just one thing
I want you to know
When you've been near me
I've felt the love
Stirrin' in my soul
Yeah, yeah, yes I have

It's so hard to come by
That feeling of peace
This friend of mine said
"Close your eyes
And try a few of these"
I thought I was flyin' like a bird
So far above my sorrow
But when I looked down
I was standin' on my knees
Now I need someone to help me
Someone to help me please
Baby if you need me
Like I know I need you
There's just one thing
I'll ask you to do
Take my hand and lead me
To the hole in your garden wall
And pull me through
Pull me through1Embed
