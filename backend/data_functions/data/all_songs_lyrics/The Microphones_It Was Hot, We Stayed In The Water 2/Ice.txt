Ice Lyrics
The heat came down and breathing got clear
(There was water in your hair)
The fog burned off and finally I felt near
(And the sun came out, we had to get back in)
To the place I'd like to stay
(Sunlight made reflections on your skin)
But the year went on and it got too cold to swim

So I stayed beneath as the water above me froze
From under the ice I saw you in warm clothes
And now I'm thawing out while the fire you made growsEmbed
