Karl Blau Lyrics
Blue moon
Waded out past the wave swells
Where we all floated helpless
And he told us to stop treading water
He sang about the sand
Where we could all touch our feet down
He held out his hand
With his head tipped back he sang loud

But we didn't listen, he swam off alone
Long live his words, all caught up on his own
He said someday the moon will reach out to the sun
But for now, it must drift along
But for now, he drifts aloneEmbed
