The Writhing South Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay

Searching for blood in the salty sea
The sun beating down on the chest and back of me
Looking for drugs in a Southern town
Hey, hey, hey-hey

I've got this red right hand that points me south
The puke green clouds just spat me out
Into the hot heartland I've landed with no shoes

I hear "Hey, hey-hey-hey; come pollinate me
Hey, hey-hey-hey; come pollinate me, hey"
Across the room, across the room
I hope to watch you writhe again soon
Across the room, across the room
I hope to watch you writhe again soon

All right
We're gonna do it again for you now
Okay, yeah, oh yeah, yeah!
They've got the army of ears
They canâ€™t hear you now
I got the piss in my veins
And these furrowed brows
You've got this one last chance
To burn me, turn me down

If not, I've got these last twelve bucks to spend on you
You can take me anywhere your sick mind wants to
Use yourself to fuel me using you

Oh, I hear "Hey, hey-hey-hey; come pollinate me
Hey, hey-hey-hey; come pollinate me, hey"
Across the room, across the room
I hope to watch you writhe again soon
Across the room, across the room
I hope to watch you writhe again soon


I hear "Hey, hey-hey-hey; come pollinate me
Hey, hey-hey-hey; come pollinate me, hey
Hey, hey-hey; come pollinate me"
Across the room, across the room
I hope to watch you writhe again soon
Across the room, across the room
I hope to watch you writhe again soon
I hope to watch you writhe again soon7Embed
