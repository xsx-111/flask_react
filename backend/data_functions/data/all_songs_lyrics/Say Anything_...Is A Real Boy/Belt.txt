Belt Lyrics
I have to record the spoken-word introduction to the record

Still?

Yeah. It's only a few lines, but I'm having anxiety about it

Do you know what it is?

Yeah, it goes—

Good, so you don't have to write it

It goes—

Oh, yeah, let me hear it

It goes, "And the record begins, with a song of rebellion."
...that's it?
And the record begins, with a song of rebellion!

I wouldn't sell my belt to industry
So they carded me, and they carted me off
Naked but that belt around my waist
It was my father's once
I still see his face

I said whoa, oh, oh, they carted me off
I said whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh, they carted me—

But I managed to escape the good Gendarme
I fled through field and farm, stripped of natural charm
Naked but that belt I wear so well
P-p-p-past the pyramids, and the liberty bell

I said whoa, oh, oh, they carted me off
I said whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh, they carted me—
Hey!
This is something I have to do for myself
Yeah, this is something I have to do for myself
I have to, for myself
I have to, for myself
Yeah, yeah!

I ignored the sheep and shepherds on my way
What can their small words say when they say them that way?
Bathed in sweat, feathered as a crow
I laid a beating of the sleet and snow with my frostbitten toes
I remain unrecognized in my hometown
Beneath my monstrous gown of feathery down
But I gathered up an army made of those
Who aimed to shake them from their repose

And we took up weapons, yeah!
And we took off our clothes
And we took up weapons, yeah
And we took off our—

Hey!
This is something I have to do for myself
Yeah, this is something I have to do for myself
I have to, for myself
I have to, for myself
Yeah, yeah!
So what say you and all your friends
Meet all of my friends in the alley tonight?
Yeah, what say you and all your friends
Step up to my friends in the alley tonight?
Yeah, what say you and all your friends
Meet all of my friends in the alley tonight?
Yeah, what say you and all your friends
Step up to my friends in the alley tonight?
Yeah!Embed
