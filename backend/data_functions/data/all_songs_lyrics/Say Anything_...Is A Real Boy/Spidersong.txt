Spidersong Lyrics
No more promises
I have made them before and broken them
Give me the go-ahead
And I'll undress myself for you
If you're at all interested

Now, I'm growing legs
I am the spider
I am the spider
I'm growing legs
I'm the spider
I am the spider
Crawl inside her
I'm the...
Hey

Oh, I know your pain
(Oh, I feel ya baby)
You, like I
Plagued by the flies inside your brain
Ohh, I'm creeping up your veins
Are you smart enough
And small enough to play this game?
I'm growing legs
I'm the spider
I am the spider
I'm growing legs
I'm the spider
I am the spider
Crawl inside her
I'm the...
Woah

I'd better watch my back around you
You've got the moves, the shoes, the 'do
You've got me
Oh, oh, no, no, no
And I want you to know I want to
You've got those tired eyes, all the time
You've got those tired eyes, all the time
You've got those tired eyes, all the time
Yeah, you need someone to bring you to bed

I'm growing legs
I'm the spider
I'm the spider
Now I'm growing legs
I'm the spider
I'm the spider
I am cold
Too cool to call you
Far too stoned to leave my bed
I'll write this song to win your kiss
But stay asleep instead
