Alive with the Glory of Love Lyrics
When I watch you, wanna do you
Right where you're standing (Yeah)
Right on the foyer, on this dark day
Right in plain view (Oh, yeah)
Of the whole ghetto
The boots stomp meadows
But we ignore that (Yeah)
You're lovely, baby
This war is crazy
I won't let you down
Oh, no, no

No
I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
Hell no, no, oh no
I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
Hell no, no

No
Oh, no no no!

And when our city, vast and shitty
Falls to the axis (Yeah)
They'll search the buildings, collect gold fillings
Wallets and rings (Oh, yeah)
But Ms. Black Eyeliner
You'd look finer with each day in hiding (Oh, yeah)
Beneath the wormwood
Oooh, love me so good
They won't hear us screw away the day
I'll make you say
No (Alive!)
I won't let them take you
Won't let them take you
(Alive! Alive with love, alive with love tonight)
Hell, no, oh no (Alive!)
I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
(Alive! Alive with love)
Hell no, no (Alive with love tonight)

Our Treblinka is alive with the glory of love!
Treblinka, alive, with the glory of love, yeah!

Okay, speed it up. Go!

Should they catch us
And dispatch us
To those separate work camps
I'll dream about you
I will not doubt you
With the passing of time (Oh, yeah)
Should they kill me
Your love will fill me
As warm as the bullets (Yeah)
I'll know my purpose
This war was worth this
I won't let you down
No, I won't
No, I won't
No, I won't
(Alive! Alive!
Alive with love tonight)
(Alive with love tonight)
Hell no no, oh no (Alive! Alive!)
I won't let them take you, won't let them take you
(Alive with love, alive with love tonight)
Hell no, no
No, no9Embed
