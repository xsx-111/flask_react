Every Man Has a Molly Lyrics
Here I am
Laid bare
At the end of my rope
I've lost all hope
So long
Molly Connolly just broke up with me
Over the revealing nature of the songs

You goddamn kids
Had best be gracious with
The merch money you spend
'Cause, for you
I won't ever have rough sex
With Molly Connolly again

Here I am
Laid down
At the end of my rope
Wishing I had not been born
Now I've spewed too much
I can never shut it up
I thought you should be warned
And I imply
Black sky
Took the needle to my eye
Sucked out all its glow
Woah
Molly Connolly ruined my life
I thought the world should know

I can't stop thinking 'bout
What she did wrong to me
Can't figure out
Just what I did wrong
Kill myself thinking 'bout
Things that you did to me
Molly Connolly
Can't stop thinking 'bout
What she did wrong to me
Just can't figure out
Just what I did wrong
Kill yourself thinking 'bout
Things that you did to me
Molly Connolly
Casey!
Can't stop thinking bout
Just can't figure her out
Kill myself thinking bout
My Molly Connolly
Can't stop thinking bout
(I can't stop thinking bout it)
Just can't figure out
(I won't stop thinking bout it)
Kill yourself thinking bout
I'll kill myself
I'll kill myself
(Molly Connolly)
I'll kill myself4Embed
