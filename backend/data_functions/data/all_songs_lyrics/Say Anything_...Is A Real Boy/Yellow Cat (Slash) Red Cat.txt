Yellow Cat (Slash) Red Cat Lyrics
I watch my yellow cat
Invade my red cat in the yard
The feline war has raged for years
So I assume it'd be too hard
For me to drive my foot between them
I would never risk the scratch
Just to prove to one or both of them
A cat is just a cat

Again I watch my cousin Greg
Watch MTV inside his home
He makes fun of the hip hop videos
From the couch he rides alone
Snug in the cushion of his cackling
He forgets his living doubt
He has relied on this for years
You will not yank the carpet out
No, no

These are my friends
This is who they have been
For always
These are my days
This is how they stay
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
(Okay check this out)
I watch this dude
Each night, same table
He creates and crumples up
His eyes are wide
From sipping endlessly
His endless coffee cup
He feeds me quotes
That lonely goat
I watch him grazing by himself
I will not stop him when he rambles
I'm becoming one myself

Lou is bugged
Shot up with drugs
Sweats this bird he hardly knows
All that he wants
Is to see someone he respects
Without their clothes
So like some hybrid mother/lover
She'd soothe and heal his wounds
And kiss them dying ears so softly
That the reaper stops to swoon
Oh, please
These are my friends
This is who they have been
For always
These are my days
This is how they stay
Hey, hey
These are my friends
This is who they remain forever
This is how we stay
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

(Ahhwwww shit!)
I watch my yellow cat, hey-hey
I watch my yellow cat
I watch my yellow cat, hey-hey
I watch my yellow cat

I watch my neighbor's son
Play with his shotgun in the street
I think I'll blaze all day
And marvel at the mass of food I eat
It's strange, I'm skinny when I'm standing
But I'm Buddha when I sit
And if I'm truly so enlightened
Why'd I waste your time on it
As I look back at countless crossroads
And the middle where I stay
Right up the beaten path to boredom
Where the fakest fucks get laid
By the faux-finest fines
It's been that way
God damn you, how you stay
With every scummy, crummy hour
Of the scummy, crummy day
Hey-hey!

These are my friends
This is who they have been
For always
These are my days
This is how they stay
Hey, hey
These are my friends
This is who they remain forever
This is how we stay
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey8Embed
