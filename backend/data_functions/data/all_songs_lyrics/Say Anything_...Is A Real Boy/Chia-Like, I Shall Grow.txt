Chia-Like, I Shall Grow Lyrics
I've watched you all succeed with the highest marks in greed
From my cave, where you're displayed like photographs that bleed
And my teeth grind names into their ivory membranes
I am hate everlasting with each sickly spell I'm casting

I discard all feelings
The stars scar my ceiling
Sun, I won't spare you. Moon, I won't spare you

And my pain is mine. It's become my friend with time
Chia-like, it grows. Watch it fester for my foes
One day, I'm gonna get up and get right back into the city
With my flamethrower mouth
You bet your life it won't be pretty

I discard all my feelings
As the stars still scar my ceiling (oh)
I won't spare you. (Whoa) I, I won't spare you

Photograph (bath), photograph (bath), photograph
Why'd you have to go and take a picture of a life like that?
You aren't new enough. I give up, I give up, I give up on you
Look at you (you), look at you (you), look at you (you)
Pretty boy floating face down in a pond of glue
You aren't new enough
We give up, we give up, we give up on all those like you
I discard all feelings
The stars scar my ceiling (whoa)
I won't spare you. (Whoa) I, I won't spare you

(Won't spare you, won't spare you
Won't spare you, I won't spare you)
I shall grow and grow
I shall grow and grow
I'll grow
I shall grow and grow
I shall grow and grow
I'll grow3Embed
