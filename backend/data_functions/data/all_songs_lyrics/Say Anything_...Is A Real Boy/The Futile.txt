The Futile Lyrics
Shit
Nothing makes sense
So I won't think about it
I'll go with the ignorance
Eat
Sleep, fuck, and flee
In four words, that's me
I am full of indifference

What do the old people teach us
But how to die (die), die (die)
What do those hissy fits teach you
Except how to cry, pussy, cry
Yeah, the futile, the futile
It outweighs the beautiful
Futile, the futile
It outweighs the beautiful
Futile, the futile, the futile, so
(Futile, the futile, the-)

Taste
I have no taste
I don't like these tiny portions
Or your artful abortions of sound
Sealed with a kiss
Slathered in the sauce, sarcastic
So go choke on your irony
What do the old people teach us
But how to die (die), die (die)
What do your hissy fits teach you
Except how to cry, pussy, cry
Yeah, the futile, the futile
It outweighs the beautiful
Futile, the futile
It outweighs the beautiful
Futile, the futile, the futile, so

I'm eating rat poison for dinner
Pull the cord from the phone
I am dining alone
Tonight
Rat poison for dinner
Pull the cord from the phone
I am dining alone
So goodnight

Love
I shall not love
Yet I'll still sing about it
Hope it covers the ocean in slime
The drama and drool
I'm leaking the blood of a fool
I'm full of it, I'm full of it, I'm full
Rat poison for dinner
Pull the cord from the phone
I am dining alone
Tonight
Rat poison for dinner
Pull the cord from the phone
I'm dining alone
Tonight
Oh, I am dining alone tonight
Tonight, tonight
Oh yeah5Embed
