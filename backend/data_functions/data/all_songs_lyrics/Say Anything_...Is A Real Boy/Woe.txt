Woe Lyrics
All the words in my mouth
That the scene deemed unworthy of letting out
Banded together to form a makeshift militia
And burrowed bloodily through my tongue and my teeth
And I stood proud in the gallery
With my open socket of a mouth for them to see
They all just laughed and said "That boy, he
That boy's got woe, whoa
He lives with woe, whoa"

And this girl who I met
Whose pride makes her hard to forget
She took pity on me horizontally
But most likely because of my band
And that's all I can get when I'm lonely
And these visions of death seem to own me
In the quiet of the classrooms
All across the stacked United States of Woe, whoa
We live with woe, oh, oh, oh, oh

She said
"I can't get laid in this town
Without these pointy fucking shoes
My feet are so black and blue
And so are you"
Please take me
Out of my body up through the palm trees
To smell California in sweet hypocrisy
Floating, my senses surround my body
I wake my nose to smell that ocean burn
Hah
Hah!

La da da, la da da, la da da, da da da
La da da, la da da, la da da, da da da
La da da, la da da, la da da, da da da
La da da, la da da, la da da...

So now I'm forging ahead
Passed all the plutocrats who sold me out
Go sob in your bed
If life is twice as pretty once you're dead
Then send me a card
I'm still the optimist
Though it is hard
When all you want to be is in a dream
A dream
La da da, la da da, la da da, da da da
La da da, la da da, la da da, da da8Embed
