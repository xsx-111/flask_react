Slowly, Through a Vector Lyrics
Passing slowly through a vector
Damp with fog
The bog that grows through former business sector
With my laugh, my lone companion
Only I can save the lives that blink within this canyon

(Whoa)
We're passing slow, we're passing slow
(Whoa)
Slow! Slow!

Drink the colors of the nighttime
If you were wrong, then I was right
And this will be the right time
(Oh!) I'll display my disaffection
(You grind me up, yeah, you spit me out!)
Out across the city
Loud and proud in your direction

(Whoa)
We're passing slow, we're passing slow
(Whoa)
Slow! Slow!
(Whoa)
We're passing slow, we're passing slow
(Whoa)
Slow! Slow!
When I get to your apartment
I climb the rail upside the building
A band of them were in your apartment
They tied you up, unwound, unwilling
I watch them cut, watch them touch
I watch them do what they came to do
And then in I come to lick it up
And clean up what is left of you

Ha, ha, ha
Show me what you've got2Embed
