Save the Last Dance for Me LyricsIf I dance every dance with the guy who gives me the eye, let him hold me tight
If I smile every smile for the man who holds my hand 'neath the pale moonlight
I won't forget who's takin' me home, and in whose arms I'm gonna be;
So, darlin', save the last dance for me...
Oh, I know that the music's fine, like sparklin' wine, and I'll have some fun;
I'll laugh and sing, but while we're apart, I won't give my heart to anyone;
And I won't forget who's takin' me home, and in whose arms I'm gonna be;
So, darlin', save the last dance for me...
Baby, don't you know I love you so; can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, ever let you go; I love you oh, so much
If I dance, and I carry on 'til the night is gone, and it's time to go
And if he asks if I'm all alone, can he take me home, I will tell him no;
'Cause I won't forget who's taking me home, and in whose arms I'm gonna be;
So, darlin', save the last dance for me...
And I won't forget who's takin' me home, and in whose arms I'm gonna be;
So, darlin', save the last dance for me...
Mmm, darlin', save the last dance for me...
And oh, no, no, no, darlin', save the last dance for me...Embed
