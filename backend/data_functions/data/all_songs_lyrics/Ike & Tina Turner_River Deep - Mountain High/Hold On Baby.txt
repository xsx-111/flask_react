Hold On Baby LyricsYou know they're...
Tryin' to tear us apart, you know they're tryin' to break our hearts;
Tryin' to tear us apart, you know they're tryin' to break our hearts...
You know they won't be leaving us alone until they ruin our happy home;
You know they're tryin' to tear us apart, you know they're tryin' to break our hearts...
Tryin' to break our hearts...
Tryin' to break our hearts...
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on! (Hold on!)
Hold on, baby! (Hold on, now!)
Hold on! (Hold on!)
Hold on, baby!
You know they're...
Going to tell us some lies, they gonna try to make us cry;
You know they going to tell us some lies, they gonna try to make us cry
And we will never get them to admit they really want to make us split;
You know they're tryin' to tear us apart, you know they're tryin' to break our hearts...
Tryin' to break our hearts...
Tryin' to break our hearts...
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on, baby!
Hold on!
Hold on, baby!
You know they're...
Tryin' to tear us apart, you know they're tryin' to break our hearts;
Tryin' to tear us apart, you know they're tryin' to break our hearts...
You know they won't be leaving us alone until they ruin our happy home;
You know they're tryin' to tear us apart, you know they're tryin' to break our hearts...
Tryin' to break our hearts...
Tryin' to break our hearts...
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on!
Hold on, baby!
Hold on!
Hold on, baby!Embed
