The Silent Man Lyrics
A question well served:
Is silence like a fever?
A voice never heard
Or a message with no receiver?

Pray they won't ask
Behind the stained glass
There's always one more mask

Has man been a victim
Of his woman, of his father?
If he elects not to bother
Will he suffocate their faith?

Desperate to fall
Behind the great wall
That separates us all
When there is reason (Tonight I'm awake)
Tonight I'm awake (The silent man)
When there's no answer
Arrive the silent man
If there is balance (Tonight he's awake)
Tonight he's awake (The silent man)
If they have to suffer
There lies the silent man


Sin without deceivers
A God with no believers
I could sail by on the winds of silence
And maybe they won't notice
But this time I think it'd be better if I swim
When there is reason (Tonight I'm awake)
Tonight I'm awake (The silent man)
When there's no answer
Arrive the silent man
If there is balance (Tonight he's awake)
Tonight he's awake (The silent man)
If they have to suffer
There lies the silent man2Embed
