Further Away Lyrics
The further away I get from you
The harder it gets for everyone else, for everyone else
The happier I am when I'm with you
The harder it gets when I am alone, when I am alone
The harder I try to learn something from you
Further away

Further away feel it fade into your childhood further away
Further away feel dazed and misunderstood
Further away

The stiller the oxygen the harder you breathe
The draining away just like an old man's dream
Just like an old man's dream
The simpler the answer the harder it can get
The circular landscape comes back only with regret
Only with regret
The more estranged I feel from my youth further away

Further away feel it fade into your childhood further away
Further away feel dazed and misunderstood
Further away
Further away feel it fade into your childhood further away
Further away feel dazed and misunderstood
Further away
Further away
Further away
Further awayEmbed
