Elvis Impersonator: Blackpool Pier Lyrics
20 foot high on Blackpool promenade
Fake royalty second hand sequin façade
Limited face paint and dyed black quiff
Overweight and out of date
20 foot high on Blackpool promenade
Fake royalty second hand sequin façade
Limited face paint and dyed black quiff
Overweight and out of date
Oh well

American trilogy in Lancashire pottery
American trilogy in Lancashire pottery

Is so fucking funny, don't you know
Is so fucking funny, don't you know

All American trilogy in used up cars and bottled beer
All American trilogy the futures dead, fundamentally

It's so fucking funny, it's absurd
It's so fucking funny, it's absurd
20 foot high on Blackpool promenade

I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray! Hooray!
In Dixie land, I'll take my stand
To live and die in DixieEmbed
