A Design for Life Lyrics
Libraries gave us power
Then work came and made us free
What price now
For a shallow piece of dignity

Right here in my dirty face
To wear the scars
To show from where I came

We don't talk about love
We only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end
A design for life
A design for life
A design for life

Right here in my pretty face
To wear the scars
To show from where I came
We don't talk about love
We only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end
A design for life
A design for life
A design for life
A design for life
We don't talk about love
We only want to get drunk
And we are not allowed to spend
As we are told that this is the end
A design for life
A design for life
A design for life
