Everything Must Go Lyrics
Shed some skin for the fear within
Is starting to hurt me with everything
Freed from the memory
Escape from our history, history

And I just hope that you can forgive us
But everything must go
And if you need an explanation
Then everything must go

I look to the future it makes me cry
But it seems too real to tell you why
Freed from the century
With nothing but memory, memory

And I just hope that you can forgive us
But everything must go
And if you need an explanation
Then everything must go

Freed us eventually
Just need to be happy, happy
And I just hope that you can forgive us
But everything must go
And if you need an explanation
Then everything must go
And I just hope that you can forgive us
But everything must go
And if you need an explanation
Then everything must goEmbed
