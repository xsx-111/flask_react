The Girl Who  Wanted to Be God Lyrics
There are no sunsets just silence
You could see that she was true and faithless
But see through the future and forget all the lies
Black out the words for the blind have eyes

I am the girl who wanted to be god
I am the girl who wanted to be god

There are times when you feel hopeless
Just for once for no-one else we are blameless
The dawn is still breaking its heaven is so high
She told the truth, told the truth and then she lied

I am the girl who wanted to be god
I am the girl who wanted to be god

Hold me she said love me to death

I am the girl who wanted to be god
I am the girl who wanted to be god
I am the girl who wanted to be god
I am the girl who wanted to be godEmbed
