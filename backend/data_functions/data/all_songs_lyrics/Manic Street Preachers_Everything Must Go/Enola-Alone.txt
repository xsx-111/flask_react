Enola/Alone Lyrics
The Statue of Liberty looks so solemn on the TV
100% risk of stepping outside
Every second too precious to try
My heart aches for Enola
From my birth a rellik, a killer
But all I want to do is live
No matter how miserable it is

Please sing to me a song
Enola, alone
Please take me on home
Enola, alone

I walk in the grass and I feel some peace at last
I walk on the beach and for once I feel some ease
I'll take a picture of you
To remember how good you looked
Like memory it has disappeared
Naked and lonely within my fears

Please sing to me a song
Enola, alone
Please take me on home
Enola, aloneEmbed
