Australia Lyrics
I don't know if I'm tired and I don't know if I'm ill
My cheeks are turning yellow
I think I'll take another pill
Praying for the wave to come now
It must be for the fifteenth time
I've been here for much too long
This is the past that's mine

I want to fly and run 'til it hurts
Sleep for a while and speak no words in Australia
I want to fly and run 'til it hurts
Sleep for a while and speak no words in Australia
In Australia

Praying for the wave to come now
It must be for the very last time
It's twelve o'clock till midnight
There must be someone to blame

I want to fly and run 'til it hurts
Sleep for a while and speak no words in Australia
I want to fly and run 'til it hurts
Sleep for a while and speak no words in Australia
In Australia
Australia, in Australia
I want to fly and run till it hurts
Sleep for a while and speak no words in Australia
In Australia
In Australia
In Australia2Embed
