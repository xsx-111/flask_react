Faded LyricsYou can believe in me, baby
Can I believe in you?
What you don't know
Can hurt you, child
All the things a mind can
Do to you
If I go bad
From time to time
Love to love but love is not
My only crime
Bathe the path, shine the light
Better get your ass up on
The mountain, baby
I'll take you up tonight

Faded
This I feel
Behind the blue clouds
I remain concealed
Lord, lift me out of the night
Come on, look down
And see the mess I'm in tonight
You can believe in me, baby
Can I believe in you?
I wish I could remember what
You said, when I said
Enough
You said
Good boy... bad boy... killjoy...
Get your ass over here, boy
And since I know
Myself so well
Don't breathe a word
Don't you ever tell
You can believe in me, baby
Can I believe in you?
That secret's gonna kill you
In the end
It's gonna kill
