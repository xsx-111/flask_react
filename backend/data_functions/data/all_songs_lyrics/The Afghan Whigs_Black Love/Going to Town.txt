Going to Town LyricsLover mine
Get your coat and come outside
I wanna take you for a ride
On into town
Lover fair
We'll be looking sharp, I swear
I want them all to stop and stare
When we take 'em down
Go to town, burn it down, turn around
And get your stroll on, baby
I'll get the car
You get the match
And gasoline
And as we ride
Away into the countryside
I feel as though i must confide
There is a cost
When you say
Now we got hell to pay
Don't worry, baby, that's okay
I know the bossEmbed
