Night By Candlelight LyricsRepeat these words
After me
In all honesty
Repeat these words
After me
If you dare to believe this
Yourself
Am I vain? Have I shame?
Are my thoughts of a man
Who can call himself sane?
Do I blame, all my pain
On the wickedness
I have arranged?
If I do, bring it down
Repeat these words
After me
In all honesty
Repeat these words
After me
If you dare to believe this
Yourself
Am I vain? Have I shame?
Are my thoughts of a man
Who can call himself sane?
Is my fate, all the same
As the man who has
Walked the line straight
If it is, bring it down
And I, I must rely, my dear
And I, cannot deny, my dear
There will be a reckoning
Which was, is
And is to come
Repeat these words
After me
In all honesty
Repeat these words
After me
If you dare
To believeEmbed
