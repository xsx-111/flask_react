My Enemy LyricsI hear the whispers, baby
If what they say is true
They say I killed the brother
To fall in love with you
These words, I heard them once before
A conversation I believe
How does a man begin to fall
When he does practice to deceive?
There was a voice behind my back
His face, I could not see it clear
The voice was so familiar, though
I knew my enemy was near
I knew my enemy was near
The sun is gone
And the sky is black
So get your ass
Out from behind my back
I told you once
And I told you all
And I told it like it was (sic)
You can't
Have me
If you can't
Catch me
Out of your mind, bent on revenge
To think I once called you my friend
You want the dog? I'll let him out
Come and get some, baby
Come and get some, baby
The sun is gone
And the sky is black
So get your ass
Out from behind my back
I told you once
And I told you all
And I told it like it was
I told it like it was
I told it like it wasEmbed
