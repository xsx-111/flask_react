Crime Scene Part One LyricsTonight, tonight, I say goodbye
To everyone who loves me
Stick it to my enemies tonight
Then I disappear
Bathe my path in shining light
Set the dials to thrill me
Every secret has its price
This one's set to kill
Too loose, too tight
Too dark, too bright
A lie, the truth
Which one should I use?
If the lie succeeds
Then you'll know what I mean
When I tell you I have secrets to attend
Do you think I'm beautiful?
Or do you think I'm evil?
Will you take me for a ride?
The one that never ends?
Too loose, too tight
Too dark, too bright
A lie, the truth
Which one shall I use?
If the lie succeeds
Then you'll know what I mean
When I tell you I have secrets to attend
Tonight, tonight, I say goodbye
To everything that thrills me
As I throw the chains
I forged in life
To shatter on the floor
As I dream, all the evidence
Is piling up against me
As I breathe all the essence rare
Is falling off the vine
And if you knew, just how smooth
I could stop it on the dime
You could meet me at the
