Double Day LyricsIt was a Saturday
I came home early drunk with love
And other things
I must confess I love it all
Pretend that I can hardly wait
To wipe that smile off of your face
It's only when
On that you can depend
Later that afternoon
My paranoia got the best of me
I knew it would, it always do
I made the call
Pretend that I can hardly wait
To put that smile back on my face
It's coming soon
I'm going to the moon
If you pretend, then I imitate
My friend, come crucify my heart
I wanna get it on
I wanna get it on
And in the evening when I sleep
My situation changes nightly
Sometimes it comes, sometimes it goes
Sometimes I feel I'll never know
Tonight's the night I take it home
White knuckle happy and alone
With no one in the room but me
I see I finally seeEmbed
