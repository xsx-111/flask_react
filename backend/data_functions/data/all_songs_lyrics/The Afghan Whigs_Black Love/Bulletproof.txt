Bulletproof LyricsLove
I can't hide
But it's been easier
Since I said it now
Love
It don't end
And I can't buy
A friend
I waited long
The waiting's over
So get on down
This time we go a little lower
The sun has broke
I stretch it out
And throw some gas into the fire
To tell the truth
To tell it well
It all depends upon the liar
And if I scream, overboard
I'm in this over my head
Or whisper sweet
Baby please, baby please
Am I ded?
Every time I dream about you, baby
With your hands all over me
I never forget anything
Don't forget that I'm asleep
Go to sleep
It's over now
A final prayer for my friend
You tell that fool, to make it good
You have to start at the end
And if I scream, overkill
I'm in this over my head
Or whisper sweet, baby please
I must have meant what I saidEmbed
