Blame, Etc. LyricsMy lust it ties me up
In chains
My skin catches fire at the
Mention of your name
No matter what I tried to do
I could not lose it
Now I know my heart
Is being used
But what I'm not allowed to have
I never could refuse
No matter what I tried to do
I stood accused
I reply, that I don't believe
I'm ever gonna die, I don't
Do you?
Blame, deny, betray, divide
A lie, the truth
Which one shall I use?
Whatcha gonna do?
I know
Whatcha gonna do?
I know, I know, I know
Your sanctimony
Is showing my dear
The acrimony
Hangs in the air
Beware of who you trust
In this world
Beware the lies about
To unfurl
I reply, that I don't believe
I'm ever gonna die, I don't
Do you?
You were blind
But you are not alone in this
As I, was once
Like you
Blame, etcEmbed
