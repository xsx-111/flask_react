What Up Dog? Lyrics
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
Monkey in the middle of a metal detector
Hat of the cousin of the tax collector, hmm
Automatic sensors in the President's skull
Do you have yesterday's time?

What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?
What up, dog?

You see, I just got this new pit bull terrier
Thing's better than a credit card
Went to the gas station the other day
Got a couple gallons of gas
Some oil, spark plugs, six-pack
Man says "That'll be $15.41"
I, I say "Well, god, goddamn, I forgot my wallet
But I did bring my credit card"
What up, dog?Embed
