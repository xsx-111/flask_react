Shadow & Jimmy Lyrics
Shadow and Jimmy were always yesterday’s news
Jimmy’s a bowler, Shadow rents out his green bowling shoes
Late Friday night when the bars are all shuttered and dark
He shadows back Jimmy to the lot in the lost trailer park

For Shadow and Jimmy every weekend end up the same
If it’s Saturday night, then it must be the hockey game
After cold beer and barbecued ribs the night is complete
With wrestling stories and elegant bones
That are tired of walking and on their way home

And they talk about the women
And they look at the girls
They’ll never know the ways of the world
They’ve got a mouthful of much obliged
And a handful of gimme
And the love for each other
Of Shadow and Jimmy

For Shadow and Jimmy now the story is told (The story is told)
There’s nothing to hold on to and no one to hold (No one to hold)
Men without women are like fish without water to swim in
(Water to swim in)
With their eyes bugging out they flop on the beach
And look up at the girls who are just out of reach
And they talk about the women
And they look at the girls
They’ll never know the ways of the world
They’ve got a mouthful of much obliged
And a handful of gimme
And the love for each other
Of Shadow and Jimmy
And they talk about the women
And they look at the girls
They’ll never know the ways of the world
They’ve got a mouthful of much obliged
And a handful of gimme
And the love for each other
Of Shadow and Jimmy
And the love for each other
Of Shadow and JimmyEmbed
