Anytime Lisa Lyrics
Anytime Lisa
Was what the guys named her
You could have her tonight
All you had to do was claim her
There was nothing to stop them
From taking her out
Night after night they kissed her
And tossed her about

You could prove you're a man (Prove you're a man)
They said that anyone can, whoa (Anyone can)
So everybody took a piece of
Anytime Lisa
Of Anytime Lisa

Anytime Lisa
Just couldn't refuse them
A girl wants love
But guys just abuse them
To be in their arms
Beats being alone
Still it wasn't like having
Someone of her own
You could prove you're a man (Prove you're a man)
They said that anyone can (Anyone can)
So everybody took a piece of
Anytime Lisa
Of Anytime Lisa

Oh, phone rings, it's another voice ('Nother voice)
Brief flings, but what's her choice?
She's by herself and there's no one else (No one else)

Oh, Anytime Lisa
I'm not like the others
Please understand me
I don't wanna be a one-night lover
There's something inside you
That I want to touch
Girl you just gotta trust me
I want you so much

No need to prove I'm a man (Prove I'm a man)
I'm just your number one fan (Number one fan)
I want more than just a piece of
Anytime Lisa
Of Anytime Lisa
Oh, Anytime Lisa
Anytime
Anytime Lisa
Was what the guys named her
You could have her tonight
All you had to do was claim herEmbed
