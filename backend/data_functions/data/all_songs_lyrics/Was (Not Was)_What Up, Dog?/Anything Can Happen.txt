Anything Can Happen Lyrics
She took me in the bedroom
To show me her computer
She asked me if I liked it
I told her she was cuter
She wasn't that great
But it was getting kind of late (Getting kind of late)

She talked about her father
Said he never really liked her
She said that she'd been married
To a schizophrenic biker
I thought I'd say goodbye
But then I saw her start to cry (Saw her start to cry)

We danced by the light
Of her video screen
She looked me in the eyes
And said "Why me?"

Oh, on any given night
Anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry
The favorite might fall (Favorite might fall)
With all of the people
Yelling and clapping
Anything can happen
Anything at all
She drove a baby blue Ferrari
She was all silk and diamonds
Living at the top
No need for social climbing
I asked her for a ride
She said "Right here by my side" (Here by my side)

We went to her place
Overlooking the bay
She said "There's just one bed
Would that be okay?"

Oh, on any given night
Anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry
The favorite might fall (Favorite might fall)
With all of the people
Yelling and clapping
Anything can happen
Anything at all

Oh yeah
Successful romance
Comes when you leave it up to chance
There's nothing you can do
When the fire burns low
And your heart turns cold
It comes to you
Out of the blue
On any given night
Anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry
The favorite might fall (Favorite might fall)
With all of the people
Yelling and clapping
Anything can happen
Anything at all
On any given night
Anything can happen (Anything can happen)
When the underdog is hungry
The favorite might fall (Favorite might fall)
With all of the people
Yelling and clapping
Anything can happen
Anything at all

Oh (Anything can happen)
Oh (Favorite might fall)
All of the people
Yelling and clapping
Anything can happen
Anything at all
Oh (Anything can happen)
Oh (Favorite might fall)
Oh yeah
Anything can happen
Anything at allEmbed
