11 MPH (Abe Zapp Ruder Version) Lyrics
Hey Kennedy, look out!
Oh no!

Lee Harvey O. didn't have no daddy
He never caught a break
He never drove a Caddy
Joined the Marines to learn a skill
And that he did
He learned how to kill

At eleven miles an hour
Such a deadly speed
Eleven miles an hour
At the time and place agreed
They pulled that limousine
Down Elm Street slow and clean
Lead fell like the shower
At eleven miles an hour

JFK went down to Dallas
To cool some heels in the oil palace
Unfriendly country
But he was not afraid
He would wave to the people
From a passing motorcade
At eleven miles an hour
Such a deadly speed
Eleven miles an hour
At the time and place agreed
They pulled that limousine
Down Elm Street slow and clean
Lead fell like the shower
At eleven miles an hour

JFK told Khrushchev I'll leave Castro alone
If you take away those missiles
They're too damn close to home
The CIA, the Cubans and the underworld bosses
Decided that was it
They had to cut their losses

At eleven miles an hour
Such a deadly speed
Eleven miles an hour
At the time and place agreed
They pulled that limousine
Down Elm Street slow and clean
Lead fell like the shower
At eleven miles an hour
Lee Harvey O. was made to order
A radical nut
A drifter and a boarder
Earl Warren got a version out fast
America was happy
The patsy had been cast

At eleven miles an hour
Such a deadly speed
Eleven miles an hour
At the time and place agreed
They pulled that limousine
Down Elm Street slow and clean
Lead fell like the shower
At eleven miles an hour

Eleven miles an hour
Eleven miles an hourEmbed
