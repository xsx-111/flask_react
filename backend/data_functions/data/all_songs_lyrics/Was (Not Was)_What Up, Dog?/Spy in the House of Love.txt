Spy in the House of Love Lyrics
Oh, oh yeah, spy in the house of love
Spy in the house of love
I don't know what I'm gonna do this evening
Spy in the house of love

The air was filled with suspicion
She poured us two martinis
And tried to guess my mission
I pretended to know nothing
It's best to use discretion
But she turned her floodlight eyes on me
And demanded a confession

I told her I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused, I'm waiting for your heart's defection
Spy (Oh yeah) in the house of love (Look it here)

I saw, yes I did, everything that pleased her
I recorded every movement
And plotted how to seize her
I used a tiny camera
I thought I'd Japanese her
I made a voodoo doll of her
And sat around and squeezed her
I told her I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused, I'm waiting for your heart's defection

I'll read your mail (I'll read your mail)
I'll tap your phone (I'll tap your phone)
I'm on your trail
You're never alone
One day you'll slip up
And leave a lip print on a coffee cup
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah oh yeah)
I'm a spy, yeah, but I just can't help myself
Spy in the house of love
Spy (Oh baby) in the house of love
Oh I can't go now

I used a tiny camera
I thought I'd Japanese her
I made a voodoo doll of her
And sat around and squeezed her

I told her I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused, I'm waiting for your heart's defection
I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
I won't be refused, I'm waiting for your heart's defection
I am a spy in the house of love
Gathering clues to be used in the war of the affections
I am a spy in the house of love
Used a little bitty camera
I thought I'd Japanese her
I'm gonna read your mail
I am a spy in the house of love
Gonna be on your trailEmbed
