Wedding Vows in Vegas Lyrics
One two three four

Plastic flowers in her hair
Don't they make a lovely pair?
Met last night at the slot machines
Him in leather, her in jeans

All night preacher does the ceremony
His wife throws Minute Rice, her tears are phony

But wedding vows in Vegas
Aren't meant to last for ages
You've got to be courageous
To play the odds that love will win
Whatever city you're in

A Polaroid's an extra twenty
Shoot the works man, we've got plenty
Witness is another ten
Thanks a heap and come again
Buffet dinner, nothing but the best
And check into some strip love nest

But wedding vows in Vegas
Aren't meant to last for ages
You've got to be courageous
To play the odds that love will win
Whatever city you're in

How can this be?
Ice cold Chablis
Cable TV
Continental breakfast free
Baby, then it's you and me
It's you

Buffet dinner, nothing but the best
And check into some strip love nest

But wedding vows in Vegas
Aren't meant to last for ages
You've got to be courageous
To play the odds that love will win
Whatever city you're in
Whatever city you're inEmbed
