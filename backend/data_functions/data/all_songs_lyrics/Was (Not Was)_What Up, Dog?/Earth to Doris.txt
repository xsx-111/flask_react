Earth to Doris Lyrics
At the loveless motel and restaurant out on Highway 33
The matchbook says call for reservations
Country ham and biscuits
Delicious steaks
I met a woman there one night
No moon just, just diesel trucks
She kissed me like she was hungry
So we got a room

In the morning she looked like a horse
Smoking little cigars
Playing these tapes of her husband
She says "Doesn't he sound like Elvis?"
She makes champagne out of 7 Up and cheap wine
A chemist!

Next to one of those insect electric chairs
Her skin gleaming blue every time a fly died
I read her the funnies
I laughed anyway
"Something's burning somewhere" I said
"Yeah, it's us" she says
"You both want coffee?" the waitress asks
Yeah, two, two coffees
That's perfect on this cold, dim, fluorescent morning
And, and a couple of those donuts over there, right Doris?
Right, Doris?
Earth to Doris
Earth to Doris
Come in Doris
