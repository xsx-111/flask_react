Love Can Be Bad Luck Lyrics
(Oh love)
(Oh love, yeah)

When two cars crash
You just pull them apart
But when lovers come together
They get tangled heart to heart

And nothing (Nothing)
And no one (And no one)
Can make them come unstuck

Oh, love can be bad luck
(Love can be bad luck)
Love can be bad luck
(Love can be)

When glass breaks
You just sweep it away
But when lovers start to shatter
They keep breaking day by day
They pick up (Pick up)
The pieces (The pieces)
And try not to get cut
(Try not to get cut)

Oh, love can be bad luck
(Love can be bad luck)
Love can be bad luck
(Love can be bad luck)
Love can be bad luck
(Love can be bad)

Medicine won't cure the pain
It doesn't pay to pin the blame
It still will feel the same
(Still will feel the same)
Oh, passion burns like any flame
Disillusion stakes its claim
Those are the rules of the game
(Rules of the game)

Oh love, oh love
Oh love, oh love
Oh love, oh love, yeah
Love, oh love, ooh
And nothing (Nothing)
And no one (And no one)
Can make them come unstuck

Oh, love can be bad luck
Love can be bad luck

When a storm hits
Crowds get washed away by the rain
Stay with me baby
Don't let me drown in my own pain

Oh, love can be bad luck
(Love can be bad luck)
Love can be bad luck
(Love can be bad luck)

So much pain in my heart, yeah
(Love can be bad luck)
I can't stand this pain no more
(Love can be bad luck)
I've been feeling this way a long time, girl
(Love can be bad luck)...Embed
