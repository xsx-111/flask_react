Silent In The Morning Lyrics
My glance is always darting when I stroll the avenue
Avoiding all the obstacles that terrorize my view
If you are here with me, I trust you to lead the way
When you’re not I follow you, and always go astray

You're silent in the morning, suspended in the trees
Lunch time comes, you’ve found your voice, it brings me to my knees
The volume just increases, the resounding echoes grow
Till once again I bask in morning stillness I love so

The target that I shoot for seems to move with every breath
I tighten all my arteries and make one last request
Divine creation hears me, and he squashes me with fear
I think that this exact thing happened to me, just last year

Silent in the morning
You found your voice that brings me to
Silent in the morning
You found your voice that brings me to
Silent in the morning
You found your voice that brings me to my knees
Silent in the morning
You found your voice that brings me to my knees
I will not dismiss you, shelter you, speak with you
Smile at you, trust in me, he’d like to brush you off, and I’d agreeEmbed
