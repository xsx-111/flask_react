Fluffy Lyrics
You look smart, but I don't care
I'm not looking for no love affair
I'd sell you my soul just to get me somewhere
What's there to do in this dead-out town?
Oh, I can't believe I live here now
So I'm searching for cheap thrills some way and somehow

Sixteen, so sweet!
Sixteen, so sweet!

Wait, waiting, I give in

Send me a ride and make it bright and early
What makes you smile just makes me feel funny
So who's gonna love me here and where's all the money?
What's there to do? I've got nothing in this dead-out town
Oh, I can't believe I live here now
So I'm searching for cheap thrills the way I know how

Sixteen, so sweet!
Sixteen, so sweet!
As I sit here waiting, palms itching
I hear the wheels breaking, train coming5Embed
