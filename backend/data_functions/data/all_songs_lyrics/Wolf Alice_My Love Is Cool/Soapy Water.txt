Soapy Water Lyrics
I wash my face with soapy water
Disguise the tears 'cause you're somebody's daughter
And they don't ever wanna see you cry
Anxiety's grip is always waiting to take me
It sits in my stomach, I fear it's starting to shape me
It's hard to live when you're scared to die

If I'm gonna sit and wait then I might as well
Ask for the hand of the Devil himself
I thought I heard her laugh but it was hard to tell
So look into my eyes and see how close I am to crack
But they just say hello and never look back
I thought I heard them talk but it was hard to catch

Superstition has me out of control
Touch my head and bless my soul
I pray it ain't a feeling, but my soul is just old
Cause nothing heals misery's fist
No witch's pill, no lover's kiss
If life is easy then what is this?

If I'm gonna sit and wait then I might as well
Ask for the hand of the Devil himself
I thought I heard her laugh but it was hard to tell
So look into my eyes and see how close I am to crack
But they just say hello and never look back
I thought I heard them talk but it was hard to catch
Light a smoke, put it out
Search for rooms, out of town
Start again, cut your hair
You've wondered love, but it's hard to care
(I'll care, I'll try to care)
Choose a religion, choose a goddamn sport
Go find something to eradicate these thoughts
You might not waste time, and keep good health
But that's not it, there's something else

If I'm gonna sit and wait then I might as well
Ask for the hand of the Devil himself
I thought I heard her laugh but it was hard to tell
So look into my eyes and see how close I am to crack
But they just say hello and never look back
I thought I heard them talk but it was hard to catch2Embed
