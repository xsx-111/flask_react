Giant Peach Lyrics

I got change in a pocket somewhere
Got my letter in the box
Tired of waiting for the bus to nowhere
And tired of chasing the stone fox
I don't tell lies no more, ya know
I just don't tell the truth
I don't know what I'm looking for, ya know
But I'm not looking for proof

I have a tricky love affair, ya know
With the place where I grew up
But it knows I'll never leave, ya know
I never left it much
I hate to see it despair, oh, don't you do it
I hate to see it screw up
But it knows I can hardly grieve
When it's hard to give a, hard to give a... (*scream*)

Don't know what keeps me here
It's not the boy giving the funny feels
Don't know what keeps me here
It's not the P to pay for the wheel
What the hell keeps me here?
In this dark old town that I've adored
The rules don't seem so clear
And change, it feels like fear, it's all you know
Our dark and pretty town
Our dark and pretty town
Our dark and handsome town
Our dark and pretty town
My dark and pretty town5Embed
