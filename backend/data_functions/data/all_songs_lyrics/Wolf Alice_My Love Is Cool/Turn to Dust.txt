Turn to Dust LyricsKeep your beady eyes on me
To make sure I don't turn to dust
If fear is in the mind then my mind lives in fear
As deep and as vast as the dirty British sea
Keep your beady eyes on me
To make sure I don't turn to dust
There's paths to make the heart beat and paths where I can skip
And a path to tread lightly with the clouds beneath my feet
When the light creeps from the blinds I dance in Heaven
It's just old passing time, it rains dead weather
Keep your beady eyes on me
To make sure I don't turn to dust1Embed
