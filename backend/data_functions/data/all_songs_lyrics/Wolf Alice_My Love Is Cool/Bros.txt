Bros Lyrics
Shake your hair, have some fun
Forget our mothers and past lovers, forget everyone
Oh, I'm so lucky, you are my best friend
Oh, there's no one, there's no one who knows me like you do

Are your lights on?
Are your lights still on?
I'll keep you safe
You keep me strong

Remember when we cut our hair?
We both looked like boys, but we didn't care
Stick it out together, like we always do
Oh, there's no one, there's no one quite like you

Are your lights on?
Are your lights still on?
I'll keep you safe
You keep me strong

Ohhh, jump that 43
Are you wild like me?
Raised by wolves and other beasts
I tell you all the time
I'm not mad
You tell me all the time
I got plans
Ohhh, jump that 43
Are you wild like me?
Raised by wolves and other beasts
I tell you all the time
I'm not mad
You tell me all the time
I got plans
Me and you, me and you, me and you
We could do better, I'm quite sure
Me and you, me and you, me and you
We could do better, I'm quite sure
Me, me, me, me, me and you
Me, me, me, me, me and you14Embed
