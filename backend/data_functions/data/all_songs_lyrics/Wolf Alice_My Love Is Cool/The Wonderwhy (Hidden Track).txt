The Wonderwhy (Hidden Track) Lyrics
What happens when we die?
"No, don't ask questions, just make sure you survive"
Lord give me faith so I have boxes to tick
And won't have to suffer the wonderwhy
Bring on the days when I don't give a...
And all I ever seek is pleasure
And I find thrill in sin and desire
And warm my toes on Hell's fire

Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold
Don't leave me here when I'm not sold

Don't leave me here
Leave me thinking for myself
When I can't remember the days of the week
The weeks of the month, and the months of the year
Where do we go? Go from here?
Sit writing lists and just wait for things to appear?
Don't leave me here at sixes and sevens
Shot to pieces begging the heavens
Begging hellfire and rattling the gate
Starting a riot and planning escape
Baby's growing up and asking questions
Looking for help for life in lessons
Baby's growing up, a life explosion
Drinking the milk, but locking the bedroom
Don't leave me here, I'm not sold
Don't leave me here, I'm not sold

I spied you on the tall brick wall
You sat smoking cigarettes
Teach me, teach me, teach me rock 'n' roll
No, I'm not a fighter
I'm just angry all the time
So teach me, teach me, teach me rock 'n' roll
My love bends rules
My love is cool
My love bends rules
My love is cool
