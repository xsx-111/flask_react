Moaning Lisa Smile Lyrics

She needs a lover to escape her father and mother
She hopes for some other way out of the hole
She's over achieving, chasing her dreams
And coming down slowly, yeah, it's out of control

A-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
Scrap the blues if the blues don't work
Flash your teeth though the inside hurts
A-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
Scrap the blues if the blues don't work
Doesn't make you feel better, just makes others feel worse

All in the books and all in her blood
And nowhere to run â€˜cos it's out of control
You wait for something to undo these feelings
Waiting and waiting but it's out of control

A-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
Scrap the blues if the blues don't work
Flash your teeth though the inside hurts
A-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
Scrap the blues if the blues don't work
Doesn't make you feel better, just makes others feel worse

A-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
A-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
It never is enough
No, it never is enough
It never is enough
No, it never is enough15Embed
