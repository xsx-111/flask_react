Swallowtail Lyrics
Swallowtail, I met you up atop The Shard
As we fell, I never thought we'd hit this hard
It's not right, but it's too late for that now
Swallow fear, and head straight down into the ground

And head straight down into the crowd
The crowd that you've been leaning on
To the crowd
The crowd that you believed were gone

Swallowtail, I met you up atop The Shard
As we fell, I never thought we'd hit this hard
It's not right, but it's too late for that now
Swallow fear, and head straight down into the ground

And head straight down into the crowd
The crowd that you've been leaning on
To the crowd
The crowd that you believed were gone

Swallowtail, I met you up atop The Shard
As we fell, I never thought we'd hit this hard
It's not right, but it's too late for that now
Swallow fear, and head straight down into the ground
And head straight down into the crowd
The crowd that you've been leaning on
To the crowd
The crowd that you believed were gone
