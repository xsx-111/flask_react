Silk Lyrics
Your broad shoulders, my wet tears
You're alive and I'm still here
As some half-human creature thing
Can you bring life to anything? Ooh
("Take this to make you better"
Though eventually you'll die)
If you don't love me, don't tell me
I've never asked who and I'll never ask why
("It's such a shame, she used to be so delightful")
Well, whose fault is that, if it wasn't Mum and Dad's?
"Well it must be yours"
We'll have none of that, no

Just looking for a protector
God never reached out in time
There's love that is a saviour
But that ain't no love of mine
My love it kills me slowly
Slowly I could die
And when she sleeps she hears the blues
And sees shades of black and white
(Run, run, run away)
(Run, run, run away)
Got to stay cool, you hot, hot head
Count to a thousand before you sleep in bed
Read the news, pass the time
Drink the juice, feeling fine
Got to stay cool, you hot, hot head
Count to a thousand before you sleep in bed
Read the news, pass the time
Drink the juice, feeling fine
"At least you're not boring"
No one ever wants to feel you're this sad, ohh

Just looking for a protector
God never reached out in time
There's love that is a saviour
But that ain't no love of mine
My love it kills me slowly
Slowly I could die
And when she sleeps she hears the blues
And sees shades of black and white
Just looking for a protector
God never reached out in time
There's love that is a saviour
But that ain't no love of mine
My love it kills me slowly
Slowly I could die
And when she sleeps she hears the blues
And sees shades of black and white26Embed
