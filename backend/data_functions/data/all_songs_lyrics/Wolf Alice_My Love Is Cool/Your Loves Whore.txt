Your Loves Whore Lyrics

Don't you want take time and get to know me?
We could build a perfect world
I got tricks I really want to show you
I could be your perfect girl

And when we grow older
We'll still be friends
We'll still be lovers
And won't fear the end

The light won't flicker and the light won't fade, believe me
And the world looks better in the place we made believe
Hearts keep pumping and there's one thing that keeps me breathing
It's the mantra I sing and the face I always see

And when we grow older
We'll still be friends
We'll still be lovers
And won't fear the end
And when we grow older (Oooh)
We'll still be friends (Oooh)
We'll still be lovers (Oooh)
And won't fear the end (Oooh)
I let your love tease me
Now I am your love's whore
Keeps me hardly breathing
But I could only love you more
I could only love you more
I could only love you more
I could only love you more
I could only love you more
