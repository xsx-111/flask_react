Lisbon Lyrics
You're gonna look at me twice, it's eventual
You're there when you're not cause I'm smoking your menthols
Smoking your menthols
Wearing all your clothes again
They're wearing thin but it's one way to be together
Be together

Swallow the fear
My stone cold fox
My arms are here
I've been ready for so long
And I would lick your wounds and care

Feel like running, feel like crack
Feel like going out and smashing windows
I'm smashing windows
And in a black, black hole, deeper than death
I would wait for you there, just give me the breath, to say it
Back together

Swallow the fear
My stone cold fox
My arms are here
I've been ready for so long
And I would lick your wounds and care
Feel like running, feel like crack
Feel like going out and smashing windows
I'm smashing windows
And in a black, black hole, deeper than death
I would wait for you there, just give me the breath, to say it
Back together6Embed
