Freazy Lyrics
Long were the days
Where the window held the deepest of my thoughts
It's okay, I found my place
Found on the way
To the place I never really thought I'd go
It's okay, you were there in the back of my brain

Did you really wanna...with Alice?
Did you really wanna...with the wolf?
You can hate us all you want but
It don't mean nothing at all
You can join us if you think you're wild
You can join us if you're a feral child
Our love is cool

I built the paths
That I took in my head over and over again
Step to step, to the light at the end
Oh, make believe
I was a prisoner to my thoughts throughout my teens
Look at me, I don't read in between

Did you really wanna…with Alice?
Did you really wanna…with the wolf?
You can hate us all you want but
It don't mean nothing at all
You can join us if you think you're wild
You can join us if you're a feral child
Our love is cool
I will meet you where the grass is greener
Hands on the clock, no, I ain't watchin' them either
I will meet you where the grass is greener
Hands on the clock, no, I ain't watchin' them either

(I will meet you where the grass is greener)
Did you really wanna...with Alice?
Did you really wanna...with the wolf?
You can hate us all you want but
It don't mean nothing at all
(Hands on the clock, no, I ain't watchin' them either)
You can join us if you think you're wild
You can join us if you're a feral child
Our love is cool

(I will meet you where the grass is greener)
Did you really wanna...with Alice?
Did you really wanna...with the wolf?
You can hate us all you want but
It don't mean nothing at all
(Hands on the clock, no, I ain't watchin' them either)
You can join us if you think you're wild
You can join us if you're a feral child
Our love is cool8Embed
