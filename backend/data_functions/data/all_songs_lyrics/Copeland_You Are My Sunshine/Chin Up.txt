Chin Up LyricsWith your eyes closed
Watching a strange show
Play out in your head
But you were smiling somehow
And your day froze
And everyone in it
Sat still as a rose
But we were moving somehow
Back to where we started
Losing who we were
Maybe we should only
Tip a bottle back to keep us filled up
Back to where we started
Losing who we were
Everybody knows that
You’d break your neck to keep your chin up
Open your eyes
And the drops come
In a snail race down to your neck
You look up
But you were smiling somehow
Back to where we started
Losing who we were
Maybe we should only
Tip a bottle back to keep us filled up
Back to where we started
Losing who we were
Everybody knows that
You’d break your neck to keep your chin up
You'd break your neck to keep your chin up
You'd break your neck to keep your chin up
Back to when we started losing who we were
(You'd break your neck to keep your chin up)
Everybody knows that you'd break your neck to keep your chin up
You'd break your neck to keep your chin up
You'd break your neck to keep your chin up
You'd break your neck to keep your chin up
Back to when we started
Losing who we were
Maybe we should only
Tip a bottle back to keep us filled up
Back to when we started
Losing who we were
(You'd break your neck to keep your chin up)
Everybody knows that you'd break your neck to keep your chin up2Embed
