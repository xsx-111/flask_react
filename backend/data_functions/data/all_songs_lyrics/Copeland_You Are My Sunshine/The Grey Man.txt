The Grey Man LyricsDon't worry now it's all erased, burned to grey and white. Your fireproof heart was never wasted, and steady all the while...So you say
Dont' worry now it's all come back. Colorless as night. You'll be there, you'll see her face. And hear her all the while
By the time you find your way, you're gonna run right back to the start. Don't think you're lost. You're gonna run right back to the start. And when you finally think it's gone, you're gonna run right back to her arms
Don't worry now it's all erased, burned to grey and white. Tell yourself you don't still taste her. Or hear her through the night
Run, run fast enough to lose yourself. Our legs were straight but only move in circles
By the time you find your way, you're gonna run right back to the start. Don't think you're lost. You're gonna run right back to the start. And when you finally think it's gone, you're gonna run right back to the start. You're gonna run right back to her armsEmbed
