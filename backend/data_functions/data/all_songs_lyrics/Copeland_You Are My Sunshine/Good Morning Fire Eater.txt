Good Morning Fire Eater LyricsWake up your eyes and darling, your smile
The day is done and everyone's gone now
You can taste every fire and hold every song
The world has moved, be quick enough to not miss it now
So wake up your eyes and darling, your smile
I'm afraid you've stopped to lick your wounds
Dear, do you know?
I'm afraid you've stopped to lick your wounds
Wake up your eyes
Darling, it's time to hope that forever they'll dry out
It never takes long and everything's gone
I only know her beauty won't fade out
Back on your side, darling, you lie
To yourself
I'm afraid you've stopped to lick your wounds
Dear, do you know?
I'm afraid you've stopped to lick your wounds
'Cause it's no good if you can have it all
I'd give it back, but I never stole the first part
And it always goes when you need it most
The kindest love is still bleeding from the last shotEmbed
