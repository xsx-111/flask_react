On The Safest Ledge LyricsDon't look ahead. Just run to me. Each step will find the next one recklessly. We'll find ourselves on the safest ledge. Well pardon me, I couldn't help myself but fall in to your life here. If only for a while, I'm here
Could you be happy to fall like a stone, if you'd land right here safe in my arms? It's fine. Lock all your doors through the night. Keep it all right here safe in my arms. It's fine
You felt alone before you ever really knew how alone you were. An empty house a lonely room, the TV talks the fear right out of you. But you feel like someone's standing by, but you'll never know
Could you be happy to fall like a stone, if you'd land right here safe in my arms? It's fine. Lock all your doors through the night. Keep it all right here safe in my arms. It's fine
The sun burns a hole straight through your hopeful eyes if you look toward the sky, even on your grayest night. Could you be happy now with the wind in your hair, and your eyes open wide, and your feet going nowhere?Embed
