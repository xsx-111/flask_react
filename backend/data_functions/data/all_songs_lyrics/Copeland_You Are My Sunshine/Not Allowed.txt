Not Allowed LyricsHere we go I'll smile for you now cause you're sad, but I'm not allowed to be sad. And here we go I'll make a joke for you now, make you smile. But I'm not allowed to be sad
Turn away, you're falling on the inside from your sky, but felt no pain, and didn't ever want to wonder why
Here we go I'll burn for you now cause you're mine, and you're not allowed to feel nothing. Careful I may fall apart for you now, make you cry. But I'm not allowed to be sad
Turn away, you're falling on the inside from your sky, but felt no pain, and didn't ever want to wonder whyEmbed
