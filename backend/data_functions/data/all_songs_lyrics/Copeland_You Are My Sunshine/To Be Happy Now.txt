To Be Happy Now LyricsIn the moments before time starts moving backward, I will feel her hand in the palm of mine. And the cities will return to the field of flowers, and every step we took tracing back in line. And in disarray you just want to live one more day
'Cause you just want to be happy now
Longing and sorrow, well they won't find you where we are, smiling down the avenue. And the children getting younger as we pass, they couldn't make you turn back
'Cause you just want to be happy now
When every fire we sparked was just another blinking out, they're glowing like an ember in the dark
'Cause you just want to be happy nowEmbed
