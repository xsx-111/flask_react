Not So Tough Found Out LyricsNot so tough
Found out, found out
Feels so warm
Sun fire, sun fire
Not so strong
Lost out, lost out
Twice as sweet
Come ‘round, come ‘round
Not so fast
Come back, come back
Steal away a smile, a smile
Not right now
Lay down, lay down
Not so tough
Found out, found out
Not so tough
Found out, found out
Feels so warm
Sun fire, sun fire
Not so strong
Lost out, lost out
Twice as sweet
Come ‘round, come ‘round
Not so fast
Come back, come back
Steal away a smile, a smile
Not right now
Lay down, lay down
Not so tough
Found out, found out
Hold me, you're here and then you're gone, love
Like a dream, like a sigh
Tell me you're hearing every word now
Like a song, love, like a song
Ahh
Not so tough
Found out, found out
Feels so warm
Sun fire, sun fire
Not so strong
Lost out, lost out
Twice as sweet
Come ‘round, come ‘round
Not so fast
Come back, come back
Steal away a smile, a smile
Not right now
Lay down, lay down
Not so tough
Found out, found outEmbed
