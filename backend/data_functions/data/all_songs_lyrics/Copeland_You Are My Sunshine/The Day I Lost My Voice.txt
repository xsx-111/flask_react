The Day I Lost My Voice LyricsIt's sure as the floor 'neath my toes and somehow not surprised
That I was superimposed somehow in this life
And if my friends and my foes would just drop me a line, it'd be nice
You see love is a drink that goes straight to my head
And time is a lover and I'm caught in her stead
And the sentiment there follows me straight to my bed through the night
I've got my life in a suitcase and ready to run, run, run away
I got no time 'cause I'm always trying to run, run, run away
'Cause everyday when it feels like it's only a game
I've got my life in a suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcase
What could be an anchor here, with a storm on the rise
When you never meant to see so clear when smoke gets in your eyes
And the man in the moon never makes his replies understood
I've got my life in a suitcase and ready to run, run, run away
I got no time 'cause I'm always trying to run, run, run away
'Cause everyday when it feels like it's only a game
I've got my life in a suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcase
A suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcase
A suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcase
For a moment I was warm and the world made sense
And for a moment here this storm made no consequence
I've got my life in a suitcase and ready to run, run, run away
I got no time 'cause I'm always trying to run, run, run away
'Cause everyday when it feels like it's only a game
I've got my life in a suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcase, a suitcaseEmbed
