Should You Return LyricsSee the night is all I have to make me fear
And all I want is just a love to make it hurt
'Cause all I need is something fine to make me lose
Now it's a funny way I find myself with you
Because a song is all I have to make me feel
And all it takes is just a love to make it hurt
And every sound arranged in time could make me lose
Now it's a funny way I find myself with you
But now there's nothing left to do but waste my time
I never knew where to move on
I never knew what to rely upon
But now there's nothing left to say to change your mind
And if you're unhappy still
I will be hanging on your line
Should you return
Should you return
Should you return
Because the night is all I have to make me fear
And all I want is just a dream to make it worthwhile
'Cause all I need is someone close to make me lose
Now it's a funny way I find myself with you
But now there's nothing left to do but waste my time
I never knew where to move on
I never knew what to rely upon
But now there's nothing left to say to change your mind
And if you're unhappy still
I will be hanging on your line
But now there's nothing left to do to draw your eyes
I never knew where to move on
I never knew what to rely upon
But now there's nothing left to say to change your mind
And if you're just sinking down
I will be pulling on your line
But now there's nothing left to do but waste my time
I never knew where to move on
I never knew what to rely upon
But now there's nothing left to say to change your mind
And if you're unhappy still
I will be hanging on your line
Should you return
Should you return
Should you returnEmbed
