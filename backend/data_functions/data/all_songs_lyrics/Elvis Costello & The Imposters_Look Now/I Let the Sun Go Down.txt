I Let the Sun Go Down Lyrics
Whenever I'm in the tightest corner
Whenever I feel forlorn
I think of the isle where I was born
And the duty to which I've sworn
But I woke up in a nightmare
With a Union Jack and half a crown
John Bull got caught with his pants down, again

That's inviting sundown
It's time to do or die
It's time to say goodbye

'Cause I'm the man who lost the British Empire
Yes I'm the one, I let the sun go down

Don't let the shadows lengthen
And cover my good intentions
They say that darkness brings the right time
But it's also time for tears
I'm so sorry and sincere
Ahead of me a brilliant career
Now I'm going nowhere
It's time to do or die
It's time to say goodbye

'Cause I'm the man who lost the British Empire
Yes I'm the one, I let the sun go down

Stay awhile, delay the night
I'm too young for twilight
And tell the sun to hesitate
That's when Britain was great

Now that the lights are flickering
My pulse is quickening
All over the world the lamps will dim
And never be seen again
The balloon's gone up, the night descends
As they lower the flag on no-man's land
They'll take you down a peg or two
This is the bitter end
I walk into darkness
It's time to do or die
It's time to say goodbye

'Cause I'm the man who lost the British Empire
Yes I'm the one, I let the sun go down

I let the sun go down
Don't let the sun go down
I let the sun go down
Yes I'm the man who lost the British Empire
Yes I'm the one, I let the sun go downEmbed
