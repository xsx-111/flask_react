Photographs Can Lie Lyrics
He was wired, dynamite
And she was rare as treasure
That's not the kind of story you deny
In a frame under glass
They'll always be together and so in love
But photographs can lie

Now they say
That I have the gaze
That must recall my father
Sayin' he's my knight
My bright morning sun
Now I am mourning everyone

See him now, know he cheats
Why can't she see through him?
He used to be more valiant than vain
Put him on a pedestal
And it's a long way down there
I'll never be his little girl again

Now they say
That I have the gaze
That must recall my father
Sayin' he's my knight
My bright morning sun
Now I am mourning everyone
Someone else will look at me
And think he is my lover
Developing the image in his eye
In a frame under glass
We'll always be together and so in love
But photographs can lieEmbed
