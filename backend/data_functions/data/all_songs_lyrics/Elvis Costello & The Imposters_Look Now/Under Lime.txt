Under Lime Lyrics
It's a long way down from the high horse you're on
When you stumble and then you're thrown
And the last time we saw him he was out in the rain
Watching that train roll down the track
Now he's back in showbiz
Trying to make a comeback

We know that he's desperate and we know that he's broke
He's the mystery guest we'll puncture
They told a young girl with a clipboard "Just keep him amused"
Whatever you do, don't tell him your name
Whatever you think, don't let him drink
Under lime, under lime, under lime

He whistles out of tune, his words don't always rhyme
"But we will be right back, we're almost out of time"

Down a long corridor he's trying to impress
He was helpin' a showgirl fasten up her dress
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play
In the violent strip of an undressing room
She loosened his grip and started
Tell me your story, if you feel so inclined
He was a mess, almost resigned
Though she could guess, I think you will find
And she thought, "Oh you know, I wouldn't mind"

He asked her boyfriend's name then her whole family tree
She thought "I can't believe it's happening to me"

And upset, said "Hey pet, would you kindly pass that pill
And allow me to just dictate my dying will?"
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

Jimmy was dreamin' as she uncrossed her legs
He shuttered his eyes discreetly
And he thought of a drummer and considered a snare
But the beat of his heart said, "Don't even start"
His conscience was bare, said, "Hey, don't even dare"
She's completely unaware
She forced a laugh or a sigh at every alibi
Once every crime was confessed he buttoned up his vest

Said "Hey gal, you're a pal, you've really been a sport
And you don't get a record if you never get caught"
And the clock on the wall tick-tocked the time away
And the band starts to play

It's a long way down from the high horse you're on
It's a long way back as you cover your track
Or you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime, under lime
It's a long way down from the high horse you're on
It's a long way back as you cover your track
Or you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime, under lime
It's a long way down from the high horse you're on
It's a long way back as you cover your track
As you bury your crime
Under lime, under lime, under lime, under limeEmbed
