Mr. & Mrs. Hush Lyrics
I tripped through a house of mirrors
Distorted my suspicions and fears
(I heard a whisper)
There is a place where those secrets begin
(They had a list)
I gave my name and they invited me in
(But here's the twist)
A sign flickered and it started to flash
"Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Hush"

Haven't you tired of that darkness yet?
Didn't you cry your heart out?
It's only a dream
What is it about love you can't accept?
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready to be Mr. and Mrs. Hush?
Mr. and Mrs. Hush

But it was something I just couldn't understand
Till I slipped my finger into the band
Just think what those eyes might betray
Stare hard now, and don't look away
Haven't you tired of that darkness yet?
Didn't you cry your heart out?
It's only a dream
What is it about love you can't accept?
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready to be Mr. and Mrs. Hush?
Mr. and Mrs. Hush

I don't know if I'm deep down
Right inside her heart or outside her door
I don't know if I have the key to either
Uncertain if I should take her hand or leave her

(I thought I saw her)
It's a game of blindfold and bluff
(I thought I saw her)
You know I love you, is it ever enough?
(I thought I saw her)
Oh, what did I know
(I thought I saw her)
Heigh-ho and there you go
(I thought I saw her)
We know what has deep down kisses like hers
(I thought I saw her)
A voice that caresses and heels like spurs
(I thought I saw her)
What if you walked in with some other fellow
(I thought I saw her)
Heat is rising and red is the colour
(I thought I saw her)
Green is the colour of my true love's eyes
(I thought I saw her)
Green is the colour of those jealous disguises

Haven't you tired of that darkness yet?
Didn't you cry your heart out?
It's only a dream
What is it about my love you can't accept?
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready to be Mr. and Mrs. Hush?
Mr. and Mrs. Hush
Mr. and Mrs. Hush
Mr. and Mrs. HushEmbed
