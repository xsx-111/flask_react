Dishonor the Stars Lyrics
If you wake and chance to look above you
There's one I named to show how much I love you
Hanging up high

Poets long have written and have sung of
Moonlight and some distant satellite and
When we're young we wish upon them
Other men may only dream to kiss you
But it's not a thrill like this
Put your lips a little closer to my cheek
Then whisper, then speak
So tell me if you know
How deep can this thing go?

Honey will still desire the flowers
And there will be a love like ours
Until the sky dishonors the stars

What in the world would all this amount to?
If I can't tell you how much I want you
On such a night the sky might dishonor the stars
Disown and dishonor the stars
Poets long have written and have sung of
Moonlight and some distant satellite and
When we're young we wish upon them
Other men may only dream to kiss you
But it's not a thrill like this
Put your lips a little closer to my cheek
Then whisper, then speak
So tell me if you know
How deep can this thing go?

Honey will still desire the flowers
And there will be a love like ours
Until the sky dishonors the stars

What in the world would all this amount to?
If I can't tell you how much I want you
On such a night the sky might dishonor the stars
Disown and dishonor the starsEmbed
