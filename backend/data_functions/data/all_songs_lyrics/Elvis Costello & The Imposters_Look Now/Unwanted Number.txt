Unwanted Number Lyrics
You should hear the things that they say about me
They're saying "She's no better than she needed to be"
They don't know that he was kind and warm and tender
Soon it's gonna be another unwanted number
Unwanted number

How can I tell them?
How can I express?
How it felt to step out of this life and into his embrace
How can I tell them?
How can I explain?
All the love that I never had I found in him

There may be a stain on the family name
But if my father was here I think I know who he'd blame
Mother says that he just doesn't care to remember
And all he thinks of me is another Unwanted Number
Unwanted number

Why can't you tell me
Why can't I expect
Of all the painful lesson that you learned you never earned respect
Why can't you tell me
Why can't I believe
That you really really really cried, whenever he would leave
There's a local game where they whisper my shame
They say "He gave her his child
He wouldn't give her his name"
They will torture me from January to September
And I will give my love to another unwanted number
Unwanted number
Unwanted number

I will give my love to another unwanted number
Unwanted number
Unwanted number
And I will give my love
I will give my love
And I will give my love
I will give my love to another unwanted number
Unwanted number
Unwanted number
And I will give my love
I will give my love
And I will give my love
I will give my love to another unwanted number
Unwanted number
Unwanted number
