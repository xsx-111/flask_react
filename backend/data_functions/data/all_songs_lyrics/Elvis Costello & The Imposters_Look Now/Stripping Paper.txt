Stripping Paper Lyrics
I got time on my hands, I'm just stripping paper
It's amazing what you will find stripping paper
When you get down to the past

Back then we didn't have means for fine decorations
So we painted while mixing wine with flirtation
There in the mess of it all

He took me right there in the thrill
Not quite against my will
With my back to that rococo wall
We slipped right down to the floor

I can't close the door, he complimented my taste
I anointed his serious face with wallpaper paste
I wish we could laugh like that now
But what seemed to follow
That ended up hollow
Was I there?

Tear a strip or two
See what what came not much later
Here's a pony and a toy balloon
Behind the vine that withered all too soon
Here's the pencil of a measuring mark
And the monsters you spied in the dark
Now I got no place in her heart
Let me go back to the start
I got time on my hands, I'm just stripping paper
I got time on my hands, I'm just stripping paper
I got time on my hands, I'm just stripping paperEmbed
