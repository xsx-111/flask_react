Suspect My Tears Lyrics
Do you remember how to say please?
You've had your own way for such a long time
Your lash is sweet down, I dry your cheek
You think I'm powerless when you speak

You may have something, I don't deny
You look so beautiful when you cry
If I seem unconcerned
Perhaps it's time you learned

I'll cry until you suspect my tears
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
You're not the only one who can turn it on
When and where you need it

Do you remember how bad it felt?
Big eyes would fill up, your lip would tremble
You want to hurt me but then you melt
You always promise to lose control

I learned a trick that you used to play
I'm tired of you having it your own way
With the power to persuade
Beginning to cascade
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
You're not the only one who can turn it on
When and where you need it

If you be weeping, I may be cheating or just laughing inside
If you're suspicious that I'm sly and vicious, here's your chance to decide
Two hypocrites collide

I'll cry until you suspect my tears
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
You're not the only one who can turn it on
Where and when you need it
Oh-oh, when you need it
Oh, I'll cry until you suspect my tears
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
You're not the only one who can turn it on
When and where you need it
Oh, when you need it

I'll cry until you suspect my tears
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
I'll cry until you suspect my tears
I'll cry until you suspect my tearsEmbed
