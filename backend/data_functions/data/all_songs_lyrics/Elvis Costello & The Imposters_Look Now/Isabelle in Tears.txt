Isabelle in Tears Lyrics
Isabelle in tears, Isabelle is ringing
Saying "I need you near to me
But a telephone just isn't worth the flinging
Like a book or that ashtray that I aimed at your head
I'd rather see you dead"
But it's not as it appears
So I tripped up the stairs to find
Isabelle in tears

Isabelle remains the Isabelle in tethers
Wears a flimsy negligee of innocence and feathers
She says, "that's a good idea" as she pours herself a shot
But she can't get the genius back into the bottle
After you're kind you'll find that no one cares
So her lovers and her fears leave
Isabelle in tears

And I left her standing out there in the rain calling my name
As I pulled away pretending that I'd never met her

Oh, you'll never know the thrill of the Isabelle of memory
They say she was a bombshell who turned to an incendiary
Till the whole town burned down and returned into the earth
Can you admit your love? Can you confess her worth?
That slant of time obscures
But on certain nights appears
Like Isabelle in tears
That slant of time obscures
But on certain nights appears
Like Isabelle in tearsEmbed
