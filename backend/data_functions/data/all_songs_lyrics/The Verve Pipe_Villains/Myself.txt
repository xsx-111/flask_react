Myself LyricsYou never seen nobody as divine as
She can see reflections in her own eyes
An admission of desire
On a handsome afternoon
Is an ovation to her ego
In her everyone is everything and everything is mine
Ms. Marceau
You don't need another
You'll always be your own hero
Myself Ms. Marceau
You don't need another
You'll always be your own hero
As if we're speaking in another language
Every word means I, me, mine
Every hello every good
No escape to the life of the average
It's an ovation to my ego
In her everyone is everything and everything is mine
Myself Ms. Marceau
You don't need another
You'll always be your own hero
Hey
We're very fortunate to have her here
Accounts are empty and my friends deserted long ago, but
She says that I'm okay
So I'm okay
Ms. Marceau
You don't need another
You'll always be your own hero
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Myself Ms. Marceau
You don't need another
You'll always be your own hero
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, you
(Myself Marceau) In her everyone is everything
(Myself Marceau) In her everyone is everything
(Myself Marceau) In her everyone is everything
(Myself Marceau) In her everyone is everything
