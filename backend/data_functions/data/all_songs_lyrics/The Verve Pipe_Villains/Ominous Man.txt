Ominous Man LyricsI should be half a mile from here
I will go anywhere she goes
Shoulder the bags of a previous lover
I will go anywhere she goes
Sleep on the pillow that reeks of another
A will of mine to be impressive
I'm an amorous man
Now I will go anywhere she goes
Travel whenever, whatever the distance
The court deemed me to be offensive
I'm an ominous man
Once love is unanimous
No order demands
I should be half a mile from here
The court deemed me to be obsessive
I'm an ominous man
Jury rejects the alibi seeminly watertight
For the ominous man
I am the ominous man
(I am the ominous man)
I am the ominous man
(I am the ominous man)
I am the ominous man
(I am the ominous man)
I am the ominous man
(I am the ominous man)
(I am the ominous man)
(I am the ominous man)
(I am the ominous man)
(I am the ominous man)
(I am the ominous man)
(I am the ominous man)
(I am the ominous man)
(I am the ominous man)Embed
