Drive You Mild LyricsAnd if I ever drive you mild
And suffering this open kiss
And I'm barely juvenile
When everyone is outrageous
And I alone will be sleeping through the afternoon
And if I ever drive your style
And suffering your day predicted
With no ability to rile
And every yawn is contagious
And I alone will be sleeping through the afternoon
I should drive you wild
Yes, I should drive you wild
(Ever drive you mile) Ever drive you mild
(Ever drive you mile) Ever drive you mild
(Ever drive you mile) Ever drive you mildEmbed
