Villains LyricsI turned the volume up this morning
'Till there was ringing in my ears
I haven't felt this good in years
Another villain on the cover
Of every major magazine
The victim somewhere in between
See how they twist and shout
And as I'm searching for the story
Subscription card falls to the floor
I'm losing interest more and more
To pick it up I'm bending over
Out of the corner of my eye
I see a pair of blazing thighs
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
I straighten up to look her over
And up my back a shooting pain
It's bound to settle in my brain
Another villain on the cover
Of every major magazine
The victim somewhere in between
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shout
See how they twist and shoutEmbed
