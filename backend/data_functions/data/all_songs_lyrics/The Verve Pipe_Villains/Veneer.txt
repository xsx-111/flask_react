Veneer LyricsThirteen miles on 31 are drying
All along adopt-a-highway
Lay the empty cans of masquerade
Thirteen miles on 31 are drying
The sky is lavender with ivory clouds
That threaten drops of finger paints
And puddle jumping children clad
In yellow raincoats splash the deeper purple
Of veneer
Rows and rows of animals
Their shiver skin is painted different shades
And from grazing tainted grass
Their teeth are stained the incandescent green
Indifferent they watch the rainfall
Steady blend their spots and run their stripes
Of veneer
Lovely ladies
Strip themselves of furs the winds require
Lovely ladies
Bathe themselves in technicolor mire
Lovely gentlemen
At 85 on 31, I'm flying
Flying
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Indifferent they watch the rainfall)
(Steady blend their spots and run their stripes)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Indifferent they watch the rainfall)
(Steady blend their spots and run their stripes)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Indifferent they watch the rainfall)
(Steady blend their spots and run their stripes)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Indifferent they watch the rainfall)
(Steady blend their spots and run their stripes)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Indifferent they watch the rainfall)
(Steady blend their spots and run their stripes)Embed
