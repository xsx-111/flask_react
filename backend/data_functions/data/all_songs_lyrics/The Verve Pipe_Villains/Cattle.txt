Cattle LyricsBoy, there was a day, an assortment of rhymes
And waving, we rode that parade for awhile
And everybody knew everybody
Boy, there was a day being lonely was hard
And then your attention was never enough
I don't really know anybody in love
I don't want to know anybody in love
And when the mouth is open grows a cancer
Everybody wins
Round and round and round and settle down
Settle down
I don't really know anybody in love
I don't want to know anybody in love
Brand the herd of those who duplicate
And crush the wind of those who deviate
And ride the wave along the mitigated mile
Ride the wave along the mitigated mile
I don't really know anybody in love
I don't want to know anybody in loveEmbed
