Barely (if at all) LyricsWhen my love complained, every word
A breath on my last dandelion
And so lovers will leave and their tears
Souvenirs for the very first time
I searched the world reluctant
To find a lover enthusiastic
Speak to me barely, if at all
If at all
When I was a boy, funny things
Water wings kept you confident
A belly of wine, similar
To keep yourself indifferent
I scraped the bargain basement
Bought a lover less than fantastic
Spoke to me barely, if at all
Taste perfume that burns my throat
And I am free of envelope
Squeeze an instant out of me
And she placed a hand between our lips
How could anything be so precious?
She kissed me barely, if at all
And she, with her hand between our lips
Gave me what we now have in common
She left me barely, if at allEmbed
