Real LyricsMy sister had a nursery rhyme
Set of figurines
She'd often let me play with them
I'd set 'em up in different scenes
Fifty plastic army men
Led by Superman
Destroyed the ranks of Mother Goose
Mary and her little lamb
Slips away and catches
Sister getting real
And I can too
As long as I don't make a sound
When we were real, we were in love
With everyone and everything
I guess it was the beauty of bluebird
Clears his throat of phlegm and static singing operatic
Evening comes, and the butterflies are bats
Eat the spider that had saddled up beside her
And the dish, his lovin' spoon were never found
And I'm taking flight seeking relief
The lure of handkerchief so white
I chase it straight into the ground
Slips away and catches
Sister getting real
And I can too
As long as I don't make a sound
And I'm taking flight seeking relief
The lure of handkerchief so white
I chase it straight into the groundEmbed
