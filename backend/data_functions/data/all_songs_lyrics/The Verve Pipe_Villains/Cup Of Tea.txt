Cup Of Tea LyricsI'm visiting
The ground's a little weathered where I stood
Right field in my neighborhood
I was mostly last, always least, dig it
At graduation everyone
Will throw their hats into the sun
But they'll drop like flies to the sea
This is not my cup of tea
And Valerie
The winter won't be keeping her around
I'm nailing leaves to the ground
But it feels like sand underneath
She's never letting me forget
I've always been an idiot
But at times like this I agree
This is not my cup of tea
It's not, it's not, it's not
Of tea
It's not, it's not, it's not
My cup of tea
Crash
In a wrinkle of steel we are gone
Will my last breath be a yawn
Watching them sorting debris
This is not my cup of tea
It's not my cup of tea
It's not, it's not my cup of tea
My cup of tea
Tea
