Penny Is Poison LyricsBlushing a cue for her falsities
Advantage is my only masterpiece
Penny is poison but I don't mind
Penny is poison but I don't mind
Gardening malice for murderers
Flushes to me are the weeds to her
Penny is poison but I don't mind
Penny is poison but I don't mind
We know who we are
We know who we are
We know who we are
Starving the love of the marvelous
I was the penny to previous
Penny is poison but I don't mind
Penny is poison but I don't mind
Gardening malice for murderers
Flushes to me are the weeds to her
Penny is poison but I don't mind
Penny is poison but I don't mind
We know who we are
Penny is poison but I don't mind
We know who we are
Penny is poison but I don't mind
We know who we are
Penny is poison but I don't mind
We know who we are
Penny is poison but I don't mind
We know who we areEmbed
