Photograph (radio edit) LyricsIf you want beautiful, pitiful
Have me in a picture
And if you want make me dance, throw me 'round
Spin upon your finger
Blind labors the blind and I am
Unwilling to uncover my eyes
And if you want take your time rifle through
Find a very nice one
If there's a crease in my face over time
There's plenty more where that came from
Words frozen, will thaw when I am
Wasted, I am better shut up
And a frame is quite confining
Hang me up, hang me up
I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph
Hey, picture this
When I'm alone and the world is a fist
I am weightless
A universe, gravitate, orchestrate
I am fearless
And spin, the sky surrounding
Free from all the picture perfect
And spin the sky surrounding
Larger than life, meanwhile
I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph
Hey yeah, yeah
Oh
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah
I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph
I'm in the photograph
Hey yeah, yeahEmbed
