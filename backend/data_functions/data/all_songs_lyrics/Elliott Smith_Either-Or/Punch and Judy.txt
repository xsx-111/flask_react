Punch and Judy Lyrics
A wallflower Punch talks to Judy
In a crowded corner where anybody can listen in
But they don't read page to page or speak easy
Now, they're gonna go say the words in the wrong order again

They walk in a circle through all the sidewalk scenes
They used to be apart of one time
Now, everybody just stares and whispers
Driving around up and down Division Street
I used to like it here
It just bums me out to remember

Can't you ever treat anyone nice?
Think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice

They draw the curtain
Wait for a call
Pretty lucky if they get any kind of response at all

Can't you ever treat anyone nice?
Think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice
Gonna make the same mistake twice2Embed
