Rose Parade Lyrics
You asked me to come down and watch the parade
To march down the street like the Duracell bunny
With a wink and a wave from the cavalcade
Throwing out candy that looks like money
To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way

Said, "Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?"

Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
And I traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song

Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?

The trumpeter's obviously been drinking
'Cause he's fucking up even the simplest lines
You say it's a sight that's quite worth seeing
It's just that everyone's interest is stronger than mine
When they clean the street, I'll be the only shit that's left behind
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?2Embed
