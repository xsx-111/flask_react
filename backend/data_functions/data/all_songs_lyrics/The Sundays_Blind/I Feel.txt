I Feel LyricsI feel fine
Don't wake me up yet
O the young and the old they get everything
And it's my turn
I'm here
I'm someone to know
I'm calling the tune but
I'm losing the words
Laughingly I take the fevered applause
Of the people by the riverside
I'm walking
Walking on water
God knows why
I'm losing the words, losing the words
I am a man
Well nearly
Celebrate life
Be good to yourself
You're wrong
It's all wrong
Don't wake me like that
I was dreaming and I'd rather carry on
Give me a love and hate
On both my hands
I'll show you what I'm made of
Wasting my breath when I say that
Don't wake me like that
I was dreaming and I'm tired of everyone
Here's hoping that you'll
Go now so long leave me alone
Give me a love and hate
On both my hands
I'll show you what I'm made of
Wasting my breath when I say that
Love, hate
A pair of hands
That's where I began
Just be good
Good to yourself
I feel fine
Don't wake me up yet
Cos I feel tired
Don't be like that
We don't need to work any more now
Open that ground up and slip downEmbed
