Love Lyrics
Picture myself as a thin white child
Back to the day I was born on
They slapped me into line as it crossed my mind
I've felt better, I've felt worse

This is my life and it's all very well
But never never never again, oh
As they say "We've been robbed"
And don't you know that this time

Love, love, love
Just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that

Distance myself from the things I'd like but
Everyone has something I need
Don't let me wake up and find
All those others leaving me behind

Well if you don't have a clue about life
Then I'm happy, happy, happy to say
Neither have I although
I'm not going to shrug my shoulders & suck my thumb
This time Â´cos there's something I deserve
Love, love, love
Just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take that

Picture my house in a postcard town
Picture a bomb in the sky
History at your door
Who could ask for more?
I've felt better
I've felt better

So kill me with love
Love, love, love
Just love yourself like no one else
Love, it's enough
They can say what they like but they still can't take your
Love, love, love

Time's so scarce where I come from
Let them say what they like
Cos they still can't take your love
Love love love
Just love yourself like no one elseEmbed
