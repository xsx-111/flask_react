What Do You Think? LyricsI need a night off, but I'll take all year
Will you take any message?
I need a night off
I can't stay here
I'm sure to find a way out
Of this
I need a night off just read my lips
Are you getting the message?
I'm sick as a dog
But I'll just say this
You're as sick as I am
So what do you think about me?
What do you think about me?
Everyone around me
Is driving me mad
So here I go
Along this road
Feeling I don't want to slow down
These days of obsession
I need a night off because life's too dear
Let me show you my photographs
See me work
See me rest
See me play
O I'm sure I had it better
Back then
So what do you think about me?
I couldn't live without me
But everything about me
Is driving me mad
So here I go
Along this road
Feeling I don't want to slow
Run so hard
I lose my breath
One thing I don't want to know now
These days of obsession
Delirious
And uncertain still
And will they always stay
Uncertain still?Embed
