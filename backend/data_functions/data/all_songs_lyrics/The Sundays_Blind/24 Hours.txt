24 Hours LyricsFew true cares have I
As the world turns round
I was blind but
Now I'm still blind
Too few cares have I
As the world turns south
I was blind but
Now I'm still blind
I'd like to be 24 hours
In your house
And when the time has come to live again
I shall
And I'd like to be 24 hours
In your house
And now the time has come to live again
I shall
I liked you but that was before
Why me?
I never knew then
And I don't know now
All the things you do
All come back to you
That's why I hung back but I'll
Say what I like nowEmbed
