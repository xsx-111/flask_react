Koeeoaddi There Lyrics
The natural cards revolve ever changing
Seeded elsewhere planted in the garden fair grow trees, grow trees
Tongues of the sheer wind
Setting your foot where the sand is untrodden
The ocean that only begins
Listen a woman with a bulldozer built this house of now
Carving away the mountain whose name is your childhood home
We were trying to buy it buy it buy it
Someone was found killed there all bones bones dry bones

Earth water fire and air
Met together in a garden fair
Put in a basket bound with skin
If you answer this riddle
If you answer this riddle
You'll never begin

Born in a house where the doors shut tight
Shadowy fingers on the curtains at night
Cherry tree blossom head high snow
A busy main road where I wasn't to go
I used to sit on the garden wall
Say hello to people going by so tall
Hallo to the postman's stubbly skin
Hallo to the baker's stubbly grin
Mrs Thompson gave me a bear
Brigitte and some people lived upstairs
Skating on Happy Valley pond
Various ministers and guards stood around
The ice was nice hallo the invisible brethren
And there was a tent you played cards with the
Soldiers in, don't worry we won't send anyone
After you they screamed
But me and Licorice saw the last of them one
Misty twisty day
Across the mournful morning moor motoring away
Singing ladybird, ladybird what is your wish
Your wish is not granted unless it's a fish
Your wish is not granted unless it's a dish
A fish on a dish is that what you wish

Earth water fire and air
Met together in a garden fair
Put in a basket bound with skin
If you answer this riddle
If you answer this riddle
You'll never begin3Embed
