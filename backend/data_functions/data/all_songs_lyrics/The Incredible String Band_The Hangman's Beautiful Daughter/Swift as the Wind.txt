Swift as the Wind LyricsFor my delight
Swift as the wind flies
His chariot and wings
Shine in the light of a thousand suns
For he comes from the land of no night
He comes from the land of no night
There is no land
The night is all around my child
You must stop imagining all this
You must stop imagining all this
For your own good
Why don't you go with the rest and play downstairs
Closing my eyes
I see him so clear
The blood on his sword
Flashes so bright as it
Falls to the skulls by his feet
But his eyes they know all things
His eyes they know all
There is no blood
No-one knows all my child
You must stop imagining all this
You must stop imagining all this
For your own good
Why don't you go with the rest and play downstairs
Swift as the wind
Stay if you will now
Seeing you again will be, will be in your castle so fair
But I make take some time on the way
And I may spend some time downstairsEmbed
