Waltz of the New Moon LyricsI hear that the emperor of China used to wear iron shoes with ease
We are the tablecloth and also the table also the fable of the dancing leaves
The new moon is rising the axe of the thunder is broken
As never was, not since the flood nor yet since the world began
The new moon is shining, the angels are washing their windows
Above the years whose jumble sale goes spinning on below
Ask the snail beneath the stone, ask the stone beneath the wall
Are there any stars at all
Like an eagle in the sky, tell me if air is strong
In the floating pan pipe victories of the golden harvest
Safe in the care of the dear moon
The new moon is rising the eyelid of god is approaching
The humane train the skating raining travelling voice of certainty
The new moon is shining the harmonious hand is now holding Lord Krishna's ring
The eagle's wing the voice of mother everything
Ask the snail beneath the stone, ask the stone beneath the wall
Are there any stars at all
Like an eagle in the sky, tell me if air is strong
In the floating palaces of the spinning castle
May the fire king's daughter bring water to youEmbed
