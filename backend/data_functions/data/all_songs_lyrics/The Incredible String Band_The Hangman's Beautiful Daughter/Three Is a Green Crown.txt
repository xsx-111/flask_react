Three Is a Green Crown LyricsNot with the lips of skin nor yet with the lips of dark snow
But let the white dove sing
Of the body of life of the lover whose love is complete
Hold hands out to greet ah let not the swan be brought low
For all that is moving is moved by her hands
She is mirrored for ever in the life of the lands
In the building of thoughts in the shifting of sands
Life life remembering
Well here you are now, o now you are here
Well how has it been so far
The hair and the fur
Lemons, frankinsence, and myrhh
For all that is moving is moved by her hands
She is mirrored for ever in the life of the lands
In the building of thoughts in the shifting of sands
Let the cracked crystal raindrop be merged in the sea
Silent shining thoughtless free
But close your eyes to find the golden flower
And open them to see the sunshine shower
Where the flowers are free and the fishes ask
Ah what can water be
She beareth thought, she beareth visions
Speaking truth in contradictions
Dreams of pain, dreams of laughter
And every action follows after
O second self, o gate of the soft mystery
I'll love you if you'll love me
O guide me with the gold of Gabriel's wing
Grant me the tongue that all the earth does sing
Vibrating light, forever one the sun
The book of life is open to us
There'll be no secrets left between usEmbed
