Nightfall LyricsNightfall o river of night flow through me
Washing thoughts of the day on your waters away
For the morrow that dawns never knew me
Nightfall nightfall folding her dark locks around you
Her eyes they have found you would show you
This new dream they're holding
O sleep o come to me you who are night's daughter
And I'll give you my eyes for the colours that rise
As time's echoes reflect on your waterEmbed
