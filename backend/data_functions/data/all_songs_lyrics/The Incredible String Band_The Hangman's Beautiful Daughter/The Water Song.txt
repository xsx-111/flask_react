The Water Song LyricsWater water see the water flow
Glancing dancing see the water flow
O wizard of changes water water water
Dark or silvery mother of life
Water water holy mystery heavens daughter
Wizard of changes, teach me the lesson of flowing
God made a song when the world was new
Waters laughter sings it through
O, wizard of changes, teach me the lesson of flowing
God made a song when the world was new
Waters laughter sings it through
Wizard of changes water water waterEmbed
