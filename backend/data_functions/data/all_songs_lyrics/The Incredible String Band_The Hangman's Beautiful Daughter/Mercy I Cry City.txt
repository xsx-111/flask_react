Mercy I Cry City LyricsSince you got me here I see you're trying to steal my soul
Your army's trying so very hard to find for me a goal
But where's your quiet pastures where there's time for me to be
Nothing else but what I am that's what you seem scared to see
You cover up your emptiness with brick and noise and rush
Oh I can see and touch you but you don't owe reality much
Have mercy I cry city you're all upon my mind
Sometimes I think you keep forgetting that you don't know me
Mercy I cry city you're all upon my mind
Send another carriage chugging down your chokey tube
I hope it makes you happy 'cause it don't do my health much good
You slowly killing fumes now squeeze the lemon in my head
Make me know just what it's like for a sin drenched christian to be dead
Ah show me your glitter and your flashing neon light
You see I think that only the sun knows how to be quietly bright
Have mercy I cry city you're all upon my mind
Sometimes I think you keep forgetting that you don't know me
Mercy I cry city you're all upon my mind
Hey, city, what you been doing?
All these years what you been doing?
Who would believe that what you been doing
Would make such a ruin of you?
Hey, city, what you been doing?
All these years what you been doing?
Who would believe that what you been doing
Would make such a ruin of you?
Tell me cityEmbed
