Witches Hat LyricsCertainly the children have seen them
In quiet places where the moss grows green
Coloured shells jangle together
The wind is cold, the year is old, the trees whisper together
And bend in the wind, they lean
Next week a monkey is coming to stay
If I was a witches' hat
Sitting on her head like a paraffin stove
I'd fly away and be a bat
Across the air I would rove
Stepping like a tightrope walker
Putting one foot after another
Wearing black cherries for ringsEmbed
