Alone Lyrics
I don't want to be alone anymore
I don't want to be alone, shut that door

This was just a silly game, girl
That we are playing
I will even take the blame, oh
I'm so ashamed
Don't go, listen
They said that you and I would be together from now on
But if you walk out the door, girl, I won't see you no more

I don't want to be alone anymore
Shut that door

This was just a silly game, girl, we were playing, playing
Hey, woo woo
I will even take the blame
Hear what I'm saying, child, I'm so ashamed

I don't wanna be alone anymore, oh, oh, oh
I don't wanna be alone
Somebody pick me up off the floorEmbed
