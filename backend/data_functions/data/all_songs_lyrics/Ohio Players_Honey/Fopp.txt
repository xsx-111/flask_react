Fopp Lyrics
Fopped last night and the night before
I had to fopp outside and then I went indoors
Fopped so hard I made the people roar
They stood back and gave me all the floor
I did the fopp, fopp
They wouldn’t let me stop
I kept on foppin’ and rockin’
Had the whole house hoppin’, I was

Foppin', the way it makes you groove, everybody was
Foppin', everywhere you go, do all your
Shoppin', rockin' to the floor, everybody was foppin’

Fopp with me and I’ll fopp with you
Foppin’ is the brand new thing to do
Fopped three days and I lost my shoe
I fopped so tough they had to make some room, yeah
Raise your leg and then you hump your back
Do your thing, don’t you give no slack
Shake your hips and then you turn around, round
Don't you fopp it up, you got to fopp it down
Fopp me right, don’t you fopp me wrong
We’ll be here foppin’ all night long, girl
I’m too short, baby, and you’re too tall
But when we’re foppin’ that don’t mean a thing at all
Listen here
Foppin', the way it makes you go, everybody was
Foppin', everywhere you go, do all your
Shoppin', rockin' to the floor, everybody was foppin’

I'm too young, child, and you're too old
But that don't mean that you got no soul, listen here
Rich can fopp, and so can the Pope
You can fopp until you're ninety-four

Funkin' and foppin', don't ever let 'em stop ya
Keep on foppin' and foppin', you'll have the whole house rockin'
Keep on foppin' and foppin', until your knees are rockin'
Keep on foppin' and foppin', hey, hey, hey
Hey hey heyEmbed
