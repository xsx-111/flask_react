Same Ghost Every Night LyricsWhen you're on your own
Spread out on the mat, dead
The highway's endless drone
Something familiar
And how we love the seasons that hide in our stomachs
That howl and howl and howl as if dropped from a great height
And I fought the hours that hide in the kitchen
They drag him, drag him, drag him into the black night
Oh, dropped from a great height
Oh, dropped from a great height
It was strange, constant blue
And the same ghost every night
It was strange, constant blue
And the same ghost every night
I go walking just to find
My own breath, my own breath through the path
I go walking just to find
My own breath, my own breath through the path
Oh, dropped from a great height
Oh, dropped from a great height
It was strange, constant blue
And the same ghost every night
It was strange, constant blue
And the same ghost every night
I go walking just to find
My own breath, my own breath through the path
I go walking just to find
My own breath, my own breath through the path
We are raised up very high
We are raised up very high
My own, my own, my own, my own, my own, my own
My own, my own, my own, my own
My own, my own, my own, my own, my own, my own, my
My own, my own, my own, my own, my own, my own
My own, my own, my own, my own breathEmbed
