Modern World Lyrics
I'm not in love with the modern world
I'm not in love with the modern world
It was a torch to drive the savages back to the trees
Modern world has motorways
And automation in a senseless chain
While the people go out and the people come home again

It's got lies to fill up your eyes
And a nighttime of red skies
And from my bed, the sound of haunting, hissing in the vent
Modern world don't ask why
Cause modern world will build things high
Lonely hearts, canyons filled with life

Modern world, I'm not pleased to meet you
You just bring me down
Modern world, I'm not pleased to meet you
You just bring me down
Modern world, I'm not pleased to meet you
You just bring me down
Modern world, I'm not pleased to meet you
You just bring me down
Modern world, I'm not pleased to meet you
You just bring me down1Embed
