We Built Another World Lyrics
At the party we got chained at the wrist
Outside thereâ€™s girls and falling bricks
It's not gonna be just only a kiss
Everyone's disguised just a little bit

I had a bad bad time tonight
I had a bad bad time tonight
'Cause bad things happen in the night

Where we built another world
Stars around you, here comes the night time
Where we built another world
Evening time

I made a loud sound and shake some teeth
Outside the lights pinned the ghost to the street
It's not gonna be just only a kiss
Everyone's disguised just a little bit

I had a bad bad time tonight
I had a bad bad time tonight
'Cause bad things happen in the night
Where we built another world
Stars around you, here comes the night time
Where we built another world
Evening time

Where we built another world
Hanging ghosts from the trees and that's what I saw
Where we built another world
Hanging ghosts from the trees and that's what I saw
Where we built another world
Where we built another world
Where we built another world
Here comes the night timeEmbed
