Grounds for Divorce Lyrics
You said you hate the sound of the buses on the ground
You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
Said, "Pretend it's whales a-keeping their voices down"
Such worthy grounds for divorce, I know

On the radio and the bouncing body drone
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone
Said, "Look at the clouds, it's a show all on its own"
Such worthy grounds for divorce, I know

But the darling is dead
We hit it on the head
It looked like a wedding cake
But the darling is dead
We hit it on the head
It looked like a newlywed

But I look at the lovers and the way they stand
And the way they move and the way they move their hands
And look at their babies and their tiny little hands
And the way they get loved and the way they get loved, oh
Oh, look at the lovers and the way they stand
And the way they move and the way they move and the way move their hands
You said you hate the sound of the buses on the ground
You said you hate the way they scrape their brakes all over town
Said, "Pretend it's whales a-keeping their voices down"
Such worthy grounds for divorce, I know

Looked like a newlywed

On the radio and the bouncing body drone
Found eighteen reasons I can't pick up on the phone
Said, "Look at the clouds, it's a show all on its own"
Such worthy grounds such worthy grounds for divorce, I knowEmbed
