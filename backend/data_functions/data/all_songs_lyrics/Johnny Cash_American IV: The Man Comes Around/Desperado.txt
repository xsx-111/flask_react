Desperado Lyrics
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
You been out riding fences for so long now
Oh, you're a hard one
But I know that you've got your reasons
These things that are pleasing you
Can hurt you somehow

Don't you draw the queen of diamonds, boy
She'll beat you if she's able
Know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me, some fine things
Have been laid upon your table
But you only want the things that you can't get

Desperado, oh, you aren't getting any younger
Your pain and your hunger, they're driving you home
And freedom, oh freedom
Well, that's just some people talking
Your prison is walking
Through this world all alone

And don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow, the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losing all your highs and lows
Isn't it funny how the feeling
Goes away
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences, and open the gate
It may be raining, but there's a rainbow above you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
You better let somebody love you
Before it's too late3Embed
