Sam Hall Lyrics
Well, my name it is Sam Hall, Sam Hall
Yes, my name it is Sam Hall, it is Sam Hall
My name it is Sam Hall and I hate you, one and all
And I hate you, one and all
Damn your eyes!

I killed a man, they said, so they said
I killed a man, they said, so they said
I killed a man, they said and I smashed in his head
And I left him laying dead
Damn his eyes!

But swinging, I must go, I must go
A swinging, I must go, I must go
A swinging, I must go while you critters down below
Yell up, "Sam, I told you so!"
Damn your eyes!

I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd
I saw Molly in the crowd, in the crowd
I saw Molly in the crowd and I hollered, right out loud
Hey there Molly, aren't you proud
Damn your eyes!

Then the Sheriff, he came too, he came too
Ah, yeah, the Sheriff, he came too, he came too
The Sheriff, he come too and he said, "Sam, how are you?"
And I said, "Well, Sheriff, how are *you*?
Damn your eyes!"

My name is Samuel, Samuel
My name is Samuel, Samuel
My name is Samuel, and I'll see you all in hell!
And I'll see you all in hell!
Damn your eyes!2Embed
