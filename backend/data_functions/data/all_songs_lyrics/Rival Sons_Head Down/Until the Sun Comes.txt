Until the Sun Comes LyricsI know you think you've heard it all before
But you'll be telling stories of tonight
Get it left, get it right, get it up and down
And through it all I'll be staring at your eyes
And we can dance
We can dance
Until the sun comes up
And we can dance
We can dance
Until the sun comes up
Until the sun comes
And if you don't believe what I say
I'll kiss your eyes if you're in doubt
Get it left, get it right, get it up and down
This building might burn but we'll be making out
And we can dance
We can dance
Until the sun comes up
And we can dance
We can dance
Until the sun comes up
Until the sun comes
Don't try to hide, 'cause I'll be lookin' out
And we can dance
We can dance
Until the sun comes up
And we can dance
We can dance
Until the sun comes up
And we can dance
We can dance
Until the sun comes up
And we can dance
We can dance
Until the sun comes up
Until the sun comesEmbed
