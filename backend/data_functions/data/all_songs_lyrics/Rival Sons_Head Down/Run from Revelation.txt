Run from Revelation LyricsBack when I was a young man
I used to be a hard one
I could whip any beast
That stood my path
Now I'm long in the tooth
And I only seek comfort
My days pass like hours
And the world moves too fast
If I could run from Revelation
I'd run straight back to Genesis
Cry, I want to do it again
Cry, I want to do it again
Back when I was a young man
I used to be a strong one
I could stand through the storm
And command it to pass
Now I'm long in the tooth
And I'm telling you children
You'd better learn some respect
Because I don't need your sass
If I could run from Revelation
I'd run straight back to Genesis
Cry, I want to do it again
Cry, I want to do it againEmbed
