Keep On Swinging Lyrics
One day my prayers are gonna be answered
So long I been hungry for something else
Where there's a will there's a way
I work hard cause at the end of the day
The Lord helps those who help themselves

Hey, hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'

Right now somebody's counting my money
So much they can't see the top of the stack
Where there's a will there's a way
Money's gonna find my hand one day and
When it does, I ain't looking back

Hey, hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'
Hey I keep my head down but I keep on swingin'Embed
