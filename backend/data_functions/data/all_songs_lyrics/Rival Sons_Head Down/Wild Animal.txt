Wild Animal LyricsShe's too sweet for me and I can't even taste it
She gets on my tongue and I try not to waste it
She's too good to me and I can't barely take it
And she says I'm good and I just get irritated
Ooow ooowwwooo
You're playing with a wild animal
Ooow ooowwwooo
You know I'm never gonna do what I'm told
Ooow ooowwwooo
You're playing with a wild animal
Ooow ooowwwooo
You know I'm never gonna do what I'm told, what I'm told
A wild, A wild
She's too rich for me I know I'll never make it
And she takes me to a party and I just get faded
She's too hot for me when she's standing there naked
But I get so high that I can't appreciate it
Ooow ooowwwooo
You're playing with a wild animal
Ooow ooowwwooo
You know I'm never gonna do what I'm told
Ooow ooowwwooo
You're playing with a wild animal
Ooow ooowwwooo
You know I'm never gonna do what I'm told, what I'm told
A wild, A wild
Ooow ooowwwooo
You're playing with a wild animal
Ooow ooowwwooo
You know I'm never gonna do what I'm told
Ooow ooowwwooo
You're playing with a wild animal
Ooow ooowwwooo
You know I'm never gonna do what I'm told, what I'm told
A wild, A wild
A wild animal
I'm never, I'm never, I'm never, never do what I'm toldEmbed
