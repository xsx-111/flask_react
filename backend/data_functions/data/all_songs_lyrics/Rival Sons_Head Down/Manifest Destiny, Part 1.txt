Manifest Destiny, Part 1 LyricsOut on the hunt for Tatanka
The buffalo are only miles away
You see the tracks from the army's wagons
Headed for your camp from yesterday
You know we're dealing with godless men
You know we're dealing with godless men
You know we're dealing with godless men
You know we're dealing with godless men
He killed your horse but you made it home
To burning bodies around that lay
Chanumpa broke and you're all alone
Help me, Aho Mitake Oyasin
You know we're dealing with godless men
You know we're dealing with godless men
You know we're dealing with godless men
You know we're dealing with godless menEmbed
