You Want To LyricsYou got me right where you want me
You got me out on the street
I'm cold and I'm lonely
I need your company
I'm so sorry
This time I mean it
I'm so sorry (I'm so sorry)
This time I mean it
Let me in
I know you want to
I see my dog in the window
Records on my lawn
You're out spending my dough
Just to get your hair done
I'm so sorry
This time I mean it (This time I mean it)
I'm so sorry (I'm so sorry)
This time I mean it
Let me in
I know you want to
Now I understand
One of us had to draw the line
But I know you need a natural man
The world is crawling with women
None of them love like mine
I said, let me in
I know you hear me, let me in
Let me in
I know you hear me, let me in
Let me in
Let me in
Let me in
Let me in
I'm so sorry (Oh yeah)
This time I mean it
I'm so sorry (Baby, this time I'm sorry)
This time I mean it (Don't you know, don't you know that I mean it)
Let me in
I know you want toEmbed
