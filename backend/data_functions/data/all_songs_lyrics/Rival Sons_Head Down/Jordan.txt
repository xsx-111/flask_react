Jordan Lyrics
The wolves look to the moon
And the ocean to the sky
I've looked to you my whole life
Now I have to say goodbye
But to say that I've lost you
Is a selfish thing to say
I've never seen nothing as beautiful
As watching you slip away

I'd rather see you go in the arms of your angels
Than to stay right here with me
I'll meet you on the other side of the Jordan
Now let your soul go free

You did it all with feeling
And failure, you took it gracefully
You said third star to the right
Straight on until morning
When you need me, you know that's where I'll be
Now the rest of my life without you
Right now it's hard to conceive
You said, "Don't cry for me now
You've got to remember
There is no death for those that believe"
I'd rather see you go in the arms of your angels
Than to keep you right here with me
I'll meet you on the other side of the Jordan
Now let your soul go free
Let your soul go free

Meet you on the other side of the Jordan
Now let your soul be free
Rather see you go in the arms of your angels
Than to keep you right here with me
On the other side of the Jordan
Now let your soul go free
In the arms of your angels
Than to keep you right here with me
Meet you on the other side of the Jordan
Than to keep you right here with me
Rather see you go in the arms of your angels
Let your soul be free
Meet you on the other side of the Jordan
Let your soul be free
Rather see you go in the arms of your angels
Than to keep you right here with me1Embed
