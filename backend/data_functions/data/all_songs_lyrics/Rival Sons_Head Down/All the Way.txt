All the Way LyricsWhen I was young
Sometimes I'd be a bad boy
My pop would sit me down
He'd put his belt back on tight
He'd say apologize to your sister
Treat the women right
And I'd say mm-hmm
And he'd give me that look
And I'd say yes sir
Well that happened many more times
Due to various reasons
They said I was a colourful boy
I didn't play ball
So I couldn't get the chicks
Until I picked up a guitar
And learned a couple licks
And it went...
Well it didn't sound exactly like that
But anyhow, you get the picture
But I found my focus
And I found my steam
For the rest of my life
I'm gonna fight for this dream you know
This time I'm going all the way
This time I'm going all the way
This time I'm going all the way
This time I'm going all the way
And after that everything changed
I got what I wanted
But my hunger stayed the same
Now that I'm older
I've still got to learn things twice
When we first met
You were looking for a man
I was acting like a boy
And you gave me the hand
And you said mm-hmm
But I was so used to getting what I wanted
Mm-hmm
Well that happened many more times
Due to various reasons
Usually whiskey
But you gave me another chance
And this time it's good
I'm so down for romance
And treating you like I should
And you say, "Baby, baby"
Well you don't exactly say that
But anyhow, you get the picture
But we got our focus and we got our steam
For the rest of our lives
We're gonna fight for this dream you know
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way

So if you get it wrong, go back and do it right
Find out what you love, and hold on to it tight
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the way
This time we're going all the wayEmbed
