Manifest Destiny, Part 2 LyricsYou know we watched your soldiers
From the hills last night
And we'll keep on watching
Until the morning light
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
Do it for the dead
I can see the eagle
On way up high
If I take my journey
I'm gonna shoot through the sky
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
Do it for the dead
You know my wife and children
Had hair so black
Now there's nothing you can do
That will bring them back
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawn
We're taking lives at dawnEmbed
