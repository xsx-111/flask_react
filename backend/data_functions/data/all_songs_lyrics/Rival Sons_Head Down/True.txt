True LyricsWhen I built this bed
I did it with my own two hands
For I knew that one day
You would come along
And make this home
No longer alone
My own true love
When I come in from the fields
Youâ€™ll wash my body and sit next to me
We will have two children
They will call you mama
My own true love
We will lift our voices
We will pray together
My own true love
My own true loveEmbed
