The Heist LyricsI'm not a violent man
But I can't seem to cope
I tie a dangerous knot
To the end of my rope
Baby, baby don't worry
I'm coming home
Home with the money
Baby, baby don't worry
I'm coming home
Home with the money
I've got four mouths to feed
And a woman in doubt
I'm walking in with a gun
And I'll be rich coming out
Baby, baby don't worry
I'm coming home
Home with the money
Baby, baby don't worry
I'm coming home
Home with the money
I slip the paper to the teller
I've got my sunglasses on
Stay calm is what I tell her
That's when I hear the alarm
Baby, baby don't worry
I'm coming home
Home with the money
Baby, baby don't worry
I'm coming home
Home with the money
Baby, baby don't worry
I'm coming home
Home with the money
Baby, baby don't worry
I'm coming home
Home with the moneyEmbed
