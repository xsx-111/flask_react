Put The Freaks Up Front Lyrics
So you're suffering
I know it hurts a lot when it's the first time
Whenever I begin, make sure to keep my empathy inside
The harder that it gets, the more the company will do you all in
Here comes another hit
(This isn't dying)
It's just a slow way of falling

You place your frown
Heavily down on me, and
Try make me weak
Too lame to speak, I

Only ‘cause of love
Love’s the only thing that makes me do this
(Push me, don't calm me
Can’t win, just blame me
We're on the edge of something, something)
No power from above
You do it to yourself; I'll help you through this
(That says if you’re able
Survive this, we’ve made it
It's out of my system
It hit while our playing)
There's beauty in this place
It took me all these years to realise
(It helped me, I'm staying
These blows mark a new deal
The truth is, the threat's real)
Hype up and go hatch a plan
(Do you know what this means to me?)
Tag onto someone who can believe it
(You've respect and no dignity, do you?)
Noble designs slip away
(With your backs to the outside you'll burn)
Slide into morbid decay
I'm leaving
(Your bubble won't block out the sun)

Come and feel what it does to me
So much more than fantasy
Put your panic on a hold
Amplify your very soul and keep breathing

So you're suffering
I know it hurts a lot when it's the first time
Whenever I begin, make sure to keep my empathy inside
(Push me, don't calm me
Can’t win, just blame me
We're on the edge of something, something)
The agony preserved
Your eyes are slowly losing all their softness
(That says if you’re able
Survive this, we’ve made it
It's out of my system
It hit while our playing)
The alcohol and thyme
So good, must be a crime
I see you’re fighting
(It helped me, I'm staying
These blows mark a new deal
The truth is, the threat's real)Embed
