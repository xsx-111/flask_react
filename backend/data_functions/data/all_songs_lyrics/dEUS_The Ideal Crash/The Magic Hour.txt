The Magic Hour LyricsI had a plan, was all made up
An angel was sent, for keeping all troubles away
'Cause lady and I, we could not stop
As cool as a sigh, as volatile as something you say
I had a dream, a simple plot
I held out my hand as if she'd never pushed it away
The sun is still there, except it's not
Beside her I care to linger even though it's not safe
Godawful I adore you
Angels were there before you
Nothing can stop what we do
It's breaking us up in two
Hey maybe should we ask it
Could our friends be worthier
Like things we trust for if we must
We must burn them
And burn them good, real friends they would
Be understanding if it came to us
And us we must we must turn to
The God of small things
The God of small things
I had a plan, was all made up
As good it was then the magic hour seemed to be fading
'Cause lady and I we could not stop
As cool as a sigh, as murderous as something you say
Godawful I adore you
Angels were there before you
Nothing can stop what we do
It's breaking us up in two
There is room if you can trust|
For anyone like usEmbed
