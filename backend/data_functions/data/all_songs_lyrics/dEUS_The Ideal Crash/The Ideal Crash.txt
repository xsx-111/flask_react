The Ideal Crash Lyrics
Stay by my side; it's over
The ride isn't what I told you
The painkiller side of this life
Is to not look behind; it's over
I have been told about longing
A feeling so old, it's dead
I must have been misled
So stay by my side; I'm sorry

I'm drawing myself the ideal crash
But I know I won't believe me
There'll be a time you'll leave me

Stay by my side, it's sexy
The way that we talk about stuff
The way that we laugh with love
The way that we're falling off

Crash
Your life’s been sucking ‘cause you wanna mess around
Can anybody down you with a crash?
Another way of saying that you’d like to make it up as you move along
If it's a lot, show them what you got
Stay by my side; I want you
Continue the theme that's us
Even though it's only lust
The painkiller side of this life

I'm drawing myself the ideal crash
And I know I won't believe me
How can a man kill gently?
How long before it's all done?
How can he leave someone?
How can he do it softly?

Crash
Your life’s been sucking ‘cause you wanna mess around
Can anybody down you with a crash?
Another way of saying that you’d like to make it up as you move along
If it's a lot, show them what you got
Crash
You're gonna go to hell with a certain inclination
Try and make it sell and then you crash
You're gonna have to take yourself out of circulation, into something else
If it's a lot, show them what you got
Right now I need my hands, to cover this shit up
I need my eyes to see were I'm going
And I need someone
Stay by my side, it's sexy
The way that we talk about stuff
The way that we laugh with love
The way that we're falling offEmbed
