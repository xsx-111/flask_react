One Advice, Space LyricsWasted and wounded, erased with the night
One man's conviction is another man's lie
I said you could find me where the nighthawks fly
And I'll be there a while, yes I'll be there a while
Dustpaper coupons, there's a guy by the door
He said: "What makes me quit makes you go back for more"
This place isn't real man, this girl is a whore
Watch me fall to the floor, but I'll go back for more
Sometimes I wander
So I finally found you, and I lost you to love
No it sure wasn't this I was... Thinkin' of
Put your silhouette on me and your sweetness above
And I can't get enough, no I can't get enough
Wasted and wounded, this ain't no way to die
One man's cold turkey is another man's high
I said you could find me where the nighthawks fly
And I'll be there a while, yes I'll be there a while
Sometimes I wander
Down on the floor, got a closer look at hell
You see, somebody pushed me, I just pretended that I fell
I said that I adored you, but I could never tell
For all that I know I'll be gone when you go
Music went through you and took you to a place
There ain't no doubt you'll find a welcoming embrace
I said that I loved you, another hawk in space
And you'll be there for a while and I'll be there for a while
Finding my own inarticulate prose
Weirding out strangers and laughing at those
Jaundiced and jaded postured and posed
Not that we're special, it's just that we're
Closing in on a place where we might get to be
Living real people regularly
Send you some stuff and be good like you asked
Must promise remember the sixth and the last
Thanks for anonymous invisible
Take us away
Thanks for not breaking like they wanted
Take us away
Wake me and say "Take us away"Embed
