Instant Street Lyrics
You're probably right, seen from your side, that I have been lucky
But I've been meaning to crack all week
Yes, I've been involved, but it never resolved to anything shocking
And pain's playing yoyo in my body as we speak
And now I’ve found something to look for
And I can't decide
‘Cause I might find to stroll behind is better than to score
Just like I did before

It wouldn't be true, not towards you, to say that I'm staying
When on every single impulse, on every other move I react
Cause in any old creek, with changing technique, you'll see me playing
After any old motherfucking blow I'll be back

We turned away from instant stuff
Our cracking codes were breaking up
Our words were sucked out it made them clean
And after lowness say it
And after more let it be known
Our codes are grown into something mean

You're probably right, as for tonight, you're making me nervous
What is it you want me to be thinking of?
I'll put on a movie, I'll play something groovy as a matter of service
And I'll chuckle when you smile as a matter of love
And you know it's not my style to be giving up now
This pain in my side, I had enough
This time I go for instant street
This life's a soulless excuse for all abuse and parenthesis
The flyspecked windows and the stinking lobbies, they'll remain
All the same, all the same

This time I go
This time I go1Embed
