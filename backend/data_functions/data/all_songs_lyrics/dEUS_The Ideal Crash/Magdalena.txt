Magdalena Lyrics
You drive too fast
Can you please shut up
I'll call the police
If you don't stop
You're just trying to scare me
You want me to know
That you're not this precious
Little thing you hold
You're afraid you say (and you're never sure)
For the coming day (if what you've seen before)
And I'm not that handsome (is what you'll see again)
Anyway (In remembering)
But I'm feeling good
And if you don't exist
You're still one illusion
That I can't resist

Now you're holding back
And I'm holding on
Heaven knows what you want
'Cause kicks like these
They're coming fast
But watching how long they last
It's a funny time
To fall in love
Feels like something pulled me up
To see me fall right off
You drive too fast
But I don't care
Wherever's fine
Just take me there

Now I'm holding back
And you're moving on
Heaven knows what I want
'Cause on a day like this
I'd believe anything
I don't know where to begin

One for your coming
Two for your shoes
Your buccaneer loving
And suicide moods
I wanna move
Don't figure out much
Into the new
Out of the blue, out of the darkness
Out of the blue, out of the darkness
Out of the blue, out of the darkness
Out of the blue, out of the darkness
Out of the blue, out of the darkness
Out of the blue, out of the darkness
Into the new, out of the blacknessEmbed
