Dream Sequence #1 LyricsMy little dreamone, you O. K.?
I'm thinking about you everyday
Along with your smile, I took my belongings
Along with the sunshine, I went away
There is a space here, there is a void
I need to find, a little more time gimme time
Of all of the fuckups that I do
I've saved up the best one for you
Heaven and moonshine, you gotta be kidding
You wanted to give it a try and I didn't
I never wanted to be looking back
I need to find a little more insight gimme insight
I'm getting better everyday
I just don't care what they say
People are talking, they were talking before
They don't even know who we are anymore
I never wanted to be looking back
I need to find, some peace of mind gimme peace of mind
My little dreamone, you O. K.?
I'm thinking about you everyday
Along with your smile, I took my belongings
Along with the sunshine, I went away
There is a space here, there is a void
I need to find, a little more time gimme time
Whispered in
The way you cling
We find made
Our special thing
Stone Madly I
Hellbent on my
Coming for youEmbed
