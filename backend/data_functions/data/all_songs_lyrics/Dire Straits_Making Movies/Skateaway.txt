Skateaway Lyrics
I seen a girl on a one-way corridor
Stealing down a wrong-way street
For all the world like an urban toreador
She had wheels on, on her feet
Well, the cars do the usual dances
Same old cruise and the kerbside crawl
But the rollergirl, she's taking chances
They just love to see her take them all

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

Hallelujah, here she comes
Queen rollerball
Enchant√©, what can I say?
Don't care at all
You know, she used to have to wait around
She used to be the lonely one
But now that she can skate around town
She's the only one

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud
She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
And the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long, all night long

She tortures taxi drivers just for fun
She like to read their lips
Says, "Toro, toro, taxi, see you tomorrow, my son"
I swear she let a big truck grease her hip
She got her own world in the city
You can't intrude on her, no, no, no
She got her own world in the city
Because the city's been so rude to her

No fears alone at night, she's sailing through the crowd
In her ears, the phones are tight, and the music's playing loud

She gets rock and roll and a rock and roll station
And a rock and roll dream
She's making movies on location
She don't know what it means
But the music make her want to be the story
And the story was whatever was the song, what it was
Rollergirl, don't worry
D.J. play the movies all night long, all night long
Come slipping and sliding
Yeah, life's a roller ball
Slipping and a-sliding
Skateaway, that's all
Skateaway
Shala, shalay, hey hey, skateaway
Now shala, shalay, hey hey, skateaway
She's singing, "Shala, shalay, hey hey"
Skateaway
Shala, shalayEmbed
