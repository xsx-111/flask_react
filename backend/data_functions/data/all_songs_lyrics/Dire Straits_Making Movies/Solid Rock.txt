Solid Rock Lyrics
Well now, take a look at that
I made a castle in the sand
Saying this is where it's at, y'all
Couldn't understand now
If I realised that the chances were slim
How come I'm so surprised when the tide rolled in

Gonna live, solid rock
Gonna live, solid rock
Wanna give, I don't wanna be blocked
I'm gonna live on solid rock

Well, I'm sick of potential
I'm sick of vanity now
I'm sticking to essential reality now
I don't know what's worse
Try to make a silk purse
Living an illusion in confusion

Gonna live, solid rock
Gonna live, solid rock
Gonna live, I don't wanna be blocked now
I'm gonna live on solid rock
Ya know a house of cards
Never built for shock
You could blow it down in any kind of weather
Now you take two solid blocks, two solid rocks
You know they're gonna stick
Yeah they're gonna stick together


Yeah, because the heart that you break
That's the one that you rely on
The bed that you make
That's the one you got to lie on
When you point your finger 'cause your plan fell through
You got three more fingers pointing back at you, yeah

Gonna live, solid rock
I'm gonna live, solid rock
I wanna give, I don't wanna be blocked
I'm gonna live on solid rock

Rock, solid rock, rock, rock, solid rock
I wanna give, I don't wanna be blocked
I'm gonna live on solid, solid, solid, solid rock
Rock, rock, rock, rock, solid rock
Solid rock!Embed
