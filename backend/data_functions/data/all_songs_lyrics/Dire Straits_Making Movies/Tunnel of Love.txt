Tunnel of Love Lyrics

Getting crazy on the waltzers
But it's the life that I choose
Hey, sing about the sixblade, sing about the switchback
And a torture tattoo
And I've been riding on a ghost train
Where the cars they scream and slam
And I don't know where I'll be tonight
But I'd always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces
I've seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races, yeah
Just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever
Said: "Let it rock and let it roll"
I had the one arm bandit fever
There was an arrow through my heart and my soul

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love
It's just the danger, danger when you're riding at your own risk
She said: "You are the perfect stranger"
She said: "Baby, let's keep it like this"
It's just a cake walk, twisting baby, yeah, step right up and say:
"Hey Mister, give me two, give me two now, 'cos any two can play"

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

Well, it's been money for muscle on another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to, just to make it big
And rockaway, rockaway
Oh, rockaway, rockaway

And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Hey girl, it looks so pretty to me
Just like it always did
Oh, like the Spanish City to me
When-a we were kids
Check it out!


She took off a silver locket
She said: "Remember me by this"
She put her hand in my pocket
I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of dust and diesel
I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough
But something must have made me stay

And the big wheel keep on turning
Neon burning up above
And I'm just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Yeah, love, love, love
On the tunnel of love
Oh, love, love

And now I'm searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway, rockaway
Rockaway, rockaway
From Cullercoats and Whitley Bay
Out to rockaway
And girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
Girl, it looks so pretty to me
Like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me
When we were kids
