The Road of Bones LyricsAnd morning Ô¨Ånds my night's work
Lights the remnants on display
I do not seek forgiveness, nothing to absolve
For now the need is met, I almost hate myself
Almost but not quite
They survey the frozen scene
The cold countenance of hell
And they hang their heavy heads
I'm seen as death itself
Fear that holds this fragile town extends for miles around
I've taken all control for I am someone now
The shadow cross my face
All the signs of my mistakes
Shallow graves I mark with stones
As I walk the road of bones
We dance our unkind, compelling dance
The arcane ritual observed
I will see this whole thing through if I just keep my nerve
All the journeys I've retraced
To return me to this place
I do not walk alone
As I build the road of bones
Their dumb shock of reaction's what it's for
Full of nothing and I won't be ignored
They got sirens and all that nervous force
They concede a good death's it's own reward
The shadow cross my face
All the futures laid to waste
Shallow graves I mark with stones
As I walk the road of bonesEmbed
