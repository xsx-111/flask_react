Ten Million Demons LyricsIf I could make believe what you can see, I'd stop it where it starts
Because you buried it, it bears your name, tears your world apart
The accidental life, the evidence evolves
Enough to cancel out real confidence
And in the end you save me, come another day, get away
Where is my dreamtime now?
Ten million demons breaking on through way down low
It's the hardest part of bearing scars that cut me when I fall
Knowing I alone will carry them and I must hide them all
Get yourself unwrecked, a chance to resurrect
Nothing more than this will happen unless you make it
Where is my dreamtime now?
Ten million demons breaking on through way down low
Dreaming more than some, no earthly good will come
Poison ivy, Penny Black, Jack O'Lantern's back
Spring-heeled spinning wheel, made the wrong deal
Couldn't make it worse
Take it back, take it back, take it back
Where is my dreamtime now?
Ten million demons breaking on through way down lowEmbed
