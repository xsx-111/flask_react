Knucklehead LyricsAnd I can't go outside any time of day
Soon as I'm revived, thoughts take flight
Sometimes I'm dead inside, sometimes I'm out of sight
Knives deeply flawed cut the cord, I was sworn right in
Lives spun around, cradled down in distortion
Hopeless, useless, worthless
Hateful, vengeful, numbskull
Somebody out there decided I never should have got born
Deciphered the warnings
Stopped and found it's a long way down
Toll taking, core shaking
Not a day goes by I'm unanaesthetised
Words I can't command, let alone understand
Novocaine attack, never going back to lawless insane insomniacs
Special decision heavyweight, let me in, I'll asphyxiate
Impossible universe in my way, these are the blues I can't escape
Kucklehead, one unlucky drop and I can make the noises stop
And I don't condone this, any answer I'll deny
Time when we're allowed to say goodbye
Though you were seldom true, sometimes you fell too ard
Irreversible change in circumstances, keep my perspective all I can
This is enough it's serious, wake up the stark interiors
Unorthodox end to self-restraint, tell myself mental blocks they ain't
Knucklehead, keep your heart intact, secretive mad amnesiacEmbed
