Hardcore LyricsSituation's now understood
Indications all not so good
Problems contain contradictions
Take a bullet and fly where there are no restrictions
Pulled right out of context
Some pale, emotional pretext
Never let it in, it's airtight
Tell yourself again it's all right
Last one to leave is the firstborn
Hardcore identity gets careworn
There's no strategy
No means to take the weight off me
Constrained by anxiety, consoled by belief
Saved your sorry skin
I hauled you from the broken wreckage
All gone, from this point on
Instead I stay deadEmbed
