From the Outside In LyricsColliding highs, the slender sky, descend into empty spaces
Sensational wasted fall from grace
They'll never give alternatives the longer you live without it
It's all about what you learn to hate
In your unaltered state, you found yourself too late
I carve your name with razor blades to feel like a decade younger
Insatiable hunger from within
Accept that poison skin from the outside in
Whenever I look down and when I throw my weight around
The unintended consequences die
Nobody said instead of dead, I'd feel I was wild and futile
I never knew blood could run so cold
Accept that poison skin from the outside in
Whenever I look down and when I throw my weight around
The empty-handed meet with something worse
A hand of narrow bone leads me on
Among the fallen stones into the night less known
Inside the needle veins, the blood is drained
I lie unrestrained and breaking down alone
This barren centigrade, the choices made from secrets best left kept
However long I've slept
The absence reconciled, the wrong denial is seen through hostile eyes
I'm Waking up, I'm better dead
Arm yourself, defend no-one else
Far inside, you're mine
Live again for if not now, when?
This is not the end
Your life is compromised, most of it was
All your endeavour lies lostEmbed
