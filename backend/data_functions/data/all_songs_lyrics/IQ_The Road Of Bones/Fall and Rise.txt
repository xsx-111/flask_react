Fall and Rise LyricsThe undecided voices circle down
The conversations all but done
Stake your claim, drown in flame
Still appointing blame
The only answer I could hear escaped me
Among the lives I couldn't trust anyone
Even so it's hard to know what was here before
Futures are calling, all around
Over the boundaries, past defences
When it consumes me, love is lost
Love is lost again
Believe enough and I'll be found alive
The undecided voices sail over sundown
Fall and rise, something dies many miles from homeEmbed
