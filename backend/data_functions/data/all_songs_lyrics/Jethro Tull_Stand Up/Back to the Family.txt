Back to the Family LyricsMy telephone wakes me in the morning
Have to get up to answer the call
So I think I'll go back to the family
Where no one can ring me at all
Living this life has its problems
So I think that I'll give it a break
Oh, I'm going back to the family
'Cause I've had about all I can take
Master's in the counting house
Counting all his money
Sister's sitting by the mirror
She thinks her hair looks funny
And here am I thinking to myself
Just wond'ring what things to do
I think I enjoyed all my problems
Where I did not get nothing for free
Oh, I'm going back to the family
Doing nothing is bothering me
I'll get a train back to the city
That soft life was getting me down
There's more fun away from the family
Get some action when I pull into town
Everything I do is wrong
What the hell was I thinking?
Phone keeps ringing all day long
I got no time for thinking
And every day has the same old way
Of giving me too much to doEmbed
