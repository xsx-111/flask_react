Reasons for Waiting LyricsWhat a sight for my eyes to see you in sleep
Could it stop the sunrise hearing you weep?
You're not seen, you're not heard, but I stand by my word
Came a thousand miles just to catch you while you're smiling
What a day for laughter and walking at night
Me following after, your hand holding tight
And the memory stays clear with the song that you hear
If I can but make the words awaken the feeling
What a reason for waiting and dreaming of dreams
So here's hoping you've faith in impossible schemes
That are born in the sigh of the wind blowing by
While the dimming light brings the end to a night of lovingEmbed
