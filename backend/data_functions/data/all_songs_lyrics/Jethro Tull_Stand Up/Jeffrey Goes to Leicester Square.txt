Jeffrey Goes to Leicester Square LyricsBright city woman
Walking down Leicester Square everyday
Gonna get a piece of my mind
You think you're not a piece of my kind
Ev'rywhere the people looking
Why don't you get up and sing?
Bright city woman
Where did you learn all the things you say?
You listen to the newsmen on TV
You may fool yourself but you don't fool me
I'll see you in another place, another time
You may be someone's, but you won't be mineEmbed
