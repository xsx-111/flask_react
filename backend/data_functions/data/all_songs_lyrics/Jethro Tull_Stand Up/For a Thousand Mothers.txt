For a Thousand Mothers LyricsDid you hear mother
Saying I'm wrong but I know I'm right
Did you hear father?
Calling my name into the night
Saying I'll never be what I am now
Telling me I'll never find what I've already found
It was they who were wrong
And for them here's a song
Did you hear baby
Come back and tell you the things he's seen
Did it surprise you
To be picked up at eight in a limousine?
Doing the things he's accustomed to do
Which at one time it seemed like a dream
Now it's true
And unknowing
You made it all happen this way
Did you hear mother
Saying I'm wrong but I know I'm right
Did you hear father?
Calling my name into the night
Saying I'll never be what I am now
Telling me I'll never find what I've already found
It was they who were wrong
And for them here's a songEmbed
