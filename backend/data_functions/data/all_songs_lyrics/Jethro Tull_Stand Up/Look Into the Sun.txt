Look Into the Sun LyricsTook a sad song of one sweet evening
I smiled and quickly turned away
It's not easy singing sad songs
But still the easiest way I have to say
So when you look into the sun
See all the things we haven't done
Oh was it better then to run
Than to spend the summer crying
Now summer cannot come anyway
I had waited for time to change her
The only change that came was over me
She pretended not to want love
I hope she was only fooling me
So when you look into the sun
Look for the pleasures nearly won
Or was it better then to run
Than to spend the summer singing
And summer could have come in a day
So if you hear my sad song singing
Remember who and what you nearly had
It's not easy singing sad songs
When you can sing the song to make me glad
So when you look into the sun
And see the words you could have sung:
It's not too late, only begun
We can still make summer
Yes, summer always comes anyway
So when you look into the sun
And see the words you could have sung:
It's not too late, only begun
Look into the sunEmbed
