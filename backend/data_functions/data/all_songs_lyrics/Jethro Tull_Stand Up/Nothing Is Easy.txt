Nothing Is Easy LyricsNothing is easy
Though times get you worried
My friend, it's OK
Just take your life easy
And stop all that hurrying
Be happy my way
When tension starts mounting
And you've lost count
Of the pennies you've missed
Just try hard and see why they're not worrying me
They're last on my list
Nothing's easy
Nothing is easy, you'll find
That the squeeze won't turn out so bad
Your fingers may freeze, worse things happen at sea
There's good times to be had
So if you're alone and you're down to the bone
Just give us a play
You'll smile in a while and discover
That I'll get you happy my way
Nothing's easy2Embed
