Fat Man Lyrics

Don't want to be a fat man
People would think that I was just good fun, man
Would rather be a thin man
I am so glad to go on being one, man
Too much to carry around with you
No chance of finding a woman who
Will love you in the morning and
All the nighttime too


Don't want to be a fat man
Have not the patience to ignore all that
Hate to admit to myself
I thought my problems came from being fat, man
Won't waste my time feeling sorry for him
I've seen the other side through being thin
Roll us both down a mountain and I'm sure
The fat man would win
