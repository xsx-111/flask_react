Why This? LyricsHow thick is a surface?
Now, now, now
Now, now, now
Now, now
"Why this and not that?"
The only question you should ask
Or maybe, "What is the deepest human longing?"
I've said it before and I'll say it again
I'm complex and intellectual
But I will say, it is â€” to be loved
"Why this and not that? Why this?"
The only question you should ask, or maybe
"Why this longing to make everybody cry?"
I want us all to cry together
Why that, why that? (Why?)
And what is that sound that is haunting my throat?1Embed
