Do My Thang Lyrics
Every single night and every single day
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me, I'ma be okay
I'ma do my thang, 'cause I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my
I'ma do my thang
I'ma do my thang
I'ma do my thang

Bang bang
I'ma shoot 'em down, baby
Look at me
I'm, I'm high up off the ground, baby
Oh, shit
Pass that shit around, baby
That shit true
But, but I don't hear a sound

I'm a S-Southern belle
Crazier than hell
Gettin' wild up in here, gettin' live up in here
Burnin' up, up in here
Turnt up, up in here
We tear the roof up, now we up outta here
We do it, we do it
We don't give a fuck
Only thing we think about is turnin' up, turnin' up
We do it, we do it
We do it all the way live
So everybody hands to the sky, 'cause

Every single night and every single day
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me, I'ma be okay
'Cause I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my
I'ma do my thang
I'ma do my thang (Ay, ay, ooh)
I'ma do my thang (Oh)

Bang, bitch!
You think I'm strange, bitch?
I-It's bananas, like a fuckin' 'rangutan, bitch
Don't worry 'bout me
I got it all arranged, bitch
Mind your business
Stay in your lane, bitch
Oh, yeah
I'm a Southern belle
I told ya'll once before, I get crazier than hell
Get wild up in here, get live up in here
Turnt up, up in here
Burnin' up, up in here (here)

We do it, we do it
We don't give a fuck
Only thing we think about is turnin' up, turnin' up
We do it, we do it
We do it all the way live
So everybody hands to the sky, 'cause

Every single night and every single day
I'ma do my thang, I'ma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me, I'ma be okay
I'ma do my thang, 'cause I'ma do my thang
And I, I'ma-I'ma-I'ma do my, I'ma do my thang64Embed
