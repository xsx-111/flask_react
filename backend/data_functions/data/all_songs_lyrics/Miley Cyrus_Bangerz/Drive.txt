Drive Lyrics
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home
Without your love, without it

You told me that you wanted this
I told you it was all yours
If you're done with it, then what'd you say forever for?
If forever's out the door
I'll ignore when you call

Drive my heart into the night, yeah
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home
Without your love, without it

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

You told me you were coming back, right back
You promised it was real, and I believed that
But if I fall for it again, I will be a fool
If our love is at the end, then why do I still want you? Yeah
But I guess I got no valentine
Send me roses, I'll just let 'em die
I was crazy thinkin' you were mine
It was all just a lie
Drive my heart into the night
You could drop the keys off in the morning
'Cause I don't wanna leave home (Leave home)
Without your love, without it

Oh (Ayy)
Oh
I always knew I never wanted this
I never thought it could happen (Never thought it could happen)
You acted like you wanted this
But then you led me on (Led me on)
I thought you would be there when I go (I go)
You promised you would be there when I go (I go)
But all the broken promises, I won't miss, I'm finished
All I know are the facts
That when I look you in the eyes, all I see are the lies
Been there, done that

Drive my heart into the night (Night, yeah-yeah)
You could drop the keys off in the morning (In the morning)
'Cause I don't wanna leave home (Home)
Without your love, without it, yeah-yeah, uh42Embed
