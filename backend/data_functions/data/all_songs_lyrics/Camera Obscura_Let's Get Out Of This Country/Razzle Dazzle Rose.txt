Razzle Dazzle Rose LyricsRose, I'm feeling older
I was lucky like a four-leaved clover
Tried to be happy, but it wasn't easy
When I choose my color, it will
Be "Razzle Dazzle Rose"
Rose, I'm feeling older
Courage, my love, will make me bolder
Expecting softness can lead to foolishness
When I choose my color, it will
Be "Razzle Dazzle Rose"
Be "Razzle Dazzle Rose"Embed
