I Need All the Friends I Can Get Lyrics
I can see that you are leading her on
I think I know what you are
I can see that you are leading her on
Yeah, I know what you are

You can't see that you're just the same
As all the stupid people who you hate
I'm not saying I'm free from blame
Because I need all the friends I can get

A long distance call to a mystery blond
It wasn't good for business
You say that she cried when she heard the bird's song
You want to soothe her distress

You can't see that she's just the same
As all the stupid people who you hate
I'm not saying I'm free from blame
Because I need all the friends I can get

Can't you see that you are leading her on?
You're feeling listless
People are tired and commitment has gone
To this, I've been a witness
You can't see that I'm just the same
As all the stupid people who you hate
I'm not saying I'm free from blame
Because I need all the friends I can get

I need all the friends I can get
I need all the friends I can get
I need all the friends I can get
I need all the friends I can get
I need all the friends I can get
I need all the friends I can getEmbed
