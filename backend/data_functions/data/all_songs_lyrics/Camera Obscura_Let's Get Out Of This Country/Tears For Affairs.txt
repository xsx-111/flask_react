Tears For Affairs Lyrics
Shedding tears for affairs
I'm a funny little thing
Well, I can tell you this for nothing
Affairs don't win

Can you handle one more dirty secret, one dirty night?
Is it true what they say?
Will it make us go blind?

You had to drive
Look me in the eye
You whisper "don't cry"

I'll take an interest in illustration
It should be a laugh
But your words are with me still
They whisper in the grass

Shedding tears for affairs
I'm a stupid little thing
Well, I can tell you this for nothing
You won't win
You had to drive
(I didn't want to)
Look me in the eye
(I found it hard to)
Whisper "don't cry"
(I had to whisper "goodbye")
You had to drive
(I didn't want to)
Look me in the eye
(I found it hard to)
Whisper "don't cry"
(I had to whisper "goodbye")
You had to drive
(I didn't want to)
Look me in the eye
(I found it hard to)
Whisper "don't cry"
(I had to whisper)
So I criedEmbed
