If Looks Could Kill Lyrics
Tell me where it all went wrong
Tell me where it all went wrong

Tell me where it all went wrong
Maybe I can make it better
Tell me where it all went wrong
'Cause you know that you really upset her

When you act like a man who is cross
With every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill, then you
Will be the first to make me mad
Then you gotta go
Maybe you gotta go

Is this the kind of fate you could contemplate?
A breakdown at my very sight
Well, I promise hidden words of tenderness
In every single line that I write

Still, you act like a man who is cross
With every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill, then you
Will be the first to make me mad
Then you gotta go
Maybe you gotta go
Tell me where it all went wrong
(Tell me where it all went wrong
Maybe I could make it better)
Tell me where it all went wrong
(Tell me where it all went wrong
Maybe I could make it better)
Tell me where it all went wrong
(Tell me where it all went wrong
Maybe I could make it better)
Tell me where it all went wrong
(Tell me where it all went wrong
Maybe I could make it better)

'Cause you act like a man who is cross
With every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill, then you
Will be the first to make me mad
'Cause you act like a man who is cross
With every woman he's never had
If it's true looks could kill, then you
Will be the first to make me mad
Then you gotta go
Maybe you gotta go
If it's true looks can kill
If it's true looks can kill
Is it true looks can kill?
Yeah, it's true looks can killEmbed
