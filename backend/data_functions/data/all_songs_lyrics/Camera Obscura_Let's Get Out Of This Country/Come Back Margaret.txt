Come Back Margaret Lyrics
Come back, Margaret, he wants to adore you
Come back, Margaret, I'd like to explore you
Can't you see the tears in my eyes?
With the love for him I disguise

I like the free days with no expectations
I like it my way with no limitation
Still, you see the tears in my eyes
With the love for him I despise

Darling, you will always be around
Whether my mood's up or if it's down
In dreams, I try to take you far away
But you never stay
No, you never stay
No, you never stay
Darling, you will always be around
Whether my mood's up or if it's down
In dreams, I try to take you far away
But you never stay
No, you never stay
No, you never stay
Darling, you will always be around
Whether my mood's up or if it's down
In dreams, I try to take you far away
Oh, you never stay
No, you never stay
No, you never stayEmbed
