The False Contender Lyrics
I once had a love, but soon had enough
'Cause he was a false contender
He was so thin, there must have been
Deep sorrow gnawing away at him

What will I do?
Will it always be you?
I hope and I pray
He'll leave me one day

We were so sweet under the Copper Beach
You left your mark, you sunk your teeth
To the back of my neck, oh, letâ€™s not pretend
I needed the lesson that you taught me well

What will I do?
Will it always be you?
I hope and I pray
He'll leave me one day
What will I do?
Will it always be you?
I hope and I pray
You'll leave me one day
What will I do?
Must it always be you?
I hope and I pray
He'll leave me one day
(He'll leave me one day
He'll leave me one day
He'll leave me one day)Embed
