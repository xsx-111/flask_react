Dory Previn Lyrics
Fed up of girls in pretty dresses
With boys who want to teach them a lesson
Sick of the sight of my old lover
Went under sheets and covers
To get away from him

He can't see what it once meant to me
So, I think it's time I put him out of my mind

So I took a glimpse of Montana
Now nothing else matters
I'll heal eventually
How I adore you, Dory Previn
I turn you up to eleven
For the band's ears to bleed

I can't see what he once meant to me
Do you think it's time I put him out of my mind?
Do you think it's time I put him out of my mind?
I can't see what he once meant to me
Do I think it's time I put him out of my mind?
I can't see what he once meant to me
So, I think it's time I put him out of my mind
Yeah, I think it's time I put him out of my mind
I think it's time I let my love for him dieEmbed
