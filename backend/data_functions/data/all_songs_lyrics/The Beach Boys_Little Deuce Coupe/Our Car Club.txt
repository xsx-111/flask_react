Our Car Club Lyrics
I've been cruising 'round the town, now
With the guys for quite a while
Oh, we been thinking about starting up a club
That shows some class and style
And we'll get the finest cars

We got a Deuce Coupe
A Stingray, a rail job and an X K E
(We'll start a car club)
We'll be the fastest at the drags
Man, we'll really cut some low ETs
(We'll start a car club)
And wipe out the other clubs

We'll set a meeting and get a sponsor and collect some dues
And you can bet that we'll have our jackets on wherever we cruise

We'll get the roughest and the toughest
Initiation we can find
(We'll start a car club)
And if you want to try to get in
We'll really put you through the grind
(We'll start a car club)
This club's the very best
We'll set a meeting and get a sponsor and collect some dues
And you can bet that we'll have our jackets on wherever we cruise

We'll get the roughest and the toughest
Initiation we can find
(We'll start a car club)
And if you want to try to get in
We'll really put you through the grind
(We'll start a car club)
This club's the very best

Car club, car club
(Start a car club)
Car club, car club
(Start a car club)
Car club, car club
(Start a car club)Embed
