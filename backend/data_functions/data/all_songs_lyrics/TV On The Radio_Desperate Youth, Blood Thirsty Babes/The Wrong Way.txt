The Wrong Way LyricsWoke up in a magic nigga movie
With the bright lights pointed at me
As a metaphor
Teachin' folks the score
About patience, understanding, agape babe
And sweet sweet amour
When I realized where I was
Did I stand up and testify
Oh, fist up signify
Or did I show off my soft shoe
Maybe teach 'em a boogaloo
Busy playing the whore
Oh loiterers united
Indivisible by shame
Hungry for those diamonds
Served on little severed bloody brown hands
Oh the bling drips
Oh the bling drips down
Fallin' down just like rain
I don't want to cast pearls to swine
I don't want to march peacefully
No no no no no no no no no
New negro politician
Is stirring
Is stirring
Is stirring inside me
No there's nothing inside me
But an angry heart beat
Can you feel this heart beat?
Oh fear we're fallin' off
Oh terror we're pained
Oh hunger we're stavin' off
Roasted vermin sustain...
This shit will have to sustain
Shootin' doves from off balconies
They wanna shackle the lame
By now you know their game
Little Nina arose
Went to stand by her payphone
Waited for her caller to ring, said
Ask me anything
I just asked for Her
I just asked for her say so
And with permission
I'm gonna take liberty
And I'm tellin' you to take it too
Cause it's right there in front of you
Hey, desperate youth!
Oh, blood thirsty babes!
Oh your guns are pointed
Your guns are pointed the wrong way
Your guns are pointed the wrong way1Embed
