Staring at the Sun LyricsCross the street from your
Storefront cemetery
Hear me hailing from inside
And realize - I'm--
I am the conscience clear
In pain or ecstasy
We are all weaned, my dear
Upon the same fatigue
You're staring at the sun
(Oh, my own voice cannot save me now)
Standing in the sea
(One more breath and then I'll go down)
Your mouth is open wide, the lover is inside
And all the tumult's done, collided with the sun
You're staring at the sun, you're standing in the sea
Your body's over me
Note the trees because the
Dirt is temporary
More to mine than fact, face
Name, and monetary
Beat the skins and let the
Loose lips kiss you clean
Quietly pour out like light
Like light, like answering (the sun)
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide (the sun)
You're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck (the sun)
There's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me (the sun)
You're staring at the sun (Be what you will)
You're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide (And then throw down your life)
You're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck (Oh, it's a damned fine game)
There's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me (And we can play all night)
You're staring at the sun, you're standing in the sea
Your mouth is open wide, you're trying hard to breathe
The water's at your neck, there's lightning in your teeth
Your body's over me
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea
You're staring at the sun
You're standing in the sea6Embed
