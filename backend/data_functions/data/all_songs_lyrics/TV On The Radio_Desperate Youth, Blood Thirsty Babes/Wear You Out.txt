Wear You Out Lyrics
I can barely move
For want of room
And I'm forgetting to breathe
But the sight of you
Has me instantly
Remember my needs

Oh the lights spin
And the beat breaks in
And I'm smelling your sweet
Should I spend the next six hours
Trying to get you
Off your feet?

Oh no girl, just pretend
There is no one else around
So let's break it down
Ooh, let's break it down

Watch a room full of roosters
Turned to cocks running wild
Scrambling like hungry dogs
Towards you, child
See those boys trying to sweat you
Watching grown men cry

Like you're shaking it

Put something in their eyes
Oh wide open eyes
Well here I am
Just a man
Is this light flattering?
Did you notice my crown of feathers
And check out my vital vibrant comb?
Oh puff chest out and play strong
Grab you by the hair and pull you along

Or do I just talk to you
And tell you what I really
Really really want to do
Stop because you think that you
Know where this is going
Couldn't stop it girl
If you knew where this was going
You don't know the half
You seem so so smart
Ooh, but you're so wrong
Closing time
Pale blue lights gonna shine
In through any open window
Nighttime says goodbye

Let's pursue this argument in darkness
Curtains drawn, limbs entwined
Now you're two hours away
From starting your day
And you can't be late
So let's get straight

Let me wear you out
Let me make you mine, mine, mineEmbed
