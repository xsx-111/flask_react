Dreams LyricsAll your dreams are over now
And all your wings have fallen down
Oh all your dreams are over now
And all your wings have fallen down
She's just like you
So why keep doing what you do
Why cut a friend
Why cruise that mean lean to an end
You could have heel-toed
To another place
You could have peeled slow
To a better place
But your heart can't grieve
(All your dreams are over now)
For your little dreams
(And all your wings have fallen down)
Oh no your heart can't grieve
(All your dreams are over now)
Not for your little dreams
(And all your wings have fallen down)
Broke trust in two
Now no one's looking out for you
Why keep it cruel
Why waste so much to play the fool
And maybe I'm a fool but I think we'd find
That we could all be so so kind
If you'd just leave your treadmill power trip behind
Oh leave your treadmill power trip behind
And maybe it's best that you're so so blind
It's best that youâ€™re so so blind
Because your heart can't grieve
I know your heart can't grieve
I know your heart can't grieve
What your eyes won't see
But you were my favorite moment
Of our dead century
I know your heart can't grieve
What your eyes won't see
But you were my favorite moment
Of our dead century
But all your dreams are over now
And all your wings have fallen down
Oh all your dreams are over now
All your wings have fallen down
Oh warfarin' terrapin
Unconfined undesigned
(All your dreams are over now)
Undersigned bantering
Bartering bellowing
Barracking blundering
(And all your wings have fallen down)
Pillaging plundering
Living and lavishing
Hammerings harrowing
(All your dreams are over now)
Flourishing flattening
Levelling reveling
Wrecking and ravaging
Savoring savaging
(And all your wings have fallen down)
Oh warfarin' terrapin
Unconfined undesigned
You've got me worried and wondering
(All your dreams are over now)
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering
(And all your wings have fallen down)
Worried and wondering
Worried and wondering
All your dreams are over now
All your wings have fallen down
All your dreams are over now1Embed
