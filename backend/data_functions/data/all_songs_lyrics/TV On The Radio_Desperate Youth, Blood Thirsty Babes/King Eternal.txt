King Eternal Lyrics
All men condemned by men to die
Damned by blind bitch in hallowed halls
Hear it, heed this call

Oh fucking eternal

Infinity's hourglass will measure all measure all
So, power
Cover your balls
Because we swing kung fu


Afraid of thunder children, so hide your ears
Hope your fortress holds up for many many many years
Shudder, it's a shame
Lightning, call the game
Send us up a baby boy
Let the smoke carry his name
If it's a girl let her shine
We will be


The hour of man is nigh
So gather up all supplies
And stack them up high
Stack them up high

Faith, Nathan I could see it in your eyes
Warmth, Nathan I can see it in your eyes
Golden houses, silver brides
Immortal erection, tongues untied

Oh fuckingEmbed
