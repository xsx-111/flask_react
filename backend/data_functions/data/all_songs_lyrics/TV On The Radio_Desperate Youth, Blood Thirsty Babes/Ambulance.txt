Ambulance Lyrics
Your slim frame
Your eager eyes, and your wild mane
Oh, they keep me where I belong
All wrapped up in wrong
You're to blame
For wasted words of sad refrain
Oh, let them take me where they may
Believe me when I say, oh

I will be your accident
If you will be my ambulance
And I will be your screech and crash
If you will be my crutch and cast
And I will be your one more time
If you will be my one last chance
Oh, fall for me

Your slim frame
Oh, your simple stare and your wrong, wrong name
Oh, they keep me where I belong
All strung out in song
Why so tame?
When we could shoot wilder vines through younger veins
Sip slow from night's deep wells
And watch our garden swell
Once the seeds are sown
Wild and overgrown
You'll see
Hearts colors change like leaves (like leaves)

Oh, sweet, sweet dream fall for me
Fall fast, fall free, fall for me
Because...

I will be your ambulance
If you will be my accident
And I will be your screech and crash
If you will be my crutch and cast
And I will be your one more time
If you will be my one last chance
Oh, sweet dream fall with me
Fall fast, fall free, fall with me2Embed
