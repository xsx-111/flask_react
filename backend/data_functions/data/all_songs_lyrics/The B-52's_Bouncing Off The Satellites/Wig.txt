Wig LyricsWhat's that on your head?
A wig
Wig. Wig. Wig
Sally's gotta wig
Ricky's gotta wig
Baby's gotta wig
Kate's gotta wig
Fred's gotta cheap toupee
Keith's gotta big bouffant on
We all got wigs, so... Let's go!
On the neon, neon side of town
On the neon, neon side of town
Julia's gotta wig
Phyllis has a wig
Cindy's gotta wig
J.T's gotta wig
Carol's fall fell
Bubba's gotta big bouffant on
We all got wigs, so... Let's go!
On the neon, neon side of town
On the neon, neon side of town
(Wigtalk)
On the neon, neon side of town
On the neon, neon side of town
What's that on you head?
A wig
Wig. Wig. Wig
Wigs on fire! Wigs on fire! Wigs on... Fire!
It's 2525 and we've got the most wigs alive!
Wigs on fire! Wigs on fire! Take it... Higher!
It's 2525 and we've got the hottest dos alive!
