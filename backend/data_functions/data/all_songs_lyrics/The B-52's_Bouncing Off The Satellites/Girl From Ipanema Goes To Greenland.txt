Girl From Ipanema Goes To Greenland Lyrics
Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland
Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland

Witch-doctors are screaming
Nymphs are dreaming
This girl's lost someone
Who is that someone
She's leaving

Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland
Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland

Hot latitudes, cool atitudes
She's leaving
Moon in her mirror
Chasing northern lights
She goes
Ahhh

Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland
Remember wherever you go
There you are

Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland
Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland
Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland
Girl from Ipanema goes to Greenland1Embed
