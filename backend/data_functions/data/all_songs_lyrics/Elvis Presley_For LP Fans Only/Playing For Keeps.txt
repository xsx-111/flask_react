Playing For Keeps Lyrics
I'm playing for keeps
This time it's real
And I want you to know
Exactly how I feel
I'm playing for keeps
For sure this time
And I won't be happy
Until I know you're mine

There have been others
That could love me true
But no one else
Can thrill me like you do
I'm playing for keeps
Oh, love me too
Oh, don't make me sorry
That I fell in love with you

There have been others
That could love me true
But no one else
Can thrill me like you do
I'm playing for keeps
Oh, love me too
Oh, don't make me sorry
That I fell in love with you (in love with you)Embed
