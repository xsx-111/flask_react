My Baby Left Me Lyrics
Yes my baby left me
Never said a word
Was it something I done
Something that she heard?

My baby left me
My baby left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word

Now I stand at my window
Wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman
Hate to say goodbye

You know she left me
Yes, she left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word
Baby, one of these mornings
Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and
Baby, and daddy he'll be gone
