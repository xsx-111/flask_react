Poor Boy Lyrics
They call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
But I ain't lonesome and I ain't blue
'Cause I could never be a poor boy
As long as I've got a dolly like you

Ain't got a crust, ain't got a cent
Can't buy a jug, can't pay the rent
I got a heart full of dreams and a lot of memories
And that's enough for me

They call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
But I ain't lonesome and I ain't blue
'Cause I could never be a poor boy
As long as I've got a dolly like you

Can't buy a house, can't buy a lot
Ain't got a bean, ain't got a pot
But what I got is a heart full of love and memories
And that's enough for me

They call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
But I ain't lonesome and I ain't blue
I've got a dolly like you
As long as I've got a dolly like you
Don't have a pig, don't have a cow
I don't have a horse to pull a plow
But what I got is a heart full of love and memories
And that's enough for me

They call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy
But I ain't lonesome and I ain't blue
'Cause I could never be a poor boy
I've got a dolly like
I've got a dolly like
I've got a dolly like youEmbed
