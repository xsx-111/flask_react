Mystery Train Lyrics
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train got my baby and gone

Train train, coming 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, coming 'round the bend
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again
No, not again

Train train, coming down the line
Train train, coming down the line
Well, it's bringing my baby, because she's mine all, all mine
She's mine, all, all mine

Train train, coming 'round, 'round the bend
Train train, coming 'round, 'round the bend
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again
No, not again
