Heartland LyricsLay me down the long white line
Leave the sirens far behind me
Paint my name in black and gold
My heart, my flame, my heart, my road
My heartland fade across the line
Heartland sing the faces shining
In the failing, failing, failing
Heartland make the places mine
Clearly now the past mistakes
The giant steps we had to take
The path that ever promise made to
Die in dream dissolve and fade
My heartland, heartland, heartland 
Behind the lines a face that glimmers
Still looking for a face that shines
In the promise in the places
I'm going to make them mine
My heartland, heartland, heartland Embed
