Body Electric LyricsThrough the cables and the underground now
The faceless breathless calls
This is babel, sensurround now
This place is death with walls
Too much contact, no more feeling
The sound around them all
Acid on the floor so she walk on the ceiling
And the body electric flashes on the bathroom wall
And the body electric flashes on the bathroom wall
Crawling to the corners where the idiot children call
See the body flashing on the bathroom wall6Embed
