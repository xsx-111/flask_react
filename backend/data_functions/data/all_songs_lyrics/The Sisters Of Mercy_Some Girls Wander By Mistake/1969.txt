1969 LyricsWell all right!!!
Well it's 1969 ok
We got a war across the USA
There's nothing here for me and you
We're just sitting here with nothing to do
Well there's nothing here for me and you
Another year with nothing to do
Now last year I was 21
I didn't have a lot of fun
Now I'm gonna be 22
So, oh my, I'll boohoo
Now I'm gonna be 22
So, oh my, I'll boohoo
Well it's 1969 ok
We got a war across the USA
There's nothing here for me and you
We're just sitting here with nothing to do
Well it's 1969, baby
Well it's 1969, baby
Well it's 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9-teen 69
