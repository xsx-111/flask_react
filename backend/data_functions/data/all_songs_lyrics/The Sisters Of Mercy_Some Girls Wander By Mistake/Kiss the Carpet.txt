Kiss the Carpet LyricsShe got red eyes
She wear dust
I went over over over
I went bust
I kissed I kissed the carpet
I climbed the curtain
I was certain
And I said yeah
Yeah
She got red eyes
She wear dust
I went over over over
I went bust
I kissed I kissed the carpet
I climbed the curtain
I was certain
But I said
Next Time I look before I
Next time the carpet
Next time I look before I
Kiss the carpet should I
Kiss
Kiss
KissEmbed
