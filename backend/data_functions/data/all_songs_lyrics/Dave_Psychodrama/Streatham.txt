Streatham Lyrics
Look

I grew up in Streatham
Teachers was givin' man tests
Same time the mandem were givin' out testers
I got peng tings givin' man stress
I ain't gotta sex it, message or text it
I don't wanna do you and I
Like I'm in Leicester skippin' my lectures
We used to ride 'round all reckless

Stolen 'peds, that's Geely and Vespas
And the feds called my broski restless
Said he got a charge in the car, no Tesla
And everybody 'round me rowdy
I walk in, tell the jeweler, "Wow me"
If you're talkin' 'bout P's just 'low me
19, I put 19 on an Audi
I'll never forget that day that I found me the cutest caramel brownie
And the chest and back both bouncy
Trust me, everyting shake, no Saudi
My G just came out for a shooting
And Ramz done a madness, charting
Say that man got something in common
'Cause trust me, both of their tings been barking
If you see him at a drinkup, park him
Do it like Jordan, run up and spark him
My G's been on badness, way before they had a moustache like Stalin
And this ting's all love and hate, 'cause a lot of man love to hate
My young G done draws and eights
Now he's cuttin' through bricks like the 1-1-8
And I ain't on indirects, diss me, and I take that personal
How you gassed off a note that's purple?
Bet you never got it off white like Virgil
Two men and an angry Merc
That's war wit' a German, Winston Churchill
It's mad when man wanna murk you
But you know you gotta be in by curfew
And I seen a lot of man get pressured, why?
I grew up in Streatham
And teachers was givin' man tests
Same time mandem were givin' out testers
I got peng tings givin' man stress
I ain't gotta sex it, message or text it
I don't wanna do you and I
Like I'm in Leicester skippin' my lectures
We used to roll 'round all stupid

Mitcham Lane, that's Streatham and Tooting
I'm in East tryna link my girl
'Cause I've got a baby, a crossbow like Cupid
Man are dead or in jail, that's useless
Tell a yute, "If you've got a brain, then use it"
Now I drive past man I went school with
You was the cool kid, now you look clueless
And I'm still tryna tell man, "Fuck the Audi, switch it for a Benz"
When you're tryna make it out the ends
Friends of enemies are enemies
And enemies of enemies are friends
Fuck the Benz, I switch it for a Beamer
Tell the dealer, "Need a bigger litre"
He told me he's on me when he sees me
I barely remember why we're beefin'
But I grew up in Streatham
And teachers was givin' man tests
Same time mandem were givin' out testers
I've got peng tings givin' me stress
Nudes in the message, put in an effort
But I don't need a me and you
Like when a chef would eat at his restaurant23Embed
