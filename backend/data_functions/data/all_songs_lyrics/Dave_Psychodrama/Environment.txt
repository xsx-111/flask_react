Environment Lyrics
What do you think people see when they look at you?

Look
You see our gold chains and our flashy cars
I see a lack of self worth and I see battle scars
He has to be with twenty man when he wears jewelry
And you see it as gangster, I see it as insecurity
Where I'm from, everybody wants to make it out
But nobody wants to see somebody make it out
It ain't about who came around but more about who stayed around
Behind the scenes, they said God gave us eyes to see
You see the video vixens and all their pearly whites
But you don't see the dirty nights, long days and early flights
You see the deals and think all these rappers laughing now
But you don't get that if we weren't already, we're a target now
You see, all the groupie girls and think they're heaven sent
I see twenty-five minutes worth of empty sex
To tell a lie, it wasn't my intention to objectify
But I can testify, I've seen some shit you couldn't rectify
You see this industry where everybody came up
I see a bag of weird rappers and some fake love
Fake handshakes and fake spuds with fake comments
Where everybody covers costs but never pays homage
The scene turned on me, people tryna ruin me
Where most would see a problem, I'm seeing an opportunity
To drop a freestyle and kill them niggas that were booing me
I made my haters watch and put the screw inside of scrutiny
Beautifully, also, if I am attending
Security's coming first like I was trying to shop at Duty Free
Where the fuckâ€™s the unity?
Where I come from there's no class, forget truancy
We have got nowt in common
Them niggas see a molehill and make a mountain from it
They see a Cuban and a whip, I see a house deposit
How to stop it?
Niggas saw keys and went to trial for shottin'
I saw keys, learned to play, and made thousands from it
You see the club poppin' when we do the show
But you don't see the studio, my life is not a movie, bro
Champagne bottles and all the screaming girls
It's ironic how you'll never hear a scream for help
Fuckin' hell, why do you think we're going through the same thing?
Depression when you make it, the pressure and the hatred
Your people talk about you, you can't say shit
The moment that you ain't it
The labels are looking for replacements
Same shit, people start forgetting what you've done for them
Everyone in music's gonna take until there's nothing left
Your fans are switching up on you
And they don't know how tough it gets
Reading through your old comments, trying to feel some love again
I see karma
Go to work but God schemes harder
I heard success can come quickly but it leaves faster
Secrets are what my enemies have been after
Only L's I'm hiding in my closet have a V after
So looking at it from another perspective, playing devil's advocate
Considering you know you're obviously becoming famous, so to speak
But you still deal with a lot of issues on a human level
Do you ever just sit and wonder about the stories behind the people you meet day by day?
Does it make you feel grateful, in a weird way, for your life and problems?4Embed
