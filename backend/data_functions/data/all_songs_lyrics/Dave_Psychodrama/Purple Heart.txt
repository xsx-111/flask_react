Purple Heart Lyrics
Look, let's pour another drink and numb the pain
Emotionally detached, she said, "I'm numb to pain"
You're asking what it's like to love, I told her love's a game
You learn that love is pain, then learn to love the pain
I got a purple heart, you've got a purple heart
You think my work is art, and I think you're a work of art
But girl, I can't lie
You're a gem and I ain't even talking 'bout the star sign
You're my superstar, you're my wishing to a shooting star
After hours, you're my movie star
Pop star, I've got you singing like a rock star
McCartney, she interstellar like Jupiter
You had a shift today? Cancel that
I booked a flight, let's go and catch a tan
I'll take you out to Hakkasan
You've had a couple boyfriends but never had a man
I'll catch him at a traffic jam
Red Light, Amsterdam, if he tries to disrespect
But fuck them, man, let's blow a bag on Chanel and get all them niggas vexed
On some different flow, acting like you didn't know
A nigga so Gary Coleman, I got them different strokes
You throw it back and now I'm matching your rhythm in missionary
I'm a man on a mission to make your legs shake
To make you feel it in your stomach and your chest plate
Until the next day you give me head until your head aches
I heard a saying, you get it fast, it never lasts
Forget pain, there's no club inside of a deck of cards
You gave your heart to a joker, now you can try a king
You play it close to the chest, you've got a checkered past
And a purple heart, wow, you've got a purple heart
You think my work is art and I think you're a work of art
Asked her, "Can you do it like the last time?"
She said, "I can, sir, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the star sign"
I guess it's important that you have someone you can trust
Especially in the position you're in, and um...
I think it's a really good trait that you're able to find positives
Despite some of the challenges, for want of a better word, that you face4Embed
