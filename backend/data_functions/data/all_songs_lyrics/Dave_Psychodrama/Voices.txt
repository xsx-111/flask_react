Voices Lyrics
I gotta speak out
I know heartbreak well, man, I got her on speed dial
Me and suffering got the same dad
Me and pain go way back
And it's hard to explain but

Oh, my love, I hear voices
Oh, my love, I hear voices when I sleep
Oh, my love, I hear voices
And the voices
They say you’re everything that I need

I can't get 'em out
I can't get 'em out my head
I can't get 'em out

Look, I don't wanna waste time
But heartache's my G I can get her on FaceTime (Right now)
Mother's life
I don't know envy, that nigga lives on the other side
But the struggle my bredrin
And the hustle my best friend
I heard of regret but I don't know him as well as my last few ex's
All this pain must be the reason
The reason that
Oh, my love, I hear voices
Oh, my love, I hear voices when I sleep
Oh, my love, I hear voices
And the voices
They say you’re everything that I need

I can't get 'em out
I can't get 'em out my head
I can't get 'em out

Used to sit down in a room all day and think to myself, "What the fuck am I doing wrong?"
Sorrow's a bitch, I'm glad that she left, I'm moving on
Never had no pot to piss in
Made so many wrong decisions
'Til I fell in love with optimism
And our love, it's like the sweetest thing
Man grew up 'round sweets and cling
Now we pull up to the club with the sweetest tings
I can’t even play with the ting if she ain't 19 on a FIFA ting
I don’t care what beef mans in, can't pull up 'round here on a idiot ting 'cause-

Oh, my love, I hear voices
Oh, my love, I hear voices when I sleep
Oh, my love, I hear voices
And the voices
They say you’re everything that I need
I can't get 'em out
I can't get 'em out my head
I can't get 'em out2Embed
