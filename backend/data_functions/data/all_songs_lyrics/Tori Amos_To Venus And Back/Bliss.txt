Bliss Lyrics
Father, I killed my monkey
I let it out to taste the sweet of spring
Wonder if I will wander out
Test my tether to see if I’m still free
From you

Steady as it comes right down to you
I’ve said it all
So maybe we’re a bliss of another kind
I said, a bliss of another kind, I said

Lately, I’m into circuitry
What it means to be made of you but not enough for you
And I wonder if you can bilocate
Is that what I taste, your supernova juice?
You know it’s true, I’m part of you

Steady as it comes right down to you
I’ve said it all
So maybe we’re a bliss of another kind, I said
Steady as it comes right down to you
I’ve said it all
So maybe you’re a 4 horse engine
With a power drive, I said
A hot kachina who wants into mine, I said
Take it, take it with your terra-terracide and I said

Steady as it comes right down to you
I’ve said it all
So maybe we’re a bliss of another kind
I said, a bliss of another kind
I said, a bliss of another kind

I said, a bliss of, a bliss of
A bliss of another kind1Embed
