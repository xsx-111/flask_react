The Waitress (Live)  Lyrics
I want to kill this waitress
She’s worked here a year longer than I
If I did it fast you know, that’s an act of kindness

But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe, I believe in peace
I said I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in, I believe in peace
I said

I want to kill this waitress, you know?
There’re too many stars and not enough sky
I can't believe there's violence in my mind

But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe, oh, I believe in peace
I said, I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe, oh, I believe in peace
I said

Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna go where she goes
Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna get me get me one of those
Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna go where she goes
Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna get me, get me, yeah
Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna go where she goes
Hang ten
'Cause I know just where she is
I said
Hang ten
'Cause I know just where she is going
Hang ten
'Cause I know just where she is
I said
Hang, hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna go where she goes
Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna get me, get me
Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna go where she goes
Hang ten
'Cause I know just where she is
I said
Hang, hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna go where she goes
Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna get me, get me
Hang ten, hang ten, honey
I'm gonna go where she goes
Hang ten
'Cause I know just where she is
Because I believe in peace, yes
I believe in peace, I said
I believe, I said
You know what I believe in
I believe in peace, I said
I believe in peace
But I believe that she's the Devil bitch

I believe in her something
I believe in her something
I believe in that girl
I believe in her goodness
I believe in her darkness
But I believe that she's the Devil bitch

I believe in her something
I believe in her something
I believe in that girl
I believe in her goodness
I believe in her darkness
I know she can kill me

I believe in something
I believe in something
I believe in that girl
I believe in her goodness
I believe in your darkness
But I believe
I said I know, I know what I believe
I believe in something
I believe in something
I believe in that girl
I believe in your goodness
I believe in your darkness
But I believe that she's the Devil bitch

Wait...
