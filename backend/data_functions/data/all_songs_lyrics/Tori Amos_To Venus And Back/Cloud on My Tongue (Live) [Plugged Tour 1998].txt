Cloud on My Tongue (Live)  Lyrics
Hey, hey

Someone's knocking on my kitchen door
Leave the wood outside, well
All the girls here are freezing cold
Leave me with your Borneo
I said, "I don't need much to keep me warm"

Don't stop now what you're doing
What you're doing, my ugly one
Bring them all here
How do you hide a
Hundred girls in your hair?
It won't be fair if I hate her, if I ate her
You can go now, you can go now

You're already in here
I'll be wearing your tattoo
You're already in there

Got a cloud sleeping on my tongue
He goes, then it goes and
Kiss the violets as they're waking up
Leave me with your Borneo
I said,  "Leave me the way I was before"
You're already in there
I'll be wearing your tattoo, yes
I'm already in

Circles and circles, circles again, the girls
Circles and, circles again, the girls
Circles and, circles again, the girls
Circles and circles and circles again, well

Got one knocking on my kitchen door
Leave the wood outside, well
All the girls here are freezing cold
You can go now, you can go now
You can go now, you can go now

You're already in there
I'll be wearing your tattoo
I'm already in

Circles and circles, circles again, the girls
Circles and got to stop spinning
Circles and circles again, the girls
I said I've got to stop spinning
Circles and circles again
Circles and got to stop spinning
Circles and circles again, well
Thought I was over the bridge now
Thought I was over the bridge now
Me and you and he and IEmbed
