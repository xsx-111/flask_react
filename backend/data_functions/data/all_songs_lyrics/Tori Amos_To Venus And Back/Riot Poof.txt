Riot Poof Lyrics
Break the terror, break the terror
Break the terror of the urban spell

You know what you know
So you go break the terror of the urban spell
This alliance you say, "I'm on the threshold of greatness, girl"
So you burn your pagoda through the Congo
Till there's a broken bond
On the birth of the search white trash, my native son

It will all find its way, its way in time
It will all find its way, its way in time
Blossom
Riot Poof

You know what you know
So you go and chain her to your flow
She bites through your dry lean meat
As she's going to the movie show
In a bath of glitter and a tiny shiver
She crawls through your java sea
Black Sahara I'm stepping into your space oddity
It will all find its way, its way in time
It will all find its way, its way in time
Blossom
Riot Poof
Blossom
Riot Poof

The sun is warming, my man is moistening
I said the sun is warming, my man is moistening
I said the sun is warming, my man is moistening
(On the bomb, on the bond, on the bomb, on the bond)
I said the sun is warming, my man is, the sun is
(On the bomb, on the bond, on the bomb, on the bond)
The sun is warming, my man is moistening
(On the bomb, on the bond, on the bomb, on the bond)
I said the sun is warming, my man is moistening
(On the bomb, on the bond, on the bomb, on the bond)
The sun is warming, my man is moistening
(On the bomb, on the bond, on the bomb, on the bond)
I said the sun is warming, my man is moistening
(On the bomb, on the bond, on the bomb, on the bond)
(On, on, ond)Embed
