Little Earthquakes (Live)  Lyrics
Yellow bird flying
Gets shot in the wing
Good year for hunters
And Christmas parties
And I hate, and I hate
And I hate, and I hate
Elevator music
The way we fight
The way I'm left here silent

Oh, these little earthquakes
Here we go again
Oh, these little earthquakes
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces

We danced in graveyards
With vampires till dawn
We laughed in the faces of kings
Never afraid to burn
And I hate, and I hate
And I hate, and I hate
Disintegration
Watching us wither
Black winged roses that safely changed their color
Oh, these little earthquakes
Here we go again
Oh, these little earthquakes
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces

I can't reach you
I'm not inside your head
I can't reach you
Shut away just like you are
I can't reach you
You're so sure of what you know
I can't reach you, can't reach you

Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me my, give me myself, ah honey
Give me life, give me pain
Give me my, give me myself
Give me life, give me pain
Give me myself again
Give me life, give me pain
Give me my, give me myself honey
Give me li-

Oh, these little earthquakes
Here we go again
Oh, these little earthquakes
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
Doesn't take much to rip us into pieces
HereEmbed
