Lust Lyrics
Hey you, gender nectar
Sifting through the grain of gold
Tripping at your door
Is that you? Alpha in her blood
And when the woman lies
You don’t believe her

Rolling and unrolling
Coiling, emerging
Running free, running through
The underworld into your room

Is he real or a ghost-lie?
She feels she isn’t heard
And the veil tears and rages
Till her voices are remembered
And his secrets can be told

Remember, remember
Remember, remember
Remember, remember
Remember, remember
Hey you, gender nectar
Crystalline from the vine
You know you’ll drink her

Rolling and unrolling
Coiling, emerging
Running free, running through
The underworld into your room

So she prays for a prankster
And lust in the marriage bed
And he waits till she can give
And he waits and he waitsEmbed
