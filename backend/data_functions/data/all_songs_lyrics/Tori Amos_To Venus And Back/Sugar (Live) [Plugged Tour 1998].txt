Sugar (Live)  Lyrics
Don't say morning's come
Don't say it's up to me
If I could take twenty five minutes
Out of the record books

Sugar, bring me sugar

Bobby's collecting bees
And hammers, he used one on me
Cold war with little boys
Get in with a bubble gum trade and

Sugar, bring me sugar
Well, I know the robins bring
Bring me many things but
Sugar, just bring me sugar
As far as I can tell
I've been gone for miles now

And you know and I know
I don't know me very well
And I know and you know
If they found me out
Just honey, you just, you just watch what they do
Sweet boy when they find you out
Tell me what you think they'll do
Pretty thing, you gonna leave?
Tell me what you think they'll do
When they find you out
When they find you out
Find out, you're just a pussy
My sweet boy

My sugar, hey, sugar
I know the robins bring
Bring me many things but
Sugar, bring me sugar, yes
I know the robins bring
They bring many things
My sugar, bring me sugar

What they did it to you
Oh my God, my sweet boy
Hey, hey, you
Me? I make to the sky
Hey, hey, sweet
Just not enough, just not enough yeah
Hey, so sweet now, not, not enough now, yes
Hey, hey, IEmbed
