Space Dog (Live)  Lyrics
Way to go, Mr. Microphone
Show us all what you don’t know
Centuries, secret societies
He’s our commander still, Space Dog

So sure we were on something
"Your feet are finally on the ground," he said
So sure we were on something
"Your feet are just on the ground, girl"


Rain and snow, our engines have
Been receiving your eager call
There’s Colonel Dirtyfishydishcloth
He’ll distract her good, don’t worry so

And to the one you thought was on your side
She can’t understand, she truly believes the lie

Lemon pie, he’s coming through
Our commander still, Space Dog
Lines secure, Space Dog
Deck the halls I’m young again, I’m you again
Racing turtles, the grapefruit is winning
Seems I keep getting this story
Twisted so where’s Neil when you need him
Deck the halls it’s you again, it’s you again
Somewhere someone most know the ending
Is she still pissing in the river, now?
Heard she’d gone, moved into a trailer park

So sure we were on something
"Your feet are finally, finally..."
So sure we were on something
"Your feet are finally, finally..."
I said

So sure we were, we were on something I said
"Your feet are finally on..."
So sure we were on something
"Your feet are just on the ground"Embed
