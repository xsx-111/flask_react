Cruel (Live)  Lyrics
So don’t give me respect
Don’t give me a piece of your preciousness
Flaunt all she’s got in our old neighborhood
I’m sure she’ll make a few friends
Even the rainbows down let us pray
As you cock-cock-cock your mane
No cigarettes, only peeled Havanas for you

I can be cruel
I don’t know why
Why can’t my balloon stay up
In a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel
I don’t know why
I don’t know why

Dance with the Sufis
Celebrate your top ten in the charts of pain
Lover brother Bougainvillea
My vine twists around your need
Even the rain is sharp like today
As you sh-sh-shock me sane
No cigarettes, only peeled Havanas for you
I can be cruel
I don’t know why
Why can’t my balloon stay up
In a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel
I don’t know why
I don’t know why

Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah, yes
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah, right
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah, yes
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah, right
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah, you think you own it
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, yeah, go again
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah, yes
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah, girls
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah, you're better than them
Wanna go
When you go
Again, I say, go

Deeper, deeper than you go
Deeper than you can
Deeper than you can go
Deeper than you can
I said, you can
Right in my eye
Deeper, deeper than you go
You go deeper still
Deeper, but still you go
When you said you can
I said, you can
When you try and
Tear it out and tear it out
And tear it out and you go
Deeper, deeper than you go
Deeper than you can
Deeper but still you can
Deeper than you can
I said, you can
Tear it out and tear it out
And tear it out again
Hey, and you know, you know
You're gonna lie, boy
Way here
I said here, yes
I can be cruel, darling
I don’t know why
Why can’t my balloon stay up
In a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel
I don’t know why
I don’t know why

Why, why
"Hey everybody, how's it going?"Embed
