Cooling (Live)  Lyrics
"So this little song, um, it's probably- she's one of my best friends of all the songs. And um, she just didn't wanna be on any of the records. She was, um, supposed to be on Pele, and then she told me to fuck off and then she, uh, was supposed to be on Choirgirl, sort of, kind of. And then she said, 'You know? No.' And then, uh, she decided she liked being played live so I play her a lot and, um, this is sort of my goodbye to you."

Maybe I didn’t like to hear
But I still can’t believe Speed Racer is dead
So then I thought I’d make some plans
But fire thought she’d really rather be water instead

And Peggy got a message for me from Jesus
And I've heard every word that you have said
And I know I have been driven like the snow
But this is cooling faster than I can
This is cooling faster than I

So then love walked up to like
And said, "I know that you don’t like me much, let’s go for a ride"
This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree
And is your place in heaven worth giving up these kisses?
These, yes, these kisses

And Peggy got a message for me from Jesus
And I heard every word that you have said
And I know I have been driven like the snow
But this is cooling faster than I can
This is cooling faster than I
This is cooling
This is cooling
This is cooling
This is coolingEmbed
