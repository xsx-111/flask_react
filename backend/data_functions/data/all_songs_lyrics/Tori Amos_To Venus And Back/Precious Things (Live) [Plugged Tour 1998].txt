Precious Things (Live)  Lyrics
So I ran faster
But it caught me here
Yes, my loyalties turned
Like my ankle
In the seventh grade
Running after Billy
Running after the rain

These precious things
Let them bleed
Let them wash away
These, I said, oh, precious things
Let them break
Their hold on me

I said, I got
He said, he, you
I said, I said, I said, I do

He said "you're really an ugly girl
But I like the way you play"
And I died, I died, but I thanked him
Can you believe that?
Sick, holding on to his picture
Dressing up every day
I wanna smash the faces
Of those beautiful boys
Those Christian boys
Beautiful boys
I said Christian boys
Beautiful boys
I said Christian boys
So, you can make me cum
That doesn't make you Jesus
These precious things
Let them bleed
Let them wash away
These, I said, oh, precious things
Let them break
Their hold on me

I remember, yes
In my peach party dress
No one dared
No one cared to tell me
Where the pretty girls are
Those demigods
With their nine-inch nails
And little fascist panties
Tucked inside the heart
Of every nice girl

These things, oh, yes
I said let them bleed
These in my heart, you in my heart
And I just let them just bleed now
You're in my heart, they're in my heart
Leave them, leave them
I said these, oh, no, precious things
They will bleed, yes
Watch them
These, they're my precious things
They're my bleeding, yes
Watch these things, yes, wash away
These are my precious thing
Let them bleed, now, girls
Just bleed
These are my precious thing
Let them break, break
Their hold on me
I said, I said I can't let you go
Precious, preciousEmbed
