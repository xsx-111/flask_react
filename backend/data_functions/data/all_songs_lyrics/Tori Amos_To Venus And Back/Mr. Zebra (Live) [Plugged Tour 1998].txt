Mr. Zebra (Live)  Lyrics
"Rabbits, blinkity, blinkity, blink."

Hello, Mr. Zebra
Can I have your sweater
Cause it’s cold, cold, cold
In my hole, hole, hole
Ratatouille Strychnine
Sometimes she’s a friend of mine
With a gigantic whirlpool
That will blow your mind

Hello, Mr. Zebra
Ran into some confusion
With a Mrs. Crocodile-dile-dile
Furry mussels marching on
She thinks she’s Kaiser Wilhelm
Or a civilised syllabub
To blow your mind

Figure it out, she
She’s a good-time fella
She got a little fund to fight
For Money-penny’s rights
Figure it out, she
She is a good-time fella
"Too bad the burial was premature,"
She said and smiledEmbed
