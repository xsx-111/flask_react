Glory of the 80's Lyrics
I took a taxi from LA to Venus in 1985
I was electromagnetically sucked back into a party going on that night
It was the glories of the '80s with karma drawn up in lines
And two bugle boy models saying, “Baby, it’s a freebie you sure look deprived”

I had the story of O in my bucket seat in my wannabe Mustang
Auditioning for reptiles in their Raquel Welsh campaign
"In the glories of the '80s," you said, “I’m not afraid to die”, I said
"I don’t find that remotely funny even on the space cake high"

And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and disappear (Disappear)
Disappear

Silicone party barbies to the left and Joan of Arcs to the right
No one feeling insecure we were all gorge and famous in our last lives
In the glories of the '80s you said, “The end is nothing to fear”
I said, "Blow the end now baby, who do I gotta shag to get outta here?"

And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and disappear (Disappear)
Disappear (Disappear)
Sure you’re out there orbiting around
Sure you’re out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back now
Sure you’re out there orbiting around
Sure you’re out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back now

I met a drag king called Venus she had a velvet hologram she said
“My husband ran off with my shaman but they love me as I am”
In the glories of the '80s I may not have to die
I’ll clone myself Like that blonde chick that sings Bette Davis Eyes

And then when it all seemed clear
Just then you go and

Sure you’re out there orbiting around
Sure you’re out there orbiting around
Wish I had you back now

And then when it all seems clear
Just then you go and
Disappear (Disappear)
Disappear (Disappear)
I took a taxi from LA to Venus in 1980...
