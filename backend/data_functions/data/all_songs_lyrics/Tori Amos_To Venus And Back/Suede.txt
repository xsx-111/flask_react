Suede

Suede, you always felt like suede
There are days I feel your twin
Peekaboo, hiding underneath your skin
Jets are revving, yes, revving from a central source
And this has power over me
Not because you feel something
Or don’t feel something for me but because
Mass so big it can swallow, swallow her whole star intact

Call me "evil" call me "tide is on your side"
Anything that you want
Anybody knows you can conjure anything
By the dark of the moon, boy
And if you keep your silence, silencer on
You’ll talk yourself right into a job, out of a hole
Into my bayou, into my, my bayou

Suede
I’m sure that you’ve been briefed
My absorption lines, they are frayed
And I fear my fear is greater than my faith
But I walk the missionary way
You always felt like suede
There are days I am your twin
Peekaboo, hiding underneath your skin
Jets are revving, yes, revving from an ether twist

Call me "evil" call me "tide is on your side"
Anything that you want
Anybody knows you can conjure anything
By the dark of the moon, boy
And if you keep your silence, silencer on
You’ll talk yourself right into a job, out of a hole
Into my bayou, into my, my bayou

Suede

Oh, little sister, I hope you didn’t feel that way
Oh, little sister, I’m glad you came, and I said
Oh, little sister, I hoped you wouldn’t feel that way
Oh, little sister, oh, again when I said
Oh, little sister, I hope you didn’t feel that way and
Oh, I’m still glad you came, I said
Oh, little sister, I wished you didn’t feel that way
And oh, little girl I’d do the same
Oh, little sister, I hoped you wouldn’t feel that way
Oh, I said I wished
Oh, little sister, you’ll forgive me one day
You’ll forgive me one...
