Concertina Lyrics
Clouds descending
I’m not policing what you think and dream
I run into your thought from across the room
Just another trick, can I weather this?

I’ve got a fever above my waist
You got a squeezebox on your knee
I know the truth is in between
The 1st and 40th drink

Concertina, concertina, a chill that bends
This I swear, you’re the fiercest calm I’ve been in
Concertina, concertina, try infrared
This I swear, you’re the fiercest calm I’ve been in

The soul-quake happened here in a glass world
Particle by particle she slowly changes
She likes hanging Chinese paper cuts
Just another fix, can I weather this?

I got my fuzz all tipped to play
I got a dub on your landscape
Then there’s your policy of trancing
The sauce without the blame
Concertina, concertina a chill that bends
This I swear, you’re the fiercest calm I’ve been in
Concertina, concertina, try infrared
This I swear, you’re the fiercest calm I’ve been in

Too far, too far, too far
It could all get way too cheerful, now

I’ve got a fever above my waist
You got a squeezebox on your knee
I know the truth lies in between
The 1st and 40th drink

Concertina, concertina a chill that bends
This I swear you’re the fiercest calm I’ve been in
Concertina, concertina try infrared
This I swear you’re the fiercest calm I’ve been in
