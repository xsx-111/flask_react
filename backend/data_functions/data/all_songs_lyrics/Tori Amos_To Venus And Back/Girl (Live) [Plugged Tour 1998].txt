Girl (Live)  Lyrics
From in the shadow she calls
And in the shadow she finds a way, finds a way
And in the shadow she crawls
Clutching her faded photograph
My image under her thumb
Yes, with a message for my heart
Yes, with a message for my heart

She's been everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own

Hey, and in the doorway they stay
And laugh as violins fill with water
Screams from the bluebells can't make them go away
Well I'm not seventeen, but I've cuts on my knees
Falling down as the winter takes one more cherry tree

She's been everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everyone else's girl
Maybe one day
I said she'll be her own
Rushing rivers thread so thin, limitation
Dreams with the flying pigs turbid blue
And the drug stores too safe
In their coats and in their do's yeah
Yeah, smother in our hearts, a pillow to my dots
One day, one day she'll be her own

And in the mist, there she rides
And castles are burning in my heart
And as I twist I hold tight
And I ride to work every morning wondering why
"Sit in the chair and be good now"
And become all that they told you
The white coats enter her room and I'm calling my baby
Calling my baby, calling, I'm calling

Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her own
Everybody else's girl
Maybe one day she'll be her ownEmbed
