Spring Haze Lyrics
Well I know it’s just a spring haze
But I don’t much like the look of it
And if omens are a godsend like men
Breezing in

Certain these clouds go somewhere
Billowing out to somewhere

In a single-engine Cessna
You say we’ll never make it there
So all we do is circle it

Uh-oh, let go, off on my way
Unseen this eternal wanting
Uh-oh, way to go, so I get creamed
Waiting for Sunday to drown
Uh-oh, way to go, waiting on Sunday
Waiting on Sunday to land
Uh-oh, way to go, waiting on Sunday
Waiting on Sunday to drown

So I know it’s just a spring haze
But I don’t much like the look of it
And all we do is circle it
And I found out where my edge is
And it bleeds into where you resist
And my only way, way out, is to go
So far in
Billowing out to somewhere
Billowing out Luna Riviera
Billowing out to somewhere

Uh-oh, let go, off on my way
Unseen this eternal wanting
Let go, so if I really get creamed
Waiting for Sunday to drown
Waiting on Sunday to drown

Why does it always end up like this?
Why does it always end up like this?
Why does it always end up like this?

Let go, uh-oh, off on my way
Unseen this eternal wanting
Let go, way to go, so I get creamed
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Uh-oh, waiting on, waiting on Sunday
Waiting on Sunday to land
Uh-oh, waiting on, waiting on Sunday
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Waiting on Sunday to drown
Waiting on Sunday
Waiting on Sunday to land
Uh-oh, so if I really get creamed
I'm waiting for Sunday to drownEmbed
