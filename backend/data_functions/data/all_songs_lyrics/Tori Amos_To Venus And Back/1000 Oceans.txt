1000 Oceans Lyrics
These tears I’ve cried, I’ve cried a thousand oceans
And if it seems I’m floating in the darkness, well

I can’t believe that I would keep, keep you from flying
And I would cry a thousand more if that’s what it takes
To sail you home, sail you home, sail you home

I’m aware what the rules are, but you know that I will run
You know that I will follow you
Over Silbury hill, through the solar field
You know that I will follow you

And if I find you, will you still remember playing at the trains?
Or does this li-, little blue ball just fade away

Over Silbury hill, though the solar field
You know that I will follow you
I’m aware what the rules are, but you know that I will run
You know that I will follow you

These tears I’ve cried, I’ve cried a thousand oceans
And if it seems I’m floating in the darkness, well
I can’t believe that I would keep, keep you from flying
So I will cry a thousand more if that’s what it takes
To sail you home, sail you home, sail you home
Sail, sail you homeEmbed
