Cornflake Girl (Live)  Lyrics
"Some of you know my wonderful brothers on stage, I love them dearly. This is Caton on guitar. And this creature who hits things, this is Matt Chamberlain. And this is the wonderful Jon Evans on bass."
You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
And you try and prove me wrong
You swear to Christ she won't
On your life she won't
But it seems to go wrong
You swear to Christ she won't
On your life she won't
But that heart

I never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Givin' us the old heave ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go it's sleepy time

This is not really, this, a-this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword
She knows, she knows what's goin on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They musta paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love

This is not really, this, this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

No, sir, never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the, put the, put the things girl?
Like your heart and I swear it's the best thing that you can do
That way you do, that way you do, that thing you call
Where'd you put, where'd you put the keys, girl?

And the man with the
Thinks he knows
Thinks he knows so much, boys
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much
And the man with the
Thinks he knows
Thinks he knows so much, yes
And the man with the golden gun
Thinks he knows
Thinks he knows


Rabbit, where'd you put the keys, little girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the, put the things?
Like your heart and you swear it's so hard
Well, I don't know what that does, but, anymore, but
Like your heart and you swear it's so hard
Well where'd you put the keys, girl?Embed
