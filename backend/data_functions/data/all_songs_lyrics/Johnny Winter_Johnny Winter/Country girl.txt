Ah baby, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ah baby, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're just a little country girl
You don't know what's going on
Ah baby, I'll never trust your love again
Ah baby, I'll never trust your love again
The way your treat me mama, you know I'm dead as sin
Ya got my heart a achin', I love you so
The doctor couldn't ? I can't stand it no more
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Just a little country girl
You never gonna ?
Yeah, yeah
Ah yeah
Got my heart a achin', I love her so
The doctor couldn't ? I can't stand it no more
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
You're just a little country girl
You don't know what's going onEmbed
