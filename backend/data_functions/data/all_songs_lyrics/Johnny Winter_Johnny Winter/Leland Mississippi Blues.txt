Leland Mississippi Blues Lyrics(Don't mess up slut and I won't either 1-2-3-4)
Oh yeah, oh yeah, uh huh, oh yeah
I've been in Texas
I've been on the run
I've been in Texas
I've been on the run
I'm going to Leland
Mississippi, mama
You all know that's where I come from
Right down on the Delta, man
Well, I'm alone, baby, I'm free free from my home
Well, I'm alone, I'm free from my home
You know I was sittin' right down people
On my daddy's cotton farm
Come hear, baby, let your long hair down
Ah, come here, woman, let your hair down
I want you to love me with a feeling'Cause I'm Mississippi bound
The best woman, the best waist in town
The best woman, the best waist in town
Oh yeah
You'll never keep me woman
'Cause I have a travellin' mindEmbed
