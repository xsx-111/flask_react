Back Door Friend LyricsEvery married woman, I believe
Has to have some backdoor friend
Every married woman, you know
She has some backdoor friend
When you are gone, yeah darlin'
He comes slippin' in
Ain't no married woman that's gonna
Treat nobody right
Ain't no married woman that's gonna
Treat nobody right
She lay around with a cute man all day
And's pretty sick of her husband at night
You know you make it to your house
Knock on your front door
Run around the back, I'll believe
You'll catch him there
Just before he goes 'round the corner
Every married woman, you know
Has some backdoor friend
You know when you walk out
Yeah, man, he comes slippin' inEmbed
