Be Careful with a Fool LyricsWoman, be careful with a fool
You know, someday he may get smart
Be careful with a fool
You know, someday he may get smart
He will treat you so cool and chilly
Till he will hurt you to your heart
Yeah, you know, hate to remember
Oh, what a fool I used to be, ha, ha
Man, I hate to remember
How foolish I used to be
The way I used to love you, Woman
How bad it's gonna be
You know, I used to cry 'bout you, Woman
You know, I'd walk the streets late at night
Used to cry about ya
Walk the streets late at night
If you love me just a little bit, baby
Why in the world don't you treat me right?
Ah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Ah
Yeah, baby
Uh, it's like finally over, baby, whoa
I believe this is the end, ah, ah, yeah
Finally over, baby, oh, I believe this is the end, ah
I want to tell my baby, to forgive me for my sin1Embed
