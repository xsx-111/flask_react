Good Morning Little Schoolgirl LyricsGood morning little schoolgirl, good morning little schoolgirl

When I was twelve, baby when I was twelve years old
You know I was looking for a schoolgirl just to, eat my jelly roll, yeah

Can I go home with, can I go home with you, ah, yeah
Tell your mother and your father, I'm a little schoolboy, yes a schoolboyEmbed
