Icebound Stream LyricsWatch, I can flash across the sky
A lightning bolt from up on high
And I can crash into myself
Now, a flower blooms in reverse
And a song takes back a verse
A photograph fades to white
And I can hold a thunderhead in my heart
And in my bed, I can dream a winter's gale
And wake up drenched
A stormy pale, a stormy pale
A battered heath on the shore
Will make her keep and wait for more
But underneath her icebound stream
The water pours, the water pours
And I can hold a thunderhead in my heart
And in my bed, I can dream a winter's gale
And wake up drenched
A stormy pale, a stormy paleEmbed
