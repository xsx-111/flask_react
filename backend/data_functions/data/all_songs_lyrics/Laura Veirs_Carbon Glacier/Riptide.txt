Riptide LyricsRiptide pulls me out into the open sea
My toes dangle for a place to stand and be
Oh starry night come and chart a course
Or send me a boat with an anchor set
I'll pull myself ashore
Left with essence
Of the moon and stars and night
There's no other route
I cannot take self to flight
I'll float here with the shrimp and brine
And on my cheeks and hair
The salt will always shine
And with this phosphorescence map
A sailor's chart a mermaid's hand
Something i'll find
Oh starry night come and chart a courseâ€¦Embed
