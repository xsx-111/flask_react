Snow Camping LyricsI saw the violet turn to night
I saw the water turn to ice
A thousand snowflakes hovered â€˜round me
The world aglow
I heard a distant songbird singing
A song the words i used to know
And as the melody went ringing
I felt my bones on the rocks below
The weighted trees of my only home
With brother sleeping right beside me
The blankets pulled up to his chin
The makeshift snow cave settled slightly
But held us in and sheltered us
Like mom and dad, they always helped usEmbed
