Rapture LyricsWith photographs
And magnetic tape
We capture
Pretty animals in cages
Pretty flowers in vases
Enraptured
And doesn't the tree
Write great poetry?
Doing itself so well
Do you blame Monet?
His gardens in Giverny
He captured
And lovely Bash≈ç
His plunking ponds and toads
Enraptured
The fate of Kurt Cobain
Junk coursing through his veins
And young Virginia Woolf
Death came and hung her coat
Love of color, sound and words
Is it a blessing or a curse?
