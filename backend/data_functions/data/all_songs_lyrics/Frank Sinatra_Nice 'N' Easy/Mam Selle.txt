Mam Selle LyricsA small Cafe Mam'selle, our rendezvous, Mam'selle
The violins were warm and sweet, and so were you Mam'selle
And as the night danced by, a kiss became a sigh
Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle just like wine does
No heart ever yearned the way that mine does for you
And yet I know too well someday you'll say goodbye
Then violins will cry, and so will I Mam'selleEmbed
