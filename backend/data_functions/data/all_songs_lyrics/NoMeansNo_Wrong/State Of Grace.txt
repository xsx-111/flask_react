State Of Grace LyricsFirst I told myself there was no more
Than the sound of the wind through an open door
And if no one entered, it was no crime
At least it was none of mine
And all I saw, I kept at bay
An empty heart in an empty space
There was no reason for me to live
I had nothing to give, nothing to give
I closed my eyes, and to my surprise
My heart was beating, I was still alive
Was there really nothing I could do?
No, it can't be true
I've been lying to myself
Lying to myself for so long
I've been lying to myself
Lying to myself, and it can't go on
'cause I'm lying in a state
I'm lying in a state of grace
I'm lying in a state
I've been lying to myself and it can't go on
At first I tried to blame the world
For all the evils that were unfurled
Flags of sin blowing in the wind
Over church and state
The rich and the great
But when I listened all I really heard
Were my own voice and my own words
Sometimes begging for love
Sometimes screaming with hate
Screaming with hate
Well I don't trust that voice in my head
It's not mine, it's the voice of the dead
And why do you ask me what I think is true?
I learned it all from you!
I've been lying to myself
Lying to myself for so long
I've been lying to myself
Lying to myself, and it can't go on
'cause I'm lying in a state
I'm lying in a state of grace
I'm lying in a state
I've been lying to myself and it can't go on
In the end you are my only friend
And all I see is you
And all I have to give, my friend
I will give it to you
Who do I mean?
Who am I talking to?
How could it be more plain?
Wake up, look in your heart
Who are you?
What is your name?
If I take a shit in your perfect world
It's only so you'll know me by my smell
And though you turn away like you don't understand
You know all to well
You don't want to look
You don't want to touch
You don't want to pay
'cause it costs so much
You just smile and wish me well
Well you can go to hell!
'cause I'm lying in a state
I'm lying in a state of grace
I'm lying in a state
I've been lying to myself and it can't go onEmbed
