Rags And Bones LyricsWell, Christ was married on the cross
My father was married to my mother
And I am married to a cigarette butt
Lying in the gutter
I am married to a cigarette butt
Lying in the gutter
Well, that's too bad
Rags and bones
Are we finally alone?
White man, you, you, you, you
You just startin' to get the blues
Yeah, the blues
(Sing it:)
Rags and bones
Are we finally alone?
The beast has arisen
All sins are forgiven
In the belly of the beast
I shall be released
She rises
Captain
Captain
Dive! Dive!
If I could choose to believe
Or not to believe
You know I would choose not to
But I can't choose not to
No bloody way
Rags and bones
Are we finally alone?
Any old rags and bones?
Who would've thought that I would be
A sailor on the deep blue sea
Any old rags and bones?Embed
