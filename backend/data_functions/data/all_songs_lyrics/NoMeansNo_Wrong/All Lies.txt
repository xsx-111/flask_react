All Lies LyricsLies are the words that I use
When you look up hopefully
All of the things that we feel
Are a trick, a fantasy
What is the end?
Is it love I pretend?
It's calling, It's calling
And I'm falling, I'm falling
And she said pray to me, pray to me
All the love you see, it comes from me
She said pray to me, pray to me
All the love you see, it belongs to me
She said I see, I see, I see, I see
She said pray to me, pray to me
Pray to me, pray to me, but it was
All lies, a pack of lies, it was all lies
Why don't you fuck off and die
It was all lies, a pack of lies
It was all lies, all lies
Lies are the light and hope
In your eyes as they shine on me
Tie up my hands with your chains
They are bound to set me free
I'm singing, I'm singing
And to that I'm clinging
The words that I say
Only drag me away
And I said pray to me, pray to me
All the love you see, it comes from me
I said pray to me, pray to me
All the love you see, it belongs to me
I said I see, I see, I see, I see
I said pray to me, pray to me
Pray to me, pray to me, but it was
All lies, a pack of lies, it was all lies
Why don't you fuck off and die
It was all lies, a pack of lies
It was all lies, all lies
Lies are the hopes and the chains
That have dragged me here to you
All the hopes and these chains
I will gladly share with you
It's raining, it's pouring
The old man is snoring
It's raining it's pouring
And I'm falling, I'm falling
And she said pray to me, pray to me
All the love you see, it comes from me
He say pray to me, pray to me
All the love I see belongs to me
He said I see, I see, I see, I see
He say pray to me, pray to me
Pray to me, pray to me, but it was
All lies, a pack of lies, it was all lies
Why don't you fuck off and die
It was all lies, a pack of lies
It was all lies, all liesEmbed
