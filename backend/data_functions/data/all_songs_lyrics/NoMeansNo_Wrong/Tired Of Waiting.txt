Tired Of Waiting LyricsTired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting, waiting for the news
Tired of waiting for things to improve
Tired of waiting, waiting for your letter
Tired of waiting for things to get better
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
Tired of waiting, waiting for the phone
Tired of waiting, here all alone
Tired of waiting for something new
Tired of waiting for you
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired!
Tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired of waiting
I got tired, tired, tired!
(I got so tired....)
I got tired of waiting, waiting in line
Tired of waiting for my clothes to dry
Tired of waiting for his show to begin
Tired of waiting for my ship to come in
Tired of waiting, waiting for the bus
Tired of waiting for my shoes to get fixed
Tired of waiting, waiting for my cheque
Tired of waiting for a change in the weather
Tired of waiting for the water to boil
Tired of waiting for the paint to dry
Tired of waiting, waiting for a sign
Tired of waiting for my big break
Tired of waiting for the dam to break
Tired of waiting for the bomb to drop
Tired of waiting and waiting and waiting
I got tired of waiting for the end
I got tired of waiting because I found out
There's only a very very fine line between
Biding one's time and wasting one's time
Do you know what I mean?
I got tired of waiting that's allEmbed
