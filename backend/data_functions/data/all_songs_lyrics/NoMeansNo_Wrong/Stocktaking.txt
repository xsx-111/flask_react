Stocktaking LyricsAre you getting what you want?
And are you getting what you need?
I've heard it said that love is truly sacred
But nowhere is it written that it's guaranteed
Who decides what will happen
And who decides who for?
Is this just a crazy little game
Or is this just an ugly little war?
Are you sick and tired of the same old thing
Or are you happy enough?
Tell me
When does so much become so little?
When does too little become too much?Embed
