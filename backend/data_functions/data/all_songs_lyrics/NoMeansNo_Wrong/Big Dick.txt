Big Dick LyricsLike a monkey in the zoo
You're half gorilla too
When you pound it with your fist
And make it real stiff
Big dick
Gotta cover your mistake
Your bloody outtakes
So you dip it in the wine
And make a holy sign
Big dick
Big dick! Come quick
Big dick! Come quick
Well you're running up a tree
You're trying not to scream
But you are pounding on your chest
Like you wipped the best
Big dick
The rivers of blood
You've spilled have turned to mud
Now the flies are buzzin' round
Don't it make a loud sound
Big dick
Big dick! Come quick
Big dick! Come quick
It won't be long
Till those bad bits are gone
It won't be long
Till those bad bits are gone
Now we are sitting by the fire
But daddy's getting tired
'cause he's drunk the whole crock
Now he's got a limp cock
Big dick
Big dick! Come quick
Big dick! Come quick

'Hey, uh, what's an nice girl like you doing in a place like this? I've been staring atcha all night ... You wanna come back to my place for a little, uh, nightcap? Actually I'm a political science major, huh-huh. . .'
That's all folk!Embed
