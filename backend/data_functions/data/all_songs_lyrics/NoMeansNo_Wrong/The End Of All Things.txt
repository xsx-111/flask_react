The End Of All Things LyricsYou are here
I am here
Fear
Bound in fear
We are here
I see nothing
All is clear
Crystal clear
Fear
All that's here
Pain and fear
I see here
Nothing
Hear the angels sing
This is the end of all things
All is clear
Nothing's here
Fear
What is fear?
Nothing's here
I see here
Nothing
Hear the angels sing
This is the end of all thingsEmbed
