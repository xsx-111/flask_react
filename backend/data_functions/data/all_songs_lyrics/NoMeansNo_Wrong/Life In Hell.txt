Life In Hell LyricsFoolish girl in swelling woman
Here's a blunt knife for your bosom
Here's the devil's hand to shake
Watch what the others try to take
Hell
Life in hell
By your loving disposition
You let him get into position
And train is rising gun upon
The cervix of your inner sun
Hell
Life in hell
Can you not distinguish pain?
Red nail and red shame
Woman, world in one complete
Your heart's awake, your mind's asleep
You spread your inner sun to make
A den for some sly, bassing snake
Which burns stronger?
I can't tell
The glowing sun?
Or fiery hell?
Hell
Life in hellEmbed
