I Am Wrong LyricsI know what I know
I'm no hero
Say yes, say no
Don't come, come close
Wrong
Be strong, be strong
Don't be all wrong
Don't wait or hesitate
Take care, beware
Wrong
I am wrong
I feel great, let's celebrate
It's a sunny day, let's dance and play
Never fear, love is here
Never fear, love is..
Be straight, don't lie
Don't tell, tell why
I know what I know
I'm no hero
Wrong
I am wrong
I feel great, let's celebrate
It's a sunny day, let's dance and play
Never fear, love is here
Never fear, love is..
Step into my parlour
Said the spider to the fly
And we could share a love
That would never die
I know what I know
I'm no hero
Don't wait or hesitate
Be strong
Be wrong
I am wrongEmbed
