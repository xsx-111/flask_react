The Tower Lyrics
The sword of truth is just another weapon
Let me live for one more second
I see a woman
She's holding flowers
A bouquet of roses that are blood red
From a burning building
A man leaps to his death
I stand above these mansions of the dead
Red tombs and above us looms

The Tower 
I see red 
I see a tower against the sky
Beneath a red unblinking eye

Radio waves curve and cross
I stand below them - Lost!
Above me is a black obelisk
And the dangers that I risk
Here gather the ghosts of the mind
That tear my heart and here I find
All the traps that have been set
Everything I would forget, beneath...

Violence is close at hand
You are damned if you do
And if you don't - Damned!
A red eye, a tyrant full of hate
Glares from the sky, its captive state
If it should blink or deviate
A thousand worlds would obliterate
I do not move, nor do I speak
Beneath that hard and pitiless peak
Of concrete, steel and antenna wheels
