Oh No Bruno! LyricsToo much, stay out all night
Too much, but that's alright
Too much, do it to it
Too much, now do it again
Too much, play for steinies
Too much, play for cash
Too much, put up or shut up
Too much is not enough
Oh no! Bruno!
Too much is not enough
Too much, hit the nightclubs
Too much, drink champagne
Too much, double bullseye
Too much, do that again
Too much, stay out all night
Too much, but that's alright
Too much, such a big guy
Too much is not enough
Oh no! Bruno!
Too much is not enough
Too much, no escaping
Too much, you've been framed
Too much, the cops are knocking
Too much, no not again!
Oh no! Bruno!
Too much is not enough
Ten... twenty for two... thirty for six
You son of a bitch, go!
Oh no! Bruno!
Too much, too much, too much, too much
No!Embed
