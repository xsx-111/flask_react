Two Lips, Two Lungs And One Tongue LyricsHe kept trying
He kept trying
But he couldn’t find out
Why he couldn’t stop crying
Only so many songs can be sung
With two lips, two lungs and one tongue
She kept praying
She kept praying
That she would understand
What she was saying
Only so many songs can be sung
With two lips, two lungs and one tongue
He kept dreaming
He kept dreaming
Of the day they’d realize
What he was feeling
Only so many songs can be sung with two lips, two lungs and one tongue
Only so many songs can be sung with two lips, two lungs and one tongue
Only so many songs can be sung with two lips, two lungs and one tongue
Only so many songs can be sung with two lips, two lungs and one tongueEmbed
