Bounce That Lyrics(Purple Ribbon All-Stars)
I be on it all night man I be on that all day
Straight up pimp, if you want me you can find me in the air
I be on it all night, all night, all night x4
I be on that kryptonite
Straight up on that kryptonite
I be on that straight up on that
I be on that kryptonite
Time and Time again I gotta turn back round and tell these hoes
That i am the H-N-I-C bitch that's just the way it goes
I be on that shit better have you on that I don't want no more
At this time I need all my freak hoes to get down on the floor
If you came to rep your shit, break that nigga let him know
If its jail I get for stomping haters to sleep, fuck it, I go
Freak I'll be off in your sheets, straight geeked, swervin down your street
In a stolen Bonville with 23's on the feet
I be on that kryptonite
Straight up on that kryptonite
I be on that straight up on that
I be on that kryptonite
I be on it all night man I be on that all day
Straight up pimp, if you want me you can find me in the air
Let me see it
Let me see it
You can find me
Let me see it
Bounce that x4
You can find me
Bounce that bounce that
Let me see it
Let me see it
You can find me
Let me see it
Bounce that x4
You can find me in the air
Let me see it
Bounce that bounce that x8
Bounce that bounce that

All I wanna do is do a zoom zoom zoom in your boom boom
(Ludacris)
Southern-style, get wild, old school's comin’ down in a different color whip, whip, whip
Picture perfect, you might wanna take a flick, flick, flick, flick, flick
Call up Jazze tell him pop up the bottles cuz we got another hit, hit, hit
Wanna go platinum? I'm who you should get get get get get
Ludacris on the track, get back, trick, switch on the ‘Lac, I'm flexin' steel
Same price different time, hot song, jumped on cuz Ciara got sex appeal
And I keep the meanest, cleanest, baddest, spinnin' on stainless wheels
Could care less about your genius, I bump ya status, I keep the stainless steelEmbed
