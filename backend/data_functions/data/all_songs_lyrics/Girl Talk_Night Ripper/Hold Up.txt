Hold Up LyricsNo one can tell me what i'm doing wrong today
Whenever i see you smile
No one can tell me what i'm doing wrong today
Go go go go (x4)
You can hate me now
But i won't stop now
But i can't stop now
You can hate me now
But i won't stop now
But i can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now
Don’t hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin, sixes, money foldin
Bitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style’s greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you’d rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest
Gurl shake dat laffy taffy
Dat laffy taffy
Shake dat laffy taffy
Dat laffy taffy
Gurl shake dat laffy taffy
Dat laffy taffy
Dat laffy taffy (candy gurl)
Dat laffy taffy
(X2)
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, wait a minute
(bunch of times)Embed
