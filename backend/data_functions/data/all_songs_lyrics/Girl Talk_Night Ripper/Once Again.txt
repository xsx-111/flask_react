Once Again Lyrics(Ludacris)
Hey girl how ya doin
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin
I would like to get to know ya can you gimme ya name
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange
Hey
See I'm the man of this town and I hope
You wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got people to meet and many places to see
(Fabolous)
Breathe (x8)
(Ludacris)
Mmm
I'm really diggin ya lips
But be careful where you walkin when you swingin them hips
I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin a crash
Wit ya traffic jam booty, heads pausin so fast
Heyy
I wouldn't trade you for the world I swear it
I like 'ya hair and every style that ya wear it
And how the colors coordinate wit ya clothes
From your manicured nails to ya pedicured toes
(Ying-Yang Twins)
Wait til you see my dick
Wait til you see my dick
Ay bitch! wait til you see my dick
Imma beat dat pussy up (x8)
(Slim Thug)
I don't take 'em out to eat
I ain't here to trick or treat
I ain't trying to fix your weave
I ain't heard of that
I'm just here to train hoes
Put 'em on the main road
(Arrested Development)
But I am still thirsty
(The Five Stairsteps)
Ooh-oo child
Things are gonna get easier
Ooh-oo child
Things'll get brighterEmbed
