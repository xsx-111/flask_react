Victims of Comfort LyricsNo rocket's gonna fly that high
There's no escaping the enemy, It's you and I
We've poisoned up the water
We're chokin' on the air
Let's stop before it gets too late
Or is it already too late?
Is it already too late?
For the victims of comfort
Got no one else to blame
We're just the victims of comfort
Connoisseurs of pain
It's a technological merry-go-round
Dangerous illusions buried under the ground
And everyone likes a party
But no one wants to clean
Well I'd like to see a change somehow
But I'm a little busy right now
Just a little busy right now
I'm just a victim of comfort
I got no one else to blame
I'm just a victim of comfort
A cryin' shame
Oh and what do we got to lose?
Everything
Yes and what do we stand to gain?
Everything, so let's try together
Before we have to cry together
It's too soon to die together
I'm just a victim of comfort
Got no one else to blame
I'm just a victim of comfort
Connoisseur of pain
We were victims of comfort
Got no one else to blame
I'm just a victim of comfort
Cryin' shameEmbed
