Anybody Seen My Girl LyricsNone of my businesses's gettin' all of my concern
I tried to put out the fire, but the flames still burn
And as she pleases, she comes and goes
She's got the wind in her hair
She never ceases to hurt me so
Does she really care?
Is she ever comin' home? Is she ever gonna phone?
Another nicht alone...
Has anybody seen my girl? Has anybody seen my woman?
California, Tennesse, send my baby home to me!
Where am i goin' or what am i gonna do?
I know i'm not crazy, i'm just hooked on you
So go on and use me, endlessly, could you let me know
When you need me, hold me close and, baby, don't let go
Are you ever comin' home? Are you ever gonna phone?
Another night alone...
Has anybody seen my girl? Has anybody seen my woman?
California, Tennesse, send my baby home to me!
Has anybody seen my girl? Has anybody seen my woman?
California, Tennesse, send my baby home to me
... home to me&33Embed
