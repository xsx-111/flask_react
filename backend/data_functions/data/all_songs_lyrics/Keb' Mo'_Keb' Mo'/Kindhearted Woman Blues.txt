Kindhearted Woman Blues LyricsI got a kindhearted woman, do anything in this world for me
I got a kindhearted woman, do anything in this world for me
But these evil hearted women will not let me be
Well, I love my baby, my baby don't love me
Well, I love my baby, ooh, my baby don't love me
But I really love that woman, can't stand to leave her be
Now, there ain't but the one thing that make me want to drink
I's worried 'bout the way you treat me and I begin to think
Oh, babe, my life won't feel the same
You breaks my heart when you call Mr. So and So name
Someday, someday, baby, I will shake your hand goodbye
Someday, someday, someday, someday, baby
I will shake your hand goodbye
Can't give you no more of my love 'cause I just ain't satisfiedEmbed
