Tell Everybody I Know LyricsIt's no secret, I don't care
Gonna shout it out everywhere
I love my baby, hot, cold, fast or slow
I love my baby, gonna tell everybody I know
In the evening in my bed
I hear voices in my head
They say, "never, never ever let her go"
Well, I love my baby, gonna tell everybody I know
Yes, I love my baby, gonna tell everybody I know
Other women don't mean a thing to me
You can pick 'em all up, drop 'em all in the sea
If I got no money, she don't care
She'll open up her pocket book and pay my fare
I know she loves me, up, down, high or low
Well, I love my baby, gonna tell everybody I know
Yes, I love my baby, gonna tell everybody I know
Other women don't mean a thing to me
You can pick 'em all up, drop 'em all in the sea
'Cause if I got no money, you know she don't care
She'll open up her pocket book and pay my fare
I know she loves me, up, down, high or low
Well, I love my baby, gonna tell everybody I know
Yes, I love my baby, gonna tell everybody I know
She's a sweet thing
She's a fine thing
She's a loving thing
Gonna tell everybody I know
Tell everybody I know
Tell everybody I know
Tell everybody I know
She's a sweet thing
Loving thing
I know she loves me, hot, cold, fast or slow
Gonna tell everybody I know
You know I love my babyEmbed
