Love Blues LyricsI love the way you love me
An' I love the way you comb your hair
I love the way you love me baby
Love the way you comb your hair
If it was left up to me baby
You wouldn't never get to go no where
Hey sweet mama, baby don't you go too far
Hey sweet mama, baby don't you go too far
I wanna know where you is every minute
Who you're with and where you are
I love you baby so please don't you
Leave me here all alone
I can't stand it baby when you
Leave me here all alone
So where ever you decide to go baby
Just don't stay gone too long
Love you baby, I just can't leave you alone
You know I Love you baby, And I just can't leave you alone
I love you baby jus' like a, jus' like a dog loves a bone
I'm gon' wrap my arms around you
Squeeze you 'til I cry
I'm gon' wrap my arms around you
Squeeze you 'til I cry...Yes I am
Girl I'm gon' keep on lovin' you baby
'Til the day I die.....
That's gon' be a long timeEmbed
