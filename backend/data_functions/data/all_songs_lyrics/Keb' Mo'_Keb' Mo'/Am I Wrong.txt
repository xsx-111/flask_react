Am I Wrong LyricsAm I wrong
Fallin in love with you
Tell me am I wrong
Well
Fallin in love with you
While your other man was out there
Cheatin and lyin
Steppin all over you
Uh
Sweet thing
Tell me am I wrong
Holdin on to you so tight
Tell me
Tell me
Am I wrong
Holdin on to you so tight
If your other man come to claim you
He'd better be ready
Ready for a long long fight
Well I gotta be strong
Well I know you're dependin on me
You know I gotta be strong
I know you're dependin on me
To give you all of my attention
All of my time
And all of the love you need
Oh tell me
Am I wrong
Tryin to hold on to you
Tell me am I wrong
Tryin to hold on to you
I just wanna make a home for you baby
And all of your children too
Tell me am I wrong
Fallin in love with you
Gotta tell me am I wrong
Fallin in love with you
While your other man was out there
Cheatin and lyin
Steppin all over you
While your other man was out there
Cheatin and lyin
Steppin all over youEmbed
