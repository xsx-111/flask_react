Stepping Stone Lyrics
Well, I'm a man
At least, I'm trying to be
But I've learned before
That other half of me
I said, I'm a man
Look across the deep blue sea
But I ain't gonna search
For nothing desperately
Hey, I'm trying, trying
Trying to keep my cool
Well, I'm trying to keep my gloom
Yea, yea, yea
Well, until I find that sweet love of mine
I'm just a rolling
Screaming, tumbling
Crying, girly loving, rolling stone

Hey, if you're a woman
At least, you say you are
You're a woman
At least, you look like you are
You're a woman
At least, you say you are
But you make it off, in bed with my guitar
And you leave the real me outside
To leave out, 'round the nighttime
You say you just want a ticket to ride
You don't give a damn about-
You're just a screaming
Didn't love 'ya sometimes
But a, rolling, tumbling, stepping, stepping stone
That's all you-
Stepping stone


Yes, I find myself riding down the highways of desire
Lord, I gotta keep my fire, keep my fireEmbed
