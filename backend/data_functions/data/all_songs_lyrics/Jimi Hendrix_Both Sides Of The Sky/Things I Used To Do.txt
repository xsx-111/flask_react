Things I Used To Do LyricsThe things that I used to do, lord, I won't do no more
Said the things that I used to do, say I won't do no more, yeah
I used to run and hold your hand baby and cry, oh babe do not go child
I used to search all night for you baby
All my search would all end in vain
Said I search all night for you
Lord, and my search would all end in vain
But I knew all the time baby now
That you was hid out wit' your other man
I'm goin' to lead you on home dear baby
Try somewhere else love one more time
Gonna lead you home dear baby
Try somewhere else love one more time
The way you mistreat me child
I'm about to lose my mindEmbed
