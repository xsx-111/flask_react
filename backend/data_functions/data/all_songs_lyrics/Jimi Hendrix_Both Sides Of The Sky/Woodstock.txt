Woodstock LyricsI came upon a child of god
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, where are you going
And this he told me
I‘m going on down to Yasgur's farm
I‘m going to join in a rock ‘n' roll band
I've got to get back to the land
And set my soul free
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
Then can I walk beside you
I have come here to lose the smog
And i feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
By the time we got to woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And i dreamed i saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterﬂies
Above our nation
We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the gardenEmbed
