Fortune LyricsFrom ancient times to the present day
There have been those who have claimed her as a lover
So driven by the will to possess
Have pursued her to the very ends of the earth
We enter into it, it enters into us
We enter into it, it enters into us
As the wheel spins and turns
The fortunate ones are seen to emerge
We enter into it, it enters into us
Fortune smiles upon our heads
Mistakenly we cling to her warm embrace
How easily we seem to forgive and forget
I'm lost in the security of our new found wealth
There are those of you amongst us
Bearing vacant faces and empty smiles
Their fates have already been decided upon
They will leave behind them only the victims of their misplaced trust
We enter into it, it enters into us
We enter into it, it enters into us
As the wheel spins and turns
The fortunate ones are seen to emerge
We enter into it, it enters into us
Fortune smiles upon our heads
Mistakenly we cling to her warm embrace
How easily we seem to forgive and forget
I'm lost in the security of our new found wealth
Fortune smiles upon our heads
Fortune smiles upon our headsEmbed
