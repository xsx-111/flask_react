Ocean LyricsDead
Dead
Isabella, she's dead
Isabella, she's dead
She's dead
Dead
Isabella, she's dead
Isabella, she's dead
Isabella, she's dead
Isabella lover
He's there
He slayed her, slayed her
Isabella
Dawn, it's so dark
Isabella, she's dead
But you, you're there
You're there
Beginning, beginning
To sunset to the day begun
But you, you're there
You're there
She's dead
Oh, dead
He said
Isabella, she's dead
Isabel'
Isabel'
Isabella, she's dead
Isabella, she's dead
Isabella, she's dead
Isabella lover
He's there
He slayed her, slayed her
Isabella
Dawn, it's so dark
Isabella, she's dead
But you, you're there
You're there
Beginning, beginning
To sunset to the day begun
But you, you're there
You're thereEmbed
