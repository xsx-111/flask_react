Frontier LyricsPlease, go after him
'Cause he delayed them there
I see the proud man
He delayed to see them all
All have stayed
The bloodstains on the floor
He left, he's left
He's gone today
He's gone back
He's gone back
I just want to make him understand
Teach another lesson
Make them go and see the proud manEmbed
