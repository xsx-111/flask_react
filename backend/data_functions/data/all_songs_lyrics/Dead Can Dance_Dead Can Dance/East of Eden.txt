East of Eden LyricsI was told this in a distant land
Where tortured souls have to fight together in anguish
And the scenes of the show
Are of a cruel and violent nature
Scenes of pain and cruelty
Are there to be seen
The arena, the town, the place was set
For all to watch and see
I was told this in a distant land
Where the oppressor ruled with an iron hand
And the mission of saddened complacency
Left cold and emotionless by history
Scenes of pain and cruelty
Are there to be seen
All the while I should have known
It was you killing me
Somewhere east of Eden
The designs will never change
Vented through others' fear
The world stops at the end of the hall
We watch the life force fade away
And that's the price we shall have to pay
Once you are dead
How could the children have knownEmbed
