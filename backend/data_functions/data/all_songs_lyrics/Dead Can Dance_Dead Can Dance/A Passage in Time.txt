A Passage in Time LyricsThese silent chances pass one by
Who never knew of them at all
Resigned to the hands of fate
We await her impending beck and call
Until we return, paradise interred
Spread your golden wings, let the sails unfurl
Until we return, paradise interred
Spread your golden wings, let the fires burn
These silent chances pass one by
Who never knew of them at all
Resigned to the hands of fate
We await her impending beck and call
Until we return, paradise interred
Spread your golden wings, let the sails unfurl
Until we return, paradise interred
Spread your golden wings, let the sails unfurl
Well, opportunity's doors did not open wide
The answers remain locked away inside
Locked away inside
Locked away inside
Locked away inside
Locked away inside
So forced into labour we till the earth
To sow the seeds of our own rebirth
As the days turned into years
Our faith overcame any doubts or fears
Any doubts or fears
Are there any doubts or fears?
Any doubts or fears
Are there any doubts or fears?
In truth we had found the key
But its application would unravel this mystery
This mystery
This mystery
This mystery
This mysteryEmbed
