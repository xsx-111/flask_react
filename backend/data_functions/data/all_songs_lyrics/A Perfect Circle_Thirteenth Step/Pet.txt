Pet Lyrics
Don't fret, precious, I'm here
Step away from the window (Step away from the window)
Go back to sleep

Lay your head down, child
I won't let the boogeyman come
Count the bodies like sheep
To the rhythm of the war drums
Pay no mind to the rabble
Pay no mind to the rabble
Head down, go to sleep
To the rhythm of the war drums

Pay no mind what other voices say
They don't care about you, like I do (Like I do)
Safe from pain and truth and choice and other poison devils
See, they don't give a fuck about you, like I do

Just stay with me, safe and ignorant
Go back to sleep, go back to sleep
Lay your head down, child
I won't let the boogeyman come
Count the bodies like sheep
To the rhythm of the war drums
Pay no mind to the rabble
Pay no mind to the rabble
Head down, go to sleep
To the rhythm of the war drums

I'll be the one to protect you from
Your enemies and all your demons
I'll be the one to protect you from
A will to survive and a voice of reason
I'll be the one to protect you from
Your enemies and your choices son
They're one and the same, I must isolate you
Isolate and save you from yourself

Swaying to the rhythm
Of the new world order and
Counting bodies like sheep
To the rhythm of the war drums
The boogeymen are coming
The boogeymen are coming
Keep your head down, go to sleep
To the rhythm of the war drums

Stay with me, safe and ignorant
Just stay with me
Hold you and protect you from the other ones
The evil ones
Don't love you, son
Go back to sleep10Embed
