A Stranger LyricsCast the calming apple
Up and over satellites
To draw out the timid wild one
To convince you it's alright
And I listen for the whisper
Of your sweet insanity
While I formulate denials
Of your effect on me
You're a stranger
So what do I care?
You vanished today
Not the first time I hear
Or the last
What am I to do with all this silence?
Shy away, shy away phantom
Run away, terrified child
Won't you move away, you fucking tornado
I'm better off without you
Tearing my world down4Embed
