The Nurse Who Loved Me Lyrics
Say hello to the rug's topography
It holds quite a lot of interest, with your face down on it
Say hello to the shrinking in your head
You can't see it but you know it's there, so don't neglect it

I'm taking her home with me, all dressed in white
She's got everything I need, pharmacy keys
She's falling hard for me, I can see it in her eyes
She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys

Say hello to all the apples on the ground
They were once in your eyes, but you sneezed them out while sleeping
Say hello to everything you've left behind
It's even more a part of your life now that you can't touch it

I'm taking her home with me, all dressed in white
She's got everything I need, some pills in a little cup
She's falling hard for me, I can see it in her eyes
She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys

She's got everything I need, pharmacy keys
She acts just like a nurse with all the other guys
Say hello to the rug's topographyEmbed
