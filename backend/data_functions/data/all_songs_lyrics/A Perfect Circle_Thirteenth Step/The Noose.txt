The Noose Lyrics
So glad to see you well
Overcome them, completely silent now
With Heaven's help
You've cast your demons out

And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you off your cloud
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends
To the dead
To the dead

Recall the deeds as if they're all
Someone else's atrocious stories
Now you stand reborn before us all
So glad to see you well

And not to pull your halo down
Around your neck and tug you to the ground
But I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends
To the dead
To the dead
With your halo slipping down
Your halo slipping
Your halo slipping down
Your halo slipping down
Your halo slipping down

(With your halo slipping down)
And I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends

(With your halo slipping down)
And I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends

(With your halo slipping down)
And I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends

(With your halo slipping down)
And I'm more than just a little curious
How you're planning to go about making your amends
Your halo slipping down
Your halo slipping down
To choke you now15Embed
