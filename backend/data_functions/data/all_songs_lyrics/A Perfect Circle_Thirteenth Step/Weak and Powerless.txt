Weak and Powerless Lyrics
Tilling my own grave to keep me level
Jam another dragon down the hole
Digging to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren
One that pushes me along and leaves me so

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China White as Dracula as I approach the bottom

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you

Little angel go away, come again some other day
The devil has my ear today, I'll never hear a word you say
He promised I would find a little solace and some peace of mind
Whatever just as long as I don't feel so

Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Desperate and ravenous
So weak and powerless
Over you
Over you12Embed
