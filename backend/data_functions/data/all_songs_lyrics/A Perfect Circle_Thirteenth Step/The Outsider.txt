The Outsider Lyrics
Help me, if you can
It's just that this is not the way I'm wired
So, could you please help me understand why
You've given in to all these reckless dark desires?

You're lying to yourself again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, why would I wanna watch you?

Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your rush, now?
Everyone will have his day to die

Medicated drama queen
Picture perfect, numb belligerence
Narcissistic drama queen
Craving fame and all its decadence

Lying through your teeth again, suicidal imbecile
Think about it, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, why would I wanna watch you?
Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your rush, now?
Everyone will have his day to die

They were right about you
They were right about you

Lying to my face again, suicidal imbecile
Think about, you're pounding on a fault line
What'll it take to get it through to you, precious?
I'm over this, why do you wanna throw it away like this?
Such a mess, over this, over this

Disconnect and self-destruct
One bullet at a time
What's your hurry?
Everyone will have his day to die
If you choose to pull the trigger
Should your drama prove sincere
Do it somewhere far away from here4Embed
