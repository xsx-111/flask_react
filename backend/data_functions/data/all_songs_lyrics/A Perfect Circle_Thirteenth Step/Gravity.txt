Gravity Lyrics
Lost again, broken and weary
Unable to find my way
Tail in hand, dizzy, and clearly
Unable to just let this go

I am surrendering to gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live

I fell again, like a baby
Unable to stand on my own
Tail in hand, dizzy, and clearly
Unable to just let this go

High and surrendering to gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live, I choose to live, I choose to live
Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun
Help me survive the bottom

Calm these hands before they
Snare another pill and
Drive another nail down another needy hole
Please, release me
I am surrendering to gravity and the unknown
Catch me, heal me, lift me back up to the sun
I choose to live, I choose to live3Embed
