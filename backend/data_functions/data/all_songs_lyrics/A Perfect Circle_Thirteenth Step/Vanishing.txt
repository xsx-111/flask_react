Vanishing LyricsDisappear
Disappear
Higher
Higher
Into the air
Slowly disappear
No, no longer here
Disappear
Disappear
Thinner, thinner
Into the air
Never really here
Wasn't ever, ever
Like a thought brushing up against a sigh
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
Floating away
Vanishing like a
Sigh and slowly
Disappear
Disappear
Vanish
Vanish
Into the air
Slowly disappear
Never really here
(Floating away, floating away, floating away, floating away)3Embed
