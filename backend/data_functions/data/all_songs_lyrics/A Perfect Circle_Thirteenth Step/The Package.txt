The Package Lyrics
Clever got me this far
Then tricky got me in
Eye on what I'm after
I don't need another friend
Smile and drop the clich√©
'Til you think I'm listening
Take just what I came for
Then I'm out the door again

Peripheral on the package
Don't care to settle in
Time to feed the monster
I don't need another friend
Comfort is a mystery
Crawling out of my own skin
Just give me what I came for
Then I'm out the door again

Lie to get what I came for
Lie to get just what I need
Lie to get what I crave
Lie and smile to get what's mine
Eye on what I'm after
I don't need another friend
Nod and watch your lips move
If you need me to pretend
Because clever got me this far
Then tricky got me in
I'll take just what I came for
Then I'm out the door again

Lie to get what I came for
Lie to get what I need now
Lie to get what I'm craving
Lie and smile and get what's mine
Give this to me


Mine, mine, mine
Take what's mine
Mine, mine, mine
Take what's mine
(exhaling)
Lie to gain what I came for
Lie to gain what I need now
Lie to gain what I crave
Lie, just smile and get what's mine

Give this to me
Take what's mine
Mine, mine, mine
Take what's mine
Give this to me

Take what's mine
Take what's mine
Mine
Take what's mine
Take what's mine
Take what's mine
This is mine
Mine
