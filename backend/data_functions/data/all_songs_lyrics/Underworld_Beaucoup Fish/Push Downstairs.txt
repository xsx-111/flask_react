Push Downstairs Lyrics{It was coming out from Texas
 Texas
Maryland
Maybe Maryland, yeah
Yeah, I remember that now
I do remember that to record because}
Push, push, push
Tina, Tina, Tina
Tina lives in Berlin her voice so seldom
On my machine is here tonight
And I'm on the market
And when I'm on the market words move faster
Wire and clouds move thin between us
Like a skin, like a salty skin for a seed
A fat circles smiling, smiling
Her voice so intentionally
Smiling and a clouds between us
These are my intentions
These are my intentions
Pushin', pushin', pushin', push
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Kiss me, I see you, I've seen you before
I know about you I been told about you
You were waiting, and the wind's waiting for me to call
And you were waiting and the air where it's thin
Comin' through the tiny holes, your hunger
Comin' through the tiny holes, your finger
Comin' through the tiny holes and the edges of the night
And the tips of your wings are comin' through the tiny holes
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Pushin', push
These are my intentions
These are my intentions
 blonde's carrying something, is carrying me
And someone I used to be great plastic someone
Blue plastic girl, your dream is
Pushin', pushin' and pushin'
Pushin', pushin'
Push the way your body is
Pushin' , pushin' , pushin'
Push the way come me for the unbelieve, carry on song
Lipstick fodder, the boyfriend blonde
Between the holes of sheets
Is professionally poised faces watchin' her?
She's watchin' the faces watchin' her
These are my intentions
These are my intentions
Push, push, push
Tina, Tina
Push, push, push
Tina, Tina, TinaEmbed
