Push Upstairs LyricsTina lives in Berlin
Her voice so seldom
On my machine
Is here tonight
And I'm on the market
And when I'm on the market
Words move faster
Wire and clouds move
Thin between us
Like a skin
Like a salty skin
For a seed
A fat circles
Smilin', smilin'
Her voice so intentionally
Smilin'
And a cloud between us
And these are my intentions
Pushin', pushin', pushin', pushin'
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Push
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Good blonde
Is carryin' somethin'
Is carryin' me
And someone I used to be
Great plastic someone
Blue plastic girl
Your dream is
Pushin', pushin'
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Pushed away your body is
Pushin', pushin' ahh, pushin' ahh
Pushed away your
Come me for the unbelieve
Carry on song
Lipstick fodder
The boyfriend blond
Between the holes of sheets
Is professionally poised
Faces watchin' her
She's watchin' the faces
Watchin' her
Ah
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Push
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Love, love, love, love
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Love, love, love, love
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Ah
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Push
Pushin', pushin', pushin'
Love, love, love, love
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Love, love, love, love
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haEmbed
