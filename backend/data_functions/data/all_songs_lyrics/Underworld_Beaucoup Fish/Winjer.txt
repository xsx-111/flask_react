Winjer LyricsI'm having a whinge
A winjer today, today
I could be a diamond
I brought anything on a winjer
Having a whinge
Everything
Everything looks miserable
When you're the winjer
Opinions in the house of flame
When you're the winjer
I'm having a laugh
I'm having a laugh
With the roof off and the sunlit
Take your top off
Take your, take your top off
You look happy now
You look happy now
No spikes
Having a laugh
Warm grass around you
Warm grass around you
Warm grass around you
On a winjer
Today could be a diamond
I could be a diamond
About anything
Everything looks miserable
When you're the winjer
I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm having a laugh
With the roof off and the sunlit
Take your top off
Take your top off
Bird in the hall moonlight
Follows the road
Warm grass around you
Warm grass around youEmbed
