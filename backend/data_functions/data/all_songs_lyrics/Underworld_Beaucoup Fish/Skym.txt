Skym LyricsHmm, hmm
Do you still feed the animal?
Animal finger
Finger on the phone
Curve around corners
Do you still feed the animal?
Your muffled voices
Is there up beside you
And the wires coming
Open us
Close us
(Slide beneath the city)
Slide beneath the city
And the feet in the streets above us
And your voice again
(Your voice again)
(Your voice again)
I don't want you to call again

Do you still feed the animal?
Muffled madness
Quiet calm pervade her
I couldn't go through this again
You say you love her
You know you love her
You never want to be without her
You say you never want hurt her
You know you hurt her
(I)
How many lives you lives?
(I)
How many hurts you've done?
(I)
How many times you come to this place?
How much you want it?
You say you love herEmbed
