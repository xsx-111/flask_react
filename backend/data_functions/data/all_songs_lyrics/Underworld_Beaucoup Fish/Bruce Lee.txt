Skin hard sails in jail
Hair always cut with a blunt tool
Muscular but thin like springs
But not steel
For Ford men
Four Ford men
They sell it into vaporizing rulers
Each way up in his own head
Hold up in its fly flicking markses
Piggy little piggy little eyes
Holds and scape
Just enough to let in light
Bullet got the wrong bloke
But he don't die anyway
Its nothing mortal if you don't move
You still have slot the wall in a blanket
I have been this way for days
Bullet got the wrong bloke
It's happened mortuary, you die it means
Skin has it off the wall and it goes like this
I have been this way for days
Oh no, there's a gun
Over there under the bed
Turn, let's see what's in the other room
He grew up faster
Just the disco with the one get my rope
Pull through again
A third rat a fourth to his head is calm the sheets of calm
Bullet got the wrong bloke
He's out of the eyes now
Strained gas on his head
It's dark, he comes up with his darkness
