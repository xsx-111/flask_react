Snake fighting, it's very scary fighting
Snake, very dangerous
So is very po popular
At midnight everybody dancing on street, here
Everyone with same identity
Down their sake
Sake is very strong
Like a vodka, very dangerous
So everyone get a rolled
Up new newspaper
Setting on fire
And put it in between
Snake fighting life
Strong food and strong drink at midnightEmbed
