Most Anything You Want LyricsMost anything that you want, girl, is all right by me
Most anything that you want, girl, is all right by me
Girl 'cause, I just wanna make you happy
That's all I'm trying to do
Yes, I just wanna make you happy
And spend my lifetime with you
Most anything that you want, girl, is all right by me
Most anything that you want, girl, is all right by me
Girl 'cause, I just wanna make you happy
That's all I'm trying to do
Yes, I just wanna make you happy
And spend my lifetime with you
Most anything that you want, girl, is all right by me
Most anything that you want, girl, is all right by me
Girl 'cause, I just wanna make you happy
That's all I'm trying to do
Yes, I just wanna make you happy
And spend my lifetime with youEmbed
