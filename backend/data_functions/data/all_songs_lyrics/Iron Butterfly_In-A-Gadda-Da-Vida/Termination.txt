Termination LyricsFly blue sky, voices keep calling
Bidding me welcome
Why maiden land
Luring me closer, forbidden land
And as I'm Standing closer
Those natives step beyond
Release the mortal patterns
My mind I post beyond
Spinning in circles
Miracles happen
As lower life shows me in to my doom
Spirits be stricken
The end will come soon
This is termination
The outcome of your life...Embed
