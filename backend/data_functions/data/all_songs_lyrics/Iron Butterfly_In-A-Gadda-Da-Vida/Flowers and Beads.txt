Flowers and Beads Lyrics
Girl, I just know I love ya now

Flowers and beads are one thing
But havin' a girl is something
That's if you got a girl who loves you
And thinks the whole wide world of you

Flowers and beads are one thing
But havin' you, girl, that's somethin'
That's 'cause I know you love me only
And that you'll never leave my heart lonely

(Girl, he just knows he loves you now)
You're all I talk about and ev'rything I say and
Girl, I just know I love you now
Girl, I love you, I love you and need you in my lifetime

Girl, I just know I love ya
Don't you think my love is true?
Girl, I just know I want ya
Don't you think my love is true?
Flowers and beads are one thing
But havin' a girl is somethin'
That's if you got a girl who loves you
And thinks the whole wide world of you

Flowers and beads are one thing
But havin' you girl that's somethin'
That's 'cause I know you love me only
And that you'll never leave my heart lonely

(Girl, he just knows he loves you now)
You're all I talk about and ev'rything I say and
Girl, I just know I love you now
Girl, I love you, I love you and need you in my lifetime

Girl, I just know I love ya
Don't you think my love is true?
Girl, I just know I want ya
Don't you think my love is true?

Girl, I just know I want ya
Don't you think (Don't you think) that my (his) love is true?Embed
