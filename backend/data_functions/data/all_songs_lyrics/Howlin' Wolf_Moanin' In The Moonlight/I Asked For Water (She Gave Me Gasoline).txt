I Asked For Water (She Gave Me Gasoline) LyricsOh ho, I asked her for water, oh ho, she brought me gasoline
Oh ho, I asked her for water, oh ho, she brought me gasoline
That's the troubling woman that I ever seen
Oh ho, the church bell tollin', oh ho, the hearse come driving slow
Oh ho, the church bell tollin', oh ho, the hearse come driving slow
I hope my baby, don't leave me no more
Oh ho, tell me baby, oh ho, when are you coming back home?
Oh ho, tell me baby, oh ho, when are you coming back home?
You know I love you, baby, but you've been gone too longEmbed
