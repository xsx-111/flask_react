Pledging My Time Lyrics
Well, early in the morning
'Til late at night
I got a poison headache
But I feel alright

I’m pledgin' my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Well, the hobo got too high
And he came to me naturally
He stole my baby
Then he wanted to steal me

And I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Won’t you come with me, baby?
I’ll take you where you want to go
And if it don’t work out
You’ll be the first to know
I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Well, the room is so stuffy
I can hardly breathe
Everybody's gone, but me and you
And I can’t be the last to leave

I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Well they sent for the ambulance
And one was sent
Somebody got lucky
But it was an accident

I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too1Embed
