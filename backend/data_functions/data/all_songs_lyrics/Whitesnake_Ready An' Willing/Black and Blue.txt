Black and Blue LyricsYou never call me, babe until your man is gone
I know it's you when I pick up the telephone
You ask me how I am and if I'm doin' well
When all you want from me is just to ring your bell
Take your time, we can do some lines 'cos it's alright
We can feel fine, drinkin' midnight wine 'cos it's alright
Black and blue, black and blue
I said come over here, baby
And love me till I'm black and blue
You got the key to love dressed in your innocent smile
You know you touched me baby, babe
So won't you stay for a while?
And take your time, we can do some lines 'cos it's alright
We can feel fine, drinkin' midnight wine 'cos it's alright
Black and blue, black and blue
I said come over here, baby
And love me till I'm black and blue
Black and blue, hey baby, black and blue
I said come over here, baby
And love me till I'm black and blue
Take your time, we can do some lines 'cos it's alright
We can feel fine drinking midnight wine 'cos it's alright
Black and blue, black and blue
I said come over here, baby
And love me till I'm black and blue
Black and blue, baby, black and blue
I said come over here, baby
And love me till I'm black and blue
Oh yeah, I said come over here, baby
And love me till I'm black and blue
Black and blue, black and blue, black and blue
Black and blue, I'm talkin' 'bout me and you, baby
Black and blue, black and blue, baby, baby, black and blue
You come over here baby, babe until I'm black and blueEmbed
