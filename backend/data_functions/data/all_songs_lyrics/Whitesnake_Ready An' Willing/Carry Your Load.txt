Carry Your Load LyricsSaid, I take what I want and I got my eye on you
It's late in the evening, what are you gonna do
I got the place, if you got the time
I got the motion, baby, if you got the mind
So wise man tell me what it means to give and take
It's double trouble, but it can ease a little heartache
So you can carry your load down the long, winding road
Carry your load, down the long winding road
All I'm asking, all I wanna do is just
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
Said I know what I want and it's close to the bone
Sooner or later, baby, I'll be taking you home
You got the cool, but, you give me the heat
You got the music, baby, but, you give me the beat
So wise man tell me what it means to give and take
It's double trouble, but, it can ease a little heartache
So you can carry your load down the long, winding road
Carry your load down the long, winding road
All I'm asking, all I wanna do is just
Put a little love in your heart
Wise man tell me what it means to give and take
It's double trouble, but, it can ease a little heartache
So you can carry your load down the long, winding road
Carry your load down the long, winding road
You got to carry your load down the long, winding road
Carry your load down the long, winding road
Carry your load down the long, winding road
Carry your load down the long, winding road
Carry your load down the long, winding road
