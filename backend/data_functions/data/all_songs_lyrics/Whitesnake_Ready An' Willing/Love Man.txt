Love Man LyricsI've spent close on sixteen years
Watching your pretty flower grow
Little girl, little girl, now tell me
Everything you know
About the oceans and the skies
The mountains and the trees
And then I'm gonna tell you about
The birds and the honey bees
I'm a love man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a love man
I'm a hootchie cootchie man
And I'm doing all I can
I just love to tease
I would do anything to please you baby
Yeah, yeah
Sweet little angel, give me your hand
Feel for my heartbeat baby
Then you'll understand
About the bees and the honey
The bluebirds in the trees
And you know just to get close to you
I would get down on my knees
I am a love man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I am a love man
That's what I am
I'm a hootchie cootchie man
And I'm doing all I can
I could love to squeeze
I would do anything to please you baby
Baby, I am a love man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I am a love man
That's what I am
I'm a hootchie cootchie man
Doing all I can
I just love to tease
I would get down on my knees
Oh yeah
Just for you baby
Alright now, take it down
So come a little closer
Let me whisper in your ear
How the good Lord in his wisdom
Made you so and put you here
He played a little game
Called the apple and the snake
When the lady took her first sweet bite
The snake made no mistake
He was a love man
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And I am a love man
I'm a hootchie cootchie man
And I'm doing all I can
'Cause a love man needs his loving everyday
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I am a love manEmbed
