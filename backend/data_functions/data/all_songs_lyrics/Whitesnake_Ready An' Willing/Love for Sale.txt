Love for Sale LyricsI've never had a home, sweet, home life
And I don't want a nine-to-five
All the women I know think they can tie me down
But I will never let them take me alive
Take me home, you red light angel
I heard the boys mention your name
They say you got love for sale, love for sale
Then we going to love, love, love
I will lay my money down
Now some women say they don't want nothing
But a sweet-talking bull of a man
Said I've heard it before, I can't hear it no more
'Cause they all take whatever they can
So take me home, you red light angel
And whisper sweet nothings to me
I heard you got love for sale, love for sale
Then we going to love, love, love
I will lay my money down
I will lay my money down
Take me home, you red light angel
You come home with me
One thing we both got it coming
You know there ain't nothing for free
Talking about love for sale, love for sale
Then we going to love, love, love
I will lay my money down
I've known a lot of women in my time
And there was something I could never understand
Why a woman falls in love in the first place
And tries to change you to another kind of man
Take me home, you red light angel
You got no claim on me
Once you got love for sale, love for sale
Then we going to love, love, love
And I will lay my money down
Babe, I'm talking about love for sale, love for sale
Then we going to love, love, love
Talking about love, love, love
Then we going to love, love, love
And I will lay my money downEmbed
