Train in Vain Lyrics
They say you stand by your man
Tell me something I don't understand
You said you loved me and that's a fact
And then you left me said you felt trapped
Well, somethings you can explain away
But the heartache's with me till this day

Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way

All the times that we were close
I remember these things the most
I've seen all my dreams come tumblin' down
I can't be happy without you around
So alone I keep the wolves at bay
And there's only one thing I can say

You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be?
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me?
No, not at all

Now I got a job but it don't pay
I need new clothes I need somewhere to stay
But without all of these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through
Without your love I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do

You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
You didn't stand by me
No, not at all
You didn't stand by me
No way
You must explain
Why this must be?
Did you lie
When you spoke to me?

Did you stand by me?
No way
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
Did you stand by me
No, not at allEmbed
