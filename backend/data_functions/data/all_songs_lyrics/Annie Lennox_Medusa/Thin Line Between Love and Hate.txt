Thin Line Between Love and Hate LyricsYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And you just getting in
A knock upon the door
A voice sweet and low says
"Who is it?"
She opens up the door
And she lets you in
And never once does she say
"Where have you been?"
She says "Hold it
Are you hungry?
Did you eat yet?
Let me hang up your coat now."
And all the time she's smiling
Never raises her voice
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And you don't give it a second thought
It's a thin line between love and hate
It's a thin line between love and hate
The sweetest woman in the world
Can be the meanest woman in the world
If you make her be that way
She might be holdin' something in
That's really gonna hurt you
One of these fine days
There you are in a hospital
Bandaged from foot to head
In a state of shock
That much from being dead
You didn't think your woman
Could do something like that to you
Didn't think she got the nerve
Accidents speak louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
C'mon
C'mon baby baby
You don't give a damn about me
C'mon baby baby
You don't really care about me
C'mon baby baby
You dont give a damn about me
C'mon baby baby
You dont really care about me
C'mon baby baby
You dont give a damn about me
C'mon baby baby
You dont really care about me
Hear what I say
Hear what I sayEmbed
