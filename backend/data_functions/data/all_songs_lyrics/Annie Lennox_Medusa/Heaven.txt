Heaven Lyrics(CHORUS)
Heaven - is the whole of the heart
And heaven - don't tear you apart
Yeah heaven - is the whole of the heart
And heaven - don't tear you apart
There's too many kings
Wanna hold you down
And a world at the window gone underground
There's a hole in the sky
Where the sun don't shine
And clock on the wall
And it counts my time
(CHORUS)
There's a song on the air
With a love-you line
And a face in the glass
And it looks like mine
And I'm standing on ice when I say
That i don't hear planes
And i scream at the fools
Wanna jump my train
(CHORUS)Embed
