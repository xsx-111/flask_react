Downtown Lights Lyrics
Sometimes I walk away
When all I really wanna do
Is love and hold you right
There is just one thing I can say
Nobody loves you this way
It's all right, can't you see?
The downtown lights

In love we're all the same
We're walking down an empty street
And with nobody calling on me
Empty street, empty night
The downtown lights

How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know it's true?
It's all right

Tonight and every night
Let's go walking down this empty street
Let's walk in the cool evening night
Wrong or right
Be at my side
The downtown lights
It will be all right
It will be all right
The downtown lights
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it
How do I know it's true?
It's all right
It's all right
The downtown lights
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it
How do I know it's true?
The downtown lights

Neons and cigarettes
The rented rows and rented cars
The crowded streets, the empty bars
Chimneytops, the trumpets
The golden lights, the loving prayers
Colored shoes,the empty trains
I'm tired of crying on the stairs
The downtown lights
