My Little Empire Lyrics
My little empire
Has risen and it's set
My little empire
Is as good as it can get
My little empire
Is coming around
My little empire
It don't make a sound

My royalty it does not exist
It is extinct for the eye to see
My ideology it is dead and gone
Almost forgotten for the eye to see

My little empire
I'm sick of being sick
My little empire
I'm tired of being tired
My little empire
I'm bored of being bored
My little empire
I'm happy being sad
All of my sins are attempts to fill the voids
All of my voids they are filled with sin
All of my demons they are kept within
And all my violence it does not exist

My little empire
I'm happy being sad
My little empire
I'm fucked with being fucked
My little empire
I'm done with being dumb
My little empire
I'm happy being sad

Happy being sad
Happy being sad
Happy being sadEmbed
