Montana/Autumn/78 LyricsLuddite lover
Forgiving father
Unhappy forever
Live it to where you can
Those skies must drive you wild
The earth around you
This silence around you
Be with the sky tonight
You've ruined more than you'll gain
Know what you mean - but not what you do
Nature will take care of itself
Your ego will destroy itself
Montana/Autumn/78
Your life into the future
Maybe forty years
A life worth saving or lonesome ever more
The nothingness of truth
Or everlasting youth
Ideology or the ultimate thrill
You've ruined more than you'll gain
Know what you mean - but not what you do
Nature will take care of itself
Your ego will destroy itself
