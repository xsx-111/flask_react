Valley Boy Lyrics
Here I am in Amsterdam
I like it here they speak my language
Even though it's not my own
It's got bbc for comfort zone
And best of all, it's got Marks and spencers
Equality for the masses never felt better

Some of my dreams, they may have come true
But so have my nightmares which I can't get through

And now i've lost the power to speak
And now i've lost the power to eat
Idle and out of touch in Europe
Nothing's gone and nothing's changed
All that was before will still remain
It's too late to learn a new currency
