Tsunami Lyrics
For you, my dear sister
Holding onto me forever
Disco dancing with the rapists
Your only crime is silence
Can't work at this anymore
Can't move, I wanna stay at home
Tied up to all these crutches
Never far from your hands

Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Can't speak
Can't think
Won't talk
Won't walk

Doctors tell me that I'm cynical
I tell them that it must be chemical
So, what am I doing girl?
Cry into my drink, I disappear
Eyes for teeth grating over me
Bring down the shadows of my mind
Sleep and breathe under our sheets
Inhale the anxiety in between
In between
In between
In between
Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Through September, under the weather

In between
In between
In between
In between

Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Tsunami, tsunami
Came washing over me
Take the G.I.s, I will have the spies1Embed
