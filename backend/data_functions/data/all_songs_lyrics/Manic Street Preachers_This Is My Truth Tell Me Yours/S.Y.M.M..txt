S.Y.M.M. Lyrics
The subtext of this song
I've thought about it for so long
But it's really not the sort of thing
That people want to hear us sing
The context of this song
Well I could go on and on
But it's still unfashionable
To believe in principles

South, South Yorkshire
Mass murderer
How can you sleep at night?
Sleep at night?
South, South Yorkshire
Mass murderer
How can you sleep at night?
Sleep at night?

The reason for this song
Well maybe it's a pointless one
But thank you Jimmy McGovern
For reminding me of what lives on
The ending for this song
Well I haven't really thought of one
There's nothing I could ever say
That could really take the pain away

South, South Yorkshire
Mass murderer
How can you sleep at night?
Sleep at night?
South, South Yorkshire
Mass murderer
How can you sleep at night?
Sleep at night?Embed
