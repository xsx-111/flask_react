Be Natural Lyrics
Been natural
For once in my life
Now I'll have to swallow some pride
Know that I should never give advice
But it's too late now to say goodbye

Be natural
Don't want any friends
Be natural
Come on and hit me again
Be natural
I'm repeating myself
Be natural
Is there anything else

Starbright keep me safe
Today and tonight
No water tastes like lemonade
Slowly slowly it starts to fade

Be natural
With me tonight
Be natural
Put your fists in my eyes
Be natural
So turn me to stone
Be natural
Just leave me alone
Grown up or backwards born
Into eternity and black holes
Floating around up here on my own
Screaming at me forever unknown

Been natural
Been natural
Been natural
Been natural
Is there anyone elseEmbed
