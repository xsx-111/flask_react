You Stole the Sun from My Heart Lyrics
Drinking - water to stay thin
Or is it to purify
I love you all the same
But there's no - no real truce with my fury
You don't have to believe me
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

You have - broken through my armour
And I don't have an answer
I love you all the same
I paint - the things I want to see
But it don't come easy
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from
Think I'm - I'm lost among the undergrowth
So much so I woke up
I love you all the same

But you stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from my
You stole the sun from my heart
You stole the sun from
You stole the sun from

I have - I've got to stop smiling
It gives the wrong impression
I love you all the same1Embed
