Ready for Drowning Lyrics
Here's a true story said someone to me yesterday
Said he'd heard it in a taxi
Must have had him at my mercy
Drown that poor thing
Put it out of its misery
Condemn it to its future
Deny its history
Deny its history

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

Look through my Venetian blinds
Dusting the past off of my mind
Seeing orange everywhere
I'd go to Patagonia
But it's harder there
I'll do anything to prove I care
Fascinated by good
Destroyed by evil
What is there to believe in
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning

I will bring the whole edifice
Down on their unworthy heads

So where are we going
We're not ready for drowning
So where are we going
We are not waving we're drowning1Embed
