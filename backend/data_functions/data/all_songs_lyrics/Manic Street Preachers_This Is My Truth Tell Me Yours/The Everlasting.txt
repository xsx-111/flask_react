The Everlasting Lyrics
The gap that grows between our lives
The gap our parents never had
Stop those thoughts control your mind
Replace the things that you despise
Oh you're old I hear you say
It doesn't mean that I don't care
I don't believe in it anymore
Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
But now unforgiven, the everlasting
Everlasting

The world is full of refugees
They're just like you and just like me
But as people we have a choice
To end the void with all its force
So don't forget or don't pretend
It's all the same now in the end
It was set in a different life
Destroys my days and haunts my nights
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
But now unforgiven, the everlasting
Everlasting
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
But now unforgiven, the everlasting
Everlasting
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuine
In the beginning when we were winning
When our smiles were genuineEmbed
