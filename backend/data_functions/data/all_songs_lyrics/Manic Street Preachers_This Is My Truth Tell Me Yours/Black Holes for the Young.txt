Black Holes for the Young LyricsLots of sun for you, young boy
Lots of sun for you today
Subsidise the opera, forget coal
Sit around in the London smog
Cappuccinos amongst the fumes
I breathe it in, then down the gym
Yes, I'm on a witch hunt now
And paracetamol my only drug
You've got some black holes for the young
You won't feel it when it's gone
You've got some black holes for the young
You won't know when it's gone, when it's gone
No sun for you, young boy
It will hurt your lily-white skin
I don't think it will hurt your mind
We'll be the ones who will give you soul
Close enough to fill all those holes
This tenderness slipping through my fingers
Sandy, sandy feet - ice cream to sleep
And no more feeling that you can feel
You've got some black holes for the young
You won't feel it when it's gone
You've got some black holes for the young
You won't know when it's gone
When it's gone (When it's gone, gone)
When it's gone (When it's gone, gone)
When it's gone (When it's gone, gone)
When it's gone (When it's gone, gone)
When it's gone (When it's gone, gone)
Gone (When it's gone, gone)
You've got some black holes for the young
You won't feel it when it's gone
You've got some black holes for the young
You won't know when it's gone, when it's goneEmbed
