Buildings for Dead People LyricsWe build buildings for the dead
We build restrooms for the sick
We build up walls for everything
We make a wall for the sake of it
And buildings for the people
And paintings for the blind
Capable of giving life
Or taking out your eyes
And buildings for the people
And paintings for the blind
Capable of giving life
Or taking out your eyes
Queue for bread is entertainment
When they're trying to blow your head off
So from the womb into the tomb
Making sure you feel at home
And buildings for the people
And paintings for the blind
Capable of giving life
Or taking out your eyes
And buildings for the people
And paintings for the blind
Capable of giving life
Or taking out your eyes
History will make us or history will break us
All time is the same ......
......
...... eh? Suggestions please
Get ready to say goodbye
Get ready to say goodbyeEmbed
