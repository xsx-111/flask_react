My Little Brother LyricsMy little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
There's a noise in his head, and he's out of control
And yes it frustrates
Let's let him make his own mistakes
See him on the dance floor go now
Boy those moves I just don't know how
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
He's only 22 and he's out of control
How's he living?
With all of that unforgiving
See him on the dance floor go now
Boy those moves I just don't know how
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
There's a noise in his head and he's out of control
He no longer listens to A-sides
He made me a tape of bootlegs and B-sides
And every song, every single song on that tape
Says exactly the same thing
Why don't our parents worry about us?
Why don't our parents worry about us?
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
My little brother just discovered Rock & Roll
Stay off the Crack!Embed
