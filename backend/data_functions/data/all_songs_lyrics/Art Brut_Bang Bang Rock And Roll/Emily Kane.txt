Emily Kane LyricsI was your boyfriend when we were fifteen
It's the happiest that I've ever been
Even though we didn't understand
How to do much more than just hold hands
There's so much about you I miss
The clumsy way we used to kiss
I wish I convinced you, you've made a mistake
If memory serves, we're still on a break
Other girls went and other girls came
I can't get over my old flame
I'm still in love with Emily Kane
Every girl that I've seen since
Looks just like you when I squint
I know you said it's for the best
I still don't understand why you left
So much about you I miss
Everytime I see a couple kiss
I hope this song finds you fame
I want school kids on buses singing your name
Other girls went and other girls came
I can't get over my old flame
I'm still in love with Emily Kane
I don't even know where she lives
I've not seen her in ten years
Nine months, three weeks, four days
Six hours, thirteen minutes, five seconds
Other girls went and other girls came
I can't get over my old flame
All my friends think I'm insane
I'm still in love with Emily Kane
There's a beast in my soul that can't be tamed
I'm still in love with Emily Kane
I thought I'd never love again
I'm still in love with Emily Kane
The torch that I hold, is always a-flame
I'm still in love with Emily Kane
I hope this song finds you fame
I want school kids on buses singing your name
All my friends think I'm insane
I'm still in love with Emily Kane
Emily Kane, Emily Kane, Emily Kane!Embed
