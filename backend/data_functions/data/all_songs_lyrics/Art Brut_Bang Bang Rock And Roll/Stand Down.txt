Stand Down LyricsI thought my resolve was too hard to be broken
It's easy to pretend that you were just joking
There's no need to see plans through to fruition
Especially if, you've guessed the conclusion
Some of us want to go back to our families, stand down with Enrique Gatti
Some of us want to go back to our families, stand down with Enrique Gatti
A right to advise, advice for the wise, there's no shame in, Giving in
I'm delighted to have found
If it's too heavy, you can, just put it down
The bravest decision, you ever make
Is admitting that, you made a mistake
Some of us want to go back to our families, stand down with Enrique Gatti
Some of us want to go back to our families, stand down with Enrique Gatti
A right to advise, advice if you're wise, there's no shame in, Giving in
Stand down, stand down, stand down, stand down
It's not a lack of determination, it's more heroic resignation
Some of us want to go back to our families, stand down with Enrique Gatti
Some of us want to go back to our families, stand down with Enrique Gatti
I've no right to advise, advice if you're wise, there's no shame in, Giving upEmbed
