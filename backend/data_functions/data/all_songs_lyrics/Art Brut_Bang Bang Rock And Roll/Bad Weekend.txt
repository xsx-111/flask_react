Bad Weekend LyricsHaven't read the NME in so long
Don't know what genre we belong
Haven't read the NME in so long
Don't know what genre we belong
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to me
It's tough at the top
The fashionista
Text in Topshop
Text in Topshop
Sometimes it's hard to stop
When your heart is set on Top of the Pops
Top of the Pops
Haven't read the NME in so long
Don't know what genre we belong
Haven't read the NME in so long
Don't know what genre we belong
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to me
It's tough at the top
The fashionista
Text in Topshop
Text in Topshop
Sometimes it's hard to stop
When your heart is set on Top of the Pops
Top of the Pops
I've saved up so much money to spend
All I could afford is a bad weekend
And there's no reason to stay in
There's nothing on the television
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to me
Popular culture no longer applies to meEmbed
