Yeah, we've got guns, but they're antiques
They're rusted and they're broken
The Red Brigade made us give our bomb back
But we're going to do this bank job
And we're gonna do our very best

Enrique's got a head cold again
It's not his fault
He's a brave and valiant leader
He couldn't even get bus passes this time
Just scooters, very fast scooters
18,000 Lira
18,000 Lira
18,000 Lira
18,000 Lira
Sounds like a lot of moneyEmbed
