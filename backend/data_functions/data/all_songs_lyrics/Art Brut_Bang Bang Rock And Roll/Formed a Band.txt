Formed a Band Lyrics
Formed a band, we formed a band
Look at us, we formed a band 

Honey pie, I don't know when it started
Stop buying your albums from the supermarket
They only sell records that have charted
And Art Brut, we've only just started
And yes, this is my singing voice
It's not irony, it's not rock and roll
We're just talking, to the kids


We're gonna be the band that writes the song
That makes Israel and Palestine get along
We're gonna write a song as universal as Happy Birthday
That makes sure everybody knows that
Everything is going to be okay
We're going to take that song
And we're going to play it
Eight weeks in a row on Top of the Pops

Dye your hair black, never look back
My past is my businessEmbed
