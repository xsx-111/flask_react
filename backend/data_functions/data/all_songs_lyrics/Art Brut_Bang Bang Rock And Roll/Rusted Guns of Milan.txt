Rusted Guns of Milan LyricsI know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
It doesn't mean that I don't love you, one more try with me above you
It's got nothing to do with anything I've had to drink
It's more to do with the way I think
Leave the light on, leave the light on, leave the light on for me
Leave the light on, leave the light on, leave the light on for me
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I know I can
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, can I get you a cup of coffee?
Don't tell your friends, don't tell your friends, I promise it won't ever happen again
Leave the light on, leave the light on, leave the light on for me
It's frustrating for you, well it's frustrating for me
You're lying there and you're beautiful
You're beautiful and of course I want to, why wouldn't I?
It doesn't mean, I don't love you, one more try with me above you
Leave the light on, leave the light on, leave the light on for me
It's nothing to do with anything I've had to drink
There's something wrong with the way I think
I know I can, I know I can
I'm fine when I am with my own hand
Never use my Rusted gun of MilanEmbed
