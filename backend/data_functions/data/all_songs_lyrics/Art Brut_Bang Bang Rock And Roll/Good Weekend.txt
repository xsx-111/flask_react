Good Weekend LyricsFirst time I saw her
I wanted to do more than just hold her
I wanted to bend her and fold her
So I lent over and I told her
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
So many messages to send
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
We want to be lapsed catholics
Got the contraception, haven't got the knack yet
We've tried it a variety of ways
I've not sleeped in about four days
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
Phone's ringing all weekend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
So many messages to send
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
So we went to the cinema
We came home from the cinema
We went through the front door
Up the stairs
Through her bedroom door
Onto the bedroom floor
I've seen her naked twice!
I've seen her naked twice!
Brand new girlfriend
Brand new girlfriend
Brand new girlfriend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
So many messages to send
Phones ringing all weekend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
Got myself a brand new girlfriend
And I think that I love herEmbed
