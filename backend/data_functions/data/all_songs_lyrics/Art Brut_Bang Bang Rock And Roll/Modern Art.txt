Modern Art LyricsModern art
Makes me
Want to rock out
(x4)
So I'm in the Tate
And I'm looking at Hockney
And oh sweet Jesus
There's something about that blue
It touches me deep inside
Amazes me when I step outside
I'm sweating
I'm sweating
I'm beginning to palpitate
I can't help myself
I just can't help myself
Modern art
Makes me
Want to rock out
(x4)
So I'm in the Pompidou
In Paris
And they're more laid back about their art galleries
There's little children running around
I see a piece by Matisse
Take three steps back
Take a long run up
And I jump at it!
Modern art
Makes me
Want to rock out
