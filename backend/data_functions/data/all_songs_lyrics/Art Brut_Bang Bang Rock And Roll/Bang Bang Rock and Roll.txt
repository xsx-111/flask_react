Bang Bang Rock and Roll LyricsBang, bang, Rock and Roll
Bang, bang, Rock and Roll
Bang, bang, Rock and Roll
I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground
(White Light, White Heat)
I can't stand that sound the second time around
(White Light, White Heat)
Met the sweetest girl, sold me a pill
Tasted like shit and it made me feel ill
Watch my body, twist and jerk
I just wanna find a drug that works
Bang, bang, Rock and Roll
Bang, bang, Rock and Roll
Bang, bang, Rock and Roll
I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground
(White Light, White Heat)
I can't stand that sound the second time around
(White Light, White Heat)
I don't want a girl that's with the band
I just want a girl that's gonna hold my hand
No more songs about sex and drugs and Rock and Roll
It's boring
Bang, bang, Rock and Roll
Bang, bang, Rock and Roll
Bang, bang, Rock and Roll
I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground
(White Light, White Heat)
I can't stand that sound the second time around
(White Light, White Heat)
Once is enough
(White Light, White Heat)
Once is enough
(White Light, White Heat)
Once is enough
(White Light, White Heat)Embed
