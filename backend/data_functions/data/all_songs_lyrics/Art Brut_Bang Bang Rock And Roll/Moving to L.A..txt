Moving to L.A. LyricsThere's not much glam about the English weather
There's nothing left keeping us together
Sunshine on a rainy day
Makes me wanna move away
I think I've got it sorted
I'm going to get myself deported
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
Hang around with Axl Rose
Buy myself some brand new clothes
Everything is gonna be just fine
I hear the murder rate is in decline
I'll do me some relaxing
Maybe grab a piece of action
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
When I get off the plane, the first thing I'm gonna do is
Strip naked to the waist and ride my Harley Davidson
Up and down Sunset Street, I might even get a tattoo
My problems are never gonna find me
I'm not sending one letter or even a postcard back
I'm drinking Hennessey with Morrissey
On a beach, out of reach, somewhere very far away
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
I'm considering a move to LA
He's considering a move to LA
