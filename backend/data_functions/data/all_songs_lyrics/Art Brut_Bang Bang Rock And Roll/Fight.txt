Fight LyricsStorm brewing for a long time, don't think that I can't read the danger signs
What's the matter, nothing, what's the matter, nothing
Some people like things left unspoken, I prefer to have it out in the open
Some people like things left unspoken, I don't care if you shout it, get it out in the open
Come on, come on lets have a fight
Come on, come on lets have a fight
Come on, come on lets have a fight
Come on, come on, come on…
The nights ending, we've both had a fair few, I'm being stopped getting anywhere near you
Whispering, doing my head in, yeah there's friends between us but I'm not listening
I've overheard of a coupla clenched fists, a few more drinks and it comes to the surface
What's the matter, what? nothing, what's the matter, nothing
Some people like things left unspoken, I prefer to have it out in the open
Some people like things left unspoken, I don't care if you shout it, get it out in the open
Come on, come on lets have a fight
Come on, come on lets have a fight tonight
Come on, come on lets have a fight
Come on, come on, come on…
What's that? I'll 'ave him, slaughter him, what? He's a bit bigger, but he's drunker isn't he? When he's not looking…honestly let's keep it outside… I'm not joking…
Some people like things left unspoken, I prefer to have it out in the open
Some people like things left unspoken, I don't care if you shout it, get it out in the open
Come on, come on lets have a fight
Come on, come on lets have a fight
Come on, come on lets have a fight
Come on, come on, come on…
OI! come on! Fight!Embed
