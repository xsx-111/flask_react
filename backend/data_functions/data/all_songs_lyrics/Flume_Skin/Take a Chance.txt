Take a Chance Lyrics
So you feel all your powers unfold
Stretching your big wings over waters turning gold
So tell your story, baby, don’t give up
Just let all it go out, the quiet wishing’s not loud enough

Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts
Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts, will you...?

You could break up clouds with your fist in the air
We're singing out loud as we march up the square
He always goes to put you in your place
And now you're chanting out loud so you can't be erased

Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts
Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts, will you...?

Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts
Will you be the one to take a chance?
Have demands, spill your heart
Will you be the one to take a stand
Make the girls dance
Spill your thoughts, will you...?10Embed
