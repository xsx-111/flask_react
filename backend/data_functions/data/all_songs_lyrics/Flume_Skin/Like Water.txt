Like Water Lyrics
Melt into me
We go like water
We go like water
Bleed, we all bleed
We go like water
We go like water
Gift everything
We go like water
We go like water

All night
Close my eyes, can’t sleep
Cry tonight
Give me life, rain down on me
All I need, all I need
All I need, all I need
You’re all I need, all I need
You're all I need, all I need

All I need, all I need
All I need, all I need
You’re all I need, all I need
You’re all I need, you’re all I need4Embed
