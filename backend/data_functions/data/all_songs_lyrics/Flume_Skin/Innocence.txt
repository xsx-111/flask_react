Innocence Lyrics
When you hold me
All your innocence, something broken

All your innocence when you hold me, you hold me
All your innocence, something broken, broken
All your innocence when you hold me, you hold me
All your innocence, something broken, broken
All your innocence when you hold me, you hold me
All your innocence, something broken, broken
All your innocence...

(Yes, yes, yes, don't stop, stop, stop...)
When you hold me
All your innocence, something broken, broken
All your innocence when you hold me
(Yes, yes, yes, yes....)
All your innocence, something broken
All your innocence....
(Yes, yes, yes, yes....)

Begin again, begin again
How do we begin again?
Start again, start again
How do we make it all a game?
Begin again, begin again
How do we begin again?
Start again, start again
How do we make it all a game?
How do we erase
And how do we evade
(Something broken, broken)
(All your innocence)
How do we erase
And how do we evade
(Something broken, broken)
(All your innocence)

All we want is a chance to give ourselves
Our way, our way
(All your innocence)
All we want is a chance to give ourselves
Our way, our way
(All your innocence)
Broken
Your innocence already broken, baby
So much broken
Your innocence already broken, baby
Your innocence already broken
Your innocence already broken, baby
So much broken
Your innocence already broken, baby
Your innocence already broken8Embed
