Tiny Cities Lyrics
Can I, should I, find my way home?
Now did I, think I better go home?
All I said I needed was gone
But I thought I heard it all wrong
Now can it ever be a safe place?
When they never seem to forget
So it hurted more than you said
Burn it down inside of your head

Oh, she is following me in my head when I am all alone
(Why can't I go down into her world?)
Thinking of her every time I want to try to let her go
But it's never easy when you think you have it in control
Somehow you get caught up in the moment and you never know
All these tiny cities that you're holding in your little hand
(Why can't I go down into her world?)
Glittering like diamond lights that blow away in desert sand
It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last

It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last
It was never perfect and was never meant to last

Why can't I go down into her world? (Gotta get it, right, right)
Why can't I go down into her world? (Gotta get it, right, right)

Can I ever get ahead of what I want and what I need
And what do I have to do to get away from what is killing me?
How can I convince myself to not believe in what I know
When all I see is dominoes falling uphill as we go?

(As we, as we go, go, go, go, go, go)
(As we, as we go, go, go, go, go, go)
(As we, as we go, go, go, go, go, go)
(As we, as we go, go, go, go, go, go)
(As we, as we go, go, go, go, go, go)
(As we, as we go, go, go, go, go, go)
(As we, as we go, go, go, go, go, go)
(As we, as we go, go, go, go, go, go)

Why can't I go down into her world?
Why can't I go down into her world?7Embed
