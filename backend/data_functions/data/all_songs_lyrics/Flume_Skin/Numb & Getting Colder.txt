Numb & Getting Colder Lyrics
It's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
It's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
It's alright (It's alright, it's alright)

Make your decisions now, weigh it up
Facing a long road down or keeping your head above
Saying the same thing twice won’t make it right
Held up in your desires, but

Maybe we're looking for a different way
Does it matter when you act like this?
Yeah, you got into something
Let it take control of you, oh
'Cause you say it but you won’t admit it, oh
Numb and getting colder, physical existence disappears

Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
It's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
It's alright (It's alright, it's alright)

Not gonna tell you stop, ease it up
Hold your emotions back, stop taking it out on her
I'm gonna lose no pride, giving up
We're going on lockdown

Maybe we're looking for a different way
Does it matter when you act like this?
Yeah, you got into something
Let it take control of you, oh
'Cause you say it but you won’t admit it, oh
Numb and getting colder, physical existence disappears

Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
It's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
It's alright (It's alright, it's alright)

If I feel like losing my mind
We're into deeper
Feelings often we leave behind
I'm too weak from this
Sometimes to get something refined
And trust your instincts
Broken, don’t do one thing, survive
So primitively

Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you
Said you begged to leave
I won’t be behind you
And I can’t breathe, breathe
I won’t be behind you9Embed
