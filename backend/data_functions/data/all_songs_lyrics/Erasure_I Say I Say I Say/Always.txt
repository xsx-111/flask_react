Always Lyrics
Open your eyes; I see
Your eyes are open
Wear no disguise for me
Come into the open

When it's cold outside
Am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night
There will be no shame

(Always) I wanna be with you
And make believe with you
And live in harmony, harmony
O love
(Always) I wanna be with you
And make believe with you
And live in harmony, harmony
O love
(Always)

Melting the ice for me
Jump into the ocean
Hold back the tide; I see
Your love in motion
When it's cold
(When it's cold)
Outside
(Outside)
Am I here in vain?
Hold on to the night
There will be no shame

(Always) I wanna be with you
And make believe with you
(Always)
And live in harmony, harmony
O love
(Always) I wanna be with you (always)
And make believe with you (always)
And live in harmony, harmony
O love

When it's cold
(When it's cold)
Outside
(Outside)
Am I here
In vain?
(When it's cold )
Hold on

To the night

There will be no shame

(Always) I wanna be with you

And live in harmony, harmony

O love
