I Love Saturday LyricsIf they'd ever told me
That I'd find true love in every way
Would I cry 'till tomorrow
Would I keep the non-believers away
Remember that late night last September
When you held me in your arms so tight?
I was feeling kind of low my heart was blue
I was empty till you came
But oh what a.....
Saturday night
Things were going right
As right as they'd ever be
I know that you love me
If they'd ever told me
That I'd find true love in every way
Would I cry till tomorrow?
Would I keep the non-believers away?
Was I shy was I good with
This foolish heart?
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?
Like a knight in shining armor you came over
To save me what a bolt out of the blue
Just one look into those eyes
You had me fallin' completely (Head over heels in love with you)
But oh what a.....
Saturday night
Things were going right (I love Saturday)
As right as they'd ever been
I know that you love me
If they'd ever told me (If they'd ever told me)
That I'd find true love in every way (Way-ay)
Would I cry till tomorrow? (Would I cry till tomorrow?)
Would I keep the non-believers away?
(Would I keep the non-believers away?)
Was I shy was I good with
This foolish heart? (Was I shy? Was I good?)
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?
And you saw me
I was falling
Head over heels in love with you
Saturday night
Things were going right (I love Saturday)
As right as they'd ever be
I know that you love me
If they'd ever told me (If they'd ever told me)
That I'd find true love in every way (Way-ay)
Would I cry till tomorrow? (Would I cry till tomorrow?)
Would I keep the non-believers away?
(Would I keep the non-believers away?)
Was I shy was I good with
This foolish heart? (Was I shy? Was I good?)
Did I try to deny we would fall? (I love Saturday)
If they'd ever told me (If they'd ever told me)
That I'd find true love in every way (Way-ay)
Would I cry till tomorrow? (Would I cry till tomorrow?)
Would I keep the non-believers away?
(Would I keep the non-believers away?)
Was I shy was I good with
This foolish heart? (Was I shy? Was I good?)
Did I try to deny we would fall?
Did I try to deny we would fall-ah?
Did I try to deny we would fall apart?Embed
