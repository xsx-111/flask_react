So The Story Goes LyricsI close my eyes
To the sound of the sky and I see
Birds in the trees in pastures green
Nothing to do
With the time or the place I perceive
The rush of the sea beneath my feet
Such a lovely world
Oh so magical
Precious like a pearl
Wrapped up in a shell
Build your house of stone
On a bed of sand
Time and tide will rise
Washing through your hands
Hear your heart
See the love
Feel the soul lift up
Hear your heart
See the love
Feel the soul lift up
I lift my eyes
To the sound in the sky and I hear it
A voice on the breeze is so serene
Nothing to do
With the time or the place but I feel it
Like dust on the moon beneath my feet
Such a lovely world
Oh so magical
So the story goes
Sing the madrigal
What a lovely world
Waxing lyrical
See the lies unfold
Hear the miracle
So the story goes...
The lies and the miracle unfold
Fresh like a pearl
Wrapped in a shell
Build your house of stone on a bed of sand
Time and tide will rise
To wash tru' your hands
Feel your soul lift up
Hear your heart, see the love
Feel your soul lift up
I lift my eyes to the sound in the sky
And I hear it
A voice in the breeze, so sereneEmbed
