Man In The Moon LyricsStories from the deepest
Part of my heart
Delving under cause to wonder
Why am I falling apart?
Scattered all around
This topsy turvy room
Will I find the one
Who takes me there too soon?
When the night is cold
And you can't find anything
And your will to survive's
At an all-time low
The spirit will fly and return
With a newfound energy
So keep it within and delight
As your garden grows
Whispered in some lonesome voice
Too afraid to come out of the dark
Sinking down into the covers
Sleep to the beat of your heart
Spinning all around
This most peculiar room
Will I find the one
Who takes me there too soon?
Do be kind and civilized
And don't descend into the dark abyss
When the night is cold
And you can't find anything (There's nothing there to be found)
And your will to survive's
At an all-time low (The moon is shining)
The spirit will fly and return
With a newfound energy (Give your heart like a __?)
So keep it within and delight
As your garden grows
Do be kind and civilized
And don't descend into the dark abyss
When the night is cold
And you can't find anything (There's nothing there to be found)
And your will to survive's
At an all-time low (The moon is shining)
The spirit will fly and return
With a newfound energy (Give your heart like a __?)
So keep it within and delight
As your garden grows
And the man up in the moon is shining
Good fortune down on me
And the man up in the moon is shining
Sweet love
Sweet loveEmbed
