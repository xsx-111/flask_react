Blues Away Lyrics
Can you see this predilection
Rushing through my head
Was a morning full of circumstance
I was seeing red
Put my blues away

Navigation gone astray
Went any way I could
Haven't got the time of day
Cannot see why I should
Put my blues away

I can hope
I can pray
Until you
Find me
Someday

Always had my reservations
Who am I to blame
Walked into the ring of fire
Heart in a wall of flames
Put my blues away
My emotion running riot
Through the neighbourhood
Screaming in the dead of night
I wish to be understood
Put my blues away

I can hope
I can pray (I can pray)
Until you
Find me
Someday (Until you find me someday)

I can hope
I can pray (I can pray)
Until you
Find me
Someday (Until you find me someday)


Navigation gone astray
Went any way I could
Haven't got the time of day
Cannot see why I should
Put my blues away
I can hope
I can pray (I can pray)
Until you
Find me
Someday (Until you find me someday)
I can hope
I can pray (I can pray)
Until you
Find me
Someday (Until you find me someday)

Tell me where you are
Little darling
'Cause I ain't got 20/20 vision
And I know you're here somewhere
And it's nearly bedtime
I'm getting lonely
Ooh little darling
Tell me where you are
'Cause I ain't got 20/20 vision
And I know you're here, here somewhere
And it's nearly bedtime
And I'm getting lonelyEmbed
