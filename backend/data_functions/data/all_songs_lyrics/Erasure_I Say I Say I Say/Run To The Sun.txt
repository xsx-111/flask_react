Run To The Sun LyricsRun to the sun
For the first time in my life
I'm up to run away
It's not a choice that I made easily
It's not that I'm ashamed
To face the light of day
It's really just a case of self delusion
And I know it ain't easy
I know it ain't easy
I know it ain't easy
To see the truth
So run to the sun
Here's one for the road
And may God's love go with you
My tears are starting to show
Woah...
( Run to the sun, and may God's love go with you )
( I cry my tears, who will be my hero )
That I should fall from grace
Implies a twist of fate
But I'm open to the joys and woes of passion
And who shall take the wheel
When it's time for overkill
There's no release when destiny is calling
And I know it ain't easy (I know it ain't easy)
And I know it ain't easy (Somebody reach me)
And I know it ain't easy (Willing to teach me)
To see the truth
So run to the sun
Here's one for the road
And may God's love go with you
My tears are starting to show
Woah...
So run to the sun
Here's one for the road
You know I'll never be lonely
Are you so high above me?
Woah...
(Run to the sun, see how my life is changing)
(The days go by, I wonder if I'll make it)
Run to the sun
Run to the sun
And I know it ain't easy (I know it ain't easy)
Somebody reach me (Somebody reach me)
Willing to teach me (Willing to teach me)
So run to the sun
Heres one for the road
And may God's love go with you
My tears are starting to show
Woah
( Run to the sun, and may God's love go with you )
( I cry my tears, who will be my hero )
So run to the sun
Heres one for the road
You know I'll never be lonely
Are you so high above me?
(Run to the sun, see how my life is changing)
(The days go by, I wonder if I'll make it)
So run to the sun
Heres one for the road (I'm running I'm running I'm running Days go by)
And may God's love go with you
My tears are starting to show (I'm running I'm running I'm running I cry my tears)
Woah
So run to the sun
Heres one for the road (I'm running I'm running I'm running Days go by)
You know I'll never be lonely
Are you so high above me? (I'm running I'm running I'm running I cry my tears)Embed
