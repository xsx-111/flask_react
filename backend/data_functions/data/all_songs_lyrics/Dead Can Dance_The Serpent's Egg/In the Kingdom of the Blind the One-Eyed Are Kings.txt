In the Kingdom of the Blind the One-Eyed Are Kings LyricsIf it were within, within our power
Beyond the reach of slavish pride
To no longer harbour grievances
Behind the masked opportunist's facade
We could welcome the responsibility
Like a long-lost friend
And re-establish laughter
In the dolls' house once again
For a time has imprisoned us
In the order of our years
In the discipline of our ways
And in the passing of momentary stillness
We can see our chaos in motion
Our chaos in motion
We can see our chaos in motion
View our chaos in motion1Embed
