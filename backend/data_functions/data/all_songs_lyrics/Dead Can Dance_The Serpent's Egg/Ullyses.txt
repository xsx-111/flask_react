Ullyses LyricsJohn Francis Dooley
Wipe the sleep from your eyes
And embrace the light
You have slept now
For a thousand years
Beneath starless nights
And now it's time for you
To renounce the old ways
And see a new dawn rise
In former days
Masks were raised
When the god came down
From off of the mountain
And the sacrifice was made
For he knew the day of wrath
Was fast approaching
Just like yesterday before the war
John Francis Dooley
The scapegoat has run
All our sins are disowned
And now it's time for you
To take off your mask
And cross the Rubicon
If you and I were one
Within the eyes of our designs
It would still not change
The fact of our leaving
For tonight we must leave
With the first gentle breeze
For the Isles Of Ken
We are assailing
Just like Ullyses
On an open sea
On an odyssey
Of self discovery1Embed
