Rose Quartz Turning to Glass LyricsFade
From the shade that you see
Every morning, every noon
It's the color of this room
Even with your eye unclear
There's some king of azure dust on your pillow
Clouds
Are painted on in difference
A worn signpost for your dreamflight
It's all about atmosphere
There's some king of azure dust on your pillow
My secluded focus on trading shapes
My elusive purpose holds its hiding place
Drowsy missive underneath the painted May
I missed the room change colorEmbed
