Baby Turns Blue LyricsMary be so proud, things that aren't allowed
To take your own life, stab it with a knife
They put you in a box, send you up to heaven, heaven
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
Give me money, give me sex
Give me food and cigarettes
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
(What should we do if baby turns blue)
You broke my heart, it came in two
The faculties of a broken heart
I go out on Monday, looking for a Tuesday
Nothing ever makes much sense
You don't seem to make much sense
Shooting out in someone's dream
Shooting out in something else
It was an accident, I didn't mean it
It was an accident, I didn't mean it
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
(What should we do if baby turns blue?)
John had a bomb and he lit it in his head
Went to bed for seventeen weeks
Took too many drugs, now he don't eat
They put you in a box and send you up to heaven, heaven
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
Give me money, give me sex
Give me food and cigarettes
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
Oh what to do, not to feel and who are you?
What should we do if baby turns blue?Embed
