Decline And Fall LyricsSee the children play by
Running try to touch the sky
When one falls you hear a cry
“You’re dead, you’re dead, you must die”
“Take a dream and fly away”
Take a dream and fly away” she will call
They will wait for you not I
They will wait for you not I, see me crawl
And sometimes I feel so old
I never smile nor do cry
Shadows flicker from above
“Seeker save your soul” she said
“Seeker save your soul” she said
She will fly, she will fly
He will wait far away
A golden key to open the door
Behind which the answer lies
You sinned in dreams
Now awake in deeper, deeper dreams
“Take a dream and fly away
Take a dream and fly away” she will call
They won’t wait for you not I
They will wait for you not I, see me crawl
She will fly, she will fly
Far away, far away
Decline and fall…
Never return…
Die…
Die…Embed
