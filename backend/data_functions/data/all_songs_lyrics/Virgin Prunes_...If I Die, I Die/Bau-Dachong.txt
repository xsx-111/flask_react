Bau-Dachong LyricsOf this men shall never know
Of this men shall never understand
I close my eyes so I cannot, cannot see
So afraid of the dark, there's nothing there
There's nothing there
You're mad, you're mad, you're a weirdo
You've gone too far, to far, too soon
Breaking out from the inside
I'll wait for you, so hard to find, so hard, so hard to find
Take closer steps, three steps to nothing
The clothes I wear are burnt
There's only smoke in the field
If I die I die
If I die I die
We will wait for, we will wake up
We will, we will be one
This black heart, this black heart
This black heart is so cold
Of this men shall never know
Of this men shall never understand
Take the monkey from my back
Pointing out, pointing out my enemy
I'm looking for something I can see
Something, something, something I can touch
I look for the boy with
The boy with the stars in his eyes, in his eyes, in his eyes
We will wait for, we will wake up
We will, we will be one
We will wait for, we will wake up
We will, we will be one
We will wait for, we will wake up
We will, we will be oneEmbed
