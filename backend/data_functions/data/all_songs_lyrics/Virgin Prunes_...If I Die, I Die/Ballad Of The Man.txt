Ballad Of The Man LyricsOnce I was rich but I'm better off with a satisfied mind
I go down to the river, see the boats go sailing down
I throw stones in the river, it keeps me satisfied, satisfied
I live day by day, take every day as it comes
Some are good and some are bad
Spanish Johnny came in from the underworld last night
Looking for a gang to rob a bank
Looking for some easy money
He said "Do you wanna join my gang"
I said "You must be joking"
Spanish Johnny got caught
And went to jail to be a nice fellow for a long time
I just live from day to day
Knowing I'm better off than a bank-robber
I believe, I believe in you
I'm better off as I amEmbed
