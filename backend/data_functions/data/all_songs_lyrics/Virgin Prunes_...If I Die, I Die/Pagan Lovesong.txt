Pagan Lovesong LyricsHeathen a pagan
No sun shines for me
Savage but gentle
The animal within
And I see it now
I had a weird dream
Watch but donâ€™t touch
I had a weird dream
I'm taking it away
"Put it in a bag, hide it in a tree"
I want to steal your heart, your heart
With these eyes I cannot see
And this cold heart never bleeds, never
Sweet smell this poison, the colour you bring
Tongue swollen venoms, to touch... to love
I want to steal your heart
I want to eat your heart
I reach for the sky but never can touch
It seems so easy, easy to me
Still I cannot, will not take this thing
Hearsay, this heresy
A victim to sin
Eternal the torment, the answer lies within
I had a weird dream watch but don't touch
I had a weird dream I'm taking it away
"The love you give is the love you get..."1Embed
