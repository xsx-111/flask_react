Walls Of Jericho LyricsWhich the way, the way we are going?
Which the way will save us all?
For I have been here for so long
For I have seen all i can see
I see further to a day, to a day never to come
With eyes in the back of my head
I see all around me
I didn't know him for I didn't see
To live once again, to live in dreams
To live once again, to live once again
The walls of Jericho
To walk on water, speak with fire
To live once again
I watched a man, a man he died
Nailed to a cross, nailed to a cross
He believes he can see the walls of JerichoEmbed
