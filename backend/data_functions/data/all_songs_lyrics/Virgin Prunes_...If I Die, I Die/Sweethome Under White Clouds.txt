Sweethome Under White Clouds LyricsSweethome under white clouds
A picture on the wall
It says it all, it says it all
I had a dream long time ago, imaginary
Like water, I had no colour
Running free, eternal beauty
And heaven, it was on earth
The promised land of milk and honey
And I see it now
The pain it lasts and all is wasted
Sweethome, sweethome
Under white, white clouds
And we, we slept happily ever after
We, we slept happily ever after
Sweethome, sweethome
Under white, white clouds
Home is where the heart is
Home is where the heart is
And we, we slept happily ever after
We, we slept happily ever after
(Home is where the heart is)
Sweethome
Under white, under white clouds
(Home is where the heart is)
Sweethome
Under white, under white clouds
(Home is where the heart is)
Sweethome
Under white, under white clouds
(Home is where the heart is)Embed
