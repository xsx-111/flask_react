Marble Focus Lyrics
Did you know before this morning
Come eleven you'd be soaring?

You should have waved to us
As you scaled Stonehenge
Saw your marble focus
As you mounted the wind

What use is the orange to me
If you siphon all the goody?

You should have waved to us
As you scaled Stonehenge
Saw your marble focus
As you mounted the windEmbed
