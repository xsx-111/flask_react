Righteous Woman Lyrics
I am not a righteous woman
I'm more of an ass man
And when I go to spread, it's just to
Take up all the space I can
You notice
You know this

Next time you're in the city
Should you decide to call me
Just know that I am dealing
With a flesh that's far too willing

I am not a righteous woman
I'm more of an ass man
And when I go to spread, I'm only
Squinting out a strip to land
From my panopticon
From my panopticon

Next time you're in the city
Should you decide to call me
Remember that I am dealing
With a flesh that's far too willing
To do anything
That you wanted to
To call it home in you
To call it home in you

Next time you're in the city
Should you decide to call me
Remember that I am dealing
With a flesh that's far too willing
Next time you're in the city
Should you decide to call me
Remember that I am dealing
With a flesh that's far too willingEmbed
