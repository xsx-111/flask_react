Greener Stretch Lyrics
Camped out in your sinking house
Coulda gone bowling
I saw you cherry-picking ashes
You shoulda told me

Though there was no mention of a slanted kitchen
I'll just tilt my vision to see it all better
It can't be over yet
There must be a greener stretch ahead

Now that we have groped the ledge
Let's step back from it!
I'll spend all the time that's left
In my new velvet

Though there was no mention of a slanted kitchen
I'll just tilt my vision to see it all better
Don't tell me it's over yet
Gotta be a greener stretch aheadEmbed
