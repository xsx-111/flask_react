To Be Given a Body LyricsWhere would I have been if
Not safe in the middle
Pressed between
His right shoulder
Your left shoulder
Drowsy on the ski lift
Drowsy on the ski lift
To be given a body
Is the greatest gift
Though the jar lifts and the jar descends
Though the morning glory withers
Before it begins
Though all creation groans
Every Sunday morning
He'd wake me with a whistle
Rolled me in a sheet
I swung towards you
I swung towards him
Laugh till I can't breathe
Laugh till I can't breathe
To be given a body
Is the greatest gift
Though the jar lifts and the jar descends
Though the morning glory withers
Before it begins
Though all creation groansEmbed
