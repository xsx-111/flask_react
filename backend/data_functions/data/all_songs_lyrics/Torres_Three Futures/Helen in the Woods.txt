Helen in the Woods Lyrics
Never spoke a single lie
Still no one believes your side
You were bored and too polite
And Helen had you in her sights

You come home from school
To find her naked in your bed
Everybody always said
Helen's funny in the head

Threw her class ring
To the voices in the trees
Keep an eye out good
Cause Helen's in the woods

Her Mama proved a hitch to pose
So Helen broke her Mama's nose
Your Dad said "Son, what'd you do to that girl?
Something's gone and made her whiskers curl"

You come home from school
To find her naked in your bed
Everybody always said
Helen's funny in the head
Threw her class ring
To the voices in the trees
Warn the neighbors if you could
Tell 'em Helen's in the woods

Helen, Helen
Come out, come out, wherever you are
Helen, Helen
Come out, come out, wherever you are

You come home from school
To find her naked in your bed
Everybody always said
Helen's funny in the head

Threw her dignity
To the voices in the trees
I'd leave the neighborhood
Cause Helen's in the woods1Embed
