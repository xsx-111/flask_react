Skim Lyrics
Consider the source of your energy
Do you just hate him more than you love me?
Never been this sore for alkalinity

There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
I'm only the skim of
What has already been
I know every tense in
Which I cannot exist yet
My head swivels at one-ways
My head swivels at one-ways

Can you probe the ends of the Almighty?
Did he hold your hips with authority?
No pride or projection swells like insecurity
If only I could use that to hold you
I tell you, I would use that to hold you

There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
I'm only the skim of
What has already been
I know every tense in
Which I cannot exist
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in
There's no unlit corner of the room I'm in1Embed
