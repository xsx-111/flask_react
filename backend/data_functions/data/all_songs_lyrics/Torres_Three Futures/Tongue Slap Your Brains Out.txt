Tongue Slap Your Brains Out LyricsKnowing you were laundry-
Folding just outside the
Bedroom door, I slept near it
Knowing you would carry
Half the hapless buzzing
Of my dilated spirit

I know you never dreamed
I'd become a damn Yankee
I need you to believe
That I'm still your same baby

No feeling like finding
A peach cobbler sunning
Belly-up on the granite
The kind that'll make your
Tongue slap all your brains out

I know you never dreamed
I'd become a damn Yankee
I need you to believe
That I'm still your same baby
I know you never dreamed
I'd become a damn Yankee
If you could only see
It's still the Georgia winds that move meEmbed
