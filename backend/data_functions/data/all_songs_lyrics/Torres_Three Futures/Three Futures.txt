Three Futures LyricsI got hard
In your car
In the parking lot
Of the Masonic lodge
We lined the Hudson with our tangents
You trusted me to love your parents
Sunk into my tunnel vision
Sunk into my tunnel vision
I hope that's what you'll remember
Not how I left, but how I entered
You didn't know I saw three futures
One alone, and one with you
And one with the love I knew I'd choose
You got me loaded
On bergamot perfume
Downstairs in
The TV room
You laid the plans
And I was quiet
My eyes
A trinity divided
My eyes
A trinity divided
I hope what you will remember
Is not how I left, but how I entered
And not the hope that I abused
If remembering's something you do
You didn't know I saw three futures
You didn't know I saw three futures
One alone, and one with you
And one with the love I knew I'd chooseEmbed
