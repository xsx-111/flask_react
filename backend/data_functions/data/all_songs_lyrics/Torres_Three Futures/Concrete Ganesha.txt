Concrete Ganesha Lyrics
I saw someone posted up
Under the Myrtle viaduct
A concrete Ganesha, winking
Knower of beginnings
I've got to wonder
What it is you're seeing
That I can't see from here

Cause I busted my guts
On the Myrtle viaduct
And those guts are nobody's now
Love lit us Cadillac green
My love is patient with me
Late-twenties-skinny
In your sweater

Knower of beginnings
I've got a hunger
For whatever you're seeing
That I can't see from here
Cause I lined up my ducks
Along the Myrtle viaduct
And those ducks are nobody's now
You moved like a sunroom
Bracing for Sunday evening
Auburn curls hanging
From a mind made up

Knower of beginnings
I think I know now
What it is you're seeing

Turns out my baby's had enough
Of the Myrtle viaduct
And the city is knocking it down
My baby is nobody's nowEmbed
