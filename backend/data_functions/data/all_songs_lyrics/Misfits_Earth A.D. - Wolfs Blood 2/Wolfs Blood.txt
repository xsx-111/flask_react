Wolfs Blood Lyrics
You don't know what I fucking am, what I become
Not when I get like this, you can never get me down in my head

My blood, it flows right fucking through my veins
I feel my vertebrae extending and I feel my heart expand
And I feel my muscles rip and I feel my snout extend
Then I know I'm not a man, and I go right out of my head
My blood, it swarms right fucking through my veins
That feeling starts boiling through my face, red
And I feel my heart expand and I feel my muscles rip
And I feel my snout expand, then I know I'm not a man

You don't know what I fucking am, what I become
You can never get me down, not when I get like this in my head

It's wolfs blood, it's pumping like it's fucking in my veins
I'm gonna get it up and I'm gonna break it up
And I'm gonna break his head with my arms

Oh, hey
Know why you're dead?Embed
