Be Prepared LyricsSPOKEN LIVE INTRODUCTION ON "REVISITED":
You know, of all the songs I have ever sung, that is the one
I've had the most requests not to. I have time for one more here. This one is a little song dedicated to the Boy Scouts of America. (applause) We seem to have a convention here tonight. The Boy Scouts of America, those noble little bastions of democracy, and the American Legion of tomorrow. Their motto is--I would like to state at this time that I am not now and have never been... a member of the Boy Scouts of America--their motto is, as you know, "Be Prepared," and that is the name of this song
SUNG:
Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' marching song
Be prepared! As through life you march along
Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well
Don't write naughty words on walls if you can't spell
Be prepared! To hide that pack of cigarettes
Don't make book if you cannot cover bets
Keep those reefers hidden where you're sure
That they will not be found
And be careful not to smoke them
When the scoutmaster's around
For he only will insist that it be shared
Be prepared!
Be prepared! That's the Boy Scouts' solemn creed
Be prepared! And be clean in word and deed
Don't solicit for your sister, that's not nice
Unless you get a good percentage of her price
Be prepared! And be careful not to do
Your good deeds when there's no one watching you
If you're looking for adventure of a
New and different kind
And you come across a Girl Scout who is
Similarly inclined
Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared
Be prepared!Embed
