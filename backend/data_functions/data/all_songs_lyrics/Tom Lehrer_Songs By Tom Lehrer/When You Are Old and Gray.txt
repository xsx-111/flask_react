When You Are Old and Gray LyricsSince I still appreciate you
Let's find love while we may
Because I know I'll hate you
When you are old and grey
So say you love me here and now
I'll make the most of that
Say you love and trust me
For I know you'll disgust me
When you're old and getting fat!
An awful debility
A lessened utility
A loss of mobility
Is a strong possibility
In all probability
I'll lose my virility
And you your fertility
And desirability
And this liability
Of total sterility
Will leed to hostility
And a sense of.. futility
So let's act with agility
While we still have facility
For we'll soon reach senility
And lose the ability
Your teeth will start to go dear
Your waist will start to spread
In twenty years or so dear
I'll wish that you were dead
I'll never love you then at all
The way I do today
So please remember
When I leave in December
I told you so in MayEmbed
