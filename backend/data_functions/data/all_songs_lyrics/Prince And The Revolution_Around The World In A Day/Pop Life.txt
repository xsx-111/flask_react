Pop Life Lyrics
What's the matter with your life
Is the poverty bringing you down?
Is the mailman jerking you 'round?
Did he put your million dollar check in someone else's box?

Tell me, what's the matter with your world
Was it a boy when you wanted a girl? (Boy when you wanted a girl)
Don't you know straight hair ain't got no curl (No curl)
Life it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Pop life, everybody needs a thrill
Pop life, we all got a space to fill
Pop life, everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop
Dig it

Tell me, what's that underneath your hair?
Is there anybody living there? (Anybody living there)
You can't get over, if you say you just don't care (Don't care)
Show me a boy who stays in school and I'll show you a boy aware
Dig it
Pop life, everybody needs a thrill
Pop life, we all got a space to fill
Pop life, everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop
Dig it

What you putting in your nose?
Is that where all your money goes? (Is that where your money goes?)
The river of addiction flows
You think it's hot, but there won't be no water when the fire blows
Dig it

Pop life, everybody needs a thrill
Pop life, we all got a space to fill
Pop life, everybody wants to be on top
But life it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop

Throw the bum out!

Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life, we all, we got a space to fill
Pop life, everybody can't be on top
But life it ain't real funky unless it's got that pop4Embed
