Tamborine Lyrics
Oh my God, here you are
Prettiest thing in life I've ever seen
Close my eyes, what's it like?
What's it like inside your tambourine?
Oh my God, there I go
Falling in love with the face in a magazine (uh oh, not again)
All alone by myself
Me and I play my tambourine

Tambourine
Tambourine
Tambourine
Tambourine
Long days, lonely nights
Tambourine
Long days, lonely nights
Tambourine

I don't care for one night stands
With trolley cars
That juggle seventeen
I just want to settle down and
Play around
My baby's tambourine
Tambourine what are you?
Why are you the star of all my dreams?
(Star of all my dreams, are you a good tambourine?)
Are you good? Are you bad?
Are you just unnecessary means?
Tambourine
Tambourine
Tambourine
Trolley cars

Long days, lonely nights
Too bad we're not allowed to scream (yeah, yeah, too bad)
Guess that I'll stay at home
All alone and play my tambourine (aww!)

Tambourine
Tambourine
Tambourine
Tambourine
TambourineEmbed
