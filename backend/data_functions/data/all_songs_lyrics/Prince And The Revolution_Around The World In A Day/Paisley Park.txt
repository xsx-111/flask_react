Paisley Park Lyrics
One, two
One, two, three
Woo! Hee-hee
Uh, uh, uh, uh

There is a park that is known for the face it attracts
Colorful people whose hair on one side is swept back
The smile on their faces, it speaks of profound inner peace
Ask where they're going, they'll tell you nowhere
They've taken a lifetime lease on Paisley Park
The girl on the seesaw is laughing
For love is the color this place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say you believe
And come to this place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

There is a woman who sits all alone by the pier
Her husband was naughty and caused his wife so many tears
He died without knowing forgiveness and now she is sad, so sad
Maybe she'll come to the park and forgive him
And life won't be so bad in Paisley Park
The girl on the seesaw is laughing
For love is the color this place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say you believe
And come to this place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

See the man cry as the city condemns where he lives
Memories die, but taxes he'll still have to give
(Who) Whoever said that elephants were stronger than mules?
Come to the park and play with us
There aren't any rules in Paisley Park

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
For love is the color this place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say you believe
And come to this place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart

The girl on the seesaw is laughing
For love is the color this place imparts (Paisley Park)
Admission is easy, just say you believe
And come to this place in your heart
Paisley Park is in your heart
Your heart, your heart
Paisley Park
Your heart, your heart, your heart (sing, sing it)
Paisley Park
