Condition of the Heart Lyrics
There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter to
Hoping she would answer back, now wasn't that a fool-
Hardy notion on the part of a sometimes lonely musician?
Acting out a whim is only good for a condition of the heart

There was a dame from London who insisted that he love her
Then left him for a real prince from Arabia, now isn't that a shame
That sometimes money buys you everything and nothing?
Love, it only seems to buy a terminal condition of the heart

Thinking about you driving me crazy
My friends all say it's just a phase, but ooh-ooh
Every day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard

There was a woman from the ghetto who made funny faces
Just like Clara Bow, how was I to know
That she would wear the same cologne as you
And giggle the same giggle that you do?
Whenever I would act a fool, the fool with a condition of the heart

Thinking about you driving me crazy
My friends all say it's just a phase, but ooh-ooh
Every single day is a yellow day
I'm blinded by the daisies in your yard
There was a girl (There was a girl in Paris)
Whom he sent a letter to (Whom he sent a letter to)
(Hoping she would answer back)
She never answered back and now (wasn't that a foolhardy)
He's got a condition of the heart1Embed
