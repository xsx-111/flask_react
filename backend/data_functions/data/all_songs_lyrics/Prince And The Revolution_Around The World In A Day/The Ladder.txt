The Ladder LyricsOnce upon a time in the land of Sin-a-plenty
There lived a king who didn't deserve to be
He knew not where he came from
Nor where he was going
He never once said thank you, never please
Now this king he had a subject named Electra
Who loved him with a passion uncontested
For him each day she had a smile
But it didn't matter
The king was looking for the ladder

Everybody's looking for the ladder
Everybody wants salvation of the soul
The steps you take are no easy road
But the reward is great
For those who want to go
A feeling of self-worth (everybody's looking)
Will caress you (for the answers)
The size of the whole wide world will decrease (how the story started)
(and how it will end)
The love of God's creation will undress you
And time spent alone my friend, will cease
Everybody's looking for the answers
How the story started and how it will end
What's the use in half a story, half a dream
You have to climb all of the steps in between
