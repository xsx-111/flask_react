Temptation Lyrics
Sex
Temptation
Lust
Pop, go mama

Everybody on this earth has got a vice
And mine, little darling, mine is the opposite of ice
Mine is the running hot water of the daughter of morality
In other words
This little Prince thinks a lot about you, see?
Baby, baby, baby
I'm guilty in the first degree

Temptation
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in the pool of splashing musk

Everybody in this room
Everybody in this room has got an urge
What's yours, baby?
Mine is temptation, it reigns at a party where lovers splurge
Pop go mama when daddy gets a little too much
You know what I'm talking about?
Purplectricity whenever our bodies touch
Oh baby, I love it when our bodies touch
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in a pool of splashing musk
Temptation
Temptation
Temptation
Wait a minute now
Working my body with a hot flash of animal lust
Temptation
All my fingers in a pool of splashing musk
Temptation
Working my body
Working my body
Working my body

Temptation
I'm not talking about just ordinary temptation, people
I'm talking about the kind of temptation that'll make you do things
Oh, oh, temptation
Oh, darling, I can almost taste the wetness between your
Temptation, temptation
I'm not talking about any old kind of temptation, people
I'm talking about
I'm talking about
Sexual temptation
A lover
I need a lover, a lover, I need a... right now
You, I want you
I want you in the worst way
I want you
Oh, silly man, that's not how it works
You have to want her for the right reasons
I do!
You don't, now die
No! No!
Let me go, let me go
I'm sorry
I'll be good
This time I promise
Love is more important than sex
Now I understand
I have to go now
I don't know when I'll return
Good-byeEmbed
