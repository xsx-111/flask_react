Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye Lyrics
Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million, a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss
Soften my dreams with your sigh
And after you've loved me for a million, a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

If you must go, baby, I won't grieve
But just wait a lifetime before you leave
Then if you must go I won't tеll you no
Just so that we can say we tried
Tеll me you love me for a million, a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbyeEmbed
