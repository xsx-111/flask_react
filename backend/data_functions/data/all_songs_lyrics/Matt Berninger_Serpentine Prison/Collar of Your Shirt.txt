Collar of Your Shirt Lyrics
One, two, three, four

You fall apart at easy gatherings
You're just a loner so just escape
I'll hold 'em off with long meandering strings
I'm always in, always in the way
I'm always in, always in the way

Your sparkle's all I will inherit
My love is in an outward spiral
I'll tell you everything whenever you want
In the vanishing geometry of fire
In the vanishing geometry of fire

There's a fabric to the low branches
I see the patterns in the dirt
The way I trickle off the ribbon when you blink
And fall into the collar of your shirt
And fall into the collar of your shirt
And fall into the collar of your shirt

I do not want to believe it
It's better off that I don't know
I'm so afraid your love is leaving me
Never tells me where it goes
And I can't hear myself down here
I hear no sounds
But everything is screaming out for you
When you're not around
But I can feel it getting closer
Like summer on the edges
Whenever I approach you
Your body language changes
I do not want to believe it
It's better off that I don't know
I'm so afraid your love is leaving me
Never tells me where it goes
And I can't hear myself down here
I can't hear no sounds
When everything is screaming out for you
When you're not around
But I can feel it getting closer
Like summer on the edges
Whenever I approach you
Your body language changesEmbed
