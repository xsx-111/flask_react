Serpentine Prison Lyrics
I see the starlight through the clouds
Why won't anybody listen to me?
Don't make me say it again out loud
Big Star are doing Don't Worry Baby
Bipolar pride, swim in the tide
Keep your deadhead above and your chin up
You're gonna have a pretty hard time
Without drugs, without love

Total submission, I've seen a vision
Everyone's screaming, I've been daydreaming
Sorry I'm fishing without permission
Tell her I'm missing in a serpentine prison

Don't try to connect the dots anymore
Let 'em go, they're gonna do it on their own
Tell me that I'm not in this alone
And I, I'm so sorry, I don't know why I'm slow
I feel like an impersonation of you
Or am I doing another version of you doing me?
Nobody's ever really thinking about us
Half as much as we want 'em to be
Total frustration, deterioration
Nationalism, another moon mission
Total submission, I've seen a vision
Call electrician, serpentine prison
Whatever it is I try not to listen
Cold cynicism and blind nihilism
I need a vacation from intoxication
Tell her I'm missing in a serpentine prison

I've been picking my kid up from school
Smelling like girl scout cookies and drool
I still crawl up to you every night
Do not forgive me, I'm a reptile
You say I'm a lot, I'm hard to take
I think you're just drinking the water
I walk into walls and I lay awake
I don't want to give it to my daughter

Total submission, I've seen a vision
Everyone's screaming, I've been daydreaming
Sorry I'm fishing without permission
Tell her I'm missing in a serpentine prison
Total frustration, deterioration
Nationalism, another moon mission
Total submission, I've seen a vision
Call electrician, serpentine prison

Whatever it is I try not to listen
Cold cynicism and blind nihilism
I need a vacation from intoxication
Tell her I'm missing in a serpentine prison
Total submission, I've seen a vision
Everyone's screaming, I've been daydreaming
Sorry I'm fishing without permission
Tell her I'm missing in a serpentine prisonEmbed
