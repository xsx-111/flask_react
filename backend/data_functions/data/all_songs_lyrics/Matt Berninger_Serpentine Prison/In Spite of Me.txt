In Spite of Me Lyrics
Last night I told a stranger all about you
They smiled patiently with disbelief
I always knew you would succeed no matter what you tried
And I know you did it all in spite of me

Still I'm proud to have known you for the short time that I did
Proud to have been a step up on your way
Proud to be a part of your illustrious careers
And I know you did it all in spite of me
In spite of me

Bridge
Late last night I saw you in my living room
You seemed so close but yet so cool
For a long time I thought that you'd be coming back to me
Those kind of thoughts can be so cruel
So cruel

And I know you did it all in spite of me
In spite of me
In spite of me
In spite of meEmbed
