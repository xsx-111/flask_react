My Eyes Are T-Shirts Lyrics
My eyes are T-shirts, they're so easy to read
I wear 'em for you but they're all about me
They always say "I want you to take me home"
They always say "I want you to leave me alone"
My tongue's a bible in the drawer of a desk
Leave it alone please, give it a rest
You walk in the room like a blade in a cutter
Some things, baby, are made for each other

When I see you something sad goes missing
I stop crying, lay down and listen
I hear your voice and my heart falls together
Please come back, baby, make me feel better

My mind's a flashlight, flickering out
The wires are fussy, the batteries are out
My breath is an ocean that suddenly stops
When you walk in the room, the temperature drops

When I see you something sad goes missing
I stop crying, lay down and listen
I hear your voice and my heart falls together
Please come back, baby, make me feel better
Please come back, baby, make me feel better
Please come back, baby, make me feel betterEmbed
