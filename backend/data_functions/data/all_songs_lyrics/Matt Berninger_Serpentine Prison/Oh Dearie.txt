Oh Dearie Lyrics
I'm aiming lower
House turned over
Haven't talked to no one
I don't know in how long

Oh, dearie
Don't get near me
Paralysis has me

I am near the bottom
Name the blues, I got 'em
I don't see no brightness
I'm kinda startin' to like this

Oh, dearie
Don't get near me
Paralysis has me

How do people do it?
I cannot see through it
Bootstraps are in the basement
Guess I'll use my laces
Oh, dearie
Don't get near me
Oh, dearie
Paralysis has me

I am near the bottom
Name the blues, I got 'em
I don't see no brightness
I'm kind of starting to like thisEmbed
