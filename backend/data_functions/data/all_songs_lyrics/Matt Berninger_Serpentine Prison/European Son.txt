European Son LyricsYou killed your European son
You spit on those under twenty-one
But now your blue cars are gone
You better say so long
Hey, hey, hey, bye, bye, bye
You made your wallpapers green
You wanna make love to the scene
Your European son is gone
You'd better say so long
Your clowns bid you goodbye
You killed your European son
You spit on those under twenty-one
And now your blue cars are gone
You better say so long
Hey, hey, hey, bye, bye, bye
You made your wallpapers green
You wanna make love to the scene
Your European son is gone
You'd better say so long
Your clowns bid you goodbye
You killed your European son
You spit on those under twenty-one
But now your blue cars are gone
You better say so long
Hey, hey, hey, bye, bye, bye
You made your wallpapers green
You want to make love to the scene
Your European son is gone
You'd better say so long
Your clowns bid you goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Hey, hey, hey, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Hey, hey, hey, bye, bye, bye
Hey, hey, bye, bye
Hey, hey, bye, bye
Hey, hey, hey, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Hey, hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye
Hey, hey, hey
Bye, bye, bye
I think that's the most I've played in a yearEmbed
