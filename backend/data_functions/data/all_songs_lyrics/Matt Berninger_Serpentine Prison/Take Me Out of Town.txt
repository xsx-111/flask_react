Take Me Out of Town Lyrics
Where are you?
You said you'd be here by now
You said you'd be here any minute
Swear to God
I've never been so burned out
Gonna lose it any minute

Wake me
Take me out of town to the end
Of any road that you wanna go down
Make me
Make me listen all the way
To the end of any road

Yes, I know
Everyone's in this alone
We gotta leave here any minute
Swear to God
Is this how you thought it'd turn out?
Gonna losе me any minute

Wake mе
Take me out of town to the end
Of any road that you wanna go down
Make me
Make me listen all the way
To the end of any road
Because I don't know how to be here without you
I don't know how to go on
Because I don't know how to be here without you
I don't know how to go on

Where are you?
You said you'd be here by now
You said you'd be here any minute
Swear to God
I've never been so burned out
Gonna lose it any minute

Wake me
Take me out of town to the end
Of any road that you wanna go down
Make me
Make me listen all the way
To the end of any road

Because I don't know how to be here without you
I don't know how to go on
I don't know how to be here without you
I don't know how to go onEmbed
