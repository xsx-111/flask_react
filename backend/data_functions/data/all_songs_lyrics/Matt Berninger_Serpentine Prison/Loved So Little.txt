Loved So Little Lyrics
With your pulled-on hair and your punched-up lips
And your city-mouse voice
I should have known that we'd get into this
If I didn't watch the signals
And now you lean in the door in your fired-up skin
With your look of freedom, telling me that I'm in for it if I can’t keep up

It's only god or the devil when you're in it
And I'm always getting caught in the middle
It's so hard to be loved so little

Time to rip out the phone
Why are people still calling?
Don't they know that we're never gonna buy another
Batshit story of bad kids in the garden
Better bring your fear of flying and your lizard boy brain
To the top of the stairs, 'cause I don't want to have to
Come down again and find you lighting up

It's only god or the devil when you're in it
And I'm always getting caught in the middle
It's so hard to be loved so little
It's only god or the devil when you're in it
And I'm always getting caught in the middle
It's so hard to be loved so little
Only god or the devil when you're in it
And I'm always getting caught in the middle
It's so hard to be loved so littleEmbed
