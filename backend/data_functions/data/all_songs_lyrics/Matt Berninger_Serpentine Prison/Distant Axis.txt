Distant Axis Lyrics
It came back to me around a distant axis
I didn't even hear the door
I was looking up at the levels in between us
As I was sinking through the floor

If only you, if only you would come around a distant axis
I would do whatever you wanted me to
If only you, if only you would come around a distant axis
I feel like I'm as far as I can get from you

I'm getting pulled away around a distant axis
I guess I'll have to wait and see
There's a pattern to the way the world is tearing up
I think it's happening to me

If only you, if only you would come around a distant axis
I would do whatever you wanted me to
If only you, if only you would come around a distant axis

I feel like I'm as far as I can get from you
I feel like I'm as far as I can get from you
I feel like I'm as far as I can get from you2Embed
