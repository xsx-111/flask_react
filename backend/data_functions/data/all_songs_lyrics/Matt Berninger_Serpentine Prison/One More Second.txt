One More Second Lyrics
The last time we were together
Lately, it feels like forever
And the way we talked last night
It felt like a different kind of fight

Baby, don’t lie to me, you know that I’ll believe you
Always in love with someone, if it ain’t me, come on
Just give me a little more time
Give me a little bit of warning
Baby, I'm gonna be fine
When I figure out where I'm going

Why can't you just tell me what you're doing here?
Don't be cruel, if you're leaving me, just do it right here
'Cause the way you looked at me this morning
Gave my weak heart warning

Give me one more second to dry my eyes
Give me one more day to realize
Smoke's in our eyes or in the distance
Either way we're gonna miss it
Give me one more year to get back on track
Give me one more life to win you back
Smoke's in our eyes or in the distance
Either way we're gonna miss it
When it's gone
Baby, don’t lie to me, you know that I’ll believe you
Always in love with someone, if it ain’t me, come on
Just give me a little more time
Give me a little bit of warning
Baby, I’m gonna be fine
When I figure out where

Give me one more second to dry my eyes
Give me one more day to realize
Smoke's in our eyes or in the distance
Either way we're gonna miss it
Give me one more year to get back on track
Give me one more life to win you back
Smoke's in our eyes or in the distance
Either way we're gonna miss it
When it's gone


Give me one more second to dry my eyes
Give me one more day to realize
Smoke's in our eyes or in the distance
Either way we're gonna miss it
Give me one more year to get back on track
Give me one more life to win you back
Smoke's in our eyes or in the distance
Either way we're gonna miss it
When it's gone1Embed
