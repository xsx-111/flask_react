The End Lyrics
In the end we'll find another way we'll be all right
And in the end we'll face the brightest way into the light
Take me out knee deep thin lips
Stone crossed hands lips glossed pristine

And when you talk about the end the end
The end we'll always be throwing our arms around the end the end the end just you and me
Soft petaled insults to the end the end
We cannot see the bargains you and I once made the end the end

In the end they won't understand but it's all right (it's all right)
And in the end you know I'm gonna stay another night (another night)
Take me out knee deep thin lipped
Stone crossed hairs lips glossed pristine

And when you talk about the end the end
The end we'll always be throwing our arms around the end the end the end just you and me
Soft petaled, insults to the end the end
We cannot see the bargains you and I once made the end the end
The end just you and me
And when you talk about the end the end
The end we'll always be throwing our arms around the end the end the end just you and me
Soft petaled insults to the end the end
We cannot see the bargains you and I once madeEmbed
