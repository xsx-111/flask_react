Silver Springs Lyrics
Forget about what I said, I wanna meet you somewhere right now
On a glass-bottom boat, I want you to take me out
I wanna burn down a house, I want you to kill my time
I wanna meet you somewhere right now in the dandelions

Don't talk, don't cry, don't try so hard
Don't suck, don't die, get out, run far from home
They'll never understand you anyway in Silver Springs

Everyone knows where to hang, but they never show you the ropes
You'll get hit by a car, shot by a cousin, or slip off a boat
One of these days the sky's gonna rain, so why are you crying?
I wanna meet you somewhere right now in the dandelions

Sit down, grow up, drive slow all night
Be quiet, throw up, get out, go far from home
They'll never understand you anyway in Silver Springs
They'll never understand you anyway in Silver Springs
Don't talk, don't cry, don't try so hard
Don't suck, don't die, get out run far from home
They'll never understand you anyway in Silver Springs
They'll never understand you anyway in Silver SpringsEmbed
