Let It Be Lyrics
Some things I cannot hide
No matter how hard I try
Some things I can't even see
You say to me let it go
Hey lighten up a little, take a joke
Sometimes I can't let it be

Sometimes I think that I'm
My own worst enemy

Tell me the truth what you say
It won't bother me either way
Just tell me what you say about me
I don't wanna know doesn't matter now
Leave it alone try to forget about it
Sometimes I can't let it be

Sometimеs I think that I'm
My own worst enemy
Sometimеs I can't let it be

One day you'll have to let me take you
Back to the place you met me
Three Jacks and gingers later
We waited for the Sun to rise
Five o'clock in the morning sixteen billion feet above the ground
Sometimes I think that I'm
My own worst enemy
Sometimes I can't let it be
Sometimes I can't take it
Told me you'd never break it
Sometimes I can't take it
Sometimes I can't let it be1Embed
