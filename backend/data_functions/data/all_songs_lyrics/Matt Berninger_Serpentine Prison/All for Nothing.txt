All for Nothing Lyrics
Standing in the quicksand with a smiling face
I don't mean to bother
I wouldn’t want to ask no one to take my place
Who would take the offer?

It's all for nothing again
It's all for nothing

Go on float away, don’t try to orbit me
They say it's hard to live here
No one comes around, I got no gravity
The weather's unforgiving

It's all for nothing again
It's all for nothing
It's all for nothing again
It's all for nothing

Just tell me there are swimming holes in outer space
With train cars at the bottom
Everyone's a passenger in this place
Heaven’s in the water
It’s all for nothing again
It's all for nothing
It’s all for nothing again
It's all for nothing
It's all for nothing again
It's all for nothing
It’s all for nothing again
It's all for nothingEmbed
