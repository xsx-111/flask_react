Big Bird Lyrics
Open up the sky
'Cause I'm coming up to you
So send down your wings
And let 'em bring me to you
You know I'm standing at the station, ready to go
Big 'ol aeroplane, I'm trusting you so

Get on up, big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up, big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up, big bird 'cause I got to make it (Big bird)
Get on up, big bird 'cause I got to make it (Big bird)

With me down here (Me down here)
And you up there (You up there)
Now all we know is (All we know is)
It ain't no fair (It ain't no fair)
'Cause I got love packed in my baggage and I'm holdin' my claim check
Gonna be with my baby and I'm never comin' back

Get on up, big bird, to my baby's lovе
Get on up, big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up, big bird 'causе I got to make it (Big bird)
Get on up, big bird 'cause I got to make it (Big bird)
Just get on up
Open up the sky (Open up the sky)
'Cause I'm coming up to you (I'm coming up to you)
So send down your wings (Send down your wings)
And let 'em bring me to you (Let 'em bring me to you)

Get on up, big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up, big bird, to my baby's love
Get on up, big bird 'cause I got to make it (Big bird)
Just get on up (Big bird) 'cause I got to make (Big bird)

Get on up, big bird
Get on up, big bird
Get on up, big bird
Get on up, big bird
'Cause I got to make it
Get on up, big bird
Get on up, big bird
Get on up, big bird
Get on up, big bird
Get on up, big bird
Just get on up, big bird
Just get on up, big bird
Just get on up, big bird
Just get on up, big birdEmbed
