The Banality Of Evil LyricsI've got me a badge
A bright shiny badge
I'm painting the crest in yellow and blue
I've got me a club
An exclusive club
It doesn't include a place for you
Hey…..hello neighbour
Hey…..hello neighbour, right you are
It's in the way that you walk
All of the changes, all the mistakes
In the demands you constantly make
It's in the way that you grieve
All of the loss
You don't know when you're better off
Or at what cost
You've got it good
The banality of evil
Benevolent mother
Smother the child
The benefactors are in denial
Hey…..hello neighbour
Hey…..hello neighbour, right you are
There was a time
Not so long ago
I was master of everything I surveyed
Yes, there was a time
We did it my way
We'll do things my way
Benevolent mother
Smother the child
The perpetrators are in denial
The banality of evil
King of the castle
Room at the top
Off with their heads
Chop 'em off
The banality of evil
Benevolent mother
Smother the child
The benefactors are in denial
The banality of evil
King of the castle
Room at the top
Off with their heads
Chop 'em off
Hey…..hello neighbour
I don't believe in what you believe
You skin is filthy
And your gods don't look like god to me
But I want to touch you
Now that isn't right
No, that can't be right
But I want to touch you
You're leading me on I know it
Hey…
King of the castle
More room at the top
All sorts allowed
Now the gloves are off
Hey….hello neighbour
Benevolent mother
Smother the child
The benefactors are in denial
The banality of evil
King of the castle
Room at the top
Off with their heads
Chop 'em off
The banality of evil
Benevolent mother
Smother the child
The perpetrators are in denial
The banality of evil
King of the castle
Room at the top
Off with their heads
Chop 'em off
The banality of evilEmbed
