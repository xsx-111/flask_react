The Day The Earth Stole Heaven LyricsLet me tell you about a friend
She contends she will always love me
It's this ability to lie and deceive
That has lost me completely
I could remind her of the facts
Make her calm down and relax
But why bother?
It's the shallowest defense
To my utter astonishment it is over
That little girl she wants to leave me
That little girl wants something more
I'm optimistically inclined
Given time she'll change her mind
It's unlikely
Let me tell you about a friend
She contends she will always love me
If you look at her sideways
She will let you know
Today's the day the earth stole heaven
If you look at her sideways
She will curse you out
Today's the day the earth stole heaven
If you look at her sideways
There can be no doubt
It's overEmbed
