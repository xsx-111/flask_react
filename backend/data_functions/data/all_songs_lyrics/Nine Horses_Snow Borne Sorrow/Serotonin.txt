Serotonin LyricsI kick the sheets
Until they rise like mountain ranges at my feet
I'm in the dark
God only knows the torment writ large upon my heart
What wouldn't I?
What wouldn't I give?
It comes to this
I'm only sure of things I know now don't exist
There's no precision
I'm inside-outside-in I want subdivision
And all of this fills my aching head
I hate this space, the luxury hotel bed
Oh dear, oh me-oh-my
Got to concentrate just to keep from trying
Oh dear, oh me-oh-my
Got to concentrate just to keep from trying
Don't lose it
Things move rapidly
Don't lose it
Try to maintain composure
Don't lose it
The dead are haunting me
Out with it
Let's get it over
What wouldn't I?
What wouldn't I give?
I'm thoroughly wasted
My mind's hallucinating lucidity
It's over sensitized
And something's moving on the periphery
What wouldn't I?
What wouldn't I give?Embed
