Snow Borne Sorrow LyricsStrip the branches
Unsheathe the hatchets
The threads of friendship
Are coming off
The teeth of lawyers
Man the trenches
Bands of betrothal
Are coming off
But if we're good
If we're kind
But if we're good
Generous and kind
We'll inhabit their sunsets
Their goddesses and queens
We'll try to do the right thing
(Oh save them)
Oh save them
(Oh save them)
(Oh save them)
Oh save them
(Oh save them)
Let the children come to me
It's a harrowing world
Of adults and girls
Lashing out at the hurt
That surrounds them
With the knives drawn apart
They shatter the heart
Of anyone that dares come between them
Let the children come to me
Once a playground of swings
Then the malice set in
And reduced all the colours to winter
So we made it our own
This snow borne sorrow
And this love that stutters and splinters
Let the children come to me
Her apostles have gone
They left one by one
With no forwarding address to trace them
It's a secular world
Of adults and girls
And we ask because nothing is certain
Let the children come to me
When their feet touch the ground
Naked unbound
I want them to know they can trust me
There's so much to be ungrateful for
Let the children come to meEmbed
