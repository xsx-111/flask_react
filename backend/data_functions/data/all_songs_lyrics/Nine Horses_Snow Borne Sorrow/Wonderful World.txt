Wonderful World LyricsIt's a wonderful world
And you take and you give
And the sun fills the sky
In the space where you live
It's a day full of dreams
It's a dream of the day
And the joy that it brings
Nearly sweeps her away
It's a wonderful world
As the buildings fall down
And you quicken your step
Till your feet leave the ground
And you're soaring above
All the sorrow below
And your falling in love
With those you don't know
And your heart feels so wide
And your heart feels so strong
It was never a place
That you felt you belonged
It's a wonderful world
Full of wonderful things
And the people fall down
And abandon their dreams
I hear him, he's talking out loud
Sometimes he whistles while walking
How could he know any better
I weep for him
I weep for him now
It's a wonderful world
It's a real crying shame
Cause she's hurting herself
In a violent way
And there's people she knows
That won't even try
And their trapped in their lives
Feeling terrified
And it's in times like these
That you promised to call
But the scale of our love
Is diminished and small
It's a wonderful world
And she doesn't know why
She wakes up each day
And continues to cry
He's sleeping his troubles away
He's finding it's too hard to bear
I'm with him every step of the way
I weep for him
I weep for him now
It's a wonderful world
And you take and you give
And the sun fills the sky
In the space where you liveEmbed
