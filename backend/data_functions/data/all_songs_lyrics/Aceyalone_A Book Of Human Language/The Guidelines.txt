The Guidelines Lyrics
Let's begin
Asalaam alaikum, people of good will
I offer you the greeting of thought-manifested skill
To finally reveal the open-end chapter
As real as the flesh that you're embodied in
To the skull cavity your mind is rotting in, I'll be riding in
And there might have been a slight rotation warp to curve the course
Of course I'm cordial when I report, I won't distort
I don't contort, connect, conduct, collect, console, or conceal
In full control of the roll of the wheel
My eyes are my appliance to decipher the science
Omitting defiance with the high-tech mic check
The buttons that flashed I pushed for absolute destruction
Your structure is lifted from the ground
The foundation mound is broke, so you float around
I'm embedded in what is known as beat
Let it be shown, every enzyme is complete
In time, you'll see the pace of the pulse pump rapidly
Heart rate, happily marched
I happen to be the dark man who holds the charts
I arch my horizontal line to make a rainbow
But it ain't the same, though, yo
The tried and true pros are chasing fool's gold
Sliding through holes like small rodents
It's obviously evident my embellishment peaks at 292 IQ
'Cause Big Ace is the spinner in the center, inventor
And I plan to be a winner
Meaning I'll be in the inner-outer ovaries
Overload, overboard, overseas
Hearin' oversees more than the eye can
I stand, limited primitive, sentimentalist, escapist
The way I shape this landscape automatically makes this vivid
I give it a rivet, hold it, stand at the pivot
I love it, learn to live it, then give you my exhibit
Not inhibited, not even a little bit, when I'm inclined
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
And you can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guideline
You can play the sideline, write rhymes in your spare time

'Cause I'd rather stimulate your mind than emulate your purpose
And we have only touched on the surface of the serpent
Consider me part of the dust in the dusk
I must collect the samples from the rust
Penetrate the crust then trust no living
Driven by the sonic language passion
Your ashes spark the flashes of the neon from beyond
What kind of planet could I be on?
I don't know, but I'ma be on for eons and eons
While many think that they can never play out
Get trapped in a timeframe and never find a way out
I stay off the dramatization
And I balance, always seeking the challenge
To show the world the incredible talents
I cut the corners, smooth out the surfaces
Worthlessness is just half of the problem
I read the grid, kid, I did every column
I note the animal kingdom, and the phylum, wild style 'em!
Until they get to hit the target, I mark it on the bullseye of flies
And the buffalo wing in the sky
My architech-nique sparks the dark streets of your resting ground
I suggest that you warn your town
I inhabit the oxygen mark off the memory
You will never forget to remember
The lone wolverine marine biologist machine
With the verbal, internal mind fertile
Foot over hurdle, tight like girdle
And my word'll be the last
I incubate every other millennium
I fast and I hibernate, to pass any of 'em
I am potent, untraceable
No color, no odor, no taste, no replaceable parts
No heart, no head, just a carcass
The darkest days come right before the light
I watch my watch and stand right before the mic
By the powers vested in me, I digested MCs' food for thought
Caught on to the end of the rope and swung
Then stood stiff as if I was on a cliff
Not beneath sticks, my feet are made of bricks
When I walk, my footprints indent cement
I am not practical, nor am I unusual
Nor am I oblivious to hideous crimes
Every city is captured and trapped in my mind
Given the spinal tap as the final rap climbs
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time
My attempts to redefine your hip-hop guidelines
You can play the sidelines, write rhymes in your spare time

'Cause I have become the night owl on the prowl
Master of the free pen pal style
'Cause I'm omnipotent
I'm some government experiment that is out of control
I'm from some big black hole
I square up, select, and wrecked every tangle
I flare up, and you can try any angle
Even Bermuda, but I bury the barracuda
Then I'm, octa-gone in the wind with the pollen (The pollen)

That's enough of the guidelines. That's my theme music!8Embed
