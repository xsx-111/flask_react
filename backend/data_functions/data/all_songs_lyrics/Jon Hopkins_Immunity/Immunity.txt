Immunity LyricsYou've answered my prayer
For a worthless diamond in our carbon lives
You said you'd always be fine
And you said you'd never stop
Coming 'round in the dead of night
You said forever was unkind
You've answered my prayer
For a worthless diamond in our carbon lives
You said you'd always be fine
And you said you'd never stop
Coming 'round in the dead of night
You said forever was unkind3Embed
