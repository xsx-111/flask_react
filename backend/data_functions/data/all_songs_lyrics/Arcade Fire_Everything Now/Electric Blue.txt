Electric Blue Lyrics
Summer's gone and so are you
See the sky electrocute
A thousand boys that look like you
Cover my eyes electric blue

Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out I don't know shit
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

A thousand girls that look like me
Staring out at the open sea
Repeat the words until they're true
Cover my eyes electric blue
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out I don't know shit
Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it
But I found out

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Now you've got me so confused
'Cause I don't know how to sing your blues
Jesus Christ, what could I do?
I don't know how to sing your blues

Now I can't get my head around it
I thought I found it, but I found out
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you
Cover my eyes electric blue
Cover my eyes electric blue
Every single night I dream about you
Every single night I dream about you3Embed
