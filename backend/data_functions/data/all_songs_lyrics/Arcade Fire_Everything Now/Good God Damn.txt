Good God Damn Lyrics
You want to get messed up?
When the times get rough
Put your favourite record on baby
And fill the bathtub up
You want to say goodbye
To your oldest friends

With the good God damn
With the good God damn

Lay out your clothes
It's time to go
It's always darkest before the dawn
The sun never shows
I could say goodbye
To your oldest friends

Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Could there be a good God? damn
Could there be a good God? damn
Maybe there's a good God
Damn
Let me get messed up?
When the times get rough
Put your favourite record on baby
Fill the bathtub up
You could say goodbye
To your so-called friends

Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Could there be a good God? Damn
Could there be a good God? Damn
Well, maybe there's a good God, damn
Well, maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God, damn
Maybe there's a good God
If He made you

If He made youEmbed
