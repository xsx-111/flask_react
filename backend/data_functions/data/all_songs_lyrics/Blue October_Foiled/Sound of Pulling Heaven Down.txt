Sound of Pulling Heaven Down Lyrics
Somewhere, far away from here
I saw stars, stars that I could reach, yeah
It was a midnight, a silent twilight
We fell down, beyond the ocean beach, yeah

I'd assemble all the sand that cover wedding beaches
To build a castle so your mom would have a place to stay
Behind the water slide and down the hill where Heaven reaches
Land and time is left to float away, yeah
So rest assured, I have a key to every opening
To every wishing well that's deep enough to drink, drink
I want to show you just how fascinating kissing is
When Earth collides with all the space between, yeah

I'm reaching farther than I ever have before
Leaving all who broke your heart upon the shore
I may be some sort of crazy, we may be some sort of crazy
But I swear on everything I have and more

So never look behind you, spooky people bring you down
The world is ending, there's a party by the bay
I'll wear my suit and tie when I am, I am toasting to
The way you put that smile upon my face, yeah
Fill up the air balloon and ride with me
Yeah, Hell is jealous of the rain, rain
Make love like time and space is ending while befriending Fate's
Alluring way of putting us to shame
I'm reaching farther than I ever have before
Leaving all who broke your heart upon the shore
I may be some sort of crazy, we may be some sort of crazy
But I swear on everything I have and more

You make the sound of pulling heaven down
You brought the rain's romantic pour
You make the sound, you make the sound
Of pulling Heaven down

I'm reaching farther than I ever have before
(Tired of wasting time)
Leaving all who broke your heart upon the shore
(Tired of wasting time)
I may be some sort of crazy, we may be some sort of crazy
But I swear on everything I have and more
(Go, go, go, go)Embed
