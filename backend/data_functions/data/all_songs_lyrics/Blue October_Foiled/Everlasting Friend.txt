Everlasting Friend Lyrics
A heartbeat skip relationship inside a bubble bath
An icing drip below your lip, so we undo the math
A sudden slip between my pathetic sedatives
A real-life script of how mistakes became our medicine, so
Delay the hurtful words of complicated overcast
Please take the message that I'm picking up my chin at last
I said, my confidence, it gets stronger when you're next to me
But we pray from miles away, in quest for what we long to be

I might crumble, I might take a fall again
(Still missing you)
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
(Still missing you)
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
But you're my everlasting friend
Everlasting friend

A heartbeat skip relationship, so we would stay up late
A teardrop drip below your lip beside the airport gate
A sudden slip from where we used to be a year ago
A real-life script of how our hands would hold and not let go
But delay the mournful words of complicated overcast
Please take the message that you taught me how to live at last
But I said, my confidence, it gets stronger when you're next to me
But we wave, respect goodbye, in quest for what we long to be
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
(Still missing you)
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
(Still missing you)
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
But you're my everlasting friend
Will you be coming home?
(Everlasting friend)
My everlasting friend, will you be coming home?
(Everlasting friend)

I might crumble, I might take a fall again
(Still missing you)
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
(Still missing you)
I might crumble, I might take a fall again

I might crumble, I might take a fall again
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
I might crumble, I might take a fall again
I just want to know that you'll be coming home
I just want to know that you'll be coming home
I just want to know that you'll be coming home
I just want to know that you'll be coming homeEmbed
