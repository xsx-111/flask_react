What if We Could LyricsWhat if we could
Put our lives on
Hold and meet some
Where inside of the world
I would meet you
Would you meet me?
2, 3, 4...
On a park bench
On a skyscrape
On a mountain
Oh yeah, whatever it takes
I would meet you
Would you meet me?
I'm glad to say that we've met
But I'm sad to say that the circumstances weren't
On our side
So go on
Go on be your own
Go on be your own star
What if we could?
Where would we go?
If it felt right
Would you want me to know
I would meet you
Would you meet me
It's like a last chance
For a first dance
You're a sunrise
Can't somehow exist
I would meet you
Would you meet me
I'm glad to say that we've met
But I'm sad to say that the circumstances weren't
On our side
So go on
Go on be your own
Go on be your own star
A superstar in my eyes
In my eyes
Look in my eyes
Just look in my eyes
My eyes
My eyes!!!
What if we could
Put our lives on
Hold and meet some
Where inside of the world
I would meet you
Would you meet me?
On a park bench
On a skyscrape
On a mountain
Oh yeah, whatever it takes
I would meet you
Would you meet me?
God I would
God I would
I would meet you
Would you meet me
I would meet you
I would meet you
I would meet youEmbed
