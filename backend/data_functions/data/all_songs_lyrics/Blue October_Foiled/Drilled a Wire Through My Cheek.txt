Drilled a Wire Through My Cheek Lyrics
I try to stay on top of you
To hold your body down
Your shaking seems to hinder
Every grasp that I have found
Moving every inch around you
To defuse your private bomb
I stretch myself surrounding
And protecting you from harm
I use a wallet for your mouth
So when you bite, you will not bleed
I drilled a wire through my cheek
And let it down and out my sleeve
And now you're pulling out the best of me
Yeah, which never ever comes
This wire's all that's left of me
And it's hooked within my gums, within my gums

So drill it, so drill it
So hard I feel it
(So drill it)
So drill it, so drill it
So hard I feel it
(So drill it)
As proof to show I'd bleed for this
I'd cut myself to shame
To get to know this masochist
Who's stolen my first name
Pretending he's a teacher
Holding all my weight at ease
But the teacher seems to split in two
Destroying both his knees
Now crawling, I position myself
Below your broken wings
I lift your feathered left arm
Where you hide your heart from me
I never noticed it was swollen
With the touch of brutal pain
I never knew a heart could live inside
The rust from all your rain, all your rain

So drill it, so drill it
So hard I feel it
(So drill it)
So drill it, so drill it
So hard I feel it
(So drill it)
I didn't think to bring a washcloth or to rub away the dirt
Myself and I, we share this barely beating heart of hurt
And when the hurt comes, there's an argument
A fight to save a smile
A small attack on human tears to dry them for a while
A dream we all should count on, yeah, a vision I believe
In where confidence is found attached to wires on our sleeve
And where loneliness is history told to pack his shit and leave
And where guidance is a fortune told to help in time of need
And where crying isn't secret, it's the art of how we grieve
And lessons are the key to every goal I will achieve, I will achieve

So drill it, so drill it
So hard I feel it
(So drill it)
So drill it, so drill it
So hard I feel it
(So drill it)
So drill it, so drill it
So hard
(So drill it)
So drill it, so drill it
So hard
(So drill it)
So hard
So hard1Embed
