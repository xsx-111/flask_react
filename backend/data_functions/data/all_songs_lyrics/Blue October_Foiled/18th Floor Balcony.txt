18th Floor Balcony Lyrics
I close my eyes and I smile
Knowing that everything is alright
To the core, so close that door
Is this happening?
My breath is on your hair, I'm unaware
That you opened the blinds and let the city in
God, you held my hand, and we stared
Just taking in everything

And I knew it from the start
So my arms are open wide
Your head is on my stomach and we're
We're trying so hard not to fall asleep
Here we are
On this 18th floor balcony, we're both flying away

So we talked about moms and dads, about family pasts
Just getting to know where we came from
Our hearts were on display for all to see
I can't believe this is happening to me and
I raised my hand, as if to show you that I was yours
That I was so yours for the taking, I'm so yours for the taking
That's when I felt the wind pick up
I grabbed the rail while choking up
These words to say and then you kissed me, yeah
I knew it from the start
My arms are open wide
Your head is on my stomach and we're
We're trying so hard not to fall asleep
Here we are
On this 18th floor balcony, we're both flying away

And I'll try to sleep, to keep you in my dreams
'Til I can bring you home with me
I'll try to sleep
And when I do, I'll keep you in my dreams

And I knew it from the start
So my arms are open wide
Your head is on my stomach and we're
We're trying so hard not to fall asleep
So here we are
On this 18th floor balcony, yeah

I knew it from the start
So my arms are open wide
And your head is on my stomach
No, we're not going to sleep, sleep
Here we are
On this 18th floor balcony, we're both flying awayEmbed
