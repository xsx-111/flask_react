You Make Me Smile Lyrics
There's some kind of light at the end
When touching the edge of her skin

Once so hard to speak
Now so easy to play around
Catching your eye, you know
That eye that slapped you in your face
Calls you a puppy
Well, how do you say I was hypnotized?
Hypnotized

My words, they pour
Like children to the playground
Children to the playground
You make me smile

There's some kind of light at the end
Stoned, forgetful, and then
I'm drinking what used to be sin
And touching the edge of her skin

And could you be the one that's not afraid
To look me in the eye?
I swear I would collapse
If I would tell how I think you fell
From the sky
My words, they pour
Like children to the playground
Children to the playground
You make me smile

There's some kind of light at the end
Stoned, forgetful, and then
I'm drinking what used to be sin
And touching the edge of her skin

It's the feeling I get, my palms with sweat
Like some kind of daydream I'll never forget
I'm stuck in this spin, why does it begin?
By touching the edge of her skin

There's some kind of light at the end
Stoned, forgetful, and then
I'm drinking what used to be sin
And touching the edge of her skin

(You make me smile)
Woah, woah, woah, ah
Woah, woah, woah, ah2Embed
