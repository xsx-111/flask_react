Let It Go Lyrics
Where do you go
When the day is long?
And where does your heart beat?
And who is wrong?

Why do I feel this way?
Why do I kneel?
How could I let it go?
Why do I feel?
Why do I feel?
Why? How?

Follow me home
Through the, the maze and on
I'll show you the road
That I led you the wrong way on

Why'd I go that way?
Why do I steal?
How could I let her go?
Why do I feel?
Oh, why'd I go that way?
And why do I steal?
How could I let her go?
Why do I feel?
Why do I feel?
Why?

Why?

Why'd I go that way? (Why?)
Why do I need? (Why?)
How could I let her go? (Why?)
Why do I feel?
Oh, why'd I go that way?
How could I steal? (Why?)
Oh, how could I? (Why?)
How could I? (Why?)
How could I?

How could I?
How could I?2Embed
