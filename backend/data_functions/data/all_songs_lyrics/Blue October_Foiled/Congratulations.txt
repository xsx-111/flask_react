Congratulations Lyrics
Is that seat taken?
Congratulations
Would you like to take a walk with me?
My mind, it kind of goes fast
I'll try to slow it down for you
I think I'd love to take a drive
I want to give you something
I've been wanting to give to you for years
My heart

My heart, my pain won't cover up
You left me.. hu hu hu hu
(My heart)
My heart won't take this cover up
You left me.. hu hu hu hu

I came to see the light in my best friend
You seemed as happy as you'd ever been
My chance at being open was broken
And now you're Mrs. Him
My words, they don't come out right
But I'll try to say I'm happy for you
I think I'm going to take that drive
I want to give you something
I've been wanting to give to you for years
My heart
My heart, my pain won't cover up
You left me.. hu hu hu hu
(My heart)
My heart won't take this cover up
You left me.. hu hu hu hu

I can't change this, I can never take it back
But now I can't change your mind
(You left me)
And I can't take this, I can never take this back
But now I can't change your mind
Can't change your mind
(You left me)
I can't change your mind
(You left me)
(You left me)
(You left me)
(You left me)

Just make it go away
Make it go away, please2Embed
