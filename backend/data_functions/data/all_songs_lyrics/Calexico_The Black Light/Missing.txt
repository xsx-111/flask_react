Missing LyricsWake up now little sleepyhead
From your nightmarish day with the dead trip
You'd be better off not to know
Of the wild seeds you let go
From your thorny fingertips
Try to clean the bloodstained hands
That ran away and left the scene of the crime last night
Always stood on the other side
Never thought the roof would cave in where you were hiding
There's a wave of fear that creeps right in
A vacant stare that can't say where it's been
Or what's been laced
The trail leads all over the place
There's an angel at your side
Who rescued you in the nick of time
Explains how you almost fell
And vanished into a fatal spell
She looks into your eyes and sees
There's something still missing
Something's still missing
Still missing
She notices a chunk bleeding from your chest
Tries to stop the bloodflow with her best compress
But the wreckage is in a mess
An emotional tax figured in after the facts
And stories unfold
The world grows dark and bones get cold
You look into your heart and you know
There's something still missing
Something's still missing
Still missingEmbed
