Bloodflow LyricsHer eyes are closed now
That final breath is near
She lets go of my hand
And I fall into
A sea of tears
In search for the trail
That we were both riding
Lost sometime ago
Now I'm stranded on the mountain's edge
And there's only one way back
Down and down I go
Into the ground where the bad seeds are sown
And take route and pull me further in
Long and long and longer it takes
Good luck's gone and there's no more breaks
Just the ground beneath
That shakes and gives way
Swallowed up home
There ain't much now I can pull
No stuntman surprises
Or Houdini-like disguises
For death defying escape
Avoid the tap on the shoulder
From that one with a long black cape
Just to see those eyes of her shine
Is worth any sum or length of time
That would fill that space where her love once flowed
But the more I resist
The further and further I drift
Get swept out in the riptide
Where a part of me wants
To lie 'neath the ways of sorrow and tears
Sink to the bottom and linger there the rest of my years
Walk among the mild sea of bones
Of my fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers
Feel their blood flowing away
Send the soul it's wayEmbed
