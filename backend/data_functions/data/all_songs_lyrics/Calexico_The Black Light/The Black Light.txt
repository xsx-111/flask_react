The Black Light LyricsLeave the heart of the city
For the heart of the world
Leave the heart of this city
Love the way her trust unfurls
Follow her hand to the dark end of the street
Cross in the night, invisible to the electric eye
Sippin' on a little Night Train
Slippin' in to stay warm
Sleep by day, move at night
Sleep by day, keep moving, moving at night
Sleep by day, move at night
Follow her hand to the dark end of the street
Cross in the night, become invisible in a blink of an eye
Out past the border patrol (Out past the downtown city glow)
Who's thunderbird's no match (Cross the Santa Cruz and I-10)
A helicopter shadow follows you (Past the cancerous sprawl)
Way out past the downtown city glow (Into fields of thorns)
Cross the Santa Cruz (Through the Rincon Mountains)
I-10 through the Rincon's and Cochise Stronghold (And Cochise Stronghold)
South of the Chiricahuas (South of the Chiricahuas)
Drifting and drifting...
Drifting and drifting... (Drifting and drifting...)
Drifting and drifting... (Drifting...)
Drifting...Embed
