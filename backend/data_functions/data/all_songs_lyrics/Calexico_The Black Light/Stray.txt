Stray LyricsIt rained the whole day he spent at his lover's grave
Said his goodbyes to her family and friends
Packed his things in a rusted car and rode off in the rain
He came upon a church in ruin with an old man dwelling within
Who said, "Watch where you straying, my friend"
Old man spoke of meanings lost and without name
Never shifting from their worn and weathered place
What was found in the endless search for truth behind the tale
Beneath the ash and ember lies only one story to tell
Watch where you straying my friend
There's a flower that grows in a cave
So lovely to see but need to be saved
Its' beautiful blossom will wither and die
If ever this flower leave the darkness for daylightEmbed
