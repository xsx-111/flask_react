Cherry Blossoms LyricsThrough my window
Cold wind blowing
I can't take this
I can't take no more
Cars they race by
Burning headlights
In the mirror
I watch myself cry
But play me a simple song
So I can sing along
And cherry blossoms in Spring
And they mean everything
In my soul, I'm aching to grow
Longing for a love I've never known
My own life has taken its toll
Drunk on whiskey
God, don't let me go
Play me a simple song
So I can sing along
And cherry blossoms in Spring
And all the joy that it brings
Cause I've been out on the road
Driving with no place to go
From Cheyenne out to Frisco
And dying to find me a home
Take me home
