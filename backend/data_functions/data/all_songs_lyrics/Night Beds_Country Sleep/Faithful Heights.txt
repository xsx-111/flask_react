Faithful Heights LyricsWhen the sorrow comes
And you don't know why
Climb into my arms
I'll hold you through the night
And in the morning light
We'll be sure to find
A kind of love so strong
It will make us cry faithful heights
I know you get lost sometimes
Man, I know you get lost
I know you get lost sometimes
Man, I know you get lost
I know you get lost
Whenever you get lost, man
Whenever you get lost, man
Whenever you get lost hold my handsEmbed
