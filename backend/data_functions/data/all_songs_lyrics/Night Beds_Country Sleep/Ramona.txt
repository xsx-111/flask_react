Ramona Lyrics
Come on Ramona
It's getting harder
Hidden and guarded
I know you feel so alone (Alone)
Come on Ramona
They give you nothing
For bringing me something
I know you feel so alone (Alone)

With a
Heart that always fails
My love's gone off all the rails
Like a ship without a sail
Sinking
Underneath the wave (Yeah!)

Come on Ramona
Church bells are ringing
Everyone's singing
Why do we feel so alone? (Alone)
Come on Ramona
Make it your mantra
Fuck what they taught ya
Take back the life that they stole(Alone)
With a
Heart that always fails
My love's gone off all the rails
Like a ship without a sail
Drowning
Underneath the waves

With a
Heart that always fails
My love's gone off all the rails
Know that blindness has a way
To lead us
Back to fate to never
Never
Never
Never
Never
Sever

When you're gone all
The dreams in my darkness
Are they your choice
When they just finally started
When you're gone all
The dreams in my darkness
Are they your choice
When they just finally started
When you're gone all
The dreams in my darkness
Are they your choice
When they just finally startedEmbed
