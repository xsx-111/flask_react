Lost Springs LyricsOn my God, I've gone too far
The cause was mine, I know
Upon their arm to fell the night
The cause was mine to hold
Oh oh, oh oh
All my faults you saw
All my faults did you
Hear my cries as you watched me fall
But you paid no mind
To my worried eyes, I'm
Doing fine but then I'm just tired and oh
Are you able? And oh
Are you faithful?
You hear me wrong, I wanna see
If this is right, or what we need
You haunt my heart, and give it back
The promises, oh would I...
All my faults you saw
All my faults did you
Hear my cries as you
Watched me fall but you
Paid no mind to my
Worried eyes I'm
Doing fine but then
I'm just tired of all
Oh, I never have known
Why I feel so alone
I never had known, I feel so..
How you're gonna life your life alone?
How you're gonna live life on your own?
How you're gonna life your life alone?
But I don't wanna feel this in my heart
I don't wanna feel this on my own
And I don't wanna feel this anymore
And I don't wanna feel this
No, I don't wanna feel this, but
I will never leave you on your own
I will never leave you on your own
I will never leave you all alone
I will never leave you
No, I will never leave you
I will never leave youEmbed
