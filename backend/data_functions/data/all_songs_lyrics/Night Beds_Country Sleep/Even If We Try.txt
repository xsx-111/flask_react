Even If We Try Lyrics
Even if we try
Even if we try
To make ourselves alright
To mend our severed lives
While all the rivers rage
Descend upon the sage
Alone on willowed eves
I lift my voice to sing

Holding to the past
Clouding in my glass
Level on my youth
Remember what is true
As we watch the colors
Fleeting with the call of
Laces set on fire
Truth found in the mire

Stumbling down the hillside
In the waning moonlight
Hear me calling
And wailing on the doldrums
Rid ourselves of lonesome nights
Passed over
Down long, hollow grove
Its wilting, winding bones
Come on, Johnny, please
Won't you speak to me?1Embed
