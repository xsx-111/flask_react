Tenn LyricsYou feel it all the time
You're peering through the rime
You see it on your wall
You grieve and limn the squall
As I make my descent on the barroom floor
Need no more where the light looms
Maim my desire for these night fumes
Wasted again in the south
In the south
And oh my God
Now I'm scaling
Measured loss
Prone to flee this
In time you will end
The rive will mend someday
Living a life alone
In cars and ancient homes
I'm sewn in country sleep
With threaded love I keep
As I lay down my head on the hardwood floor
Need no more shiver pine strewn
Take back the time, paralyzed cue
Defeat of a man never found
Never found
And oh my God
Now I'm failing
Severed loss
Leave me something
To lean on
'Cause I've seen for far too long
These nights come have their way
On my lone wilted frame
But I will seek the
Yes, I will seek the
And I will seek the lave
Floating on lost springs
To faithful heights I cling
Sorrow stole my youth
What's left I'll give to youEmbed
