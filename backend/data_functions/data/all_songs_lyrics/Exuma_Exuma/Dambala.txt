Dambala Lyrics
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala

Sing of the wings, of a three toed frog
Eat weeds from the deepest part of the sea
Bring the trumpets from heaven
And the fire from hell
Then nobody can break the spell

Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala

On the seventh day, God will appear
On the seventh night, Satan will be there
On the seventh day, God will appear
On the seventh night, Satan will be there

Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala

You slavers will know
What it's like to be a slave
A slave to your hearts
A slave to your heads
A slave to your souls
A slave to your graves
You won't go to heaven
You won't go to hell
You'll remain in your graves
With the stench and the smell
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala

I'll melt down your walls
I'll melt your steel guns
I'll make you dumb
I'll make you blind
Dambala send demons
Dambala send angels
Dambala send fire
Dambala send water

Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala
Oh Dambala, come Dambala1Embed
