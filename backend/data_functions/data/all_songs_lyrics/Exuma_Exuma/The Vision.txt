The Vision LyricsLast night I had a vision
I saw fire in the sky
And last night. I had a vision
I saw men, that once had died
There were seven angels
You know what they said, that my time had come
Yes, those seven angels
You know they said, that the good people had won
The first angel, he looked at me and he said to me
He told me that he put the fire in the sky
The second angel, he started to cry
And he said that all the evil men must die
The third angel, said that he bought a plague
That for three months would torment man
And he said that man would pray to die
But that death would be
Just out of the reach of his hand
And the fourth angel, he had a great big urn
And when he poured all the waters of the earth turned to blood
And he said, that man didn't learn
Man didn't learn from the great big flood
Last night I had a vision
I saw fire in the sky
And last night. I had a vision
I saw men, that once had died
The fifth and six angel
Said they'd come to help man
But man being the fool he is
Turned his back and he ran
Oh lord...
All of the good people have
My time has come
The seventh angel he raised his hand
And not a word, not a word did he say
And all the dead walking throughout the land
Whispering, Whispering, it was judgment day
Last night I had a vision
I saw fire in the sky
And last night. I had a vision
I saw men, that once had died1Embed
