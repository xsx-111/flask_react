Mama Loi, Papa Loi Lyrics
The sun is shining in the night
Zombies walking in the broad day light
Zombie he don't lost his soul
Zombie he don't ever get old
Lord of darkness king of light
Come, come, come here on this stormy night
There is no star in the sky
I see fire in the dead man's eye

Mama Loi, Papa Loi
I see fire in the dead man's eye
Mama Loi, Papa Loi
I see fire in the dead man's eye

Touch me, touch me, fix my hand
Let me see what's in the sand
Man is boy, and boy is man
There ain't no boss, there ain't no man
I'll spit my spit in your spit
Then let seven snakes come up from the pit
I'll stand under this mango tree
Till you come, come to me
Mama Loi, Papa Loi
I see fire in the dead man's eye
Mama Loi, Papa Loi
I see fire in the dead man's eye (I see fire)
I see fire in the dead man's eye (In the dead man's eye)
I see fire in the dead man's eye (I see fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire in the dead man's eye)
I see fire in the dead man's eye
I see fire in the dead man's eye
I see fire in the dead man's eye
I see fire in the dead man's eye

A spider crawled across my face
Spreading its web on the human race
Jingo, Jingo, he ain't dead
He can see from the back of his head
They tied ten onions 'round my naval string
They baked it and cut it and they made it into a ring
Come on Shango, Satan come to me
Let me speak what I can't see

Mama Loi, Papa Loi
I see fire in the dead man's eye3Embed
