Seance in the Sixth Fret Lyrics(Oh yeah, get Michael Haite)
We're gonna talk to Michael Haite
(Okay, we got it, we got it now, okay)
(We gotta be silent for about 10 seconds)
-Moaning-
Hand on quill
Hand on pencil
Hand on pen
Tell me spirit
Tell me when
Say, say for you to go to that gone race of man of the past eight centuries
Michael Haite
1654-1698
Brownstone Street, Flanders, England
John Dayton
1891-1954
Six Fathom Road
Hilda Rollington
Hand on quill
Hand on pencil
Hand on pen
Tell me spirit
Tell me when
Father needs you
Your hand is made of gold
Tiny Kate was a friend of the Paya Gartees of Fax
John say to go to Radion of the far west wall of Eastern Goat and Gaul
Gaulic Satan
Out at once
Go to the well of the great God
Do not be afraid
Say lord of the wind, keeper of the seal
You must go to the heart and the head
Go to Marleet, and Sircee, and Monet, and Ozus
Say you to Jonat, say to Saya
Sonny, sonny, sonny, soy, tooth of Satan
Go away, I play my tooth to you satan
Say Soy sent you
Say I am the vessel of Charon
Tooth of soy, sayeth Obeah say sayeth said
Sooth and sayeth, seven seven seven
Hand on quill
Hand on pencil
Hand on pen
Tell me spirit
Tell me when
I am the God of Solomon
I am your God, you are my vessel
My dearest darling, it is terrible here in hell
Watch out for the Grand Master
They are calling me, I must go
Martha Thomas of Wichita
My Monday man is Johnathan Halen of , and he is far away
Darling Sandra of Willoughby Street, Connecticut
I have not forgot you
I want to be with you again
I do not like being here, it is lonely
I meet all kinds of people, rich and poor
Hell is not good
I love you, they won't let me rest
-Laughing-
God is not dead Bootleg, tut tut
My dear Samuel, I am only away for awhile
Tell the people to stop worrying
Tell the people to stop shedding blood
Tell the people to love
They're calling me
I am fading1Embed
