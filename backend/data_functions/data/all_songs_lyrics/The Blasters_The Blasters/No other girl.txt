No other girl LyricsWaitin' in an all night cafe
Drunk half out of my mind
Down to my last cigarette
Tryin' to kill some time
I don't know why I do it
Spend a day at another's girl place
She knew that when I open the door
She could see by the look on my face

Waitin' for me, she's waitin' for me
No other girl could take it
Another girl 'd just give in
Another girl 'd throw out on the street
No other girl would take me back again
A chapman takes his hat off
He likes his coffee black
Soon I'll have to face the fact
She knows that I'll be back
The busboy speaks in Spanish
The waitress checks her hair
I been so many nights on the town
She'll always be there

I don't know why I do it
Some day she might be gone
I buy a new pack of cigarettes
I've been in this joint along
No other girl would take me back again
No other girl would take me back againEmbed
