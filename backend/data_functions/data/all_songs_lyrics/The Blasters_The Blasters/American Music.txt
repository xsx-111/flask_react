American Music LyricsWell, a U.S. soldier boy on leave in West-Berlin
No music there that rocks, just a thousand violins
They wanna hear some American music
American music
They wanna hear that sound right from the U.S.A
Well, it can be sweet and lovely, it can be hard and mean
One thing's for sure, it's always on the beam
They wanna hear some American music
American music
They wanna hear that sound right from the U.S.A
Well, it's a howl from the deserts, a scream from the slums
The Mississippi rollin' to the beat of the drums
They wanna hear some American music
American music
They wanna hear that sound right from the U.S.A
We got the Louisiana boogie and the delta blues
We got country, swing and rockabilly, too
We got jazz, country-western and Chicago blues
It's the greatest music that you ever knew
It's American music
It's American music
It's American music
It's that crazy sound right from the U.S.A
Well, a US soldier boy has to stop right in his tracks
When he hears that crazy beat, he turns and doubles back
Because they're playing American music, American music
The whole world digs that sound from the U.S.AEmbed
