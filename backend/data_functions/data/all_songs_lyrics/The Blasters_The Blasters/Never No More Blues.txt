Never No More Blues LyricsMcWilliams-Rodgers
I'm just as blue as I can be
Since Susie said goodbye to me
My life is a failure, I see
And she won't be my gal
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more
I'll pack my things in a grip
Take me a long ocean trip
Out on a great big steam ship
She'll never see her daddy
No more, no more, no more
Still I hate to say farewell
To my mammy and my sister Nell
They're sure gonna cry
When I tell that I ain't comin' home
No more, no more, no more
I may be sorry someday
That I leave here and go away
But they need not ask me stay
For I'll never change my mind
No more, no more, no more
Now whether I'm right or wrong
I'm gonna be gone before long
And then I'll hush this crazy song
And I never will sing
No more, no more, no moreEmbed
