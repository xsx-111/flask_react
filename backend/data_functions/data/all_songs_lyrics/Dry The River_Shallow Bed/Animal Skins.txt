Animal Skins Lyrics
At the bottom
Of our rotten
Boat there is a
Lake
Things with many
Limbs are creeping
Round my teenaged
Legs

 (x8)
Legs
Legs
Legs
Legs
Legs
Legs
Legs
Legs

Late October
Old wives' summer
I'm all arms and
Legs
Spread out like an
Adolescent
On my shallow
Bed

(x8)
Bed
Bed
Bed
Bed
Bed
Bed
Bed
Bed


So
With animal skins around us, we go
Home
Home
So
With animal skins around us, we go
Home
Home
So
With animal skins around us, we go
Home
Home
So
With animal skins around us, we go
Home
