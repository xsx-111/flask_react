Bible Belt Lyrics
Lo and behold your mother is drinking again
This might be the coldest winter since records began
You are a low moon, steady with wintry calm
Leading the children softly across the farm

Each morning you'd march your sisters like soldiers to school
'Cause lo and behold your father had drunk all the fuel
You are a low moon, steady with wintry calm
Somewhere inside the fire of your youth went dark

But you swear blind there is no weight in the water pail
You say "My love, you take the cards that you're dealt
'Cause there's no guiding light arching a line to Bethlehem
If it's dark outside, you light the fire yourself."

Darling, when the ice caps melt
When the devil's in the bible belt
Don't cower in your bed
I'll be on the 545
You can meet me at the railway line
And don't look so scared
'Cause we've been through worse than this before we could talk
The trick of it is, don't be afraid anymore
Oh, the trick of it is don't be afraid anymoreEmbed
