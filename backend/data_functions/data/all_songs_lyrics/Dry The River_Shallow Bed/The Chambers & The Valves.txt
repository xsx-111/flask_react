The Chambers & The Valves Lyrics
Two young hearts will meet in the middle
And a light will flicker on
Where there once was none
Where does love come from?
The bodies in the firmament are spinning like a plate;
I was lost in the fission before you came


I could write this down, I could turn this car around
In the land of mistakes I should lay my crosses down
And I pray for your health, and I tell myself
“It’s the chambers and the valves that pump the sentiment around.”
But I swallow the words and I close my mouth


If every constellation above us has a counterpart below
How are we to know, dear? How are we to know?
Fortune hangs around us like a funerary wreath
I was down in the heart of the ground beneath

I could write this down, I could turn this car around
In the land of mistakes I should lay my crosses down
And I pray for your health, and I tell myself
“It’s the chambers and the valves that pump the sentiment around.”
But I swallow the words and I close my mouthEmbed
