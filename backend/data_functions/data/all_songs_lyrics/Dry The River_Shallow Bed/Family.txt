Family Lyrics
So much for reason when, cold and unfeeling
It brings every trial to your door
When worries are swarming like bats in the morning
Or shadows of moths on the wall
Shadows of moths on the wall

Lover, remember:
The sorghum and the cane shake
We don’t

Here comes the breath, comes the unwanted guest
The flock before dogs taking shape
In henna and feathers it sweeps through the desert
When something you love is at stake
Something you love is at stake

Lover, remember:
The sorghum and the cane shake
We don’t
Lover, the weather
Is changing every day
I won’t
Under the mountains are roofs of our houses and homes
There with your mother, your father and brother, below
Bury your worry, your worry, your worry tonight
Follow your mother, your father and brother back home

Lover, remember:
The sorghum and the cane shake
We don’t
Lover, the weather
Is changing every day
I won’t

Follow your mother, your father and brother back home
Follow your mother, your father and brother back homeEmbed
