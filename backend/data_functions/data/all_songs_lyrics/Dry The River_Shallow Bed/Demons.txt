Demons Lyrics
You are the string in my bow
Biblical Mary to Joe
The North isn't true 'til it's leading me to you
You are the way that I know

Under the weight of belief
You shiver and shake like a leaf
But death is a force, not a man on a horse:
Iâ€™ll keep you safe while you sleep

And fight those demons day in and day out
Day in and day out, day in and day out
And fight those demons day in and day out
Day in and day out, day in and day out
And fight those demons day in and day out
Day in and day out, day in and day out
Day in and day out, day in and day outEmbed
