New Ceremony Lyrics
I waited by your bedside
And couldn't close my eyes all night
I named you like a prayer
It's anybody's guess how
The angel of doubt came down
And crept into your bed
But after we danced to the shipping forecast
The words escaped your mouth:
"I know it's gotta stop love, but I don't know how."


Now the stairs forget your shoes
And the gate don't creak for want of you
But the jury's out on me
We're wise beyond our years
But we're good at bad ideas, my love
Or so it seems to be

Shine a little light
Don't wrestle with the night
Don't think about the future now
I know it's gotta stop love but I don't know how
My little one
My kettle drum
I know I had a message at the start
My babel tongue
My come-undone
I know I had a message at the start
My prison kiss
My dying wish
I know I had a message at the start
But it up and abandoned us, when we were sleeping in our beds


It's anybody's guess how the angel of doubt laid down
Sand beneath our house
I know it's gotta stop love, but I don't know how
I know it's gotta stop love, but I don't know howEmbed
