Shield Your Eyes Lyrics
I’m burning like an effigy in here:
The summer’s come to haunt me
And I know I’m not the sacrificial deer
But I wish you could’ve warned me

Of the Phrygian Lion
With his excellent eyesight
At the gate of our love

I understood the chemistry of peace;
You covered me in warpaint
When Moses was a whisper in the reeds
I carved you in the floodplain

Of the Phrygian Lion
With his excellent eyesight
At the gate of our love

Under sweet autumnal skins is our myth dispelled
In your strange and simple way
Of the Phrygian Lion
With his excellent eyesight
At the gate of our love
Of the Phrygian Lion
With his excellent eyesight
At the gate of our love
Of the Phrygian Lion
With his excellent eyesight
At the gate of our love1Embed
