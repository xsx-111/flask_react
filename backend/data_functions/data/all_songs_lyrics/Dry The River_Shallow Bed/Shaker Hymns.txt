Shaker Hymns Lyrics
With my family on the right hand side
And your family on the left
We got married in a single bed
And sang shaker hymns
When your warhorse grandfather had sung
The whole damn Song of Solomon
We toasted health in the front room
We whiled away the afternoon


Ma fleur struck down with sickness
The young medicine man's got his face in a book
There's more bottles than the trees in green England
Not one of them will do my love no good


In the morning I'm light
But in the evening I'm heavy now
Try as I might I just can't keep it steady now
My loveEmbed
