Headlock Lyrics
Distant flickerings, greener scenery
This weather's bringing it all back again
Great adventures, faces in condensation
I'm going outside and take it all in

You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this

Wear a different pair, do something out of step
Throw a stranger an unexpected smile
With big intention, still posted at your station
Always on about the day it should have flied

You say too late to start
Got your heart in a headlock
I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this
Afraid to start
(How can you lose? How can you lose?)
Got your heart in a headlock
(How can you lose? How can you lose?)
I don't believe any of it
(How can you lose?)
You say too late to start
(How can you lose? How can you lose?)
With your heart in a headlock
(How can you lose? How can you lose?)
You know you're better than this
(How can you lose?)
You've been walking, you've been hiding
And you look half dead half the time
Monitoring you, like machines do
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye
You've been walking, you've been hiding
And you look half dead half the time
Monitoring you, like machines do
You've still got it, I'm just keeping an eye

You know you're better than this

Can't make a start
Got your heart in a headlock
No, I don't believe any of it
You say too late to start
With your heart in a headlock
You know you're better than this
Afraid to start
(How can you lose? How can you lose?)
Got your heart in a headlock
(How can you lose? How can you lose?)
I don't believe any of it
(How can you lose?)
You say too late to start
(How can you lose? How can you lose?)
With your heart in a headlock
(How can you lose? How can you lose?)
You know you're better than this
(How can you lose?)3Embed
