Speeding Cars Lyrics
Here's the day you hoped would never come
Don't feed me violins, just run with me through rows of speeding cars
The paper cuts, the cheating lovers, the coffee's never strong enough
I know you think it's more than just bad luck

There, there, baby, it's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC's of growing up
Now, now, darling, oh, don't lose your head
Cause none of us were angels, and you know I love you, yeah

Sleeping pills, no sleeping dogs lie never far enough away
Glistening in the cold sweat of guilt
I've watched you slowly winding down for years
You can't keep on like this, now's a bad a time as any

There, there baby, it's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC's of growing up
Now, now, darling, oh, don't kill yourself
Cause none of us were angels and you know I love you, yeah

It's okay by me, it's okay by me, it's okay by me
It was a long time ago (Yeah, yeah)
It's okay by me (it's alright with me), it's okay by me (it's alright with me), it's okay by me
It was a long time ago...

There, there baby, it's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC's of growing up
Now, now, darling, oh, don't lose your head
Cause none of us were angels and you know I love you, yeah

There, there baby, it's just textbook stuff
It's in the ABC's of growing up
Now, now, darling, oh, don't kill yourself
Cause none of us were angels and you know I love you, yeah4Embed
