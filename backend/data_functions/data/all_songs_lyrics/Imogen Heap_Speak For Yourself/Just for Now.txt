Just for Now Lyrics
Just for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side
Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head

I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me

It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
If just for a little while
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
I'm secretly on your side

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here

Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of...

Just for now, just for now...5Embed
