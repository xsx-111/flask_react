Loose Ends Lyrics
Dum, di-di-di-da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-dum

Doing everything by halves
You've got a real flair with excuses
Meeting someone at the bar
Where loose ends still have uses

It's complicated
This time I think it could be
Triangulated
It could be just what we need
So what do you say, we give it up and walk away?
We're overrated anyway

Dum, di-di-di-da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-dum
We're kissing without kissing
And got it down to a fine art
Love's supposed to keep you young and frisky
But we grew up and wide apart (Tick-tock, tick-tock)

Not now, not ever, no, it's never a good time (Tick-tock)
How will the good times ever roll on? (Tick-tock)
Comparing photos then and now, now and then
Just wondering (wondering...) where it all went wrong

It's complicated
This time I think it could be
Triangulated
It could be just what we need
So what do you say, we give it up and walk away?
Nothing to salvage anyway

Want to? (Oh)
Need to? (Oh)
Try to? (Oh)
None of the above
Want to? (Oh)
Need to? (Oh)
Try to? (Oh)
None of the above
Want to? (Oh)
Need to? (Oh)
Try to? (Oh)
None of the above
Want to? (Oh)
Need to? (Oh)
Liar!
Liar!

Dum, di-di-di-da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-dum, da-da-da-dum
Di-di-di-da-da-da-dum, da-da-da-dum, da-da-dum

It's complicated
This time I think it could be
Triangulated
It could be just what we need
So what do you say, we give it up and walk away?
We're overrated anyway
It's complicated
This time I think it could be
Triangulated
It could be just what we need
So what do you say, we give it up and walk away?
Nothing to salvage anyway

Liar!
