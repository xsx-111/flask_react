Clear the Area Lyrics
Knock knock - are you alone?
No one's out here and I was not followed
Love, love - you're already home
Party's over and you don't look so good

You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear (Please clear the area)
When you find your way back down in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here (Right here, right here)
Right here

Low light, mercury morning
No need to stay as it's always "nothing"
But your eyes tell a whole other story
And I feel the weight of the world

You won't talk, you won't try (You won't talk, you won't try)
Just move, it's too still in your sadness (Just move)
Cry, give up (Cry, give up)
It's okay, you've just got to trust me (It's okay)

You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear (Please clear the area)
When you find your way back down in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here (Right here, right here)
Right here
Slowly, darling (Slowly, darling)
Nobody means anymore to me than you
If you're in, baby then I'm in (If you're in, into this)
With you always
Careful, close to the edge there (Careful, you're scaring me)
Fall into my arms
Away with it all
Fall, fall into love, love

You find your way back down
And I'll keep the area clear (Please clear the area)
When you find your way back down in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here (Right here, right here)
Right here
You find your way back down (Mmm, way back down)
And I'll keep the area clear (So please clear the area)
When you find your way back down in one piece
Then I'll just be waiting here (Right here, right here)
Right here2Embed
