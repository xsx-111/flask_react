Goodnight and Go Lyrics
Say goodnight and go
(Woah, woah, woah)

Skipping beats, blushing cheeks, I am struggling
Daydreaming, bed scenes in the corner caf√©
And then I'm left in bits recovering tectonic tremblings
You get me every time

Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go
(Woah, woah, woah)

Follow you home, you've got your headphones on and you're dancing
I've got a lucky beautiful shot, you're taking everything off, watch the curtains wide open
And you fall in the same routine flicking through the TV, relaxed and reclining
And you think you're alone...

Oh, why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go
One of these days, you'll miss your train and come stay with me
(It's always say goodnight and go)
We'll have drinks and talk about things, any excuse to stay awake with you
You'd sleep here, I'd sleep there, but then the heating may be down again
(At my convenience)
We'd be good, we'd be great together

Go!

Why d'ya have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you
Must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Say goodnight and go

Oh, why's it always, always...
Goodnight and go
Oh, darling, not again
Goodnight and go7Embed
