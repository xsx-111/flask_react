Daylight Robbery Lyrics
Don't mind me, just cruising by
By the girl with the balloon
Good, it looks like we're the only ones around
Caught on CCTV heading towards the city
Lights winking diamonds at me
Arms stretched out now

Ha-ooooo, ha-ooooo
Oh, it gets me every time
Ha-ooooo, ha-ooooo
Oh, it gets me every time

Happiness and silhouettes
Revolving in the deep water indigo
It's high tide, night sky
Pleasure moment - thinking big, thinking positive
And itching to get on with it
It's all stops out

Excess is the new moderation
Get dressed up to the power of ten
Raise glasses
On repeat and again, again, again
Again, again, again, again...
Ha-ooooo, ha-ooooo
Oh, it gets me every time
Ha-ooooo, ha-ooooo
Oh, it gets me every time

Oh, wade in the sonic joy
Pleasure the wave and syncronise
Sway in the sonic joy

Ha-ooooo

Ha-ooooo, ha-ooooo
Oh, it gets me every time
Ha-ooooo, ha-ooooo
Oh, it gets me every time

Every time
It gets me right here
Every time
It gets me right here
Every time2Embed
