Hide and Seek Lyrics
Where are we?
What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to fall
Crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling
Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes
This can't be happening
When busy streets amass with people
Would stop to hold their heads heavy

Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
All those years
They were here first

Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung before
The takeover, the sweeping insensitivity
Of this still life

Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
Oh, you won't catch me around here
Blood and tears
They were here first
Mmm, whatcha say?
Mmm, that you only meant well?
Well, of course you did
Mmm, whatcha say?
Mmm, that it's all for the best?
Of course it is
Mmm, whatcha say?
Mmm, that it's just what we need
And you decided this?
Mmm, whatcha say?
Mmm, what did she say?

Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak no feeling, no, I don't believe you
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit
Ransom notes keep falling out your mouth
(Hide and seek)
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak, no feeling, no, I don't believe you
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a, you don't care a bit
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit, you don't care a bit44Embed
