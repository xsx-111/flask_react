Have You Got it In You? Lyrics
It takes a lot
To be always on form, it takes a lot
I maybe not
All the time, all I've got, maybe not

Been one of those days
Safety first, don't push
What's the hurry?
One nerve remaining
Waiting on one look
Have you got it?
Have you got it in you?
Have you got it in you?

All at once
Not a whisper nor word, then all at once
(Let me have it all, let me have it battle on)
(Easy target look can we just, just get it over with?)
It's getting worse
Against all the odds it's getting worse
(Guard down, floor's yours)
(Last man standing, can we just get it over with?)
Been one of those days
Safety first, don't push (Don't push me)
What's the hurry?
'Cause there's one nerve remaining
Waiting on one look (One look, one)
Have you got it?
Have you got it in you?
Have you got it in you?

Blue, blue day make me blue
Head down, quick, take cover
Big girl in a mood
Blue you, make me anymore blue
Long spin, shout, power clean
Right out of your suit

Been one of those days
Safety first, don't push
What's the hurry?
One nerve remaining
Waiting on one look
Have you got it?
Have you got it in you?
Have you got it in you?
Have you got it in you?
Have you got it in you?
Have you got it in you?2Embed
