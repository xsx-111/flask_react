The Moment I Said It Lyrics
The moment I said it
The moment I opened my mouth
Lead in your eyelids
Bulldozed the life out of me
I know what you're thinking
But, darling, you're not thinking straight
Sadly things just happen, we can't explain

It's not even light out
But you've somewhere to be
No hesitation
No, I've never seen you like this
And I don't like it, I don't like it
I don't like it at all

Just put back the car keys
Or somebody's going to get hurt
Who are you calling at this hour?
Sit down, come round, I need you now
We'll work it all out together
But we're getting nowhere tonight
Now sleep, I promise it'll all seem better somehow, in time
It's not even light out
Suddenly, suddenly
Ooh, you've somewhere to be
No hesitation
Mmm, I've never seen you like this
You're scaring me, you're scaring me
You're scaring me to death

Don't, oh... smash please
Don't, oh... and a-please-nother one
Don't, oh... smash please
Don't, oh... and a-please-nother one

I'm losing you
I'm losing you

Trust me on this one
I've got a bad feeling
Trust me on this one
You're going to throw it all away
With no hesitation... smash
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye...
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye...
Bye bye bye bye bye bye...4Embed
