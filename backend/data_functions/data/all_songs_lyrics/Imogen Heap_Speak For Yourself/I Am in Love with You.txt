I Am in Love with You Lyrics
I am in love with you
I am in love with you, baby
I am in love with you, yeah
Live for the moment

Right now another please
Right now another please, just like that
Like that another one, babe
Kiss me for longer

Oh hey, baby don't you run away
Oh hey, baby don't you run away
Come here and finish what you started

I am in love with you
I am in love with you, baby
I am in love with you, yeah
At least for the moment

Split second and it's all in smoke, yeah
Split second and it's all in smoke, yeah
Split second and it's all in smoke, yeah
So wet this fire dry
No don't get yourself in situations
No don't get yourself in situations
Darling, that you can't handle

No, I don't mind if you forget yourself
No, I don't mind
Did you forget yourself, darling?

Come on into my bed with me
Come on into my bed with me
(You know you want to)
Come on into my bed with me
Come on into my bed with me
(You know you want to)

Iâ€™m not in love with you
I'm not in love with you, baby
I'm not in love with you, yeah

Not anymore
Not anymore
