Green Door Lyrics
Midnight
One more night without sleeping
Watching
'til the morning comes creeping
Green door
What's that secret you're keeping?

There's an old piano and they play it hot
Behind the green door
Don't know what they're doing but they laugh a lot
Behind the green door
I wish they'd let me in so I could find out what's
Behind the green door

Knocked once
Tried to tell them I'd been there
Door slam
Hospitality's thin there
Wonder
Just what's going on in there

I saw an eye ball peeping through a smoky cloud
Behind the green door
Well, I said Joe sent me someone laughed out loud
Behind the green door
All I wanna do is join the happy crowd
Behind the green door
Midnight
One more night without sleeping
Watching
'til the morning comes creeping
Green door
What's that secret you're keeping?
Green door
What's that secret you're keeping?
