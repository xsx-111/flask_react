Under the Wires LyricsDon't hang up
Don't hang up
Don't hang up
Under the wires
Somewhere out there
If I could just get in touch
If I could just get in touch
Disconnected connections
Misdirected directions
It gets so very hard
It gets so very hard
Dial tone degradation
Uncontrolled aggravation
I got too many hang ups
I got too many hang ups
What color panties are you wearing?
What color panties are you wearing?
What color panties are you wearing?
And how long have you been wearing them?
I let my fingers do the walking
To find out to whom I am talking
When they see me in your gee
You're gonna hear from me
You're gonna hear from me
I ain't got no choice
You're gonna know my voice
Twins wire desire
Receive her ire
I'm gonna cut you off
I'm gonna cut you off
And if you think I'm sick
And if you think I'm sick
