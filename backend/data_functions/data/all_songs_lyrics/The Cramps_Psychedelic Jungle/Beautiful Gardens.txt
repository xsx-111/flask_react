Beautiful Gardens Lyrics
Oh my, oh me
What in the world's come over me?
I'm seeing things that I should never see
Spiders in my eyelids and ghosts in the cheese
What in the world's come over me?

I've lost touch with reality
Reality
Reality
Reality

Oh my, oh me
The dead walk the angry sea
Vampire lesbos are after me
I'm coming unhinged, weak in the knees

I'm floating away from reality
Reality
Reality
Reality

Hear the wind whistle through my noggin
"Palisades Park" by Freddy Cannon
Ride the void to outer space
Pull my eyeballs right out of my face
A world of leather-work and rubber ashtrays
Beautiful gardens and all kinds of games
Oh, I've had way too much of me

And now I can't get back to... reality
Reality
Reality
Reality
Reeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllll...

That's enough

You know, something?
Music sure sounds better than it used to1Embed
