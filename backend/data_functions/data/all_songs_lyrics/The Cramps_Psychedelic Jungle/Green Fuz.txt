Green Fuz Lyrics
Here we come, we're coming fast
All the others are in the past
Jump to your feet, let us get you high
We're the green fuz

We're not too fast, we're not too slow
Come along baby to see where we go
Jump to your feet, let us catch your eye
We're the green fuz

We're coming fast and I'll tell you why
Jump to your feet, let us catch your eye
Here we come baby and you'd better run
We're the green fuz


Ooh we're coming fast, I'll tell you why
Jump to your feet, let us catch your eye
Here we come baby and you'd better run
We're the green fuz
Here we come baby and you'd better run
We're the green fuz
Here we come baby and you'd better run
We're the green fuzEmbed
