Primitive Lyrics
What I don't know
Can never hurt me
I live a life
That's working for me
What I respect
You just can't see
What you expect
I'll never be

Primitive
That's how I live
Primitive
I take what you give

'Cause I love
And I live
Primitive

The things I do
You'd never try
What I get free

Primitive
That's how I live
Primitive
I take what you give

'Cause I love
And I live
Primitive

Primitive
That's how I live
Primitive
I take what you give

'Cause I love
And I live
