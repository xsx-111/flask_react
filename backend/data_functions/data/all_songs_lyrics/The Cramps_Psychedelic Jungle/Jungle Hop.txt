Jungle Hop Lyrics
Far away in Africa
They all come from near and far
Rock all night and never stop
Dancing to the jungle hop

Uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah

Take the skins of 10 giraffes
For one beat-up phonograph
Hey, now they dance and do the bop
They rock all night to jungle hop

Uh uh uh uh
Uh uh uh uh
Rock!

Under jungle stars above
All night make jungle love
Have a ball and blow their tops
They rock all night to jungle hop
Uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ahEmbed
