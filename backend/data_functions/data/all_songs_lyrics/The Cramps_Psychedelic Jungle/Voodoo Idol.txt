Voodoo Idol Lyrics
Voodoo
Voodoo
Voodoo
Voodoo

The night came down, the sky turned black
The jungle drum beat, the natives back
The voodoo idol stepped forward from the crowd
Lightning split the sky and thunder shook the ground

He had coal black hair and laser eyes
His pale white skin against the darkened skies
Seemed to say that the wind was at his call
Then a silence fell as the Idol said nothing at all

And then he raised his hands, the night stood still
He looked around at the crowd until
The voodoo doctor gave him a guitar
Then they all bowed down in the light of the voodoo star
And it sounded like this

And there he passed through their hungry lips
His holy blessed sacrament
He spoke no words but they all knew what it meant
Yeah, he rolled on the ground and he danced while reading his hands

Yeah and then he rolled his eyes and sang from his heart
The jungle creatures from near and far
Came to lose their minds under his spell
And then what happened next to this day no one will tell

He sang voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
He sang voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodooEmbed
