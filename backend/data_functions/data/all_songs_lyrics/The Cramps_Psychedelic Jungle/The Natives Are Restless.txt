The Natives Are Restless Lyrics
Well, there's an uprising down on Watusi Street
And the witch doctor don't know what to think
Well, the big chief says it isn't so
They get dressed up, messed up, ready to go

And the natives are restless
The natives are restless tonight

Yeah, they're doing a dance no one's ever seen
And they're barbecuing real human beans
They pick their teeth with porcupine
And wash you down with jungle wine

Ooh, the natives are restless
The natives are restless tonight
(Mmm, wanna bite?)

Well, in the heat of the city, it's hard to be cool
You don't wanna do nothing too terri-bool
But in my neighborhood, there's something you should know
When the drum beat starts, it's time to go
Ooh, the natives are restless
The natives are restless tonight
Tonight!
Tonight!Embed
