Simple Lyrics
I was simple (simple)
I was simple (simple)
When I laid beside you
Now I know it's all through
It's not true

I was simple (simple)
I was simple (simple)
I was simple (simple)
Since the day I found you
Time just meant an old rule
Now it's true

Loving you is groovin'
Don't you know it's foolish?
Just to say I think of those lies
Just to pray you're still mine
Just to cry we've been right

I was simple (simple)
I was simple (simple)
Simple
Simple
Since the day I found you
Time just meant an old rule
Now it's true
Loving you is groovin'
Don't you know it's foolish?
Just to say I think of those lies
Just to pray you're still mine
Just to cry we've been right

I was simple (simple)
I was simple (simple)
Simple
