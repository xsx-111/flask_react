Yellow Sea Days LyricsMarch 7th

Someday I'll fly
Still falling through
I am deep down inside
My mind

I know it's hard to tell
So follow me

My frame, ooh, frame
I was born in-line with the moon
Right there, a romantic circus man
Swings
Don't keep your mind in a shelf
Fire castle hiding my sins
March 8th

Hard to find a way
Hard to find my way
My, my, my, my
I don't know, oh, baby
Oooh, yeaaah
Take my hand
Take my hand
Can't do this anymore
Take my hand
Got to find my woman
Got to find my pretty woman
Yeah, baby, oh baby, yeah!
March 9th

Baby, baby
Maybe try
I'd love to screw you, Don
Aaaaah!
Baby mama
Look at my house
(Peruvian speaking)
