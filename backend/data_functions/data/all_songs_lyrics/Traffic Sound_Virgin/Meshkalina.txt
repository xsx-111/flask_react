Meshkalina Lyrics
Yawar Huaca wondered why he was high once
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya
Brand the witch and kill the wild Ayarmacas
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya

Let me down, meshkalina
Let me down, meshkalina

Full of bull he was, oh God let me tell you
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya
Spread the weed one day, all over his empire
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya

Let me down, meshkalina
Let me down, meshkalina
Ooh
Aaaah, oooh, aaah


Huaca stayed for fifteen days in his lab once
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya
He said "Man it's hot, let's try my new substance"
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya
Give me some, meshkalina
Give me some, meshkalina
Ooh

We went driving hard and wild across the country
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya
We were having fun, even though we were dying
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya

Let me die, meshkalina
Let me die, meshkalina
Ooh
Aaaah, meshkalina


Now I know it's time for you to start learning
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya ya
About the games we play everyday, every morning
Ya ya ya ya, ya ya ya ya ya yaEmbed
