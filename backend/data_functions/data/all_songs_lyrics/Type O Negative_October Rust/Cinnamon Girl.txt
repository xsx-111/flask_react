Cinnamon Girl LyricsAchtung
Ein, zwei, drei, vier
My cinnamon girl
My cinnamon girl
I want to live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life with her
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chase the moonlight, ah
My cinnamon girl
My cinnamon girl
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes, waits between shows, ah
(Feels like)
A dreamer of pictures, I run in the night
You see us together, chase the moonlight
(All right)
My cinnamon girl
My cinnamon girl
Mom, send me money now
I'm gonna make it somehow
I need another chance
You see my baby loved to dance, yeah, yeah
(Feels like)
(All right)
Ein, zwei, drei, vier
My cinnamon girl
My cinnamon girl
Ooh!Embed
