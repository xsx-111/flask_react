Be My Druidess LyricsBe my druidess
Be my everything
Be my druidess
Be mine
Around the pyre, a circle of thirteen
Throughout these woods, ecstatic screams
I look deeply into your eyes
I smell your hair, caress your thighs
Now we'll make love by fire light
A blaze so high, it lights the night
Long fingernails dug in my skin
Yourself so wet, invites me in
Be my druidess
Be my everything
Be my druidess
Be mine
Our lust increased, feeds desire
As we combust, yeah we on fire
I feel you shake so deep inside
Ooh, scream my name and squeeze me tight
I'll do anything to make you cum
I'll do anything to make you
Be my druidess
Be my everything
Be my druidess
Be mine
I'll do anything to make you cum
I'll do anything to make you
I'll do anything to make you cum
I'll do anything to make you cum
I'll do anything to make you cum
I'll do anything to make you
I'll do anything
I'll do anything
I'll do anything
I'll do anything to make you1Embed
