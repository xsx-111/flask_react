Wolf Moon (Including Zoanthropic Paranoia) LyricsThe 28th day
She'll be bleeding again
And in lupine ways
We'll alleviate the pain
Unholy water
Sanguine addiction
Those silver bullets
A last blood benediction
It is her moon time
When there's iron in the air
A rusted essence
Woman may I know you're there
Unholy water
Sanguine addiction
Those silver bullets
A last blood benediction
Hey wolf moon
Come cast your spell on me
Hey wolf moon
Come cast your spell on me
Don't spill a drop dear
Let me kiss the curse away
Yourself in my mouth
Will you leave me with your taste?
Hey wolf moon
Come cast your spell on me
Hey wolf moon
Come cast your spell on me
Beware
The woods at night
Beware
The lunar light
So in this gray haze
We'll be meeting again
And on that great day
I will tease you all the same
Unholy water
Sanguine addiction
Those silver bullets
A last blood benediction
Hey wolf moon
Come cast your spell on me
Hey wolf moon
Come cast your spell on me
Beware
The woods at night
Beware
The lunar light1Embed
