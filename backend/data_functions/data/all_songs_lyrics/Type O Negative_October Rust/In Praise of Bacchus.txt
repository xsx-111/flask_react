In Praise of Bacchus LyricsHey, Bacchus!
She hates me
Hey, Bacchus!
She hates me
Hey, Bacchus!
She hates me
Hey, Bacchus!
She hates me
The street lamps light a wet, old Red Hook road
A furry vino-tinted slave
Molten oil-painted Brooklyn Bridge
(cobblestone grave)
A lonely blue girl guards the river bed
She shakes her brown torch at the tide
On Pier Six we'd creep and count the cracks
(side by side, see, we're counting cracks)
Your mom was out wearing herself inside
I'll stop the train to say hello
A used boyfriend's just bought her this new car
(I said, I know)
She said burn
Together
Burn
We'll burn together
Hey, Bacchus!
She hates me
Hey, Bacchus!
She hates me
She hates me
She hates me
She said burn together
She said burn together
(Burning together)
Burn, we'll burn together
(Burning together)
Now don't believe she'll never leave again
I can't forget the words she said, way back when
Dirai Di, Sincto Sin, Dominai, Requiem
She said burn
We'll burn together
(Burning together)Embed
