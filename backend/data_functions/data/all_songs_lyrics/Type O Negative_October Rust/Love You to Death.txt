Love You to Death Lyrics
In her place, one hundred candles burning
Her salty sweat drips from her breast
Her hips move and I can feel what they're sayin', swayin'
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...
Yeah...

Black lipstick stains her glass of red wine
I am your servant, may I light your cigarette?
Those lips move, yeah, I can feel what you're sayin', prayin'
They say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...

I beg to serve, your wish is my law
Now close those eyes and let me love you to death
Shall I prove I mean what I'm sayin', beggin'
I say the beast inside of me is gonna get ya, get ya, yeah...

Ah...
Let me love you to...
Ah...
Let me love you to...
Death
To death...
Ah...
Let me love you to...
Ah...
Let me love you to...
Death
To death...

Am I good enough...
For you?
Am I good enough...
For you?
Am I...ah...
For you?
Am I....ah...
For you?

Am I good enough
For you?4Embed
