Ego LyricsI've been dying to say this to you
And I don't know what else to do
I've seen your fucking attitude
Well I've been doing someone that you know
It's not a secret to me anymore
'Cause I've seen you blowing around my fame
With empty words our worlds collide
It was my ego telling me why
I never thought I'd say this to you
I lied about you, regrets are useless
Was it my ego saying why
I've been dying to say this to you
And I don't know what else to do
I've seen your fucking attitude
Yeah
Well I've been doing someone that you know
It's not a secret to me anymore
'Cause I've seen you glowing around my fame
With empty words our worlds collide
It was my ego telling me why (You wanted someone who cared!)
With empty words our worlds collide (You needed someone to care!)
It was my ego telling me why
I never thought I'd say this to you
I lied about you, regrets are useless
Was it my ego saying why
With empty words our worlds collide
It was my ego telling me why (You wanted someone who cared!)
With empty words our worlds collide (You needed someone to care!)
It was my ego telling me why
I never thought I'd say this to you
I lied about you, regrets are useless
Was it my ego tellin' me
Was it my ego tellin' me whyEmbed
