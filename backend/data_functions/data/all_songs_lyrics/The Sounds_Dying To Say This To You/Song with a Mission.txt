Song with a Mission LyricsHey what do you say I got a 15 million dollar contract coming my way
This song is not for you only for people living like we do, and not for the true
So don't you think I know whats wrong
You are acting like I don't witness stories
But you can't push us down
This song is not for you
Only for people living like we do, and not for the true
Hey baby with a one two three four
Five you've been missing
You're feeling shitty
I don't feel no pity
Without me you're nothing at all
Hey what do you say I got a 15 million dollar contract coming my way
This song is not for you only for people living like we do, and not for the true
Hey baby with a one two three four
Five with a mission
You're feeling shitty
I don't feel no pity
Without me you are nothing at all
This song is not for you only for people living like we do, and not for the true
To all you liars
Who will retire
Don't believe in what they say and what you always been told
Yeeeah!
Hey baby with a one two three four
Five you've been missing
You're feeling shitty
I don't feel no pity
Without me you are nothing at all
Hey baby with a one two three four
Five with a mission
To all you liars
Who will retire
Don't believe in what they say and what you always been told
This song is not for you only for people living like we do, and not for the true
Don't believe in what they say and what you always been told
Don't believe in what they say and what you always been toldEmbed
