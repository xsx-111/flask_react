Mine for Life LyricsMan I'm in trouble, 'cause I can't see clear
My head is pounding harder and you're not here, are never here
But I had it once, but not anymore
Well now I am tired and now I am bored, well I'm so bored
But I could never leave you, even though I've tried
No I could never leave you, 'cause you are mine for life
I've been lost I've been found, I've been fooling around
I've been hold, I've been told, I've been changing my mind
I've been up, I've been down, come on in, take your time
I've been low, I've been high, I'm in love with this lie
Aooooooo. Do you feel the same?
Aooooooo. It wears me out again
If this is called living, well don't count me in
Sure I feel alive, but it doesn't mean a thing, no nothing
But I could never leave you, even though I've tried
No I could never leave you, 'cause you are mine for life
I've been lost, I've been found, I've been fooling around
I've been hold, I've been told, I've been changing my mind
I've been up, I've been downn, come on in, take your time
I've been low, I've been high, I'm in love with this lie
Aooooooo. Do you feel the same?
Aooooooo. It wears me out again
Aooooooo. Do you feel the same?
Aooooooo. It wears me out again
I've been lost, I've been found, I've been fooling around
I've been up, I've been down, come on in, take your time
I've been low, I've been high, I'm in love with this lie
So good, It's so good, so good, HA!
It brings me up just to kick me down
It'll fix me up, just to kick me down
Kick it, kick it, kick it up
Well bring me down oh yeah yeahEmbed
