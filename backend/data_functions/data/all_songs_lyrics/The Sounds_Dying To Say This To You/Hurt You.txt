Hurt You LyricsDon't want hurt you
Try not to mess with your feelings
It's just a matter of trust, for us, for lust
Don't want hurt you
Try not to fuck with your feelings
It's just a matter of trust, for us, for lust
You should come over
Cause I can tell from your eyes
Why won't you tell me what's really on your mind
Too much confusion
You need a little more time
So many times now we've been through this before
Don't want hurt you
Try not to mess with your feelings
It's just a matter of trust, for us, for lust
Don't want hurt you
Try not to fuck with your feelings
It's just a matter of trust, for us, for lust
Can we start over
Or should I leave you behind?
Give me an answer
But please don't tell me the truth
What's your solution?
You can't make up your mind
This is my answer, you know I wanna leave
Don't say you just wanna go!
Don't you know you're on your own?
Don't say you just wanna go!
Don't you know you're on your own?
Don't want hurt you
Don't want hurt you
Try not to mess with your feelings
It's just a matter of trust, for us, for lust
Don't want hurt you
Try not to fuck with your feelings
It's just a matter of trust, for us, for lust
Don't say you just wanna go!
Don't you know you're on your own?
Don't say you just wanna go!
Don't you know you're on your own?
Don't want hurt you
Don't want hurt you
Try not to mess with your feelings
Don't say you just wanna go
Don't want hurt you
Don't want hurt you
Try not to mess with your feelings
Don't say you just wanna go
Don't want hurt you
Don't want hurt you
Try not to fuck with your feelings
Don't say you just wanna goEmbed
