Night After Night (Alternative Version) LyricsIt all seem perfect
But there are moments when I feel nothing at all
Same as always
Now it's repeating itself all over again
Night after night you say you'll move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Don't feel sorry
Cos' there's no reason for us to fight anymore
Tears are coming and years are going
I hope we learned something
Night after night you say you'll move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Night after night you say you move on
Tomorrow, tomorrow
Now, what's holding you back?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't knowEmbed
