Tony the Beat LyricsHey, let's kick it
Stop, just lick it
Let you start it
'Cause 'cause it's so easy
You like it my way
And I know it
So let's do it
Do it do it real good
Ha, it's sweaty
Now, I'm ready
Just take it off
Cause cause you tease me
I like it that way
And I know it
Do it do it real good
Oh
This song is not for you lovers
Woo-oo-oo
Don't stop push it now
And I will give it all to you
Don't just stop now
And try to give it all up
Hey, let's kick it
Stop, just lick it
Let you start it
'Cause 'cause it's so easy
You like it my way
And I know it
So let's do it
Do it do it real good
Ha, it's sweaty
Now, I'm ready
Just take it off
Cause cause you tease me
Oh
This song is not for you lovers
Woo-oo-oo
Don't stop push it now
And I will give it all to you
Don't just stop now
And try to give it all up
Don't stop push it now
And I will give it all to you
Don't just stop now
And I will give it all to you
Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh

This song is not for lovers (This song is not for lovers)
Wooo-oo-oo
Don't stop push it now
And I will give it all to you
Don't just stop now
And try it to give it all up
Don't stop push it now
Get down and do what you've been told
Don't just stop now
And try to give it all up
Don't stop push it
Stop

And try to give it all up
Don't stop push it now
Get down and do what you've been told
Don't just stop now
And try to give it all upEmbed
