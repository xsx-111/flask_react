24 Hours LyricsFragile, handle with care
You fall in love then you lose your head
For the last 24 hours
Well I've been crying my heart out
This time hoping for the better
Been down seems like forever
For the next 24 hours
Well I'm yours
And the world is ours
You said it was love for the first time
Oh baby baby be mine
Cuz I'm in love in love in love in love with you
It's all good, you don't have to worry
I'm not like that, I'm not in a hurry
Take your time I'm not going nowhere
If you go I will always follow
You said it was love for the first time
Oh baby baby be mine
Cuz I'm in love, in love, in love, in love
With you, with you, with you, with you
With you oh
Would I lie to you?
I've never had a reason to
Something I would never do never do never do
Hey
You said it was love for the first time
Oh baby baby be mine
Cuz I'm in love, in love, in love, in love with you
You said it was love for the first time
Oh baby baby be mine
Cuz I'm in love, in love, in love, in love
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you1Embed
