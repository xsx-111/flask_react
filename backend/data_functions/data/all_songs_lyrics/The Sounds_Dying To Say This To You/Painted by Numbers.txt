Painted by Numbers LyricsCould I act like you, and put a smile on my face
Not even for a second, would I lie to myself
Too many things are missing, and there's a tear in my eye
It's not a question or an answer, but it will change your mind
We'll be the same tomorrow
'Cause we all been painted by numbers
We're dancin' as we borrow
You said it was love
I said I'd like you to be mine
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
I couldn't act like you, but I can love like you do
Between us there is something, I can't explain it to you
We'll be the same tomorrow
'Cause we all been painted by numbers
We're dancin' as we borrow
You said it was love
I got what I need to get by
We'll be the same tomorrow
'Cause we all been painted by numbers
We're dancin' as we borrow
You said it was love
I said I'd like you to be mine
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na
We'll be the same tomorrow
'Cause we all been painted by numbers
We're dancin' as we borrow
Sing a song for sorrow (Sing a song for sorrow)
'Cause we all been painted by numbers
We're dancin' as we borrow
You said it was love
I got what I need to get by2Embed
