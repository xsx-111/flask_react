Youth of America Lyrics
Youth of america
Is living in the jungle
Fighting for survival
With the wrong place to go

Youth of america
There's pressure all around
The walls are coming down
The walls are crumbling down on you

It is time we rectify this now
We've got to feel it now
Got to feel it now, now, now
Whoa

They attack you from the right side
Down the left side
Down the middle 'til you don't know who you are

Stick around because it don't really matter
They'll try to put you
Six feet under the ground
It is time we rectify this now
We've got to heal it now
Got to heal it now, now, now
Whoa

It is time we rectify this now
We've got to save it now
Got to save it now, now, now...
Whoa!

The rich get richer and the poorer get poorer get poorer
Now there's no place left to go
Got to get off this rot
You don't wanna be born here again?
I don't wanna be born here again
Man, this just ain't no existence
Beware of those guys in disguise
We're living in the jungle, fighting for survival
Can't wait much longer, hurry
Ahhhh
Take the risk
Let it expand your imagination
Take it
We have no place left
No place left
No place left
No place left to go
Ahhhhhhhhhhh
They attack you from the right side
Down the left side
Down the middle 'til you don't know who you are

Stick around because it don't really matter
They'll try to put you
Six feet under the ground

It is time we rectify this now
We've got to feel it now
Got to feel it now, now, now
Whoa
