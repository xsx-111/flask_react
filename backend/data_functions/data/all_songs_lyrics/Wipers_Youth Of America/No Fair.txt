No Fair Lyrics
Out of the shadows, blistering lights
Through the hallways of a sleepless night
Every time I turn around, it's there
Take a piece of our lives, didn't think we'd care?
Take away the chore
Take all of that, and more
And now we're crying
It's no fair

Through the shadows, blistering lights
As the dreams of your darkness died
Every time I turn around you're there

Take a piece of our lives
Didn't think that we would care
Now it's no, it's no fair
No fair, no fair, no fair, no fair

Take a piece of our lives
Didn't think that we would care?
Now it's no, it's no fair
No fair, no fair, no fair, no fair
Take a piece of our lives
Didn't think that we would care?
Now it's no, it's no fair
No fair, no fair, no fair, no fairEmbed
