Taking Too Long Lyrics
Didn't realize the sign
Because it was a sign of the times
What was coming from the sky?
You never, ever change your mind

'Cause it's taking so long

Didn't realize the crime
Thought you had it mastermind
What you seek is what you find
There's no one else because you're blind

And it's taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking, taking, taking
Taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking, taking, taking

Didn't realize this time
What is really on top of your mind?
When they're coming from the sky
You never, ever change your mind
Cause it's taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking, taking, taking
Taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking, taking, taking
Taking, taking
Taking, taking
Taking, taking
Taking so longEmbed
