Can This Be Lyrics
Who's makin' such a deal?
That's not the way it feels
Who are you lookin' for?

But you get it so confused
That's not the way it's used

But how long can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?

When life is one big trail
Take it anyway you will

But you get it so confused
That's not the way it's used

And how long can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long can this be?
And how long can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?

When life is one big trail
Take it anyway you will

But you get it so confused
That's not the way it's used

And how long can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?Embed
