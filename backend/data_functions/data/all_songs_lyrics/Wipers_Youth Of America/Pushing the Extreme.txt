Pushing the Extreme Lyrics
Through your mirror there is such vanity
Through the light, it broke to me
Can't explain

So you think your thoughts are free?
While your eyes look so far away
Laughing at the wind vanes

Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme

In your head it isn't what it seems
Why does it have to cause a scene?
Can't explain

So you think your mind is free?
But they'll take it so far away
Leaving no remains

Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Through your mirror there is such vanity
Tell me, what is it that it wants from me?
You know, child, we used to be in it for the same thing
Now it's one against the other
What's this price we've got to pay?

You thought your soul was free?
But they'll take it so far away
Leaving no remains

Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme, hey
Pushing the extreme, extreme, extreme, extreme, extremeEmbed
