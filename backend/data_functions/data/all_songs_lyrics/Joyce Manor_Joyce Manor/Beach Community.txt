Beach Community Lyrics
I lost it all in a beach community
Where it was lost is not all that clear to me
Over the sidewalk, into a slow talk
Call the police
Told me I'm in the wrong town

Wait for your cue cause my scene it ain't over
I torch up your house while your kids are at home
What can you do when you're not getting sober?
It's hard to admit but you're always feeling alone
You're always feeling alone

Just a few miles down as the streets count backwards
I realize it's true
Everything reminds me of youEmbed
