Constant Nothing Lyrics
Hey, wait, cough, count, keep me awake
Low key, happy and harmless, it's so un-alarming
I can feel it coming out of your AC vents

And it just wears me out
Oh, it just wears me out

You'll get nothing and like it
You'll learn to be quiet
It's a wonderful way to behave in the company of someone you can't tolerate
Oh, I'm just
Hold on
I said it like thirty times in a row

And it just wears me out
Oh, it just wears me out
And it just wears me out
Oh, it just wears me outEmbed
