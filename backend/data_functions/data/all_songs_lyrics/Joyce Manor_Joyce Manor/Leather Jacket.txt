Leather Jacket Lyrics
In your new leather jacket, you're somebody else
And it's not nice to meet you in a fortress of self
Thanks to your new leather jacket, we're nobodies now
Pack of cigarettes, I empty out

I miss the way we talked before you went away to school
Now all you seem to say is "Baby, how could it be you?"
I hate the way you're leaning and you're looking at your phone
I hate the way I feel like dying when I'm alone

In your new leather jacket, you're somebody else
And it's not nice to meet you in a fortress of self
Thanks to your new leather jacket, we're nobodies now
Pack of cigarettes, I empty out4Embed
