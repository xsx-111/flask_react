Famous Friend Lyrics
Famous friend, why are you telling lies again?
All your stories start out boring
But I'm laughing 'til I'm crying in the end
We'll see how to cut along the seam
Separate you from the notion that you're something I could never try to be myself
Only for somebody else
In your car I couldn't tell how to tell
So try to be cool

Hated friend, why are you coming round again?
Pissing out your insecurities to people who don't need you now
They've found someone who can have a little fun
It makes you wonder how you ever felt affection for somebody who could hate you so
Oh, I'd really like to know what it takes to say, "I am strong."
I am strongEmbed
