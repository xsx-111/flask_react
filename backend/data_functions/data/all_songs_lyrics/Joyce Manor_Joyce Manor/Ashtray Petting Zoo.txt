Ashtray Petting Zoo Lyrics
I walked in to find what's worse than worst of all time
I walked out to see exactly what I expected to see
You were there
Horrible fingers ran right through your hair
Scabs on everything
Stark white flesh

Gaining momentum and hitting its stride
Nothing to run from and nowhere to hide
Oh, God bless you, ashtray petting zoo

I am sin to write the love song of your life
I came out to see, the sweet song took a shine to me
I walked out to regret it
He will rot there if you let him
I had money riding on your decomposure
Money won't buy me a sense of closure

Gaining momentum and hitting its stride
Nothing but reasons to go for a ride
Oh, God bless you, ashtray petting zoo1Embed
