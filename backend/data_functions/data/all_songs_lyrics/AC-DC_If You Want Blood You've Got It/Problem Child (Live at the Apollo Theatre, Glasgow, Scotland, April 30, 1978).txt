Problem Child (Live at the Apollo Theatre, Glasgow, Scotland, April 30, 1978) LyricsCop this

I'm hot
And when I'm not, I'm cold as ice
Get out my way
Just step aside, or pay the price

What I want, I take
What I don't, I break
And I don't want you
With a flick (of) my knife
I can change your life
There's nothing you can do

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild

Make my stand, no man's land
On my own
Man in blue, it's up to you
The seed is sown


What I want, I stash
What I don't, I smash
And you're on my list
Dead or alive
I got a .45
And I never miss

Just runnin' wild

Just watch your step

Every night
Street light
I drink my booze
Some run, some fight
But I win, they lose
What I need, I like
What I don't, I fight
And I don't like you
Say, "Bye, bye" while you're still alive
Your time is through


(x4)
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)
You've got your troubles, I've got mine1Embed
