Riff Raff (Live at the Apollo Theatre, Glasgow, Scotland, April 30, 1978) Lyrics
See it on television, every day
Ya hear it on the radio
It ain’t humid, but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
A barmaid's tryin' to tell me (ha-ha)
"Beginning of the end"
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late, my friend

Riff Raff
Oh, it's good for a laugh
Ha-ha-ha
Riff Raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Smile a while


Now, I'm the kinda guy that keeps his big mouth shut
It don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't even carry a gun
I ain’t done nothin' wrong
I'm just having fun
Riff Raff
Oh, it's good for a laugh
Ha-ha-ha
Riff Raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half
Smile a while
Do it againEmbed
