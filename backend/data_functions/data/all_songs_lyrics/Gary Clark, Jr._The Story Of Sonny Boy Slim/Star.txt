Star Lyrics
When I was younger
My days looked brighter
When you were around
You made me stronger
When you told me

Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

As we grow older
I become wiser
I won't let you down
(I won't let you down)
I am devoted to see you shine on

Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

Know that you're a star
(I want you to shine)
I want you to shine
Go on and shine (Go one and shine)
I want you to shine (I want you to shine)
Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

They say that they gon' make you
Bigger than what you are
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Some will try to shake you
And some will try to break you
Just know that I'll be waitin'
While you quit chasin' new faces
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

Some will try to shake you
And some will try to break you
Just know that I'll be waitin'
While you quit chasin' new faces

Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star
Some will try to shake you
And some will try to break you
Just know that I'll be waitin'
While you quit chasin' new faces

Everywhere you goEmbed
