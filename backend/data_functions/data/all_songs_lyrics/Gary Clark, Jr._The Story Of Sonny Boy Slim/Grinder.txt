Grinder Lyrics
Well, I been thinking too much
That I've been thinking too much
Seems like everyone's talking 'bout money
So, I've got to get me some
My baby's crying
So now my baby's crying
We always fighting for money
But, girl, I ain't got the time

Grind

Ain't no way we lying
I want my green and gold
Uh, people dying for this money
Uh, might not be around too long
So I'm gone, yeah, I'm gone, yeah
Oh, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, don't know when I'll be home
Just got to get to some money
I got this story of mine
Uh, yeah1Embed
