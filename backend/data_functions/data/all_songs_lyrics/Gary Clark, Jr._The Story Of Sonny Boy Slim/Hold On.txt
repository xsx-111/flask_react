Hold On Lyrics
What we gonna do with you
We got everything to lose with you, so
What are we gonna do with you

I'm not out to steal your money
I don't wanna take your time
I do deserve a little respect, so
I'm gonna get what is mine, 'cause, yeah
Seem like old news, the whole world gone crazy
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna tell my babies, when
They don't understand
My pressure my struggle, my demands,  yeah
Back then, I didn't understand when my pops came home saying
That he couldn't take it, but
It's hard to be a good man knowing that a man's plan
Is to take what you making

Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Seem like new news
Is the old news from a different angle
Another mother on TV
Crying 'cause her boy didn't make it
She sayin' "what am I gonna do?"
"What am I gonna tell these babies?"
Yeah, y'all dont understand
Oh no, y'all don't understand
What are we gonna do with you?

Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Come on
Yeah
God bless your soul, child
YeahEmbed
