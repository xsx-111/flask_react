Wings Lyrics(Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Don't wanna be alone)
New cars, new clothes, bankroll, new stones
Everyone knows so...
We got issues, and people get misused
And girl I miss you, but I know we'll get through
What we go through, everyone knows
So...
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Don't wanna be on display
Oooh Oooh (Why)
Oooh Oooh (Why)
Red carpets (hey), red roses (hey), put on poses cause here comes the Joneses (Joneses)
Everyone knows so
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Don't wanna be on display
Everyone knows
(Oooh, everyone knows)
Everyone knows
(Oooh, everyone knows)
Everyone knows
(Everyone knows)
Everyone knows
Everyone's chasing new faces
Yeah, yeah
(Why, why, why, why, why)
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Don't wanna be on display
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I
Don't wanna be on displayEmbed
