Down to Ride LyricsBaby, I want your love
Baby, I need your love
Baby, I want your love
From the first moment, I knew
I really want to know you
I ain't never met nobody like you
You make me want to show you, the world
I used to feel alone, I used to feel alone
'Til I got you
I used to feel alone, I used to feel alone
'Til I got you
My love, my, my love, my love, my
I wouldn't be alone, 'cause
I got a girl who's down to ride with me
Damn, she looks good on that passenger side with me
No more time to waste, thinking 'bout the past
Adjust that rear view got my foot on the gas, yeah
I got a girl who's down to ride with me
From the first moment I knew
I wanted this forever and ever, baby
Baby, I'mma always be around
'Cause we're in this together, yeah
So when you feel alone, when you feel alone
Baby, just know I got you
When you feel alone, when you feelin' lost
Baby, just know I got you
My love, my love
My love, my love
I wouldn't be alone, 'cause
I got a girl who's down to ride with me
Damn, she looks good on that passenger side with me
No more time to waste, thinking 'bout the past
Adjust that rear view got my foot on the gas, yeah
I got a girl who's down to ride with me
Thank God
I got a girl who's down to ride with meEmbed
