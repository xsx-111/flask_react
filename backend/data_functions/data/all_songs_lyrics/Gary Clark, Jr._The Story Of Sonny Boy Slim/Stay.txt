Stay Lyrics
It’s been crazy baby lately
I’ve been acting a fool
Don’t take it personal
I got to do what I do, Yeah
But every time I see you
It feels like the first time
And every time I leave you
I lose my mind, Yeah
That’s why I need you to stay with me (oh baby girl)
Go all the way with me (ooh)
I need you to stay with me (baby girl)
Don’t just throw it all away with me, Yeah
I never been the type of guy that liked to play by the rules
Maybe you will understand if you could walk in my shoes, Yeah
Cuz every time I see you (every time I see you)
It feels like the first time (very first time)
And every time I leave you
I lose my mind, girl, Yeah (ooh yeah)
That’s why I need you to stay with me (ooh baby)
Baby, go all the way with me (I need you)
I need you to stay with me
Baby, don’t just throw it all away with me, Yeah
Come on, girl, come onEmbed
