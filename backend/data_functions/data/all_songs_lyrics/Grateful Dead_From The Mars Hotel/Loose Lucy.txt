Loose Lucy Lyrics
Loose Lucy is my delight
She come running and we ball all night

Round and round
And round and round
(And round and round and round)
Don't take much to get me on the ground

She's my yo-yo, I'm her string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing

Yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing, "Thank you
For a real good time!"

I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned out all my lights

Round and round
And round and round
(And round and round and round)
Don't take much to get me on the ground
Loose Lucy, she was sore
Says I know you don't want my love no more

Singing yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing, "Thank you
For a real good time!"

Be-bop baby, how can this be?
I know you been out and cheating on me

Round and round
And round and round
(And round and round and round)
Don't take much to get the word around

Cross my heart and hope to die
I was just hanging out with the other guys

Singing yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing, "Thank you
For a real good time!"
Went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love you till the day I die

Round and round
And round and round
(And round and round and round)
Don't take much to get the word around

I like your smile but I ain't your type
Don't shake the tree when its fruit ain't ripe

Yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah) yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
Singing, "Thank you
For a real good time!"Embed
