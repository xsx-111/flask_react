Pride of Cucamonga Lyrics
Out on the edge of an empty highway
Howling at the blood on the moon
Big diesel Mack come rolling down my way
Can't hit that border too soon
Running hard out of Muskrat Flats
It was sixty days or double life
Hail on my back like a shotgun blast
High wind chimes in the night

Oh, oh, oh, the Pride of Cucamonga
Oh, oh bitter olives in the sun
Oh, oh I had me some loving and I done some time

Since I came down from Oregon
There's a lesson or two I've learned
By standing in the road alone
Standing watching the fires burn
The northern sky it stinks with greed
You can smell it for miles around
Good old boys in the Greystone Hotel
Sitting doing that git on down

Oh, oh the Pride of Cucamonga
Oh, oh silver apples in the sun
Oh, oh I had me some loving, and I done some time
I see your silver shining town
But I know I can't go there
Your streets run deep with poisoned wine
Your doorways crawl with fear
So I think I'll drift for old where it's at
Where the weed grows green and fine
And wrap myself around a bush of that bright, whoa, on Oaxaca vine

Yes, it's me, I'm the Pride of Cucamonga
I can see golden forests in the sun
Oh, oh I had me some loving, and I done some timeEmbed
