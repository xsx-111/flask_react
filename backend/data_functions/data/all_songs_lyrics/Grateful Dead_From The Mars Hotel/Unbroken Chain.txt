Unbroken Chain Lyrics
Blue light rain, whoa
Unbroken chain
Looking for familiar faces
In an empty window pane
Listening for the secret
Searching for the sound
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds
Willow sky, whoa
I walk and wonder why
They say love your brother
But you will catch it when you try
Roll you down the line, boy
Drop you for a loss
Ride you out on a cold railroad And nail you to a cross
November and more
As I wait for the score
They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door
A slow winter day, a night like forever
Sink like a stone, float like a feather
Lilac rain, unbroken chain
Song of the sawhet owl
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane
Listening to the winds howl

Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls
Unbroken chain of shy and sea
Unbroken chain of the western wind
Unbroken chain of you and me1Embed
