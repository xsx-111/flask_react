Money Money Lyrics
My baby gives me the finance blues
Tax me to the limit of my revenues
Here she comes finger-popping, clickety-click
She says furs or diamonds, you take your pick

She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

She say, "Money, honey", I'd rob a bank
I just load my gun and mosey down to the bank
Knocking off my neighborhood Savings and Loan
To keep my sweet chiquita in eau de Cologne

She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money
Mama, don't send me down to rob that bank again
I got a notion that you're leading me to sin
Won't you relax, won't you lay way back
Don't you bug your honey about no Cadillac
It's only bucks, you don't need no jack
So won't you please relax and lay way back

My baby's loving gives me such a thrill
It gives me inspiration making counterfeit bills
Now some folks say the best things in life are free
I sure donâ€™t get no lovin' livin' honestly

She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money

Lord made a lady out of Adam's rib
Next thing you know, you got women's lib
Lovely to look upon, Heaven to touch
It's a real shame that they got to cost so much
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
She wants money (What she wants)
Money money, money money money, woo
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money money
Money money, money money moneyEmbed
