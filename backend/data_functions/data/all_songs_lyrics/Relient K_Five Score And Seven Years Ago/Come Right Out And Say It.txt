Come Right Out And Say It Lyrics
I better rest my eyes 'cause I'm growing weary of
This point you've been trying to make
So rather than imply, why don't you just verbalize
All the things that you're trying to say?
Thought this would turn out so well
But I'm beginning to see that instead its trouble
Into a pattern we fell
Of prolonging the inevitable

Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere
Why don't you come right out and say (Come right out and say)
What it is you're thinking?
Though I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear

I better check my pride
Because I was starting to think that I was onto something good
But things started to slide and I sit here in retrospect
Understanding that I misunderstood
Thought I could make up your mind
You had a decision locked up so tight
It couldn't be touched
Thought you were being so kind
By keeping your mouth sealed shut
Rather than just open it up
Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere
Why don't you come right out and say (Come right out and say)
What it is you're thinking?
Though I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear

And I'll try to guess what goes on in your head
'Cause in your mind I just might find
All of those things you left unsaid
And I'll try to make you not regret anything
Later on, after I'm gone
You'll wish that you had listened to me
Had listened to me

Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are gonna hurt were better off this way
Why don't you come right out and say
Come right out and say
What I know you're thinking anyway?
Why don't you come right out and say it?
Even if the words are probably gonna hurt
I'd rather have the truth than something insincere
Why don't you come right out and say (Come right out and say)
What it is you're thinking?
Oh, just what is it you're thinking?
Why don't you? (You, you)
What it is you're thinking?
Though I'm thinking it's not what I wanna hear2Embed
