Sloop John B Lyrics
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we do roam
Drinking all night, got into a fight
Well I feel so broken up, I want go to home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I want to go home, why won't you let me go home?
Well I feel so broken up, I want to go home
The first mate got drunk
And broke in the Captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone, why don't you leave me alone?
Well I feel so broken up, I want to go home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I want to go home, let me go home
Why don't you let me go home?
I feel so broken up, I want to go home
Let me go home
The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home, why won't you let me go home?
This is the worst trip since I've been born
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I want to go home, why don't you let me go home?
I feel so broken up, I want to go homeEmbed
