Devastation And Reform Lyrics
Fear can drive stick
And it's taking me down this road
A road down which I swore I'd never go
And here I sit
Thinking of God knows what
Afraid to admit I might self-destruct

So lock the windows
And bolt the door
'Cause I've got enough problems
Without creating more

I feel like I was born
For devastation and reform
Destroying everything I love and the worst part is
I pull my heart out, reconstruct
And in the end it's nothing but
A shell of what I had when I first started

Usually I'll 'cause my own first hit
It seems to me to be slightly masochistic
But there'd be no story
Without all this dissension
So I inflict the conflict with the utmost of intention
So lock the windows
And bolt the door
'Cause I've got enough problems
Without creating more

I feel like I was born
For devastation and reform
Destroying everything I love and the worst part is
I pull my heart out, reconstruct
And in the end it's nothing but
A shell of what I had when I first started

Thank You, God, for giving me the insight
So I might make these wrongs right
If and when there ever is a next time
'Cause failure is a blessing in disguise
Pull my heart out, reconstruct
In the end it's nothing but
A shell of what I had when I first started
A shell of what I had when I first started

I feel like I was born
For devastation and reform
Destroying everything I love and the worst part is
I pull my heart out, reconstruct
And in the end it's nothing but
A shell of what I had when I first started
When I first started
A shell of what I had when I first started1Embed
