I Need You Lyrics
I've dug up miles and miles of sand
Searching for something I can't see
I've just got bruised and battered hands
And a brand new void inside of me
Complete with walls I did create
From all the earth that I've displaced
A mess that I have made from what
I've just let pile and pile up
I have not been abandoned, no, I have not been
Deserted, and I have not been forgotten

(Whoa-oa) I need You
(Whoa-oa) I need You here, I need You now
I need security somehow
(Whoa-oa, whoa-oa) I need You like You would not believe
You're the only thing I want
'Cause You're everything, everything I need

Explore the cave that is my chest
And a torch reveals there's nothing left
Your whispers echo off the walls
And You can hear my distant calls
The voice of who I used to be
Screaming out, "Someone, someone please
Please shine a light into the black
Wade through the depths and bring me back"
I have not been abandoned, no, I have not been
Deserted, and I have not been forgotten
(Whoa-oa) I need You
(Whoa-oa) I need You here, I need You now
I need security somehow
(Whoa-oa, whoa-oa) I need You like You would not believe
You're the only thing I want
'Cause You're everything, everything I need
(Whoa-oa) I need You
(Whoa-oa) I need You now

When my hopes seem to dangle somewhere just beyond my reach
You say You've heard my prayers
You've read my words there on the beach

(Whoa-oa) I need You
(Whoa-oa) I need You here, I need You now
I need security somehow
(Whoa-oa, whoa-oa) I need You like You would not believe
You're the only thing I want
'Cause You're everything, everything
(Whoa-oa) I need You
(Whoa-oa) I need You here, I need You now
I need security somehow
(Whoa-oa, whoa-oa) I need You like You would not believe
You're the only thing I want
'Cause You're everything, everything, everything
I need You
I need You nowEmbed
