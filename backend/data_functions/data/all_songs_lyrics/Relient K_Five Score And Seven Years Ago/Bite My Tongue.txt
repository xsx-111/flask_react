Bite My Tongue Lyrics
I was going to spell it out in full detail but
I dropped the call before I spilled my guts
But your floor stayed clean, like my conscience will be
'Cause if you heard anything, you didn't hear it from me

I'm sweeping up the seconds that tick off the clock
And saving them for later when I'm too ticked to talk
And I need some time to search my mind
To locate the words that seem so hard to find

Sometimes I say things that
I wish that I could take back
The most crucial thing I lack is a thing called tact
And if you're always so intently listening
Then the smartest thing to say is to tell myself not to say a thing

Yeah, I gotta keep quiet, quiet
Don't let it all come undone
'Cause if I dare open my mouth
It'll just be to bite my tongue
To bite my tongue
It seems I'm always close-minded with an open mouth
And the worst of me just seems to come right out
But I've never broken bones with a stone or a stick
But I'll conjure up a phrase that can cut to the quick

Sometimes I say things that
I wish I could take back
Then the smartest thing to say is to tell myself

To keep quiet, quiet
Don't let it all come undone
'Cause if I dare open my mouth
It'll just be to bite my tongue
Yeah, I gotta keep quiet, quiet
And listen to Your voice
Because the power of Your words
Can restore all that I've destroyed

And when I finally do
Let it come from You
The peace of understanding grips my soul
You're the reason I've
Found meaning in this life
So I'll swallow up my pride and give You control
I give it to You
Yeah, I gotta keep quiet, quiet
Don't let it all come undone
'Cause if I dare open my mouth
It'll just be to bite my tongue
I gotta keep quiet, quiet
Listen to Your voice
Because the power of Your words
Can repair all that I've destroyed
Yeah, I gotta keep quiet, quiet
Don't let it all come undone
'Cause if I dare open my mouth
It'll just be to bite my tongue
To bite my tongue1Embed
