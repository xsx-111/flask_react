Faking My Own Suicide Lyrics
So I've made up my mind
I will pretend to leave this world behind
And in the end, you'll know I've lied
To get your attention
I'm faking my own suicide

I'm faking my own suicide
Because I know you love me
You just haven't realized
I'm faking my own suicide
They'll hold a double funeral
Because a part of you will die along with me

I wish you thought that I was dead
So rather than me you'd be depressed instead
And before arriving at my grave
You'd come to the conclusion
You'd loved me all your days
But it's too late
Too late for you to say

Because I'm faking my own suicide
Because I know you love me
You just haven't realized
I'm faking my own suicide
They'll hold a double funeral
Because a part of you will die along with me
I'll write you a letter that you'll keep
Reminding you your love for me is more than six feet deep
You say aloud that you would have been my wife
Right about that time is when I come back to life and let you know
I'd let you know

That all along I was faking my own suicide
Because I know you loved me
You just haven't realized
I was faking my own suicide
I'll walk in that room, see your eyes opened so wide
Opened so wide
Because you know

Because you know you will never leave my side (You will never leave my side)
Until the day that I die for the first time (Until I die for the first time)
And we'll laugh, yeah, we'll laugh and we will cry
So overjoyed with our love that's so alive
Our love is so aliveEmbed
