Up And Up Lyrics
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Yesterday
Is not quite what it could've been
As were most of all the days before
But I swear today
With every breath I'm breathing in
I'll be trying to make it so much more

'Cause it seems I get so hung up on
The history of what's gone wrong
That the hope of a new day is sometimes hard to see (Hard to see)
But I'm finally catching onto it
Yeah, the past is just a conduit
And the life there at the end is where I'll be

'Cause I'm on the up and up
I'm on the up and up
And I haven't given up, given up on what
I know I'm capable of
Yeah, I'm on the up and up
Yeah, there's nothing left to prove
'Cause I'm just trying to be a better version of me for You
A better version of me for You
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

To be prosperous
Would not require much of me
You see, contentment is the one thing it entails
To be content with where I am
And getting where I need to be
And moving past the past
Where I have failed

But I'm finally catching onto it
Yeah, the past is just a conduit
And the life there at the end is where I'll be, oh

'Cause I'm on the up and up
I'm on the up and up
And I haven't given up, given up on what
I know I'm capable of
Yeah, I'm on the up and up
Yeah, there's nothing left to prove
'Cause I'm just trying to be a better version of me for You
A better version of me for You
Never cease to supply (Me with what I need for a good life)
So when I'm down I'll hold my head up high
'Cause You're the reason why
Yeah, You're why

I'm on the up and up
I'm on the up and up
And I haven't given up, given up on what
I know I'm capable of
Yeah, I'm on the up and up
Yeah, there's nothing left to prove
'Cause I'm just trying to be a better version of me for You
I'm just trying to be a better version of me for YouEmbed
