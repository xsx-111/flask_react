The Best Thing Lyrics
It's been a year filled with problems
But now you're here almost as if to solve them
And I can't live in a world without you now
All my life I've been searching for you
How did I survive in this world before you?
'Cause I don't wanna live another day without you now

This is the best thing
The best thing that could be happening
And I think you would agree
The best thing is that it's happening to you and me

All I wanna have is all that you can give me
And I'll give right back everything I have in me
'Cause nothing ever felt as right as this does right now
I'll go back to before we met, try and erase the past
Try harder to forget 'cause
Nothing will ever be as good as here and now

'Cause when I looked into your eyes
And you dared to stare right back
You should've said, "Nice to meet you, I'm your other half."
This is the best thing
The best thing that could be happening
And I think you would agree
The best thing is that it's happening
This is the best thing (The best thing)
The best thing that could be happening (The best thing)
And I think you would agree (Whoa)
The best thing is that it's happening to you and me (Whoa, whoa)
The best thing is that it's happening to you and me

Always knew (I'd find someone)
I never dreamt (It'd be like this)
'Cause you've surpassed all that I've hoped for and ever wished
And I'm trying so hard
With all my heart and mind
To make your life as good as you've made mine

Oh, this is the best thing (The best thing)
The best thing that could be happening (The best thing)
And I think you would agree (Whoa)
The best thing is that it's happening to you and me
(The best thing is that it's happening to you and me)
The best thing is that it's happening to you and me
(The best thing) The best thing that could be happening
(The best thing) And I think you would agree
The best thing is that it's happening to meEmbed
