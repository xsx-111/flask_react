Forgiven Lyrics
Oh yes, I know this tension that you speak of
We're in the palm of a hand making a fist
It'd be best for one of us to speak up
But we prefer to pretend it does not exist

And you can't see past the blood on my hands
To see that you've been aptly damned
To fail and fail again

'Cause we're all guilty of the same things
We think the thoughts whether or not we see them through
And I know that I have been forgiven
And I just hope you can forgive me, too

So don't you dare blame me for
Prying open the door
That's unleashed the bitterness
That's here in the midst of this
Sometimes we live for no one but ourselves
And what we've been striving for
Has turned into nothing more
Than bodies limp on the floor
Victims of falling short
We kiss goodbye the cheek of our true love
And you can't see past the blood on my hands
To see that you've been aptly damned
To fail and fail again

'Cause we're all guilty of the same things
We think the thoughts whether or not we see them through
And I know that I have been forgiven
And I just hope you can forgive me, too
You can forgive me, too

Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa
Oh, whoa

And you can't see past the blood on my hands
To see that you've been aptly damned
To fail and fail again

'Cause we're all guilty of the same things
We think the thoughts whether or not we see them through
And I know that I have been forgiven
And I just hope you can forgive me, too
You can forgive me. too
You can forgive me, too
You can forgive me
Can forgive me
Can forgive me
You can forgive me, too1Embed
