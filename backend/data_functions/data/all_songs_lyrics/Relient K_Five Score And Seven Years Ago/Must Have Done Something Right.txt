Must Have Done Something Right Lyrics
We should get jerseys
'Cause we make a good team
But yours would look better than mine
'Cause you're outta my league
And I know that it's so cliche to tell you that everyday
I spend with you is the new best day of my life
Everyone watching us just turns away with disgust
It's jealousy, they can see that we've got it going on

And I'm racking my brain for a new improved way
To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say
You're okay with the way this is going to be
'Cause this is going to be the best thing we've ever seen

If anyone can make me a better person you could
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
Came along one day and you rearranged my life
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
I must've done something right

Maybe I'm just lucky
'Cause it's hard to believe
Believe that somebody like you'd end up with someone like me
And I know that it's so cliche to talk about you this way
But I'll push all my inhibitions aside
It's so very obvious to everyone watching us
That we have got something real good going on
And I'm racking my brain for a new improved way
To let you know you're more to me than what I know how to say
You're ok with the way this is going to be
'Cause this is going to be the best thing we've ever seen

If anyone can make me a better person you could
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
Came along one day and you rearranged my life
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
I must've done something right

Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba

If anyone can make me a better person you could
All I gotta say is I must've done something good
Came along one day and you rearranged my life
All I gotta say is I must've done something right
I must've done something right
If anyone can make me a better person you could (Whoa, whoa)
All I gotta say is I must've done something good (Whoa, whoa)
Came along one day and you rearranged my life (Whoa, whoa)
All I gotta say is I must've done something right (Whoa, whoa)
I must've done something right (Whoa, whoa)
I must've done something right (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I must've done something right (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I must've done something right (Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)Embed
