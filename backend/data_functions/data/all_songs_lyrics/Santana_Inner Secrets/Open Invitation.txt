Open Invitation Lyrics
You be you and let me be me
No strings attached emotionally
I want to get a little crazy that's putting it plain
You got the medicine and I got the pain

When you just want to feel good
Like the doctor said
One good dose of loving
Is going to straighten out your head

You got an open invitation
On that you can rely
You got a prepaid reservation
And that's the only way to fly

Let's make love, the feeling is right
Just passing by like ships in the night
Ought to get a little friendly there's no time like now
You bring the attitude and I'll show you how

Anytime you're ready
Anytime at all
Just come on over
You don't even have to call
You got an open invitation
On that you can rely
You got a prepaid reservation
And that's the only way to fly

When you just want to feel good
Like the doctor said
One good dose of loving
Is going to straighten out your head

You got an open invitation
On that you can rely
You got a prepaid reservation
And that's the only way to flyEmbed
