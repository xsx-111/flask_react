Stormy Lyrics
You are the sunshine, baby, whenever you smile
But I call you stormy today
All of a sudden that old rain is falling down
And my world is cloudy and gray
You've gone away
 
Old stormy
(Stormy)

Yesterday's love was alive, the warm summer breeze
But like the weather you changed
Now things are dreary, baby, windy and cold
And I stand alone in the rain
Calling out your name

Stormy
(Stormy)
Stormy
(Stormy)
Come back to me
(Stormy)
Stormy
(Stormy)
Bring back that sunny day
Baby baby baby
