The Closet LyricsI'm in a closet and I can't breathe
Won't you just please release me
I can't move and my kidneys fail
Size of this room feels like jail
I can't talk I can't enunciate
And I'm treated like Sharon Tate
Suburban wealth and middle class wellbeing
All it did was strip my feelings
Personality down the drain
After all who needs a brain?
Take a bullet to my eyes
Blow them out and see if I dieEmbed
