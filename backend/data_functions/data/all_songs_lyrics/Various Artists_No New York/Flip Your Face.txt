Flip Your Face Lyrics
Flip your face over lightly
Roll your eyeballs back all the way
Can I be what you see?
I fill my vacuum up when you blink

I live with the longing
To be melted like butter and spread, oh!
On shiny little eyelids
I'm your makeup, brush me on, please

I can switch you in a second
From eyesore to a fatal disease

I'm just rubber, you can bounce me
Dislocation is the least I deserve
Put the pieces on a platter
Another brand new TV dinner to serveEmbed
