I Woke Up Dreaming LyricsMy eyes are gript, my fists are clenched
My brain is open, my mouth rips
I woke up dreaming, you are my vision
I want to touch you, my fingers shiver
Across the room, under the covers, open the blankets
You're my wound
My wrists are split
My elbows twisted
My shoulders bent
My knees arthritic
I woke up bleeding
You are my razor
I want to touch you
My fingers shiver
Across the window
Under the curtain
Break the glass
Feel the pain
My guts in knots, I convulse
I fall on the floor
I search for pulse
I woke up heaving, you are submission
I want to touch you, my fingers shiver
Across the street, under the pavement
Open the concrete, you're the heatEmbed
