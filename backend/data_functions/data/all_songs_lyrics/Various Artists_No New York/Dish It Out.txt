Dish It Out Lyrics

Sick of being on the losing end
I'm tired, I'm tired of playing the obliging friend
Extort, extort my emotions all you like
I'll lap it all, I'll lap it all up and I'll spit it right back

I wanna dish it out!
Ow! Want your heart for casual wear
Want you to grasp at my straws
And see if I care
I said, I, I, I wanna see some emotion
Not the usual fluff
I wanna be the one to tell you
When to start and when you've had enough
Dish it out!


I am a hopeless case
I've failed every test
And just like that, I got no sales resistance
Now you got me obsessed
I'll preserve you now
And pay you back later
I want to cramp your style, crocodile
See you later, see you later alligator
I wanna dish it out!
Ow! Want your heart for casual wear
Want you to grasp at my straws
And see if I care
I said I, I, I wanna see some emotion
Not the usual fluff
I wanna be the one to tell you
When to start and when you've had enough1Embed
