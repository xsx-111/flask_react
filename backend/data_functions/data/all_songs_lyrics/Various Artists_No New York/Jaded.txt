Jaded Lyrics

I'm jaded, but so in love
Sated, but still want more
My heart's, my heart's an open sore
Won't someone tell me, please
What's to become of me
When my pleasure turns to disgust?
Fades into dust as it must?!
Your every touch thrills me now
Soon, soon I'll feel nothing somehow
Ill fated, flesh tainted
I'll cling to your sweet sting, oh!
Till romance runs dry
Till romance runs dry
While romance runs dryEmbed
