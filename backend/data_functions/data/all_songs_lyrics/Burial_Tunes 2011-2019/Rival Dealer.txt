Rival Dealer Lyrics

I'm gonna love you more than anyone
I'm gonna love you more than anyone
This is who I am

I'm gonna love you more than anyone
Anyone
I'm gonna love you more than anyone
This is who I am
Yeah

I'm gonna love you more than anyone
More than anyone
Anyone
Than more
I'm gonna love you more than anyone
I'm gonna love you more than anyone
I'm gonna love you more than anyone
It's about sexuality, it's about showing a person who you are, and to me, this is who I'm about

I'm gonna love you more than anyone

Sometimes you are trying to find yourself
And you run away always
And that's what happened to me
I've chosen
This is who I am
You know my motherfucking style
We're good to role
Tian di jian
Tian di jian
Tian di jian
I've been watching you
I want to be you
I want to be
This is who I am
This is the best way to go
At night, you can see the city lights brighter than ever
And stars and constellations
And it's breathtaking
The star field is just so spectacular
And one night, I saw something come down to us
Come down to us9Embed
