Come Down to Us Lyrics
Excuse me, I'm lost
(Who are you? Why would you come to me?)

Here we are
(Up here at night)
I'm tied down, in the dark, in my mind
Baby, come on, come on
And girl I know, I know you want
To trust in you, and go in, and go in (go in)
Tonight, do you feel alive?
Tonight, you feel alive
For me
(Come down to us)
I'm tied, down, in the dark, in my mind
Baby, come on, come on inside
In the dark, in my mind

Don't be afraid to step into the unknown
Become one
Don't, don't
(Don't be afraid)
Stars, down
Come on, come on (come down to us)
In the dark, in my mind
(This is the moment when you see who you are)
I'm tied, down, in the dark, down in my mind
Baby, come on, come on (let yourself go)
Come on, come on, don't be afraid (don't be afraid)
To trust you, I'm going, I'm going
Go on...

You are a star, to me, angel, you are, a world
You can say, ain't through gods
Sorry I ran away, just to be only with you
You are a star, there's no one quite like you
Saw myself cry, and I stumble for, have to go somewhere
This love, somewhere
(What you don't do, what you never do; is give up)
Love me, coming down, to me (you are not alone)
There's something out there, can you see all this?
You, star, to you
I'm coming down to you
You are not alone

Without examples, without models
I began to believe voices in my head
That I was a, a freak, that I am broken
That there is something wrong with me
That I will never be lovable
Years later I find the courage to admit that I am transgender
And that this does not mean that I am unlovable
So if this world that we imagine in this room might be used to gain access to other rooms, to other worlds, previously unimaginable
(Who are you? You should come to me)7Embed
