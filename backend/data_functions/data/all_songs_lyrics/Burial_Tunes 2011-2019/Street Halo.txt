Street Halo LyricsDrink my heart
It always possessed you
Show you, show me, lonely, oh me, oh me...
Drink my heart
Drink my heart
Drink my heart
No won't let you, don't know that means
It always possessed you
Show you, show me, lonely
Drink my heart
Drink my heart
Drink my heart
Drink my heart
Show you
Drink my heart
Drink my heart
Drink my heartEmbed
