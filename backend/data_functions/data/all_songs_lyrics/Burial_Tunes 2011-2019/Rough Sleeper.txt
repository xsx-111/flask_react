Rough Sleeper LyricsYou
I want to know, now
If we didn't need
Would I know?
Couldn't love
Shine
I want to know, now
Couldn't know
Just...
Couldn't know
But...
You
I want to know, now
If we didn't need
Would I know?
Couldn't love
Shine
I want to know, now
Now
Now
Stay
Forever
Light
Be strong
You stay
Till the start
You stay
Just
Light surrounding you
Be strong
You stay
Hey!
Be strong
You stay
Stay alive
Stay alive
You stay
Just
Light surrounding you
Be strong
You stay
Hey!
Be strong
You stay
Be strong
You stay
Hey!Embed
