Claustro Lyrics
I want you, I know you want me
I want you, I know you want me
You can't hide, I can see it in your eyes (You want me)
You can't hide, I can see it in your eyes

I want you, I know you want me (You want me)
You can't hide, I can see it in your eyes (You want me)
You can't hide, I can see it in your eyes

I want you, I know you want me
I want you, I know you want me
You can't hide, I can see it in your eyes (You want me)
You can't hide, I can see it in your eyes

I'm ready
I know you want me (You want me)

This song goes out to that boy

Can't you see?
I've got my eye on you tonight
I got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you tonight
I got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you tonight
I got my eye on you
Wanna see, where else do I wanna be with you?Embed
