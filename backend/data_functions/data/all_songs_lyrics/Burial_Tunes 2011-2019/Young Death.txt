Young Death LyricsHey, child
I will always be there for you
Child
For you
Don't cry
Don't fear
Don't fear
I will always be there for you
For you
I will always be there for you
(Baby)
Baby, I'll be there
I'll be there, promise I'll be
(there, for you)
Boy, you are alone
Itchy coo
I'll be there
(Promise to me)
(Close to me) Promise I'll be
I, I, I, I, I promise (promise)Embed
