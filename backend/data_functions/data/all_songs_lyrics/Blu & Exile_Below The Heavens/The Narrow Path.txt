The Narrow Path Lyrics
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy

Picture me sitting in front of eighty-eight keys trying to escape
From a shady place where babies blaze trees on a daily day
Tryna get they gravy straight to floss, Co$$ told me homey watch it
These ladies play dirty games when you get to grinding
Where niggas pitch as quick as Nolan Ryan
Holding iron, blowing smoke, elope in fire, flame spitting
The game is just a way to escape
And our pain is just a way we can relate to folks crying
Finding ways I can make a difference
But fuck wishing on a star
Cause the percentage of getting what you envisioned is small
And the stars barely shine in the city, so we’re blinded
By the man-made bright lights, making my eyes shifty
Feel me out, hear me now, crying childs of the ghetto
Letting go a beautiful sound, it’s kinda falsetto
Hello hell, welcome to L.A. where devils that dwell play
They meddle with metal and letting every shell spray
Until day dawns, I make songs for the long road travelers
And lost souls after us
Spitting lyrics vicious like I’m mad as fuck
Packing up my bags, hopping back on the narrow path that’s planned for us
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul

In this world that I'm living in
I've given into sex, stress, and dividends
Los Angeles, metropolis, city of vexed citizens
Folks that smoke infinite dope, and hope living in
Poverty is probably the less stressed position to go
So we don’t have positions to hold
So we pitch snow and live in the cold in hell
Inhaling, feeling heaven is close
But like roadkill I'm still on this road
Bold as any soldier playing his role
I stroll the streets in the cold
Even in summer heat it gets cold
So we strolling with the heat and it's cold
It’s been a long troublesome road and I'm still traveling
And fuck battling, just managing life is challenging
Though I managed to make it
I damaged the places up in my mind
Like the times of Los Angeles' greatest
Wasting time, wasting lifespans fucking around
I'm spitting deep shit stuck underground
So just dig it, or don't fuck with it
Cause you can't fuck with it
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul

Check it, and I'll be playing "Escapism" by Pete Rock
Hot, watching police plot knocks to get my peeps locked
Smiling as my teeth rot from eating sugar coated quotes
Smoking dope to float away, but hey
The air is nice up there
I swear the feeling's good as chilling with a nice cold beer
We fallen angels rocking halo's like it's priced up gear
And if you need me, just ring me, shit I'll be right up here
Where fear is non-existent
Instead of drifting in a prison, where my mind's restricted
Where my Mom is wishing trying to get her broken promise mended
I'm training to be a seamstress, sewing holes that dreams fit
Fiends bring broken clocks, tryna get their dreams fixed
Ticking, itching, tocking watching, God is watching you
But you rather have a watch with lots of diamonds I've been fooled
By the word a few times, but who cares if Blu rhymes
About hoes or saving souls, they wanna hear that beat ride
I rewind and try to play back the days when they would play stacks
Of 8-tracks to recline, now we blaze sacks
Taking back the feeling hidden in me when we used to smile, remember that?
It's been a while, so I'm blowing off the dust
Brushing dirt up off my nuts, got this feeling in my gut
I'm tryna let it out so if you with me listen up
Listen, listen up, if you with me listen up
'Cause uh, I got this feeling in my gut
What the fuck?
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul
Tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy
Traveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me
I need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go
To get this shit lifted off a my soul

Yeah, what up, X?
Uh, B, the Liberty Project, make money
Wanna send one out to the whole town: Bridgetown
Yeah, DS, Aloe Blacc, Cassius King, Donnie Smokes, Don Ox
 life rocksteady 
And all my folks, K-M to the A-M (Dirty Science)
Once again, yeah, from the SIC to y'all, come on
Uh, yeah, Los Angeles10Embed
