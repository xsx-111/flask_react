Cold Hearted Lyrics
Life is cold, cold is pain
Pain is growth, and every seed that grows, sees rain
And the rain gon' come, it ain't nothing new
But when﻿ it's done, the sun shining through
Life is cold, cold is pain
Pain is growth, and every seed that grows, sees rain
And the rain gon' come, it ain't nothing new
But when﻿ it's done, the sun shining through

I was cold hearted and young, a dumb kid with a gun
Cuz fun days don't last, the last nigga to laugh
So rap fell on my tongue, numb feelings remain
And pain comes and it goes
But my wounds shows the room where my pops beat my moms
Moms screamin' for help, myself hot as the sun
Cold hearted and young, a dumb kid with a gun
That I got from my pops top drawer
When he left my momma twice in a week
My momma lifeless and weak, spendin' her nights in the sheets
With seed killer number (one), seed killer number (two)
Seed killer number (three), got heat from the newborns scorned brother
Blu black hearted and young
Raps fell off his tongue, numb feelings remain
The pain comes and it goes
But my wounds show the tomb that now shelters my boy
My boy needed my help, myself not in the game
The game heartless and young
Dumb niggas with guns cause fun days don't last
The last nigga to blast got shots all in his back
Wrath fell on his soul but in my soul he remains
Pain comes and it goes
But my wounds show the moon shining off of his blood
His blood ran through his moms, his moms ran outside
5 niggas with guns, seed killer number (one), seed killer number (two)
Seed killer number (three), pulled the heat and he was through
Threw dirt on his casket his mom wore a mask and
Still couldn't hide tears years pass her son
Numb feelings remain, pain comes and it goes
But my wounds show the groom that still married my mom
My mom still had a son
Dumb kid with a gun, that I got from my pops
Top drawer when he left
My momma fightin' for years, my momma fightin' her tears
Now she gotta explain the game of her life to her son
But the sun still shines
Nine children and a newborn scorn brother two
Blu, life isn't young
Dumb kid with a tongue, that I got from Hip-Hop
But she left me for you, so I'mma give her to you
Cold hearted and young
Life is cold, cold is pain
Pain is growth, and every seed that grows, sees rain
And the rain gon' come, it ain't nothing new
But when﻿ it's done, the sun shining through
Life is cold, cold is pain
Pain is growth, and every seed that grows, sees rain
And the rain gon' come, it ain't nothing new
But when﻿ it's done, the sun shining through11Embed
