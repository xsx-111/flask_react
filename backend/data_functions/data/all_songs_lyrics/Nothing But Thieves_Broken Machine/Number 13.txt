Number 13 Lyrics
Oh, you're bringing me down to my knees
First I'm your predator then I'm the prey
Give me your love and then take it away
And from there you're so easy to please
Give me a kiss like a kick in the teeth
My bloody lip never tasted so sweet, oh
Give me a kiss like a kick in the teeth
My bloody lip never tasted so sweet, hey

You're my number 13, honey

So sweet, my beauty queen
There's something about your love
That makes me wanna kill it
My 13, woo
There's something about your love
Your l-l-l-love

And it's all in the way that you talk
Start with a whisper and end with a shout
Give me a kiss and then spit in my mouth, yeah
You're my number 13, honey

So sweet, my beauty queen
There's something about your love
That makes me wanna kill it
My 13, woo
There's something about your love
Your l-l-l-love


So sweet, my beauty queen
There's something about your love
That makes me wanna kill it
My 13
There's something about your love
Your l-l-l-love9Embed
