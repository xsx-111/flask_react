Particles Lyrics
It's been like a year since I've been home
Flirting with an addiction I can't shake off
My mouth is dry, I self medicate
This comedown won't cure itself

It's driving you away
It's driving you away
Piece by piece
Day by day

Baby, tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange
My particles
I will for you
My particles
I will for you

And I'm a shadow of a ghost
It's feeling as if somebody has taken host
Babe, I don't wanna make a scene
But I get self-destructive
And it's driving you away
It's driving you away
Piece by piece
Day by day

Baby, tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange
My particles
I will for you

Oh, doctor please
This don't feel right
Oh, can you give me something
To get me through the night?
Oh, if it all falls apart
And if this thing goes wrong
Oh, put me back together
However you want
My mind plays tricks
And I don't sleep no more
And doctor, please
I can't switch off
Baby, tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange
My particles
I will for you
My particles
I will for you22Embed
