Stuck on You (Demo) Lyrics
This ain't living it's just passing time
The clock is always ticking in my mind
And it's so frustrating
So much waiting for you
A glimpse of heaven in a living hell
Until I'm with you I am just a shell
And I'm so fixated
I love to hate it, do you?

Forever stuck on you
I'm fucking stuck on you
Forever stuck on you
I'm fucking stuck on you
Yeah I can't shake you

I used to hate you but I changed my mind
You overwhelm me and I don't know why
But now you got me
I need this folie Ã  deux

Forever stuck on you
I'm fucking stuck on you
Forever stuck on you
I'm fucking stuck on you
Yeah I can't shake you
Yeah I can't shake you
Forever stuck on you
I'm fucking stuck on you
Forever stuck on you
I'm fucking stuck on you
Forever stuck on you
I'm fucking stuck on you
I can't shake you
I can't shake you

This ain't living it's just passing time2Embed
