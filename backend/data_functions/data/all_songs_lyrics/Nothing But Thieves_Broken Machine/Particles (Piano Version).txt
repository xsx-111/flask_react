Particles (Piano Version) Lyrics
It's been like a year since I've been home
Flirting with an addiction I can't shake off
My mouth is dry, I self medicate
This comedown won't cure itself
It's driving you away
It's driving you away
Piece by piece
Day by day

Baby
Tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange my particles
I will for you
My particles, I will for you

And I'm the shadow of a ghost
And then as if somebody has taken host
Babe, I don't want to make a scene
But I get self-destructive
It's driving you away
It's driving you away
Piece by piece
Day by day
Baby
Tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange my particles
I will for you

Oh, doctor please, this don't feel right
Oh, can't you give me something
To get me through the night
Oh, if it all falls apart
And if this thing goes wrong
Oh, put me back together
However you want
My mind plays tricks
And I don't sleep no more
Doctor, please
Can't switch off

Baby
Tell me if I'm being strange
And if I need to rearrange my particles
I will for you
My particles, I will for you4Embed
