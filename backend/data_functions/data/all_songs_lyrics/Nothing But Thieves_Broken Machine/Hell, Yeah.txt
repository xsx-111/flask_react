Hell, Yeah Lyrics
It's just a little bit warmer
Than you're used to up above
It's just a little bit harder
To control the one you love
There's just a little more danger
In the slightest remark
It goes a little bit deeper
And gets a little more dark

Hell, yeah
Why don't we go there?
It's way down below there
It's just like home

In a town upon the outskirts
With a flaw it cannot hide
I made my peace with sorrow
And kept it all inside
It's all inside

They call it “Hell”, yeah
Why don't we go there?
It's way down below there
It's just like home
Oh, oh, oh, oh

They call it “Hell”, yeah
Why don't we go there?
It's way down below there
Let's make it our own
Hell, yeah
We're all gonna go there
It's better than nowhere
It's just like home
It's just like home
It's just like home8Embed
