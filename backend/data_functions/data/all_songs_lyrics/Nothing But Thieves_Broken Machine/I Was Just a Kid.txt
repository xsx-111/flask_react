I Was Just a Kid Lyrics
I was just a kid, I needed answers
I found a screen, promised adventure
Just as I thought I had it all
I pulled the trigger and nothing happened

I was in a dream, I was in heaven
I saw a god, I had a question
Opened my eyes, fell out the sky
Tried to remember, but there was nothing

Then you gave me something
Something to believe in
Yeah, you gave me something
Something to believe in

'Cause I was just a kid
I was just a kid
How'd it get like this?

And the story ends, but life goes on so
Like those before and those to follow
Just when you thought you knew it all
You find another and then it happens
'Cause you gave me something
Something to believe in
Yeah, you gave me something
Something to believe in

'Cause I was just a kid
I was just a kid
'Cause I was just a kid
And you gave me something
Gave my life a meaning
Yeah, you gave me something
Something to believe in

'Cause I want something to believe in
Yeah, I want something to believe in11Embed
