Live Like Animals Lyrics
The TV tells us to be scared
We'd make a difference if we cared
We put our lives all up for sale
We get our truth in the Daily Mail
It's madness
Get used to it
Another unit to be sold
Pig-love is all we'll ever know
So we're gonna live like animals
We're gonna live like animals
It's madness
It's gone to shit

And now the kids are opening their eyes
And now the kids are starting up a fire
Dancing around, dancing around the light

So drink our blood like a parasite
For occupation: socialite
Just looking for another hit
Opinion's what you say it is?
It's tragic
Get used to it
So write your name as you come in
In case we want to kick you out
We're gonna make 'em build a wall
We're gonna live like animals
It's madness
It's gone to shit

If you're a something, don't ask for nothing
If you're a nothing, don't ask for something
If you're a something, don't ask for nothing
If you're a nothing, don't ask for something

And now the kids are opening their eyes
And now the kids are starting up a fire
Dancing around, dancing around the light

So wake up, so wake up
So wake up, so wake up
So wake up
This ain't a dream
'Cause everything's exactly how it seems
And now the kids are opening their eyes
And now the kids are starting up a fire
Dancing around, dancing around the light

So wake up, so wake up
So wake up, so wake up
So wake up
This ain't a dream
'Cause everything's exactly how it seems
So wake up10Embed
