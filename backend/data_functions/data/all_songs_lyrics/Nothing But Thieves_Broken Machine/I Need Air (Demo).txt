I Need Air (Demo) Lyrics
Stuck in a hollow
Somewhere so deep
Down by the water
A drop in a dream
Everything's quiet
Smothered in peace
Sometimes it's easier to sleep
Even the fishes
Know what I mean
Under the water
Trying to breathe

And I need air
I need air
I, I, I need air

I see a vision
Send down a line
Sometimes it's easier to die

And I need air
I, I, I need air
I, I, I need air
If there's something
I can't see it
Show me something
'Cause I need it
If there's something
I can't see it
Show me something
'Cause I need it

I need air
I, I, I need air
I need air
I, I, I need air
I, I, I need air3Embed
