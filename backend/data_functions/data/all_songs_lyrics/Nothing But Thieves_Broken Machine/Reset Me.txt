Reset Me Lyrics
I think it's the time
To hold down rewind
Tear this city down
Concrete makes me sick
Generation beat
Can you hear the sound?

Hey baby, you ok?
Still feeling strange?
I'm starting to think our luck could change
Some people fear the end
But I carry it
It's in my pocket, it keeps me safe

But what if it was simple?
And what if it made sense?
And what if we were living
In a perfect tense?
'Cause what if you reset me?
What if we restart?
What if you reset me
Before it falls apart?
Borderlines are drawn
'Cause of where you're born
Don't you dare protest
Red and white and blue
We'll look after you
'Cause we know what's best

And you can't lose the war
When you sell the guns
Your car runs on oil as thick as blood

But what if it was simple?
And what if it made sense?
And what if we were living
In a perfect tense?
'Cause what if you reset me?
What if we restart?
What if you reset me
Before it falls apart?

Hey baby, you ok?
Still feeling strange?
I'm starting to think our luck could change
Some people fear the end
But I carry it
It's in my pocket, it keeps me safe
But what if it was simple?
And what if it made sense?
And what if we were living
In a perfect tense?
'Cause what if you reset me?
What if we restart?
What if you reset me
Before it falls apart?5Embed
