Get Better Lyrics
I know you think I'm kinda strange
Sitting in this microwave
A party trick no one sees
Victim of a thought disease
Give me just a minute
Give me just a minute
Baby please, don't hang around
I don't mean to bring you down
Give me just a minute
Found my limit now

Am I gonna get better, better?
Am I gonna get better, better?
Because this feels like this might last forever
Will I ever get better?

War is raging in my head
Don't know which side wants me dead
Even if I've lost the fight
You should'a seen the other guy
Give me just a minute
Found my limit now
Am I gonna get better, better?
Am I gonna get better, better?
Because this feels like this might last forever

Will I ever get out of this thing?
A serious lack of oxygen
My poor brain
Eating me from the inside
All out of love
Masks will fall from above
Please attach your own
Before dealing with the others
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Will I ever get better, better?
Will I ever get better, better?
Because this feels like this might last forever
Will I ever get?
Will I ever get?6Embed
