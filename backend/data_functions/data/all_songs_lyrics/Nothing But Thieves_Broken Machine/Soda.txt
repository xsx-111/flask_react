Soda Lyrics
I'm an exception
It's hard to accept
Because I try to be happy
But then I forget
They tell me I need to chill, man
It's all in your head
Maybe I'm paranoid

I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I once had a thought
But don't know where it went
'Cause I've been living off soda
And cheap cigarettes
Maybe when I was a kid
I was dropped on my head
Yeah, that would make some sense, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
It's making me so unwell
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna be myself
Just wanna be someone else
Yeah, yeah, yeah17Embed
