Getting Ahead In The Lucrative Field Of Artist Management LyricsThe name of the game is Ballbuster
It's a family game, fun for children
And for adults, it's exciting
You make strategic offensive and defensive moves
Then try to bust your opponent's balls
It's as easy as checkers, but exactly like pool
You're a ballbuster
Ballbuster, a great new game from Fug youEmbed
