Chaos Lyrics
Ordo ob kao, "Order out of chaos"
And the idea is that, uh
With the influence of powerful forces behind the scene
You can bring order out of the chaos that we see
We know, for instance, that much of the...
...an eerie order underneath even chaos, as if the finger of God
In order and disorder, is always there....
...I think he has nothing to support this
Y-you're so full of it!
Aliens....protecting society how?
Chaos happens, there's too many people here...

Gotta learn the way to turn
Hat over eye
Feeling dead more than alive
Give her something to rely on
One more time

No one hears the sound
Fear is all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby
No way in, no way out
Empty talk and TV shouts
Got to find the way around
No, you ain't no lifer
In this town

No one hears the sound
Fear is all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby

Stop the beat, hear the sound
Time has come for you to speak
Your mind

Can't you hear the sound?
Chaos all around
Turn the music loud
No more lullaby
