Nursery Rhyme / Breather LyricsDoes it mean I never let you know
Each time I turn inside
When I fully grow, I'll outsize you
But I won't let you fall in love
You know it flows over me
And you won't let me drown inside
Sing a nursery rhyme to keep me quiet
Sing a nursery rhyme to keep me quiet
Won't you please stay close to me, close to me
Carry through your ecstasy
You can't stop me breathing
Even when you're on fire
Know that you're weaving
With my emotional wires
Flows through me, in through me, out through me
Over me, filling me, feeding me electrically
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
I have to breathe the air you breathe, I'm inside you
In a room inside a room, I'm inside you
The colour changes follow your emotion
I can see when you're feeling desire
I feel him close to you
While I just walk around inside you
Don't let him close to me
Not when you know it's not the one, the one, the one, the one, the one, the one
The one that you love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
It's electric ballroom love
Keep me quiet
Won't you sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet while you're on fire
Won't you sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet while you're on fire
Won't you sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet while you're on fire
Please just sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet while I'm inside
Please just sing me a nursery rhyme
To keep me quiet while I'm inside
I won't let you fall in love
You know inside, the baby knows
I won't let you fall in love (we're in this together)
You know inside, the baby knows (we're in this forever)
I won't let you fall in love (we're in this together)
You know inside, the baby knows (we're in this forever)
I won't let you fall in love (we're in this together)
You know inside, the baby knows (we're in this forever)
The baby knows (keep me quiet) (we're in this together)
The baby knows (keep me quiet)
The baby knows (keep me quiet) (we're in this forever)
The baby knows (keep me quiet)
You're on fire, you're on fire (we're in this together)
Keep me quiet, breathe the air you breathe (we're in this forever)
Ah, ah
Don't breatheEmbed
