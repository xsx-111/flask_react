Rabbit In Your Headlights Lyrics
I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Scared of the spotlight
You don't come to visit
I'm stuck in this bed

Thin rubber gloves
She laughs when she's crying
She cries when she's laughing

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul
Away

I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
Washed down the toilet
Money to burn

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul
Away

If you're frightened of dying and you're holding on
You'll see devils tearing your life away
But... If you've made your peace
Then the devils are really angels
Freeing you from the earth
Rotworms on the underground
Caught between stations
Butterfingers
I'm losing my patience
I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Christian suburbanite
You got money to burn

Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul
Away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away5Embed
