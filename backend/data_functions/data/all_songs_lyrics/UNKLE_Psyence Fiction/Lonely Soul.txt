Lonely Soul Lyrics
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
Yeah, yeah

I believe there's a time and a place
To let your mind drift and get out of this place
I believe there's a day and a place
That we will go to and I know you wanna share
There's no secret to livin'
(There's no secret to livin')
Just keep on walkin'
There's no secret to dyin'
(There's no secret to dyin')
Just keep on flyin'
I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name
I'm gonna die in a space that don't hold my fame

God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls

I believe there's a time
When the cord of life should be cut, my friends
(Cut the cord, my friend)
I believe there's a time
When the cord can be cut and this vision ends
(Let this vision end)
But I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name
And I'm gonna cry in a space that don't hold my name
(Woo, walkin' in the cold, woo)
Just keep on flyin'
(There'll be a searchlight on the mountain high, woo)
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
God knows you're lonely souls
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I'm a lonely soul
(I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name)
(I'm gonna die in a place that don't know my name)
God knows you are lonely souls
Lonely souls
Lonely souls
Lonely soul
I'm a lonely soul


So long, little chapel
Sweet is the sound
Pack up your light
Pack up your light
Say goodbye to the holy water life
Sweet sound, in and out
Pushing it out
Pushing it in5Embed
