Back To Mystery City LyricsHey little girl, won't you come along
I'm gonna take you to where I come from
It's a place with no heart, a place without pity
It's a place that's called the Mystery City
We're gonna take a ride to the Mystery City
We're not coming back so buy a one-way ticket!
We're leaving right now for the Mystery City
Got no heart, don't want no pity
Hey little girl, you'll love it there
Just backcomb your hair, let's get outta here
We can't stay here, baby this is nowhere
New boys waiting for you everywhere there
There's a lonestar queen, a lonestar queen
She's waiting for me
There's a lonestar queen, a lonestar queen
She's waiting for me
Down in Mystery City, down in Mystery City, down in Mystery City
I know you'd call this a paradise, Dear
People judge you by the clothes you wear
Well, it's a wham bam gangbang everynight there
I tell you everywhere else is just nowhere!
There's a lonestar queen, a lonestar queen
She's waiting for me down in Mystery City
Oh, there's a million girls waiting for me
Down in Mystery City, I don't care
A million girls, million curls, million pearls, million turds
Waiting for me...Embed
