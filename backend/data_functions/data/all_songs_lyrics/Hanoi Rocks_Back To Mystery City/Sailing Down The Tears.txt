Sailing Down The Tears LyricsI hear you calling, calling me on your telephone, yeah!
Saying you don't want to sleep alone...
'Cause you're so scared in the middle of the night...
All night...
I hear you dreaming, dreaming that I will be leaving
But that ain't what I believe in
It's just a distant, that's growing near, in near
It's just the magic in your eyes...
. Keeps me awake all night...
I've been sailing down the tears for so many years
Ain't that enough to prove that I care...
You know I need you, and I'm aware of that you need me too....
We're playing this game, by our own rules
And there's no one to stand in between...in between
It's just the magic in your eyes....
Keeps me awake all night...
I've been sailing down the tears for so many years
Ain't that enough to prove that I care...
I'll keep sailing down...Oh yeah!
Sailing down the tears...
Yeah you know I need you
And I'm aware of that you need me too..
We're playing this game, by our own rules
And there's no one to stand in between
You say you love me, because that is the way
You must feel...
I'll satisfy your every need...
And that's the way it's meant to be, to be...
It's just the magic in your eyes....
Keeps me awake all night...
I've been sailing down the tears for so many years
Ain't that enough to prove that I care...
It's just the magic in your eyes....
Keeps me awake all night...
I've been sailing down the tears for so many years
Ain't that enough to prove that I care...Embed
