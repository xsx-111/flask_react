Tooting Bec Wreck LyricsPeople tell me I'm too high when I'm around, And when I'm not I'm closer to the ground
Well, I do anything whenever I want, And I want to do it here and now
I'm on a one-way street, I can't retreat, 'Cos my mind and I play hide and seek
They want to make a problem out of me, 'Cos they want their own problems unseen
My mind's a gallery of memories, I reflect the history
I'm the sort of case of the human race, That people find hard to face
I'm the living wreck, I live in Tooting Bec, I'm the Cosmic Ted spaced out of my head
I'm the living wreck, I live in Tooting Bec, And I'm equal to anyone I've met
I'm the second door on the third floor, If you've got the key then please unlock me
But hey, don't talk to me, I'm not what you see, I'm not here today, I'm miles away
It's twice as much reality when you're, Face to face with history
Yeah its been a long trip, it made me flip
Now i'm crawling on your bedroom floor
Now i'm climbing up your bathroom wall
And i search i search in this shit i search for the eternal party
Is it in my head or is it in my bed?
Baby, please baby, I said baby is it here or is it there?
What? the second door on the the third floor
Tell me more
I'm the living wreck, I live in Tooting Bec, I'm the Cosmic Ted spaced out of my head
I'm the living wreck, I live in Tooting Bec, And I'm equal to anyone I've met
And I'm better than anyone you've met! I sing la la la la la la la la la
Well i just got back from the outer space, they call me the
Flashing Psychedelic Kid
Cos i'm spaced out of my head
You know it feels so good when i reappear, and its so sad
To see yourself disappear, i disappear, when i disappear
Well its too bad....well, here i go again!Embed
