Malibu Beach Nightmare LyricsI wanna stay in the sun
I gotta have my fun
When the work is done down
The Malibu Beach
And when the winter is gone
I won't stay for long
Just turn the radio on down
The Malibu Beach
I'll find a sweet, sweet girl
That sea pearl
She'll make me burn that naughty girl
All find a skinhead girl
A black Brixton pearl
Oooooh, down the Malibu Beach!
Yeeeeaah!
I'll find a sweet, sweet girl
That sea pearl
She'll make me burn that naughty girl
All find a skinhead girl
A black Brixton pearl
Oooooh, down the Malibu Beach!
Allright! Prrrraah!
I'll find a sweet, sweet girl
That sea pearl
She'll make me burn that naughty girl
All find a skinhead girl
A black Brixton pearl
Oooooh, down the Malibu
Down the Malibu
Down the Malibu Beach!
Gonna take a holiday
Down Malibu Beach, thats what I'll do!Embed
