Lick Summer Love LyricsI can see by the way you walk you've never been with a man before
And I can see by the way you look at me that you'd like to try it with me
I've got some news for you baby, I think your time has come
Hot, hot news for you honey, this time I won't let you run
One of these nights, one of these hot summer nights
I will be calling on you, will you come?
I'll send my message in perfumed letters, you can't resist me
The damage has to be done
You've got to come right in you better come right in
And I'll come deep in where no one's ever been
Come right in you better come right in
And I'll come deep in where no one's ever been
Lonely days, lonely nights made me think I'll never ever survive
I've got to get you for any price, I can't get you off my mind, how hard I try
I'll be your guardian angel, I'll never let you down
I'm maybe a total stranger but I'll get you in the long run
You've got to come right in you better come right in
And I'll come deep in where no one's ever been
Come right in you better come right in
And I'll come deep in where no one's ever been
If you try me once you'll come running for more
If you try me once you'll come running for more
"If you try him once you'll come running for more!"
One of these nights, one of these hot, crazy summer nights
I'll lick the sweet summer sweat from your hips
You may not like it yet but I bet you'll get wet
It'll be worth every tear you've shedEmbed
