Until I Get You LyricsFor your love I'd give anything
For your time stars above
And if I ever get you I'll never let you go
Don't deny, you have seen me before
Realize, look me in the eye just a while
I got love 'n I won't hide it
Now when I finally found it
Hey you hey you where did you come from?
From supermarket corridor?
Hey you, hey you what's going on?
While I turn my head away you had gone the other way
Away, oh there she walks again
I have to be her boyfriend
Hey you, it's true, Baby, there I stood
When I looked her in the eye
She gave me her sweet sweet smile
Don't deny, you have seen me before
Realize, look me in the eye just a while
I got love 'n I won't hide it
Now when I finally found it
I've seen you many times before
For each time you mean more
I'd like to be always yours
So it's up to you
Please take me home with you
You, you're the sweetest thing
For you I'd give anything
If you're a dream
Then let me sleep forever
Until I get you...
I'll be dreaming of you every night
And all of my timeEmbed
