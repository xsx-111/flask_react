I Need Somebody Lyrics
Well, I am your crazy driver
Honey, I'm sure to steer you wrong
I am dying in a story
I'm only living to sing this song
(Just the same, baby)

I need somebody, baby
I need somebody, too
I need somebody, baby
Just like you, just like you, just like you

Well, I'm losing all my feelings
And I'm running out of friends
You know you lied to me in the beginning
Baby, and now you're gonna try to bring me
Try to bring me to the end

I need somebody, baby
I need somebody, too
I need somebody, baby
Just like you, just like you, just like you
Well, now it's time to leave this signal
The interference is too strong
Yeah, I got my reputation
Ride them airwaves, now too long

I need somebody, baby
I need somebody, too
I need somebody, baby
Just like you, just like you, just like you3Embed
