Raw Power Lyrics
Dance to the beat of the livin' dead
Lose sleep, baby, and stay away from bed
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you
If you're alone and you got the fear
So am I, baby, let's move on outta here
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you

Raw power got a magic touch
Raw power is a-much too much
Happiness is a-guaranteed
It was made for you and me

Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power, it can't be beat
Poppin' eyes and a-flashin' feet

Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Everybody always tryin' to tell me what to do

Look in the eyes of a savage girl
Fall deep in love in the underworld
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you
If you're alone and you got the shakes
So am I, baby, and I got what it takes
Raw power is sure to come a-runnin' to you

Raw power got a healin' hand
Raw power can destroy a man
Raw power is a-more than soul
Got a son called rock'n'roll

Raw power, honey, just won't quit
Raw power, I can feel it
Raw power, honey, can't be beat
A-get down, baby, and kiss my feet

Everybody always tryin' to tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do
Everybody always tryin' to tell me what to do
Don't you try, don't you try to tell me what to do

Raw power's got no place to go
Raw power, honey, it don't want to know
Raw power is a guaranteed OD
Raw power is a-laughin' at you and me
Here's what I wanna know:
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Oh, honey, feel it
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it? Ow!
Can you feel it?
Raw power (x4)
Can you feel it?
Feel it
Raw power (x6)
Can you feel it, baby?3Embed
