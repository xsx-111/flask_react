Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell LyricsAwwright! Woooohhhh!
A pretty face and a dirty look
Knew right away that I'd have to get my hooks in you
A-yeah yeah yeah
I'm running low on memories
If you wanna make a buck, boy you gotta be a tease, uh huh
I say yeah yeah
I need it all, baby, that's no lie
I need a lover with an alibi
I wanna fall into a love so sweet
Honey baby baby, I'm hard to beat
Hot flesh and a touch of bone
Smells in the air but I'm feeling so alone, uh huh
I say yeah yeah
Hallucination true romance
I needed love but I only lost my pants, uh huh
And that ain't all
I'll tell ya honey, it's a crying shame
All the pretty girls, well they look the same
I wanna fall into a love so sweet
Honey baby baby, I'm hard to beat
Your pretty face is going to hell
Your pretty face is going to hell
Honey, honey, I can tell
Your pretty face is going to
Hell!
That's right, baby!
Hell!
A pretty face and a dirty look
I knew right away that I had to get my hooks in you
I say yeah yeah
I'm running low on a-memories
If you wanna make a buck, boy, you gotta be a tease, uh huh
And that ain't all
Ooh!
I need it all, baby, that's no lie
I need a lover with an alibi
I wanna fall into a loving sweet
Honey baby baby, I'm hard to beat
Wooo! Yeah! Hey!
Your pretty face is going to hell
Your pretty face is going to hell
Honey, honey, I can tell
Your pretty face is going to hell!2Embed
