Penetration LyricsPenetrate
Penetrate me
So fine
So fine
So fine
I get excitement
I get excited
I'm alone
So fine
Pull a line
Every night at town
Every night at town
I'm going now
Going now
I pulsate
Purify me
Purify me
Take a lay
Take away
Paralyze

Penetration
Come and take me (baby, baby)
Come and take me (baby, baby)
I'm alive (baby, baby)
I'm alive
I'm alive (baby, baby)
Stick it hard, babe (baby, baby)
Stick it hard (baby, baby)
Purify (baby, baby)
Exetice
Penetrate (baby, baby)
Penetration (baby, baby x2)
Penetration (baby, baby x2)
Penetration (baby, baby x2)
Penetration (baby, baby x2)Embed
