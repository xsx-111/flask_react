Gimme Danger Lyrics
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel with you at ease
Gimme danger, little stranger
And I feel your disease

There's nothing in my dreams
Just some ugly memories
Kiss me like the ocean breeze

Now, if you will be my lover
I will shiver and sing
But if you can be my master
I will do anything

There's nothing left alive
But a pair of glassy eyes
Raise my feelings one more time

Find a little stranger
Find a little stranger
Say you're gonna feel my hand
Say, gotta gimme danger, wild little stranger
Honey, gonna feel my hand
Swear, you gonna feel my hand
Swear, you gonna feel my hand
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Little stranger
Gimme danger
Gimme danger
Gotta feel me
Gotta feel me
