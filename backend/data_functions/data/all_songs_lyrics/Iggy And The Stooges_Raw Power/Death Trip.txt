Death Trip Lyrics
Honey, honey
Alright
A girl will steer you wrong
A song can drive you blind
I move to master my machine
And I will not stand in line
Sick boy, sick boy, going wrong
Memory losing grip
Baby, I wanna take you out with me
Come along on my death trip
Come on my death trip
Honey honey, honey my death trip

Tell me, do you care for me?
Once I cared for you
Honey, come and be my enemy so I can love you true
A sick boy, sick boy, fading out, learning to be cruel
Baby, whip me in the heat
Turn me loose on you
Loose on you, honey, loose on you
Honey, loose on you, honey, loose on you

Turn me, turn me loose on you
Turn me, baby, loose on you
Turn me
Said I'm with you, you're with me
Honey, we're going down in history 
We're going down 
Blow my cool, bite my lip
See me through on my death trip
Free this slave, hear me sing
You can save me, everything

Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me 
I say I'll stick you, you stick me
Say I'll rip you, you rip meEmbed
