Music for Money LyricsMusic for money
Gibsons for gain
Bennies for roadies
Fenders for fame
Music for money
Busking for bucks
Greeedin' for greenies
Singing for sucks
Oh yeah
Music for money
Isn’t it queer
Handsome promotion
No ----- here
Music for money
Bleeding for bucks
Quippin' for rabble
Fakin’ for fucks
Oh yeah
Muzak
Music for money
Opportunity is a knockin'
Leave to it me
Music for moneyEmbed
