Shake and Pop Lyrics
They went and cut the record, the record hit the chart
And someone in the newspaper said it "was art"
Disco Cassanova said "it's heavy on the riff"
The local teeny bopper band was playin' it to death

Shake and pop, shake and pop
Shake and pop, shake and pop

The telephones are ringing, the boys are getting hot
They're jetting out to Rio and some other sunny spots
Some senoritas say "The singers sound terrific"
Their personal appearances are stopping the shops


Hey long distance its a rock and roll romance
CBS is going to pay a great big advance
Hey Atlantic come on take chance
Arista say they "love you but the kids can't dance to it"

They cut another record, it never was a hit
And someone in the newspaper said it "was shit"
The drummer is a bookie, the singer is a whore
The bass player's selling clothes he never would have wore
