Little Hitler Lyrics
Little Hitler, what you doin'?
Is the passion inflamed again?
And Little Hitler, where you goin'?
Is it go-go night again, tonight?
Ever searchin' for the action
But the action don't want to know
I've said all along you're a tough one
Little Hitler
Little Hitler, what's the matter now
Can't you settle for the center of attention?
Little Hitler, now I'm serious
Let me guess, why you knocked me off the guest list

As the world turns at the edge of night
And the seed are shot and sown
I'll make a little Hitler of my own
Little Hitler
When the goin' gets tough
Tough get goin'
Every now and then
I can see them runnin', runnin'
You can talk to them
You can be shot with them
But you'll get no change
Only shootin' at 'em, long range
As the world turns at the edge of night
And the seed are shot and sown
I'll make a little Hitler of my own
Little Hitler
See you someday soon
Little Hitler
Selfish pleasure, yeah
Little Hitler
With the one I love
Little Hitler
And you're not alone my darling go again
(Little Hitler)
It's the one I shake
Little Hitler
Little Hitler, now
Little HitlerEmbed
