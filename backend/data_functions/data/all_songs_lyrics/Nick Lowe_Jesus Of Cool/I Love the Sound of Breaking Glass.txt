I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass LyricsI love the sound of breaking glass
Especially when I'm lonely
I need the noises of destruction
When there's nothing new
Oh nothing new, sound of breaking glass
I love the sound of breaking glass
Deep into the night
I love the sound of its condition
Flying all around
Oh all around, sound of breaking glass
Nothing new, sound of breaking glass
Oh all around, sound of breaking glass
Nothin' new, sound of breakin' glass
Safe at last, sound of breaking glass
I love the sound of breaking glass
Deep into the night
I Iove the work on it can do
Oh a change of mind
Oh change of mind, sound of breaking glass
All around, sound of breaking glass
Nothing new, sound of breaklng glass
Breaking glass, sound of breaking glass
Sound of breaking glassEmbed
