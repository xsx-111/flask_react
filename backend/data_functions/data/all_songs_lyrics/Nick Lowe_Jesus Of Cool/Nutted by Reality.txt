Nutted by Reality LyricsWell I heard they castrated Castro
I heard they cut off everything he had
What a dirty low down thing to do
To mess him up like that
They dumped him in a jungle
In the land of the sugar cane
Ever since the day they fiddled around
I said he ain’t never been the same
I say Oooh-La
I say Oooh-La
I say Oooh-La
Well I heard they castrated Castro
Because he was the people’s friend
They told him once and they told him twice
Said I ain’t gonna tell you again
They put a bit of pressure on him
That’s when he told them what they could do
So the word came down from a northern town
"Set up a jungle rendezvous"
I say Oooh-La
I say Oooh-La
We say Oooh-La
He had been livin’ in a different world
Then he was nutted by reality
He had been living in another tree
Then he flew down
To see what happened
I went out to see my sister
She was not in
So I went and bought a paper
Then I returned
She was well into the racing
On the TV
She has never been that fond of me
I went and turned her over
See I’d been livin’ in a different world
Then I was nutted by reality
I had been living in another tree
Then I flew down
To see what happens
I was listening to an echo
I was impressed
Even though I couldn’t see it
It was the most
I was jumping and a-gleeing at every one
I was speaking in a foreign tongue
My pleasure gave no pleasure
See I’d been livin’ in a different world
Then I was nutted by reality
I had been barking up another tree
Then I flew down
To see what happened3Embed
