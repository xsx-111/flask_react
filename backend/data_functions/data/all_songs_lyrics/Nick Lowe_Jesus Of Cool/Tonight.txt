Tonight LyricsDo do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do
What a fabulous night
Look at the moon
And stars are shinin' bright
It's a wonderful night, all right
Oh, it's so heavenly
I could almost believe
It was made especially
Tonight
There's a place that I know
A secret place where I sometimes go
If you wanna know where, we'll go there
So don't hesitate, 'cause although we're late
We stll carry all the fears
Tonight (Tonight)
There will be no sorrow
Tonight (Tonight)
Don't think about tomorrow
Tonight we'll do what must be done
So we won't be the only ones
Tonight (Tonight)
How can we fail to fall?
Tonight (Tonight)
It's really magical/
Tonight we're just a boy and girl
The only people in the world tonight
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, ooh-ooh-ooh, do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
La la la, la la la la
Oh, it's so heavenly
I could almost believe
It was made especially
Tonight (Tonight)
There will be no sorrow
Tonight (Tonight)
Don't think about tomorrow
Tonight we're just a boy and girl
The only people in the world
Tonight (Tonight)
How can we fail to fall?
Tonight (Tonight)
It's really magical
Tonight we'll do what must be done
So we won't be the only ones tonight
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, do do
Do do do do, do do do do
Do do do do, ooh-ooh-ooh, do do do
Do do do do, do do do do
La la la, la la la laEmbed
