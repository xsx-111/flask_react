No Reason LyricsLittle dariin' don't look away
You don't have to be sad anymore
'Cause
There ain't no reason
No single reason in the world
Little darlin' please dry your eyes this time
Don't you be sad to me
Like you did before
'Cause
There ain't no reason
No single reason in the world
Little darlin' I can understand your pain
There's too much confusion goin' round
And
There ain't no reason
No single reason in the world
No reason in the worldEmbed
