Fish On (Fisherman Chronicles, Chapter II) Lyrics
Felt a pang late one afternoon
I was fishin' off Muir beach with Larry LaLonde
Grabbed a tuna salad sandwich and I started to chew
Pretty soon Ler's yellin', "Fish on"
Fish on

I was just a little pup and it was derby day
It was dad and me and Darrell out in San Pablo bay
Taco-flavored Doritos and my orange life vest
Dad caught a hundred pound sturgeon on twenty-pound test
Now he fought that fish for 'bout an hour and a half
Darrell'd say "Jump ya sons a bitch" and he grabbed for the gaff
When we got him in the boat he measured six foot long
I was so danged impressed I had to write this song called "Fish On"
Fish on
Fish on
Fish on

T'was a bright and sunny day, it was me and Todd Huth
Fishin' shark and stingray out of Bolinas Lagoon
Well, hey, hey, hey, I'll be screwed, blued and tattooed
Looks like I got me one of them fish on
Fish on
Fish on
Fish on
Fish on
Fish on
Fish on
Fish on
Fish onEmbed
