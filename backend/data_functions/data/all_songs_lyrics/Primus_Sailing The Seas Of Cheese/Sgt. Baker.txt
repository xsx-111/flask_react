Sgt. Baker Lyrics
Sgt. Baker is my name
I'm gonna teach you how to play the game
Of warfare
Suddenly it appears to me
You got a bit much dignity
For your own good, boy
"Yes sir, yes sir!"

I will rape your personality
Pummel you with my own philosophy
Strip you of your self-integrity
To make you all just a bit like me

I said: right, left, right, left

Sgt. Baker here again
And if you calls me "Puddin' Tame"
I'll stomp you down, boy
Uh huh!
Steers and queers, steers and queers
Where you come from there's just
Steers and queers
And you ain't got no horns, boy
"Yes sir, yes sir!"
I will rape your personality
Pummel you with my own philosophy
Strip you of your self-integrity
To make you all just a bit like me

I said: right, left, right, left
Right, left, right, left
One, two!


Sgt. Baker is my name
I'm gonna teach you how to play the game
Of warfare
Suddenly it appears to me
You got a bit much dignity
For your own good, boy
"Yes sir, yes sir!"

I said: right, left, right, left
Right, left, right, left
Right, left, right, left
I said: right, left, right, left3Embed
