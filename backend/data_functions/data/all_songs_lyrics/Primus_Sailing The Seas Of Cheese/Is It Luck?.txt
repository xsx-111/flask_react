Is It Luck? Lyrics
My socks and shoes always match
Is it luck?
There's a foot at the end of each of my legs
Is it luck?
Well, I can play my bass for you
Is it luck?
Some gals like to kiss my face
Is it luck?

Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck, luck, luck, well is it?

There was food inside your mouth today
Is it luck?
Your barber cuts your hair just so
Is it luck?
Well, you can count to ten and back again
Is it luck?
When the taste of sex is on your lips
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck? Well, hey

Cyanide works oh so fast
Is it luck?
Polyester makes you sweat
Is it luck?
If a graham cracker gets you off
Is it luck?
Love, love?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?

Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck? Well, hey
Said she wanted my body, not my mind
So, I showed her my dictionary
Showed her the words that I know
Not quite desiring to
And how loquacious I can be
When I set my mind down to it
But she wasn't impressed
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
She wasn't impressed at all
She whispered in my ear
She whispered in my ear and she said
"Do you wanna get lucky, little boy?"
Well, I smiled
I smiled and I said

Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck, luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?
Is it luck?Embed
