Those Damned Blue-Collar Tweekers Lyrics
Seen 'em out at Soco, they're pounding sixteen penny nails
Truckers on the interstate have been known to ride the rails
Sweat is beating on the brow, can't keep these fellows down
'Cause these damned blue-collared tweekers
They're runnin' this here town

I knew a man who hung drywall, he hung it mighty quick
A trip or two to the blue room would help him do the trick
His foreman would pat him on the back whenever he would come around
'Cause these damned blue-collar tweekers
They're beloved in this town

Now the union boys are there to protect us from all the corporate type
While curious George's drug patrol is out here hunting snipe
Now they try to tell me different but you know I ain't no clown
'Cause these damned blue-collar tweekers
They're the backbone of this town

Now the flame that burns twice as bright burns only half as long
My eyes are growing weary as I finalize this song
So sit back and have a cup o' joe and watch the wheels go round
'Cause these damned blue-collar tweekers
They have always run this townEmbed
