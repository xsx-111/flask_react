Here Come the Bastards Lyrics
Here they come, here come the bastards
I heard it from a confidant
Who heard it from a confidant
They're definitely on their way
There's one with this idea
Something about a hammer head shark
Nosehairs and flatus
Best keep your distance because

Here they come, here come the bastards
Bury your head deep in the sand
Anonyminity is a virtue in this day and age
Amazing hand dexterity
Flagrant misuse of security
Better run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Here they come1Embed
