Eleven Lyrics
Lie-ie-ie
Lie-ie-ie
I, I, I just can't seem to blend into society
I, I, I hold no hope for this dim simplicity
Of law and order
By whose rules?

I, I, I see no rhyme and no reason
I, I, I hold no hope for this holy treason
Of love and so soft
By whose standards?
By whose standards?

They tell me, they tell me, they tell me
Lie-ie-ie
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me, they tell me all lies
Who is they?

Lie-ie-ie
Lie-ie-ie
Lie-ie-ie
Lie-ie-ie, lie, lie
I just can't seem to fit into society
I, I, I hold no hope for this dim simplicity
Of law and order
By whose rules?
I, I, I see no rhyme and no reason
I, I, I hold no hope for this holy treason
Of love and so soft
By whose standards?
By my standards

They tell me, they tell me, they tell me
Lie-ie-ie
They tell me, they tell me, they tell me, they tell me all lies
Who is they?

Lie-ie-ie
Lie-ie-ie
