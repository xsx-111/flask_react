Tommy the Cat Lyrics
Well, I remember it as though it were a meal ago
Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have nestled its way into his mighty throat
Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine
Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator
Tommy the cat had many a story to tell
But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did

Well, she came sliding on down the alleyway like butter drippin' off a hot biscuit
The aroma, the mean scent, was enough to arouse suspicion in even the oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days
The sight was beyond belief
Many a head snapped for double, even triple takes as this vivacious feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out
They hung out in droves
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place and that was O'Malley's Alley

The air was thick with catcalls, no pun intended
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered straight to behind the alleyway
She knew what she wanted
She was looking for that stud bull
She was looking for that He-cat
And that was me
Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee
