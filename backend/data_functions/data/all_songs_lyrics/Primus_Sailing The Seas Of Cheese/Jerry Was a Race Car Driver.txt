Jerry Was a Race Car Driver Lyrics
Fire it up, man!

Jerry was a race car driver
He drove so goddamned fast
Never did win no checkered flags
But he never did come in last
Jerry was a race car driver
He'd say "El Sob number one"
With a Bocephus sticker on his 442
He'd light 'em up just for fun

Ah
Ah

Captain Pierce was a fireman
Richmond engine number three
I'll be a wealthy man when I get a dime
For all the things that man he taught to me
Captain Pierce was a strong man
Strong as any man alive
Stuck in his craw that they made him retire
At the age of sixty-five
Ah
Ah

Go!
Heh, heh, heh, heh
Dog will hunt!


Ah
Ah

Jerry was a race car driver
Twenty-two years old
One too many cold beers one night
And wrapped himself around a telephone pole, go!7Embed
