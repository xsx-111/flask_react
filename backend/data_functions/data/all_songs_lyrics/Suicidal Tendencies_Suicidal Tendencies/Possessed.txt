Possessed Lyrics
When I go down the street
The people watch me shiver and shake
I'm a prisoner of a demon
I think my head's about to break
It stays with me wherever I go
I can't break away from its hold
This must be my punishment
For selling my soul

Too much pressure, my pulse is rising
My heart is pounding, my head really hurts
I can't take it, all this pressure
From all these things inside of me
Everywhere I look, I see them
Everywhere I go, they're at
What did I do to deserve this?
Why won't they just leave my body?

Are they people, or are they spirits?
Do they belong to the human race?
Why do they want me so bad?
Why won't they come out of their hiding place?
I can't see them, but I know they're here
I can feel it in my veins
All this pressure on my body
Is causing all my strength to drain
Too much pressure, my pulse is rising
My heart is pounding, my head really hurts
I can't take it, all this pressure
From all these things inside of me
Everywhere I look, I see them
Everywhere I go, they're at
What did I do to deserve this?
Why won't they just leave my body?

Am I crazy, or am I insane?
Have I already lost my mind?
Is it real, or is it fake?
Or am I in a permanent bind?
Am I in power, or am I a slave?
Who the hell is in control?
Am I still living, or am I dead?
Do I still have a soul?

Too much pressure, my pulse is rising
My heart is pounding, my head really hurts
I can't take it, all this pressure
From all these things inside of me
Everywhere I look, I see them
Everywhere I go, they're at
What did I do to deserve this?
Why won't they just leave my body?
I know I can't keep going this way
I have to give my mind some leisure
If I keep on going like this
I never again will taste pleasure
If they will not break the oath
I will have to disband
I have lost all control
This thing has now taken command

Possessed!
Possessed!
Possessed!
Possessed!
