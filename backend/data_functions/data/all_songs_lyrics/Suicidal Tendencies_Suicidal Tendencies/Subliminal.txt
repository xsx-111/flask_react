Subliminal Lyrics
Flashing pictures on my screen
Shown too quickly to be seen
Does not register in the conscious mind
Propaganda of another kind

They're fucking with me subliminally
They're fucking with me subliminally

Flashing pictures on the screen
Shown too quickly to be seen
Doesn't register in the conscious mind
Propaganda of another kind
Danger (Nightmare)
Doomsday (Nightmare)
Murder (Nightmare)
Nightmare, nightmare
Danger (Nightmare)
Doomsday (Nightmare)
Murder (Nightmare)
Nightmare, nightmare
They'll fuck with me subliminally
They'll fuck with me subliminally
They'll fuck with me subliminally
They'll fuck with me subliminally
Watching TV, I start to cry
For no reason, I don't know why
Could it be from messages on my TV
Which I'm getting subliminally?

They're fucking with me subliminally
They're fucking with me subliminally

Flashing pictures on the screen
Shown too quickly to be seen
Doesn't register in the conscious mind
Propaganda of another kind
Danger (Nightmare)
Doomsday (Nightmare)
Murder (Nightmare)
Nightmare, nightmare
Danger (Nightmare)
Doomsday (Nightmare)
Murder (Nightmare)
Nightmare, nightmare
They'll fuck with me subliminally
They'll fuck with me subliminally
They'll fuck with me subliminally
They'll fuck with me subliminally
Mind control, the easiest way
Sponsored by the CIA
It's a weapon you cannot see
It's propaganda subliminally

They're fucking with me subliminally
They're fucking with me subliminally4Embed
