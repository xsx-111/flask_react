Fascist Pig Lyrics
Tense atmosphere in the air
Riot written everywhere
Riot squads coming from over there
It's time to go home if you're square

Riot squad, bash their heads
Kick their ass until they're dead
I won't be a fascist pig!
Love to fight, what a thrill
We don't stop until we kill
I won't be a fascist pig!

Throw a bottle in the air
Put 'em up to their dare
We'll just laugh while they stare
And let 'em hit me, see if I care

Riot squad, bash their heads
Kick their ass until they're dead
I won't be a fascist pig!
Love to fight, what a thrill
We don't stop until we kill
I won't be a fascist pig!
Get attacked by them, you'll never heal
They'll rob your conscience, your sanity they'll steal
They'll beat your brains until they spill
That's the fascists' favorite meal

Riot squad, bash their heads
Kick their ass until they're dead
I won't be a fascist pig!
Love to fight, what a thrill
We don't stop until we kill
I won't be a fascist pig!

I won't be a fascist pig!Embed
