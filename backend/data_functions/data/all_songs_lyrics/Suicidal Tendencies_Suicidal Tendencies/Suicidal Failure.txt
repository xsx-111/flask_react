Suicidal Failure Lyrics
Father, forgive me
For I know not what I do
I tried everything
Now I'll leave it up to you
I don't wanna live
I don't know why
I don't have no reasons
I just wanna die

I'm a suicidal failure
I've got to have some help
Have suicidal tendencies
But I can't kill myself

Tired of this way of life
My patience has expired
I'm barely just nineteen
But my life, I will retire
I went down to a rifle store
I bought myself a gun
I pointed it at my head
But I couldn't get the job done
I'm a suicidal failure
I've got to have some help
Have suicidal tendencies
But I can't kill myself

Took all my mothers sleeping pills
I jumped off a freeway bridge
I drank three kinds of poisons
And drove my car off a ridge
I beat myself with a bat
Put a noose around my head
I'm overdosed on heroin
But I'm still not dead

I'm a suicidal failure
I've got to have some help
Have suicidal tendencies
But I can't kill myself

Death may not be the answer
It can't be all great
But me, I'm not into living
With life, I can't relate
By some masochistic reasoning
I think that it'll be fun
I want to start my second life now
So shoot me with your gun
I'm looking forward (Suicidal)
I'm really bored (Suicidal)
You wanna die (Suicidal)
Then die (Suicidal)
On the street (Suicidal)
At the game (Suicidal)
At the beach (Suicidal)
At my school (Suicidal)Embed
