Two-Sided Politics Lyrics
I'm not anti-society, society's anti-me
And I'm not anti-religion, religion's anti-me
And I'm not anti-tradition, tradition's anti-me
And I'm not anti-anything, I just wanna be free

Fascist state, no freedom
Unless you control yourself
Use self-expression, lose your freedom
You're undesirable, you go straight to jail!

Two-sided politics!
One for them, another for me!


Kill someone in a war
Get a medal, you're a hero
Protect yourself in everyday war
You're a minority, you go straight to jail!

Two-sided politics!
One for them, another for me!
I'm not anti-Reagan, Reagan's anti-me!
And I'm not anti-government, government's anti-me!
And I'm not anti-politics, politics is anti-me
And I'm not anti-anything, I just wanna be free!

Innocent, never guilty
High-class lawyer, you are rich
If you're poor, must be guilty
Even if innocent, you go straight to jail!

Two-sided politics!3Embed
