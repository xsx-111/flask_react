I Want More Lyrics
In times of trouble, I fall to my knees and look to the sky
'Cause me, me, I want more
The classification of my heart's a sin
'Cause me, me, I want more

Don't wanna pump nobody's gas
I want more!
Don't wanna kiss my boss's ass
I want more!
Don't wanna take the first job I find
I want more!
Don't wanna dig coal out of a mine
I want more!

Slaving in a factory, a different kind of insanity
Feels like I'm locked in a cage
Working like a maniac, giving myself a heart attack
For a job that pays minimum wage

I want more!
Don't wanna work at the golden arches
I want more!
Don't wanna wash no rich man's car
I want more!
Don't wanna be nobody's gardener
I want more!
Don't wanna be a garbage man
I want more!
Slaving in a factory, a different kind of insanity
Feels like I'm locked in a cage
Working like a maniac, giving myself a heart attack
For a job that pays minimum wage

I sit and reflect about all that I've learned and all that I've seen
'Cause me, me, I want more
The memories come and then go away
'Cause me, me, I want more

Don't wanna pump nobody's gas
I want more!
Don't wanna kiss my boss's ass
I want more!
Don't wanna take the first job I find
I want more!
Me, I want more!Embed
