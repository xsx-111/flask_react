I Shot the Devil Lyrics
I shot Reagan!

I shot Reagan
I shot Sadat
I'm gonna shoot you
In heaven, you'll rot

You'll rot in heaven
Hear an Angels voice
You're too bad for hell
Though it's your first choice

Rot in heaven
You're too bad for hell
Rot in heaven
'Cause you're forgiven in hell

I shot Lennon
I shot the Pope
I shot the devil
Now you ain't got no hope
You're gonna rot in heaven
Hear an angels voice
You're too bad for hell
Though it's your first choice

Rot in heaven
You're too bad for hell
Rot in heaven
'Cause you're forgiven in hell


Rot in heaven
You're forgiven in hell
Rot in heaven
You're forgiven in hell

I shot Reagan
I shot Sadat
I'm gonna shoot you
In heaven, you'll rot
I shot Lennon
I shot the Pope
I shot the devil
Now you ain't got no hope
I shot Reagan!
And I'd shoot him again and again and again!Embed
