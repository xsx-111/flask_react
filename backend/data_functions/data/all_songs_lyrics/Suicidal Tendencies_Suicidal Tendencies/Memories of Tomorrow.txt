Memories of Tomorrow Lyrics
B-1 bombers in flight
Trident missles in the air
MX missles underground
Protect us till we're dead

Memories of tomorrow
Cry in sorrow

Push the button
Kiss good-bye the nuclear arsenal
A-bombs flying off their ramps
Nuclear bombs explode
Radioactive people
Search for medicine
Pray for Shelter
Kill for food

Memories of tomorrow
Cry in sorrow

Mass Starvation
Contaminated water
Destroyed cities
Mutilated bodies, ah!
Memories of tomorrow
Cry in sorrow

I'd kill myself
I'd rather die
If you could see in the future
You'd know why
