I Saw Your Mommy Lyrics
Yesterday, as I went out the house
I saw a body lying down quiet as a mouse
Lying face down in the sewer
I got up closer and realized that I knew her
All her organs coming from her insides
Slashed up skin, sliced up hide
Turned her over and saw the tar tracks on her head
That's when I realized she was dead

I saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead

Twisted body, chopped-off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead can't do no harm
Gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent

I wonder how much you had to pay
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way
I saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead
I watched her as she bled
Chewed-off toes on her chopped-off feet
I took a picture 'cause I thought it was neat
But the thing I liked seeing the best
Was the rodents using her hair as a nest

I saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead
I saw your mommy, and your mommy's dead

Twisted body, chopped-off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead can't do no harm
Gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent

I know it's your allowance that you'll really miss
But make it look good at her funeral and give her little kiss

I saw your mommy,and your mommy's dead
I saw her lying in a pool of red
I think it's the greatest thing I'll ever see
Your dead mommy lying in front of me
I'll always remember her lying dead on the floor
I hope she dies twenty times more
I saw your mommy, and your mommy is dead
I saw your mommy, and your mommy is dead

Twisted body, chopped-off feet
Her body was minced meat
Bugs crawling on her arms
She's dead can't do no harm
Gnarled-up legs, broken and bent
Her last breath has been spent

I wonder how much you had to pay
To get your mom killed in such a bloody way (Ah!)4Embed
