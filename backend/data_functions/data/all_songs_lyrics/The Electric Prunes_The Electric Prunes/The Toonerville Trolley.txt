The Toonerville Trolley LyricsMantz-Tucker
In daddy's day he walked to school
And lived his life by the golden rule
And chopped down timber for his fuel
In daddy's day
His shoe were made by Buster Brown
He'd hide and roll his knickers down
The world was square, it wasn't round
In daddy's day
He'd ride the Toonerville Trolley, the Toonerville Trolley
Tooting on his licorice stick
The Toonerville Trolley, the Toonerville Trolley
That was how he gets his kicks
Oh by gee, by gosh, by golly
Life to him was oh so jolly
Dad, what happened to the Toonerville Trolley ?
In daddy's day they were so pure
No one had to take the cure
For being wildly insecure
In daddy's day
They'd sit and rock and talk a bit
The sun would fall and they would quit
They went to bed and that was it
In daddy's day
He'd ride the Toonerville Trolley, the Toonerville Trolley
Tooting on his licorice stick
The Toonerville Trolley, the Toonerville Trolley
That was how he gets his kicks
Oh by gee, by gosh, by golly
Life to him was oh so jolly
Dad, what happened to the Toonerville Trolley ?Embed
