Train for Tomorrow LyricsLowe-Ritter-Spagnola-Tulin-Williams
You want to know, will the sun keep glowin' ?
Will the rain keep rainin' and the wind keep blowin' ?
Can a man change the minds of men ?
Can you go where you've never been ?
Come ride the train for tomorrow
Will our children have the chance to pray
When tomorrow becomes today ?
There's no use runnin' 'cause you can't hide
The track's too long and there's coal inside
Inside the train for tomorrow
We're waiting for that common freight
Each time that we anticipate
The knock upon our door that means the future of our dreamsEmbed
