About a Quarter to Nine LyricsDubin-Warren
Life begins when somebody's eyes look into your own
Life begins when you get your guy all alone
From morning until twilight, I don't know I'm alive
But I know, love begins at 8:45
Chorus:
The stars are gonna twinkle and shine
This evening about a quarter to nine
His lovin' arms (his lovin' arms)
Are gonna tenderly twine (are gonna tenderly twine)
Around me, around a quarter to nine
I know I won't be late
Cause at half past eight
I'm gonna hurry there
I'll be waiting well lean begins
Waiting for him on needles and pins
And then the world is gonna be mine
This evening around a quarter to nine
I know I won't be late
Cause at half past eight
I'm gonna hurry there
I'll be waiting well leaning begins
Waiting for him on needles and pins
And then the world is gonna be mineEmbed
