Sold to The Highest Bidder LyricsGoing, going, going, going
Gone
She ain't hard to recognize
Dollar signs are in her eyes
Diamond buckles on her little shoes
My poor heart is feelin' sad
To know that once she could be had
If I'd had the price to pay her dues
Sold, sold, sold to the highest bidder
Sold, sold, sold to the gold and glitter
Going, going, going, going
Gone
See the mansion on the hill
The brand new shiny Coupe de Ville
Bought and paid for by the upper classes
The price is going up, up, up
In searchin' for a bigger cup
Her greedy little heart has lost it's glasses
Once upon a long, long time
She clung to this heart of mine
Simple pleasure was her only need
Then a seed of discontent
For her old environment
Turned her gentle passion into greed
Sold, sold, sold to the highest bidder
Sold, sold, sold to the gold and glitter
Going, going, going, going
Going, going, going, going
GoneEmbed
