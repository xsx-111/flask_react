Onie LyricsOnie
(Annette Tucker / Nancie Mantz)
Onie, I thought I knew you
What's happened to you
You're not the same
Onie, why don't you own up
You're not yet grown up
Why play a game
The years will find you if you let them
Don't try to get them before your time
Onie, don't lose what you've got
By being something you're not
Onie, Why don't you own up
You're not yet grown up
Why play a game
Do all the fun things, seek out the laughter
And grow up after your youth is gone
Onie I like you a lot
But don't be something you're not1Embed
