The King Is in the Counting House LyricsMantz-Tucker
The King is in the counting house counting out his money
The Queen is in her parlour eating bread and honey
And in her royal heart of hearts, she's happy as can be
Isn't she ?
Isn't she ?
The King is always working, now signing proclamations
The children see their father's brow knitted by frustrations
But in his royal heart of hearts, he serves his family
Doesn't he ?
Doesn't he ?
The golden calendar reflects a day of obligations
The King and Queen will offer love to cold and distant nations
The children's day goes by so fast nobody's thought to miss them
The golden clock is striking twelve
Now it's too late to kiss them
Though the castle's marble walls don't echo any laughter
But the family portrait paints them happy ever after
But in their royal heart of hearts, they're happy as certainly
Aren't we ?
Aren't we ?Embed
