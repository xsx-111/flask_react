Bangles LyricsUp the stairs your vanity is calling on you oo 00
In the bedroom, the mirror shows you what to do oo oo
You open up your closets and drawers, they have been towaiting for you
You try on everything you own and enjoy the view
Bangles and furs, put them on they're yours
To go with the colors of the diamonds and pearls
They make you happy, but some day you'll see
You got what want, but not what you need
A thousand dollars worth of perfume bottles
And a draw full of diamond rings
Racks of shoes that you'll never use
You click your fingers and servant brings
A truck load of precious jewels from across the sea
I'll give it a thought, is this what you really need
Bangles and furs, put them on they're yours
To go with the colors of the diamonds and pearls
They make you happy, but some day you'll see
You got what want, but not what you need
A thousand lonely nights have shown
How cruel it is to live alone
Money and jewels don't mean a thing
If you don't have a man to bring
The give of a love to surround you every night
To break worldly chains that are too tight
Bangles and furs, put them on they're yours
To go with the colors of the diamonds and pearls
They make you happy, but some day you'll see
You got what want, but not what you need
