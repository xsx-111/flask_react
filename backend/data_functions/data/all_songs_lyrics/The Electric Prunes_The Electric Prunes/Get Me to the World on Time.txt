Get Me to the World on Time LyricsHere I go, higher, higher
Here I go, higher, higher
Here I go, oh, oh, oh, oh
You gotta get me to the world on time
You gotta get me to the world on time
The minute you walk in the room
I break into a sweat
My hands begin to shake so bad
I can't light my cigarette
Then you start walkin' towards me
And my cool comes all undone
If I could get my feet to move
I'd turn around and run
My pulse is beatin' faster
And I'm headin' for disaster
Here I go, higher, higher
Here I go, higher, higher
Here I go
Get me to the world on time
You gotta get me to the world on time
One kiss from you and my whole body
Starts to actin' strange
You shake up all my hormones
You put me through a change
This chemical reaction
Isn't easy to define
You drive me to distraction
You disturb my peace of mind
You got me spinning like a top, now
And I don't know how to stop, now
Is this what love's all about?
Lately I feel so without
Wild sensations
Sweet frustrations
You get me goin' and
There's no slowin' me down
Here I go
Whoa, here I go, oh
Whoa, here I go, oh, ohEmbed
