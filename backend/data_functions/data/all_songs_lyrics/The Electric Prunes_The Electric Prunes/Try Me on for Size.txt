Try Me on for Size LyricsTry Me On for Size
(Annette Tucker/Jill Jones)
I'm not a dreamer, I'm a do'er
Your hopes for escape are gettin' fewer
I know what you need, baby, you're gonna see it my way
I know you're shoppin' around but don't pass up
This good thing you've found
Stop your lookin' baby what you want is standin'
Right in front of your eyes
Try me on for size
My arms were fit to perfect measure
My lips were made to give you pleasure
Girl can't you see I could be your lovin' man, and
Hey girl, tell you what I'll do
I'll throw in my heart if you want me to
I got everything you need, satisfaction guaranteed
So get wise
Try me on for size
(bridge)
Take me home and you'll discover that you'll never want another
Cuz my love's gonna look so good on you
(solo)
I'm not a dreamer, I'm a do'er
Your hopes for escape are gettin' fewer
I know what you need, baby, you're gonna get it my way, hey
Hey girl tell you what I'll do
I'll throw in my heart if you want me to
I got everything you need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Try me on for size
Try me on for sizeEmbed
