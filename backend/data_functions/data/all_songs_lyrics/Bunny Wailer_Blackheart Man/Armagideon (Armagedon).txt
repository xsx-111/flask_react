Armagideon (Armagedon) Lyrics
War, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in I-ration, in I-ration
War, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in a I-ration

In the beginning, there was but one concept
And that's the concept of I
Then arose Apollyon, the Devil
(Satan, Satan)
Claiming that it's you and I
And from that day on, there was trouble
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
From that day on
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
We've got wars, and rumors of wars
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
Nations rising up against nations
(Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
Mother against daughter, father against son (Trouble in the world and the world gone astray)
Little children having children
(Trouble, trouble)
In this war, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in I-ration, in I-ration
War, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in a I-ration

I see light fighting against darkness
Righteousness against evil
Right battling against wrong
Here comes bondage, struggling for freedom
But have patience, I Idren, have patience
Don't be burdened by reasons of tribulations
Have patience, Idren, have patience!
Remember the call of redemption
It says: Blessed art the poor
(They shall inherit the earth)
Blessed art the meek
(They shall have a birth)
Them that hunger and thirst after righteousness
Them alone shall be called blessed

In dis ya war, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in I-ration, in I-ration
War, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in a I-ration
War belong to di pastors
That lead my sheep astray
Everyone, everyone shall get his pay, yeah
All the gates of Hell
Just could never prevail
I'd like to say, Babylon fail
There is one like unto a place of fire
His name I can tell
He is conquering and to conquer
The gates of doom and hell
And life, long life, is His reward
To them that are good
As for the heathen, as for the heathen
In their hearts, His name is terrible and dreadful

In dis ya war, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in I-ration, in I-ration
War, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in a I-ration
In dis ya war, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in I-ration, in I-ration
War, di war, di war
It's the Armagideon
Taking place in a I-ration
The night is passed, the day is come
I see Jah shining in the shining sun
The night is passed, the day is come
I see Jah shining...Embed
