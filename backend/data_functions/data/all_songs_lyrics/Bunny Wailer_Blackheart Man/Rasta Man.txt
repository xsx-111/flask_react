Rasta Man Lyrics
Them kill Lumumba for his own-a-rights
But them can't kill the Rasta Man at all, 'tall, 'tall
Them can't kill the Rasta Man at all

That's the strangest man I've seen
(That's because he's a Rasta Man)
Having the mark of a Nazarene
(That's because he's a Rasta Man)
He carries a prophetical message
(That's because he's a Rasta Man)
Borning out of time and out of age
(That's because he's a Rasta Man)

The Rasta come from Zion
Rasta Man a Lion
(Oh what a Rasta Man)
The Rasta come from Zion
Rasta Man a Lion
(I-rie what a Rasta Man)

Remember Jeremiah children
(He was a Rasta Man)
Or even Isiah
(He was a Rasta Man)
Moses in the pit of mud
(He was a Rasta Man)
Trodding from Buzrak with his garments dipped in blood
(He was a Rasta Man)
Oh what a dread, dread whola one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a strange, what a dread, but a righteous man
The Rasta Man, him come from Zion
What a dread, dread up-full one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a dread-black, dread-lock one
The Rasta Man come from Zion

Lightening!
Seven years years of famine for seven years of plenty
Is like two grains of wheat for one bale of barley
A hand-full of corn shall be on the hillside
And with that you've got to be satisfied

It was Elijah who prayed that it did not rain
(He was a Rasta Man)
He prayed and the rains came again
(He was a Rasta Man)
It was Joshua who commanded the sun stand still
(He was a Rasta Man)
He did that according to his Master's will
(Who was a Rasta Man)
What a dread, dread whola one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a strange, what a dread, but a up-full one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a black, dread up-full one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a strange, dread-lock one
The Rasta Man come from Zion

What a dread, what a dread, what a whola one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a dread, dread lightening one
The Rasta Man come from Zion
What a strange dread, dread earthquake one
The Rasta Man come from ZionEmbed
