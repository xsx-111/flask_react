This Train Lyrics
When I was just a kid, little children
My old man used to sing a litle song
But now I've grown to be a man
But it still lingers deep within my soul
Oh yes it lingers deep within my soul

He say now this train it is bound to glory, this train
This train it is bound to glory this train, this train
This train it is bound to glory
This train it don't carry no unholy
This train is bound to glory, this train

Now this train it don't carry no backsliders, this train
This train don't carry no backsliders, this train
This train it don't carry no backsliders this train only carry Jah Jah children
This train it is bound to glory, this train
Play a little song for me


This train don't carry no unholy this train
This train don't carry no unholy this train
This train it don't carry no unholy
This train only carry the children of Jah
This train it is bound to glory, this train
There's so many things to remember
So many things to forget
But these word they do linger deep within my soul
Lingers deep within my soul

He say now this train it is bound to glory, this train
This train it is bound to glory this train, this train
This train it is bound to glory, This train it don't carry no unholy
This train is bound to glory, this train
(This train)
Let me hear the choir sing
(This train)
I don't wanna be late
(This train)
I don't wanna be left behind
I wanna be there
Be there and arrive on time, yes

This train is bound to glory
This train is bound to glory, y'all
This train is bound to glory
This train is bound to glory, y'all
This train is bound to glory
This train is bound to glory, y'all
This train is bound to glory
This train is bound to glory, y'all
This train is bound to glory
This train is bound to glory, y'all
This train is bound to glory
This train is bound to glory, y'all
This train is bound to glory
This train is bound to glory, y'all
This train is bound to glory
This train is bound to glory, y'all
I'll be turning back for no brother no sister
No friend no nothing at all
I'll be crabbing the morning train
The evening train will be too late (repeat)
Grab on brothers
Grab on sisters
Grab on mother
Grab on father
Grab on friend
