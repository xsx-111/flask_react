Bide Up LyricsNo more worrying, worrying and pains
No more crying, shedding tears like rain
For the master has come back
Gathering all his flock
Mother nature feeds the stock
Never wanting or ever lack
So bide up, with reasoning
Humble thyself and I'll be near thee
Bide up, with reasoning
Humble thyself and I'll protect thee
Frustrated children, humiliation was not in vain
Through effort, time and history
Have now found eternal gain for the dark clouds do bring rain
Then comes the sun to shine again
So we shall walk and not look back as living examples
Cause we're black
So bide up with reasoning
Humble thyself and I'll be near thee
Bide up with reasoning
Humble thyself and I'll protect thee
No more worrying, worrying and pains
No more crying, shedding tears like rainEmbed
