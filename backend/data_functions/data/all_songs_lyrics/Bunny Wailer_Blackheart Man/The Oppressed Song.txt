The Oppressed Song Lyrics
The man oppressed will seem to do the worst
But with all he possesses self preservation comes first
His damnation comes from not burning free
As destruction of the poor is their poverty
Is their poverty
Oh, it's just horrible for me, Lord
'Cause I've been living in misery

Oppression is the poor man's choice
Ah, but in this he does rejoice
His burdens though heavy, he somehow bears
As for his seed, there's only one who cares
There's only one who cares
Only one who cares for his children
Only one who cares for his woman
And, that's only him alone, Lord

Though his pilgrimage extends, his progresses ascend
But as the proud man exalts, he's gonna find his faults
But as the wise man sees, he knows, he knows
That there's no rest in the west
So to the east he goes
To the east he goes
Where he can find some peace of mind
Where he can be happy all the time
Where love is, where happiness is
That's where I wanna be, nowEmbed
