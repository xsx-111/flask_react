Fighting Against Conviction Lyrics
Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction

I find myself growing in an environment
Where finding food is just as hard as paying the rent
In trodding these roads of trial and tribulations
I've seen where some have died in desperation
To keep

Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction

In a family of ten and raised in the ghetto (In the ghetto, in the ghetto)
Hustling is the only education I know
Can't grow no crops in this concrete jungle
A situation like this is getting too hard to handle
To keep
Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, all day long
Fighting against conviction

With a pregnant woman, yes
And five kids to care for
Can't cool my heels, I've got to do the town
As skillful as I am, the jailer-man is bound to find me
I pray the day will come when I shall be free from

Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, oh, live long day
Fighting against conviction

To be trapped and caught and taken before judge and angry jury
Pleading before men, who seem to have no mercy
Can't afford to find myself down in the dungeon
I've got to stay free so that my kids won't be

Battering down sentence
Fighting against conviction
Battering down sentence, oh live long day, now
Fighting against conviction
Now a fugitive at large
Could this be my destiny?
With no one to care for the wellfare of my family
In solitude I've found new faith and hope in this I'll be secure
For mind and soul would soon be weary
Just couldn't take no more

Battering down sentence, oh live long day
Fighting against conviction, children, hear me when I say
Battering down sentence, all day long
Fighting against conviction, hear me when I sing my songEmbed
