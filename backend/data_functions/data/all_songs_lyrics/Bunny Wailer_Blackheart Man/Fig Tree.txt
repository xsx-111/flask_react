Fig Tree Lyrics
Never never knew that the time would come
When every man's got to find where he does come from
Never never knew that the day would come
When every fig must find its fig tree

Jump little figs into your tree
And say you are free. say you are free
I've been rebuked and I've been scorned
Rejected of men, now i'm born
To start a new, so won't you too
My loved ones come drink new wine with me
Lets live and love in peace and harmony
And say we are free, say we are free

In my fig tree, where i wanna be
So safe and free in my fig tree
Where i long to be from all misery
Now ever man is a man and every mickle mak a mottle
Don't free some and put some in a shackle
For now is the time and the time is now
When we should live like in the days of old
When every sheep had their fold
To say they were free, say they were free
In my fig tree, where i wanna be
So safe and free in my fig tree
Where i long to be from all misery
In my my my my fig tree where i long to be......Embed
