Intimate Slavery LyricsHappy birthday you broken child
Of the barbed ribs and the poison heart
I would show you the view of life from the floor
But the knees are as far as you go
I give you exhibit A
A country girl bludgeoned with an elephant tusk
I give you everything I have wrapped in a shy kiss for you to use once and then destroyEmbed
