Starbelly LyricsDear everything
Today I witnessed a crucifixion in pink and lavender and gold
I've heard people say that beauty is in details
But I don't think they have ever seen you
There were mortal wounds inflicted on the sky
And incriminating blue stains on my shirt
The shirt you bought for me
Christ it hurts
Like stars in my belly going supernova
I feel like a zombie that refuses to live
Haunting the junkyards and cutting myself on scraps of you
The other day I masturbated to pictures of you at your birthday party
They were the only ones I still had
It felt so wrong, just like my life
I hope I'm dead by the time you read this. I love you1Embed
