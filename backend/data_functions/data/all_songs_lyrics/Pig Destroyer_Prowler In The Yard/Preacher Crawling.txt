Preacher Crawling LyricsI dream sometimes of a brother in red
The first unborn
Perhaps the son of god aborted
And tossed in a garbage bag
Life is black comedy
Slapstick and vulgarity
Unworthy of the name
I still remember where mine went so wrong
My last night in Sodom and my first morning in hellEmbed
