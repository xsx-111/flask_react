Naked Trees LyricsOnce colorful dreams now swing like dead paratroops from the naked trees
Your sky lips and snow skin are sugar for the carrion perched high atop the naked trees
A flower on the bed of brittle leaves
A mass grave of tiny angels fallen from the heavens from the naked trees
Rot beautiful creature all lifeless and serene
A patch of scorched earth
Naked beneath the naked treesEmbed
