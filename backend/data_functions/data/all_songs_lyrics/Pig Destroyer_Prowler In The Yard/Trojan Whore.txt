Trojan Whore LyricsHalf in darkness she stands
In a dress of shrapnel
Smoke and torn flags
Dragging off cigarettes of human skin
Eyes like cracked eggshells empty as life
Her index fingers drip mothers milk
Like hypodermic needles
She stumbles through my veins high on ash
And dry semen
Fiending for loveEmbed
