Weighed Down Lyrics
A siren's melody, how could I know?
A silent lullaby, to your soul
Caught in a slow decline
And you're gonna fall
When you don't know the way at all
And now they see into your head
And they see into your mind in here

And no, that isn't all how it ends
We will you ever be the same
Before you needed every touch
Before you needed everyone to say
You're living through a lover's eyes
And she's paying all the time
Living in another lifeless place

And now you're way down
Weighed down
Weighed down
Weighed down
Weighed down
Didn't need another life to lead
When you're weighed down
Way, way down
Siren on a winter's day
Driven mad, you played your part
Now here goes the melody
How bare it is

'Cause they see into your mind in here
But say that isn't all how it ends
Did it really have to be this way?
Did you need another touch?
In the shadow of a slow decay
Living through a lover's eyes
Is there any higher price?
Living in another lifeless place

And now you're way down
Weighed down
Weighed down
Weighed down
Weighed down
Didn't need another life to lead
When you're weighed down
Way, way down
The weight, the weight
The darkness on your shoulders
The weight, the weight
The darkness in your soul but
The weight, the weight
The darkness on your shoulders
The weight, the weight
The darkness in your soul but
Don't let love bring you down
Don't let love bring you down with me
Don't let love bring you down
Don't let love bring you down, you downEmbed
