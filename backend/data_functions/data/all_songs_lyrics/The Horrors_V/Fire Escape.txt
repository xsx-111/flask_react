Fire Escape Lyrics

The people that you see
Are drifting by without a word
Face alone
All life escapes
To our own devices
Left uneven while you sleep to waste

You're scared to even try
Get up and start again
And following the sky
You'll watch the season end
Still you let the fire escape

And life's a blade
A whipping line
The people that you see
Are drifting out through tired eyes
All dreams 
All dreams replaced
Every fantasy is peaceful
Even sleeping in the wild
You're scared to even try
Get up and start again
And when you look within
You'll watch the season end
Still you let the fire escape

Still you let the fire escape
Still you let the fire escape
Still you let the fire escape
Still you let the fire escape
Still you let the fire escapeEmbed
