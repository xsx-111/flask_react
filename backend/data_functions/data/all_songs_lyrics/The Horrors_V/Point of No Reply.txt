Point of No Reply Lyrics
You know you take such pride in making people feel sick
Blood and lipstick, hiding yourself in a myth
Now your landscape's taking a shape
Naming names and twisting the picture
Throwing knives with an eye for revenge
You tell your friends I hate you
There's nothing I can do
Inside I'm already played
And there's nowhere left to go
You can bury me there where I lay

It's the right place, wrong time
Through this two-way mirror
No sign of life
The point of no reply
It's the right place, wrong time
Through this two-way mirror
No sign of life
The point of no reply

Wouldn't be the first to find delight in pain
I'm fighting the fire and you're fanning the flames
And there's nothing I can say
In silence you already know
And it's only in the dark
Your anger slips out of control
It's the right place, wrong time
Through this two-way mirror
No sign of life
The point of no reply
It's the right place, wrong time
Through this two-way mirror
No sign of life
The point of no reply3Embed
