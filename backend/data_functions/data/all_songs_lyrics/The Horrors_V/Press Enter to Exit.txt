Press Enter to Exit Lyrics
What does it tell you when you change into a stranger?
What words can never be denied?
When does it start to turn the shade into a shadow?
How does your life become a lie?
Questions unanswered
You walk into the storm
Because there's no point in waiting now
For the promise of a cure

Stuck in an echo, an echo of life
Stuck in an echo of life

There's only so far that the eye can see
And if you think twice would you still believe
This moment in time that will soon repeat
Until you get beyond

Quiet we try, we cross so many lifetimes
Where is the message that you sent?
And you don't need to leave, you only need a lifeline
It's the beginning of the end
Promises broken, and words make their return
So what are you waiting for when the cure is now a curse?
Stuck in an echo, an echo of life
Stuck in an echo of life

There's only so far that the eye can see
And if you think twice would you still believe
This moment in time that will soon repeat
Until you get beyond

Na-nana-na, we'll get so far
Na-nana-na, give back to the stars
Na-nana-na, we'll get so far
Na-nana-na

Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Give up, give up, give up, give up, give up
Get up, get up
Get up and you'll see
Get up, get up
Get up
Get up, get up
Get up and you'll see
Get up, get up
Get up
Get up, get up
Get up and you'll see
Get up, get up
Get up
Get up, get up
Get up and you'll see
Get up, get up
Get upEmbed
