Machine Lyrics
Your smile is nothing to live for
But read out your lines
And bring the fantasy to life
You taste like a ghost
A cold simulation
So close to the truth
A costume jewel, an off-white lie

Insect in amber, is that what you are?
Keep that in mind now
Insect in amber, the death of a star
Now and forever

Because you will never, never, never, be
Yeah you will never, never, never, be
More than a machine

A trace of a smile
A sly imitation
Light with no heat
An empty cry in silent streets
Your mannequin moves
You ghost through the motions
Who do you think it is
That keeps this scene alive?
Insect in amber, is that what you are?
Keep it in mind now
Insect in amber, the death of a star
Now and forever

Because you will never, never, never, be
Yeah you will never, never, never, be
More than a machine

Insect in amber forever you are
Keep that in mind now
Insect in amber the death of a star
Keep that in mind now
No going back and thereâ€™s no one to tell
Nowhere to turn, better turn on yourself
No more disguises to find a way out
And you will never never be
Because you will never never never be
Yeah you will never never never be2Embed
