World Below Lyrics
My dreams are all I can give you
No second chances now
There's only one way of knowing
It's just a moment
Hold on, one day old
Twisting your way through the clouds
Hold on, morning comes
Braiding these flames on the earth

Looking down at the world below
Looking out of your cold window
Twisting over, restless in your bed
Looking down at the world below
The life beyond the open window, twisting over

Bright lights overhead
Always all times
The white noise never ends
Oh now, all times
Bright lights overhead

I, I've got no way of knowing how these days will run
I've got no way of trusting these dreams that grow out of my reach
Looking down at the ghosts below
Looking down through the closed window
Rolling oceans over in your bed
Looking down on the world below
Your life delayed, your days are slow
Twisting over, bright lights overhead

Bright lights overhead
Always all times
The white noise never ends
Oh now, all times
Bright lights overhead

Bright lights overhead
Bright lights overhead
Bright lights overhead1Embed
