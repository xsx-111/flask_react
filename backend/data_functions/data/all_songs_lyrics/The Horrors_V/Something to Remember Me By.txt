Something to Remember Me By Lyrics
Memory revolving
The fear of letting go
The arrow of acceptance
The moment when you know, you know, you know
And when the answers only divide
When you never question the doubts in your mind
When the distance grows but the end is in sight
Nothing left to lose when there's nothing left to find

Now, all that's left behind
Something to remember me by
Oh, the fear, the slow divide
Something to remember me by, by
All the silent signs
Something to remember me by
Two sides, a double life
Something to remember me by, by

I've gone too far this time
But chances come and go
You say that I believe my lies
But now you'll never know, you know you won't
And when the answers only divide
Walking in a crowd and I leave you behind
Back into the dark with the lions of night
Nothing left to lose when there's nothing left to find
Now, all that's left behind
Something to remember me by
Oh, the fear, the slow divide
Something to remember me by, by
All the silent signs
Something to remember me by
Two sides, a double life
Something to remember me by, by


Now, all that's left behind
Now, the fear, the slow divide
Seeing all the silent signs
Something to remember me by
Now, all that's left behind
Now, the fear, the slow divide
Seeing all the silent signs
Something to remember me by, by
Something to remember me by, by
Something to remember me by, by2Embed
