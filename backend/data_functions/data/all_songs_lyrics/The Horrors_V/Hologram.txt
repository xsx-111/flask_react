Hologram Lyrics
Raise your head up high, let's leave this ordinary world
Raise your voice up loud, it's time to go
And we'll ride this wave as far as we can
All our future days in this hologram

Are we hologram?
Are we vision?
Are we hologram?
Are we vision?
Hologram
Hologram
Hologram

Raise your head up high, let's leave this ordinary world now
There will be no end to where we go
Through every unnumbered day, we'll journey forever
Riding on these writhing waves, we travel the light

Are we hologram?
Are we vision?
Are we hologram?
Are we vision?
