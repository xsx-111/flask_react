Ghost Lyrics
People falling around
Down, down
You feel the jewel in the crown slipping out
Gotta keep your eyes on the road
Don't let them close
It's all an act, part of my love
I won't let you go

Feels like I'm tied to these tracks, no way out
Ship full of hypnotists
I slip, I won't let you go

Come feel her, come feel her
Come feel her, come feel her
Come feel her, come feel her
Come feel her

They’re just believers
Violent dreamers
Rolling over, endlessly
They’re just believers
Lifetime stealers
Rolling over, endlessly
Come feel her, come feel her
Come feel her, come feel her
Come feel her, come feel her
Come feel herEmbed
