Gathering Lyrics
You ready?

Are you listening?
Someone is whispering, drawing you inside
Dark winter weather, hunters are gathering
Each to his own side
Too many liars, spies and jealous types
Away from the lamplight
But these are the people
Who know what they're looking for
Who know what they want

And there's someone out there seeing everything and who knows what you know
And there's someone out there seeing everything and who knows what you know, and what you don't

So write me a letter if you think you know the truth
Stay underground
Leave your blood diamonds
Lifetime is drawing in
Leading the light away
And there's someone out there seeing everything and who knows what you know
And there's someone out there seeing everything and who knows what you know, and what you don't

There's someone out there seeing everything and who knows what you know
And there's someone out there seeing everything and who knows what you know, what you know2Embed
