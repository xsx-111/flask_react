Ultimate LyricsIf we are here not to do
What you and I wanna do
And go forever crazy with it
Why the hell are we even here?

There was never any good old days
They are today, they are tomorrow
It's a stupid thing we say
Cursing tomorrow with sorrow
When we stand here in a row
Looking like a bunch of heroes
I know that-a deep inside
Nothing more but bunch of zeros
Skolko utetchki tepla
Vot takaja vot subda
Nam segodnja suzdena
A bti mezget chto kogda da-j povezet!

Steppin' on the trail of Ultimate
I would never choose to die
So give me the rest of all the secrets
Give me new culture of life
Ultimate!
Ultimate!
Ultimate!
