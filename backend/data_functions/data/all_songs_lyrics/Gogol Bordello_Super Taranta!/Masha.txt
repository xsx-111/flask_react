Masha LyricsMasha Chichkadrichkina been in America
Already for six years
She successfully lost all her Russian friends
When she drinks she says, "Cheers!"
Late at night she makes decisions
Based upon new superstitions
With a very focused stare
Into the muted television
(I kill you)
Mama Diaspora has been good to her
She’s got stenka husband and hrustal', farfor
Suddenly in midst of all this precision
She receives following vision:
To the tune of Woolly Boolly
Appears ghost of Yuriy Nikulin
In the hand he’s got a letter
Masha, Masha what is the matter?
Masha, Masha what is the matter?
And the letter of course says
And the letter of course says
Masha, Masha your life is good
But the good life is even better
(I kill you)Embed
