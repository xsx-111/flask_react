Tribal Connection LyricsWhere there's a music shall be comin' out of every car
There is a silence all over downtown
Where community celebrations shall be aroused
I walk the sterile gardens where life is on pause
No can do this!
No can do that!
What the hell can you do, my friend?
In this place that you call your town
I guess you can't expect much from the hometown
Well I don't know if you can even call it your own
When they don't want you to get near excitement
And in protest to that you just stay home
No can do this!
No can do that!
What the hell can you do, my friend?
In this place that you call your town
On intersection of all dimensions
Where I was stoppin' by just for a drink
I meet a brother from tribal connection
Of our fun loving restless breed
I wanna walk this Earth like it is mine
And so is everyone in our funlovin' tribe
C'mon, is that real so much to ask
From all these goddamn nazi-fuedals
I'm gonna take it to community
Cause I want everyone to see
There never was any conspiracy
And we are all here simple to sing:
No can do this! No can do that!
Where the's music should be comin' out of every car
There is a silence all over downtown
Only intersection semi-alive
Outskirts are sedated, me gone...Embed
