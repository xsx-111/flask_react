Suddenly... (I Miss Carpaty) LyricsSuddenly door opened just a crack
A hand reached out and ordered me to duck
Took me to a Sturm and Drang banquet
Where Rismsky and Korsakov they met
On the Sturm and Drang banquet
Where Kunitzky popal pod zapret
A stambuljanskij k Rudiku v Kismet
Still i miss Carpaty!
Miss Carpaty, miss Carpaty
Samopomitch proshu next
Miss Carpaty, miss Carpaty
Sojuzivka is the best
But I still miss Carpaty!Embed
