American Wedding Lyrics
Have you ever been to American wedding?
Where is the vodka?
Where is marinated herring?
Where is the musicians that got the taste?
Where is the supply that's gonna last three days?
Where is the band that like fanfare
Gonna keep it going 24 hours

Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-didi-didi-da-dow
Daaaaaaaa
Dada-dada-dada-da
Daaaa
Dada-dada-dada-da

Instead it's one in the morning
And DJ is patching up the cords
Everybody's full of cake
Staring at the floor
Proper couples start to mumble
That it's time to go
People gotta get up early
Yep, they gotta go

People gotta get up early
And she's gotta boyfriend
And this whole fucking thing
Is one huge disappointment
And nothing gets these bitches going
Not even Gipsy Kings
Nobody talks about my supertheory
Of supereverything!
So be Donald Trump
Or be an anarchist
Make sure that your wedding
Doesn't end up like this

I understand the cultures
Of a different kind
But here word celebration
Just doesn't come to mind!

Have you ever been to American wedding?
Where is the vodka?
Where is marinated herring?
Where is the musicians that got the taste?
Where is the supply that's gonna last three days?
Where is the band that like fanfare
Gonna keep it going 24 hours
