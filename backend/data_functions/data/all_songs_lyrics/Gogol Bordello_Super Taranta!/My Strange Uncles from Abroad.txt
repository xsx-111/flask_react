My Strange Uncles from Abroad LyricsMy strange uncles from abroad
Yes I never met them
But I took everything they wrote
And I'll never forget them
Through the mystical communication
Deep within it all comes true
Forming underground railroad
For our ultimate break through!
My strange nephews from abroad
I'll meet them on the cosmos streets
And we will drink to how we never told you
To trust a plastic beat
Bright open eyes. they are still looking
They are still finding
A few unpoisoned hearts
No matter where you are exiled
No matter where you are exiled!Embed
