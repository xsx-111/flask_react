Supertheory of Supereverything Lyrics
First time I had read the Bible
It had stroke me as unwitty
I think it may started rumor
That the Lord ain't got no humor

Put me inside SSC
Let's test superstring theory
Oh yoi yoi accelerate the protons
I stir it twice and then just add me, cause

I don't read the Bible
I don't trust disciple
Even if they're made of marble
Or Canal Street bling

From the maelstrom of the knowledge
Into the labyrinth of doubt
Frozed underground ocean
Melting, nuking on my mind

Give me Everything Theory
Without Nazi uniformity
My brothers are protons
My sisters are neurons
I stir it twice, it's instant family

My brothers are protons
My sisters are neurons
I stir it twice dlja prekrastnih dam

Do you have sex maniacs
Or schizophrenics
Or astrophysicists in your family
Was my grandma anti, anti
Was my grandpa bounty, bounty
Hek-o-hek-o-hej-o
They ask me in embassy


And my grandma she was anti
And my grandpa he was bounty
I stir it twice
Add Canal Street Bling
Party, party, party, party, party, party, afterparty
Oy yoy yoy, accelerate the protons
And then just add meEmbed
