Zina-Marina LyricsZina, Marina, Tascha, Valentina, Sascha, Anastazija, Anna, Sophija
It is easier to see
Evil as entity
Not as condition inside you and me
I did not invent it, I'm just in charge of it
Simple businessman with simple practical plan
So do you wanna be a model, yeah?
All you got to do is show up, wow!
We'll be leaving soon for the breaking ground
For there will forever be poverty
There forever be cruelty
Zina, Marina, Zenia, Palina, Katia, Maria, eksrtakto wsju Rossiju
There forever be wretched of Earth
Crawlin' up round driven by last semen drop
Factory that makes you, they say, it never stops
Factory that makes them, I know, it never stops...
So do you wanna be a model, yeah?
All you got to do is show up, wow!
We'll be leaving soon for the breaking ground
For there will forever be slavery
There forever be cruelty
In this game they'll always be on the top
And it's up for you to learn or not!
Eh! padavai-ka djadka lodku, babenok zagruzgai-ka
Oi, davai davai!... trimai denga denga
Oh da kino-cameru da zhurnalistik nu ka dai-ka
Eh! po chernu morju... da na Dubai DubaiEmbed
