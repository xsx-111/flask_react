Harem in Tuscany (Taranta) LyricsAfter getting his political message I come across
Uncle Sandro experienced absolutely devastating
Absolutely excruciating, a sense of loss
Yo Uncle Sandro, how we don't really know
But seems like politicians can be only wrong
And so to feel divine again and innocent and free
Sandro headed straight to the harem in Tuscany
Ran Taranta, ran Taranta, ran Taranta, harem in Tuscany
Ran Taranta, Super Taranta, harem in Tuscany
Rock and rock and rock and rock
And rock and rock and rock and roll
Sandro came back from world travel stupider than left
Even good guys fight each other, even bad songs being theft
He walked stupid and talked stupid he could not comprehend
And therefore everyone called him a stupid man
Everybody wonders about meaning of the life
I set out to conquer fucker Polutchilsja Kalf
And so to feel divine again and innocent and free
Sandro headed straight to harem in Tuscany
Ran Taranta, ran Taranta, ran Taranta, harem in Tuscany
Ran Taranta, Super Taranta, harem in Tuscany
Rock and rock and rock and rock
And rock and rock and rock and roll
Only ones in the good spirit full of life and good advice
Who's not jealous and not bitter come to me let's talk about
How to live a decent life when you are bigger than life
Where the hell the top or bottom in this good goddamn ying yang?
Everybody wonders nu-li about meaning of the life
I set out to conquer fucker and a Polutchilsja Kalf
To harem of innocence Devla le-la let me in
'Cause the boots of decent life they are just too small for me
Ah ti tjotenka patchkunja ai ti djadka moidodir
Zgeka, kak tam progibalovo ili normaldy?
Sandro came out of the harem stupider than left
Even good girls fight each other, knickers being theft
He walked stupid and talked stupid he could not comprehend
And so to feel divine again and innocent and free
Get ready for punk rock siesta in harem in Carpaty
Ran Taranta, ran Taranta, ran Taranta, harem in Carpaty
Ran Taranta, Super Taranta, harem in Carpaty
Rock and rock and rock and rock
And rock and rock and rock and rollEmbed
