June Lyrics
The show was ending and I had started to crack
Woke up in Chicago when the sky turned black
And you're so high, you're so high, you have to be an angel
And I'm so high, I'm so high, I can see an angel

I hear your heart beating in your chest
The world slows till there's nothing left
Skyscrapers look on like great, unblinking giants
In those heavy days in June
When love became an act of defiance

Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other

And you were broken-hearted
And the world was too
And I was beginning to lose my grip
And I have always held it loosely
But this time I admit
I felt it really start to slip
And choirs sing in the street
And I would come to you
To watch the television screen
In your hotel room
I'm always down to hide with you
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other
Hold on to each other

You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You're so high, you're so high
You have to be an angel
And I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I'm so high, I'm so high
I can see an angel12Embed
