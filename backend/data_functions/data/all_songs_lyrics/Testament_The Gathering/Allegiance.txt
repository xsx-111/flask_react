Allegiance LyricsHey everybody
Join together unified
Hey are you ready
For us all to fight for pride
It's our last chance to defend
Our war cries to the bitter end
Pray up to the heavens
Our creator justifies...
A war dance of indians
It's my own allegiance to the fight
Me... white... breed...
Everybody simbolize
Join together unified
Hey everybody
Come together, raise the knife
Same old promise
That we've heard a thousand times
It's our last chance to defend
War cries to the bitter end
As man shows his ignorance
It's my own allegiance to the fight
Fight... me... white... breed...
Everybody simbolize
Join together unified
Fight... me... white... breed...
Everybody stand and rise
And join together unifiedEmbed
