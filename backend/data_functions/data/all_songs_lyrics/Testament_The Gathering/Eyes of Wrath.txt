Eyes of Wrath LyricsEyes of wrath
The beast is on your back
Razorblade slice your neck
Slowly tear you down
You take another life
To feed his bloody lust
Random crime spree attack
There's nothing random at all
Dead city nights
Another daughter's done
Can you hear the screams
Dead city nights
Another daughter's done
Another victim of circumstance
Took the wrong way home
Can you hear the screams
The music of the dead
A ritual of broken flesh
Anoints the silver blade
No one lives forever
There is no forever
And I'll tell you why
Rage
Rage soothes the pain
Pain
Pain soothes the rage
Lash out in anger
That never will chance
I can never escape
Rage
Rage soothes the pain
Pain
Pain soothes the rage
Rage
PainEmbed
