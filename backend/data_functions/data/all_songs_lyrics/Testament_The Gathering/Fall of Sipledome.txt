Fall of Sipledome LyricsMelting Ice Beneath the wave
Frozen ice sheets
Slowly start to break away
Another cycle has begun
The ice is flowing
The melt down has begun
Fall of siple dome...
The core reveals the past
Of a world once lost...
Shifting ice plates below
Without warning
Inter glacial sudden death
Land of ice, free to roam
Global warming
The sea will overflow
Sheets below, float in time
Arctic death millenium
Melted ice floods the earth
In twenty thousand years
The process repeats
Under ice the river flows
Swiftly moving
Falling earth into the sea
Death is slowly on the move
The level's rising
And there's nothing we can do
Fall of siple dome...
The core revealed the past
Of a world once lost...
Man will find the climate change
Mandatory
Extinction of the human race
Apocalypse millenium
Our world gets colder
To meltdown by the sun
Sheets below, float in time
Arctic death millenium
Melted ice floods the earth
In twenty thousand years
The process repeats
And in the end yu will find
Under the sea earth will rise
Freezing, melting, oceans, rise...
Tidal waves found the shore
Destroying cities
No longer can be recognised
Devastation to us all
The sea will rise
And a world soon to fall
Fall of siple doom...
The core revealed the past...
Of a world once lost...
Fall of siple dome!!!Embed
