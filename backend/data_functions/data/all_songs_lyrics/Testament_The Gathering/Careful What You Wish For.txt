Careful What You Wish For Lyrics
Grace, in a perfect world
On shines the light
Praise, an angelic song
But there's another side you'll see
Now hide
Salvation easily denied
Reigns, down with misery
Life's not always what it seems
False hope
Written in the testament of old
Take heed
Stop believing every word you read
Truth, inconsistencies
Distorts the lie
False imprisonment
Forever lost inside your mind
Fate's door
Just be careful what you wish for
Death's door
Just be careful what you wish for
Peace of mind
I can't find
Don't be blind
Take the ride
Hey! We live in a fucked up world
Walking on through the demise
We step into the unknown
You better save yourself

Hey! We live in a fucked up world
Hiding behind the disguise
Never let your feelings show
Why can't you be yourself?
We live in a fucked up world
Walking on through the demise
We step into the unknown
You better save yourself
