True Believer LyricsDo you believe in the darkness below
Well I can summon them up
If you really want to know
As I tow the line
Between bad and evil
Nothing can touch me now
True believer
Born in sin where I pledge my evil oath
Violence is golden now
Did you really want to go
As I draw the line
Between bad and evil
Nothing can touch me now
True believer
True believer...
Nothing can stop me now
And nothing can touch me now
True believer...
No use in praying forever shall I roam
Smoke dusted angels now
It's the only way I know
As I cross the line
Between bad and evil
Nothing can touch me now
True believer
Ash to ashes, Dust to dust
All I ever wanted was power of the blood
Now look what I have done
What I have become
I'm the choosen one
Never gonna take me
Never gonna change me
Never gonna escape me now...
Do you believe there is evil in my soul
One final high is the way
That I really want to go
As I cross the line
Between bad and evil
Nothing can touch me now
True believerEmbed
