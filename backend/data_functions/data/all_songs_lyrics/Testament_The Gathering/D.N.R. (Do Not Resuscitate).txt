D.N.R. (Do Not Resuscitate) Lyrics
Lies, broken dreams, dismal past
Is there more in life I should have known
Ending wars, ending pain
Ending of mankind is insane
When there's all these possibilities
Some will fail and some will achieve
Even though in my youth
I didn't know but what can I do

And I may not ever see
In my pain, my suffering
Cannot live for the rest of my life
D.N.R. do not resuscitate me

Life, lost unseen behind the mask
And with the open arms will I grasp
Open doors, open minds
Ending all the madness I hate

And I may not ever see
In my pain, my misery
Can not live for the rest of my life
D.N.R. do not resuscitate me, D.N.R
Wing of sadness will hold my prayers
All this madness will end my fears
Contempt in life, conceptualize
Wrong or right, the ending of life
God, save me now

Time, end it now, no going back
Can you see the light as you pass
Ending wars, ending pain
Waited all my life to be saves

And I will not ever see
All the hate and suffering
Can not live for the rest of my life
D.N.R. do not resuscitate me, D.N.REmbed
