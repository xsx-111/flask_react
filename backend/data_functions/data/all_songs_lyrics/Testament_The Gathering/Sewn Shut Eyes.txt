Sewn Shut Eyes LyricsHate...
Hate is a lesson we know
Alone on its own it will die
It eats what it needs to survive...
It wants to survive
Every night you look deep in your soul
Burn the fields
Where the the hatred is grown...
Hate...
Hate always seething to find
Some way to get to your brain
Infesting what's pure in the mind
Hatred divine...
Look around you is anyone pure
Free of hatred
Inside this cold world
Pre-conceived
Truth from lies
Blind to see
Thru sewn shut eyes
Hate breeds hate
Hate...
Always eager to rise
Above all to gain full control
Infesting what's pure in the mind
Evil entwined...
Even now that the seeds have been sewn
Burn the fields
Where the hatred still grows...
Hate breeds hate
How many have die
Before we realize hate undermines
Hate...
Hate always eager to find
Some way to tear out your soul
Surviving the passage of time
Dirty white lies...
Back in time as our history shows
Endless cycless
Of hatred still flow
Pre-conceived heartless lies
Blind to see - thru sewn shut eyes
Is there still hope for us now?
I said - is there still hope for us now?
NO!!!Embed
