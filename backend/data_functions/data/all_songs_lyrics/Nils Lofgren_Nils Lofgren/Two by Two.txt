Two by Two LyricsThey been walking out two by two
Heart with heart and hand in hand
I was searching for that loving girl
Who was out to save this lonely man
What I didn't understand was that the girl
I loved felt that we were through
They been walking out heart with heart
Hand in hand, two by two
Oh you night, you're such a long boring night, if you're part me
Come one now bring my friend's
That are part of what this poor boy need
Alright now all right the night feel big and tall
No you dark nights, you lit that fire then you blew it all out now
They been walking out two by two
Heart with heart and hand in hand
I was searching for that loving girl
Who was out to save this lonely man
What I didn't understand was that the girl
I loved felt that we were through
They been walking out heart with heart
Hand in hand, two by two
They been walking out heart with heart, hand in hand, two by twoEmbed
