One More Saturday Night LyricsLooking hard left and right
Tracking out every woman in sight
Sip sip sip my fifth whisky
Playing today I slept alone last night
I got eyes in the back of my head
Working on six, trying to get a woman in my bed
Looks like another one night stand
One more Saturday night, one more don't feel right
And the week gets lonely
(How did you make out Saturday night
Did you make out Saturday night)
One more Saturday night, ain't no love in sight
And the week gets lonely
(How did you make out Saturday night
Did you make out Saturday night)
I get so weary and tired too, OK
Mean fate, hard to shake
Shimmy-jimmy with a girl named Kate
To best describe we call it lady luck
I felt the feeling she choke me up
That pretty woman made a good time fun
My wet cheeks watch her hit the sun with a bye bye bye
Just a little too long
One more Saturday night, one more don't feel right
And the week gets lonely
(How did you make out Saturday night
Did you make out Saturday night)
One more Saturday night, ain't no love in sight
And the week gets lonely
(How did you make out Saturday night
Did you make out Saturday night)
I get so weary and tired too, OK
(How did you make out Saturday night
Did you make out Saturday night)
One more Saturday night it don't feel right
(How did you make out Saturday night
Did you make out Saturday night)
Turning out every woman on Saturday night
(How did you make out Saturday night
Did you make out Saturday night)
There's a lot of girls around, there ain't no love in sightEmbed
