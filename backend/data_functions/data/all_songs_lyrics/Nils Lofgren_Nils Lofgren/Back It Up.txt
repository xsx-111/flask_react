Back It Up LyricsEveryday I get complaints from you
Starts me thinking baby I'm your fool
Broken dreams all on the floor
You can't back it up anymore
'Cause I found out love just ain't enough
I need devotion to back it up (Back it up baby)
I found out, love just ain't enough (Back it up now)
I need devotion to back it up (Back it up baby)
Right back to the top (Back it up now)
You made the moment till the pain has stopped
(Back it up baby) Roll it over twice
Don't give up there might be something nice
I said don't give up
Hold on now, it's a shame I say
You've been cheating on me, friends say
Let them all look and laugh at me
'Cause I'm so far even you can't see
(Back it up baby) I found out love just ain't enough
I need devotion to back it up (Back it up now)
I found out love just ain't enough (Back it up baby)
I need devotion to back it up (Back it up now)
(Back it up baby) I need devotion, you do too
(Back it up now) Come on give it like I give it to you
(Back it up, baby) I know I know you been cheating on me
(Back it up now) You gonna pay for it , wait and see
(Back it up baby) Before I turn you loose
(Back it up now) You feel good but it ain't no excuse
(Back it up baby) I believe it sure enough
(Back it up now) We all need devotions to back it upEmbed
