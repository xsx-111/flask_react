Duty LyricsI seem to turn
My world all around you
I keep regretting I found you
And it brings power to think you feel the same way too
But it’s my duty, it’s my charm
It’s my sense of knowing right from wrong
If you’re black and white
I brought your colors back to life
It’s my duty to remain in charge baby
I see you around
Keep you out of the blue
I don’t do all I please
Right now I am on my knees
Just to keep you in a good place
But it’s my duty, it’s my charm
It’s my sense of knowing right from wrong
If you’re black and white
I brought your colors back to life
It’s my duty to remain in charge baby
Well, it’s my duty, it’s my charm
It’s my sense of knowing right from wrong
If you’re black and white
I brought your colors back to life
It’s my duty to remain in charge baby
And it's keeping you where you belong baby
Yes, it’s keeping you where you belong
It’s my duty, it’s my charm
It’s my sense of knowing right from wrong
It’s my duty, it’s my charm
It’s my sense of knowing right from wrongEmbed
