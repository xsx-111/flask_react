Baby LyricsWell I can't get to sleep tonight
No matter how hard I try
'Cause it's cold and it's dark
And the wind is a-whistling
And I can't seem to put out the light
Momma's been searching for baby
But baby been tryin' to get home
'Cause it's cold and it's dark
And the moon cannot light the way
And Daddy's gone. (Bye bye.)
I'm just a baby!
