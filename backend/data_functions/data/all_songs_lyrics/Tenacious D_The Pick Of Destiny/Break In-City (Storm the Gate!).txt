Break In-City (Storm the Gate!) LyricsThe mission is clear, I'm going over there
I'm going to do the mission
I flip around the corner, flat as a pancake
And then I- aww no, a camera
Stay back here, devise a plan
Dive into the bushes
Against all odds, infiltrate
Storm the gates!
Storm the gates!
Ninja style, samurai
(Storm the gates!)
Metal pole, climb that shit
(Storm the gates)
Climb into that motherfucker
Now I'm climbin up, up on the roof
I got cat-like reflexes
Flip
Against all odds, infiltrate
Oh, storm the gates
Two air vents on the roof
That's what the guy was talkin a- Shit!
Electric eye, infiltrate
Storm the gates!
Storm the gates!
Storm the gates!
