Classico Lyrics
Can't you see he's the man
Let me hear you applaud
He is more than a man
He's a shiny golden god
If you think it's time to fucking rock
And fucking roll
Out of control
Well then you know you've got to rock the block
And fucking suck
My fucking cock

'Cause when you rule
You fucking school
All of the fools
Out of their jewels
'Cause if you think it's time to
If you think it's time to
If you think it's time to fucking rock

He is going
To kick your fucking ass
And you know
His name is Kyle Gass
Rocking
And fucking rolling
And fucking rocking
And fucking rolling
And fucking
