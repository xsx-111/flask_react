Dude (I Totally Miss You) Lyrics
Dude, I totally miss you
I really fucking miss you
I'm all alone
All the time, all the time

Dude, I totally miss you
The things we did together
Where have you gone?

Totally miss the honesty
And special times, and honestly
I totally miss the fucked up thing you do
Dude, I totally miss you
I totally miss you
Dude, I totally miss you
All the time

Ahhh, aaah
Ahhh, aaah
Aah ya-he heh heehh ohhh!

Totally miss the honesty
And special times, and honestly
I totally miss the fucked up thing you do
Dude, I totally miss you
I totally miss you
Dude, I totally miss you
All the time

Totally miss the honesty
And special times, and honestly
I totally miss the fucked up thing you do
Dude, I totally miss you
I totally miss you
Dude, I totally miss you
All the time1Embed
