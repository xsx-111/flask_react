Kong LyricsKooonnnng!
Kooonnnng!
There is nothing on Earth that is nearly as strong
As Kong!
Kooonnnng!
In the jungle he lives, that is where he belongs
King Kong!
Kooonnnng!
Beat the drum, light the flames, sacrifice, bang the gong!
King Kong!
King
Kooonnnng!
Killing all in his path, save for that which he longs
King Kooonnnng!
Kooonnnng!
There is nothing on Earth that is nearly as strong
As Kong!
Kooonnnng!
In the jungle he lives, that is where he belongs
King Kong!
Kooonnnng!
Beat the drum, light the flames, sacrifice, bang the gong!
King Kong!
Kooonnnng!
Killing all in his path, save for that which he longs
King Kong!
King
