The Government Totally Sucks Lyrics
The government totally sucks
You motherfucker
The government totally sucks

Ben Franklin was a rebel indeed
He liked to get naked while he smoked on the weed
He was a genius but if he was here today
The government would fuck him up his righteous A!

Now let me tell you something about the government (uh huh)
They're fucking up the environment (say what?)
They're taking all the fucking beautiful animals (yeah?)
And making them fucking extinct (oh no!)

The government totally sucks
You motherfucker
The government totally sucks
The government totally sucks

'Cause the land of love and freedom
Is just a baby's breath away
And if we hold hands together
We can bring back the USA
The USA ay-ay, yeah
Bring back the USA ay-yeah
The fucking USA ay-yeah
Bring back the US
Government totally sucks

(That was amazing, you changed people's lives tonight)
Yeah it was awesome, compared to bullshit!1Embed
