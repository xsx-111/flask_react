Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown) Lyrics
I am complete!
Fu-uuck
Yes, you are fucked
Shit out of luck
Now I'm complete
And my cock you will suck
This world will be mine
And you're first in line
You brought me the pick
And now you shall both die
Wait, wait
Wait you motherfucker
We challenge you to a rock-off
Give us one chance to rock your socks off
Fuck, fuck
Fuuuuuuck
The demon code prevents me
From declining a rock-off challenge
What are your terms?
What's the catch?
If we win
You must take your sorry ass back to Hell
And also, you will have to pay our rent
And what if I win?
Then you can take Kage back to Hell...
(What?)
Trust me Kage, it's the only way
(What the fuck are you talking about?)
To be your little bitch
Fine
Let the rock-off begin
Aahahahahahaaa!
I'm the Devil
I love Metal
Check this riff
It's fucking tasty
I'm the Devil, I can do what I want
Whatever I've got I'm gonna flaunt
There's never been a rock-off
That I've ever lost
I can't wait to take Kage back to Hell
I'm gonna fill him with my hot demon gel
I'll make him squeal
Like my Scarlet Pimpernel
Noooooo!
Come on Kage, bring the thunder
There's just no way that we can win
That was a masterpiece
Listen to me
He rocks too hard
Because he's not a mortal man
Goddammit, Kage!
He gonna make you his sex slave
You're gonna gargle Mayonnaise
No...
Unless we bust a massive monster mamma-jam
Dude, we've been through so much shit
Deactivated lasers with my dick
Now it's time to blow this fucker down!
Come on, Kage
Now it's time to blow doors down
I hear you Jables
Now it's time to blow doors down
Light up the stage
'Cause it's time for a showdown
We'll bend you over
Then we'll take you to brown town
Now we've got to blow this fucker down
He's gonna rape me if we do not blow doors down
Come on Kage
'Cause it's time to blow doors down
Oooh, we'll piledrive ya
It's time for the smackdown
Hey Antichrister
Beelzeboss
We know your weakness
Our Rocket Sauce
We rock the Casbah
And blow your mind
We will defeat you
For all mankind
You hold the scepter
We hold the key
You are the Devil
We are the D!
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D
We are the D

You guys are fuckin' lame
Come on Kage, you're coming with me
Taste my lightning fucker
NOOO!
Ow! Fuck
My fuckin' horn
Oh no
From whence you came
You shall remain
Until you are complete again
Nooooooo!
Fuck you, Kage
And fuck you, Jables
I'll get you Tenacious D19Embed
