Master Exploder Lyrics
This uh next band asked me not to read this
But, goddammit, I'm going to read it anyway
Because I wrote it, and it's the truth
I fucking love this band
They're the best band ever, period
Ladies and gentlemen, Tenacious D
Hey, what's up
Me and KG wrote this song 5 minutes ago
It's called "Master Exploder"

Ahh!

I do not need
He does not need
A microphone
A microphone
My voice is fucking
Fucking
Powerful!

Ahh
Ah-aaah!
Sorry
I did not mean
He did not mean
To blow your mind
To blow your mind
But that shit happens to me
All the time

Now take a look
Take a look
Tell me what do you see?
What do you see?
We've got the Pick
Of Destiny

Ahh
Ahhh-yea!2Embed
