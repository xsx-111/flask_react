History Lyrics
This is a song called
The History of Tenacious D
And it's not just a list of bullshit
That we've done in the past
It's a chronicling of our rise — To power!

We ride with kings on mighty steeds
Across the Devil's plain
We've walked with Jesus and his cross
He did not die in vain — No!

We've run with wolves, we've climbed K2
Even stopped a moving train
We've traveled through space and time, my friends
To rock this house again — Rock!

We ride and we ride, and we'll never subside
And we'll ride 'til the planets collide
And if you say that we do not ride
I'll tan your fuckin' hide — Ride!

Kyle's fingers be silver — Jack's voice then be gold
But lest you think we're vain
We know you're all robots, and we don't care
Tenacious D — We reign!
We reign
Supreme
Oh God
Burrito Supreme
And a Chicken Supreme
And a Cutlass Supreme
Supreme, yeah
Go now Kyle, 1-2-3
Supreme, yeah
Go now Kyle, 1-2-3
Supreme
Go now Kyle, 1-2-3
Burrito Supreme
And a Chicken Supreme
And a Cutlass Supreme
Supreme!11Embed
