Empathy Lyrics
You were wrong to resist me
I was wrong to forgive
Now I loathe my own weakness
But you praise me for this

There's a place in your future
Where the wound will be healed
And the children you injured
Will rise up, purified, then kill your name


You're afraid of the mirror
So you crawl on the floor
Where you count your perversions
Then you rise up
Filthy, with remorse

Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Uh huh huh
Ah
Ah
Ah
AhEmbed
