Red Velvet Wound Lyrics
And what do I do with the gift you have presented me
The one no one else would buy
They would not accept the filthy premise
Of your most terrible innocence
Oh, oh ho ho
So let them say, how you were wild
For what you really were was tender
Yes how you screamed, all through the night
Yet silent tears streamed down in morning light
Most beautiful, my lonely sinnerEmbed
