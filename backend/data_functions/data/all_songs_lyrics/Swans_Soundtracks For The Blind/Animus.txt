Animus Lyrics
Somewhere, through the frozen fields
Somewhere, beneath your pale and tender skin
Lies a house, absorbing fear and pain
Solar, red, contained, feeding on my dreams

Somewhere cold, inside the optic wire
Down where fingers and semen crack and bleed
There I will be, with my arms spread out and broken
Waiting for your breath, to animate my veins

We're not alone: all our thoughts are numbered
Malignant and cold, animal and hungry
But I will contain all that ever was or will be
Then I'll watch my skin erupt in a symphony of flames

Screaming out your name
Screaming out

Why can't I hide inside your malleable electric face?
You'd suck away the pain and swallow down my sickest dreams
Now my body feels like snow spilling out the shattered screen
Where will we be then when all the fear and blood are gone?
Drained into one hundred million open children's mouths
Screaming out your name
Screaming out
Screaming out3Embed
