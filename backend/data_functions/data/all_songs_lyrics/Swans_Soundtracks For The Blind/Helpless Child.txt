Helpless Child Lyrics
Now you be the mother and
I'll be your fool
I'll hide myself deep inside
Your crimson pool
The muddy water runs
Beneath your folds
You won't let me breathe;
You won't let me go
Now you'll be the stranger and
I'll be the white-skinned son
You'll blacken my innocence
With sugar and opium

The children were suffocating
Down in your damp cave
And you were the mother
And I was the sleeping slave
Protect me from violence
Hold me in your cool lips
You'll drug me with kindness
So I can pretend I exist
Now you be the only child
I'll suck on your breast
You'll feed me with gasoline
I'll burn my name in your head
