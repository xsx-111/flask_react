Minus Something Lyrics
There's been a lot of upsetting...
Very upsetting things
That I can't allow to happen any more
I have to be like a soldier and march away
Cause I'm very delicate in a lot of ways
And things get to me
And affect me in a very adverse... manner
I don't need that
Don't need that
I feel now like minus something, you know
I feel faded; I don't feel like I'm all here
I think it'll come back; I hope it'll come back
There's a lot of color missing, from the way I feel
And from ... my face, and, you know, just everything
There's some kind of zest, or some kind of, um ... life
You know, that seems to be faded temporarily
Because I've been so drained, emotionally
By a number of things
That has to slowly build back up
And then it has to be kept sustained
It cannot be allowed to be diminished
*sigh*
