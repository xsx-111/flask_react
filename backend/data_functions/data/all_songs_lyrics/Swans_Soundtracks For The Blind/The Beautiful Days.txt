You know, we do this for fifteen minutes or something
Talk to the man while he masturbates
You know, that was something I think--
I think I could do, you know
And of course, you know, you don't ever meet the man
Or see the man
You have to listen to him groan and say disgusting things
But I suppose these things are only disgusting
If that's the way you're looking at it3Embed
