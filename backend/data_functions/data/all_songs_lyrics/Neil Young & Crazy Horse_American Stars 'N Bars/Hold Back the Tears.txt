Hold Back the Tears LyricsHello, my old friend, it's good to see you smiling
You've been around so long, you must be strong
And single life really has its fine points
Like friends to help you out when things go wrong
Hold back the tears that you've been crying
Push off the fears when they come around
Hold back the tears and keep on trying
Just around the next corner may be waiting your true love
Two lying fools and then four crying eyes
Counting on one another to survive
Crazy love must surely have this pain
If getting up means going down again
Hold back the tears that you've been crying
Push off the fears when they come around
Hold back the tears and keep on trying
Just around the next corner may be waiting your true love
Hold back the tears that you've been crying
Push off the fears when they come around
Hold back the tears and keep on trying
Just around the next corner may be waiting your true love
Hold back the tears that you've been crying
Push off the fears when they come around
Hold back the tears and keep on trying
Just around the next corner may be waiting...Embed
