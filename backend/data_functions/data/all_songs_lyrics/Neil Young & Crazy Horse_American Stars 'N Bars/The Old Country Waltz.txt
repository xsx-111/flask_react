The Old Country Waltz LyricsThey were playing that old country waltz
In this empty bar, echoing off the wall
When I first got the bad news that you set me free
The band played the old country waltz to me
Well, I loved and I lost and I cried
The day that the two of us died
Ain't got no excuses, I just want to ride
While the band plays the old country waltz
Out the window the moon shines on the roofs of the cars
While I knock down tequila and salt
And the band plays the old country waltz
And we're playing it, that old country waltz
In this empty bar, echoing off the wall
Ain't got no excuses, we just want to play
That good old country waltz
I ain't got no excuses, I just want to play
That good old country waltz
That good old country waltzEmbed
