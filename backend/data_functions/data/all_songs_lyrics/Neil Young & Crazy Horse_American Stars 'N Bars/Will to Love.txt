Will to Love LyricsIt has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't there
Like an ocean fish who swam upstream
Through nets, by hooks, and hungry bears
When the water grew less deep
My fins were aching from the strain
I'm swimming in my sleep
I know I can't go back again
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
I'll never lose it
Never lose the will to love
Never lose the will
It's like something from up above
I can be like a fire in the night
Always warm and giving off light
But there comes a time when I shine too bright
Oh, I'm just a fire in the night
And now my fins are in the air
And my belly is scraping on the rocks
I still think someone really cares
And I'll keep swimming 'til I stop
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
It's like something from up above
Never lose the will to love
Never lose the will
I'm like a singer on the stage
With the golden lights and liquid rage
Down from the mountains to the sea
Cool running love keeps cleansing me
It keeps my gills from getting dry
But it distorts things in my eyes
Sometimes I see what really isn't there
Like my true lover, and I care
But I'll never lose
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
Never lose the will to love
It's like something from up above
Sometimes I ramble on and on
And I repeat myself 'til all my friends are gone
And get lost in snow and drown in rain
And never feel the same again
I remember the ocean from where I came
Just one of millions all the same
But somewhere someone calls my name
I'm a harpoon dodger and I can't, won't be tamed
But I'll never lose the will to love
Never lose the will to love
Got the will to love
Got the will to love
It's like something from up above
I'm not gonna lose the will to love
Baby, if I see boredom in your eyes
I'll know my river has run dry
But I won't turn back with that lonely tide
I bought that ticket and I'll take that ride
If we meet along the way, please sway beside me
Let us sway together, our tails together
And our fins and mind will leave this water
And let our scales shine
In the sun above and the sky below
So all the water and earth will know
It has often been my dream
To live with one who wasn't thereEmbed
