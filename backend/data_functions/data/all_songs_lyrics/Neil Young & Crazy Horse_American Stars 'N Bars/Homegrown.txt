Homegrown Lyrics
Woah, you sound like you've been playing together for ten years
Yeah, that was a nice jam

Homegrown's alright with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring

The sun comes up in the morning
And it shines that light around
One day, without no warning
Things start jumping up from the ground

Homegrown's alright with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring


Homegrown's alright with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring
Plant that bulb and let it glowEmbed
