Party of the Mind LyricsI invite you to the party of my mind
An invitation to the party of my mind
Some talk, some laugh, some go out for air
In the party of my mind, they'll all be there
All my friends will be there in the party of my mind
There's a room for us in the party of my mind
A place to be, a place to be found
A room without light, a room with lights that blind
These ideas I invite to the party of my mind
Won't you come in and invite love
Won't you come in, invite your anarchist friend
Won't you come in, anything can happen
Won't you come in, stay till the end
There's a disturbance over by the stairs
And her face looks round for me
Her eyes say something's going wrong
Some things aren't how they should be
I invite you to the party of my mind
An invitation to the party of my mind
Some talk, some cry, some go out for air
In the party of my mind we'll all be there
Everyone will be there
Everyone will be thereEmbed
