Calling the New Tune Lyrics
Up to and in-between you and me
Moving around our blind side
Had to listen so quietly
There's only whispers tonight

Calling the new tune
Calling the new tune
Does anybody hear the call?
Calling the new tune
Calling the new tune
Does anybody hear the call?

Looking for a change of heart
Just before we break
All the people who made a lot of noise
The wrong change to make

Calling the new tune
Calling the new tune
Does anybody hear the call?
Calling the new tune
Calling the new tune
Does anybody hear the call?
Calling the new tune
Does anybody hear the call?

Can you hear a call?
Can you hear the call?

Calling the new tune
Calling the new tune
Does anybody hear the call?
Calling the new tune
Calling the new tune
Does anybody hear the call?

Calling the new tune
Does anybody hear the call?Embed
