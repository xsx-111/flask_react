Song and Dance LyricsWhen you're lonely
You're looking for something
Thinking you can't win
You should sing !
When you're happy
Feeling complete
Found something
You should sing
Sing, sing, sing !
For a better way
We'll feel our way
To a better place
We should sing
We dance the night away
Then dance our lives away
We sing to keep the flame
For the things i want
I'll make you song and dance
Song and danceEmbed
