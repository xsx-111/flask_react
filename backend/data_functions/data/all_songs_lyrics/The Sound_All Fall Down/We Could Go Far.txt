We Could Go Far LyricsA given map, a taken way
Each sign points to
The end of the day
Frontiers laid
Down for life
But still our eyes ache
For a glimpse of the other side
We're learning good
Lies of this land
Promises held out
By an empty hand
We will know
Where we are
We could fall
We could go far
Yes, we could go far
We could go far
We could go far
We could go farEmbed
