Monument LyricsIs it fear, Is it fear
That you feel inside of you?
Is it fear?
Shouting out just fear
You feel inside of you
Is it fear that you feel
When all eyes are on you?
Is it fear?
Surely not just fear you feel
When all eyes are on you
Rise and rise
Rise above
Rise and rise
Not just a girl
Not just a girl, not just a building
For the skyline
Not just a girl, not just a building
For our eyes
Not just a girl, not just a building
But a monument to love
Rise and rise
Rise above
Rise and rise
We will never pull you down
No we shouldn't put you down
You're a monument to loveEmbed
