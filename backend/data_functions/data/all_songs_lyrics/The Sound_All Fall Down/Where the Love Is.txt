Where the Love Is LyricsI want your heart
At the end of this chase
I want to put that smile on your face
I want to take you to a secret place
Where the love is (3x)
Seems like the only cause
That is worth me fighting for
I just throw some light
On your cold floors
Where the love is (3x)
The strength of love is so strong and near
We've got a love so loud and clear
In a room on the floor with you
I want to be in that room with you
Because it's where the love is
Where all the love is (3x)Embed
