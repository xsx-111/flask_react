In Suspense LyricsThe sky is coming down
Where will i be found
When it hits the ground
When it hits the ground
My head is feeling
What my heart is beating
So far down there, far down there
Like everything else
I'm up in the air
I don't like the view i get
This city's torn
It's a useless map
We're hung by wires
That creak and slip
This is in suspense
This is in suspense
This is in suspenseEmbed
