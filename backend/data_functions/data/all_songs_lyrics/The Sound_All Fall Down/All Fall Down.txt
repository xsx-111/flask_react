All Fall Down LyricsThe simple notions
Of this damned nation
There's words on the page still
But where's all the rage gone?
All fall down, all fall down
Dance in the streets
Sing ring-a-ring-a-roses
Their disease is complete
With a pocket full of poses
All fall down, all fall down
Pack of cards, den of thieves
Safe as houses until the breeze
Just watch it all fall down
Just watch it all fall down
Don't turn the clock back
Break its hands off
Two minutes to midnight
Are you ready to collapse?
Ready to all fall downEmbed
