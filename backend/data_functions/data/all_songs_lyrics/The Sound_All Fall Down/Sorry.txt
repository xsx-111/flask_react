Sorry LyricsHow can we feel sorry
We live reality
Food we eat and the air we breath
We don't care enough to change
So how can we feel sorry?
How can we feel sorry
See it everyday
I pick up a paper
And i thrown it away.. and i say
How can i feel sorry?
How can i feel sorry?
How can i spare the time?
I've driven by the houses
It's a short road back to mine
Should be mine!
We think we know the cost
We have studied the effects
But have we seen the eyes survive?
The container has nothing left
Nothing left ..
No one left
No one to feel sorry! ooohaah!
One day i'll be sorry
I've turned against myself
With pins of guilt stuck in me
All that's left is someone else ..
Someone to feel sorry ..Embed
