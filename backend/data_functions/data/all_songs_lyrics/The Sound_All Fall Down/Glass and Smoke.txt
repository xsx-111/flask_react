Glass and Smoke Lyrics
The world is turning
The world is turning
Full speed, full moon
It'll be the right time
To get right out soon

The world is turning
Full speed, full moon
It'll be the right time
To get right out soon

We have killed our days, with boredom
We have killed our days, with boredom
Drank the hours, left them undone
We have killed our days, with boredom
Drank the hours, left them undone

When glass and smoke call
It's a farewell, a sad farewell
When glass and smoke call
It's a farewell, a sad farewell
We are lost in glass and smoke
We are lost in glass and smoke
Cut by glass, choked by smoke
Cut by glass, choked by smoke
We are lost in glass and smoke
Cut by the glass and choked by the smoke
We are lost in glass and smoke
I'm not stupid
I'm not stupid
I'm not stupid
I know i'm guilty
Going on a journey
You can't come with meEmbed
