As Feeling Dies LyricsI tried to get inside your skin
To feel your arms rattle through my arms
To feel you when i was in the room
The onus can be found with me
Nothing selfish
Made to protect the air
(chorus)
You kill me with your words
I kill you with my eyes
I was just a badly trapped history
We die as feeling dies
I never feel at home again
With words of spark loves escaped
Or the shelter from the rain
Are we mirrors to each others joys
Mirrors to each others plights
I die as you die
(chorus)Embed
