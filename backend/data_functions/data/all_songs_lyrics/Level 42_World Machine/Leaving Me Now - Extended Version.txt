Leaving Me Now - Extended Version Lyrics
It seems true love is so rare
Seems all I've known is deceit
Your laughter fills the air
Once more I'm sensing defeat

And I suppose you're leaving me now
I was so sure now I'm so full of doubt
And I suppose you'll be leaving this place
Just like the smile you wiped from my face
This time
(Ih)

I always gave my best
Your memory serves you so badly
Some people kill for less
Yet I'd still die for you gladly, so gladly

But I suppose it's my turn now
To play a scene that's familiar somehow
I turn the page and you walk away
Not even love could bring you to stay
This time
(Walk away)
(So easy)
Once more I'm learning
In the depths of my despair
Your lies confirming
True love is so rare


And I suppose it's my turn now
There's no more love only feelings of doubt
Gone with the hope your words have erased
Gone with the smile you've wiped from my face
Love is a ship we all hope to steer
Through troubled times 'cross an ocean of tears
A midnight sea that swells in your eyes
Takes just one look to know I'm still mesmerized
But I suppose you're leaving me now
I was so sure now I'm so full of doubt
I turn the page and you walk away
Not even love could bring you to stay
This time
Leaving me now
Leaving this placeEmbed
