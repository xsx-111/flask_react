World Machine LyricsSome folks try
To multiply
From sunrise to sunset
Leave behind
More of their kind
So no one will forget
But that ain't where I'm coming from - today
Those easy girls don't turn me on - anyway
I wanna know where my pride has gone
The party's over
Caught in a dream
Inside this world machine
Teachers teach
And preachers preach
Of spiritual evolution
But this big I am
From uncle sham
Just adds to my confusion
I've seen his face, I've heard his song - before
But I don't care what time he's on - anymore
I must have been on the streets too long
The party's over
Caught in a dream
Inside this world machine
I find myself outside your door
Trying to make it like before
But you don't follow what I say
And I can tell by your smile
You're no longer a child
That part of you was buried yesterday ...
... who knows
Why they come and where they go
In this world machine?
It's the chosen fools
Who make the rules
That don't apply to me
With their fast-car games
And counter claims
Not my reality
And I don't know if I belong - today
I don't know why my friends have gone - away
I must have been on the streets too long
The party's over
Caught in a dream
Inside this world machine
(don't knock the system - we'll knock some sense in you
Don't beat the system - there's nothing you can do)Embed
