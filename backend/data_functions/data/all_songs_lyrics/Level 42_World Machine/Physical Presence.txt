Physical Presence LyricsI leave as I enter
Another boy caught in-between
Now all I can muster
Are whispers to your screams
Don't you remember
How you eased my disgrace
Don't you remember
The love you saw in my face
Perfected in silence
A physical presence
Perfected in silence
A physical presence
I sought affection
But now I realize
A cold rejection
The movement in your eyes
But I can remember
When you shook against me
I can remember
When I saw what love could be
Perfected in silence
A physical presence
Perfected in silence
A physical presence
Ain't what she did
It's the way that she did it
When I couldn't give
Only she could forgive it
Ain't what she did
It's the way that she did it
As long as I live
It's for me to re-live it ...
Silence ...
Part of the answer
Is that there's really no escape
Part of the answer
Is that life can have such perfect shape
Don't you remember
All the nights you shared in my disgrace
Don't you remember
That the love that filled this empty space was ...
... perfected in silence
A physical presence
Perfected in silence
A physical presenceEmbed
