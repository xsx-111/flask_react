Question! Lyrics
Sweet berries ready for two, ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you, are you?
Sweet berries ready for two, ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you, are you dreaming?

Dreaming the night
Dreaming alright

Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?

Sweet berries ready for two, ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you, are you?
Sweet berries ready for two, ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you, are you dreaming?

Dreaming the night
Dreaming alright
Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Do we, do we know
When we fly?
When we, when we go
Do we die?

Yah
