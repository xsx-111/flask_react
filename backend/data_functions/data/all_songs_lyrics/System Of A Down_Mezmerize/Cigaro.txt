Cigaro Lyrics
Whoah

My cock is much bigger than yours
My cock can walk right through the door
With a feeling so pure
It's got you screaming back for

Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar

My shit stinks much better than yours
My shit stinks right down to the floor
With a feeling so pure
It's got you coming back for

Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Can't you see that I love my cock?
Can't you see that you love my cock?
Can't you see that we love my cock?

We're the regulators that de-regulate
We're the animators that de-animate
We're the propagators of all genocide
Burning through the world's resources, then we turn and hide

We're cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar

We're the regulators that de-regulate
We're the animators that de-animate

We're cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
Cool, in denial
We're the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar
My cock is much bigger than yours
My cock can walk right through the door
With a feeling so pure
It's got you screaming back for more15Embed
