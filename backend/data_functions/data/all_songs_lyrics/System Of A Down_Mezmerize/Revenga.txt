Revenga Lyrics
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink
Choking with a link, killing with a stink, just your mother's ho
Bleeding in a sink, poisoning a drink
Burning up, my sweet Clementine
Trampling a shrink, bleeding in a sink
Hallelujah wink, getting on the brink, just your mother's ho
Hallelujah wink, murdering a shrink, burning up

Oh, my sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
My sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

Killing with a stink, bleeding in a sink
Poisoning a drink, getting on the brink, just your mother's ho
Bleeding in a sink, trampling a shrink
Burning up, my sweet Clementine
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink
Choking with a link, killing with a stink, just your mother's ho
Poisoning a drink, bleeding in a sink, burning up

My sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
My sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, oh
I saw her laugh then she said
"Go away"
I saw her laugh then she said, then she said
"Go away, away"
Ah, ah-ah, ah, ah

My sweet revenge will be yours for the taking
It's in the making, baby, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
My sweet revenge will be yours, it's in the making
It's in the taking, making, baking, taking, faking
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

Ho, my sweet Clementine
Ho, shoulda been, coulda been, woulda been, woulda been you
Shoulda been, coulda been, woulda been, woulda been you12Embed
