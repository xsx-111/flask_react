Lost in Hollywood Lyrics
Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah

I'll wait here, you're crazy
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
You should've never gone to Hollywood
They find you, two time you
Say you're the best they've ever seen
You should've never trusted Hollywood

I wrote you and told you
You were the biggest fish out here
You should've never gone to Hollywood
They take you and make you
They looked at you in disgusting ways
You should've never trusted Hollywood

(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
I was standing on the wall Feeling ten feet tall
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
This is my front page, this is my new age
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave 'em like you just don't care
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave 'em like you just don't care
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Phony people come to pray, ah, ah
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Look at all of them beg to stay, phony people come to pray
(Ah, ah, the lines in the letter said, "We have gone to Hackensack")
Look at all of them beg to stay, phony people come to pray

(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
You should have never trusted Hollywood
(Ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah)
(Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
You should have never gone to Hollywood
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah)
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave 'em like you just don't care
You should've never trusted Hollywood18Embed
