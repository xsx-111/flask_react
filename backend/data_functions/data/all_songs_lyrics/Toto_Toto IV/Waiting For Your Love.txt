Waiting For Your Love Lyrics
Hands, don't let her go
Cause then the midnight icy winds will blow
Eyes, give every drop
This ain't the way that should have made her stop
Arms, just let her know
No one fills the place she used to grow
Smile, don't leave me now
Cause you're the reason she's here anyhow

Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
Cause if it breaks, she may not come again

I've been waitin' for your love
And it's been here all the time, right in front of me
I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time, it's been here, right in front of me

Look, forget your pride
She might kiss as you're like even tide
So, be in her heart
Especially when we're apart
Love, be by my side
Cause if she leaves there ain't no place to hide
Soul, be with her now
Cause you're the first one she knew anyhow
Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
Cause if it breaks, she may not come again

I've been waitin' for your love
And it's been here, all the time, right in front of me
I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time, it's been here, right in front of me


Words be gentle when you speak into her heart
Cause if it breaks, she may not come again

I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time, it's been here, right in front of me
Draw the line, I'll step across
Even further, I give in, you got me
I've been sitting, waiting for your love
And all the time, it's been here, right in front of me, yeah
Just separated by ten thousand miles
You're not alone, girl, you got me
Guess I needn't tell you, child, I'm not around
I'm inside, you got me
I've been waitin' for your love
It's been here, all the time, right in front of me, yeahEmbed
