Good for You LyricsIf you're dreamin'
Sun don't you rise
I've never been lost
So deep into eyes
I won't give out
Until you give in
But I know you must realize
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too, yeah
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too
Everyone knows
But they don't know why
How much will a smile
You satisfy
Stars gonna shine
The way that you feel
So there is no reason to wonder why
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too, yeah
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too, yeah
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, too, yeah
I could be good for you
You could be good for me, tooEmbed
