We Made It LyricsBad timing for love - you caught me on your birthday
I could feel your heart break into a hundred pieces
We were too torn apart, now it seems so senseless
And if we're clever, we'll put it together, it may be forever
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
Down on my luck, you arrived just in time, my angel
Thought you'd given me up, like a rhyme that needs no reason
I want you enough to keep my life untangled
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cos it may be forever
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
I want you enough to keep my life untangled
If we're clever, we'll put it together, 'cos it may be forever
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
We made it, made it, made it before, I know that we can make it again
If ever we'll make it, we're gonna make it girl
And I know we can take it, we got to take it, girl
If ever we can make it, we gotta make it
And I know we can take it...Embed
