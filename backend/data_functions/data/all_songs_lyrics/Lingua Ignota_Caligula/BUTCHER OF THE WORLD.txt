BUTCHER OF THE WORLD LyricsI'm the fucking death dealer
I’m the butcher of the world
Rise up and I'll cut you down
Rise up and I'll cut you
I’m the fucking death dealer
I'm the butcher of the world
If you don't fear me yet, you will
If you don't fear me yet
May your foes be many
May your days be few
May another steal
Steal what you stole
Steal what you stole
In return for my love
He strikes me down
Even as I make prayer for him
May your own shame hang you
May dishonor drown you
May there be no kindness
No kindness
No kindness1Embed
