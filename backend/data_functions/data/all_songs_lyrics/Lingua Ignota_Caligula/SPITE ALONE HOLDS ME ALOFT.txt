SPITE ALONE HOLDS ME ALOFT LyricsAll who proclaim their love betray me
Betray me
All who proclaim their love betray me
Betray me
All who proclaim their love
Let them hate me
Hate me
So long as they fear me
Fear me
Fear me
Fear me
All who proclaim their love betray me
Betray me
All who proclaim their love betray me
Betray me
All who proclaim their love
Let them hate me
Hate me
So long as they fear me
Fear me
Fear me
Fear me
Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft
Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft
Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft
Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft
Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft
Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
(Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft)
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
(Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft)
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
(Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft)
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
(Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft)
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
(Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft)
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
(Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft)
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
(Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft)
Kill them all
Kill them all
Kill them all
(Spite
Spite alone holds me aloft)1Embed
