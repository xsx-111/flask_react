MAY FAILURE BE YOUR NOOSE LyricsWho will love you if I don't?
Who will fuck you if I won't?
Who will love you if I don't?
Who will fuck you if I won't?
May failure be a garment to wrap 'round you
May failure be a belt with which to gird you
May failure be a noose with which to hang you
May failure be a noose with which to hang you
Who will love you if I don't?
Who will fuck you if I won't?
Who will love you if I don't?
Who will fuck you if I won't?
May failure be a garment to wrap 'round you
May failure be a belt with which to gird you
May failure be a noose with which to hang you
May failure be a noose with which to hang you
(You have cut me down
You have cut me down
I am gone like a shadow at evening
I am shaken off like the locust
I am losing
I am losing)
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down
Everything burns down around me
Everything burns down2Embed
