SORROW! SORROW! SORROW! LyricsGod alone knows my sorrow, sorrow, sorrow
God alone knows my sorrow, sorrow, sorrow
God alone knows my sorrow, sorrow, sorrow
God alone knows my sorrow, sorrow, sorrow
God alone knows my sorrow
And only He can judge
Today I fear nothing
For heaven is my consolation
Burn my body that I may not return
Disperse me to the air
That I may not be defiled by any other earthly thing
(I'm much happier when you're not in here)
Today I rejoice
(I can sit here and stew in my anger and my frustration)
(And my hatred all by myself)
Today I rejoice
(This fucking psychobabble horseshit)
(I'm afraid of changing what has worked)
(Twenty years of hatred)
God alone knows my sorrow (Now look at it)
And He will shelter me
God alone, God alone
God alone, God alone
God alone
God alone, God alone
Alone
Alone
Alone
