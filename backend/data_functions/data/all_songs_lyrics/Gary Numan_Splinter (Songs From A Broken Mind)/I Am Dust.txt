I Am Dust LyricsWe were dust in a world
Of grim obsession
We were torn from our
Life of isolation
We were pulled from the path
Of least resistance
And the songs we sang
What became of us?
We're here waiting for you
We're here waiting for you
We are yours
We're waiting for you
We are yours
We're waiting for you
We all pray for the end
For the god to take us
We were falling down
One by one
We were weak and the fear
Was all around us
The machines screamed from
Moon to sun
We're here waiting for you
We're here waiting for you
We are yours
We're waiting for you
We are yours
We're waiting for youEmbed
