A Shadow Falls on Me LyricsEvery time I felt that I understand
A shadow falls on me takes it away
Every time I try to walk away
A shadow falls on me tells me to stay
When will it end?
When will it end?
Every time I dream you will come home
A shadow falls on me, wake up alone
Every time I scream for someone to blame
A shadow falls on me, whispers my name
When will it end?
When will it end?
Every time I wake, locked in this room
A shadow falls on me tells me too soon
Every time I die, lead by your cry
A shadow falls on me and keeps me alive
When will it end?
When will it end?Embed
