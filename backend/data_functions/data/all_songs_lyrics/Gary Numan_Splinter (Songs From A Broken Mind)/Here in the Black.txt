Here in the Black LyricsHere in the black there's a feeling of loss
But it's hungry and restless
And it's looking, desperate for something
And it feels like a child but not screaming or helpless
And it's absent of mercy, it's alive and it feels
But not a shred of compassion or love
It comes like a pouring of evil, it's a stain on the ground
It's a desolate shadow of fear
It's dark and I'm lost, there's a breath in the wind
And the breath is malicious
And I don't know whether to run
Or should I drop to my knees and pretend I'm religious?
Because it's cold and I'm scared
And the whispers are a madness that forces a question to God
Is this real or imagined?
Because if I'm asleep, well then I don't need to scream for long
Here in the black it comes
Here in the black it comes
Here in the black it comes for me
Here in the black I'm lost
It's here and I'm found, like a thought in the mind
But it's beautifully vicious and I can't hide, not sure if I want to
It crawls in the mist like a vision of Judas and it's
So close I can feel it, and I'm chilled to the bone like a statue in ice
But it's unsure if it's enough so it waits for the ghost
For the demon assassin of God
Here in the black it comes
Here in the black it comes
Here in the black it comes for me
Here in the black I'm lost
And all you see is dark and vague
And all you feel is life unmade
And all your hopes just bleed away
And all you are is lost and fades
Here in the black it comes
Here in the black it comes
Here in the black it comes for me
Here in the black I'm lostEmbed
