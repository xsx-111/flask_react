The Calling LyricsYou don't hear me
You don't see me
You don't even know I'm alive
So why do you call me?
I love young things
And they need me
What on Earth can I do for you?
So, why do you call me now?
You don't love me
You don't love me
Is this some kind of game for you?
Is that why you've called me?Embed
