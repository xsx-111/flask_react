My Last Day LyricsI'd like to watch you grow tall, it can never be
Kiss you to sleep but I know it can never be
Wipe away all of your tears, it can never be
Wait here to see a sunrise I will never see
Ooh ooh it comes
Ooh ooh it comes
Ooh ooh it comes
Ooh my last day
I'd like to mend every hurt, it can never be
Be there to catch every fall, it can never be
Be there to love every thing you will ever be
Sleep now, wish you sweet dreams, I will never see
Ooh ooh it comes
Ooh ooh it comes
Ooh ooh it comes
Ooh my last dayEmbed
