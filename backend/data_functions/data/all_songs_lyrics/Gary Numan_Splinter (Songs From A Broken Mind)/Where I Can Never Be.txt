Where I Can Never Be LyricsAnd nothing I say
And nothing I can make
And nothing I do will ever bring you back to me
And all that we love
And all that we hope for
And all that we dreamed is lost and slowly fades away
You are
Still breathing, so
You are
Where I can never be
And all that I was
And all that I wanted
And all that I could've been is gone, turns to stone
And I am not here
And I am not real
But I am still calling out your name to guide you home
You are still breathing inside
You are
Where I can never be
Where I can never be
Sometimes I'm evil
Sometimes I see you
Sometimes I feel you
Inside I'm dying youngEmbed
