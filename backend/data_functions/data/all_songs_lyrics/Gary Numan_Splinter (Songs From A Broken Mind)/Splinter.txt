Splinter LyricsI believe in the cruelty of man
I believe in all of the hopeless and lost
I see you
I believe in the shamed, the faithless like me
I believe everything falls through the greed of man
I see you
I see you
Do you believe in the beauty of love?
Or that heaven is vengeance disguised?
He sees you
Do you believe we will pay for our sins?
I believe everything's learned from the scars of man
I see you
I see you
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
Life isn't everything
I don't believe in the calling of God
I don't believe a word of The Word is true
I see you
I don't believe in the goodness of people like me
I believe everything bleeds from the fear of man
I see you
I see youEmbed
