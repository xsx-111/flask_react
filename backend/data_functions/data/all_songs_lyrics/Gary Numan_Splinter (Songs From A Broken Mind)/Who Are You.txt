Who Are You LyricsI don't think I've ever seen your face
Who are you?
Who are you?
And I don't think I've ever heard your voice
Who are you?
Who are you?
I don't think I'll ever touch your heart
Who are you?
Who are you?
And I don't think I've ever known your name
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
And I don't think I've ever seen your smile
Who are you?
Who are you?
And I don't think I've ever heard the truth
Who are you?
Who are you?
I don't think I've ever shared your dreams
Who are you?
Who are you?
I don't think I've ever known you at all
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
I don't think I've ever seen your face
I don't think I've ever heard your voice
I don't think I've ever touched your heart
I don't think I've ever known your name
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let go
Who
So let goEmbed
