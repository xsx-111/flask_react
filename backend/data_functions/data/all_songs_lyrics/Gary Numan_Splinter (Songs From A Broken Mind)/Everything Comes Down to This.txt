Everything Comes Down to This Lyrics
This isn't easy, but it's what I believe
Something is broken, and twisted, and pushes away
No one is listening, what have we done?
I feel the empty of "darkness and lonely" again

I don't know how this is going to end
I don't know how this is going to change
I don't know how this is going to feel
But everything comes down to this

Nothing is easy. No one is calm
Love is a stranger that hides in the corner of sane
So much unspoken, words left for dead
All I can hear is the screaming of someone to blame

I don't know how we let this go so far
I don't know how we let love turn to pain
I don't know how we let things fall apart
But everything comes down to this

I don't know how this is going to end
I don't know how this is going to change
I don't know how this is going to feel
But everything comes down to this
I don't know how we let this go so far
I don't know how we let love turn to pain
I don't know how we let things fall apart
But everything comes down to this2Embed
