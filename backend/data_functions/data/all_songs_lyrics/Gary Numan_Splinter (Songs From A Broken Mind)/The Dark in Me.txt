The Dark in Me LyricsCan you feel me close to you?
Can you hear me pray for you?
Can you taste my need for you?
Can you see Iâ€™m here with you?
Ho ho ho ho ho ho
Me my shame
Ho ho ho ho ho ho
Me my shame
Can you feel me touching you?
Can you hear me call for you?
Can you taste my love for you?
Can you see I hurt for you?
Be my shame
Be my shame
I can feel the pain in me
I can hear the lies in me
I can taste the fear in me
I can see the dark in me
Be my shame
Be my shameEmbed
