Love Hurt Bleed Lyrics
I've seen all I want
I've seen all I need
I've seen everything
I know everything bleeds

Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds

I've hurt things I love
I've hurt things to fear
I've hurt everything
I know everything bleeds

Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Do, do you know my name?
Do, do you know what I've shamed?
Do, do you think I'm lost?
Do, do you think I care?
Everything bleeds

Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleeds
Everything bleedsEmbed
