Little House of Savages LyricsSomebody's waiting for me at home
Somebody's waiting for me at home
I should have known
I should have known
And somebody's got a car outside
Somebody's got a car outside
Let's take a ride
Let's take a ride
Somebody's waiting for me at home
Somebody's waiting for me at home
I should've known
I should've known
Ah, wake up
And somebody's got a car outside
Somebody's got a car outside
Let's take a ride
And I know that it's late, but I don't wanna go
Somebody's waiting for me at home
I should've told
I should've told
'Cause you can run and have your fun
But don't come around when she gets home
Oh, baby, don't go run off
There's a door in the hall and it's open tonight
Come on in and I got you tonight
I should have chose
I should have chose
'Cause you can run and have your fun
But don't come around when she gets homeEmbed
