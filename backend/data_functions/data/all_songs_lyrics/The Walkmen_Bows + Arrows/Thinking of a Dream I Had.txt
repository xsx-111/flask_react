Thinking of a Dream I Had LyricsI'm waiting on a subway line
I'm waiting for a train to arrive
I'm thinking of a dream I had
I'm thinking of a dream I had
Maybe you're right
We're gonna have a good time tonight
When you're coming around, you'll be sorry for the plans we made
And when you're coming around, you'll be sorry for the things you said
Don't lead me on
Don't lead me on
Don't lead me on
Don't...
Don't...
And when you're coming around, you'll be sorry for the things you said
And when no one speaks to me that way, I'll be hanging from the ceiling fan
Maybe you're right
I'm waiting on a subway line
I'm waiting for a train to arrive
I'm thinking of a dream I had
I'm waiting for a train to arriveEmbed
