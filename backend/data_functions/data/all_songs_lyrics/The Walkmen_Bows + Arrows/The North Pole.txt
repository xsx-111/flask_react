The North Pole LyricsMaybe it's not good and it's not bad
And maybe that's a problem that we have
'Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows
I've seen you with your new boyfriend
It's funny how you look at him
I know we won't be seeing him again
'Cause everybody knows
That's the way it goes
And everybody knows
Your Monday morning train takes you uptown
Your Friday evening bus brings you back down
I've seen you with your new boyfriend
It's funny how you look at him
I know we won't be seeing him again
'Cause everybody knows
Everybody knows
Your Monday morning train takes you uptown
Your Friday evening bus brings you back down
It's times like these that you say you want out
It's all you seem to ever talk about
So here's what they're saying
I'm sincerely yoursEmbed
