The Rat Lyrics
You've got a nerve to be asking a favor
You've got a nerve to be calling my number
I know we've been through this before
Can't you hear me? I'm calling out your name
Can't you see me? I'm pounding on your door

You've got a nerve to be asking a favor
You've got a nerve to be calling my number
Can't you hear me? I'm bleeding on the wall
Can't you see me? I'm pounding on your door
Can't you hear me when I'm calling out your name?

When I used to go out, I would know everyone that I saw
Now I go out alone, if I go out at all
When I used to go out, I'd know everyone I saw
Now I go out alone, if I go out at all
When I used to go out, I'd know everyone I saw
Now I go out alone, if I go out at all

You've got a nerve to be asking a favor
You've got a nerve to be calling my number
I'm sure we've been through this before
Can't you hear me? I'm beating on the wall
Can't you see me? I'm pounding on your door9Embed
