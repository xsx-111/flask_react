My Old Man LyricsHere we are
Come see us driving in your car
And the morning's dim
Break it off with him
You said something there
Something throws me from my chair
I refuse to talk this out
'Cause I don't need this now
You're a sure thing, but I know
I don't need this now
You're an old friend, we both know
I could take you out
And last night, I did something that I don't want to hear
Bring your sister out
We'll be leaving now
And all fun stops here
And it's buzzing in my ear
Bring your sister out
We'll be leaving now
You're a sure thing, but I know
You can count me out
You're an old friend, we both know
I could take you out
I see it now
I see it slow
I see it now
I see it now
Here we are
Come see us driving in my car
And take a spin
Break it off with him
You said something there
Something throws me from my chair
Bring your sister out
We will be leaving now
You're a sure thing, but I know
You can count me out
You're an old friend, we both know
I could take you outEmbed
