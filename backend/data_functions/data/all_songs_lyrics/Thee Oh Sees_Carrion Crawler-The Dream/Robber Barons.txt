Robber Barons Lyrics
Whiff, a hint
Burnt family
Robber barons
High up they see
They crush and kill
Most certainly
A toad, a road
Homes and cities

Wait, a plan
So simple, see
We turn our backs
On kings and queens
The land, the sea
Majestically
They are yours
You are free

Whiff, a hint
Burnt family
Robber barons
High up they see
They crush and kill
Most certainly
A toad, a road
Homes and cities1Embed
