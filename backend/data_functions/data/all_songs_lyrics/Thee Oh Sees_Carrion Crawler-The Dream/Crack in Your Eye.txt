Crack in Your Eye Lyrics
I hold the key
An honest life
A crack in your eye
I'm told that we are living in a world of flies

I breathe the air of simple men
It blows like blood
And scenes, they soar upon the breeze
Like bells and horns

I hold the key
An honest life
A crack in your eye
I'm told that we are living in a world of fliesEmbed
