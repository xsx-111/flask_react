Heavy Doctor Lyrics
They got us high
With only water
Strung out on news
A heavy doctor
Clean out my eyes
Sick as I oughta
Poured in my mind
These opened coffers

Reeling from the stink of factories
Alive but mighty sick I am to be
My-my, my-my, say
Ah-ah-ah!..

Witness the eye
That's all they want to see
The skull, the smile
A cloud of sulfur
Wickedly seized
That's how the lovers died
It's just a breeze
Upon a blood-rich sea
They got us high
With only water
Strung out on news
The heavy doctor
Clean out my eyes
Sick as I oughta
Poured in my mind
These opened coffers

Reeling from the stink of factories
Alive but mighty sick I am to be
My-my, my-my, say
Ah-ah-ah!..Embed
