Wrong Idea Lyrics
The wolf is panting at my door
Pawing at the floor
When I am bitten
I'll be eaten

Blood was pooling near the door
Soaking in the floor
Then I am rotting...
Then forgotten

The wolf is panting at my door
Pawing at the floor
When I am bitten
I'll be eaten

Blood was pooling near the door
Soaking in the floor
Then I am rotting...
Then forgottenEmbed
