Contraption/Soul Desert Lyrics
Contraption every night
Paint out the lights
It stops all the feel ups
That go under the tables

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah...

And I am destination
The jewel of a song
A well cut appetite
A spread that has been wasted

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah...
So, pull your nets right in
Find a couch or table
And recreate the zero
You suspect you are

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah...
Is that what they say?
Ah-ah, ah-ah...

You're from the soul, soul desert
You're from the soul
You're from the soul, soul desert
From the soul

La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
You're from the soul, soul desert
You're from the soul
You're from the soul, soul desert
From the soul

La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la

You're from the soul, soul desert
You're from the soul
You're from the soul, soul desert
From the soul

La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-laEmbed
