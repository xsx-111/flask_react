Opposition Lyrics
Opposition, always hoped up
Anti-squishy, always worried
Half-time mess up, over rational
Operation, open surgery

Move, move
Move, move, sorry!

Admiration, estuary
Want some kiss up, always worried
Operation, hope incision
Laceration, always sorry
I am weary, over cursing
Acid seizure, always hurting
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.....

Move, move
Move, move, sorry!


Move, move
Move, move, sorry!Embed
