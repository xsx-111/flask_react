The Dream Lyrics
I had a dream, a dream I said
A bloody dream in which I said:
"I'm not dead, oh dead"
I lie awake until I sleep, I see the sky tear, and then it weeps
I was scared
So scared
I had a dream, a dream I said
A bloody dream in which I said:
"I'm not dead, oh dead"
I lie awake until I sleep, I see the sky tear, and then it weeps
I was scared
So scared

The dream, is seeking, is peeking, into real life
The sun can't burn, the dream, from my eyes
The﻿ dream, seeking, peeking, real life
The dream, is seeking, is peeking, into real life
The sun can't burn, the dream, from my eyes
The﻿ dream, seeking, peeking, real life
The dream, is seeking, is peeking, into real life
The sun can't burn, the dream, from my eyes
The﻿ dream, seeking, peeking, real life
The dream, is seeking, is peeking, into real life
The sun can't burn, the dream, from my eyes
The﻿ dream, seeking, peeking, real life
The dream, is seeking, is peeking, into real life
The sun can't burn, the dream, from my eyes
The﻿ dream, seeking, peeking, real life5Embed
