Carrion Crawler Lyrics
Eat meat, fill me with holes
Pick teeth using my bones
Knock-knock the wood of the door
Hungry head inside my home

La-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la

Eat meat, fill me with holes
Pick teeth using my bones
Knock-knock the wood of the door
Hungry head inside my home1Embed
