Wasted LyricsIt always falls apart when the lights turn on
You can't feel your legs, can't feel your face
Everybodys gone
Youre wasted x 2
You feel no pain
It all adds up to nothing
Over and over again
Youre wasted
Youre already gone
Youre wasted
Now theres nothing left to bring you down
Youre hanging from the basement ceiling
Got youre feet off the ground
Youre wasted x 2
Its never going stop
Sob story of a bleeding heart
Its going to hurt when you hit rock bottom
I can't take it x 8
Youre wasted
Youre already gone
Youre wasted
Youre already goneEmbed
