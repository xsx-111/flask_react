Rats LyricsYou don’t know what it is x 2
You can’t find it
You’ve been hearing a sound
Crawling around in your mind
You’ve been hearing a sound x 3
They’ve been crawling around again
You don’t where it is x 2
You can’t find it
You’ve been hearing a sound
Crawling around in your mind
You’ve been hearing a sound x 3
They’ve been crawling around again
You don’t know
You’re in deep
It’s too late
You can’t sleep
You got rats x 4Embed
