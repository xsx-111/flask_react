Sad Pricks LyricsDon’t want to wake up in the morning
I’ve got to clear my head
I’m getting pulled in a million directions
I should’ve stayed in bed
Don’t want to know (Everyday there is something wrong) x 4
Don’t want to watch the television
Or pick up the phone
So many different people talking at me
Why don’t they leave me alone?
Don’t want to know (Everyday there is something wrong) x 4Embed
