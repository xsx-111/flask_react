Negative Space LyricsSpace, feels like I’m floating in space
I’ve got to get out of this place
Turn, don’t know which way I should turn
I’ve got a hand out, You’re going to burn
I can’t take it
I got a hole in my head
I can’t take it
I got a hole in my head
Pill, don’t wanna swallow the pill
I’ve got to check out
Can’t believe I’m here still
I turn it up
Upside downEmbed
