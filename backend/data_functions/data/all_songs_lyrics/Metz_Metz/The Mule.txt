The Mule LyricsI don’t know what to do
I can’t decide
I haven’t got a clue
I’m going to stay inside
It don’t make no sense
I’ve got no excuse
Just going to change my mind
So what’s the use?
Against the wall
I see your face
I’m thinking of another time
Another place
I don’t know what to do
I’m going blind
Can’t get it straight man
I’ve been left behind
It don’t make no sense
I’m blaming you
I haven’t got a clue
I haven’t got a clue
I don’t know what to do
I’m going blind
Can’t get it straight man
I’ve been left behind
Against the wall
I see your face
I’m thinking of another time
Another place
I haven’t got a clue x 2Embed
