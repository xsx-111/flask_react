Wet Blanket LyricsWoo!
I'm passed out on the floor
I wish you would
Stop the room from spinning 'round
Your eyes are burning and there's nothing I can do about it
You'll never be the same
You'll never be the same
Wet blanket
I'm waiting in the dark
Can't hold it in
Please, please give me what I need
My patience is wearing thin
You'll never be the same
You'll never be the same

Ahh!
