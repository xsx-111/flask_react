Headache LyricsBlurry vision
Can't see
Heavy breathing and it's standing right in front of me
I can't move, I can't stand
I gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta
Get away
Get away
I gotta get away
Get away
Got nothing
In mind
Something missing and I'm throwin' out the bottom line
I can't move, I can't stay
I gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta
Get away
Get away
I gotta get away
Get awayEmbed
