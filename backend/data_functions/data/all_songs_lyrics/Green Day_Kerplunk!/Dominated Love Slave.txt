Dominated Love Slave Lyrics
I wanna be your dominated love slave
I wanna be the one that takes the pain
You can spank me when I do not behave
Smack me in the forehead with a chain

'Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep (Come on!)

(Whoo!) Want you to slap me and call me naughty
Put a beltsander against my skin (Woohoo!)
I wanna feel pain all over my body (Come on, now!)
Can't wait to be punished for my sins

'Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive them staples deep

Come on!
Woohoo!
Hey, Bo!
Goin' again
Whoo!
My pickup truck
'Cause I love feelin' dirty
And I love feelin' cheap
And I love it when you hurt me
So drive... staples?!3Embed
