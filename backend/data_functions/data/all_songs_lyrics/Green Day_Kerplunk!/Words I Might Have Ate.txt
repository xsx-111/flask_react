Words I Might Have Ate Lyrics
Now it seems I can't keep my mind above you
My brain drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktops of the school grounds
The love I bitched about, I finally had found

But now it's gone and I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

Now I dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me, I am blind without a cause
And now I realized what I have lost

It was something real that I could've had
Now I play the fool whose stable soul's gone bad
Why?

Tell me what the words I might have said
That's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late?
Just tell me the words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
The words I might have ate
But now it's gone and I take the blame
But there's nothing I can do but take the pain
Why?

Why? Why?
Why? Oh why?
Why? Why?2Embed
