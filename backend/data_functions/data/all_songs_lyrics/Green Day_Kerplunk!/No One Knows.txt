No One Knows Lyrics
Why should my fun have to end?
For me, it's only the beginning
See my friends begin to age
A short countdown to their end

Don't call me irresponsible
Don't call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again, 'cause no one knows

I don't want to cause no harm
But sometimes, my actions hurt
Is there something I should find
To make plans for forever?

Don't call me irresponsible
Don't call me habitual
But when you think of me
Do you fill your head with schemes?
Better think again, 'cause no one knows

Call me irresponsible
Call me habitual
(Does it seem like all your memories fade?)
But when you think of me
(You soak up knowledge to fill the space)
Do you fill your head with schemes?
(Yet still, my answer remains; I don't know)
Better think again, 'cause no one knows
I don't...4Embed
