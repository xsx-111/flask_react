Android Lyrics
Hey old man in women's shoes, I
Wonder if he knows I think he's crazy
When he was young did he have dreams of
Wearing women's shoes and being crazy?

It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change?
Or will I grow that old? Will I still be around?
The way I carry on, I'll end up six feet underground and waste away

When the old man was in school
Did the golden rules make him go crazy?
Or did he hide away from hopes
Behind a smile and smoking dope? It's crazy

It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change?
Or will I grow that old? Will I still be around?
The way I carry on, I'll end up six feet underground and waste away

And it seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning
Before you know it, you're struck down
I always waste my time on
My chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around
And waste away...

It seems so frightening
Time passes by like lightning
Before you know it, you're struck down
I always waste my time on
My chemical emotions
It keeps my head spinning around
Waste away...1Embed
