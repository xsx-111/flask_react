Sweet Children Lyrics
Sweet young girl, so soft and blonde
Does exactly what she's been warned
Intoxications in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain
Believing all his faith through lies
Putting his hands onto her thighs
Impurity has now been gripped
He takes away her innocence

Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
Remember when?

Ooh, Johnny Ray is running again
As he hits the floor again
Running from the light of day
Or maybe lie and celebrate
The slightest urge goes from his hand
Follow me if you understand
He's got the trigger of his gun
The final sin and now he runs
Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
Remember when?


Sweet children
Sweet children
Sweet children
Remember when?Embed
