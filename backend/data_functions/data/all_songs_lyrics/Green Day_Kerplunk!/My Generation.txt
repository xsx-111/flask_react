My Generation Lyrics
Well, people try to put us down
Talkin' bout my generation
Just because we get around
Talkin' bout my generation
The things they do look awful cold
Talkin' bout my generation
I hope I die before I get old
Talkin' bout my generation
My generation

Why don't you all just fade away?
Talkin' bout my generation
And don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm just talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
My generation

Heineken, fuck that shit!

Why don't you all just fade away?
Talkin' bout my generation
And don't try to dig what we all say
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation
Talkin' bout my generation
I'm just talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
My generation
Talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
Generation
Talkin' bout my generation
Talkin' bout my generation
