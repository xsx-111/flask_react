Private Ale Lyrics
Wander down these streets all by myself
Think of my future now, I just don't know
Well, I don't seem to care
I do notice that I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there?

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins, temptation flows
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah

So I sit down here on the hard concrete
Think of my future now, I just don't know
Well I don't seem to care
I stop to notice that I'm by your home
I wonder if you're sitting all alone
Or is your boyfriend there?

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins, temptation flows
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, oh-oh-oh

Because I feel so right
Let my imagination go
Until you're in my sights
And through my veins, temptation flows
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh yeah
Whoa-oh-oh, oh yeah1Embed
