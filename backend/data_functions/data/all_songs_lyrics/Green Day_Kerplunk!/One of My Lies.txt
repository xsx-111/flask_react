One of My Lies Lyrics
When I was younger, I thought that the world circled around me
But in time, I realized I was so wrong
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future
It was a tragic case of my reality, yeah

Do you think you're indestructible and no one can touch you?
Well I think you're disposable and it's time you knew the truth

'Cause it's just one of my lies
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I wanna do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies

Why does my life have to be so small, and death is forever?
And does forever have a life to call its own?
Don't give me an answer 'cause you only know as much as I know
Unless you've been there once, well I hardly think so

Do you think you're indestructible and no one can touch you?
Well I think you're disposable and it's time you knew the truth
'Cause it's just one of my lies!
Well, it's just one of my lies
And all I wanna do is get real high
Well, it's just one of my lies

I used to pray at night
Before I lay myself down
My mother said it was right
Her mother said it too... Why?2Embed
