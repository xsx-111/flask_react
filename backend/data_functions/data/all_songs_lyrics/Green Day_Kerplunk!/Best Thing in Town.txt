Best Thing in Town Lyrics
Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me out to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout

'Cause I know that you're the best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that you're the best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

I'm seeing faces
Of mysteries of the earth
I know not one
But the aggressions of my birth
Or go to stance
Of solutions I can't find
A missing piece
Of a thought that's in my mind

Come with me and let's go for a ride
Follow me to the other side
As I sit around and watch you pout

'Cause I know that you're the best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

Running wild and always running free
Exploring things that I have never seen
Eerie colors and all I see are sounds

Now I know that you're the best thing in town
Best thing around
Best thing in town
Best thing around

I'm sick and growing tired of always playing this shit!Embed
