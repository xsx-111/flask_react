Female Vampire Lyrics
Transient
Restless
I'm not there
Or not there yet

But if I'm coming I must be hollow enough
I follow the body, I mustn't rest
When I'm near you become someone else

I'm so tired
Of subjectivity
I must justify
My presence by losing it

Must not keep a steady gaze
Keep a steady gaze
When I'm near you become someone else

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
A strange slow rhythm
Not exactly creating a rhythm
Here it comes
In and out of focus
(Here it comes)
Vulnerable, the original crevasse
(Here it comes)
In a moment
Of confusion
I don't know what to say
And I hear myself ask:

Where does it hurt to create curves for the gaze?
The body as a subconscious
And desire takes place somewhere, everywhere, everywhere

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
(In the dampness of)
Here it comes
(Winter air between us)
Here it comes
(In the restlessness of hotel rooms)
Here it comes
(The smell of Spanish wetlands)
Here it comes

In the way you say:
It hurts everywhere1Embed
