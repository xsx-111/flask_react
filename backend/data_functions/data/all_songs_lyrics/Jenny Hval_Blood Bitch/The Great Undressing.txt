The Great Undressing Lyrics
It's fruit with cake and like, cinnamon, it's very fruity and good
What's this album about, Jenny?
It's about vampires
No!
Yeah
What?
Well, it's about more things than that but, a large theme of it isâ€”
That is so basic. "It's about vampires!"
It's about blood...

Like capitalism
It works like unrequited love that way
It never rests
Just like I need the love I'm not getting from you
And all the people in the world
Are in-between you and I in that way
And in the way of love

You must be disgusted
But I need to keep writing because everything else is death
I'm self-sufficient, mad, endlessly producing
I don't need money, I just need your love
Or your approval, anything
Like capitalism
It works like unrequited love that way
It never rests
Just like I need the love I'm not getting from you
And all the people in the world
Are in-between you and I in that way
And in the way of love

Any sign is a promise of love, of being exposed
A staged ritual undressing taking a place of consummation
I'm here writing, working, making myself
Available for love
Making myself available for love
Because I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you

I just need a sign
Any recognition is a reward
Because I love youEmbed
