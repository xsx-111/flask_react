Conceptual Romance Lyrics
And sometimes I dream you've left me
And I'm so lost I wake up high
High on madness
A sexual holding pattern
Stuck in erotic self-oscillation
This landmine of a heart
The only one I've ever had
I've ever had

Conceptual romance is on my mind
I call it abstract romanticism
Conceptual romance is you
It's you and I
It's you and I

This blood bitch's tale
It goes a bit like this:
I lose myself in the rituals of bad art, in failure
I want to give up but I can tell
My heartbreak is too sentimental for you

Conceptual romance is on my mind
I call it abstract romanticism
Conceptual romance is you
It's you and I
It's you and I
So I lose my gaze to keep you
Creating a curve for the eyes
A rejected body
And losing it is constant, but such a lonely place
What can I say?
I don't know who I am, but

I'm working on it
I'm working on it
I'm working on it
I'm working on it
I'm working on it

I'm high, high on madness
These are my combined failures
I understand infatuation, rejection
They can connect and become everything
Everything that's torn up in your life
But come with me, I want to show you something
The original wound, the origin

(I'm working on it)
Of the world
(I'm working on it)
Of the world
(I'm working on it)
Of the world
(I'm working on it)
(I'm working on it)
Of the worldEmbed
