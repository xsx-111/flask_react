Lorna LyricsAnd I've never known pleasure like this
What is this desire
This biting
Eating into another person
What is this that can't be contained in you
I feel full of holes
Separate
And when I wake up, I see red flowers on the bed
No one ever asked me: How do I desire?
I don't think anyone ever talked to me
Using the word "desire" at all
No one ever told me or taught me not to contain it
It kept existing, but there was no language
Does anyone have any language for it?
Can we find it?Embed
