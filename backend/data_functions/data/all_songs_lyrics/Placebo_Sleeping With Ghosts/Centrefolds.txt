Centrefolds LyricsCome on Balthazar I refuse to let you die
Come on fallen star I refuse to let you die
Cause that's wrong and I've been waiting far too long
It's wrong I've been waiting far too long
For you to be... be... be... be... be mine
For you to be mine... be mine... for you to be mine
And it's wrong, I've been waiting far too long
It's wrong, I've been waiting far too long
For you to be... be... be... be
All the centerfolds that you can't afford
Have long since waved their last good-byes
All the centerfolds that you can't afford
You've long since faded from their eyes
So be... be mine 1Embed
