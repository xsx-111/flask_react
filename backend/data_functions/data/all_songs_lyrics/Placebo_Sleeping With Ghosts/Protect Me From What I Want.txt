Protect Me From What I Want Lyrics
It's the disease of the age, it's the disease that we crave
Alone at the end of the rave, we catch the last bus home
Corporate America wakes, Coffee Republic and cakes
We open the latch on the gate of the hole that we call our home

Protect me from what I want, protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want, protect me, protect me

Maybe we're victims of fate, remember when we'd celebrate?
We'd drink and get high until late, and now we're all alone
Wedding bells ain't gonna chime with both of us guilty of crime
And both of us sentenced to time, and now we're all alone

Protect me from what I want, protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want, protect me, protect me
Protect me from what I want, protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want, protect me, protect me

Protect me from what I want, protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want, protect me, protect me
Protect me from what I want, protect me from what I want
Protect me from what I want, protect me, protect me
Protect me from what I want (Protect me, protect me)
Protect me from what I want, protect me, protect me3Embed
