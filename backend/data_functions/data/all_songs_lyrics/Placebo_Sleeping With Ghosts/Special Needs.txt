Special Needs Lyrics
Remember me when you're the one who's silver screened
Remember me when you're the one you always dreamed
Remember me whenever noses start to bleed
Remember me, special needs

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior

Remember me when you clinch your movie deal
And think of me stuck in my chair that has four wheels
Remember me through flash photography and screams
Remember me, special dreams

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Remember me
Remember me

Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
Just 19, a sucker's dream
I guess I thought you had the flavor
Just 19, a dream obscene
With six months off for bad behavior
