Something Rotten Lyrics
Can`t believe, it seems we're here
I miss you something rotten
The stinks are here
It's guaranteed all is forgotten

Down here, down here
It's clear that you are uncut
Don't fear, don't fear
Keep all this forgotten

Face down, face down
Face down, I miss you something rotten
Face down, face down
This crown is broken rotten

Down here, down here
I know it`s not, it's all forgotten
Down here, down here
Face down, I miss you something rotten

Down here, down here
It stinks, it stinks of something rotten
Don't fear, don't fear
Keep all this forgotten


There's something rotten down here
There's something rotten down here
There's something rotten down here
There's something rotten down hereEmbed
