Near You Always Lyrics
Please don't say I love you
Those words touch me much too deeply
And they make my core tremble
Don't think you realize the effect you have over me
Please don't look at me like that
It just makes me wanna make you near me always

Please don't kiss me so sweet
It makes me crave a thousand kisses to follow
And please don't touch me like that
Makes every other embrace seem pale and shallow
And please don't come so close
It just makes me wanna make you near me always

Please don't bring me flowers
They only whisper the sweet things you'd say
Don't try to understand me
Your hands already know too much anyway
It makes me wanna make you near me always

And when you look in my eyes
Please know my heart is in your hands
It's nothing that I understand, but when in your arms
You have complete power over me
So be gentle if you please 'cause
Your hands are in my hair, but my heart is in your teeth, babe
And it makes me wanna make you near me always

Your hands are in my hair, but my heart is in your teeth, babe
And it makes me wanna make you near me always

I wanna be near you always
I wanna be near you always
I wanna be near you alwaysEmbed
