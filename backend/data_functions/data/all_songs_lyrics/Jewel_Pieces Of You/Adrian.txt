Adrian LyricsAdrian came home again last summer
Things just haven't been the same around here
And people talk
And people stare
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
An unfortunate accident in a canoe
Doctor said, "I'm sorry not much I can do"
And the air was so still
And his eyes, they did not blink
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
Little Mary Epperson liked him
And she vowed always to watch after him
But he still did not move
And the doctor said, "It's no use"
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
She sat by his side and watched the years fly by
He looked so fragile, he looked so small
And she wondered why he was still alive at all
Everyone in town had that "I'm-so-sorry look"
They talked in a whispered hush, said
"I'd turn the machines off"
But still she sat by his side
She said, "Life, he won't be denied"
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
Yellow flowers decorate his bedroom
Sign above his door says, "Welcome Home"
But he just sits and stares
He's awake but he's still not there
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
And she sat by his side, and watched the years fly by
He looked so fragile, he looked so small
And she wondered why he was still alive at all
And little Mary Epperson grew up lovely
And she still comes to visit him on Sundays
He's like an unused toy
He's got big hands but the mind of a little boy
Oh, Adrian, come out and play
Adrian came home again last summer
Things just haven't been the same around hereEmbed
