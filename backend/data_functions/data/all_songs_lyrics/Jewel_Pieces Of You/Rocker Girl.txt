Rocker Girl LyricsI went downtown just to see
If there was a rocker boy made for me
Tight pants and long brown permed hair
Preferably zebra striped underwear
He's gonna rock my world
Be his rocker girl
Gonna be his rocker girl
I love the way that he gives all the guys shiners
'Cause it sort of matches my blue eyeliner
He's so tough, he's so cute, he's a regular dream
He looks so good in his acid washed denim jeans
He's gonna rock my world
Be his rocker girl
He will know all the good movies
He'll know just how to rock it to me
He'll be so romantic and that
He'll know every word to Spinal Tap
And I'll be his rocker girl... two, three, four
If he was Russian, he would be the Kremlin
If he was a rock star, he would be Led Zeppelin
If he was a month he would be oh, say, May or June
If he was underwear he would be Fruit of the Loom
He's gonna rock my world
Be his rocker girl
Gonna be his rocker girl
Gonna be his rocker girlEmbed
