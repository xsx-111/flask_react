Cold Song Lyrics
It's getting cold and I'm starting to sneeze
I wipe my nose on my sleeve
I've got the sniffles, I'd better drink my tea
Oh, do you, do you wanna, wanna catch a cold with me?

I'd catch a cold with you anytime
I ain't just feverish, I ain't just lyin'
'Cause when your nose is running
It's a perfect time for kissing and hugging
Oh, do you, do you wanna, wanna catch a cold with me?

We'll stay inside where it's nice and warm
Tell our bosses, we're caught in a sneezing storm
We'll sniffle and snuggle and watch some more tv
Oh, do you, do you wanna, wanna catch a cold with me?

I'd catch a cold with you anytime
I ain't just feverish, I ain't just lyin'
'Cause when your nose is running
It's a perfect time for kissing and hugging
Oh, do you, do you wanna, wanna catch a cold with me?
Do you, do you wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna
Do you, do you wanna
Do me, yes, indeed
Oh, do you, do you wanna, wanna catch, have a cold with me?Embed
