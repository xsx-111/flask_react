Morning Song Lyrics
Let the phone ring, let's go back to sleep
Let the world spin outside our door
You're the only one that I wanna see
Tell your boss you're sick, hurry
Get back in, I'm getting cold
Get over here and warm my hands up
Boy, it's you they love to hold
And stop thinking about what your sister said
And stop worrying about it, yes, the cat's already been fed
Come on, darlin', let's go back to bed

Put the phone machine on hold
Leave the dishes in the sink
Do not answer the door
It's you that I adore
I'm gonna give you some more

We'll sit on the front porch, the sun can warm my feet
You can drink your coffee with sugar and cream
I'll drink my decaf herbal tea
Pretend we're perfect strangers and that we never met
My, you remind me of a man I used to sleep with
That's a face I'd never forget
And you can be Henry Miller and I'll be Anais Nin
Except this time, it'll be even better
We'll stay together in the end
Come on, darlin', let's go back to bed
Put the phone machine on hold
Leave the dishes in the sink
Do not answer the door
For you, I'd be a poor man's wife
I'm gonna give you some more

Let the phone ring, let's go back to sleepEmbed
