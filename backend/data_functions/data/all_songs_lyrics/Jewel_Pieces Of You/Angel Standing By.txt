Angel Standing By Lyrics
All through the night
I'll be watching over you
And all through the night
I'll be standing over you

And through the dreams I'll be
Right there, baby, telling you
Everything is gonna be all right
And when you cry I'll
Be there, baby, telling you
You were never nothing less than beautiful

So, don't you worry
I'm your angel standing byEmbed
