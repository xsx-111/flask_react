Daddy LyricsMy bones are tired, Daddy
I don't get enough sleep
I don't eat as good as I should, Daddy
What's that say about me?
You know, sometimes I sleep past noon, Daddy
I drink lots of black coffee and I smoke like a chimney
Yes, I left the refrigerator door half open, Daddy
What's that say about me?
You know, sometimes I wanna to rip out your throat, Daddy
For all those things you said that were mean
Gonna make you just as vulnerable as I was, Daddy
What's that say about me?
You know sometimes I want to bash in your teeth, Daddy
I'm gonna use your tongue as a stamp
I'm gonna rip your heart out the way that you did mine, Daddy
Go ahead and psychoanalyze that
'Cause I'm your creation, I'm your love, Daddy
Grown up to be and do all those sick things you said I'd do
Well, last night I saw you sneak out your window
With your white hood, Daddy
What's that say about you?
I'm sloppy, what's that say about you?
I'm messy, what's that say about you?
My bones are tired, DaddyEmbed
