Crazy Mixed-Up Kid LyricsMy friends tell me she'll be back some day
Until then, I'll have to find a way
I've tried so very hard to be
Someone she'd fall in love with
I cry my eyes out, she's no good
It's true and I know it
I guess she's just a crazy, mixed up kid
Everybody says she'll come around
Until she does, you know, I won't be found
I've tried so very hard to be
Someone she'd fall in love with
I cry my eyes out, she's no good
It's true and I know it
I guess she's just a crazy, mixed up kid
I won't compromise
I won't look in her eyes
It seems unfair
That girls like her don't even care
My friends tell me she'll be back some day
Until then, I'll have to find a way
I've tried so very hard to be
Someone she'd fall in love with
It hurts to love a girl
When she don't even wanna know you
I guess she's just a crazy, mixed up kid
Mixed up kid
Mixed up kid
Mixed up kid
