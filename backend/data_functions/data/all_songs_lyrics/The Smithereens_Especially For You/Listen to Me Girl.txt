Listen to Me Girl LyricsListen to me, girl
I've been so lonely
Want you so bad, girl
I want you only
Listen, listen to me, girl
Listen to me, now
I'm thinking of you
Listen to my heart
I really love you
Listen, listen to me, girl
Listen!
Sometimes, I wonder just what she is doing
Wasting my time with her lies
I know that someday she'll drive me to ruin
She plays around while love dies
Maybe tomorrow, you'll see it my way
There'll be no sorrow, only the bright day
Listen, listen to me girl
Listen, listen to me girl
Listen, listen to me girl
Listen to me girl
Listen to me girl
Listen to me girl...Embed
