Time and Time Again LyricsI've tried everything
I've looked everywhere
Tried to find someone like you
My own loves all wrong
Girl you know I'm not that strong
How can I tell her we're through?
Each time we make romance I keep thinkin' bout no one but you
Each time I hold her I seem to get colder and I just don't know what to do
Time and time again, time and time again, time and time again
Will I ever learn?
I've done everything trying to get next to you
You still got nothing to say
You won't stay with me, tell me that you must be free
I guess I'll just go my own way
Every time I take her hand I keep thinkin' bout no one but you
Each time I hold her I seem to get colder and I just don't know what to do
Time and time again, time and time again, time and time again
Will I ever learn?
Each time I meet a girl I keep hoping that she'll be like you
But once I know her well I start looking for somebody new
Time and time again, time and time again, time and time again
Will I ever learn?
When will I ever learn? When will I ever learn?Embed
