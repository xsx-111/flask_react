White Castle Blues LyricsSaturday night and it's gettin' late
I'm gettin' hungry, I just can't wait
Not just any kind of burger will do
I'm being hit by those
White Castle blues
White Castle blues
I think I'll get some crisp onion rings
To compliment 10 of those little square things
An orange soda or a milkshake will do
I'm being hit by those
White Castle blues
White Castle blues
I was first introduced to those bastards by Duke
On a hot summer night when we went out to cruise
But memories such as Bobbo and puke
Are just part of the saga of
White Castle blues
Saturday night and it's gettin' late
I'm gettin' hungry, I just can't wait
Not just any kind of burger will do
I'm being hit!
Hey! (x8)
