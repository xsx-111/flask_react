Groovy Tuesday LyricsWoke up on a groovy Tuesday
Even my hangover's fine
Woke up on a groovy Tuesday
Hung my mind out on the line
Tuesday's groovy, Tuesday's groovy
Now I know that nothing lasts
Woke up on a groovy Tuesday
Everything is not the same
Woke up on a groovy Tuesday
Think I'll even change my name
Tuesday's groovy, Tuesday's groovy
Now I know that nothing lasts
And I can't help it if I'm not the one you need
It doesn't matter if I'm still the lost ball in the weeds
Woke up on a groovy Tuesday
Flower pot man looked my way
Woke up on a groovy Tuesday
I can see what he can't say
Tuesday's groovy, Tuesday's groovy
Now I know that nothing lasts
Tuesday's groovy, Tuesday's groovy
Now I know that nothing lasts
Nothing lasts
Nothing lasts
Nothing lasts
Tuesday's groovy
Tuesday's groovy
Tuesday's groovy
Nothing, nothing lasts
Nothing, nothing lasts
Nothing, nothing lasts
Nothing, nothing lasts
Nothing, nothing lastsEmbed
