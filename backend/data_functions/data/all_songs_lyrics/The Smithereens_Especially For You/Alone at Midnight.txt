Alone at Midnight LyricsShe's written in the wind
I see her face everywhere I go
She follows me in my dreams
I wake with teardrops on my pillow
Love comes and goes
Everybody knows
I'm alone at midnight
I spoke with her on the phone
It's been three years since we said hello
The years flow by like a dream
We talked a while, then she had to go
Love comes and goes
Everybody knows
I'm alone at midnight
Teardrops are falling along down
My heart is calling to you
Midnight is calling. I hear the sound
So sad and lonely for you
If you see her around
Won't you please tell her I said hello
The years flow by like a dream
I wake with teardrops on my pillow
Love comes and goes
Everybody knows
I'm alone at midnightEmbed
