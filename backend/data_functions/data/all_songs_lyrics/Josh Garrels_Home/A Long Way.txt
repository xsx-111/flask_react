A Long Way Lyrics
There's a time in our lives
To return, sacrifice
Wild grass has grown high
On the path between our lives
There's a light in the trees
It's closer now, I'm on my knees
Oh Father, forgive me, please

I came a long, long way back home
To see you one more time
'Cause I came a long, long way back home
To see you and say goodbye

Father's hands work the ground
Turns the soil, and lays it down
Everything done and said
Lives beyond the quick and the dead
Heritage passed along
To the sons like a blessed song
So raise your voices on high tonight

We came a long, long way back home
To see you one more time
We came a long, long way back home
To see you and say goodbye
We came a long, long way back home
To see you one more time
We came a long, long way back home
To hold you and say goodbyeEmbed
