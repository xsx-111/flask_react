Colors Lyrics
Lift up your shoulders child
Breathe in
Carry the weight of love
You've been given
Storm is passing by
Light breaks in
As you learn to sing

Every color can
Be unwound
Woven into a wave
Of beautiful sound
Open the heavenly's and
Shake the ground
And change the world

So let all the creatures sing
Praises over everything
Colors are meant to bring
Glory to the light

Voices might fade away
And begin
Become a tapestry
We all are in
No one will ever be
Forgotten
There's a place for us
So let all the creatures sing
Praises over everything
Colors are meant to bring
Glory to the light

So let all the creatures sing
Praises over everything
Colors are meant to bring
Glory to the throne

This is our story
This is our song
We're telling it slowly all life long
Of a Savior and what He's done
It's a mysteryEmbed
