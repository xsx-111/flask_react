Benediction Lyrics
May all of your days shine brightly
And your nights blessed with peace
Wherever you lay down to sleep
And all things are made good
For those who believe
May you grow from a seed
Into a strong, fruitful tree

As the days unfold
Hold your breath to see
Life is a mystery
And joy, it is severe
When the way is rough and steep
But love will make your days complete

And may the work of your hands help those in need
Befriend the lonely, serve the weak
And forgive enemies
And if you find true love, one day marry
Bear a child from your seed
Help it to grow into a tree

As the days unfold
Hold your breathâ€‹ to see
Life is a mystery
And joy, it is severe
When the way is rough and steep
Love will make your days completeEmbed
