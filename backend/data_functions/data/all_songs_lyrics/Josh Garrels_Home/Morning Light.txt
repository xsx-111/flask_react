Morning Light Lyrics
There's a place, a garden for the young
To laugh and dance in safety among
The shimmering light in the shade of the trees
But steal a bite and paradise is lost
With darkened hearts, we didn't count the cost
Forgot all we left behind

Life picks up speed before you know
We hold on for dear life, Oh Lord
We're too proud to turn back now
One day it all falls down
It breaks our heart and it breaks our crown
It brings us down where we see

It's gonna be alright
Turn around and let back in the light
And joy will come
Like a birdie in the morning sun
And all will be made well
Once again

There's a way that seems right to a man
'Til he's in over head and he don't understand
All the plans he made only led him astray
But every good gift come down from above
From the Lord of light like a labor of love
Upon the child waits who for him
Sometimes you find what you're waiting for
Was there all along just waiting for you
To turn around and reconcile
And it may be broken down
All the bridges burned
Like an old ghost town
But this, my Son, can be made new

Cause it's gonna be alright
Turn around and let back in the light
And joy will come
Like a birdie in the morning sun
Where all will be made well
Once again

Said it's gonna be alright
Shake it out and let back in the light
And joy will come
Like a birdie in the morning sun
And all will be made well
And all will be made well
And all will be made well
Once againEmbed
