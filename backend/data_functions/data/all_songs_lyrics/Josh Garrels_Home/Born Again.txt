Born Again Lyrics
I came to the world, to the wild
No place for a child
Used my voice to howl
With the ghouls of night
In the dying light
I had to learn to get what I need
In the dark, empty
Instincts are guiding me
Like a beast to some blood
And I can’t get enough

I’m losing control; my body, my soul
Are slowly fading away
But I’m ready now
To feel the power of change

I’m my mother’s child
I’m my father’s son
It took me awhile
But my time has come
To be born again
To be born again
Running scared in between what I hate
And what I need
Savior and enemy are both trying
To take my soul
And I can’t hide no more
Stumble out into the light
And raise my fist up to fight
Then I catch your eyes
So full of love
Lord, what have I done?

I cry at your feet, wounded for me
And all of the monsters and men
But here in your light
We can begin again

I’m my mother’s child
I’m my father’s son
It took me awhile
But my time has come
I’m my mother’s child
I’m my father’s son
Lord took me awhile
But my time has come
To be born again
To be born again3Embed
