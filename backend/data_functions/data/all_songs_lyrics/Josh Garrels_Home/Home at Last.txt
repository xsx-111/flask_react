Home at Last Lyrics
Who is there at the end of lonesome roads?
All of us hope there's a home
A place to rest where wounds get dressed, the table's full
The sound of laughter in the halls

Light the fire, gather 'round
Join together, sing it loud
Raise the glass and joyful be
Home at last, one family

We're all orphans looking for an open door
Hard times come no more
Come on up to the house of the Lord
Father adopts us all

Light the fire, gather 'round
Join together, sing it loud
Raise the glass and joyful be
Home at last, one familyEmbed
