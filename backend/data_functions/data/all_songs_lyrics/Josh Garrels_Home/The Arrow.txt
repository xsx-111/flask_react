The Arrow Lyrics
An arrow is stuck between my ribs
And I pray to God, don't let it end like this
I fought like a man with will to live
But I was betrayed by the man within

How on earth did it all go down like this?
I've got no words to make sense of it
My shield, my fight for righteousness
Could not protect me from myself

I'm looking for the higher power
To be my mighty tower
Save me from myself, Oh yeah
But I'm-a fall seven more times
And it ain't nobody's fault except mine
There's only one way out

Please, Lord, forgive me
I'm down on my bended knees
And I need your love
Mercy is your medicine
Help me turn around again
To You, my friend
How long did I fool myself
Believing I, I didn't need nobody's help
A fool trusts in his power and his wealth
Until he's brought down low
Unto a shadow of himself

The arrow was sent to intervene
It pierced my bones and shook me from my dream
Lord, â€‹You know exactly what I need
Wounds from a friend, severe mercy

I'm looking for the higher power
To be my mighty tower
Save me from myself, Oh yeah
But I'm-a fall seven more times
And it ain't nobody's fault except mine
There's only one way out

Please, Lord, forgive me
I'm down on my bended knees
And I need your love
Mercy is your medicine
Help me turn around again
To You, my friendEmbed
