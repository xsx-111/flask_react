Alleyways Lyrics
If things were different, we were young
Skinny dipping, having fun, I remember
Back in 1991, when the story first begun, I remember (I remember)

All of these shells, holding the things I've done
I knew myself before I knew anyone (I did, I did)
And 'cause we all chew gum, we all have fun with water guns
La-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-dum-dum-dum
Then we all grew up, shit got tough, shit just wasn't simple enough, no

And whenever the sun came out, we played
(We didn't want to get older, we didn't want to get older)
We would run on the block all night and day
(We didn't want to get older)

What a mistake saying the way I felt
I'd say my main influence is myself
And 'cause I started young, I learned a ton, I didn't run
La-da-da-da-da-da
I was scared as fuck and out of touch, and I was still testing my luck, oh

And whenever the sun came out, we played
(We didn't want to get older, we didn't want to get older)
We would run on the block all night and day
(We didn't want to get older, we didn't want to get older)
And whenever the sun came out, we played
(We didn't want to get older, we didn't want to get older)
I left myself in the alleyway
If things were different, we were young
Skinny dipping, having fun, I remember
(I left myself in the alleyway)
All I wanted would become everything I ever loved, I remember
(I left myself in the alleyway)19Embed
