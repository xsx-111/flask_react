Staying Up Lyrics
No food to eat
All the money's been wasted from last week
I can't even leave
So I sit in the basement, making up rad beats
Hot cup of tea
It's four o'clock in the middle of the night and I can't sleep
It's all on the peak
So bad I can taste it while it eats me

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?
I just have nightmares
How can it be?
I still believe something is out there

Some part of me
Feels a little bit naked and empty
I'm stuck underneath
A few dirty old blankets to comfort me

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?
I just have nightmares
How can it be?
I still believe something is out there
How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?
I just have nightmares
How can it be?
I still believe something is out there
And there's a light
And I can see why I'm still alive
Mommy won't lie
'Cause if she did, I would've died
All the time I sit and try
You think I'd be tired
Every night, I'm sick and why?
Ohh, I'm staying up this time

How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?
I just have nightmares
How can it be?
I still believe something is out there
How can I sleep if I don't have dreams?
I just have nightmares
How can it be?
I still believe something is out there
(Something is out there)30Embed
