Float Lyrics
Imagine breathing in
Imagine leaving all your air behind
What matters in the end
A matter of opinion 'til you find out

Life can only mean hardly anything
All I'll ever be is partly settled in

They show you how to swim
Then they throw you in the deep end
I've been learning since
But it doesn't mean I'll float, oh, no
I won't float, no, no, no, no, won't float

I had a funny sleep
I didn't have a dream 'cause I don't believe in them

Life can only mean hardly anything
All I'll ever be is partly settled in

They show you how to swim
Then they throw you in the deep end
Well, I've been learning since
But it doesn't mean I'll float, oh, no, no, no
I won't float, no, no, no, no, no, no
Float away
Float away, then come right back to me
Float away
Float away, then come right back to me

They show you how to swim
Then they throw you in the deep end
Well, I've been learning since
But that doesn't mean I'll, oh
They show you how to swim
Then they throw you in the deep end
Well, I've been learning since
But it doesn't mean I'll float, no, no, oh, no
I won't float

What if I, what if I don't float?
What if I don't float?
I think I'll float
I'll float
I'll float away18Embed
