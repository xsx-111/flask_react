How Lyrics
How could you question God's existence
When you question God himself?
Why would you ask for God's assistance
If you wouldn't take the help?

If you're gone then I need you
If you're gone then how is any of this real?
When I'm on I believe you
When I'm not, my knees don't even seem to feel

How could you tell me that I'm great
When they chewed me up, spit me out and pissed on me?
Why would you tell me that it's fate
When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?

They say the end is coming sooner
But the end's already here
I said today is but a rumor
That we'll laugh at in a year
Or two, or three, or four, or five, whatever

If you're gone then I need you
If you're gone then how is any of this real?
When I'm on I believe you
When I'm not, my knees don't even seem to feel
How could you tell me that I'm great
When they chewed me up, spit me out, pissed on me?
Why would you tell me that it's fate
When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?
How could you tell me that I'm great
When they chewed me up, spit me out, pissed on me?
Why would you tell me that it's fate
When they laughed at me, every day, in my face?

How?
How could you tell me that I'm great?
How?
How could you tell me that it's fate?
