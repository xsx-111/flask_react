If Everyone Was Listening Lyrics
The actors and jesters are here
The stage is in darkness and clear
For raising the curtain
And no-one's quite certain whose play it is

How long ago, how long?
If only we had listened then
If we'd known just how right
We were going to be

For we dreamed a lot
And we schemed a lot
And we tried to sing of love
Before the stage fell apart

If everyone was listening, you know
There'd be a chance that we could save the show
Who'll be the last clown
To bring the house down?
Oh no, please no, don't let the curtain fall

Well, what is your costume today?
And who are the props in your play?
You're acting a part which you thought from the start
Was an honest one
Well how do you plead?
An actor indeed!
Go re-learn your lines
You don't know what you've done
The finale's begun

If everyone was listening, you know
There'd be a chance that we could save the show
Who'll be the last clown
To bring the house down?
Oh no, please no, don't let the curtain fall1Embed
