Dreamer Lyrics

Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!
I said, dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!

I said, "far out, what a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well, you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot I can do

Dreamer, you stupid little dreamer
So, now you put your head in your hands, oh no!
Woo!

I said "Far out, - What a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well, you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot I can do

Well, work it out someday
If I could see something
You can see anything you want, boy
If I could be someone
You can be anyone, celebrate, boy
Well, if I could do something
You can do something
If I could do anything
Can you do something out of this world?
Take a dream on a Sunday
Take a life, take a holiday
Take a lie, take a dreamer
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream along
Dreamer, come on and dream and dream along
Come on and dream and dream along (a little)
Dreamer, come on and dream and dream along
Come on and dream and dream along
Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!
I said, dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!
Oh no!3Embed
