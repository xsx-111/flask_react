Crime of the Century LyricsNow they're planning the crime of the century
Well what would it be?
Read all about their schemes and adventuring
Yes it's well worth the fee
So roll up and see
As they rape the universe
How they've gone from bad to worse
Who are these men of lust, greed and glory?
Rip off the masks and let's see
But that's not right - oh no, what's the story?
Look! There's you and there's me
(That can't be right...)9Embed
