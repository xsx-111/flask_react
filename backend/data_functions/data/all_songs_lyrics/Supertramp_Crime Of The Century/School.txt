School Lyrics

I can see you in the morning when you go to school
Don't forget your books, you know you've gotta learn the golden rule
Teacher tells you stop your playing and get on with your work
And be like Johnnie-Too-Good, don't you know he never shirks
He's coming along

After school is over, you're playing in the park
But don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about
And grow up just like them, won't let you work it out
And you're full of doubt


Don't do this and don't do that
What are they trying to do? (Make a good boy of you)
And do they know where it's at?
But don't criticize, they're old and wise
Do as they tell you to, don't want the devil to
Come and put out your eyes
Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right
But while I am still living, I've just got this to say
It's always up to you if you wanna be that
Wanna see that, wanna see it that way
You're coming along6Embed
