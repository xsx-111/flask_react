Rudy Lyrics
Rudy's on a train to nowhere;
Halfway down the line
He don't wanna get there
But he needs time
He ain't sophisticated
Or well-educated
After all the hours he's wasted
Still he needs time
He needs time
He needs time for livin'
He needs time
For someone just to see him
He ain't had no lovin'
For no reason or rhyme
And the whole world's above him
Well, it's not as though he's fat
Nah, there's more to it than that
See he tried to play it cool;
Wouldn't be nobody's fool
Rudy thought
That all good things
Comes to those that wait
But recently
He could see
That it may come but too late
All through your life
All through the years
Nobody loved
Nobody cared
So dim the light
Dark are your fears
Try as I might
I can't hold back the tears
How can you live?
Without love, it's not fair
Someone said give
But I just didn't dare
What good advice
Are you waiting to hear?
Hearing's alright
For them that's all there
Hearing's alright

You'd better-
You'd better gain control now
You'd better show 'em all now
You'd better make or break now
You'd better give and take now
You'll have to push and shove now
You'll have to find some love now
You'd better gain control now
Now he's just come out the movie
Numb of all the pain
Sad, but in a while he'll soon be
Back on his train2Embed
