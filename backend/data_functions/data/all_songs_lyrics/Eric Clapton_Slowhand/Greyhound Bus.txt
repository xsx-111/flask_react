Greyhound Bus LyricsRidin’ on a Greyhound bus
Tomorrow never seemed to gone
I hear your voice, see your face
I don’t know where it’s coming from
Voices on the wind, ringing in my mind
People passing by
I think they don’t know why
I am everywhere you are
I need you close to me
I am everywhere you are
I need your company
Ridin’ on a Greyhound bus
Fields of green pass by
It seems I’m almost there
Sunsets in the sky
Dreams I spend at night
Running through my mind
Things I like to do, things I left behind
I am everywhere you arе
I need you close to me
I am evеrywhere you are
I need your company
I am everywhere you are
I need you close to me
I need your company
I need your company
I need your company
I need your companyEmbed
