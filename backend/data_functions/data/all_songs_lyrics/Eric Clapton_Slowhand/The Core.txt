The Core Lyrics
Every morning when I wake
Aa feeling soon begins to overtake me
Ringing in my ears resounds through my brain
It finally surrounds me
There is fire, there is life
There is passion, fever and fury
There is love and there is hate
There is longing, anger and worry

Oh, I have a flame, feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel

If it should become too cold
I know I can endure the frostbite
Oh, a blanket then I'll wrap around me
I keep myself so close to my side
No one then can cause me harm
Just as the river runs into the sea
Because every day, your fire alarm
Is deafening the silence all around me

Oh, I have a flame, feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel
It is burning
It is burning

You can trust me, we can laugh
Together we can share our sorrow
I will give you secrets too
An attitude that you may borrow
Gypsy woman said to me
One thing you must bear in your mind
You are young and you are free
But damned if you're deceased in your own lifetime

Oh, I have a flame, feel it touch my heart
And down at my core is the hottest part
I can burn without fuel

It is burning
It is burningEmbed
