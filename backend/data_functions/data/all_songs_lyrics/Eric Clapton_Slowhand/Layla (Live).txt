Layla (Live) Lyrics
What do you do when you get lonely
Nobody's waiting by your side?
You've been running, hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, begging, darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please donâ€™t say we'll never find a way
Tell me all my love's in vain
Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?


Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
Layla, you got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please
Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?Embed
