May You Never Lyrics
May you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper, if you get hit in a barroom fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

Well, you're just like a great, strong sister to me
And I know that your love is true
And you hold no blade for to stab me in my back
I know that there's some that do

So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind?
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Please, won't you please bear it in mind for me?

May you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper, if you get hit in a barroom fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

Well, you're just like a great, strong brother to me
And I know that your love is true
And you never talk dirty behind my back
I know that there's some that do
So please, won't you please, won't you bear it in mind?
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Please, won't you please bear it in mind for me?

May you never lay your head down without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper, if you get hit in a barroom fight
May you never lose your woman overnight

May you never lose your woman overnight
May you never lose your woman overnightEmbed
