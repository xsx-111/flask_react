Stormy Monday Lyrics
They call it stormy Monday, yes but Tuesday's just as bad
They call it stormy Monday, yes but Tuesday's just as bad
Wednesday's even worse, Thursday's awful sad

The eagle flies on Friday, Saturday I go out to play
The eagle flies on Friday, but Saturday I go out to play
Sunday I go to church where I kneel down and pray

And I say, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
Just trying to find my baby, won't you please send her on back to me
