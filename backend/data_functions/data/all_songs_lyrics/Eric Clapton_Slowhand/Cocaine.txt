Cocaine Lyrics
If you want to hang out
You've got to take her out
Cocaine
If you want to get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

If you got bad news
You want to kick the blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
And you wanna ride on
Cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine

If your day is gone
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back
Cocaine

She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
