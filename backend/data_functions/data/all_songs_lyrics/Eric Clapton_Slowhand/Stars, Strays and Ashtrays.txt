Stars, Strays and Ashtrays LyricsThere are song you can never remember
Songs that you cannot forget
There are people always forgiving
Has heaven forgiven me yet?
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you her own
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they can always be found
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you her own
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they can always be found
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you around
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they can always be found
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you around
Just likе stars, strays and ashtrays, they can always be found. Yes!
Just likе stars, strays and ashtrays, they called you around
Just like stars, strays and ashtrays, they'll never let you downEmbed
