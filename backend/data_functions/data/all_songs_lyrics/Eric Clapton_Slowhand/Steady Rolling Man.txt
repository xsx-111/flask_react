Steady Rolling Man LyricsI am a steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day
I am a steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day
But I ain't got no sweet woman
Woo hoo Lord
To be rollin' this way
I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree
I am the man that rolls
When icicles are hanging on the tree
Why can't you hear me begging mama?
Woo hoo Lord, down on my bended knee
I am a steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day
Steady rollin' man
And I roll both night and day
But I ain't got no sweet woman
Woo hoo Lord
To be rollin' this wayEmbed
