Further On Up The Road Lyrics
Further on up the road
Someone's going to hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road
Someone's going to hurt you like you hurt me
Further on up the road
Baby, just you wait and see

You got to reap just what you sow
That old saying is true
You got to reap just what you sow
That old saying is true
Just like you mistreat someone
Someone's going to mistreat you
You been laughing, pretty baby
Someday you are going to be crying
You been laughing, pretty baby
Someday you are going to be crying
Further on up the road
You will find out I was not lying
