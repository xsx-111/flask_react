Badge Lyrics
Thinking about the times you drove in my car
Thinking that I might have drove you too far
And I am thinking about the love that you laid on my table
I told you not to wander around in the dark
I told you about the swans, that they live in the park
Then I told you about our kid, now he is married to Mabel
Yes, I told you that the light goes up and down
Do not you notice how the wheel goes around?
And you better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down
Yes, before they bring the curtain down

Talking about a girl that looks quite like you
She did not have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell off the cradleEmbed
