Tell the Truth Lyrics
Tell the truth, tell me who has been fooling you?
Tell the truth, who has been fooling who?

There you sit there, looking so cool
While the whole show is passing you by
You better come to terms with your fellow men soon, because

The whole world is shaking now, can't you feel it?
A new dawn is breaking now, can't you see it?

It does not matter just who you are
Or where you are going or been
Open your eyes and look into your heart


Hear what I say, because every word is true
You know I would tell you no lies
Your time is coming, going to be soon, boyEmbed
