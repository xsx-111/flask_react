Wonderful Tonight (5.1 mix) LyricsIt's late in the evening
She's wonderin' what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up
And brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"
We go to a party
And everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady
Is walkin' around with me
And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"
I feel wonderful
Because I see the love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realise
How much I love you
It's time to go home now
And I've got an achin' head
So I give her the car keys
And she helps me to bed
And then I tell her as I turn out the light
I say, "My darlin', you were wonderful tonight
Oh, my darlin', you were wonderful tonight"Embed
