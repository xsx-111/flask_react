Cocaine (5.1 mix) LyricsIf you wanna hang out
You've got to take her out, cocaine
If you wanna get down
Down on the ground, cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
If you got bad news
You wanna kick them blues, cocaine
When your day is done
And you wanna run, cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
If your thing is gone
And you wanna ride on, cocaine
Don't forget this fact
You can't get it back, cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
Cocaine
She don't lie
She don't lie
She don't lie
