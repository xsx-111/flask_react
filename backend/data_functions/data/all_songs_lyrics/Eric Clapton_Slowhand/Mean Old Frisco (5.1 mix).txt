Mean Old Frisco (5.1 mix) LyricsWell that mean old dirty Frisco and that low down Santa Fe
Mean old Frisco and that low down Santa Fe
You know they take my girl away, Lord, and blow back out on me
Well my mama, she done told me, and my papa told me too
Mama told me and my papa told me too
A woman that gets in your face, Lord she ain't no friend for you
Well I'm goin' away now baby, and I won't be back until fall
Goin' away, baby. Lord, I won't be back till fall
If I don't come back by then, Lord, I won't be back at all
Well that mean old dirty Frisco and that low down Santa Fe
Mean old Frisco and that low down Santa Fe
Gonna take my gal away, Lord, and blow back out on meEmbed
