Differently LyricsWish you told me by and by that my life would come to this
That I'd have to find a way to let things go
That my friends would turn to foes
And my love could come to blows
Then I would have done some things differently
Differently, I would ask you out every night
Differently, and I would make you feel so good
Differently, and appreciate the things that you bring to me, babe
Differently, oh yes I would
Yeah, I know you tried and tried but your signal I just missed
When you said my little girl would soon be gone
Yes I didn't hear you then and it might be too late now
That's another thing I'd do differently
Differently, like trying to make you feel loved every day
Differently, and saying little things to let you know how I feel
Differently, yes I can hear your young voice calling me, babe
Differently, oh yes I can
When I'm away, I call you up
And you don't seem to miss me as much
But I know our love
Is still there in your heart, just differently
Differently, yes, I can hear your young voice calling me, babe
Differently, oh yes I can
Differently, I'd appreciate the things that you bring to me babe, yes I would
Differently, oh come on back to me babe, bring your love back to me
Differently, oh yeah I need your love, I need your love
Differently, yes I can tell you babe, I need your love
Differently, today is a brand new day, yes it is
Differently, got to get your love back, babe, come on now bring it back to me
Differently, turn it around babe, turn it around and bring it back
Differently, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, got to get your love back, come on babe
Differently, yeah I can hear your young voice calling me babe
Differently, come on back to me, come on back, yeah yeah, turn it around
Differently, oh yes I can, yes I can
