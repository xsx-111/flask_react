Are You Passionate? Lyrics
Are you passionate?
Are you living like you talk?
Are you dreaming now
That you're going to the top?
Are you negative
In a world that never stops

Turning on you?
Turning on me?
Turning on you?

Are you loving it?
Can you ever get enough of it?
Is it everything?
A love that never stops

Coming to you?
Coming to me?
Coming to you?

Once I was a soldier, I was fighting in the sky
And the gunfire kept coming back on me
So I dove into the darkness and I let my missiles fly
And they might be the ones that kept you free
Once I was a prisoner, I was riding in a truck
Cleaned up for public display
I looked at those around me and when they looked at me
I let them see my soul that day
Are you scared of it, do you wish that it would stop?
Does it bother you when you hear your spirit talk?
Well I'm right with you
Yes I'm right with you

It's working on me
It's working on you
It's working on meEmbed
