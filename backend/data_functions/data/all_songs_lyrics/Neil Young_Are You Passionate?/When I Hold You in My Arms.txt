When I Hold You in My Arms Lyrics
When I hold you in my arms
It's a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out there
All those people with their faces
Walking up the street
They don't have to say a thing
Just look around and you see

New buildings going up
Old buildings coming down
New signs going up
Old signs coming down
You got to hold onto something in this life

Well the older generation
They got something to say
But they better say it fast
Or get out of the way
All those gangsters with their crimes
They make it look so good
We've been blowing up the planet
Just like the old neighbourhood

If I only had a heart
It would beat all night for you
If I only had a heart
I would cry the whole day through
When I hold you in my arms
It's like a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out there

Old heart's going up
Old heart's coming down
My feelings going up
My feelings coming down
You got to hold onto someone in this life

When I hold you in my arms
It's a breath of fresh air
When I hold you in my arms
I forget what's out thereEmbed
