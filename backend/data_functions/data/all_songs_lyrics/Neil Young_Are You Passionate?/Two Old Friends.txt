Two Old Friends Lyrics
Preacher went up to the Golden Gate
And met God there
With the glow of love in his flowing hair
I'm dreaming of a time when love and music
Is everywhere
Can you see that time coming?
No my son that time has gone
There's things to do
The world has changed since I first met you
Back when The Band played Rock of Ages
In their prime
And the old juke joint was rocking

Oh Lord there's so much hate
In a world where we're from another place
Show me how to be like you
See no evil, hear no evil
Feel no evil in my heart

In my heart, in my aching heart
In my heart, in my heart
In my old black heart
In my heart, in my heart
In my beating heart
Sky had turned a lot of shades of gray
As they walked on
And a gentle rain fell down on them
They found faith in the way things are and
The way things change
And they said goodbye like two old friends
Take me up to the mountains high
Or a building top where the spirits fly
Show me how to be like you
See no evil, feel no evil
Fear no evil in my heart
