Mr. Disappointment Lyrics
Where did all the feelings go, what about that happy glow?
Was that so long ago when we were first in love?
I didn't feel the change, everything was still the same
And when that moment came, I didn't know
I miss the feeling, I miss the light
But I got faith in something, I'll never give up the fight
Why's it so heavy, this love of mine?
I lost the feeling, I lost the time

I'd like to shake your hand
Disappointment
Looks like you win again
But this time might be the last

Let's say I got a habit, let's say it's hard to break
Let's say we got to do something before it's just too late
I want to get you back, I don't know how to do that
I miss you loving me the way you used to
I'm taking the blame myself for living my life in a shell
And now I'm breaking out, but will you still be there?
Let's say that love is blind, let's say that time is kind
Let's say that it's not over until it's over

I'm saving the best for last, let's leave this all in the past
The beauty of loving you is what we've both been through
So now it's up to me to set your spirit free
So you can swing again on our gate
