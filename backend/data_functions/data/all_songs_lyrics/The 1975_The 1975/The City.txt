The City Lyrics
Don't call it a fight when you know it's a war
With nothing but your t-shirt on
And go sit on the bed because you know that you want to
You've got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong

And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
Go lie on the floor if you want
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was "They're too strong, too strong"
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, counting cards was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got good with his fours and his twos
Community service was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes
Oh, and she said "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there, you said you felt snide
You hope that, that the boy will be alright

Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

Yeah, well, she said "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there, you said that you felt snide
You hope that, that the boy will be alright

Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is65Embed
