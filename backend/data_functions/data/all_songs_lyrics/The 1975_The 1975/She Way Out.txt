She Way Out Lyrics
With a face from a movie scene
Or magazine, know what I mean?
She's definitely got the style on you
She's definitely got the style on you

She's got two-tone everything
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Moving but she just can't move

'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out

She said "It's not about your body
It's just social implications are brought upon by this party that we're sitting in
And I'd like to say you've changed but you're always the same
I've got a feeling that the marijuana's rotting your brain"
She's got two-tone everything, way too intelligent
Moving but she just can't move
She's got two phones, everything
Boyfriend, telling him "Find me 'cause I'll never find you" (Find you)

'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out (Hey)
'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out

The tension's overflowing with every Benson she's throwing
On the floor and in my mouth
She said "I'd love you to stay but that's simply insane
I've got a feeling that my friends are gonna kick in your brain"
Because...
'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out
'Cause she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
Oh, because she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out

Because she way out
Dancing like she way out
Because she way out
I'm telling you, she way out
Because she way out
Never seen her dance moves
Dancing like she way out
Because she way out
Never seen her talk
But I'm telling you, she way out43Embed
