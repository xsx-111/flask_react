Is There Somebody Who Can Watch You LyricsOh, I preferred it before
We should ring Dad more
Lost our house
Hold me close
I stopped by, just to wash my clothes
I know it's me that's supposed to love you
And when I'm home, you know I got you
Is there somebody who can watch you?
I know it's me that's supposed to love you
And when I'm home, you know I got you
Is there somebody who can love you?
Love, you
Is there somebody who can watch you?
Is there somebody who can watch you?30Embed
