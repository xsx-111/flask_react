Pressure Lyrics

You've seen so many faces that I never seen before
I left an unrewarding message telling you to come on
Overdramatic, automatically assume I'll stay the same

There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure)
Oh, my broken veins say

Well, I stay tuned and listen to the news
And try to fall asleep at night
Because I'm living in a house with just three walls
So I'm always getting recognised

There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure)
Oh, my broken veins say
Change in pressure
Change in pressure
Change in pressure
Change in pressure

There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
(Change in pressure)
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
We'll bleed the same way
(Change in pressure)

Oh, my broken veins say60Embed
