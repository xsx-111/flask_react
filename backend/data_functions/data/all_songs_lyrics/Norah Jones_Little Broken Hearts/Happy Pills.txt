Happy Pills Lyrics
Tryna pick up the pace
Tryna make it so I never see your face again
Time to throw this away
Wanna make sure that you never waste my time again

How does it feel
Oh, how does it feel to be you right now, dear?
You broke this apart
So pick up your piece and go away from here

Please just let me go now
Please just let me go
Would you please just let me go now?
Please just let me go

Out, I've gotta get you out
I've gotta get you out
I've gotta get you out of my head, get out
I've gotta get you out
I've gotta get you out
I've gotta get you out of my head, get out
Never said we'd be friends
Tryna keep myself away from you
'Cause you're bad, bad news
With you gone, I'm alive
Makes me feel like I took happy pills
And time stands still

How does it feel?
Oh, how does it feel to be the one shut out?
You broke all the rules
I won't be a fool for you no more, my dear

Please just let me go now
Please just let me go
Would you please just let me go now?
Please just let me go

Out, I've gotta get you out
I've gotta get you out
I've gotta get you out of my head, get out
I've gotta get you out
I've gotta get you out
I've gotta get you out of my head, get out
Please just let me go now
Please just let me go
Please just let me go now
Please just
Please just get me go now
Please just let me go
Please just let me go now
Please justEmbed
