After the Fall Lyrics
I never told you about the summer
Every day was changing
Only photographs
But life goes on
In your mind so warm

Out on my own now
And I like the way it feels
You couldn't come through
And I'm too far gone

After the fall
Do you still want it all?

You never told me about the winter
Every day was changing
But I remember
But life went on
In my mind so cold

Out on your own now
Do you like the way it feels?
Didn't I come through?
You were too far gone
After the fall
I still want it allEmbed
