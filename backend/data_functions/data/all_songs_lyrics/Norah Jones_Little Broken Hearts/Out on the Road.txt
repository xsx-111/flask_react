Out on the Road LyricsI never wanted to be taken
But now I'm feeling so left out
So I don't care where I go
I'm leaving
Yeah, I'm leaving
Got about a half a tank left
That could do but only if I'm lucky
But either way
I'm leaving
Oh, I'm leaving
On my way to paradise
A little voice says, 'Don't think twice'
And 'don't look back if you want things to change'
Ah, ah
I guess I'll have to love you from afar, ah
It's okay, 'cause all I need's my car
Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road I go
Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road
Takes about a week to get there
Maybe two if I stop to sleep it off here
But I can't sleep
So I'm leaving
Yeah, I'm leaving
Keep on driving through the night
To find myself a slice of light
To show me that I'm heading the right way
And ah, ah
I guess you'll have to love me from afar, ah
It's okay, cause all I need's this car
Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road I go
Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road I go
Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the roadEmbed
