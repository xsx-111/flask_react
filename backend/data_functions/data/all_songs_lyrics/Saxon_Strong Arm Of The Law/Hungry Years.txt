Hungry Years LyricsThey came down from the north
To the plough they were forged
On the traces of a man who'd been before
Right up from the street
Came the ranks of unemployed
Then everything became the hungry years
They searched the hungry years
For the triumphs by the fears
There's a chance they had to take
They were waiting for a break
They searched the hungry years
For the triumphs by the fears
Some make it to the stars
Playing rock and roll guitars
Playing rock and roll guitars
They read under the lights
To the jews and to the whites
The systems gonna change and understand them
The business world is deep
For a percentage of the heat
There was magic in the eyes
They couldn't see the lies
They watched it slowly die
They searched the hungry years
For the triumphs by the fears
There's a chance they had to take
They were waiting for a break
They searched the hungry years
For the triumphs by the fears
Some make it to the stars
Playing rock and roll guitars
Playing rock and roll guitars
Some take the fame
And some take the blame
Maybe they will and maybe they won't
Tonight...
They read under the lights
To the jews and to the whites
The systems gonna change and understand them
The business world is deep
For a percentage of the heat
There was magic in the eyes
They couldn't see the lies
They watched it slowly die
They searched the hungry years
For the triumphs by the fears
There's a chance they had to take
They were waiting for a break
They searched the hungry years
For the triumphs by the fears
Some make it to the stars
Playing rock and roll guitars
Playing rock and roll guitarsEmbed
