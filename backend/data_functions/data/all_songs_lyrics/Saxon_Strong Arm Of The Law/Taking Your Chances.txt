Taking Your Chances Lyrics
I know that it's cold well don't stand outside my door
I told you before I don't want you anymore
Changed all the locks and took away your key
I don't care where you go but just stay away from me

I can't stand it
I don't need it
I don't want you
I can't trust you

Taking your chances
In the world outside
Taking your chances
In the world outside

I gave all I had but you still come back for more
It's the end of the line for me and that's for sure
Well I know that you're proud and you love me to the bone
When it's better for you to go you don't stay home

I can't stand it
I don't need it
I don't want you
I can't trust you
Taking your chances
In the world outside
Taking your chances
In the world outside

I know that it's cold well don't stand outside my door
I told you before I don't want you anymore
It's the end of the line for me and that's for sure
I don't care where you go but just keep away from here

I can't stand it
I don't need it
I don't want you
I can't trust you

Taking your chances
In the world outside
Taking your chances
In the world outside
Taking your
