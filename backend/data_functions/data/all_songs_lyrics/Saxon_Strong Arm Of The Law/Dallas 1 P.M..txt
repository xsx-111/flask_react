Dallas 1 P.M. LyricsDown on main street the scene was set
They check out the fuel turn the radio on
Open the gates, assemble the gun
Wait at the red, for the president's run
The world was shocked that fateful day
A young man's lot was blown away, away
Dallas 1 p.m., 1 p.m
Right and left in the back of the head
Screaming confusion, shots rip the air
Cadillac racing, cops on the run
They couldn't believe the president's hit
The shooting stunned as I seemed to run
Is he dead, no-one will say
Around the world the news was flashed
We sat and watched your tragic history
The world was shocked that fateful day
A young man's lot was blown away, away
Dallas 1 p.m., 1 p.m
The world was shocked
In Dallas 1 p.m
We sat and watched
Tragic history
The world was shocked
In Dallas 1 p.mEmbed
