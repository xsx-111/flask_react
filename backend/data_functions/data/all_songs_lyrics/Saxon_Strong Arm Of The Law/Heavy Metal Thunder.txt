Heavy Metal Thunder Lyrics
If you're taking a bite at the speed of light
You're shaking your heads to the band
There's a dare on your horse, but you're not on the force
We're taking this think to the ground
In the heat of the night when you're fists are alight
Touching temples of steel
And your body's on fire about to expire
But you don't feel the pressure of pain

Pull your head back, hold your hands high, shake your body
And it's too loud and you put them up
Fill your heads with heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunder

On the wings of an eagle you're hoping to fly
Holding your hands to the sky
On a blue sea of venom you turn to the band with
Your banners and skirts blowing high
If you think something more you'll come down to the front
Then you'll do as they say
Where an army of cars are surrounded by lights
Turning my face to the ground
Pull your head back, hold your hands high, shake your body
And it's too loud and you put them up
Fill your heads with heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunder


Pull your head back, hold your hands high, shake your body
And it's too loud and you put them up
Fill your heads with heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunder

If you're taking a bite at the speed of light
You're shaking your heads to the band
There's a dare on your horse, but you're not on the force
We're taking this think to the ground
In the heat of the night when you're fists are alight
Touching temples of steel and your body's on fire
About to expire
But you don't feel the pressure of pain

Pull your head back, hold your hands high, shake your body
And it's too loud and you put them up
Fill your heads with heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunder
On the wings of an eagle you're hoping to fly
Holding your hands to the sky
On a blue sea of venom you turn to the band with
Your banners and skirts blowing high
If you think something more you'll come down to the front
Then you'll do as they say
Where an army of cars are surrounded by lights
Nobody stands in our way

Pull your head back, hold your hands high, shake your body
And it's too loud and you put them up
Fill your heads with heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunder
Heavy metal thunderEmbed
