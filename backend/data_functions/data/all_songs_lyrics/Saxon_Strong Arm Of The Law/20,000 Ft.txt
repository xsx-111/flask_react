20,000 Ft Lyrics
If there's one thing I love
It's flying there above
Breaking through the barrier of sound
It's just like making love
Sittin' there above
Riding in my bird of silver steel

Time after time
Ten miles high
I'm living my fantasies
At twenty thousand feet

It's the rushing of my blood
That makes me feel so good
I can see the world below just shooting by
Twice the speed of sound
That's how I like to ride
My chariot of steel across the sky

Time after time
Ten miles high
I'm living my fantasies
At twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet
If it's faster than light
Sharper than steel
I'll race across the ceiling of the world
Just like a gun
Aiming at the sun
Riding in my bird of silver steel

Time after time
Ten miles high
Living my fantasies
At twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet

I'm floating in space
My troubles seems to disappear
Then I awake
Got to get my head back in place

Twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feet
Twenty thousand feetEmbed
