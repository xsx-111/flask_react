Automatically Yours LyricsI don't wanna go halfway across the globe
To find things that I don't wanna know
I can seek for a long time through all that stuff
To find something that I don't really care about
There's not much about
But when you smile
You make the world seem a home
And when you smile
How can a smile just say it all?
I don't wanna be what I cannot see
And it feels alright; you'll in my heart remain
I walked through the door and I picked up my soul
But the keys were stolen and the door won't open
No, it's just my luck
But when you smile
You make the world seem a home
And when you smile
I guess I'll just stay at home
I can't describe this feeling
It hammers my brain
I can't deny this feeling
It drives me insane
Always the same
But when you smile
You make the world seem a home
And when you smile
Automatically yours
Yeah I'm yoursEmbed
