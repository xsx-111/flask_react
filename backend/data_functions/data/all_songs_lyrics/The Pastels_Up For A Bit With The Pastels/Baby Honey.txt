Baby Honey LyricsIf I wish upon a star
Take you just the way you are
And If I do something for you
It's everything I do for you
If you're feeling down and out
Oh I want to make it right
If the love you feel is true
Please let me share it with you
If you wish upon a star
Take me just the way I am
And If I do something for you
It's everything I do for you
There is magic in her fingertips
There is magic in the lips I kiss
There is magic in her beautiful eyes
Justify the tears I've criedEmbed
