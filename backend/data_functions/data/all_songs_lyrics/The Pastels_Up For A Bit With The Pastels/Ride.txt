Ride LyricsI was born in the middle of nowhere
And since that day I've been suffocating
Tell myself this dump trod on me
Anticipating and waiting and waiting
But oh I feel so lonely
Gonna make my way down to the bus station
Wanna ride
And everything's in site
Just wanna ride
Wanna ride
I tell myself this dump's trod on me
But still I keep suffocating
It's a desperate situation
I've wanted and wanted and wanted
Hoping and praying
But still I feel so lonely
Gonna make my way down to the bus station
Wanna ride
And everything's in site
Just wanna ride
Wanna ride
I'm choking
My humor is gone
This trouble
Goes on forever
Sitting here
Desperate Situation
Wait and smile
Wind and snow
Not got much time
They don't like me
Don't like them either
Desperate situationEmbed
