Address Book LyricsYou know I don't mean half the things I say
'Cos if I did I wouldn't say them
So please don't take me too literally
'Cos I'm afraid I'll only get encouraged
But then you look at me
And I know I've let myself down
And I'll go down
To the cold, hard ground
Where there's no one else around
When I'm down
There are no easy words
To explain the way our lives charade
And though we seem to be at each other's throats
That isn't really the case
We're just beginning to find out
What everything's about
But you're only half way there
Which is more or less the same as me
But in a different world
One of these days I'm gonna look at my address book
And you won't be there
You know I don't mean half the things I say
So just ignore the half that you don't like
You know I don't mean half the things I say
So just ignore the half that you don't likeEmbed
