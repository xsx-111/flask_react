Crawl Babies LyricsShe comes walking down the road
And I know that dogs won't bark
She comes walking up the stairs
She's tap-tap-tapping on my door
And she'll make those tears to know that it's a must
But I go blind and my mouth fills up with dust
Says she's open like a book
She's got everything I need
Even wants to take the time
To teach me how to read
But the ceiling moves on down towards the floor
And soon there's only room enough for us to crawl
I wanna build her up
Up as tall as a church
Just to watch her
Just to watch her falling down
I can't see her again
I just can't see her again
I've got to see her again
I've got to see her again
She comes walking down the road
With a kaftan in her hands
She comes walking up the stairs
She's tap-tap-tapping on my door
And she'll make those tears to know that it's a must
But I go blind and my bones start to rust
I wanna build her up
Up as tall as a church
Just to watch her
Just to watch her falling down
I can't see her again
I just can't see her again
I've got to see her again
I've got to see her againEmbed
