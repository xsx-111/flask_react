If I Could Tell You LyricsTime says nothing but I told you so
And laughs at all the foolish things we say
If I could tell you I would let you know
I'd let you know
It never says that you could stay awhile
In a place where you feel at home
And when it comes to moving on again
You just smile
'Til each ex-lover forgets your face
And the end has not justified the means
Nothing unexpected as you know
Just not so soon
And when it's time for us to go
Who remembers what we lost on the way?
Our intentions left forever more
If I could tell you I would let you know
I'd let you knowEmbed
