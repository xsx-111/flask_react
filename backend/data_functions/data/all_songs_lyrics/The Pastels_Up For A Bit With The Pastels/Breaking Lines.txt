Breaking Lines Lyrics
Your feelings touch me so
I'm holding on cause I can’t let go
I watch the trains go down the tracks
I've got nowhere to go

Breaking lines and breaking time
Breaking down each other's minds
Breaking up and breaking down
And breaking back inside again

I’ve cut you down but I cut myself
I wish I was someone else
I watch the trains go down the track
I wish I was somewhere else

Breaking lines and breaking time
Breaking down each other's minds
Breaking up and breaking down
And breaking back inside again

I want some help but there's no one there
That's the way it goes today
I watch the trains go down the tracks
Then turned around and walked away
Breaking lines and breaking time
Breaking down each other's minds
Breaking up and breaking down
And breaking back inside again

Sometimes it comes, sometimes, sometimes I can't explain
Sometimes I connect and sometimes I miss
Sometimes it comes, sometimes, I can't explain
Sometimes it all comes down to thisEmbed
