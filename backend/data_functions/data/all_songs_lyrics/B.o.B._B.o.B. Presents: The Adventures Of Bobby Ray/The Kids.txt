The Kids Lyrics
Drug boys' steady shooting
The streets don’t give a damn
They’re filled with such pollution
The kids don’t stand a chance

We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance

Well, since I was planted at birth
I abandoned my own planet and I landed on earth
As a kid I never understood what I observed, and
Some of it was strange, but most of it disturbed me
Always in detention for the lack of my attention
You can call it deficit, really I just didn’t listen
And I was always missing, the teacher’s like "where is Bobby Simmons?"
But trying to get a record deal is all I can remember
It’s funny cause looking back to the past that I had
All my days in the streets trying to prove that I was bad
I still elevated to the level that I’m at
Still elevated to the level that I’m at
We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance

Sometimes it’s hard to grow
While living in fear of the unknown
How can he ever give love
When no love is in his heart
A child can barely sleep at night
Too worried about tomorrow
And what it behold, he drowned himself
Deep down in his sorrows
Will you run or will you share your life?
Tell the stories, live and try
See it when we’re given hope
That we know that we can grow

We’re trapped inside the matrix
Forced to play our hands
We’re filled with so much hatred
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance
I said the kids don’t, the kids don’t stand
The kids don’t stand a chance2Embed
