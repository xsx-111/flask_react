Ghost in the Machine Lyrics
Tell me, where am I supposed to go?
And who am I supposed to believe?
If only you knew what I knew
Then you could see just what I see
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

So I grab my bags and go
As far away as I can go
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
And I try to hide
But I just can't hide no more
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost

You say I look fine
If only you knew what was on my mind
You'd see a whole different side
I couldn't show you even if I tried
I must have got lost in time
When I found out I was solely free to be
Wherever I want to be
Some say I'm out of sight
How ironic that we're all so blind
If you could open up your eyes
You could see what I couldn't describe
And then, you'd see the signs
And then your soul would be set free
And then you'd be released
So I grab my bags and go
As far away as I can go
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
And I try to hide
But I just can't hide no more
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost

Tell me, where am I supposed to go?
And who am I supposed to believe?
If only you knew what I knew
Then you could see, hey, yeah

So I grab my bags and go (I go)
As far away as I can go (which way to go?)
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
(It ain't what I used to know)
And I try to hide (Hide, hide)
But I just can't hide no more (No, no, no)
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost
(There's nothin' worse)

And I'm terrified (Terrified)
Like I've seen a UFO (A UFO)
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
(It ain't what I used to know)
And I try to hide (I try to hide)
But I just can't hide no more (No, no, no)
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost
I go
A UFO
And I'm so tired, tired of hiding
I've been running, I've been trying
To get away
To get away

So I grab my bags and go
As far away as I can go
'Cause everything ain't what I used to know
And I try to hide
But I just can't hide no more
There's nothin' worse than feelin' like a ghost10Embed
