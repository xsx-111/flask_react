Fame Lyrics
Cheah, don't you cry, no
Pretty darling I said now, cry no
Pretty darling I said now, cry no
Pretty darling I said now
Little, baby, I don't, I don't, I don't, don't you cry

Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?
Everywhere ya go, people know what ya name is
Everyone ya know, tryin' to tell ya, ya changin'
They wanna taste that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame)

Famous, everybody wanna be famous
Most people wanna just taste it
Other people try to just sneak in the VIP and chill with the big faces
That don't really see them changes, when the fame hit
When I'm up on the stage they sing it but soon as I step off they hate it
And I'm sayin', I really ain't with that complainin'
Just look at the picture I'm paintin'
Yeah I pay my rent, vacation then
Take trips all around the equator then
Come back to the A, hit the stage again
Then I go up in the booth, where they cage me in
Feel regular but then I go insane again (fame)
If you witness the condition that my brain is in
You will see I'm in Hell where Satan is
Hardest thing to do is to maintain a friend
'Cause everybody tryin' to get paid from it
But fuck it, this the entertainment bus', so let the games begin
I mean let the flames begin
But hey, I'm just trained at this
Lie to everybody, then get paid from it, I'm famous
Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?
Everywhere ya go, people know what ya name is
Everyone ya know, tryin' to tell ya, ya changin'
They wanna taste that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame)

Popular, everybody wanna be popular
Little kids just be watchin' us, through binoculars
And then they go to school and copy us
But hey, I'm not knockin' ya but how can y'all not see it's obvious
'Cause, cops just be plottin' on us and paparazzi be spottin' us
Plus, everybody just wanna be, on MTV or BET
Or, maybe season MVP or maybe even just Prom King or Queen
But, everybody can't be a G-O to the D
And everybody can't be O to the B
But I don't know, maybe this is just how we supposed to be
But this is what'll happen to y'all
You can go crazy and beat up trucks
The tabloids sayin' that ya hooked on drugs
You cuttin' up your face, then sew it back up
But look, it's plain to see, ain't nothin' in this game gonna be changin' me
I'm a always be, O to the B, me, me, I'm famous

Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?
Everywhere ya go, people know what ya name is
Everyone ya know, tryin' to tell ya, ya changin'
They wanna taste that (fame, fame, fame, fame, fame)
Everywhere ya go they just wanna be stars
Everyone ya know wanna drive fancy cars
Everyone ya know wants you to buy out the bar
They wanna taste that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame), that (fame)
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go now
Everywhere we go, everywhere we go now

Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?
Everywhere ya go, people know what ya name is
Everyone ya know, tryin' to tell ya, ya changin'
They wanna taste that (fame, fame, fame, fame, fame)
Hey, hey, do you wanna be famous?
Everywhere ya go, people know what ya name is
Everyone ya know, tryin' to tell ya, ya changin'
They wanna taste that (fame, fame, fame, fame, fame)
