I See Ya Lyrics
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah) (I see ya)
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah) (I see ya)
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah)(I see ya)
I see ya (I see ya)

Yeah
It's B-O-B-O
No I don't need no lingo
Cause I'm on this mic I chicka-pow-pow chicka-pow-pow to the beat though
Yeah shoot it up like a free throw
Where?
From the west to the east coast
Like Ne-yo in a pea coat
Motherfuck like Danny DeVito
Lemme get a second just to reload
Cause I'm cool in the pocket like Tebow (yes!)
Cooler than the cheetahs on the Cheetos
Don't think that I lost my touch by much
I just been chillin' at the bank like aye!
Show me to the safe
Had to get my papers straight
Now I'm okay
Now it's back to the lab, yes back to the basics
So don't think that I ain't sick
That I'm in places you can't get
When you're inside of the matrix
High is my vibration
High like levitation
High like every race in
In this generation
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah) (I see ya)
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah) (I see ya)
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah)(I see ya)
I see ya (I see ya)
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah) (I see ya)
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah) (I see ya)
I see ya (yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah)(I see ya)
I see ya (I see ya)

Hold up, hold up, hold up
It's Bobby Ray
I mean my name B.o.B
When I'm on this mic I melt that fire
That's my job
I am a bomb
Try if ya want
Tick me off and I'm likely to (boom)
So I wouldn't do that
I'd would sit back
Unless you got tricks, inside of a hat
Then I would eat
Still wouldn't defeat
The fact that I'm insane, yes literally
I spit on the beat
I shit on the beat
Then I wipe with an MC
Throw them in the trash
B.o.B stop
Wait a minute maybe just switch up the flow
I was on a whole different level but now I'm ready to level
With a hellfire venomous flow
Here's the thing
Clearly
I'm in a place you can't really be
I'm in a space
Called a zone
And when you inside you just kinda know
And you don't stop
Cause you just float
And if you will then I know you don't
And if you not then you go for broke
But this a jungle let me go for those
I see ya
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya, yeahyeah, yeah, yeahyeahyeah, yeah (I see ya)
I see ya (I see ya)

I spit on the beat, I shit on the beat, then I wipe with an MC1Embed
