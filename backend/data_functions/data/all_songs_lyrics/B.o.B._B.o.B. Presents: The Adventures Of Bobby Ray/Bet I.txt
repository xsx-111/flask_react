Bet I Lyrics
Put me on anything, still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust, I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I, I bet I bust, I bet I bust
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust

Yo, bud boys, bet I bust, that's just what I does, yes
Put me anywhere on the map with a backpack strapped, still I bet I bust
Bet I flow, bet I rip this beat, bet I feel that soul
Bet I go, bet I bench these niggas like Ray, sit down bro
Bet I know everything about this game, bet I know my role
But they know when I come to the court this is my sport, B-dot-o-B
So bet I'm gone, bet I'm on a brand new plane
Bet I'm in a whole different zone
I ain't really from this place, so I'm up all night long
Really I'm in outer space, really ain't got no home
Really I'm a saint, bet I'm blown, bet I'm thrown
Up to the sky, over the ocean
So I'll fly, wherever I'm goin'
When I'm by, bet I'm focused
If it's fire, you can bet I roll it
Matter of fact, you can bet I bust
Put me on anything, still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust, I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I, I bet I bust, I bet I bust
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust

Yeah, hey, gather round, front and center, the King finna enter
The room when the boom hit the booth, I deliver
The hottest, you probably too small to acknowledge, you
Impossible to copy like what everybody try to do
We cool as some dudes on them waves out in Malibu
I'm fallin' hard baseline, ball through the alley-oop (bang!)
Comin' through this thing like James
In the air, off the rim I hang
Nigga, this king
Pretend you forgot my name if you wanna
I'ma come hard like a boner, don't I
Make a nigga wanna rebound, turned up all the way
We amped, two or three tramp
With 'em in the mill, same Bentley
Niggas said they do it like us, you shittin' me?
'96, '97 in Atlanta
Didn't we have more blocks than Mutombo, Dikembe?
For those who can't hold water, need new kidneys
Put 'em down under Australia, Sydney
And I'm still representin'
For the niggas on the prison yard, tuned in, listenin'
I'm back to doin' big things
A sucker lookin' for me, start in your bitch's dreams
Or twenty feet tall standin' on the big screen
Get dough, big green, my flow sickenin'; it's the King, nigga
Put me on anything, still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust, I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I, I bet I bust, I bet I bust
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust

Yeah, back with a cup of that liquor, nigga
Y'all don't really know Tre
Really know me, really know the streets, no
Y'all niggas really ain't G, really ain't hard
Never really served no hard, y'all be playin' that role
Talkin' that pimp shit, never really pimp shit, nah
Y'all be savin' them hoes, but I don't and I won't
I'll get a bitch anytime I want
I'm that guy, spit that fire, shake the ground every time I stomp
Beat in the trunk, cup in the air
You can talk shit but I really don't care
Man I'm in the Cadillac
Gun go rat-tat-a-tat-tat but a nigga ain't scared
From that Red Clay, east of the A
Young niggas get locked up everyday
Cops ain't shit, so I drop that shit
Have it drop on 'em, make it through the day
Grindin' for my pay, it's that nigga Tre
Bustin' like a pistol best believe it when I say that I bust
Put me on anything, still I bet I bust
Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust
This is what I does so, please don't gas me up
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust
I bet I bust, I bet I bust
I bet I, I bet I, I bet I bust, I bet I bust
Matter of fact, give me fifteen minutes and a bag of bud
I bet I bust7Embed
