Letters From Vietnam Lyrics
Goodbye my love
The country is in need of me
And I heard there were signs for war
So I'm going overseas
So don't cry my love
The skies above will cry for you
And I'll be safe so hopefully
I'll come back home for you
Yeah, yeah

So please
Tell me it's not true
After all the love I've given
You found someone new
And oh, of all the things I've seen
This has got to be, got to be the greatest tragedy
Oh you, you let it all slip away
But soon you'll find
Soon you'll find (yeah)
What you can't replace

I gave away my love
That I promised you I would keep
A thousand deaths I died that day
When two became one
A greater force pulled you away
So I got on my knees and begged
The silence replaced my tears
So goodbye, my love
August 1, 1965
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
So please
Tell me it's not true
After all the love I've given
You found someone new
And oh, of all the things I've seen
This has got to be, got to be the greatest tragedy
Oh you, you let it all slip away
But soon you'll find
Soon you'll find, yeah
What you can't replace
Yeah

Goodbye my love
As I bid farewell to thee
All is fair in love and war
So I'm going overseas5Embed
