Lovelier Than You Lyrics
Maybe one day we can go
Hand in hand down a golden road
And if I get there before you go
I'll be waiting at the do'
In the future, hopefully
We'll be together, you and me

Don't you worry, baby, please
'Cause honestly

If I could rewind
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
A lovelier design than you

Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you

Maybe one day, girl, I pray
We could float off to space
Hold my hand I'll lead the way
I won't let go or fall astray
Ain't no 'ifs', 'butts' and 'maybes'
You're my baby, my lady
Don't you worry, baby, please
'Cause honestly

If I could rewind
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
A lovelier design than you

I'm dangerously, dangerously, dangerously in love
I love her more than I love myself but still that ain't enough, hmm
If this a dream I don't wanna wake up
We go together like the tub and the shower head above, huh
Not even thousands and thousands of miles
Could amount to my love, I'd have countless sky miles
I'd climb up a mountain, climb right back down
I'd run across the world then jog back around
A noun and a verb is just a sound, and a word is not profound
Enough to show my urge, for her smile
I'd shout on a curb with a loud speaker
Till the entire town heard how I felt, and I'm out

Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Nothing's lovelier than you
Maybe one day we can go
Hand in hand down a golden road
And if I get there before you go
I'll be waiting at the do'
In the future, hopefully
We'll be together, you and me

Don't you worry, baby, please
'Cause honestly

If I could rewind
Both the hands of time
Still I would never find
A lovelier design than you1Embed
