Sober Up (Steve Aoki Remix) Lyrics
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missing me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young

Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up, it made me numb
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel something again
Won't you help me feel something again?

Won't you help me sober up
Sober up
Sober up
Sober up
Sober up
How's it go again?
How's it go again?
"Goodbye, goodbye,"
I said to my bestest buds
We said that we'd keep in touch
And we did our best
All my new friends
We smile at party time
But soon we forget to smile
At anything else

Won't you help me sober up?
Growing up, it made me numb
And I want to feel something again (My favorite color is you)
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel something again (My favorite color is you)
Won't you help me feel something again?

Won't you help me sober up
Sober up
Sober up
Sober up
Sober up
How's it go again?
How's it go again?Embed
