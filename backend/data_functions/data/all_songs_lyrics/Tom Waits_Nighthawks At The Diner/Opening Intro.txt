Opening Intro LyricsWell, an inebriated good evening to you all. Welcome to Rapheal's Silver Cloud Lounge. Slip me a little crimson, Jimson. Give me the low down, Brown. What's the scoop, Betty Boop? I'm on my way into town

Yeah, I wanna pull on your coat about something here tonight. Yeah, a little news I'd like to throw your direction. See I...I used to know a girl, yeah and it was a hubba hubba and ding dang ding.
