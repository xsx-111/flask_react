Spare Parts 2 and Closing LyricsI want to thank you all very much for coming this evening
It really made my night
It would have been real strange here if nobody would have showed up
I'd like to introduce my group this evening and it's been a real preasure
A preasure and a plivilege to work with these gentlemen
I'd like to introduce
Please give a warm round of applause for Michael Melvoin on piano!
On saxophone, Pete Christlieb
On bass, Jim Hughart
And on drums, Bill Goodwin
Yeah
They all come from good families
But over the years they just kind of individually developed some ways about 'em that just aren't right
You know, I was real pleased
I noticed everybody coming in this evening
You're all decked out in full regalia and everything
And I appreciate you getting dressed up for an affair such as this You know, I think it's something that I've always tried to be as concerned about as possible
And somebody said to me one day
'Christ, Waits! You look so goddamned raggedy
Why don't you get yourself something to wear, you know?'
I said, 'Yeah well, not a bad idea'
Maybe a serious seersucker Saturday evening cranberry accoutrement ensemble would be nice
So I went down to Zeider & Zeider
And I said, 'I want something sharp!'
I said, 'I'm kind of in the market, in the neighborhood of something
Like maybe some green gabardines with bonnaroo britches
And a leviticously deuteronomous sort of catastrophic lunchbox Stetson, you know
I'd like to get some danger high-voltage slacks
With high-top, mid-noon, brushed suede penny loafers
So I can be passing out wolf tickets regardless of where I go.'
Walk into the Twenty-Grand Club
And the Soul & Inspirations are playing
Yeah, and you're cutting a rug and pulling on a coat and emoting
Band is kicking into some long version of 'Harlem Nocturne' or something
You get designs on a girl in the corner
You say, 'Say baby... live around here?'
Yeah... I think I'm gonna plant you now and I'm gonna dig you later
Make like a bakery truck and haul buns
Make like a hockey player and get the puck out of here
I gotta go see a man about a dog
I'll see you later
Thank you very much for coming this eveningEmbed
