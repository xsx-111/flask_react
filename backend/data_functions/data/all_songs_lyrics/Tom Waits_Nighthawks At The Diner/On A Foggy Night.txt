On A Foggy Night LyricsIt was all upon a foggy night
An abandoned road in a twilight mirror mirage
With no indication of any kind of service station
Or an all-night garage
I was misinformed, I was misdirected
Cause the interchange never intersected
Leaving me marooned beneath a bloodshot moon
All upon a foggy night, a foggy night
All upon a foggy night
It was kind of an abandoned road in a blurred brocade collage
Is that a road motel? I can't really tell
You gotta tell me, is that a vacancy lodge?
There's no consolation, what kind of situation?
To be aimlessly askew amidst a powder blue
No tell-tale light clue
Spun just like a spell you spin
This precarious pandemonium
Roslyn, I'm stranded
All upon a foggy night
Like a sweepstakes ticket for a Broadway arcade
Heads you win, tails I lose
I'm rambling, I'm gambling
All upon a foggy night
Foggy night
Foggy night
Foggy night
You got the vice grips on my personality
It's all upon a foggy night
All upon a foggy night
All upon a foggy night
On a foggy night
All upon a foggy
All upon a foggy nightEmbed
