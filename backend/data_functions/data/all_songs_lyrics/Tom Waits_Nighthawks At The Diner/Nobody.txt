Nobody LyricsNobody, nobody
Will ever love you the way I could love you
'Cause nobody, nobody is that strong
Love is bittersweet
And life's treasures deep
And no one can keep a love that's gone wrong
Nobody, nobody
Will love you the way that I could
'Cause nobody, nobody's that strong
'Cause nobody is that strong
Nobody, nobody
Will ever love you the way I can love you
'Cause nobody, nobody's that strong
You've had many lovers
You'll have many others
But they'll only just break your poor heart in two
Nobody, nobody
Will love you the way that I could
'Cause nobody, nobody's that strong
'Cause nobody is that strongEmbed
