Parachute Woman Lyrics
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
Parachute woman, land on me tonight
I'll break big in New Orleans
And I'll overspill in Carolina

Parachute woman, join me for a ride
Parachute woman, join me for a ride
I'll make my play in Dallas
And get hot again in half the time
Baby

Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Parachute woman, will you blow me out?
Well, my heavy throbber's itching
Just to lay a solid rhythm down
HereEmbed
