Popstar Researching Oblivion LyricsI never knew what you thought was here
Get another fear to add to the list
I've been collecting little lies
Just to put on the special tape
I get them to play the day you die
I'll tell them you were always frightened
Just like anybody else
And you cried inside just like me
You seem to live with fingertips
Wrapped around your face
Does it keep the dark away?
Talk to me and tell me that all of them are wrong
And all my dreams will come in time
Trying, trying to understand it all
To understand it all just makes your head hurt
Trying, trying to understand it all
To understand it all just makes your head hurt
Yes you have all the pieces they said that you had to collect
But what did you expect that all to amount to?
Trying, trying to understand it all
To understand it all just makes your head hurt
Trying, trying to understand it all
To understand it all just makes your head hurtEmbed
