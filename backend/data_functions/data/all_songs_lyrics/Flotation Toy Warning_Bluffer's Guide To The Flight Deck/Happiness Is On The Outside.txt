Happiness Is On The Outside LyricsHello... hello... hello... hello...
Can you tell me
Why you left me
Here all on my own?
Can you hear me?
Do you listen to me?
'Cause I need you
But you once told me
That friends don't need me
They just need someone to phone
When they have nobody
Nobody else to shout at
When they're so very down
I... I...
I have a book in which
That I write everything
And I know where you've been
One day I'll tell them
How I defeated you
And how I took your throne
As the meanest bastard
In all Alberquerque
And how I'm happy alone
Alone... alone... alone...Embed
