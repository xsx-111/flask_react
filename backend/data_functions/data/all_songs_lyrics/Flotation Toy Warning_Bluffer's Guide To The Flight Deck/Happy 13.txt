Happy 13 LyricsIt was sunny on the day the journey began
Seems i was a part of some lack of a plan
Was i early?
'Cause you weren't ready
Looking back now where it all seems bizarre
The boy in the photo on the seat of the car
That's me
At least it was me
Back then
Please leave all shiny objects behind
You won't need them where we're going
Relax, take a deep breath, and concentrate now
We really must be gone
There is a risk in everything we undertake
But now you must trust me more than anyone
'Cause i've seen things
That you could only dream about
I've been to places that you'll never find
And i've had dreams that you couldn't even fit inside your head now
All the places i wish i could find
'Cause i've seen things
That you could only dream about
I've been to places that you'll never find
And i've had dreams that you couldn't even fit inside your head now
All the places i wish i could find
Guess we can't really choose exactly where we land
But how fast you were bound is in your own hands
Are you ready?
Am i too early?
Looking back now where it all seems bizarre
The boy in the photo on the seat of the car
That's me
At least it was me
Back then
Relax, take a deep breath, and concentrate now
We really must be gone
There's a risk in everything we undertake
Now, you must trust me more than anyoneEmbed
