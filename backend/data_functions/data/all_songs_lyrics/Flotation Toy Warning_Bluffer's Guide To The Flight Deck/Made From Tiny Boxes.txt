Made From Tiny Boxes LyricsGood evening, welcome to the party
Please sit wherever you want
I love unicorns
I loved you once
Good evening, welcome to the party
Please sit wherever you want
I was a house once
I moved out, you moved away
Good evening, welcome to the party
Please sit wherever you want
Good evening, welcome to the party
GoodnightEmbed
