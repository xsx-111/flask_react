Fire Engine On Fire Pt.I LyricsIt's not always easy to know when to stop
'Cause the biggest pig of all is love
Be my bad dog if you want
Be my true hog if you want
Absence makes the heart grow stronger that's what they say
But how can I miss you at all if you won't go away?
Be my bad dog if you want
Be my true hog if you want
I lose my train of thought
Please help me now, 'cause I am falling down
You left here without me, now I'm falling down
Save me from myself, 'cause I am falling downEmbed
