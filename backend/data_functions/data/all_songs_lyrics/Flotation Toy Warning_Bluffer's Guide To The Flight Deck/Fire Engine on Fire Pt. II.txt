Fire Engine on Fire Pt. II LyricsI have the tapes
I have the plan of a clockwork man
He was happy to walk
Where I always ran
When I'm orchestrated, automated, decimated, regulated
From three folls' creek
From underground by a despot man and a clown
If you choose to walk instead with a clockwork man
Map of warm roads in his concrete hand
Tell me, does he miss reeling?
Does he miss falling?
Can he take you where the boom bands play?
When you're underground
Can he read the sounds
And chase the Hakken-Kraks away?Embed
