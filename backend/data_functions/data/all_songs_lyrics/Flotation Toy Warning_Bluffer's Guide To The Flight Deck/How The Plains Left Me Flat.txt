How The Plains Left Me Flat LyricsSo sad, have you seen your soul in the Sunday paper?
Trying hard to step aside for death
Service with a smile, the reel to reel rank and file
Looking at your face and I seem misplaces, ah ha ha
Look at me with my face in the middle of the Sunday paper
Laughing on the side, looking on the bright side
Black side, downside, never on the outside
Looking at the ways you choose to keep it like a dream and a house in the middle
Christmas present in the middle of June, well I've been fooled before and so have you, ah ha ha
All the songs will be with you and all the flowers will be with me
But I can't seem to forget you
And all the clowns will be with you and all the children sing with me
(I can hear the rolling seas and I can feel the summer breeze)
But I can't seem to forget you
(But I cannot leave you here, I know you want me to)
Look at me with my face in the middle of the Sunday paper
Christmas present in the middle of June, I've been wrong before but so have you, ah ha ha
Looking at the ways you choose to keep it like a dream and a house in the middle
Christmas present in the middle of June, I've been fooled before but so have you1Embed
