Donald Pleasance LyricsCame to say how you feel today, how you feel inside
You can't tell me that you know how it feels
When you don't seem to feel at all
You came here today to tell me this, you think I'm stupid?
This is the funeral of our love
I came here only to say goodbye
Leonard stop the trains by any certain means
I couldn't bear to board another
She not me was the dealer
With a tiny useless fucking shelter
David pass me the wine, like you I'm "really not fine"
Did I really mean her harm?
I never set foot in the country
Donald tell me why pleasance never gets me anywhere, anymore
Was the lovely man from Mars?
I never liked Venus at all
This brittle house our love has stained
I've left before and I'll leave again
But your little blue moods drag me in
But I know you won't be bringing me down this time
Growing pains and empty days
Records played and certain shades of blue remind me still of you
But I know you won't be bringing me down this time
You can't tell me that you know how it feels
When you don't seem to feel at all
This is the funeral of our love
I came here only to say goodbye
This is the funeral of our love
I came here only to say goodbye
This is the funeral of our love
I came here only to say goodbyeEmbed
