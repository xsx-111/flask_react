Up on High LyricsWith your head full of stars
That crowd all you see
Sing for me
With your mouth full of stones
Grindin' your teeth
Speak for me
In this big empty room
Finally feel free
To sing for me
To sing for me
If the tides should all turn
Push me off to sea
Swim for me
If that lord up on high
Is nearer to me
Pray for me
But in this big empty room
Finally feel free
To sing for me
