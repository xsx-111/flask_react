Golden Mile Lyrics
Denied, a life in retreat
Living on your knees
It's alright, you're still light on your feet
But you can't run from me

Another silent hour, another golden mile
Another silent hour, another golden mile
Another empty heart, another bitter smile
Another silent hour, another golden mile

No fight, there's no crushing defeat
It's a lie run free
Those lies, they're precious to me
Come along, leave me be

For a silent hour, for a golden mile
For a silent hour, for a golden mile
There is bliss in this mess
There is madness all around
For a silent hour, for a golden mile

Say the words, break the spell
Say the words, break the spell
Say the words in your mind
Before you shout out loud2Embed
