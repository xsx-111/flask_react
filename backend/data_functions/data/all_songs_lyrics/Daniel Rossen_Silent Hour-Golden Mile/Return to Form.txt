Return to Form LyricsLooking out on the end
Your failures etched in fallow land
The flames leap the clouds
And draw whispers from the crowd
Return to dark again
Go on put it out
It's time again for your return
Now find the peace you deserve
The stars hang in a shroud
And those whispers turn to shouts
Return to form again
Go on let 'em out
Call him what you want
A coward or a clown
Light up the fire again
And throw him on
Fire (fire)
Fire (fire)
Fire (fire)
Fire (fire)
