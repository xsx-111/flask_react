Fingernails Lyrics
Never reaching what I want to reach
Never being who I want to be
Blaming me when I fall and fail
All my dreams splintering
Under my fingernails
Under my fingernails

I'm empty, lonely, and accused
Accused without a word
My fingernails are chipping down
From clawing in the dirt
I'm so lost, lost and confused
I threw it all away
How can I be beautiful
When I am so afraid

Never reaching what I want to reach
Never being who I want to be
Blaming me when I fall and fail
All my dreams splintering
Under my fingernails
All my dreams out of reach
Under my fingernails
I watched it all slip through my hands
My brokenness revealed
I'm so proud, I'm so proud
I'm crying to be filled
I'm killing, destroying the plague
That's killing me away
I've got to live, I've got to love
Like I am unafraid

Never reaching what I want to reach
Never being who I want to be
Blaming me when I fall and fail
All my dreams splintering
Under my fingernails
Never reaching what I want to reach
Never being who I want to be
Blaming me when I fall and fail
All my dreams splintering
Under my fingernails
All my dreams out of reach
Under my fingernails

I'm wasting, wasting every moment
I want to be tasting
Tasting every moment with you
I'm suffering, I'm bleeding, on my knees
Who's going to save me?
Suffering, bleeding
Save me from this pit of frailty
Never reaching what I want to reach
Never being who I want to be
Blaming me when I fall and fail
All my dreams splintering
Under my fingernails
Never reaching what I want to reach
Never being who I want to be
Blaming me when I fall and fail
All my dreams splintering
Under my fingernails
All my dreams out of reach
Under my fingernails
Never reaching meEmbed
