Savior Lyrics
I am everything you've wanted
I am the one who's haunting you
I am the eyes inside of you
Stare back at you
There's nothing left to lose
There's nothing left to prove
Surrender your love
It's all you can do, yeah

What you got
What you want
What you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's going to crash and break
But I know, yeah, I know
What you got
What you want
What you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's going to crash and break
Your savior

It is time to redefine
Your deophobic mind
Do not hesitate, no escape
From secrets on the inside
There's nothing left to lose
There's nothing left to prove
Surrender your love
It's all you can do, yeah
What you got
What you want
What you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's going to crash and break
But I know, yeah, I know
What you got
What you want
What you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's going to crash and break
Your savior

I am the eyes inside
Staring back at you
I am the eyes inside
Staring back at you
You need, you need me, yeah

What you got
What you need
Everything's gonna crash and break
What you got
What you need
Everything's gonna crash and break
What you got
What you want
What you need
Gonna be your savior
Everything's going to crash and break
But I know, yeah, I know
What you got
What you want

Gonna be your savior
Everything's going to crash and break
