Energy Lyrics
Power is another word that I use to describe You
Your mighty winds come in and blow me away
Frightening, coming at me like lightning
It's You that I fear, yeah, yeah
I shake whenever You speak my name

And I'm surrounded
You overpower me
You're the sun and rain, you're a hurricane
You are everything I cannot see and can't explain
You're an enigma wrapped in a mystery
Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy
Oh

Divine is a reality that You define
You defy time
I see You in everything in fire and wind and rain
Captured is just the word to capture how I feel when I'm still
You are what I crave
You set me free I wanna be Your slave

And I'm surrounded
You overpower me
You're the sun and rain, you're a hurricane
You are everything I cannot see and can't explain
You're an enigma wrapped in a mystery
Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape Your energy
Power is another word that I use to describe You
Your mighty winds come and blow me away

You're the sun and rain, you're a hurricane
You are everything I cannot see and can't explain
You're an enigma wrapped in a mystery
Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energy
I can't escape it
I can't escape
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Everywhere I go, I can't escape Your energyEmbed
