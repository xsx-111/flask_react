Forsaken Lyrics
I recall going madly in love with you
And I remember this
How could I forget?
Regret is a needle
In my neck
It's slowly filling me
With poison
Spreading to my chest

Take my pain and numb me from this

Why do I have to beg
When all that is left
Is a memory
Forsaken
Why do I have to beg
When all that is left
Is a memory
Forsaken

I recall pledging my sole devotion to you
It reminds me how
Now I am on my knees
My guilt consumes
Lost the will in me
Wasting away before you
Hold me closer please
Take my pain and numb me from this

Why do I have to beg
When all that is left
Is a memory
Forsaken
Why do I have to beg
When all that is left
Is a memory
Forsaken

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You break me
Forsake
You break me
Forsake
You break me
You're breaking me

I recall going madly in love with you
And I remember this
Tell me
Why do I have to beg
When all that's left
Is a memory
Forsaken
Why do I have to beg
When all that's left
Is a memory
Forsaken

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Forsaken
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me why, why, why, why2Embed
