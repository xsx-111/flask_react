Under My Skin Lyrics
When I feel you close to me
It's easy to believe
To the depths and back again
To find that I'm still needed
Feel the fear dissipate
When you are everything you are
Feel my soul come awake
You carry me away

When I hurt, when I bleed
You're holding me
Feel you scratching at the surface
Under my skin
When I hurt, when I bleed
You're holding me
Feel you scratching at the surface
Under my skin
Oh, under my skin
Oh, under my skin

Oh the sweet serenity
I'm beautifully addicted
You are more than I can take
I crave you undiluted
You calm the ache, I come awake
When you are everything you are
Feel the fear dissipate
You carry me away
When I hurt, when I bleed
You're holding me
Feel you scratching at the surface
Under my skin
When I hurt, when I bleed
You're holding me
Feel you scratching at the surface
Under my skin
Oh, under my skin
Oh, under my skin
Oh, yeah

Could I be lost
Could I disappear
Could I be lost
Would you find me here?
Could I be lost in a secret place?
Could I rest in the shadow of your face
Oh the sweet
(Could I be lost, could I disappear?)
Serenity
(Could I be lost, would you find me here?)
Beautifully
(Could I be lost in a secret place?)
A part of me
(Could I rest in the shadow of your face?)
When I hurt, when I bleed
You're holding me
Feel you scratching at the surface
Under my skin
Hurt, when I bleed
You're holding me
Feel you scratching at the surface
Under my skin
Oh, under my skin
Oh, under my skin4Embed
