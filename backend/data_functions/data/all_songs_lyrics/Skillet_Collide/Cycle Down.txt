Cycle Down Lyrics
Crashing, covered with debris
Dwelling in my own pity
Cry like I have not
Dig like I had not
I start to claw
Gotta get outta here
I've got to, got to get out

I am, I am, I am on a higher ground
You are, You are my cure from the cycle down
I am, I am, I am on a higher ground
You are, You are my cure from the cycle down

Sinking in a sea of self
Deception never sold so well
Regret like I have not
Pain like I don't want
I start to claw
Gotta get outta here
I've got to, got to get out

I am, I am, I am on a higher ground
You are, You are my cure from the cycle down
I am, I am, I am on a higher ground
You are, You are my cure from the cycle down
Down, down
Down
I'm so cold and I wonder
How'd I make it this long without You
Pull me out, out from under
On the cycle back to You

I am, I am, I am on a higher ground
You are, You are my cure from the cycle down
I am, I am, I am on a higher ground
You are, You are my cure from the cycle down
Down, down
