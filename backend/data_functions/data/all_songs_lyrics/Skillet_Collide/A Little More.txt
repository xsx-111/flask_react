A Little More Lyrics
Love is all around you now
So take a hold
Hidden in our words
It sometimes ain't enough
Do not suffocate day after day
It's building up
Cause when you are feeling weak
You know I'm strong enough

Just one more day
One more day

Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

Love is indestructible
So take a hold
Sometimes hard to find
A reason good enough
I'll stand beside you
Never leave through it all
And faith will bring a way
To the impossible
Just one more day
One more day

Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more

You can find me, you can find me
You can find me anywhere
Take a look over your shoulder
I'll be standing there
Standing there
Love is all around you now
So take a hold
And faith will bring a way
To the impossible

Just one more day
(You can find me, You can find me)
One more day
(You can find me anywhere)
Just one more day
(You can find me, You can find me)
One more day
(You can find me anywhere)
Let the world crash
Love can take it
Oh, let the world come crashing down
Oh, let the world crash
Love can take it
Love can take a little
Love can take a little
Love can take a little
Love can give a little more
A little more
Take a little more
Take a little more2Embed
