Fly The Flag LyricsGimme a country that's red white and blue
Gimme the British way honest and true
Gimme the chance to be one of the few
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
Gimme a nation where people are free
Free to do and free to be
Free to screw you before you screw me
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
(Chorus:)
Cos, I'm all right, I'm all right
Union Jack, fly the flag
Gimme a Britain that's got back the Great
A race of winners not cramped by the State
And only the helpless get left at the gate
Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme
(Chorus)Embed
