Keep The Thorns LyricsAn arrow straight through my heart
As we wade through the dark
I don't know what I'm gonna do now
While I dream of a plan to take you by the hand
And to lead you south of heaven
I want to do down
Take my where God can't hear a sound
We say goodbye as we lose our halos
So long! Farewell!
We say goodbye to the life we chose
So long! Farewell!
Guess I'll see you in hell
When the party is over
And we can be lovers
I know a spot in the head
Grab your drink and your coat
Take my hand and let's go
And resign oursеlves to defeat
If boys' drеams are made of a darker kind of love
I'll disregard the rose but keep the thorns
If girls' dreams are made of a sweet Satanic love
I'll disregard the rose but keep the thornsEmbed
