Sweet Tooth LyricsTonight, I hope you're dreaming
Of a life together in sin
That dream is a bloodstain of my mind
Let's elope, let's live like vampires
Drink each other and say up 'til sunrise
I'd live forever if you'd let me stay the night
I'll drive on past your house
And I'll say
"That's alright, that's the way I think of it
And that's okay I guess we'll never speak again
That's alright, I guess I'll just watch you from afar"
Beautiful boys in the pyre, pretty girls bathe in the fire
Hell was full so we just laid down and died
Making out in the confession booth
Bitty baby's got an awful sweet tooth
If it was true, I would have to lie
The postcard I'll write will read:
"That's alright, that's the way I think of it
And that's okay I guess we'll never speak again
That's alright, I guess I'll just watch you from afar"
Lay me down on the altar
Let me live my life like it's real
Hold me down again on the altar
Help me forget how to feelEmbed
