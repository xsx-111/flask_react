The Wild Side of Life Lyrics
You wouldn't read my letters if I wrote them
You ask me not to call you on the phone
But there's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went on back to the wild side of life

The glamour of the gay nightlife has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be somebody else's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know

I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went on back to the wild side of life

The glamour of the gay nightlife has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Where you wait to be somebody else's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know
I didn't know God made honky tonk angels
I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went on back to the wild side of lifeEmbed
