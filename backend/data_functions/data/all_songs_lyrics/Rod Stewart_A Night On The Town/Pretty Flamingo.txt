Pretty Flamingo Lyrics
Oh yeah
Ow!

All around all of the guys call her flamingo
'Cause her hair glows like the sun
And her eyes light up the sky
When she walks by
She moves so fine like a flamingo
Crimson dress that clings so tight
She's out of reach and out of sight

When she walks by
She brightens up the neighbourhood
And every guy would take her hand
If he just could, if she just would

Some sweet day
I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo
And every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

When she walks by
She brightens up the neighbourhood
And every guy would take her hand
If he just could, if she just would
Some sweet day
I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo
And every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be
C'mon, baby
Ow!

Girl, girl, girl I got toEmbed
