Big Bayou Lyrics
I took a long, long trip to the city
I was determined to get somewhere
I spent all my hard earned money
I had saved to put me there

Big bayou, where did you go now?
To the river that's running slow
And to the Gulf of Mexico
Big bayou, carry me home

Guitar, woo!

I took a cotton picking job in Memphis
And the people there treated me good
But my luck run bad in Nashville
I had to walk the streets of Hollywood

Big bayou, where did you go now?
To the river that's running slow
Into the Gulf of Mexico
Big bayou, carry me home
Ow!
Hit me
Gotta get away
Gotta find a way
Gotta get a way home
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh Lord, I'm going home
Where the fish jump in the air
You know I don't need a lot of money
'Cause I ain't going nowhere

Big bayou, where did you go now?
To the river that's running slow
Into the Gulf of Mexico
Big bayou, carry me home

Oh yeah
Woo!
Big bayou, where did you go now?
To the river that's running slow
Into the Gulf of Mexico
Big bayou, carry me home
Big bayou, carry me home
To the river that's running slow
Into the Gulf of Mexico
Big bayou, where did you go?

I'm gonna catch a southbound
Train home one of these daysEmbed
