Fool for You Lyrics
Hey baby
I gotta leave ya

By the time you read this letter, I'll be outta your life
Gone forever more but guess I'll survive
I'm gonna leave my records and a forwarding address
Ain't you glad, honey, that I'm off of your chest?
You said you wanted Paris, Rome and St. Tropez
Perfume by Chanel and a ring by Cartier
But I gave you headaches with my old fashioned ways
But that's all irrelevant to what I'm tryin' to say

I'm a fool for you, baby
Pride won't let me stay
I'm a fool for you, honey
And I'll come back any day
I guess I'll always love you all my life
Hey baby

You can keep your Streisands, Bardots and Lorens
You're my everything but now you're my end
It may be over but just before I go
I can make a new start but I can't mend a broken heart
So when I read about you in all the national press
On the arm of so and so, I may get depressed
'Cause I tried to love you but didn't fit in
I came on the dust, I'll leave on the wind
I'm a fool for you, baby
My pride won't let me stay
I'm a fool for you, honey
I'll come back any day
I'm a fool for you, baby
I don't care what your friends say
I'm a fool for you, honey
And that's the way I'll stay
I guess I'll always love you all my life

So long, babyEmbed
