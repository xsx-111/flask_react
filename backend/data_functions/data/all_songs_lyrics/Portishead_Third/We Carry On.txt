We Carry On Lyrics
The taste of life
I can't describe
It's choking on my mind
Reaching out I can't believe
That faith it can't decide

On and on I carry on
But underneath my mind
And on and on I tell myself
It's this I can't disguise

Oh can't you see
Holding on to my heart
I bleed the taste of life

The pace, the time
I can't survive
It's grinding down the view
Breaking out which way to choose
A choice I can't renew

On and on I carry on
But underneath my mind
And on and on I tell myself
It's this I can't disguise
Oh can't you see
Holding on to my heart
I bleed, no place is safe
Can't you see the taste of life?3Embed
