Machine Gun Lyrics
I saw a savior, a savior come my way
I thought I'd see it at the cold light of day
But now, I realize that I'm only for me

If only I could see, you turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place, no one else I face
The remedy to agree with how I feel

Here in my reflecting, what more can I say?
For I am guilty for the voice that I obey
Too scared to sacrifice a choice chosen for me

If only I could see, you turn myself to me
And recognize the poison in my heart
There is no other place, no one else I face
The remedy to agree with how I feel5Embed
