Small Lyrics
If I remember the night that we met
Tasted a wine that I'll never forget
Opened the doorway and saw through the light
Motions of movement and I felt delight

She spoke of freedom, "A way in," she said
"A wisdom that took me away from the bed"
Spoke of the glory that we had become
I felt forgiven in all I've become

Small, tasteless, and forgot
Hoping to see, blinded like me
You tried to understand, but you're just a man
Open to scorn just like me
Failure again
Tried to pretend
Who you were then
Who you are now
Hating the lord
Hating the lord
Hating the lord
Hating the lord

Small, tasteless, and forgot
Hoping to see, blinded like me
You tried to understand, but you're just a man
Open to scorn just like me
Failure again
Tried to pretend
Who you were then
Who you are now
Hating the lord
Hating the lord
Hating the lord
Hating the lordEmbed
