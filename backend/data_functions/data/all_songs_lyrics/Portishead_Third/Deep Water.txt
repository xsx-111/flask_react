Deep Water Lyrics
I'm drifting in deep waters
Alone with my self doubting again
I try not to struggle this time
For I will weather the storm
I gotta remember (Gotta remember)
Don't fight it (Don't fight it)
Even if I (Even if I)
Don't like it (Don't like it)
Somehow turn me around (Somehow turn me around)
No matter how far I drift
Deep waters (Deep waters)
Won't scare me tonight4Embed
