Nylon Smile LyricsI'd like to laugh at what you said
But I just can't find a smile
I wonder why you can't
I struggle with myself
Hoping I might change a little
Hoping that I might be someone I want to be
Looking out, I want to know someone might care
Looking out, I want a reason to be there
'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve you
And I don't know what I'll do without you
Looking out, I want to know some way might clear
Looking out, I want a reason to repair
'Cause I don't know what I've done to deserve you
And I don't know what I'll do without you

I can't see nothing good
And nothing is so bad
I never had a chance
To explain exactly what I meant2Embed
