Spanish House LyricsPetulance - you¹re out to gain
Bribery - it¹s the same old tale
Pestilence - it¹s your only way
Injury - (?)
Insanity - it¹s the way god slaves
The treachery of this crown jewel phase
Believe me, it¹s what we¹re heading for
Believe me, and no more
Don¹t go to the spanish house
cos you know it¹s a trap
Don¹t go
On the galleon sea
It¹s a mystery
Don¹t go
Eleven dead so the tv said
Don¹t go
You can stay
Possessions - the things you keep
There a well-timed secret that your enemies seek
Apathy - it¹s up to you
Secrecy - what the hell do you do?
Innocence - for you future is made
In this gold rush of these landmine days
I foretold your very actions
In the dim light of adventures now
Don¹t go
To the spanish house
cos you know it¹s a trap
Don¹t go
On the galleon sea
It¹s a mystery
Don¹t go
Eleven dead so the tv said
Don¹t go
You can stay
Petulance - you¹re out to gain
Bribery - it¹s the same old tale
Pestilence - it¹s your only way
Injury - (?)
Insanity - it¹s the way god slaves
The treachery of this crown jewel phase
Believe me, it¹s what we¹re heading for
Believe me, and no more
Don¹t go
To the spanish house
cos you know it¹s a trap
Don¹t go
On the galleon sea
It¹s a mystery
Don¹t goEmbed
