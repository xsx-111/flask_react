Crystal Ball LyricsI could be doing something new
Young fresh and exciting
Name an eccentric thing you won't do
And so you wanted to be free
Don't we all
What's past America
Are we so scared we can't see

And then you said that I had it all
Saw through your crystal ball
And saw me in depth
Like I'd never seen myself before
You seemed to think that
There still was more
But it's that crystal ball
It knows me too well
And I don't know myself at all
Suppose someone said to you
Your life's through
Or you've just got one more chance left to live
Which would you choose
You'd run to your mother to help you decide
We might as well all just stay in our rooms until we die
