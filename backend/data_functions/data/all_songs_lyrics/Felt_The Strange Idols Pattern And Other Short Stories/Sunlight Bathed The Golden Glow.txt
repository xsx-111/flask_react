Sunlight Bathed The Golden Glow LyricsYou're trying to fool somebody
But you end up fooling yourself
You read from the "A Season in Hell"
But you don't know what is about
I listened to you now
Maybe you'll listen to me
You're trying much too hard
To make your world seem like a dream
You're stepping out of something
Yeah, you're stepping out of line
Stop making a movie of it
Oh it's just my style
Stop sitting around and thinking
You're gonna do no good
I thought your poetry was sometimes good
You're stepping out of something
Sunlight bathed the golden glow
Stop making a movie of it
Stop telling the things I know
Stop sitting around and thinking
You're gonna do no good
I thought your poetry was sometimes goodEmbed
