Vasco Da Gama LyricsOut of it all comes shame
Like the villain who laid the blame
And like it wasn't me who said
That you're better off being dead
Out of it all comes a sense of despair
Your head wears your mind but your body is bare
You wake from your sleep and you know that it's true
You're starting to win but the game's nearly over for you
You know that it's true, yeah you
And everyone's through with you
And this day is through for you
Why is it only me that believes in honesty?
And like I've searched all the darkest mines
To try and find out where you lie
Somebody's changed and I know that it¹s you
But I'll take the blame 'cos I'm that kind of fool
And you say it's me, yeah that's probably true
Resigned  to the fact that the game's nearly over for you
You know that it's true, yeah you
And everyone's through with you
And this day is through for you
Out of it all comes shame
I was the villain who laid the blame
And like you know it was me who said
That you're better off being dead
Out of it all comes a sense of despair
The head wears your mind but your body is bare
You wake from your sleep and you know that it's true
You¹re starting to win but the game's nearly over for you
You know that it's true, yeah you
Everyone's through with you
And this day is through for youEmbed
