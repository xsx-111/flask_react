Roman Litter LyricsHey you can stop that game
I see your motives plain
You just wanna stop the rain
Hey
And when I close my eyes
I see a world of darkened skies
Filled with terror and surprise
Hey
You try to say it's over
Well that¹s alright
But will you do one thing now?
Tell everybody I¹m alright
And if you want to play
D¹you know a place where we can stay?
Push through and stop that day
Hey
And if you think it's fine
Then will you draw the line?
Push through these doors of mine
Hey
You try to say it's over
Well that¹s alright
But will you do one thing now?
Tell everybody I'm alright
And if you want to play
D¹you know a place where we can stay?
Roman litter on the way
Hey
You try to say it's over
Well that's alright
But will you do one thing now?
Tell everybody I'm alright (x2)
Don't try and tell me what is rightEmbed
