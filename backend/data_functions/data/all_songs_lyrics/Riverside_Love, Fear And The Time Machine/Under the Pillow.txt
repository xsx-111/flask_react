Under the Pillow Lyrics
Hey you
Somewhere in the mirror
What happened today with your face
Your eyes
Sank in their hollows
And the ocean of your disgrace
It’s no shame
You haven’t done what you were supposed to
And did what you didn’t want to
1-UP!
The amount of self-deception
Slowly starts killing you
Inside
You’re faced
With a new decision
Between the dawn and the day
Melting
Between the life you got used to
And something you don’t understand
I know
It demands an effort
And the pills to get rid of this pain
Not a chance
I’m sorry, Birdy
I’m your favourite voice inside your head
Hey you
Rise and shine!
You must learn to stand your ground
How long can you hold your breath under the pillow?

You kept yourself to yourself
Day by day
Growing delusions in the blue flowerpots
Your filter bubble
On the touchscreen display
Has recommended to you
What you should want
While you’ve been watching too much daytime TV
Dreaming on demand
Your ”from tomorrow” just became ”yesterday”
Made you crawl again
Under the bed covers

Hey you
Rise and shine!
You must learn to stand your ground
How long can you hold your breath under the pillow?
How long can you hold your breath under the pillow?
How long can you hold your breath under the pillow?Embed
