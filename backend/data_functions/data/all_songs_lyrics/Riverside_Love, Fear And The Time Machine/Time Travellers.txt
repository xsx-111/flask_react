Time Travellers LyricsOne day we'll find our way
Straying from the road
We thought we could go
Until we would fade
Traveling across the fallen earth
And the foreign lands
We survived
To believe that this is not the end
This is not the time
Moving unseen beyond
The shadows
Waiting for
The birth of a star we can follow
One day we'll find our time
Come to realize
That our history
Came full circle
Traveling across all the dried up seas
And the foreign lands
We survived
To believe that this is not the end
This is not the time
We crane our necks for youth
We know we’ll make it through
And we can go back to the forest
Let’s go back to the world
That was 30 years ago
And let’s believe this is our timeEmbed
