#Addicted Lyrics
I feel I have to share
What I do
Or where I am
There’s an urge within
I can’t ignore
Hashtag me and go
I’m addicted to your love
I’m addicted to my aimless drive
There’s a mask upon my face
I can’t live without
So you won’t recognize me
When I am in the crowd
I lost my calmness in the world
Where everything is searchable

Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out

I don’t have my place
I’m in here and everywhere
Just another day in hd frame
So hashtag me and go
Cause I’m addicted to your love
I’m afraid
You’re the only friend I’ve got
There’s a mask upon my face
I can’t live without
So you won’t recognize me
When I am in the crowd
I lost my calmness in the world
Where everything is searchable
Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out
Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out

Hashtag me and go
Cause I’m addicted to your love
I lost my calmness in the world
Where everything is searchable

Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out
Dreaming inside out
Feeling inside out1Embed
