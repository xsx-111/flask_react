Caterpillar and the Barbed Wire Lyrics
I want to fly
I want to feel my life
Still belongs to me
No matter what
I want to fly
I want to flap my wings
And cause a hurricane in your heart
Butterflies
Better lies than hate
But I can’t pretend anymore
I’m tired of suppressing all of my needs
I want to belong to the cloudless sky
Not to the shaded ground

But it’s so hard to admit
That I lived without your light
Trying not to believe that I need it more
Now the bleeding won’t stop
For I struggled through the barbed wire
Trying not to believe that I need your love
Trying not to believe in love

I wanted to turn into a butterfly
But I couldn’t trust you enough
I was tired of suppressing all of my needs
I wanted to belong to the cloudless sky
Not to the shaded ground
But it’s so hard to admit
That I lived without your light
Trying not to believe that I need it more
Now the bleeding won’t stop
For I struggled through the barbed wire
Trying not to believe that I need your love
Trying not to believe in love
But it got me nowEmbed
