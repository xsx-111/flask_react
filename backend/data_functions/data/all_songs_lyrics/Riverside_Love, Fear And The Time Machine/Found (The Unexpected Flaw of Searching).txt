Found (The Unexpected Flaw of Searching) Lyrics
Cut off from the dream
Where the sky meets water
Beneath forgotten stars
Feeling like a child
I embrace what I came for
And what I’ve overcome

Oooh, it’s a lovely life
You have gone so far
Don’t give it up
Oooh, it’s a lovely life
You gotta go with
What you think is right

Delve into myself
With my truth and devotion
I start another flow
Gliding up and down
In my yearning for daylight
I find you in my soul

Oooh, it’s a lovely life
Sun emerges from behind the clouds
Oooh, it’s a lovely life
You gotta go with
What you think is right
Cut off from the dream
Where the sky meets water
Beneath forgotten stars
I feel like a child
Found in waking lifeEmbed
