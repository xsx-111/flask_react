Lost (Why Should I Be Frightened by a Hat?) Lyrics
I dropped down again
From a star
On a desert island
Full of skies
And I saw a boy
Looking up
Dreaming of his future
From my past
Soon I drew an ocean
Tamed the sun
And I plunged my feet
Into the sand
Bit by bit I came
To understand
How I miss this freedom
And the swoosh of waves

Come
Follow me
We’ll go down where the river flows
One day
Just you and I
We’ll find the bridge to the neverland
I was frightened of
A thousand hats
Bouncing off the answers
Losing pride
Had a fear of failure
And true love
But I don’t regret that
I am what I lost

Come
Follow me
We’ll go down where the river flows
One day
Just you and I
We’ll find the bridge to the neverlandEmbed
