Towards the Blue Horizon Lyrics
Let me tell you a story
About you and me in those days
How much passion and joy
We shared
How often we turned back time
Let me tell you a story
About you and me in those days
When we felt as if we
Could change
The whole world with just one wave

As we ran through the silence
At the speed of sound
Towards the blue horizon
We could open minds

Let me tell you a story
About you and me in those days
We just lived our lives
Swam out
To the middle of the lake
As we ran through the silence
At the speed of sound
Towards the blue horizon
We could open skies
***
Where are you now my friend?
I miss those days
I hope they take good care
Of you there
And you can still play the guitar
And sing your songs
I just miss those days
And miss you so
Wish I could be strong
When darkness comesEmbed
