Discard Your Fear Lyrics
Once in the darkness of bad memories
You stepped into a trap
But the spring-loaded bar didn’t break your neck and you remained there

Waiting for the better time

Life with your passivity
In the face of choices, forced you to turn back
Settle with your lies
But the stubborn glass doesn’t want to talk to you

Waiting for the better time
Chairbound and bedridden heart

Discard your fear of the unknown
Be here and now
Just find yourself in peace
Try to free your mind
Wake up, get unstuck
Let it go, send your shame to nevermore
Your past, your distorted thoughts
Closed you in the box and cluttered up your head
Hewn from happiness in your fabletown

You're still afraid of starting something new this life

Discard your fear of the unknown
Be here and now
Just find yourself in peace
Try to free your mind
Wake up, get unstuck
Let it go, try to free your mind
Get unstuck, let it go
Send your shame to nevermore
Send your shame to nevermore

Discard your fear of the unknown
Be here and now
Just find yourself in peace
Try to free your mind
Wake up, get unstuck
Let it go, send your shame to nevermore
Let it go, scare away your fear
No more fear of new life
Fear of days of the unknown
Fear of new life
Fear of days of the unknown

Fear of new life
Fear of days of the unknown
Fear of new life
No more fear of love1Embed
