The First Supper Lyrics
Captain John Boyd crawls out from under the mountain of death
Blood running down his throat
Our bunch of heroes are different than a beast
When a man sees another man as nothing more than meat

All that blood finds it's way into a man's dreams
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a man's dreams
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a man's-

Oh, Captain John Boyd crawls out from under the death
With warmth of blood running down his throat
Our bunch of heroes are different than a beast
When a man sees another man as nothing more than meat

Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a man's dreams
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a man's needs
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a-
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a-
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a man's... needs
That eating the flesh of another man
Will give the other that man's strength
You can steal the soul by looking into the eyes
When the teeth sink in


"Turn from the gates of hell only to stare into the abyss."
You'd welcome death if you could find a noose that fits

Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a man's needs
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a man's dreams
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a-
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a-
Yeah, that blood finds it's way into a man's needs2Embed
