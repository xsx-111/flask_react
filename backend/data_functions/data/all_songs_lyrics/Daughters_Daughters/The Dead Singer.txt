The Dead Singer Lyrics
Hey there, on that cross
With your breath turned sickly and stale
Your eyes sunk back in your skull
That disaster through your hands
Hey there, little girl
With that charm hanging down 'round your neck
The, the damned are awash at your feet
And asleep in your dress
There's a voice in your ear
And it's promise sits empty and bare
It changes the look of your face
Though it's not really there
Now here in the ground
With our lips and breasts covered in dirt
We can't seem to get to our feet
We can't seem to breathe

The dead sing along (They're singing along)
The dead sing along (They're singing along)
The dead sing along (They're singing along)
The dead sing along (They're singing along)
The dead sing along (They're singing along)
The dead sing along (They're singing along)
You can't be that boy (Can't let it go)
You can't be that girl (Can't let it go)
You can't be that voice (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go, no, no (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go, you can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go, you can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go, no you can't (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go, you can't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go, you won't let it go (Can't let it go)
You won't let it go, you won't let it go (Can't let it go)
You can't let it go, you can't let it go
You can't let it go, you can't let it go
You can't let it go, you can't let it go
You can't let it go, you can't let it go
You can't let it go, you can't let it go
You can't let it go, you can't let it goEmbed
