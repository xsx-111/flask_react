The Theatre Goer Lyrics
Six million jaws hit a theatre floor
I rest my hand in something wet and warm
I feel you watching from the corner of your eye, yeah
If you move closer to me, I won't mind

Six million jaws hit a theatre floor
I rest my hand in something wet and warm
I know you're watching from the corner of your eye, yeah
If you move closer to me, I won't mind
I won't mind, I won't mind
I won't mind
I won't mind, I won't mind, I won't mind, I won't mind

Just make it last, last
Just make it last, last
Just make it last, last
Just make it, just make it
Just make it last, last
Just make it last, last
Just make it last, last
Just make it, just make it

It's your skin, it's your hands
It's your face, coming on, coming on yeah, coming on
But it's regret that
Makes the cab ride home such a drag
It's your skin, it's your hands
It's your face, coming on, yeah
But it's regret that
Makes the cab ride home such a drag
It's your skin, it's your hands
It's your face, coming on
But it's regret that
Makes the cab ride home such a dragEmbed
