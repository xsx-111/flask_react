The Virgin Lyrics
Paul wears a hat of fire
He says it's not so bad
If you can stand the smell of burning hair
Paul wears a hat of fire
Well he has so much love to give
But no one will get close to him
Paul wears a hat of fire
Well it's a lonely life
When no one will shake your hand
Paul wears a hat of fire
Well he says he doesn't see the point
To going out anymore

His mother always taught him right from wrong
Right from wrong
Well, he won't take it off
He won't take it off
He won't take it off
He has to take it off
Take it off

Paul wears a hat of fire
He knows you and your friends are talking about him
When he's not around, not around
Paul wears a hat of fire
He doesn't think you have any right
To question his motivation, question his motivation
Paul wears a hat of fire
He knows you won't be happy
Until he's lying dead in the streets, lying dead in the streets
Paul wears a hat of fire
When he is all but naked
With a handgun on your front lawn, on your front lawnEmbed
