The Unattractive, Portable Head Lyrics
"Lifeless, indifferent face on the wall
Who is the fairest moon this fall?"
I've spent a season with the wolves at the door
With dirty magazines, spread out, all across the floor
Some say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree
But that's just a lazy way to dismiss the seed
I'm going to put on a few hundred years
And I'm looking to earn them through your blood and your tears

Won't you to listen to the sound of my voice
And know I was created by chance not by choice?
Some may call that the death of the light
But I only call it "Embracing the night"
Too many hands are held out to take
And too many hands aren't prepared to break
Another season with the wolves at the door
Hungry and scratching and begging for more
They're always there

There is a future your eyes may not see
And there is a future you may not believe
There is a future that'll be here in time
But some won't make it to sign on that line
Some may not
I've seen an endless sky of ships explode
And realised some men, they will never make it home
It is a time when all of us will know
We'll find out if we're gonna reap what we sow
Or is it the other way around?

It's cold, it's cold
It's cold, it's cold
It's cold, it's cold
It's cold, cold, cold, cold
When the rain comes down and lose the tears as they fall
It's cold, cold, cold, cold
Pull a lesser man from a ledge and then and then and then...
And it's cold and it's cold
It's cold, it's cold
It's cold

I want to cast off the wings of desire
I want to be buried in a field of fire
I want to stand up and be twenty feet tall
I want to reach out and feel nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
I want to reach out and feel nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
I want to reach out and feel nothing, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
Nothing, feel nothing, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
I wish I'd feel nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
No nothing, no, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
I wish I'd feel nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
Oh, nothing, nothing, nothing
(Woah! Yeah!)
Nothing, nothing, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
Nothing, nothing at all
(Woah! Yeah!)
Well nothing, at allEmbed
