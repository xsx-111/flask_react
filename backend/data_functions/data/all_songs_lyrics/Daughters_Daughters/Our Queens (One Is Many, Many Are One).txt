Our Queens (One Is Many, Many Are One) Lyrics
Silence! Order! The queen is here
Arms and legs like kindling
One asleep down the road, the other in here
About as safe as a skeleton at the wheel, at the wheel

Silence! Order! Our queen is here
Adame, acrown, a death grip
So far away, can't see her face
But we can hear her scream over the airwaves
Maybe you oughta say goodbye, coming on too strong?

I want in, I want in, I want in, I want in
I want in, I want in, I want in
I want in, I want in
I want in, I want in, I want in, I want in
I want my cock in a hand on a train
I want in, I want in
I want in, I want in
I want the coolness and the numbness at my fingertips, my tips

Lips are at the wrist like razor blades
That throne of bone grows comforting
She closes her eyes, but not to go away
Could be my only chance to usurp the name, the name
She gets off all sensual
She gets off at the drop of a hat
She gets off at Chicago
She gets off in Paris
She gets off, she gets off
She gets off, she gets offEmbed
