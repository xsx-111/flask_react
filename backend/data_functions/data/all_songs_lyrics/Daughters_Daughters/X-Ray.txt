X-Ray Lyrics
Could you maybe be a little bit more naive?
Slide my shoes off my feet and
Rest myself in that seat
I call at fucking one
I call at fucking two
I call at fucking three
I'm drunk and hard and half asleep

Someone's out there
It's more than I can bear
Now shifting from side to side, playing along
Hanging up furious when somebody answers the phone
Alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone, alone
But I know, but I know where to go
Whoa, whoa
But I know, but I know where to go
Whoa, whoaEmbed
