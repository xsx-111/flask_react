Sweet Georgia Brown Lyrics
She's gonna cut you down
She's gonna turn you out
She's gonna make you wish you never seen her face before
She's gonna break you down
She's gonna put you out
She's gonna make an example out of you and your sorry, sorry skin, boy

You're dead already
Dead as a doornail, yeah I am singing to the dead
You wanna bring the right one home
But you'll end up with a hole in your head
She breathes fire
She sweats tar
She's a looker, but that's the surface
And that's what she wants you to know
She'll have you running up and down the street
You're asking advice from friends, neighbors and family
Water filled veins and stone cold heart
She's the Medusa of your deep blue sea
So don't go walking around, pretending that
You don't know what you know
She'll cut your throat before you could even
Wish, wish, wish, yourself home
She cuts your bones
She bleeds you out, boy
She cuts you down
She bleeds you out
She bleeds you out

Her business card is reading:
"They put my name atop the list
Of those who love you all away
They put my name atop the list
Of those who love you all away
They put my name atop the list
Of those who love you all away
They put my name atop the list
Of those who love you all away
They put my name on that list
Who love you all away
They put my name on that list
Who love you all away
They put my name on that list
Who love you all away
They put my name on that list
On that list, yeah
Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B
Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B
Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B
Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B, Sweet G.B."Embed
