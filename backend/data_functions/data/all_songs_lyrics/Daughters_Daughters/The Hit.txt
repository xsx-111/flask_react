The Hit Lyrics
A white man, a white suit, and a white horse
Rides into town, he rides off of that dusty ol' trail
He rides into town, not just any town. I'm talking d-e-a-d e-n-d
Integrity and his heart on his sleeve
He hopes they buy what he believes
He hopes they buy what he believes
He hopes they buy what he believes
Believes

Every fool and every friend
That's a population of one hundred and three
A cure to their un-Christian like ways
With a simple process of "drawing out"
Through the hole in the top of the skull
A snip, and then cut and a couple of knots tied off
He offers to make them as good as new
"Better than you're used to"

The locals didn't take kindly to this well intentioned man
They don't want a hand out from him
They take offence to a man coming into their town looking to tell right from wrong
And it's said this thing went from bad to worse
Well they string him up at the town hall
And it seems our smart-ass should have kept along
They should have kept along the trail
Kept along, along, the trail
Oh yeah, well it hit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well, it's a hit, yeah
Well it hit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well, it's a hit, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well it hit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well, it's a hit, yeah

They tell him
"The hands are the eyelids of the soul."
"The hands are the eyelids of the soul."
"The hands are the eyelids of the soul."
"The hands are the eyelids of the soul."

Well it hits
Yeah, yeah, well it's a hit, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well it hits
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well it's a hit, oh yeah
"The hands are the eyelids of the soul."
Well it hit
"The hands are the eyelids of the soul."
Well, it's a hit, oh yeah
"The hands are the eyelids of the soul."
Well it hit
"The hands are the eyelids of the soul."
Well, it's a hit, oh yeah1Embed
