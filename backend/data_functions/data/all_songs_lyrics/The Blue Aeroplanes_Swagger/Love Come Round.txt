Love Come Round LyricsThey say you hurt the ones you love, but I don't think it's true
The ones you love, they're just the most prepared
To be hurt by the things you do
So why so bitter, sweet thing?
Why so up in arms?
It's only your lover's sympathies, his misdirected charms
That keep you angered and upset, that keep you in alarm
But I see it's still your practice to hold him in your arms
Love come round and let me see
That a love unbound is a dangerous territory
Love come round and let me know
That a love unbound won't let you go
Now, your hair is like my lover's hair
Your style is like her style
When you smile, your eyes are hers
Yeah, when she used to smile
Your hips are like my lover's hips
Your lips are like hers when she grins
But your skin is like no other skin
I've ever held or ever will
Love come round and let me see
That a love unbound is a dangerous territory
Love come round and let me know
That a love unbound won't let you go
Well I woke up this morning
I walked around the corner to this little cafe
Yeah, suddenly, love came round the corner and hit me
Look out, look out, look out!
Well, there are a thousand questions you could ask me
But you only need one question to pin love in a lie
Yeah, you should know what love is when it looks you in the eye
When it looks you in the eye
Love come round and let me see
That a love unbound is a dangerous territory
Love come round and let me know
That a love unbound won't let me go
Love come round and let me see
That a love unbound is a dangerous territory
Love come round and let me know
That a love unbound won't let me go
Let me go
Let me go
Go, go, go, go
Let me go, let me goEmbed
