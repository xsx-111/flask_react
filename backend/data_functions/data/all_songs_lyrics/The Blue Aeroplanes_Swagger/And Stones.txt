And Stones LyricsHey you in that dress
Met up as long-ex-
That nervousness now much shared
And I wondered as we worked
Business to slip in little blames
About miles apart
Styles apart and miles apart
And stones
Lovers uptown we went uptown
There were lovers uptown we went uptown
Hey, we can get close close
Close on the one hand
Remembered on the other
But how we got too close in that mood
Yeah, I've been to your town
It was always someone else’s
It was never neat or sparse
There were never clues in there like ours
Lovers all around we went all around
There were lovers all around we went all around
I can say that for you
But don’t repeat it, don’t even think it
We’re all going backwards
The world's in division
Cross everyone else
But give me a description
Of what’s joint in this town
Describe an arc of your own
Describe yourself
Description
Smaller than thought
Wayward in intention
Not as wicked as people say
Send me a letter with clues
Send flattering dreams
Send love send stones send structures
Love is uptown we went uptown
There were lovers uptown we went uptown
Altogether now
Say my name and hi!
Smile and hold your head back
Close your eyes and take as read
Close your eyes then throw your arms around
Whoever you think it isEmbed
