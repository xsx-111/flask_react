Weightless LyricsIf we can't destroy it straight
We could at least murder the
Burn it out as we crash the dial
Know we're shuttle bound and poker faced
Talk it under the table
Linking hearts and dry flies played against us
Quote the bloody circumstance
Well that said
Violence is like drink
One's too many
But a hundred's not enough
Said, one's too many
And a hundred brooks no arguments
Well over here
The sound of violins
Drowned in gunfire
It's the water of life
At the edge of our sight
Half the world's floating in space
Like diagrams with consequence
How much falls to anyone else
They're walking down this hillside to clear water
There's something breeding, growing inside
Like sinister babies
The trees, followed in my laughter awry
Now, Swine, Scrobbler
He go where crowds go
Why you so bitter?
Crack the ban
Disguise like the satellites
Windows like with booby traps
Working down the body slowly
Hit on this
The watched lilly inside
Comes from this shared necessity
And when it's out
He's just going to poison the bloody water again
Yeah, Ok Ok Ok
Yeah, we can, we can go for a drink after work
We can turn native
Ha! it's a way of life
Yeah, it's a way of life
Sure
But I, I like being weightless best
No I like being weightless best
I liked being weightless best
I liked being weightless best
