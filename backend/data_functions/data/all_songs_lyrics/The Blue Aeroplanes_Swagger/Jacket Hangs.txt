Jacket Hangs LyricsPick a card, any card
Wrong
Pick 19th century twin-set pearls in a new clasp
Brass neck, collar me
Right
We need a suit, we press a suit so collar me
Collar me
Siamese cat drapes, roughneck honey
We press a suit, we set in train
We press a suit, we swan about, we set in train
We set in train, swan about
We swan about. We swan about
I believe in what passes for a centre, collar me
In spite of dress, your boyfriend link, crooked arm
I want to see inside
I want to see inside
I want to be inside
I want to see inside our most difficult act
We set in train, swan about
We press a suit, we swan about, from rack shop to hanger blade
We set in train, swan about
We press a suit, we swan about
That line around your eyes means
You can see, see better than I can, than I see you
Then I make contact. Swing, loosen up. Let those arms rotate
Like helicopter blades, lift, little jump and skip the rest
Like coral or groves the cards are marked
Your eyes are mine, coloured anew and set in train
I passed the test, I think I passed, I think I'm fine
Yes, jacket hangs just so and you're inside
We set in train, we press a suit
We press a suit, we swan about
We press a suit, we set in train
We swan about, we swan aboutEmbed
