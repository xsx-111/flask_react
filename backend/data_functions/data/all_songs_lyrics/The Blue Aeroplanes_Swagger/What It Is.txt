What It Is LyricsWatch these hands
Watch what they're doing
What is it?
They float around the neck like nervous birds
They circle the waist like sly torpedoes
Then they hike into the interior
You know how it is
You can be your enemy
Turn to sideways figure of eight
Oh we've each got our positions in this exchange of views
This oratory, this debate
You know, I think one of us should drink the other to tears
Well alcohol it composes to water
You know there's not much to it
The last part was nothing less than the same as the first
Your dark eyes, your blue eyes
Your dark eyes, your blue eyes
Oh memory's a house under rain
The morning was bright
I met your train
A haze of perception brought buildings closer and sounds from further away
I watched a kiss on private ground
And a phone box demolished by mistake
Just watch it explode
Yeah I know, I know, I know
He doesn't want you to speak
He's not sure if he even wants you to breathe
And if he says you're not gonna last a week without him
It's only what he wants you to believe
These lovers
You ask them to go, they won't come back
You ask them to stay, they won't go away
The morning was evening, train was a bus, it was dull, dull, dull
You've got something to tell me?
I can taste it
I can taste it
I know what it isEmbed
