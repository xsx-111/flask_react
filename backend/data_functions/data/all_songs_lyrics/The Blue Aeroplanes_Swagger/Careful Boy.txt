Careful Boy LyricsLooking at this world I've made
I don't feel there's much good in feeling proud today
And when I think of how we talked
How we started out
I feel a little bit lesser inside
Looking now at this careful mess
Looking at this room
Nothing ever seems to change
Oh, looking at this photograph
Things were better then, things were all so different then
You can kick me, you can punch me
You can say I speak the truth
You will never, never ever
Find out where it hurts
Oh we were young and free
We had things they couldn't even dream about
The fields were the greatest things I ever, ever saw and more
I ever saw in this whole world
All dressed up and no place to go
Always somewhere we can't go
You and I just sat down there
All we did was sit down there
And why, never saw, never knew?
Why, didn't you, didn't you?
Why, never saw, never knew?
Why?
The lorries that drive by now
Keep me awake
They've kept me awake for far too long
Long distance travel wears me out
Long distance travel tires me
Their sound is a sound I know too well
Every day gets a little longer
Talk, talk, talk and talk some more
You and I just sat down there
All we did was sit down there
And why, never saw, never knew?
Why, didn't you, didn't you?
Why, never saw, never knew?
Why?Embed
