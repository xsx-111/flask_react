My Forfeit LyricsOh I, Oh I
I'll sing to you, I'll sing to you what will age you young doe?
Oh I, Oh I
I'll sing to you, I'll sing you home, what will wise us?
I'll go through this after you wake, then begin again when you fall asleep
There's still light where you are and you my dear were not made to waste away
I saw the storm reach from the sky to the ground as dark as the day was bright
I can't go into this alone
My body will fall before I let you down
I know all about your weeping heart
Oh I, Oh I
I'll sing to you, I'll sing to you, what will age you young doe?
Oh I, Oh I
I'll sing to you, I'll sing you home, what will wise us?
My body will fall before I let you down
I'll make you proud before I love again
Oh I, Oh I
I'll sing to you, I'll sing to you, what will age you young doe?
Oh I, Oh I
I'll sing to you, I'll sing you home, what will wise us?
How shameful we've become, we left a child to untie sailor knots and eye the cresting rocks
Am I the one to choose?
How shameful we've become, if we overlook the captain's cries, we'll never kiss the shore
This isn't what I choose
My body will fall before I let you down
I know all about your weeping heart
My body will fall before I let you down
I'll make you proud before I love again
And how shameful we've becomeEmbed
