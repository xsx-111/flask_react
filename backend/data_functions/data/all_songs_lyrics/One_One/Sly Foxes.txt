Sly Foxes LyricsWe watch the waters rise
And let the tides come up to our neck
With pride taking on the ways
Screaming over and over again
"I never lie, I swear I can swim"
"I never lie" but there I go again
What have we become?
I feel like we have just begun
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best
I swear I'll never let go
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best
Oh we are so smooth
The way you speak...the way I move
So seek all you want, you'll never catch me
Jesting the hare and consuming the feast
I will shake the earth
Oh we are sly sly foxes
But this love will find us where we hide
This love will find us where we hide
This love will find us where we hide
Focus I want you at your best
What have we become?
I feel like we have just begun
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best
I swear I'll never let go
Focus I want you at your
Focus I want you at your best
Hold on, be strong
Stay steadfast you are your fathers son
Be still for the lion and lamb
Will lay as one
We watch the waters rise
And let the tides come up to our neck
With pride taking on the ways
Screaming over and over againEmbed
