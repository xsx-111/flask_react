OneOneThousand LyricsYou choose, you choose to run than see the truth be revealed
Climb the tallest tree and get the furthest view
Yet be sightless in a world made for your eyes
I thought I knew, I swore I knew
But sour milk and honey, is not the taste of you
So I stare straight into the sun
With fists clenched, waiting, to take flight
This body is so heavy, this body is so heavy
So I stand, with blistered feet and bleeding knees
Because here nothing can touch me
I'd rather dive then know what I would be without
Rather hold the line at fear. *be still and know*
That with one voice we'll sing together, together
Glory! Like the bee with out her queen, what am I with out my King?
You choose, you choose to run than see the truth be revealed
Climb the tallest tree and get the furthest view
Yet be sightless in a world made for your eyes
How alluring are the legs, of the fall
But hold the line, I'll hold the lineEmbed
