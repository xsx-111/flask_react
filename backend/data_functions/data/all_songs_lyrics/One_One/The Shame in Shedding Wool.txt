The Shame in Shedding Wool LyricsWhat wonderful strides with these legs
What a taste on these lips
With these ears i hear a thousand sirens sing
"just a bit further"
This skin it wears so well
With each step loosing wool
"be weary of the woods"
No
"be weary of the woods"
This pasture is much too bright
I need to shield these eyes
And make my way to the shade
Make a line for the trees
They only sing
To burn the forest down
"burn it down"
Come one come all
And bring what you've been fleeting from
"come home, come home"
Come as you are
And know you are loved
While you flee the sun
I heard the sheep cry
Out like wolves
Bring me to herd
I've been cold wandering alone
Bring me to love
Come one, come all
And bring what you've been fleeting from
"come home, come home"
Come as you are
And know you are loved
We wait with grace
While you flee the sun
"come home, come home, come home my love"
I heard the sirens cry
When the voice fell on deaf ears
While sheep they sang as one
HallelujahEmbed
