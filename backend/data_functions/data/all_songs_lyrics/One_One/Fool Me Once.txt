Fool Me Once LyricsI saw the flames, feeding a poisonous strength
Worthy of fear
But as a child with four second futures, I never dreamed
That you would take me to a place that’s quite like here
Say my brother, to think that I embraced in you
Say my lover, to think I thought of you my true
How do I look now, what would you have me do?
Say my lord, bring me the head of my youth
Tell me I am sleeping and this is a dream
So I can go on loving as you would have me
I won't let my rival feel the joy
I can see it all so clear
I saw the flames, feeding a poisonous strength
Worthy of fear
I am no fool, who did you think you’re talking to?
My silly little one
Betray me with a kiss, who did you think your messing...
My silly little one
Tell me I am sleeping and this is a dream
So I can go on loving as you would have me
I won't let my rival feel the joy
I can't see it all so clear
I saw the flames, feeding a poisonous strength
Worthy of fear
Say my brother, I sing a thousand thanks for you
Say my lover, what I see if you only knew
How do I look now, what would you have me do?
Say my lord, you brought me the body of truthEmbed
