Isadora Duncan LyricsOh Isadora how beautifully misunderstood
Is that what kept you moving moving
So ahead of you time but so far behind from where
You should be heading
Settle you heart settle you heart
Lead me with your little strong hands
I'll follow you to the of the world (you could be better than)
To end of the would where ever you wish If only you would let me
If only you would let me catch my breath (we could be better than this)
Rest your head and your weary eyes when we continue
We could be something so much more
What sort of view is my heart from a rearview mirror
What sort of view are you searching for
Oh Isadora
Surely you have just reason to run
What have you done
What is the cause
You could be so free
Reat your head and your weary eyes when we continue
We could be something so much more
What sort of view is my heart from a rearview mirror
What sort of view were you searching for
Oh Isadora rest your weary heart settle your soles
Know that where ever you are where ever you run
You're not alone

Oh Isadora oh Isadora
(You can me back for you)
Oh Isadora
(You can me back for you)
Oh Isadora
(You can me back for you)Embed
