Remember LyricsThey chased Us to the end of the dock
Stay with Me We can outlast night
Just stay awake I know We can
I know We can make It out alive
Make It out alive
We outlasted evenings, and I barely breathed
How couldn´t I see? How couldn´t I see?
Don´t turn your eyes if You leave now
You won´t remember me
You weren´t meant to do this on your own
No, I feel the water is calling
The wood under our bare feet cries
Every animal came to watch
The first and last to love die
What a wretched man I am
Who will rescue Me from this body of death?
Don´t turn your eyes if You leave now
You won´t remember me
You weren´t meant to do this on your own
Just stay close and I´ll keep You from leaving
Just move slow and I´ll keep You breathing
They chased Us to, the end of the dock
Stay with Me We can outlast night
Just stay awake I know We can
I know We can make It out alive
Make It out alive
Mother mercy the sea´s swallowed my graceful
I have failed You, I´ve been too late
Don´t turn your eyes if You leave now
You won´t remember Me
Don´t turn your eyes if you leave now
You won´t remember Me
You weren´t meant to do this on your own
Don´t turn your eyes if You leave now
You won´t remember Me
You weren´t meant to do this on your own
Just stay close and I´ll keep You from leaving
Just move slow and I´ll keep You breathingEmbed
