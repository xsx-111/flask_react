The Mason LyricsIf I could know the way this ends
I'd then understand
I'll live what It is to be made from the best of you
Let my hands make movement for hearts of the tested few
If I could know the way
The way this ends
I'd then understand (wooh oh wooh oh oh)
If I could know the way (wooh oh wooh oh oh)
I'd see the glory in these hands
I'm placing stone upon stone but this castle Is falling faster than my hands
They're gained the west wall fall back to the stabies
Prepare for the last stand
I end here you start now
Like iron sharpens iron I will make you better you will make me
My best like sea salt to my skin without you
I am but a tasteless man
If I could know the way
The way this ends I'd then understand (wooh oh wooh oh oh)
If I could know the way (wooh oh wooh oh oh)
I'd see the glory in these hands
This is end this is end
This armor weighs but I will fight till I face the sky
If I could know the way (wooh oh wooh oh oh)
If I could know the way
The way this ends
I'd then understand (wooh oh wooh oh oh)
If I could know the way (wooh oh wooh oh oh)
I'd see the glory in theseEmbed
