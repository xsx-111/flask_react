Modern Gentleman LyricsI saw the best on worst of everything
I dreamed I could be for you watched the sky
Be made for us I waited on the night
How numb was I how numb was I
I spoke of what we could of been
You said we were meant for this is where I need you to dream
Be fearless your courage will see this through
Don't be scared I need you to keep dreaming have hope for me
We spoke as children when placed on the streets
Then claimed the mind of giants when under the sheets
Yet he waits for us
I spoke of what we could of been
You said we were meant for this is where I need you to dream
Be fearless your courage will see this through
Don't be scared I need you to keep dreaming have hope for me
And I will find myself a proper hat will compromise Idol
And you you will find yourself a modern (and he will challenge the martyr)
I spoke of what we could of been you said we
Were meant for this is where I need you
I spoke of what we could of been you said we were meant for this is where I need you
I spoke of what we could of been
You said we were meant for this is where I need you to dream
Be fearless your courage will see this through
Don't be scared I need you to keep dreaming have hope for me
Don't be scared don't be scared to you keep dreaming
The child's gone now the father waits
For the legs of man to meet is may goneEmbed
