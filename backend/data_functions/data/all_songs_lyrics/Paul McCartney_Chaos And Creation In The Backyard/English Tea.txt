English Tea Lyrics
Would you care to sit with me
For a cup of English tea?
Very twee, very me
Any sunny morning
What a pleasure it would be
Chatting so delightfully
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
Every Sunday morning

Miles of miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively

Do you know the game croquet?
Peradventure we might play
Very gay, hip hooray
Any sunny morning

Miles of miles of English garden
Stretching past the willow tree
Lines of hollyhocks and roses
Listen most attentively
As a rule the church bells chime
When it's almost supper time
Nanny bakes fairy cakes
On a Sunday morningEmbed
