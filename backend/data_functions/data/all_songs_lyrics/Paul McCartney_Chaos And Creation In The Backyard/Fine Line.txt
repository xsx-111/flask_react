Fine Line Lyrics
Do, do, do, do
Uh, one, two...

There is a fine line between recklessness and courage
It's about time you understood which road to take
It's a fine line, and your decision makes a difference
Get it wrong, you'll be making a big mistake

Come home brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come home brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay

Whatever's more important to you
You've got to choose what you wanna do
Whatever's more important to be
That's the view that you've gotta see

There is a long way between chaos and creation
If you don't say which one of these you're gonna choose
It's a long way, and in every contradiction
Seems to say it's a game that you're bound to lose
Come home brother, all is forgiven
We all cried when you were driven away
Come home brother, everything is better
Everything is better when you come home and stay

Come on back, come on back
Come on back to me

It's a fine line
It's a fine line
Whatever's more important to you (It's a fine line)
You got to choose what you want to do
Whatever's more important to be (It's a fine line)
That's the thing that you've gotta see
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine line
It's a fine lineEmbed
