Riding to Vanity Fair Lyrics
I bit my tongue
I never talked too much, I tried to be so strong
I did my best
I used the gentle touch, I've done it for so long
You put me down
But I can laugh it off and act like nothing's wrong
But why pretend?
I think I've heard enough of your familiar song

I tell you what I'm going to do
I'll try to take my mind off you
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself

You're not aware
Of what you put me through but now the feeling's gone
But I don't mind
Do what you have to do, you don't fool anyone

I tell you what I'm going to do
I'll take a different point of view
And now that you don't need my help
I'll use the time to think about myself
The definition of friendship
Apparently ought to be
Showing support for the one that you love
And I was open to friendship
But you didn't seem to have any to spare
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

There was a time
When every day was young, the sun would always shine
We sang along
When all the songs were sung, believing every line

That's the trouble with friendship
For someone to feel it
It has to be real or it wouldn't be right
I keep hoping for friendship
But I wouldn't dare to presume it was there
While you were riding to Vanity Fair

While you were riding to Vanity Fair
While you were riding to Vanity Fair
While you were riding to Vanity FairEmbed
