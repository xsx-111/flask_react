This Never Happened Before Lyrics
I'm very sure
This never happened to me before
I met you, and now I'm sure
This never happened before

Now I see
This is the way it's supposed to be
I met you, and now I see
This is the way it should be

This is the way it should be for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own

So come to me
Now we can be what we want to be
I love you, and now I see
This is the way it should be
This is the way it should be

This is the way it should be for lovers
They shouldn't go it alone
It's not so good when you're on your own
I'm very sure
This never happened to me before
I met you, and now I'm sure
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)
This never happened before (This never happened before)1Embed
