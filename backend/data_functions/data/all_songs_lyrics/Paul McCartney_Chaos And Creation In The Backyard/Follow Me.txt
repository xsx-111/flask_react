Follow Me Lyrics
You lift up my spirits, you shine on my soul
Whenever I'm empty, you make me feel whole
I can rely on you to guide me through any situation
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me"

You give me directions, you show me the way
You give me a reason to face every day
I can depend on you to send me to any destination
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me", "Follow me"

Down the track of loneliness, down the path of love
Through the woods of heartache, to the end
On the shores of sorrow, where the waves of hope crash in
The perfect place for me to find a friend

You lead me to places that I've never been
Uncovering secrets that I've never seen
I can rely on you to guide me through any situation
You hold up a sign that reads "Follow me", "Follow me"

Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow meEmbed
