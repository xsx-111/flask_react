Jenny Wren Lyrics
Like so many girls, Jenny Wren could sing
But a broken heart took her song away
Like the other girls, Jenny Wren took wing
She could see the world and its foolish ways

How we spend our days casting love aside
Losing sight of life day by day

She saw poverty breaking up her home
Wounded warriors took her song away


But the day will come, Jenny Wren will sing
When this broken world mends its foolish ways

Then we'll spend our days catching up on life
All because of you, Jenny Wren
You saw who we are, Jenny Wren1Embed
