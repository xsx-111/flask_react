Search, Find Lyrics
Don't let the day keep movin' on with tears and pride
They hide the sun
Look to the road that lies ahead
I'm turnin' to the dream we left to die
Dyin' alone, cry for the moment you passed me by
Baby I don't now how , I'm only cryin' now

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search, find
No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Don't lose the will to make it right

A day is just a brighter night
And from the flames, a dyin' love can learn to fly
And rise above in me
All that we are, you are the heart of my everything
Maybe I lose my mind, I'm not the losin' kind

Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search, find
No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search, find
No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory

No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever

No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
