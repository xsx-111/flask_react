Reaching Out Lyrics
Watching every day go by, living in a foolish game
Just the way I feel today living my life without you
Never hear a single word, living in a lullaby
Praying every tear I cry living my life without you

And everywhere you go I fly
(I love you with a special feeling)
And darling till the day I die
(Baby never stop believing)

I'll be reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out
(There's a woman goin' through me)
I'll be reaching out
(Got a chance to hold you to me )
Everything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever, forever

Watching every day go by living on the one I love
What I got is not enough living my life without you

And I believe in yesterday
(Yesterday was once tomorrow)
With love, with love wide open every way
(Baby you're the light I follow)
I'll be reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out
(There's a woman going through me)
I'll be reaching out
(Got a chance to hold you to me)
Everything is lonely and I need you
Living my life forever
I'll be reaching out I'll be reaching out
Reaching out I'll be reaching out
Living my life forever

Reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out, I'll be reaching out
Reaching out, I'll be reaching outEmbed
