Stop (Think Again) LyricsFrom daybreak to sunset you are the heart of me
Saying what you don't really mean
Now I know where you go and all the plans you made
Playing for a love not a dream
All that I want is you now and somehow I let you down
Lost in my pain, that where I lie
You got to stop, think again, before you give it to him
Stop, baby, one of us got to lose
You gotta stop, think again, before you lost the heaven
Stop, baby one of us got to try
Oh, It's a great big world that we live in
Pleasure and pain, that's where I lie
You got to stop, think again, before you give it to him
Stop, baby, one of us got to try
Midnight you leave me taking the part of me
That loves you like he loves you, only more
Birds cry ,my sky falls
Darkness becomes my life, he got you
I got nothing to be living for
Oh, It's a great big world that we live in
Pleasure and pain, that's where I lie
You got to stop, think again before you give it to him
Stop, baby one of us, one of us, one of us
You got to stop, think again before you lose the heaven
Stop baby one of us got to tryEmbed
