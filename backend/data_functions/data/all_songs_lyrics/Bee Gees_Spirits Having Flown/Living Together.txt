Living Together Lyrics
Why ain't we living, living together
Instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we living, living' together
Instead of being so, so far apart
Why ain't we living' together, living together
Instead of being alone
Why ain't we living together, living together
Instead of being alone

I lay my heart on you and you can show the way
I give my everlasting love until my dying day
Take this lonely soul, the water or the wine
A chance to make you mine, I lay my body on the line

Why ain't we living, living together
Instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we living, living' together
Instead of being so, so far apart
Why ain't we living' together, living together
Instead of being alone
Why ain't we living together, living together
Instead of being alone
My life was emptiness until you came along
I nearly fell apart, you took my heart and made me strong
And I need all of you to get me through the night
A chance to see the light, I lay my body on the line

Why ain't we living, living together
Instead of being so so far apart
Why ain't we living, living' together
Instead of being so, so far apart
Why ain't we living' together, living together
Instead of being alone
Why ain't we living together, living together
Instead of being aloneEmbed
