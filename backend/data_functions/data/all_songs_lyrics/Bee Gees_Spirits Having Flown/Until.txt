Until LyricsYou were a lovely child
And your hair was like the morning sun
And I knew we were in love
We were alone to dream a dream
We held our love that held our hearts
And who are we who knew
All there was in life and coming through
And ev'ry lonely sad mistake
Every change and interchange we make
We held our love and that held our hearts
Until, until , oohh
Ahh .....Embed
