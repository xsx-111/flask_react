Spirits (Having Flown) Lyrics(1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah...
I never fell in love so easily
Where the four winds blow I carry on
I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies
We go alone
Never before
Having flown
Faster than lightening is this heart of mine
In the face of time I carry on
I'd like to take you where my rainbow ends
Be my lover friend
We go alone
Never before
Having flown
I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live
In the air?
You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there
You'll never know what you have done for me
You broke all those rules I live upon
I'd like to take you to my shangri-la
Neither here or far
Away from home
Never before
Having flown
I am your hurricane
Your fire in the sun
How long must I live
In the air?
You are my paradise
My angel on the run
How long must I wait?
It's the dawn of the feeling
That starts from the moment you're there
There I'd like to take you where my spirit flies
Through the empty skies
We go alone
Never before
Having flownEmbed
