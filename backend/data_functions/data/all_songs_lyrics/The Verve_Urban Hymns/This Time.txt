This Time Lyrics
Looking back on my life
You know that all I see
Are things I could have changed
I should have done
Where did the good times go?
Good times so hard to hold
This time, this time
This time I'm gonna find

Looking back on my life
You know that all I see
Are things I could have changed
I could have done
No time for sad lament
A wasted life is bitter spent

So rise into the light
In or out of time
Going to rise straight through the light
In or out of time
Woke up one other day
The pain won't go away
I am growing
In peculiar ways
Into a light I pass
Another dream, another trance
This time, this time
This time I'm gonna rise

Rise into the light
In or out of time
Gonna rise straight through the light
In or out of time
Gonna find my way in life
In or out of time
Gonna rise straight to the light
In or out of time

I'm gonna see the light
I'm gonna see the light
Cause I know there is time
There is time...1Embed
