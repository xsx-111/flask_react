Catching the Butterfly Lyrics
So you born
And so you thought
The future's ours
To keep and hold
Oh child within
Has healing ways
It sees her through
My darkest days

I'm going to keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
I'm going to keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine

In my lucid dreams
In my lucid dreams

Something now?
Through life no fun
I want to feel
I want to run
I'm going to keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
I'm going to keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine

In my lucid dreams
In my lucid dreams

I'm going to keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine
I'm going to keep catching that butterfly
In that dream of mine

In my lucid dreams
In my lucid dreams

My forgotten schemes
I see through you
You see through me
I see through you
You see through me
Be with me
Be with me
I see through you
You see through me
I see through you
You see through me
To be in your eyesEmbed
