The Rolling People Lyrics
Big shout out

I got one more life
Can you see it wasting away?
But I got a plan
Do you understand?
The drugstore wife
I was dealing soul and other white
I won't shake your hands
Cause death has no plans

But here we are the rolling people
Can't stay for long
We gotta go
So come alive with the rolling people
Don't ask why
We just know

I'm on a big jet plane
With my briefcase and crime in my veins
I'll be the first to toast
To my rotten soul
But here we are the rolling people
Don't ask why
We don't know
So come alive with the rolling people
Don't ask why
We just know, yeah

Don't even know which way I'm going to
The lights are on and I am feeling blue
I hope you know which way I'm going to fly
Thank you for my life
I said good night, good-bye
You see me going

But here we are the rolling people
Can't stay for long
We gotta go
So come alive with the rolling people
Don't ask why
We don't know now, yeah

Rolling on and on and on and on, ooh
You know I'm burning up, and up, and up
And up, and up, and up, and up, and up, yeah
Yeah
It doesn't look that bad, I can see my Dad
Yeah, it doesn't look that bad, oh, it doesn't look that bad
Oh, gonna take you home now, I'm gonna take you home now
Gonna take you home now, gonna take you home now
Gonna take you home now, we're gonna take you home now, now, now
We're gonna take you home now, now
We're gonna take you home now, now, now
We're gonna take you home now
We're gonna take you home now
We're gonna take you home now
We're gonna take you home now
We're gonna take you home now
We're gonna take you home now
We're gonna take you home now
We're gonna take you home now
