Lucky Man Lyrics
Happiness
More or less
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my
Happiness
Coming and going
I watch you look at me
Watch my fever growing
I know just where I am

But how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

Well, I'm a lucky man
With fire in my hands

Happiness
Something in my own place
I'm stood here naked
Smiling, I feel no disgrace
With who I am
Happiness
Coming and going
I watch you look at me
Watch my fever growing
I know just who I am

And how many corners do I have to turn?
How many times do I have to learn
All the love I have is in my mind?

I hope you understand
I hope you understand
Oooooooh
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
Gotta love that'll never die

Happiness
More or less
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Happiness
Coming and going
I watch you look at me
Watch my fever growing
I know
Oh, my, my
Oh, my, my
Oh, my, my
Oh, my, my, my, my
I got a love that never dies
I got a love that'll never die
No, no
I'm a lucky man
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty (don't think, don't, don't think I'm lying)
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty (don't think, don't think I'm lying, I'm flying, come on now)
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my
Oh, my, my
It's just a change in me
Something in my liberty
Oh, my, my, my, my, my, my (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, my, my, my, my, my16Embed
