Bullfrog Green LyricsHe had a ticket
But what was weird
They found it in his ear
She gave a fortune
To those in need
But her heart was saved for me
Blue balloon for you, red balloon for me
(Monday is my birthday, Tuesday is her birthday)
Outside (3x)
The sky is filled with rain
I'm glad to be home again (2x)
Oh yeah
The sky was bullfrog green
Man you would have been amazed
The rain beat up the fields
My mind turned from less fortunate daysEmbed
