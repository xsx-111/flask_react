One Last Hurrah LyricsWords don't mean a thing they tend to be just what is said to get by
Without a sign, of what is in your head, words alone cannot condone or
Condemn anyone, ease your pain or rearrange something that's been done
But what's to say anyway
One last time and then, I couldn't manage
Anymore, I know I should think more about it
I know I should try for one last hurrahEmbed
