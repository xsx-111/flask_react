New Brighton Promenade LyricsNew Brighton Promenade
What am I trying to say?
You were just on my mind
Do you remember me?
This life is not easy
The one thing that can please me
The memory of me and my friends
Kicking round your shore
New Brighton Promenade
It's 1983
For ever on the place
Whether I choose to be
And time has passed quickly
The years have been kind to me
The memories go with my friends
Will always be around
You still exist inside my head
There's no such thing as being dead
When somebody keeps your ghost inside
And if you looked inside my head you wouldn't
Find a mind instead
Step into New Brighton Promenade
This life is not easy
The one thing that can please me
The memory of me and my friends
Kicking round your shoreEmbed
