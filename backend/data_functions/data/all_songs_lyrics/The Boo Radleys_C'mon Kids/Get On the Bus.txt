Get On the Bus LyricsThough you know you have to go
It's much too hard to do
Pack all your things
Though you only have few
We have got no business here
There's nothing left for us
Get on the bus...
Streets stretch out miles ahead
Half blind, wishing I'd come to bed
Where is he? I told him here
On this day and at this hour
I don't wanna make a scene or cause a fuss
Here it is right on time, it really is a must
Get on the bus
Streets stretch out miles beyond
Here we curse this place on time
Where next I've no idea
Ask the driver if you care
I don't wanna make a scene or cause a fuss
Everything you want is here, everything's a must
Get on the bus
So we proved we're alive
Showed that we can beat time
Another one joins the line of those who've died
But I still see
Yes I still hear
And oh! what a time we had
Oh! what a time we had...Embed
