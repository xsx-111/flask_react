Four Saints LyricsLeaves everywhere outside your house
Running after you 'cause you walk too fast
And we can't find a cab
Looks like the Northern Line again
I am the voice
But not the sound
I can go up
Yet still be down
And you don't know the places
That I've been to
Wouldn't like me
If you knew
Remember that time outside your room
Playing with the cat just me and you
It was my favourite time
My world stopped for just an hour
I am the voice
But not the sound
I can go up
Yet still be down
And you don't know the places
That I've been to
Wouldn't like me
If you knew
Whatcha gonna do when it all breaks down?
Whatcha gonna be when you lose the sound?
Don't remind me, I cannot say
What happened to the fire that got you through
The days when nothing went right for you?
Hey, nothing's changed, I'm still the same
Hey, boy, what's the score?
Don't you give a shit about yourself no more?
(If you don't want me to be real, don't look up to me.)
There are three saints that shaped my life:
Alban, Bede, and Mary
I've nothing but disrespect for them
And what they almost made me
Those who taught, taught what they were taught
And not what they had learned
Sister, I can't feel what you feel
Let me try
Brother, lay your arms down
And open your eyes
I believe in love
Laugh if you must, I don't care
'Cause I don't dare...Embed
