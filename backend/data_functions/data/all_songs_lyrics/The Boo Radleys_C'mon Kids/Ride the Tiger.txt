Ride the Tiger LyricsI don't really need to be the way I are
I don't really need to always go so far
I could get by on being alive but having no life
I don't really need a fuel infected car
I don't really need (or want) to be some kind of star
I could get by on being alive but having no life
You don't really know what it is you ask
All that I want is to find some peace at last
Take it further
