Shelter LyricsI remember at school there was always some fool
Teaching us about the past
Pictures of kids, starving, eating out of bins
Man we all had to laugh
It's hard to believe we were told with relief
It couldn't happen now of course
It's easy to expound with your head in the ground
I've since learnt that and more
What is there to do I'm allright so are you
But outside there are TB streets
You can cry a lot say â€˜Oh! my God!'
But as an action it is incomplete
Put money in the hands of those who understand
Give shelter of the roofless heads
It's hard to deny when you open your eyes
And listen to yourself instead
And you'll think you've gone crazy
But you hope it will pass
It's a sickening feeling maybe it won't last
It shouldn't be happening at this point in time
With these houses standing emptyEmbed
