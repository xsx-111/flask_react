Fortunate Sons LyricsYou're pretty and you know it
You're stupid and you show it
If there's a soul behind your face at all
I'm struggling to see it
Now smile for the camera
You've got what they're after
Yes it's all you wanted
But it's that has suffer to suffer this
The best clubs in London you'll always
Be around them
But drinkin' ain't livin' and
Drinkin' ain't givin'
Nah drinkin's just drinkin's just drinkin'
My sister's father had a wife
Whose husband had a father
Who taught me how to live
But died all alone
And I wish that I was with him
I could tell him all the things that he's missed
And all the things that you think
When you think that you're alone
But, man, you can't see what's going on
At the minute you can do nothing wrong
Yes you are a fortunate son
But you won't fool the kids for longEmbed
