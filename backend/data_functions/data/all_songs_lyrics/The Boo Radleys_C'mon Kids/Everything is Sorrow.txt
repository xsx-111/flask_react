Everything is Sorrow LyricsAnd you know you shouldn't have another cigarette
But nothing else makes much sense, nothing else will recompense
And you get your loneliness out of a magazine
You never felt nothing at all, no one else need ever know
Another one has dragged you home
And sworn that you're the only one
You dream they'll play a special part
You write their name upon your heart
But then it's back inside your head
The thought that it will turn out bad
A fleeting glimpse of what is bound to be
Don't paint blue all the time
Know the truth, read the signs
Live your life as a lie
You don't have to die
Now the phone has lost its voice
You're on your own again
Spend your time on endless bedroom floor soliloquies
The only voice you'll hear all day
Will it always be this way? (yes)
Once you recognize the truth
That all is sad and you're the proof
You might as well fight the day
Kick back at the pricks who say
That all is school and work no more
Break your back, it's not your war
Disengage, the only way to win
Don't paint blue all the time
Know the truth, read the signs
Live your life as a lie
You don't have to die
Opened up my paintbox
It had all turned to blue
I worked in Birkenhead for you
It brings me tears even now
You tried to kill me, break my will
You almost won, I hate you still
The hated suffer not, what's worse
The hater carries round the curse
It eats me up, the cancer that is you
Don't paint blue all the time
Know the truth, read the signs
Live your life as a lie
You don't have to dieEmbed
