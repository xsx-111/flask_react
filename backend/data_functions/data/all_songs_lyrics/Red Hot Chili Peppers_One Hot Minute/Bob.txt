Bob Lyrics
Well, my friend Bob's in jail today
His girlfriend is too
For stealing change for gasoline
Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the proof
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob
I met him on the boulevard, Hollywood and Vine
He said, "You're gonna be a superstar"
I said, "That's fine, sublime"
He loved my crime
But there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

Hanging late all through the night
Blackest flag at dawn
A lust for life that kills itself before it gets too strong, that's wrong
Please be lifelong
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob…
I never see you
I never see you
I never see you

Killing yourself, I hear your voice on the phone
The sound is so far away
Remember the home and how they left us alone
Remember our friend, oh
Stealing everything in the store
You know I want you to stay
Remember the home and how they left us alone
Friends fade away…

Well, my friend Bob's insane today
I know I am too
The mental patients laugh and cry
Nothing to do but rue
Destroy the proof
'Cause there will never be another one just like you, no
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob...Embed
