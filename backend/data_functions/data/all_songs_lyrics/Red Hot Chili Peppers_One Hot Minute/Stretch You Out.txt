Stretch You Out Lyrics

Stretching out your tightness
Good enough to make you grow
We are all in favor of this motion
Stretching out your tightness
Time to open up your hole
When it rains, I let myself get wet
I have always wanted to
Give something to my brother
Proposing to expose your head
To something that is like no other
Hit it

I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out, my friend
I'll stretch you out

The juice that flows from intuition
Is my liquid friend
We are all in favor of the open end
Three pounds of love and knowledge
Are expanding in my skull
Truth be told, we let the good times roll
I have always needed to
Receive it and believe it
And it's braiding and creating love
Tender titillation
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out, my friend
I'll stretch you out

I'm a fish and I can swim all day
I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong
I'm a bird and I can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong
Owwwwwwww....

There's a glowing offer up around the moon
It's showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing
Very legendary
Extra planetary fairy
Very true, she's making just for you
Yes I have always wanted to
Give something to the stranger
M-m-m-moving to improve the groove
A mental transformation
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out again
I'll stretch you outEmbed
