Warped Lyrics
My tendency for dependency
Is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see to be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me

So much love, so rare to dare
Afraid of ever being there
Take me home, I need repair
Take me please to anywhere

Descend
All the way, all the way
(Woah!)

Descended from demented men
Struggle with the art of Zen
Please don't look too close at me
You might not like what you see

She said
All the way, all the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there, of being there
Night craving sends me crawling, oh
Beg for mercy, does it show?
A vacancy that's full of holes
Hold me please, I'm feeling cold

She said
All the way, all the way
Everyday
Warped and scared
Of being there, of being there
