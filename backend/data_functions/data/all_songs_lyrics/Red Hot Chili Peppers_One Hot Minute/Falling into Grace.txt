Falling into Grace Lyrics
What ever never knew that I could feel so good
Smile in your eyes
What ever never knew that I could walk through wood
I guess I never tried
A million years old, but just a little girl
Vibing off the gong
Rubbing on the bowls make you float around
Make your loving strong

And when we get in the same place
At the same time, it is your grace
That I want to fall right into now
To love avow

I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I said I'm falling into grace with you, oh yeah
I'm falling into gurumukh

She moves in a rapture that her capsule might
Land on your star
Meditating in the morning, head dressed in white
Beauty bazaar
You can smell the purple light coming from her heart
Get lost and wet
I treat you like a teacher 'cause that's what you are
I wanna be your pet
And when we get in the same place
At the same time, it is your grace
That I want to fall right into now
To love avow

I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I said I'm falling into grace with you, oh yeah
I'm falling into gurumukh


I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I said I'm falling into grace with you, oh yeah
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
Oh, Lord, I'm falling into grace with you, with you
I'm falling into gurumukhEmbed
