Walkabout Lyrics
I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat, I got myself to meet
A detective of perspective, I
Need to try and get a bigger eye
Open wide
Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
Do me now

On a walkabout

You can do it in the city, you can do it in a zone
You can do it in the desert, you can do the unknown
On a walkabout
High desert skies are what I spy
So fly, you gotta wonder why, hmm
The stingrays must be fat this year
They're moving slow in my lowest gear
The didgeridoo original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout

You could do it with a shuffle, you could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride, you could do the unknown
On a walkabout, mmm hmm
A walk could cure most all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One, two


I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
Can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side
