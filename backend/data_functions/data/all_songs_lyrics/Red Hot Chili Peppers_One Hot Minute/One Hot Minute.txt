One Hot Minute Lyrics
I was riding, riding on my bike
Me with my friend, we're so alike
Am I all alone

She said all we have is this
We just had to stop and share a kiss
Am I all alone

One hot minute
And I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute
And I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute
And I'm in it, come and get it
If I chase it
I might waste it, come and spin it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
Close your eyes and click your heels
Can you believe how good it feels?
Am I all alone

One hot minute
And I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute
And I'm in it, come and get it
One hot minute
And I'm in it, come and get it
If I chase it
I might waste it, come and spit it

Am I all alone
Am I all alone

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your mama, pay your father take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow

Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives, it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done

Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Or maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire2Embed
