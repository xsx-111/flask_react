Tearjerker Lyrics
Could you turn up the track a little bit please?

My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth would not be true
Refuse the news
I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I supposed to do?
Just lose and lose

First time I saw you
You were sitting backstage in a dress
A perfect mess
You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love

Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
I liked your whiskers
And I liked the dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes
You painted pictures
'Cause the one that hurts can give so much
You gave me such

Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so13Embed
