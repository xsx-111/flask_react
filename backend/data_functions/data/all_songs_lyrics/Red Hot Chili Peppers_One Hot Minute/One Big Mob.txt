One Big Mob Lyrics
I am you are me
I am you are me, who
I am you are me
I am you are me
Good woman said you've got to believe
Submerge into the urge of we
Deliciously the mystery
The mystery

One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob is...

Ooze into into my noodle
East or west shepherd or poodle
Ladybug pine tree to mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun and a brother to the cool breeze
One big mob is...

One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob is...
We live in the city, we live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking, a thimble humble
Everything you ever see is never more than you and me
Give it on in to the beauty of the mystery
One big mob is home

One big mob in one big home
A broken home
I'd like to share some air with you
Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
To give and give

What was I thinking in my head
The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration, I
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost
A sullen cost
I am you are me
I am you are me, who
I am you are me
I am you are me
Good woman said you've got to believe
Submerge into the urge of we
Deliciously the mystery
The mystery

One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Ek bara mala (oh yeah, oh yeah)
One big mob is...

Scrawled upon the wall of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note that spoke to all
One, two, buckle my shoe
Take care of me 'cause I might be you
One big mob is...

Peek-a-boo street in Timbuktu
Do I need to repeat that a boy named Sue
Rocking to the beat of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet and forehead too
One big mob is...
