Kala LyricsDo you recognize me
Here on this sleeper train
And do you feel the pain
Growing into the night,Mary
And i can feel the taste
Of your birthday cake
Remember how it was
To hold you into my arms,Mary
It wasn't there
The summer lights around
I wasn't there
His hand upon my knees
And we're gone
Across the sunny streets
And we're gone
The day you died,Mary
And we go faster now
Together throught the fields
Here on this sleeper train
And i can touch your face, Mary
The precious things we've done
Hidden under my skin
I let you sleep a while
I leet you sleep
A while, Mary
It was there
The summer lights around
I was there
His hand upon my knees
And we're gone
Across the sunny streets
And we're gone
The day you died, MaryEmbed
