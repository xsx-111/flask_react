A Secret Place LyricsI walked into the street
To see myself looking back at me
So many eyes
It's in the way I walk
Just wanna be touched in the right way
Like everybody else
Like everybody else
A secret place in a lover's arms
I know a place not far from here
??? secret place
In each others' arms
And for this cause we will light the fire
It's growing (groping???)
Push it down with one hand
The other fanning the flames
To a rage
Of love and hate
And of betrayal
In the life of a man who's blown his last chance
Some secrets are too great to keep to yourself
For it jumps and tickles inside my skin
Scratching like a dog in ???
(Chorus) I walked into the street
(Chorus) To see myself looking back at me
(Chorus) So many eyes
(Chorus) It's in the way we walk
(Chorus) Just wanna be touched in the right way
(Chorus) Like everybody else
(Chorus) Like everybody else
A secret place in a lover's arms
I know a place not far from here
It's a secret place
Don't keep away
Come to the cause
Come fuel the fire
It's growing
Push it down with one hand
The other fanning the flames
To a rage
Of love and hate
And of betrayal
In each others' arms
I know a place not far from here
This train is rollin' on (x7)Embed
