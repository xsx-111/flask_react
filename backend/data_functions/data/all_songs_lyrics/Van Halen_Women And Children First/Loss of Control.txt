Loss of Control LyricsMayday, mayday
Mayday, mayday

Well, baby, I checked it out, I think you ought to know
I'm only wastin' time, I think I'd better go
You're way too civilized, oh
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control

Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control

Baby, I checked it out, I think you ought to know
I'm only wastin' time, I think I'd better go
You're way too civilized, oh
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control

Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of control
Baby, I checked it out, I think you ought to know
I'm only wastin' time, I think I'd better go
You're way too civilized, oh
Loss of control, loss of control, loss of controlEmbed
