On the Way Lyrics
I would like to come and see you
But what is it worth to know?
Promise you will make it easy
You would not get me to go
I have been a wreck so long it is hard to pull it back
But I am on it, and
I want it, and
You flaunt it, and
It wakes me, and
It takes me, and
It rapes me
Gone away
On the way I want to let you go
I got a little red
Just can't pull it together
Before it goes to your head
Gone away
On the way On the way On the way

I would like to come and see you
But I think I am on my way
Gone away Gone away
On the way On the way
On the way gone away
I have been a wreck so long; it is hard to pull it out
Look to me, I feel the fool againEmbed
