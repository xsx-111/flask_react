Hide Lyrics
You know it hurts me
To see those people hangin' 'round you all the time
What about someday
To know you're laughing there is messin' with my mind
Damage setting in
Tell me where you been
Try not to ask again
Flake outs I can't defend
Twisted messages I send
I walk over and we smile and all get set
Where we take 'em
Is where I wake up
It's a vice that's feeling tight around my head
I can't place it
Still can't waste it
It's kind of useless
To tell you everything that needs to end today
I'd be confused less
If you just grab me, wave and be on your way
I can't let it go
Starting to really show
Don't you think I've tried
Don't you want it inside
What could be left to hide
You know it hurts me
To see those people hangin' 'round you all the time
It sure seems lonesome
But you're still hanging with them, it's messin' with my mind
You cannot expect much
Not so out of touch
If I ask again
Nothing I'll defend
But I can pretend
I walked over and we smile and all the rest
Where we take up
Is when I wake up
It's a two ton weight that's wrapped around my chest
I just knew it
Can't get through it
And now it's finally just inches from my eye
I can't place it
Still can't waste it
When you stomp on the last thing I've left to try
Is where I wake upEmbed
