Start Choppin Lyrics
There's no going back to that
I'm so numb, cannot even react
Did not say it's not okay
But we aren't feeling the same way
I ain't telling you a secret
I ain't telling you goodbye
It is the last thing on my mind
Still you would not let things unwind
Spinning tight around your head
Can't you hear a word I said
I ain't telling you a secret
I ain't' telling you goodbye
When you call it is just not fair
It is the last thing you should share
If I can't deal; I'll let you know still
I wish you'd let it go
I ain't telling you a secret
I ain't telling you goodbye
I'm telling you for one last time
It is not just you; the problem is mine to hide
I waited as long as I could if you need it, sure
I would, that is fine

Well, There is no going back to that
So numb can't even react
Didn't say it is not ok
But we are not dealing the same way
I ain't telling you a secret
I ain't telling you goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm telling you for one last time
It is not just you; the problem is mine to hide
I waited as long as I could if you need it
Sure I would, that is fine
I'm taking away a lot of stuff
I'm telling you it is rough but not goodbye
