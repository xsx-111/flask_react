Out There Lyrics
I know your name
I know the people out there feel the same
I know you're gone
I hope you got some friends to come along

I know you're out there
I know you're gone
You can't say that's fair
Can't you be wrong?

I feel ok
Sure, I know that's not what people say
Maybe they're wrong?
Maybe you weren't on my side all along?

I know you're out there
I know you're gone
You can't say that's fair
Can't you be wrong?

I know you're out there
You're still a case, it's still the place
Were not you invited?
It is what you cannot spare
Whatever is left, just hide the rest
And bring it right in
I know it's sick
I know you think again it's just a trick
Maybe I've changed
Just tell me was this all in vain?

I know you're out there
I know that space is not a race
Were not you invited?
It is what you can't spare
Whatever is left, just hide the rest
And bring it right in
Maintained inside
I have lost my range
Feeling strange
Were not you invited?
Just never try
It is still the place
You're still the case
Now bring it right inEmbed
