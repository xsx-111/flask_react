Drawerings LyricsDo you know that it is alright?
I been thinking, see, and that is not how it is got to be
I am not saying if it is worth the fight
I am a space but you can count on me to save your place
And I know it is all to do with you and me
Do you know, if you are against the deal we will wait and see
But I would love to hear that story once again
It is the only part of me you still defend
Did you know I heard your voice?
When I call to see if you are around, I have no choice
Then the news is in my face
Took a step to let the feeling go and lost my place
And I swear I hear the same thing every night
Once again no accounting for the hours I spend
Baked as any time I drifted out of sight
Remember when you did not need this time to mend
Anywhere you would like to go
Would it help to be inside the life I could not know?
If you are shaking, it would not show
Hold out for me, because bailing at this point is really low
And I know it is all to do with just a friend
And I cannot decipher messages you send
But I would love to hear that story once again
It is the only part of me you still defendEmbed
