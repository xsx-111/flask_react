What Else Is New Lyrics
I'd like to see you
In the morning
In the evening
But you need a warning
I'd like to see you
It's a last ditch
Come on you got to
I ain't saying there's not a hitch
Well, come on out now
It's the only way
Can't think I know how
Is that all you're going to let me say?

I'd like to see you
Don't you miss it?
Lied again today
And now I wish that
You'd believe me when I need to
You should be weary; I would if I were you
Can I come along?
I can't take the strain
Now what else is wrong?
Sure, I'll take the blame
I'd like to see you
In the morning
In the evening
But you need a warning
I'd like to see you
Don't you miss it?
Lied again today now I wish that
You did believe me when I need to
You should be weary; I would if I were you
Can I come along? I can't take the strain
Now what else is wrong? Sure, I'll take the blame
Come on out now
It's the only way
Can't think I know how
Is that all you are going to let me say?
You got things to do
So, what else is new?
Won't you give me some?
Bring it back for me
Won't you come and see?
You are the only one
So, what else is new?
So, what else is new?
You got things to do
So, what else is new?
Won't you come and see?
Bring it back for me
Won't you come and see?
You are the only one
You are the only one
You are the only oneEmbed
