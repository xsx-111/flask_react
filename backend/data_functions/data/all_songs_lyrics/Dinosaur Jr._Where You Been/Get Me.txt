Get Me Lyrics
I don't see you, I won't call you
I don't know enough to stall you
Is it me, or is it all you?
Guess it's on and on
On a day, maybe I'd show you
But it's the least of all I go through
But the thing is I don't know you
And it is on and on

Trembling words don't make my eyes close
And if anyone, then you'd know
I can't find out 'cause you won't show
And it's on and on
Every dream is shot by daylight
And I pray that maybe you're right
But if you don't, maybe I might
'Cause it's on and on
When it takes too long I lose it
I'll just hang while you abuse it
If you knew then why'd you choose it
'Cause it's on and on
You're not gonna get me through this, are you?
You're not gonna get me through this, are you?
Anytime I'm there to show you
But if it takes too long I know you
Out the door just leaving me screwed
And it's on and on
Every time I try to fight it
It's so hard to seem excited
And if you don't try and bite it
Then it's on and on
You're not gonna get me through this, are you?
You're not gonna get me through this, are you?

I don't see you, I won't call you
I don't know enough to stall you
Is it me, or is it all you?
Yes, it's on and on
Every dream is shot by daylight
And I pray maybe that you're right
But if you don't maybe I might
'Cause it's on and onEmbed
