Falling Stars LyricsToo much love
I got too much love
As a vision slides
I got too much love
I got too much love
As a motion dies
You figure there's time
For a man to run
You figure there's time
For the falling stars come down on us
Run run run till you think you're made
Run run run till you're told you're safe
Run run run till you're overcome
Run run run you're the only one
I got too much love
Don't deceive me now
As the color slows
I got too much love
For a glitter doll
For the rainfall
You figure there's time
For a man to run
You figure there's time
For the falling stars come down on us
Run run run till you think you're made
Run run run till you're told you're safe
Run run run till you're overcome
Run run run you're the only one
Run run run till you think you're safe
Run run run till you're told you're made
Run run run till you're overcome
Run run run you're the only one
Don't step down
I got too much love
For the glitter doll
And my emotion slides
In another end
In another life
I was on your sideEmbed
