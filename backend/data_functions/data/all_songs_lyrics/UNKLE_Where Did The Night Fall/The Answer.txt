The Answer LyricsHere we are
Burning up in our cars
And in our hearts
Better days
Sleeping late with a headache
Perfect weather
Congregate
Lay in wait for an answer
They're still waiting
Grit your teeth
The lucky taste as the day breaks
The blind are leading the blind
Better
Better days without headaches
Perfect weather
Better
Better days without headaches
Perfect weather
Better
Better days without headaches
Perfect weather
Better
Better days without headaches
Perfect weather
Xenon lights
Dots go dashing the highways
Nothing's moving
Radiates
Everything lasting for seconds
Evaporated
Lovers' lips
Drinking late at the station
Smiling faces
Coming clean
Wiping your face in whatever
There's an answer
Better
Better days without headaches
Perfect weather
Better
Better days without headaches
Perfect weather
Better
Better days without headaches
Perfect weather
Better
Better days without headaches
Perfect weatherEmbed
