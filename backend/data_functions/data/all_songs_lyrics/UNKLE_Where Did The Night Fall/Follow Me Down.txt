Follow Me Down Lyrics
You're wondering if it's worth it
You're wondering what to do
You're asking me to see the future
And you want me to tell it to you
See I can't believe it myself
So how can I prove it to you
That this is all a dream

Okay follow me down
Come on you can trust me now
Okay follow me down
You can trust me now

Recurring thoughts of separation
Ones in which we are all alone
What keeps our heart from feeling wholeness
And everywhere we look we see ourselves
I'm not inclined to think in braided spirals
I know I wasn't always this way
What do I do and is it really worth it

Okay follow me down
Come on you can trust me now
Okay follow me down
You can trust me nowEmbed
