The Healing Lyrics
Battle scars and neon lights
She holds the flame
She owns the night
And she scars my soul
The road again
Strobe light highs
Paralyzed, anesthetized
And she sold my soul

And I'm healing, healing
Healing from the blows
Yeah I'm healing, healing
Healing from the blows
Yeah I'm healing
Healing from the blows

Neon smiles, narcotic light
The sulfur room
The hundreds nights
And she stole my soul
Cut of time, reckless bleed
Sedated smiles
Kick the need
And she steals my soul
And I'm healing, healing
Healing from the blows
Yeah I'm healing, healing
Healing from the blows
Yeah I'm healing
Healing from the blows
Healing from the blows
Healing from the blows

And I'm healing, healing
Healing from the blows
Yeah I'm healing, healing
Healing from the blows
Yeah I'm healing
Healing from the blows
Healing from the blows
Healing from the blowsEmbed
