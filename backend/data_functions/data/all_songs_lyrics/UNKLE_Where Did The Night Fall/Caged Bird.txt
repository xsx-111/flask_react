Caged Bird LyricsThe wind did blow
Across the valley
So we can run
Under illusion
This one dream
I see is true
The caged bird
Sings the blues
For you
This one dream
I see is true
The caged bird
Sings the blues
For you
I know where we can fly
Into, into thin air
Something to believe
Or beware
Into thin air
Something to believe
Or beware
Into thin air
Oh I know where we can fly
Hol-hol-hol-hold on on on on
Hol-hol-hol-hold on on on on
Oh someway
To break the cage
And route the rage to love
Love
Oh for so many nights
A prayer to breach that star
You'll reach tonight
Into, into thin air
Something to believe
Or beware
Into thin air
No light despair
Into thin air
Something to believe
Hol-hol-hol-hold on on on on
Hol-hol-hol-hold on on on on
It's all a dream
It seems to feel the air you breathe
There's so much needing
We are believing 
Hol-hol-hol-hold on on on on
Hol-hol-hol-hold on on on onEmbed
