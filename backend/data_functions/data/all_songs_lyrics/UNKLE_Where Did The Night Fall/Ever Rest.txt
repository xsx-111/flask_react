Ever Rest LyricsSmall part of me
The light by which I see
I'm not trying to break you down
I'm not trying to break you down
A single tear can be
Every part of me
One drop can wash me down
One drop can clear me out
Feign dignity
Come for miles to see
I'm not trying to break you down
I'm not trying to break you down
A single tear can mean
Everything to me
One drop can wash me down
One drop can clear me out
I'm holding to nothing
Repeat my destruction
Inside voices taunt me
Just holding to nothing
Repeat my destruction
Inside voices haunt me
We'll climb from the fire
This land won't tie meEmbed
