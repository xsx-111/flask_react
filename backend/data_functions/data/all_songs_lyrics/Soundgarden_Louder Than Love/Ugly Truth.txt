Ugly Truth Lyrics
You hide your eyes
But the ugly truth just loves to give it away
You gave yourself
If you were mine to give, I might throw it away

You share
But money can't give what the truth takes away
Throw it away

I painted my eyes
Ugly isn't what I want to see
I painted my mind
Ugly isn't what I want to be

I don't mind
But the truth don't look that good on me, yeah
Throw it away, throw it away

I don't think I really understand you
And I can't see why I'd ever want to
And even if it isn't mine to say
I'll say it anyway
It's ugly
It's ugly
It's ugly
You're not mine to give
You're not mine to give
You're not mine to give
You're not mine to give
It's ugly
If you were mine to give, I might throw it away
If you were mine to give, I might throw it away
If you were mine to give
I might throw it away
Yeah, but money can't give what the truth takes away
Throw it away
Throw it away
If you were mine to give
If you were mine to give
If you were mine to give
If you were mine to give, I might throw it away
If you were mine to give, I might throw it away
If you were mine to give, I might throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it awayEmbed
