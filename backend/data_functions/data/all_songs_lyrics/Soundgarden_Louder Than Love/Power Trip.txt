Power Trip Lyrics
I, I want to be a cowboy star upon the screen
And I, I want to drive my cowboy car across the screen
Oh hey and I, I want to write the magazines the housewives read
Oh and I, I want to be in control of everything
Oh, I want to be King, I want to be King
I, I want to make the toys you buy for Christmas Eve
I, I want to be the father of the ethnic child who stars on TV
I, I want to write the magazines the housewives read, yea read
Oh and I want all the leaders of the Third World to answer to me
I want to be King, yeah
I want to be King, yeah
So maybe now the Pope will bow and kiss my ring
I wanna be King
King
King
King
I said I want it
I need it
I wanna be King
I wanna be King
I wanna be King
Yes I do
I wanna be King
I wanna be King
I wanna be KingEmbed
