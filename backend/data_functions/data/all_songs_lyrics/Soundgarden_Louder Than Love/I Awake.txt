I Awake LyricsWoke up depressed
I left for work
You have a good day
It's not your fault
I know it hurts
Remember, I love you, love you
Remember, I love you, love you
I love
Woke up depressed
I left for work
You have a good day
It's not your fault
I know it hurts
Remember, I love you, love you
Remember, I love you, love you
I loveEmbed
