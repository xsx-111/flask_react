Hands All Over Lyrics
Ah...
Don't touch me!

Hands all over the eastern border
You know what, I think we're falling from composure
Hands all over western culture
Ruffling feathers, turning eagles into vultures
Yeah, into vultures

Got my arms around baby brother
Put your hands away, you're gonna kill your mother
Gonna kill your mother
Kill your mother
And I love her, yeah
I love her

Hands all over the coastal waters
The crew men thank her, then lay down their oily blanket
Hands all over the inland forest
In a striking motion, trees fall down like dying soldiers
Yeah, dying soldiers
Got my arms around baby brother
Put your hands away, you're gonna kill your mother
Gonna kill your mother
Kill your mother
And I love her, yeah
I love her
I love her

Hands all over the peasant's daughter
She's our bride, she'll never make it out alive
Hands all over words I utter
Change them into things you want to, like balls of clay
Put your hands away

Yeah, put your hands away
Put your hands away
Gonna kill your mother, gonna kill your mother
Gonna kill your mother
And I love her
And I love her
Yeah, I love her
I love her
And she loves me
Yeah
Yeah
Hey, hey, hey3Embed
