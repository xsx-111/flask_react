Get on the Snake Lyrics
Get on the snake with a swarm of motor flies
Get on the snake under the Cola-colored skies

Don't worry, everything's clean
Road-worthy, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean

Get on the snake where the metal river bleeds
Get on the snake where you never will believe

Hey baby, what's your disease?
My heart's bleeding, I'm dying to leave
Dying to leave
Yeah, dying to leave
Leave

Get on the snake where the water turns to steam
Get on the snake with a suicide machine

Don't worry, everything's clean
Road-worthy, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Yeah, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean
Hungry and mean1Embed
