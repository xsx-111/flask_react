Loud Love Lyrics
There's no time to keep it low
I've been deaf, now I want noise
You stay down, but I won't be quiet
I'll hammer on until you fight

Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Hammer on until you fight

If you've got some time to kill
Slow resistance wins the war
Well, I know, but that's no way to go
You can't resist the louder pull

Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Can't resist the louder pull, yeah
Well that's right
I want something to explode
I've been deaf
Now I want noise

Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud loveEmbed
