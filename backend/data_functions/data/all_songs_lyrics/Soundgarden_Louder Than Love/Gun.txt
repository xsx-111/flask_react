Gun Lyrics
Shoot, shoot

I got an idea of something we can do with a gun
Sink, load, and fire till the empire reaps what they've sown
Shoot, shoot, shoot till their minds are open
Shoot, shoot till their eyes are closed
Push, push, push till we get some motion
Push, push till the bombs explode
Yeah, yeah

I got an idea that we can do it all on our own
Nothing to worry, regret must weigh a ton
Kick, kick, kick till the laws are broken
Kick, kick till the boots are worn
Hit, hit, hit till the truth is spoken
Hit, hit till the truth is born
Yeah, born!
Fuck it up


Yeah
I got an idea of something we can do with a gun2Embed
