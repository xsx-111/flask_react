No Wrong No Right Lyrics
Watch for vipers and poison snakes
Healing fingers make no mistakes
Grabbing hands that pull your hair
Stealing everything that's there, everything

Restless widow in the dark
Carelessly looks for a spark
Near the trap, fate rears its head
No hesitation, victim dead

Just from the start, it's the end
And it's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end

Spider moving up your wall
To the ceiling, he slowly crawled
Weaves a web above your bed
Egg that cracks falls on your head

And it's all the same
It's all the same
No hesitation, victim dead
Just from the start, it's the end
It's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end, oh!

No wrong no right or guilt admission
It's all the same
You've been bitten
You've been bitten
You've been bittenEmbed
