My Heart is the Worst Kind of Weapon (Demo) Lyrics
I spent most of last night dragging this lake
For the corpses of all my past mistakes
Sell me out, the joke's on you, we are salt and you are
The wound
Empty another bottle and let me tear you to pieces
This is me wishing you into the worst situations
I'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go, but you
Wouldn't know a good thing if it came up and slit your throat

Whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa

Your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears, rather ones that just don't care
Cause I know that you're in between arms, somewhere
Next to heartbeats where you shouldn't dare sleep
Now, I'll teach you a lesson for keeping secrets from me

Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while
Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while
And did you hear the news? I could dissect you and
Gut you on this stage not as eloquent as I may have imagined
But it will get the job done, and you're
Done...
Every line is plotted and designed to leave you
Standing on your bedroom window's ledge
And everyone else that it hits, that it gets to
Is nothing more than collateral damage

Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while
Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while2Embed
