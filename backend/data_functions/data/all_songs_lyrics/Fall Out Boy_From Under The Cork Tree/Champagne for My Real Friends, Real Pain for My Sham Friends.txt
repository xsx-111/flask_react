Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends Lyrics
You are a getaway car
A rush of blood to the head
But me, I'm just the covers
On top of your bed
You steer away in a rear view mirror
Make my head swim
I keep you warm and won't ask you
Where you've been

With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and done, they're all scrambling
And we're friends, we're friends
Just because we move units

Strike us like matches 'cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame, such a shame

The sounds of this small town
Make my ears hurt (make my ears hurt)
"Oh yeah, you caught me!"
But I caught you one worse
They say, "You want a war? You've got a war!"
But who are you fighting for?
The tide's out, the ship's run aground
We drown traitors in shallow water
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and done, they're all scrambling
And we're friends, we're friends
Just because we move units

Strike us like matches 'cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame, such a shame

Everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame, such a shame
Strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame7Embed
