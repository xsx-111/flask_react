Ride On Josephine LyricsRide on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, child ya' got a runnin' machine
Baby baby ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Well now Josephine drivin' a hotrod Ford
She got twin carburators, gonna burn up the road
Twin exhausts kickin' out the rear
Some a'that'll really take away from here
Ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, child ya' got a runnin' machine
Baby baby ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Well now Josephine's engine, said it started run hot
She tried to trade it in down the used car lot
The man couldn't believe his natural eyes
When she pulled it up into his drive
Ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Ride on Josephine, girl ya' got a runnin' machine
Baby baby ride on Josephine, baby ride on
Josephine...your tank is leakin' baby
I think ya' better slow down, ride with me
Ya' say what?
Ya' ask me to hush up and mind my own business?
Uh...baby you are my business
You good business baby
I just looooove good business
Ya' say what?
Ya' ask me what kind of car am I drivin'?
Well, Uh...
I'm drivin' a '48 Cadillac with thunderbird wings
I'm tellin' ya' baby it's a runnin' thing
I could reach a groove a'baby .. get a gear
I think I could take it a'right outta here
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, ride on
Ride on Josephine, child ya' got a runnin' machine
Baby baby ride on Josephine, baby ride onEmbed
