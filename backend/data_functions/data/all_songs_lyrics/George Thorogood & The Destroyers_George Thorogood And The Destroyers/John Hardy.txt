John Hardy LyricsJohn Hardy oh he was a deperate little man
Carried a gun everyday
Well he shot down a man on a West Virginia line
And they seen John Hardy gettin' away, poor ole boy
Seen John Hardy gettin' away
But they cornered John Hardy on a tombstone bridge
Thought that he was free
But a deputy sheriff came and caught him by the arm
He said, Johnny come and go with me, poor ole boy
Come and go with me
John Hardy had a mother and a father too
Tryin to go his bail
But there was no bail out for the mother and man
They put ole John Hardy back in jail, poor ole boy
Throw John Hardy back in jail
John Hardy had a pretty little wife
The dress that she wore was blue
She ran through the jailhouse, she fell down on her knees
She said Johnny I been true to you, yes I have
Johnny I been true to you
John Hardy he stood inside his cell
The tears rollin from his eyes
I've been the death of many an honest man
Now I am going to die alone, now I am goin to die
Well I've been to the east, and I've been to the west
I've been this whole wide world round
I've been to the north, and I've been way down south
Now take me to my hangman's ground
Take me to my hangman's groundEmbed
