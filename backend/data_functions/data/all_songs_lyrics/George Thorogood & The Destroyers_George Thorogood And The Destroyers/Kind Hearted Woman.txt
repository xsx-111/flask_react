Kind Hearted Woman Lyrics
I got a kindhearted woman, do most anything in the world for me
She's a kindhearted woman, do most anything in the world for me
Oh, but these evil-hearted women, will not let me be

I love my baby, oh my baby don't love me
I love my baby, ooh, my baby don't love me
I really love that woman, can't stand to let her be

I said now Lord there ain't but the one thing, makes lonesome George drink
Got sad how you treat me, baby, I begin to think
Oh, baby, my life's all filled with pain
Mmm, swear 'bout how you treat me honey, when you call mister so-and-so's name

She's a kindhearted woman, but she study evil all the time
Mmm she's a kindhearted woman, she study evil all the time
She bound to kill me, as to have it off her mind

Someday, someday I will take your hand in mine
Someday, someday, babe I will take your hand in mine
I can't give you any more of my lovin' baby, 'cause I'm just not satisfiedEmbed
