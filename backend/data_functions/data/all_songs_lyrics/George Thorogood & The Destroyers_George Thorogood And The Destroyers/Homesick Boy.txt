Homesick Boy LyricsWell, I'm a homsick boy
Been away from home too long
I'm a homesick boy
Been away from home too long
Ever since I left, things been goin' down wrong
My guitar is my partner
And the highway is my friend
My guitar is my partner
And the highway is my friend
If I could make it back baby, this loneliness will end
I was a fool for leavin' but I guess this will be my fate
I was a fool for leavin' but I guess this will be my fate
You never know how good you've got it, til it's much too late
I like 90 proof whiskey, 14 carat gold
I like 90 proof whiskey, 14 carat gold
But I need a hunderd proof woman to satisfy my lonesome soul
Yes I do
I'm a homesick boy
Been away from home too long
I'm a homesick boy
Been away from home too long
Ever since I left, things been goin' down wrong
