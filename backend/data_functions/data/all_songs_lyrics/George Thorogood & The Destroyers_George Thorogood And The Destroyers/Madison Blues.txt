Madison Blues LyricsAh, you babes talk about your Madison shoes
We've got a thing we call the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues, baby
Rock away your blues
Whoa, yeah!
Well, I knew a gal her name is Lindsey-loo
She told me she loved me but I know it ain't true
Put on your Madison shoes
Put on your Madison blues shoes
I've got the Madison blues
Now put on your Madison blues shoes
Oh, yeah!
Now, you cats talkin' about your Madison shoes
We're doing a thing we call the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues, baby
Rock away your blues
Ah, you babes are talking about your Madison shoes
We've got a thing we call the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues
We do the Madison blues, baby
Rock away your bluesEmbed
