Got to Know the Woman Lyrics
I just met a woman on my way home, she just blew my mind
My heart was pumping, I mean all the way home
Got to know the woman
Whoa, I got to know the woman
I love the way you move
You make, make me feel like a man
(You know you make me, make me feel like a man)
Love the way you're looking
You look like you like it, too
(You know you look like you like it, too)

Got to know the woman
(Mama, mama, mama, mama, oom mow mow)

If you feel the feel I feel, you dig the feel of me
(You know you look like you dig feeling me)
Love the way you feel, dear
Ah, you make a, make a man out of me
(You make, you make a man out of me)
Come on, come on, come on and do the chicken

I mean
Baby, I'm going to tell you something right now
You got so much soul you blow my mind
Oh baby, there's just one thing I want to say
