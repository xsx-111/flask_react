Slip on Through Lyrics
Lots of people with no place to go
I know a place where you can go
You've got the ticket, come on slip inside
And let my song take you for a ride

Come on won't you let me be
By your side from now and eternity
Because I love you, baby I do

And now can't you see what has come over me
Oh, my life is growing like a big oak tree
Because I love you, baby I do
And now can't you see

Why don't you come and let me kiss and make it better
I'm not the one who come and left it later
Now you relax and let your mind go free
You won't regret the feeling you receive

Come on won't you let me be
By your side from now and eternity
'Cause I love you, baby I do
And now can't you see what has come over me
Oh, my life is growing like a big oak tree
'Cause I love you, baby I do
And now can't you see

My love is growing
Your heart is knowing
Our love is growing

Mama, oh can't you see
What has come over me
For my life
Oh, babyEmbed
