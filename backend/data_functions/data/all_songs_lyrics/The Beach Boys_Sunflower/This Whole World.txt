This Whole World Lyrics
I'm thinking about this whole world
Late at night I think about
The love of this whole world
Lots of different people everywhere
And when I go anywhere
I see love, I see love, I see love
When girls get mad at boys and go
Many times they're just putting on a show
But when they leave, you wait alone
You are there like everywhere
Like everyone you see
Happy, because you're living and you're free

Now, here comes another day for your love
(I'm thinking about this whole world)
(This whole world)
Love

Late at night I think about
The love of this whole worldEmbed
