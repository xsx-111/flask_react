Our Sweet Love Lyrics
I thought about a summer day
And how the time just floats away
Pretty things like incense and flowers
I want to make them part of

Our sweet love could last forever

I thought about a winter night
And how I'd like to hold you tight
Candlelight the warmth of a fire
We could make them part of


Sweet love, sweet love
Like a child with his new toy
My heart is filled with joy for


Lord knows I love her so
I feel it down inside my soul
A precious love like this can flower
There's nothing in this world like
