At My Window Lyrics
Birds fly up
And down spinning round
Flying all around
From my window
A little brown sparrow came
Fluttering down
"Le moineau est venu
Se poser à ma fenêtre"
He came to my window
And as I watched him
I found myself reeling and turning around
And the faster I ran
I ran out of breath and I fell to the ground
(Poof)

He came to my window

From their eyes
The people must look like miniature toys

Do do do do do
Fly awayEmbed
