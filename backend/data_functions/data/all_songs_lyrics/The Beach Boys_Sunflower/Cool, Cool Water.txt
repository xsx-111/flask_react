Cool, Cool Water Lyrics
Cooling, so cooling, cooling me

Have some cool clear water
(Drink a little drip, drip, drip, drip, drink a little)
(Water cooling me)


Water, water, water, water, water, water
Now, now, now, now, now



When the heat's got you down
Here's what you ought to
Get yourself in that cool, cool water
(Cooling so cool, cooling me)
Cool, cool water
Get yourself in that cool, cool water
(Cooling, so cool, cooling me)
Cool cool water
In an ocean or in a glass
Cool water is such a gas
Cooling, so cooling, cooling me
From the mountains on down to the sea
Cool water keeps on cooling me
When the nights are too hot to keep cool
I keep on dreaming about a swimming pool
When I'm just too hot to move
Cool, cool water is such a groove
In a shady spot when I'm laying down
Only thing moving are the ants on the ground

When I'm thirsty and I reach for a glass
Cool water tastes like such a gas
From the mountains on down to the sea
Cool, cool water keeps on cooling me
Get yourself in that cool, cool water now
Cool, cool water keeps on cooling meEmbed
