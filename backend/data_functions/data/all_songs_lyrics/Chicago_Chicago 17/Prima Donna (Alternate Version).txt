Prima Donna (Alternate Version) Lyrics
You've got the look they'll never forget
You wanna be noticed - but they haven't noticed yet
Oh oh whoa oh
When the time is right - a star on your door
Taking you places that you've never been before
Where did you go?
Oh oh whoa oh
Go to sleep tonight and dream about it til the morning
A feeling for the very first time

Go to sleep tonight and dream about it til the morning
A feeling for the very first time
On the screen tonight and when you wanna
They treat you like a Prima Donna (Prima Donna)

You're a movie queen - familiar face
Prettiest woman in the whole of the human race
Oh oh whoa oh
You're gonna be famous - you wanna go far
Name up in lights - everybody knows who you are
On with the show
Oh oh whoa oh
Make a scene tonight and dream about it til the morning
Appearing for the very first time
On the screen tonight and when you wanna
They treat you like a Prima Donna (Prima Donna)

How does it feel being number one? (How does it feel?)
Hard to imagine, but I can't blame you for trying
How does it feel having so much fun? (How does it feel?)
Hard to imagine but it's so electrifying
Oh whoa oh


How does it feel being number one? (How does it feel?)
Hard to imagine, but I can't blame you for trying
How does it feel having so much fun? (How does it feel?)
Hard to imagine but it's so electrifying
Oh whoa oh

Go to sleep tonight and dream about it til the morning
A feeling for the very first time
On the screen tonight and when you wanna
Treat you like a Prima Donna (Prima Donna)
Treat you like a Prima Donna (Prima Donna)
(Prima Donna)
(Prima Donna)
