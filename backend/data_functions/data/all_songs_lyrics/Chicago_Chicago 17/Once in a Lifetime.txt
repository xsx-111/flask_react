Once in a Lifetime Lyrics
When I saw your face
I could feel my heartbeat begin to race
In the still of the night
It was love at first sight
Not too long ago
I was on my own
Never would have known
You'd come into my life
Now, you're the love of my life

Once in a lifetime
Maybe the last time
Just the right time to fall in love
Once in a lifetime
For such a long time
I've been waiting for you

You were there for me
I was there for you
We were meant to be
Now we're falling in love
Finally falling in love

Oh no

Once in a lifetime
Maybe the last time
Just the right time to fall in love
Once in a lifetime
For such a long time
I've been waiting for you
Once in a lifetime
Maybe the last time
Just the right time to fall in love
Once in a lifetime
For such a long time
I've been waiting for you
Once in a lifetime
Maybe the last time
Just the right time to fall in love
Once in a lifetime
For such a long time
I've been waiting for you

Once in a lifetime...Embed
