Stay the Night Lyrics
I don't want you to misunderstand me
I just wan to say what's on my mind
No need to hit me with an attitude
Because I haven't got the time
I want you to know one thing's for certain
I surely love your company
And I won't take no if that's your answer
At least that's my philosophy

Stay the night
There's room enough here for two
Stay the night
I'd like to spend it with you
Stay the night
Why don't we call it a day
No one can stop us, nothing is in the way

Have some friendly conversation
And if you still don't have a clue
Unless there's something else you've got in mind
We've got better things to do

Stay the night
There's room enough here for two
Stay the night
I'd like to spend it with you
Stay the night
Why don't we call it a day
No one can stop us, nothing is in the way
Just to have you near me
Here by my side
Just to have you near
And when I get next to your body
Just to have you near me
One thing I can tell you, perfectly clear
We're gonna have a very good time

Stay the night
There's room enough here for two
Stay the night
I'd like to spend it with you
Stay the night
Why don't we call it a day
No one can stop us, nothing is in the wayEmbed
