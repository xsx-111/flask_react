Here is Where We Begin Lyrics
Most of my life
I was living without you...
Something always seemed so incomplete
Through the years
I was thinking about you...
Waiting for the moment we would meet

How do you do?
Good to see you!
What are your thoughts?
Did you need to...
Had so long 'til the feeling...
Something was wrong...

(There are no) Here is where we begin
Its all very clear...
For this is the end
Of being alone
We've waited so long...
We'll make it forever

Nights I would dream
Of the day we made contact
Its come true
Now I'm standing at your door
After a time did you come to forget me?
Here I am
Now I'm standing at your door
How do you do?
Good to see you!
What are your thoughts?
Did you need to...
Had so long 'til the feeling...
Something was wrong...

(There are no) Here is where we begin
Its all very clear...
For this is the end
Of being alone
We've waited so long...
We'll make it forever
(There are no) Here is where we begin
Its all very clear...
For this is the end
Of being alone
We've waited so long...
We'll make it forever
(There are no) Here is where we begin
Its all very clear...
For this is the end
Of being alone
We've waited so long...
We'll make it forever
(there are no) Here (Oh here is where we begin) is where we begin
(It's all so clear) Its all very clear...
(This is the end) For this is the end
Of being alone
We've waited so long..Embed
