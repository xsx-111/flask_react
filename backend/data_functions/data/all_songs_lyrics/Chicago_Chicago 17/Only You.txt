Only You Lyrics
Hold me forever
Whisper the words I've waited so long to hear
Love's sweet surrender
Steals an embrace and kisses away the tears
Looking back down the road of love
We can still feel the heartache
Pain and joy of an unrelenting love
Hold us together

Only you (Only you have)
You've got control
Only you (Only you have)
You've got the key to my heart
Only you (Only you have)
You've got control
Need your love, take me forever

Sad empty faces
Faded away when I fell in love with you
True love erases
Fear and the doubt not knowing
We'd see things through
So in love, unaware of time
In a world of illusion
We fell in love until the end of time
True love, forever
Only you (Only you have)
You've got control
Only you (Only you have)
You've got the key to my heart
Only you (Only you have)
You've got control
Need your love, take me forever

Looking back, down the road of love
We can still feel the heartache
Pain and joy of an unrelenting love
Hold us together

Only you (Only you have)
You've got control
Only you (Only you have)
You've got the key to my heart
Only you (Only you have)
You've got control
Need your love, take me forever
Only you (Only you have)
You've got control
Only you (Only you have)
You've got the key to my heart
Only you (Only you have)
You've got control
Need your love, (I need it)
Take me foreverEmbed
