Remember the Feeling Lyrics
Shadows were hiding what I couldn't see
Out in the dark - she was calling to me
Calling to me with a voice I'd never forget
She was a vision I couldn't believe
I held her close so that she wouldn't leave
Suddenly helpless - hopelessly falling in love

I remember the feeling
I remember the way
She came up and wrapped her arms around me
Told me that she cared
Said she'd always be there

Taking me places that I've never been
She had the beauty that comes from within
Was I just dreaming?
Was it too good to be true
I was a man all alone in the night
She came along and she showed me the light
I was confused then she told me the way
I was alone and I begged her to stay

She was alive I was caught by the fire
She brought emotions that filled my desire
I should have noticed that something was wrong
When I awoke, she was gone
I remember the feeling
I remember the way
She came up and wrapped her arms around me
Told me that she cared
Said she'd always be there

She was alive I was caught by the fire
She brought emotions that filled my desire
I should have noticed that something was wrong
When I awoke, she was goneEmbed
