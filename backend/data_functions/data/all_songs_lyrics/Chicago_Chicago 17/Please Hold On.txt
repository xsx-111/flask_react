Please Hold On Lyrics
Do you love me?
Do you need me?
Tell the truth tonight
Do you love me?
Do you need me?
Can I still call you mine?
I've heard the same old story
So many times
For every lie that you've told me
I'd be a rich man if I had a dime
Why do you take me?
Why do you rake me?
Over your red hot coals
Why do you scold me?
After you hold me
Why do you turn so cold?
The lady's constant cruising
Explains the tears
The lonely path she's choosing
If I didn't love her would I still be here

Please hold on, stay with me
Tell me what you have in mind
Please hold on, stay with me
Baby, don't you leave me behind
Do you love me?
Do you need me?
Tell me the truth this time
Do you love me?
Do you need me?
Can I still call you mine?
Soft lights and quiet music
Forgets your name
Some people try to use it
But loneliness chooses the rules to the game

Please hold on, stay with me
Tell me what you have in mind
Please hold on, stay with me
Baby, don't you leave me behind
Please hold on, stay with me
Tell me what you have in mind
Please hold on, stay with me
Baby, don't you leave me behindEmbed
