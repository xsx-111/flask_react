Along Comes a Woman Lyrics
There is a time when a man needs someone to talk to
Someone to talk to, somebody who'll always be there
All alone, nothing seemed to matter
So alone, doesn't get much better
Can't explain something that you're feeling
For the very first time

There was a time when you needed someone to hold on to
Someone to hold you, somebody who's always sincere
All alone, suddenly you see her
So alone, you know you're gonna need her
Can't explain something that you're feeling
For the very first time

Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right

There was a time when you needed someone to count on
You needed someone to count on
Someone to care
Now she's here, nothing seems to matter
She's so near, everything is better
Can't explain, something that you're feeling
For the very first time
Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right
Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the air that you're breathing tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right


Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's right
Then along comes a woman
There's a change in the air that you're breathing tonight
Then along comes a woman
And you know that it's rightEmbed
