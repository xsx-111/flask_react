Ooohhh Baby Lyrics
You're the kind of girl that everybody's warned me about
You're the kind of person that everybody's here staring at
But now you are a topless dancer working out of a bar on Times Square
And everybody wishes you were back in the massage parlor back there
Only baby knew, you make me go

Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby
Ooh ooh ooh

Your old man was the best B&E man down on the streets
And all the guys on the precinct
Always was watching for him on their beat
But when he ripped off Seymour he was really not a doing so fine
And everything is knots
Well except his hands and legs and maybe even mine
He see they just make them strip off, they say

Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh
Ooh baby ooh
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh
Hey, baby, ooh ooh ooh
It's very funny asking me why they keep the lights on down so low
Well, yesterday's chase today is competition
Or didn't you know
And all fluorescent lighting make so your wrinkles they don't show
And it's very funny the way that 20 bucks an hour can-uh go
If you don't make me go, now, now, now

Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh
Ooh baby ooh
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh
Baby, ooh ooh ooh

Everybody wondered 'bout you when you were seen
In drinking some beer
You got here from Ohio and your mother said
You'd hooked her in the real near
That's the way it goes now

Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh
Baby ooh ooh ooh
Hey, shake your bones now, mama
Ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh
Bay, ooh baby ooh
Walk it now
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh) Get down
(Oohh baby, ooh baby, ooh baby, ooh)
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh)
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh)
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh)
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh)
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh)
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh)
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh)
(Oohh baby, ooh, ooh baby, ooh)Embed
