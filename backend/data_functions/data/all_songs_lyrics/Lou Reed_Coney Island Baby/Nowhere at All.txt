Nowhere at All Lyrics
Somebody's got to help me
This girl's drivin' me insane
'Cause some they likes it hot, and some they likes it cold
And some they just don't like it at, like it at all now

Somebody's got to help me
This girl's drivin' me insane
Now somebody she's got to help me
It makes me feel like, ah, that I'm nowhere at all
It makes me feel like I'm nowhere at all

Somebody's got to help me
This girl's got me on the line now
'Cause some they likes it hot, and some they likes it cold
And some they just don't like it at, like it at all now

Somebody's got to help me
This girl's drivin' me insane
Somebody's got to help me
She's making me feel like, I'm nowhere at all
It makes me feel like I'm nowhere at all
I'm nowhere at all
I'm nowhere at all, give it to me now
I'm nowhere at all now
No honey, Rocky don't know it at all
I'm no, no, nowhere at all
I'm nowhere at all now
Oh, give it to me nowEmbed
