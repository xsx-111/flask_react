Coney Island Baby Lyrics
You know, man, when I was a young man in high school
You believe it or not, I wanted to play football for the coach
And all those older guys
They said that he was mean and cruel, but you know
Wanted to play football for the coach
They said I was a little too light weight to play linebacker
So's I'm playing right end
Wanted to play football for the coach
'Cause, you know some day, man
You gotta stand up straight unless you're gonna fall
Then you're going to die
And the straightest dude
I ever knew was standing right for me all the time
So I had to play football for the coach
And I wanted to play football for the coach

When you're all alone and lonely in your midnight hour
And you find that your soul has been up for sale
And you begin to think about a-a-all the things that you've done
And you begin to hate just about everything
But remember the princess who lived on the hill
Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
And right now she just might come shining through
And the glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love just might come through

And all your two-bit friends have gone and ripped you off
They're talking behind your back saying, man
You ain't never going to be no human being
And you start thinking again
About all those things that you've done
And who it was and what it was
And all the different things you made every different scene
Ah, but remember that the city is a funny place
Something like a circus or a sewer
And just remember different people have peculiar tastes

And the glory of love
The glory of love
The glory of love might see you through
Yeah, but now, now
Glory of love
The glory of love
The glory of love might see you through
Glory of love, ah huh huh
The glory of love
Glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love, now, glory of love, now
Glory of love, now, now, now, glory of love
Glory of love, give it to me now
Glory of love'll see you through
Oh, my Coney Island baby, now
(I'm a Coney Island baby, now)
I'd like to send this one out to Lou and Rachel
And all the kids and P.S. 192
Coney Island baby
Man, I'd swear, I'd give the whole thing up for youEmbed
