Leave Me Alone (Coney Island Baby outtake) Lyrics
All the kinds of people tryin' to tell you what to do now
But they just gotta scam em', they're just tryin' to see through you
Rip off cities where they are comin' from
And they can make it so your music isn't much fun now

Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone

Loreen had a face that couldn't ever replace
And after the operation she lost her taste
The last time that I saw her was by CC&Y
She was going without you and she knew why
Business, man

Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone, uh huh
Hey leave me alone man

I wish that you'd get your little Jap kid out of town
Send it to a school where the wasps don't frown
I don't think that I like all the things that you do
I don't want to get ethnic but I know that you're through
I said now leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Hey baby, baby, baby, baby, leave me alone
Get down now
Hey lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely boy
Hey lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely boy now
Get to it now
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Hey baby now
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone

Take it to it for me baby
Leave me now alone
Hey leave me now alone
Hey get out of town now
Hey baby leave it alone
Hey no no, no no, no where you goin' now
Leave me now-now-now, now-now-now, now now
Huh huh huh
Yeah give it to me now
Hey pick it up and go now
Hey pick it up and go now
Hey leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it alone now
Now give it, do it to me now now now
Get to it, uh huh
Bet you got to get high to appreciate it right now
Hey leave me now alone
Hey give it to me now
Hey  it mother fucker now
Hey say it mother fucker now
Hey leave me now alone
Hey leave me now alone
Hey Jap
So say yay yay yay yeahEmbed
