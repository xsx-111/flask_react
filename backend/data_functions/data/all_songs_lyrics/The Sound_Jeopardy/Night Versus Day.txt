Night Versus Day LyricsFrom the dark hill the huddled homes
Shine like sequins and sapphires
Families each sealed inside
The frail fortress peace of mind requires
A switch is snapped, and the borderline
Between night and day is gone
Between shifting sea and firm ground
Between savage and civilisation
Sleep guides unseen
Into new territory every night
Abandons us to what we keep
Enslaved within the hours of light1Embed
