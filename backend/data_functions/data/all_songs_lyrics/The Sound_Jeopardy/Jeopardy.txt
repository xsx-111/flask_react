Jeopardy LyricsWe are young
But are we strong?
We've held out
For so long
Now we're in
Jeopardy
Now we're in
Jeopardy, jeopardy
We knew our
Ideals were high
The lower we sink
The less we care why
I know we're in
Jeopardy
I know we're in
Jeopardy, jeopardy
Lost the will
To keep up the pace
Dead on my feet
Defeat on my face
I know I'm in
Jeopardy
I know I'm in
Jeopardy, jeopardy
Jeopardy, jeopardy
Such a slow
Steady slide
Takes away
So much inside
And what's left?
Jeopardy
What's left?
Jeopardy, jeopardy
Jeopardy, jeopardy
I'm in jeopardy, jeopardy1Embed
