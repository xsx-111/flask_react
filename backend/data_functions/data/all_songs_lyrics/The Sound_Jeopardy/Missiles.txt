Missiles LyricsDeep in the country
The factories hide
Where they make the missiles
That run our lives
Who the hell makes those missiles?
Who the hell makes those missiles?
Who the hell makes those missiles?
When they know what they can do
They've got the money
They've got the know-how
It's all above our heads
It's coming down now
Who the hell makes those missiles?
Who the hell makes those missiles? Missiles
Who the hell makes those missiles?
When they know what they can do
Missiles cause damage
And make an eerie sound
Missiles leave carnage
Where there once was a town
Who the hell makes those missiles?
Who the hell makes those missiles? Missiles
Who the hell makes those missiles?
When they know what they can do
Who the hell makes them?
Who the hell makes them?
Who the hell makes those missiles?
When they know what they can do?Embed
