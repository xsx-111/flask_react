Words Fail Me LyricsMy need gnaws at me
My need claws at me
My need lurks inside
It won't be pacified
To say what must be said
And nothing else instead
To reach and grope no more
To grab the core
Words fall, words fall short
When I try to reach the gulf
They fall short
Words fail, words fail me
Trying to speak from the heart
Of my heart
My need gnaws at me
My need claws at me
My need lurks inside
It won't be pacified
To say what must be said
And nothing else instead
To reach and grope no more
To grab the core
Words fall, words fall short
When I try to reach the gulf
They fall short
Words fail, words fail me
Trying to speak from the heart
Of my heart
Information
Recitation
Communication
That's the complication
Words fall, words fall short
When I try to reach the gulf
They fall short
Words fail, words fail me
Trying to speak from the heart
Of my heart
Words fall, words they fall short, fall short
When I try to reach the gulf
They fall short
Words fail, words fail me
Trying to speak from the heart
Of my heart, heart, heart, heart1Embed
