Hour of Need LyricsI hate the quiet times
I need some company
I miss the noise of life
The silence deafens me
The seconds split so slow
The minutes I can't kill
I keep an eye on the time
I catch it standing still
In my hour of need
In my hour of need
Try to find my place
Sometimes I get so near
I journey aimless days
But always end up here
In my hour of need
In my hour of need
In my hour of need
In my hour of need1Embed
