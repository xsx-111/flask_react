Heartland LyricsSetting out
City in your sights
You want an overview of the underground
The pressure's off
So your feelings rise, you gotta hit that peak
Before you crash back down
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe in a heartland
In a heartland
All mixed up
In the heartland heat
A chemistry of commotion and style
You're thrown in
You've got to lose yourself before you find yourself
Back in exile
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe in a heartland
In a heartland
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe in a heartland
In a heartland
In a heartland
I said you gotta believe
In a heartlandEmbed
