Resistance LyricsCaught in the comfort of my trap
Where it's easier to die than to fight back
Half-dead, but I hope it's not too late
To take some action and change my fate
Hold on
Hold out
Resistance
Lost in the white-out, I'm under the snow
The more I struggle, the further down I go, down I go
Half-dead, but I hope it's not too late
To take some action and change my fate
Hold on
Hold out
Resistance
Resistance
Resistance
Resist! Resist!
Resist! Resist!
Resist! Resist!
Resist! Resist! (Resistance)
