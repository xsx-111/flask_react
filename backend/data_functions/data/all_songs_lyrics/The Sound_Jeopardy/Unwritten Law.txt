Unwritten Law LyricsWe stab at our faith to keep it alive
We draw the blood but the law draws the line
A hand is a hand, a knife is a knife
Blood is blood, and life is life
We could go anywhere
It would still be the same
A change of climate, a change of air
All the pressure would remain
I can read the unwritten law
I can read the unwritten law
A hand is a hand, a knife is a knife
Blood is blood, life is life
A hand is a hand, a knife is a knife
Blood is blood, and life is life
The unwritten law
The unwritten law1Embed
