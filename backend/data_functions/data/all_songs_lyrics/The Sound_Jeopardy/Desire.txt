Desire LyricsIn the dark, near the heart
Close to real desire
In my words, in my eyes
Can't you feel the desire?
We will wait for the night
We will wait for desire
Bittersweet, laugh and cry
Tears that taste of desire
Hunted down, through the days
Caught in nets of desire
Feel the loss as it fades
Can't forget desire
Keep in touch, keep in track
Of this thing called desire
There'll be times when we'll do
Anything for desire
Hunted down, through the days
Caught in nets of desire
Feel the loss as it fades
Can't forget desire
Keep in touch, keep in track
Keep within the reach of desire
There'll be times when we'll do
Anything for desire
We will wait for the night
We will wait
We will wait for the night
We will wait
We will wait for the night
We will wait
We will wait for the night
We will waitEmbed
