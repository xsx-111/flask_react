Heyday LyricsYou're so young to be confused
Well, I know that's the time it starts
All the conflict seems to fuse
Leaving you in the dark
Find yourself all at sea
Never thought they'd let you drown
You were trying to find your feet
Can't believe they'd cut you down
Can't believe they'd cut you down
In your heyday, heyday
In your heyday, heyday
You've been pressured into the hard sell
A victim of a nation's scheming
As the expectations swell
You retreat inside your dreaming
Find yourself all at sea
Never thought they'd let you drown
You were trying to find your feet
Can't believe they'd cut you down
Can't believe they'd cut you down
In your heyday, heyday
In your heyday, heyday
In your heyday, heyday
In your heyday, heyday
Heyday
Heyday
Heyday
