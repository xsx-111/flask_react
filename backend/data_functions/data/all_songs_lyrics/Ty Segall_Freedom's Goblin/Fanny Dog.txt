Fanny Dog Lyrics
Fanny knows what her name is
She knows just how to come
Fanny knows what her name is
She knows just who will call

Fanny knows what the game is
She knows just how to play
Fanny knows what the game is
She knows just who will stay

So keep it under, undercover
My Fanny goes on down
Keep it under, undercoverâ€‹
My Fanny sticks around

She knows how to grab hold
Fanny runs you around
My Fanny, she won't let go
She loves you till you're down

So keep it under, undercover
My Fanny goes on down
Keep it under, undercover
My Fanny sticks around
Yeah!Embed
