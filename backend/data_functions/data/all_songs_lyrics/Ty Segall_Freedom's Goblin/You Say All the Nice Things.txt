You Say All the Nice Things Lyrics
You say all the nice things
That I want to hear
And when you lay me down
Those whispers disappear

Do you really want to be, be with me?
And do you want me to stay with you?
Do you really want to be, be with me?
And do you want me to stay with you?

So, I just want to know
What you want to do
I don't want to go
But I will if you want me to

Do you really want to be, be with me?
And do you want me to stay with you?
Do you really want to be, be with me?
And do you want me to stay with you?

You say all the nice thingsEmbed
