Every 1's a Winner Lyrics
Never could believe the things you do to me
Never could believe the way you are
Every day I bless the day that you got through to me
'Cause baby, I believe that you're a star

Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (that's the truth)
Making love to you is such a thrill
Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (that's no lie)
You'll never fail to satisfy (satisfy)

Never could explain just what was happening to me
Just one touch of you and I'm a flame
Baby, it's amazing just how wonderful it is
That the things we like to do are just the same

Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth (that's the truth)
Making love to you is such a thrill
Everyone's a winner, baby, that's no lie (that's no lie)
You never fail to satisfy (satisfy)Embed
