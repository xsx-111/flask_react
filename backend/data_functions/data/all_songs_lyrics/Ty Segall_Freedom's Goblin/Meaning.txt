Meaning Lyrics
I see fear in freedom
I see judgement in your eyes
And when you say you know
I say, "No!"

You're serious
You're filled with meaning
You're filled with meaning
You're filled with shit!
Okay
Okay

You're serious
You're filled with meaning
You're filled with meaning
You're filled with shit!Embed
