Shoot You Up Lyrics
See the children walking the streets
Looking for that nice piece of meat
When you walk into the neighborhood
They're gonna treat you like you're no good

They're gonna shoot you up
They're gonna shoot you up
They're gonna eat you up
They're gonna eat you up

Yeah these children, they ain't children no more
They are the carnivores
They're gonna treat you like a piece of meat
They're just looking for something to eat

They're gonna eat you up
They're gonna eat you up
They're gonna shoot you up
They're gonna shoot you up

(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)
(Shoot you up)Embed
