And, Goodnight Lyrics
Oh sleeper, my dreamer
I dream a dream for you
My dreamer, my sleeper
My dream's dream come true
I dream sweet love, a dream for you
From your baby boy blue
I dream sweet love, a dream for you
From your baby boy blue
And I wanna sleep all day
And I wanna go away
Okay, I want to sleep all day with you

Fall deeper, fall deeper
Into sleep, my dreamer do
And I will be there with my sleeper
Dreaming beneath the moon
I dream sweet love, a dream for you
From your baby boy blue
I dream sweet love, a dream for you
From your baby boy blue
