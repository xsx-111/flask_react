Talkin 3 LyricsI heard you talking about your friends
You said you don't love none of them
I heard you screaming about your friends
You said you don't like none of them
I think you're talking about yourself
Yeah!
I heard you screaming about Sammy Cross
You say you don't like a big mouth
I heard you're jealous about Phillip Jean
You say you don't like 
I think you're talking about yourself
Yeah!
Talking about yourself
About yourselfEmbed
