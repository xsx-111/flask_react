Rain Lyrics
I'm sick of the sunshine
I wish I could make it blue for you
Instead it blooms
Instead it blooms

My heart is filled with dust
And all I see is light
And I still wait for the sun to grow cold and still
Still I wait for you

'Cause you, you can make the rain
Oh you, you can make the rain
And oh you, you can make the rain
And you can make the rain

I'm waiting for the sky to die

Oh you, you can make the rain
Oh you, you can make the rain
And oh you, you can make the rain
And you can make the rain
Oh
I'm sick of the sunshine
I wish I could make it blue for you
Instead it blooms
Instead it bloomsEmbed
