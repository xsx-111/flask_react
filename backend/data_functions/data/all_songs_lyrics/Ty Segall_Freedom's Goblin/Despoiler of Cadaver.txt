Despoiler of Cadaver Lyrics
Hush, he said to me
"Hey, come here, come closer"
I want to whisper in your ear
And give you everything

He shoots
Despoiler of cadaver
He shoot, shoots
The despoiler of cadaver

Now I'm dead
Bullet in the head
But I'll pick up my aching bones
I'm gonna find him

So I can shoot
The despoiler of cadaver
So I can shoot, shoot
The despoiler of cadaver
Shoot
The despoiler of cadaver
I'll shoot, shoot
The despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaver
Despoiler of cadaverEmbed
