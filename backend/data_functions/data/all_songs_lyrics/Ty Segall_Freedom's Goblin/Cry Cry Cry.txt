Cry Cry Cry Lyrics
You said it's over, baby
I watched you cry
You said you found someone
Enough to try, oh

You said you wanted out
But you changed your mind
And now you're crying tears
That have made you blind

So don't you take my brother away
So don't you take my brother away

You say it's true love
Like those angels from above
But those tears fall from all high
You'll just go ahead and cry

I know you feel sorry
But you need to know
That I don't want to hurt you
So I let you go, oh
You said you wanted out
But you changed your mind
And now you're crying tears
That have made you blind

So don't you take my brother away
So don't you take my brother away

You say it's true love
Like those angels from above
But those tears fall from all high
So you go ahead and cry, cry

(Cry)
Cry (Cry, cry)
Cry (Cry, cry)
Cry
Cry (Cry, cry)
Cry (Cry, cry)
Cry (Cry, cry)
Cry
Cry (Cry, cry)
Cry (Cry, cry)
Cry (Cry, cry)
