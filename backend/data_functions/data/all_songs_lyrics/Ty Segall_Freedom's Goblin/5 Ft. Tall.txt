5 Ft. Tall LyricsYou see me coming
Coming back, coming home
Well, that can't be me
'Cause I heard you're all alone
Not coming back
To your arms now
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming home
You said you're sorry for the things that you've done
You said you love me and you're done being on the run
But you know you have said this to me before
And when I defended you, you still walked right out the door
Not coming back
To you arms now
I'm not coming back
I'm not coming home
I can still remember, you are five-foot tall
And when I looked up at you, I felt very small
I thought you were just what I want to be
And I don't need your picture hanging on my wall
'Cause if I hung it up, I'm sure that it would fall
I thought you were just what I want to be
And I don't need your picture hanging on my wall
I remember you just fine, you're five-foot tall
Tall, tall, tall, yeahEmbed
