The Last Waltz LyricsNo more pain, no more love
My baby left for the world up above
And no one saw her when she died
My baby died with no tears in her eyes
(Oh/Yes), baby, baby, where will (I/you) go?
The bombs came down and destroyed my home
Oh, baby, baby, now that you're gone
I'm sorry dear, I cannot go on
And I take myself to the place where we fell
In love those nights before there was hell
I did not know how free we were
Until you left in a ball of sulfur
And like a man institutionalized
I cannot live, so now I must die
And the only way to see you again
Is for my life to come to an end
Yes, I remember now, my wedding wine
I'll drink some now, stop wasting my time
Just a couple more will do the trick
More, more, yes that's it
Yes and soon, soon, I'll be with you soon
Oh soon, soon, I'll be with you soon
Yes and soon, soon, I'll be with you soon
Soon, soon, I'll be with you soon
Yes and soon, soon, I'll be with you soon
Soon, soon, I'll be with you soon
Yes and soon, soon, I'll be with you soon
Soon, soon, I'll be with you soonEmbed
