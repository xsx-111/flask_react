When Mommy Kills You Lyrics
When mommy tries to (kill you)
What are you to (to do)?
Climb under the sheets and dream of future days
When you can be away and be free

When mommy tries to (kill you)
What are you to (to do)
Grab her hand, tell her she is the only one
That we can have such fun, just wait and see

I don't wanna wait up for Ma
She's gone to bed with a different Pa
I'm not sleepy, just you wait and see

When mommy tries to (kill you)
What are you to (to do)?
Climb under the sheets and dream of future days
When you can be away and be free

I don't wanna wait up for Ma
She's gone to bed with a different Pa
I'm not sleepy, just you wait and see
Merrily, merrily, merrily
We all fall downEmbed
