The Main Pretender Lyrics
You got your money (yeah)
You got your home
You keep on saying that you feel so all alone
You got your body (yeah)
You got your tears
You keep on saying that I owe you all my years

(Your life as the actor)
Surrender (yeah)
(You lie in the mirror)
Surrender (yeah)

You're no one's baby
You're no one's lover
You're no one's brother
You're the main pretender


(Your life as the actor)
Surrender (yeah)
(You lie in the mirror)
Surrender (yeah)
You're no one's baby
You're no one's lover
You're no one's mother
You're the main pretender

The main pretender
The main pretender
The main pretender
The main pretender
