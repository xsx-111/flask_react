Silent Treatment Lyrics
Girl, you know that you need to stop
Givin' me the silent.. treatment, baby
Can't you see what you mean to me?
I wanna love you constantly
But you keep neglectin' me, and treatin' me silently

Yo, I had a queen named Amina, height 5'7"
Caramel-complected, body like heaven
Met her through the sister of my man Big Vince
Like somethin' from out the flicks, we been in love ever since
She called me her chocolate brother, I call her my sugar sister
Knew Shorty could work it since before I ever kissed her
I never dissed her, painted my picture to hit
But because sex she wasn't with, she started flippin' and shit
Like, "Listen, man, I'm Queen Amina, Amina's not no freak and
That game is weak and keep tryin' to hit I could quit speakin'
Tariq, in fact, you bein' Black Thought don't get you closer
I dig ya but won't bone ya because I'm so-called supposed to
Most o' them would, but that couldn't be me, that's not my flavor
Go home and think about that, maybe later on I'll page ya"
I contemplated, and then concluded she was bluffin'
Steady pursuin' screwin', gettin' nothin' but the silent treatment

Crazy frustration, about my lovin' situation
Where patience was a virtue, but I wasn't used to waitin'
I want some Marvin Gaye healin', feelin' is real inside
I slip and slide, my ride'll keep you occupied
I'd love to get with it like that
But my baby's kitty cat's capped and locked
Love Boat is docked at the shore
And what for? Later for groupies on tour
Why won't my sugar call me no more?
I mean, my queen gets upset, rejectin' and sexually neglectin'
Sayin' I'm more sewer than Das EFX, and closed-minded
It's like I'm blinded by the skin and, I'm into women
Because of that, this one's endin' communication
Temptation played the vandal
Freakin' my brain, my mind
Grippin' the handle on physically scandalous acts
Yo, she knew what I wanted, but she fronted
Bust it


Well, umm
Movin' right along with the song, plus the strong
Feelings on my mind, desire to intertwine, combine and blend
Baby, bust the message that I send
Ain't no need to pretend, 'cause shit is real 'til the end
I provide a place to hide from crime, hard times and livin' trife
While I open your mind, you're in my life like love
It ain't no way no one can rise above what's real
That's why I'm feelin' like you're makin' me bugged
I puff an L on fifty deuce while I walk in the rain
Heart feelin' killer pain while I hop the train
Dial her number to the rest, and ain't no messages left
Regardless, my chest thumps from stress, yo, it's a mess
I don't know what I gotta do to make you understand
I'm for real and that's no question, no frontin' or no guessin'
Undressin', caressin' in the span, that I contain in my hand
Could touch and make you say that I'm such a man
And call my name, so let me set your body aflame
I'll never treat you like a dame or run game
Now, who's to blame?
I know you're not a hoe for niggas with a lot of dough
But I just wanted you to know
