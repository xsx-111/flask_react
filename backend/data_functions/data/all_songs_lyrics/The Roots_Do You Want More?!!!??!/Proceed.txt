Proceed Lyrics
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)

Just think, what if you could just
Just blink yourself away?
Just think, what if you could just
Just blink yourself away?
Jeff X can rock the mic with tooth decay
I be the 5 foot 7
Residin' at the Mecca rest address in South section
Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass back in '86
Easy with the chicks, I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walked the mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
'Til the train stopped, then a nigga hopped (Hopped)
Used to do the pop dance to the Planet Rock
At the block party, everybody jocked, "Who, me?!"
It's the MC sucka niggas envy
I got my contract in 1993, and I shall proceed
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)

I wake up early in the mornin', I mean early afternoon
Break a lyrical hymn of the stim' like boom
I'm fly and when I die, yo, put this shit up on my tomb
That nigga represented on the 28th of June
I'm representin' Philly on the 28th of June
I can make you feel that I'm a surreal cartoon
With my pistol in the face of Hip-Hop, stickin' for papes
Because I'm on a paper chase (Say what?) I'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced, I be the Mr. Boogeyman
With records from 125th to Japan
I let 'em play like Donny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man
My niggas is my niggas and she didn't understand
I shake your hand and shit'll hit the fan
Just think, just think, what? What if you could just
Just blink, what? Blink yourself away? As I proceed
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall (I shall) proceed (Proceed)
And continue (And continue) to rock the mic (To rock the mic)

Malik B, get on the mic, aiyo, it's too much on my mind
Say what?
Malik, get on the mic, there's too much on my mind

Johnny on the spot, got the rhythm and the rhyme
Fuckin' with The Roots, you know them niggas is a dime
I can make a 100-yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and The Titans clash
And I could make Metallica and Guns N' Roses thrash
Used to smash, crash parties like I was disturbed
Used to make plots against the herringbone herb
But now, all I doâ€”disperse the verb
And like a nerd, I can make you say "He's superb!"
Worded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels, so now you know I'm worth it
Direct from Philly, the land where niggas scheme
So you know I got that sheen in my gleam
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)
I shall proceed (Proceed)
And continue to rock the mic (To rock the mic)1Embed
