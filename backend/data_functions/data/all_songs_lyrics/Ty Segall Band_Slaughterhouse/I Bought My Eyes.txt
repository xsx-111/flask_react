I Bought My Eyes LyricsI was a rich man, I was a poor man
But now I'll never know
During insurgence
My eyes have been worthless
And now I'll never see you
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I made a purchase, my eyes still worthless
I still will never see what it's like to be
She was my lover, she was my other
But now I'll never know, how we will go
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
