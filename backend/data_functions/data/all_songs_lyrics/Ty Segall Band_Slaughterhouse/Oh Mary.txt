Oh Mary LyricsOh Mary, why do you do this 
I'll tell you all don't you know that I'm a wicked man
Oh Mar - ooh, I got you in my pocket
Right next to all of my change and things, my heart is in your locket
Right next to all of my change and things, my heart is in your locket
Oh no
Oh Mary, why do you do this 
I'll tell you all don't you know when I'm a wicked man

Right next to all of my change and things, my heart is in your locket
Right next to all of my change and things, my heart is in your locket
Oh no
