Wave Goodbye Lyrics
I went to church and I went to school
I played by all of your mother's rules
But now it's time to drink the wine
And wave goodbye, bye bye, aah

So lay us down, side by side
Once and for all we shall not hide
So now it's time to taste the guilt
And wave goodbye, bye bye, aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah, aah
Ooh, ooh
Aah, aah
Oh
Fuck yeah2Embed
