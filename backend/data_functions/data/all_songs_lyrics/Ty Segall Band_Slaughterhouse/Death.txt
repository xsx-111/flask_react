Death LyricsI am the eye
I am not clean
Eye of the king
I am living
In my mind, we have fear
The bleeding eye is 
In my eye, have no fear
The bleeding eye is 
In my mind, we have fear
The bleeding eye is 
Take my eye, have no fear
The bleeding eye is 
I am the hound
Of this land
I see your heart
Is bleeding
In our minds, we have fear
The bleeding eye is 
In my hand, have no fear
The bleeding eye is 
In our minds, we have fear
The bleeding eye is 
In my eye, have no fear
The bleeding eye is here
Oh yeah
No
Oh yeah
