Diddy Wah Diddy LyricsIs it rollin'?
Alright, here we go, extra fast
Gotta gal down in Diddy Wah Diddy, woo
Ain't no town and it ain't no city, woo
She was born in the town she has grown in the city
I'm crazy 'bout her going to Diddy Wah Diddy, Wah
Diddy Wah
Well she's as sweet as she could be
Well, I know she's in love with me
She was born in the town she has grown in the city
I'm crazy about my girlfriend in Diddy Wah Diddy
Diddy Wah
Oh, c'mon
Oh
I'm gonna take that girl home
Oh I gotta take that girl home
Yeah you know
Oh I dunno
She's gonna be
Living in my car
I got a nice car
It's a car with... with wheels
Who fucking cares?
Fuck this fucking song
Diddy Wah Diddy
We should've kept going
I don't know what we were doing
Wait, let's rewind it, let's go againEmbed
