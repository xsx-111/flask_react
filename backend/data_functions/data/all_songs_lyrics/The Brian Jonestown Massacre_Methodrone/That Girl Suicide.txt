That Girl Suicide LyricsI can't explain all the things that I'm seeing
And when I look I don't know what I'm seeing
She says relax
'cause I want you to go slow
I close my eyes and
It all goes away though
I get so high I don't know what I'm feeling
And when I fly I am scraping the ceiling
Oh just relax said she you wants go slow
Open my eyes when it all goes away though
I can't explain all the ways that I'm feeling
I reach inside and I'm scraping my feelings
I say relax but I don't want to go slow
Open my eyes when it all goes away thoughEmbed
