Everyone Says LyricsDid you mean what you said
Wish to God you was dead
Pain
Could try to toughen up
Although I think you've had enough
Of Pain
You've tried, tried
Sayin', sayin'
I know
I ?
? was sayin'
Sayin'
Everything reminds me of something you said, yeah
Everybody is watching me running away
Did you mean when you said
You talked to God, he was dead
Pain
Everything reminds me of something you said, yeah
Everybody is watching me running away
Everything reminds me of something you said, yeah
Everybody is watching me running awayEmbed
