Methodrone LyricsYou're living alone in a lie
Dont understand you feel glad
Cause its what you want
Able to trip on a dime
Wondering why it went bad
You thought it could last
Living in love with a lie
Dont understand you're not glad (?)
Its about to end
Lost and alone in your lie
Look at yourself its so sad
Its so sad
Wondering can I unwind
Everythings heading so bad
Its so bad
Its so badEmbed
