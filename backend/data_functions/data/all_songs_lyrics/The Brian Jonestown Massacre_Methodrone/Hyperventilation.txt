Hyperventilation LyricsGetting high
Sniffing glue
Now you're crying
In my room
In my room
In my room
In my room
In my room
Now we know
What to do
Every night
Sniffing glue
Sniffing glue
Sniffing glue
Sniffing glue
More than you
Feeling numb
?
?
Me and you
Sniffing glue
Sniffing glue
Sniffing glue
Me and you
No more crying
Said you'd be here
No more crying
In my room
In my room
In my room
In my room
High on youEmbed
