Evergreen LyricsHelp me
Or make me feel fine
I feel I've wasted my time
Lately
Nothing feels right
I feel like taking my time
Just beneath the floor
Is a new world to explore
Once you've said you loved me
Right behind your door
Is a treasure you've ignored
But you have to trust me
Or nail me to the boards
Crown of thorns for my rewards
And you've said you loved me
Aaaaaahhhhhhhh1Embed
