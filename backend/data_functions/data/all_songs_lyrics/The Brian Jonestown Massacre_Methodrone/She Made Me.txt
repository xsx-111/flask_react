She Made Me LyricsI will wait forever
Waiting for the day
Wait until the moment comes
When i hear you say
That you'll be mine forever
Or until our dying day
There's nothing that can stop me now
From acting in this way
She tries so hard
But she just couldn't show it
Show it all to me
She tries so hard i believe she can do it
She does it all for me
And i've waited a long time
Waiting just to hear her say
She's going to be mine
She tried so hard
But she just couldn't show it
Show it off to me
She tries so hard i believe she can do it
She does it all for meEmbed
