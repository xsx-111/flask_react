I Love You LyricsIf I love you
If I love you girl I want you to know
That I'm never ever lettin' you go
If I show you
If I show you
If I show you 'cause I want you to know
It's the only way I'm lettin' you flow
If I tell you
If I told you like I told you before and I'll tell you again
I really want you as my love and my very best friend
'Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Yes I love you
Yes I...
If I love you
If I love you girl I want you to know
It's the only way I'm lettin' you flow
So I tell you that I love you
And I told you before and...
'Cause I love you
Yes I love you
Yes I love you
Yes I love...Embed
