End of the Day LyricsI want to be
? your hands
I wait to see
I'm meeting your demands
I'm making your demand
So sad
I'm ?
? what you are
?

It's like ?
?

You want much more than I
Can give
You waited for a time
? silently
? sometimes
Took ?
She wants much more than I
Can give
?
Not sorry I
Was what you want
To ?
You want much more than I
Can give
Can giveEmbed
