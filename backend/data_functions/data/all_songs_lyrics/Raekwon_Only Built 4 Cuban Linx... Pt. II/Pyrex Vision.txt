Pyrex Vision Lyrics
Niggas got me the behind the pot again, but yo
"Fuck, with your pot again?"

The Pyrex is bubbling, the stove is broke
Fuck it, use the flame from the oven, the famous dozen
Bout to hit the streets, they buzzing
Break it down, yo, chop it like he raided your luggage
Major yellow shit in the pot, struggling
Tryna form a rock up, and double it, and call up my cousin
"What up beloved?" Stab it, tilt and twirl, spit in it
Plus, put a little bit of milk in—the fiends love it
Sat back, confident in comfort, the light blew out
All I see is all white stuff, suds in it
Four hundred razors in a bucket, seventy plates
We thinking ten mil a man—nigga, fuck it
It's on, get the baking soda, dump it
How many niggas'll pump to get eighty more? Get it jumping
Live by the code, and we thumping
Nigga, take this
Fuck around and taste a flake: "Bitch, you drunk it"
It's all in the eyes of the hungry
It's all for the wise and the humbly, their eyes came upon meEmbed
