New Wu Lyrics
"What up, son?. Maintaining, maintaining, you know?
You good, Rah? Everything proper, still, Rah? Come on, man. What's the matter with you, man?"
"Ain't nothing. I just want us to be on"

Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a "Soo!"
Get it right—all my chicks, hold your tits, let's get it in
All my niggas, take a toke off this weed, let it begin
(Here we go!) Yo, y'all already know what it do (Ha, ha)
Brand-new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw your Ws up!
Back from the slums, it be the Wu

Love to dress latch, get rocked
Hundred bags, black do-rags, ski masks is on, G-Wags
Don't try to take pictures, 'lax, still in the grass
You'll learn respect, bust when I ask
Rhyme-master Busy Wizzy on the subject, love Deck
Thug battles, drug vets, snub sets
Iller than most, nighttime totes, gorillas in boats
Three votes, villas is killer, gangsta feel notes
Hibernation, yo, switch up, liver nation, fly information
Vivid vacation, deliberation moments
Move like 91 Romans, cloning everything
Gents only, the rent's on the stove, I'm in Rome
Maxed out, annex style, my team brand bandits
Make a move and get blown off the planet, baby
Hold that cannon, just understand
We got the whole shit padlocked down, my niggas won't have it
Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a "Soo!"
Get it right—all my chicks, hold your tits, let's get it in
All my niggas, take a toke off this weed, let it begin
(Here we go!) Yo, y'all already know what it do (Ha, ha)
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw your Ws up!
Back from the slums, it be the Wu (Yeah, yo)

Ayo, jumping out of Benz wagons, my family live in the Hill
They call us Bin Ladens, laughing, turban'd up
Faggot niggas get murdered up
These streets is like radio beef, so watch how the kid turn it up
Bulletproof tuxes, knuckle games is clobbering busters
Eighteen niggas is bringing the ruckus
Flamethrowers on our backs and shoulders
The rusty joints still work
The trey-eight'll blow one of your dojos
When there's mad heat, I'm mad calm
Walk around, gold collect, 36 O before G bomb
My inner strength flowing, I mastered Qi-Gong
Y'all Planet of the Apes, standing next to King Kong
Forensic file, ultraviolet hype, sky blue Bals
Laying niggas like ceramic tile
I'm like Urlacher, beasting at the top of the pile
Kneeing niggas in the nuts, nigga, damn, I'm foul!
Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a "Soo!"
Get it right—all my chicks, hold your tits, let's get it in
All my niggas, take a toke off this weed, let it begin
(Here we go!) Yo, y'all already know what it do (Ha, ha)
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw your Ws up!
Back from the slums, it be the Wu (Yo, yo, yo)

We blow money, got game, hungry, we pop things
Look for me, grams in my pocket Chef cooked for me
Blue Magic bundles, I'm dope
But on the humble, I'm a good dude
"Don't shortchange me", see, that's a hood rule
Beer-drinking, Cuban Linking, new way of thinking
Got me thinking, "Meth, break the handcuffs, run out the precinct"
This is hardbody, hard knocks, if you pushing that hard rock
Then, let these niggas go off top
We rock fitteds, drop kid-id, I lived it, it's not, quit it
I pinch it, my pops sniffed it, need business, I'm not finished
I'm *tsss* too hot with it, you bitching, the plot thicken
I'm shitting the Glock, spitting, if niggas don't stop snitching
This what the block missing
The two-seater with the top missing
And two divas with they tops missing
Now, that's living to me, I'm what these kids is killing to be
But I don't want my children to be
Tell a friend, it's that symbol again, that W
Coming through, bust a shot on your block, give me a "Soo!"
Get it right—all my chicks, hold your tits, let's get it in
All my niggas, take a toke off this weed, let it begin
(Here we go!) Yo, y'all already know what it do (Ha, ha)
Brand new, nigga, back from the slums, it be the Wu
Now throw your Ws up!
Back from the slums, it be the Wu8Embed
