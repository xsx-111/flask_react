Cold Outside Lyrics
"We do have to fear him
The Shaolin faces a crisis
And one of the factors will be the Wu-Tang Clan"
"I just wish he was here now..."
"So we must all be prepared"

Damn
Them niggas over there, man
Whoa, ho
Feds been on them niggas all fucking year, son
What I'm gonna deal when it's cold outside?
Look: the nigga's in a bag right now
High, high
They zipping a nigga off, son
Right
Ah, ah, oh, whoa, oh
It's co-oh-oh-oh-oh-old
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice (Yeah)
When it's cold outside (Yeah), and the rain turn to ice (Yeah)
Said mama's out here flipping out, shots just going off
Somebody laid out, little kids smoking weed
Drive-bys every day, wonder what's going on
Here outside with my motherfucking AK

Oh, ho
What I'm gonna deal when it's cold outside?
High, high
Ah, ah, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa
It's co-oh-oh-oh-oh-old, hey

Religious with hammers, fakes get jammed up
Cakes get battered, coming through to get it, them transactions
Blood-stinking fiends, machine guns, cannons and teams
Baking sodas, gold Rovers and gophers
Land in every project, sex, lies, murderous reps
Back to cassettes, vets dying on steps
What's really taking place in them hoods?
Heads get clapped for trap
Don't fuck with my mind, I'm strapped
Off with your dome for fronting on me
Last two Ls, I seen visions of dead males and more sales
Real-life stories is made, and candles got blazed
For little young soldiers shot by them strays
Pigeons and goons surviving in prisons
'Cause divisions, they separating, laying cocoons
And they can't wait to come home soon
While bodies get found in lobbies
Chopped up, decaying in rooms
They found a two year old, strangled to death
With a "Love Daddy" shirt on in a bag on the top of the steps
Police blowing niggas, NARCs and judges
Me and son had beef, I had to murk him, we supposed to be brothers
'Cause he came home fronting, feeling like that I owe him something
Cause I'm getting money, drive a little something-something
Lanae got AIDS, with five kids smoked out
House is brick, bills haven't been paid in days
Her Brooklyn man's a molestor, court case, and the crime's raising
Swastikas on the church, they Satan
Holiday season is here, and I'm vexed
Who the fuck made Christmas up?
I'm fucking broke, it ain't making no sense
Newports are $7.50, a box of Huggies is off the meat rack
She's back, thirty days, she relapsed
Our troops need to leave Iraq
And rap niggas need to go on strike so we can get more cash
'Cause...

When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
Said mama's out here flipping out, shots just going off
Somebody laid out, little kids smoking weed
Drive-bys every day, wonder what's going on
Here outside with my motherfucking AK

Oh, ho
What I'm gonna deal when it's cold outside?
High, high
Ah, ah, oh, oh
Whoa, whoa
It's co-oh-oh-oh-oh-old, hey1Embed
