Diamonds Lyrics
All I am is the bones you made for me
So garishly clean
White as the horses
That carry me away

All my demons, you said
Come and go with the days
A mind's will to play
I grow old in my ways, just like you do

There ain't no diamonds in the bottom
There ain't no darkness that I fear
There ain't no way to say I love you more
So be clear, just to be clear
So be clear, just to be clear

All I am is the bones you made for me
Just driftwood for the sea
Heavy as the horses
That carry me away
(That carry me away)
There ain't no diamonds in the bottom
There ain't no darkness that I fear
There ain't no way to say I love you more, no
So be clear, be clear

There ain't no diamonds in the bottom
There ain't no darkness that I fear
There ain't no way to say I love you more
So be clear, just to be clear8Embed
