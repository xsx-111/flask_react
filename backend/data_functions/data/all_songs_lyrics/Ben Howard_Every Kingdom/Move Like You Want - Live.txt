Move Like You Want - Live Lyrics
We'll, we'll play you one last one shall we?
Thank you all for coming out, this has been ridiculous, thank you so much-
This ones called move like you want, I hope you enjoy the song

I saw you, earlier on
They were playing blues downtown
Some kind of Mississippi, Mississippi song
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh I caught your eye
Because you darling, you darling, oh honey you caught mine

So lady get down
Woah ohh like there's no-one else around to

Oh no, honey move like you want
Baby move, like you need
Oh na, baby move like you ought to
Honey, move just to please me
Woah ohh ohh ohh
Baby, move like you want
Baby, move like you need
Oh I saw you, watching the band play slow now now now
Eyes like a morning star
Oh in the soft of the early evening glow
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh you were burning up inside, alright
Because these feelings, the-ese-ese feelings are so hard to hide

So darling get low
Woah ohh like there's no-one else around to

Oh na, baby move like you want
Lady, move like you need
Woah ohh ohh
Honey, move like you ought to
Baby, move just to plea-ea-ease-
Woah ohh ohh
Baby, move like you wanna
Lady, move like you need-

Oh lady get down
Woah ohh ohh like there's no-one else around
Ohyea woman oh get down
Woah ohh ohh like there's no-one else around to
Woah ohh ohh like there's no-one else
Woah ohh ohh like there's no-one else around to
Woah ohh ohh like there's no-one else around to
Woah ohh ohh like there's no-one else around to
Woah ohh ohh like there's no-one else around to
Woah ohh ohh like there's no-one else around-
Baby, move like you want
Oh honey, move like you need
Oh oh oh oh no
Baby, move like you ought to
Honey, move just to plea-ea-ea-ease me
Oh oh oh oh no
Baby, move

Oh lady get down
Oh ohh
Like there's no-one else around
Oh woman get down
Oh ohh
Like there's no-one else around

Take it away

Oh you have Brad Bond on guitar
What about Chris Bond on drums
India Bourne on bassEmbed
