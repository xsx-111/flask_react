The Fear Lyrics
My, my cold hearted child
Tell me how you feel
Just a blade in the grass
A spoke unto the wheel
My, my cold hearted child
Tell me where it's all gone
Oh the luster of your bones
Those arms that held you strong

I've been worrying
That my time here's a little unclear
I've been worrying
That I'm losing the ones I hold dear
I've been worrying
That we all
Live our lives
In the confines of fear

My, my cold hearted child
Tell me how you feel
Just a grain in the morning air
Dark shadow on the hill
My, my cold hearted child
Tell me where it all falls (Tell me where it all falls)
This apathy you feel
Will make a fool of us all

I've been worrying
That my time here's a little unclear
I've been worrying
That I'm losing the ones I hold dear
I've been worrying
That we all
Live our lives
In the confines of fear

I will become what I deserve
Oh, I will become what I deserve
Oh, I will become what I deserve
Oh, I will become what I deserve
Oh, I will become what I deserve
(I've been worrying, I've been worrying)
Oh, I will become what I deserve
(I've been worrying my time is a little unclear)
Oh, I will become what I deserve
I've been worrying, I've been worrying
That my time here's a little unclear
I've been worrying, I've been worrying
That I'm losing the ones I hold dear
I've been worrying, I've been worrying
That we all
All live our lives
In the confines of fear7Embed
