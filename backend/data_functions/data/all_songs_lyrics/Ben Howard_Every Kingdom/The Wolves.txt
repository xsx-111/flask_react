The Wolves Lyrics
Falling from high places
Falling through lost spaces
Now that we're lonely
Now that there's nowhere to go
Watching from both sides
These clock towers burning up
I lost my time here
I lost my patience with it all
And we lost faith in the arms of love

Where you been hiding lately?
Where you been from hiding from the news?
Because we've been fighting lately
We've been fighting with the wolves
Red tongues and hands

Falling from high places
Falling through lost spaces
Now that we're lonely
Now that we're so far from home
Watching from both sides
These towers been tumbling down
I lost my mind here
I lost my patience with the Lord
And we lost faith in the arms of love

Where you been hiding lately?
Where you been from hiding from the news?
Because we've been fighting lately
We've been fighting with the wolves
Red tongues and hands
Red tongues and hands

We lost faith in the arms of love
Oh, love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh, love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh, love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Oh, love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love (love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)
Love, love, love (love, love, love)6Embed
