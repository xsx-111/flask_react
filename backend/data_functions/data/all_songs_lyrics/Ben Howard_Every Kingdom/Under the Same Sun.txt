Under the Same Sun LyricsI lie in your charms
Though it harms the best of me
And I lie on to my friends to them
No wonder why I wait for thee
And I hope like a child
Widow of the sea
I hold these arms around you
Walls around me
Will you be there when the day's done
Will you be there
Under the same, under the same sun
Under the same, under the same sun
My yearn oughta turn these things
Turn these things around
I learned from you
Oh I made these plans, made this plans
With you around dear
With you around dear
Will you be there when the day's done
Will you be there
Under the same, under the same sun
Under the same sun
Will you be there when the day's done
Will you be there
Under the same, under the same sun
Under the same, under the same sun
Under the same sun, under the same sun
Under the same sun, under the same sun
Under the same sun, under the same sun
Under the same sun, under the same sun
Under the same sun, under the same sun
Under the same sun, under the same
Lalalala lovely as you are
Lalalala lovely as you are
Lalalala lovely as you are
Lalalala lovely as you are
Lalalala lovely as you are
Lalalala lovely as you are2Embed
