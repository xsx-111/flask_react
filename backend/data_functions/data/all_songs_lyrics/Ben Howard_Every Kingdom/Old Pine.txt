Old Pine Lyrics
Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know that memories
Were the best things you ever had
The summer shone, beat down on bony backs
So far from home, where the ocean stood
Down dust and pine cone tracks
We slept like dogs down by the fire side
Awoke to the fog where all around us
The boom of summertime

We stood steady as the stars
In the woods so happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
And as the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning

Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags
I've come to know the friends around you
Are all you'll always have
Smoke in my lungs, the echoed stone
Careless and young, free as the birds that fly
With weightless souls
We stood steady as the stars
In the woods so happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
We stood steady as the stars
In the woods so happy-hearted
And the warmth rang true inside these bones
And as the old pine fell we sang
Just to bless the morning

We grow, grow steady as the morning
We grow, older still
We grow, grow happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow older still
We grow, grow steady as the flowers
We grow, older still
We grow, grow happy as a new dawn
We grow, grow older still18Embed
