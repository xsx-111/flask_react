I saw red and yellow flowers outside over the moors
And brightest sunrise ever to've touched my eyes
And through it all
I stood and stumbled, waded through my thoughts and heart
Yeah through it all
I fooled and fumbled, lost to the poet's frown
I fought the wolves of patience just to let it lie down
See these waters they'll pull you up
Oh if you're bolder than the darkness
My my, let these songs be an instrument to cut
Oh spaces 'tween the happiness and the hardness
Yeah, my my spaces 'tween the happiness and the hardness
Out the door
The touch of morning, the burning of the frost
Out the door
My strong hands to hold; good friends that I never lost
And what we found
Down these coves of limestone and cockle shells
What we found
Down these roads that wander as lost as the heart
Is a chance to breathe again, a chance for a fresh start
My, my a chance to breathe again, a chance for a fresh start
Oh my a chance to breathe again, a chance for a fresh start
Oh, no, see these waters they'll pull you up
Oh, no, if you're bolder than the darkness
My my let these songs be an instrument to cut here darling
Oh, spaces between the happiness and the hardness
Oh my my, spaces between the happiness and the hardness
Oh my my, spaces between the happiness and the hardness
Oh my my, spaces between the happiness and the hardnessEmbed
