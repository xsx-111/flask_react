Empty Corridors - Live In York/2011 Lyrics
She's got a little house in town
I sometimes go around, there
To see her
And she let me deep inside
I sing her love songs
But she'll turn a blind eye
Cause she, ain't the sentimental type
I keep my heart in my pocket and I hold
I hold it tight

I know that she don't mind if I
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if I'm
Absent through it all
I know that she don't mind if I
Go away and I don't call
I know, that she, don't mind if I'm
Absent through it all
Through it all
Through it all
Through it all

Her skin is softer than the bluest eyes
Just with the warmth that I need
Gives me a place
To hide from the streetlights
Burning through the bedroom window
Oh honey the shadows, there's loneliness we cling to
When the morning comes
We'll go, we'll go our separate ways here
Ain't no magic my dear, ain't no reason to stay
I know that she don't mind if I
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if I'm
Absent through it all
I know that she don't mind if I
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if I'm
Absent through it all
Through it all
Through it all
Through it all

And we fall through empty corridors
And we talk in our useless metaphors
Yeah we fall through empty corridors
And we talk in our useless metaphors
And we fall through empty corridors
And we talk in our useless metaphors

Only 'cause we're lonely
Only 'cause we're lonely
Only 'cause we're lonely
Only 'cause we're lonely
Only lonely
Only lonely
Only 'cause we're lonely
Only 'cause we're lonely
Only here
My my my lonely
Lonely here1Embed
