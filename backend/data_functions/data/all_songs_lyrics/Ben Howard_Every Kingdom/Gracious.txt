Gracious Lyrics
How would you know?
When everything around you's changing
Like the weather of a big black storm
And who would you turn to?
Had I a ghost, a shadow at the most
Would you let me know?

'Cause I don't want to
Trouble your mind with a childish design
Of how it all should go
But I love you so
When it all comes clear, when the wind it settles
I'll be here, you know

'Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sun upon that place
Darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget
The plans and the silhouettes you drew here
Gracious goes the ghost of you
My dear
How would you know?
When everything around you's bruised and battered
Like the cold night storm
And who would you turn to?
Had I a ghost, a shadow at the most
Would you tell me so?

Cause I, I adore you so
When it all comes clear, when the wind it settles
I'll be here, you know

Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sun upon that place
Darling, I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget
The plans and the silhouettes you drew here
Gracious goes the ghost of you
My dear
Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget
The plans and the silhouettes you drew here
Gracious goes the ghost of you
My dear1Embed
