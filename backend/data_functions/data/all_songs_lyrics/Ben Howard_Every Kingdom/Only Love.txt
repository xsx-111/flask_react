Only Love Lyrics
Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, my only love
Darling, I feel you under my body
Only love, my only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on, love, come on, love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart...

And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep

Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, my only love
Darling, I feel you under my body
Only love, my only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on, love, come on, love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart

And I'll be yours to keep
A wind in the shadows, whale song in the deep
A wind in the shadows, whale song
Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, my only love
Darling, I feel you under my body
Only love, my only love
Give me shelter, or show me heart
Come on, love, come on, love
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart

Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Only love, love, love
Girl, show me heart
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Watch me fall apart
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Come on love, love, love
Girl, show me heart
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Show me love, love, love
Watch me fall apart
Watch me fall apart

Darling, I feel you under my body
Darling, you're with me, forever and always
Give me shelter or show me heart
And watch me fall apart, watch me fall apart14Embed
