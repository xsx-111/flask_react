Promise Lyrics
Meet me there
With bundles of flowers
We'll wade through the hours
Of cold, winter
She'll howl at the walls
Tearing down doors
Of time, shelter, as we go

And promise me this
You'll wait for me only
Scared of the lonely arms
That surface, far below these birds

And maybe, just maybe, I'll come home

Oh, who am I, darling, to you?
Who am I to tell you stories of mine?
Who am I?
Oh, who am I, darling, for you?
Who am I to be your burden in time? Lonely
Who am I to you?
And who am I, darling, for you?
Who am I to be your burden?
And who am I, darling, to you?
Who am I?
I come alone here
I come alone here29Embed
