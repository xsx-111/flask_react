I Will Be Blessed Lyrics
Oh my ghost came by
Said who do you love the most
Who you wanna call before you die
Oh my ghost came by here
Said who do you love the most
Who you gonna sing to 'fore you're gone

Oh hey heaven is the place we know
Heaven is the arms that hold us
Long before we go
Oh hey, heaven is the place we know
Heaven is the arms that hold us
Long before we go

Oh my ghost came by here
Said who do you love the most
Who you gonna sing to 'fore you go

Oh hey heaven is the place we know
Heaven is the arms that hold us
Long before we go
Oh hey, heaven is the place we know
Heaven is the arms that hold us
Long before we go
Oh if you're there when the world
Comes to gather me in, oh if you're there
I will be blessed
Oh if you're there when the world
Comes to gather me in, oh if you're there
I will be blessed
Oh if you're there when the world
Comes to gather me in, oh if you're there
I will be blessed
I will be blessed

Oh if you're there when the world
Comes to gather me in, oh if you're there
I will be blessed
I will be blessed4Embed
