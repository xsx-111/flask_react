Bones LyricsOh go, far from this small town bar we know
Yeah go, frolic in the lights that brought you here
So very long
And hold, hold your lips so tightly
That the shadows may go
Cause I know, I know, I know I know
You can never be alone
Cause it's just the bones you're made of
And you laugh like you've never been lonely
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you laugh like there's hope in the story
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you laugh like I'll be there to hold you always
Always here
I'm always here, always here
And go silent as death on the first day of the snow
Oh go leave these fires burning
A house of embers and coal
And covert, covert all those boys that search for love
In your room
Cause lust is just a child's game
And you, oh you were always late to bloom
And you laugh like you've never been lonely
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you laugh like there's hope in the story
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you laugh like I'll be there to hold you always
Always here
Always honey, always here
And you love like you've always been lonely
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you love him with all of your body
That's alright honey
That's alright with me
Oh you love him like he'll be there for always
Always honey yeah, always near
Always honey, always near
Always honey, always near
Oh go far from this small town bar we know
Oh go, leave me with this bird and this song
Out here in the cold
Cause it's just the bones you're made of9Embed
