May Your Hearts Stay Strong LyricsHe met her at a nightclub. She couldn't keep the beat
She wore her grandma's prom dress, raccoon slippers on her feet
He took a shot of something strong to make him feel less weak
And so the story goes...
There's something to be said about trading stories of when you were 8 years old:
He had his first stitches when he bit an ice cream bowl
She had her first kiss in a swimming hole
And so the story goes...
And the days grew long, and the wine was overflowing
And she knew she was in love, because nobody ever hugged her like that
Hugged her like that, hugged her like that, hugged her like that
They moved into a school bus just because it seemed like fun
She'd say "I like the way you touch me, it makes me feel like I have no skeleton,"
And so the story goes...
And I've seen photographs and video tapes
Of that diesel home that loving place
And it's about time two minds entwined in such a fine, fine way
May your lives be long
May your wishes all be simple
And may your hearts stay strong
Tucked into bed, is she the ghost of your teddy bear
Check under the covers just to make sure he's still sleeping there
Turn wedding gowns to angel cloths for the baby to wear
Turn wedding gowns to angel cloths for the baby to wear
She's rides him like the State Fair
They make love like two solar flares
Caring like they really care
That they're gonna make it
He wants to die in the place where she first said "I love you."
Spread his ashes with the breath of the last kiss that she blew
They decorate when featherless;
They celebrate through hungriness
And it's about time two minds entwined in such a fine, fine way
May your lives be long
May your wishes all be simple
And may your hearts stay strong
May your lives be long
May your wishes all be simple
And may your hearts stay strongEmbed
