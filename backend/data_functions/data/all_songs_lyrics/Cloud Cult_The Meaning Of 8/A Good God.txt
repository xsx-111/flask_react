A Good God LyricsAnd for a moment I saw God
And it was so effing precious
It was an 80 year old dog
A little girl kissing a frog
A little boy who thought Jesus was He-Man
And then, and then
And then, and then
And then, and then
I found divinity in the hole in the front of your head
You spoke of bubblegum bums
You dressed the devil in a thong
You turned funeral cries into lullaby songs
