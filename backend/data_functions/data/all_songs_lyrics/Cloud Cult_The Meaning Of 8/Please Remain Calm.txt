Please Remain Calm LyricsHis Sunday best includes the helmet of an astronaut
Tablecloth cape, embroidered number 8 sayin'
'I am a proud man, I am a proud man'
Dancin' to the beat of a mother coming down, sing it
Please remain calm
Please remain calm
It's hard to tell the difference of a prophet from a crackpot
I wouldn't blame you if you'd rather stay in bed
We'd go smilin', we'd go down smilin'
Dancin' to the beat of a mother coming down, take it
Please remain calm
Please remain calm
Calm
This is a test of the emergency broadcasting system
This is a test, this is only a test
You can stand single file, put your head between your legs
You can stop drop and roll 'cause this is only a test, kick itEmbed
