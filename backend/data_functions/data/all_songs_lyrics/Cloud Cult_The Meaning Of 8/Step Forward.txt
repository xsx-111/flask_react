Step Forward LyricsWhen your life is finished burning down
You'll be all that's left standing there
You'll become a baby cumulus
And fly up to the firmament
And no one gets to know the purpose
We need to learn to live without knowing
But all we are saying
Is step forward, step forward
We can only see a small part of everything and nothing
When you finally know you can't know
Step forward, step forward
And if you don't believe in miracles
It comes with every single heartbeat
Another opportunity
Step forward, step forward
And everybody here is trying so hard
To make things a little better
I never got a chance to thank you
Step forward, step forward
And everybody here is trying so hard
To make things a little better
All we are saying is step forward, step forward
When your life is finished burning down
You'll be all that's left standing there
You'll become a baby cumulus
And fly up to the firmamentEmbed
