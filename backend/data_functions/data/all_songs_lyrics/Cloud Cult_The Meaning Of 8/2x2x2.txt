2x2x2 LyricsYou and I make a lovely shape
Two circles cubed draw a number 8
It's a perfect day to dress the kids in snowsuits
While we bake bread through the monsoon
Cause I'm in love with you
And all that we've been through
We're finally coming to
Two by two by two
This is the meaning of the number 8
The meaning of the number 8
The meaning of the number 8
8, 8, 8, 8...
Shape the pain into something great
Disintegrate and reintegrate
Let's go live like Sunday morning cartoons
Grow Christmas trees from tombs
Cause I'm in love with you
And all that we've been through
We're finally coming to
Two by two by two
This is the meaning of the number 8
The meaning of the number 8
The meaning of the number 8
8, 8, 8, 8...Embed
