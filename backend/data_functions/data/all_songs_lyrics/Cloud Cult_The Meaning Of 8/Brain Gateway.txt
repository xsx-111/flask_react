Brain Gateway LyricsI'll turn my stupid brain into a gateway
Meet me in the place where life comes to get away
I'll turn my stupid brain into a gateway
Meet me in the place where life comes to get away
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here we go, ho
It's nice to meet you, ho ho
It's nice to meet you, ho ho
You are a special one, don't you know
Go back and show them a hopeful show
You are a special one, don't you know
Back inside my body I pick up the pieces
Come up my friends and welcome another day
Back inside my body I pick up the pieces
Come up my friends and welcome another day
Damn that stupid brain
Back inside my body I pick up the pieces
Come on my friends and welcome another day
Damn that stupid brainEmbed
