Take Your Medicine LyricsGot myself a new look
Something gave me another chance to see
Each time, each time I will try to do better
Right now, right now is where I guess I belong
Pulled my fist from my mouth
I beat myself for a quarter century
Remind, remind that it's bigger than me
Dissolve, dissolve into evergreens
These are things that I keep hidden in belly
I can't see them but they control my life
For a moment you could see right through me
See right through me
Help me make this right
Look at all those skeletons running from their closets
Get them in the light!
These are things that I keep hidden in belly
I can't see them but they control my life
For a moment you could see right through me
See right through me
Help me make this right
Look at all those skeletons running from their closets
Get them in the light!
You can take it in stride, or you can take it right between the eyes
Suck up, suck up and take your medicine
It's a good day, it's a good day to face the hard things
Pulled my fist from my mouth
I beat myself for a quarter century
Remind, remind that it's bigger than me
Dissolve, dissolve into evergreens
We found beautiful babies sleeping in our ribs
Get them in the light
Get them in the light
You can take it in stride, or you can take it right between the eyes
Suck up, suck up and take your medicine
We found beautiful babies sleeping in our ribs
Get them in the light
Get them in the light
You can take it in stride, or you can take it right between the eyes
Suck up, suck up and take your medicineEmbed
