The Girl Underground LyricsFreddy fell in love with a girl underground
He was only 8 years old when he started digging down
Singing "I love you more than you know"
Mother said "Fred, people underground are dead
You've never even seen her, something's wrong with your head
And "I love you more than you know"
Freddy disappeared when he was 80 years old
Still digging for his lover in a bottomless hole
Singing "I love you more than you know"
Some say he's still digging, others say his love is found
You can still hear him singing, put your ear to the ground
Listen: "I love you more than you know"Embed
