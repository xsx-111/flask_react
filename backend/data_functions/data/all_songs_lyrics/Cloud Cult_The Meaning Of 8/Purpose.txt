Purpose LyricsThere must be purpose here cause most of us keep waking up
(Don't you think it's pretty here)
It's so unexpectedly predictable
So sloppily intentional
Does anyone know the punchline yet
There must be rhythm here cause all of us have a heartbeat
(Don't you see the music here)
Inside our ribs we take an average of 60 beats a minute
A-rum-pum-pum-pum
A-rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
There must be forgiveness here cause most of us have our weaknesses
(Tell me what are your weaknesses)
I don't know myself and I'm afraid of you
I'm happiest on chemicals
The goings come and the comings go
Forgive me I'm just an animal
There must be healing here cause everybody here has been damaged
And we'll wear it like a tattoo
Every scar is a smile
To hell with the going down
There must be afterlife here cause we all pray for resurrection
You see the end comes quick as a bulletEmbed
