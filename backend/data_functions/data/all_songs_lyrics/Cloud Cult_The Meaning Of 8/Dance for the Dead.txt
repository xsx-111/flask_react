Dance for the Dead LyricsThis is the dance
That brings the dead to the living
Just say "I miss you
Every day you know"
This is the dance
That brings the dead to the living
They say "I'm with you
Every day you know"
This is the dance
That brings the dead to the living
Just say "I miss you
Every day you know"
This is the dance
That brings the dead to the living
They say "I'm with you
Every day you know"
Can you hear them come? (x8)
This is the dance
That brings the dead to the living
Just say "I miss you
Every day you know"Embed
