Pretty Voice LyricsThe scene begins
With a hermit's melody
Sung by a bashful bird
Hung in a violet sky
There are no words
But there's understanding
It's been so long
Since I've heard that pretty voice
Raise up the lights
And enter hero girl
She makes me calm
God, she makes me calm
Then she hears the song
And she starts singing
It's been so long
Since I've heard that pretty voice
Strike up the band
Here comes the storyline
About the usual struggle
Between fear and love
This is the lifelong song
That we're all singing
It's been so long
Since I've heard that pretty voice
When it begins
I miss your harmony
But you're so shy
You're such a bashful bird
Here's a song
But no one's singing
It's been so long
Since I've heard your pretty voiceEmbed
