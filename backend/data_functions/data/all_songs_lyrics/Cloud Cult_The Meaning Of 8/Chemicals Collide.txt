Chemicals Collide LyricsI was out paying close attention
Or was I lost inside my thoughts
These days it's hard to tell what's outside from what's in my mind
And oh god, it's beautiful
Insatiable
The way our chemicals collide
I was out catching up to tomorrow
Or was I caught up in the past
These days it's hard to tell what's out in front from what's behind
And oh god, it's unforgettable
Unpredictable
The way our chemicals collide
I was sleeping in the lilies
Or was I up all night
These days it's hard to tell what's half asleep from fully alive
We were loving like a landslide
Or were we in a fight
These days it's hard to tell what's right from wrong and wrong from right
And oh god, it's beautiful
Insatiable
The way our chemicals collide
And oh god, it's unforgettable
Unpredictable
The way our chemicals collideEmbed
