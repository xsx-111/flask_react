Chain Reaction LyricsYou have eyes like mine
Are we strangers or am I you are I
Put your face on mine
Put your face on mine
What you feel makes part of what they'll feel
It's a chain reaction
Put out fear and they'll feel fear
It's a chain reaction
Put out love and they'll feel love
It's a chain reaction
Put your face on mine
Put your face on mineEmbed
