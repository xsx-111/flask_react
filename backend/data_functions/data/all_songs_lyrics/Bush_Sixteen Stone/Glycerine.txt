Glycerine Lyrics
It must be your skin, I'm sinking in
It must be for real, 'cause now I can feel
And I didn't mind, It's not my kind
It's not my time to wonder why
Everything gone white, everything's grey
Now you're here, now you're away
I don't want this, remember that
I'll never forget where you're at

Don't let the days go by
Glycerine, Glycerine

I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time
Are you at one? Or do you lie?
We live in a wheel where everyone steals
But when we rise, it's like strawberry fields
I treated you bad, you bruise my face
Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you
I couldn't change though I wanted to
It should have been easier by three
Our old friend fear and you and me
Glycerine, Glycerine
Don't let the days go by
Glycerine
Don't let the days go by....
Glycerine, Glycerine
Glycerine, Glycerine
Bad moon white again
Bad moon white again
As she falls around me

I needed you more, you wanted us less
I could not kiss, just regress
It might just be clear, simple and plain
Well that's just fine, that's just one of my names

Don't let the days go by
Could've been easier on you, you, you
Glycerine, Glycerine
Glycerine, Glycerine22Embed
