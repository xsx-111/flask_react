Bomb LyricsWanted to buy you shiny red things
Thought I'd be with you until the end
How did I know that I would be there
Blow me away, see if I care
Death of a future, goodbye to my friends
Wish I would see you all again
Family hollow, family real
Wish you were here, see how I feel
Oh, kill a man
Oh, kill a girl
Oh, kill a man
Oh, kill a girl
Oh, kill a man
Oh, kill a girl
Jekyll in you brings out the wired in me
I have no defense, I'm all that you see
The night is a bomb blast, the night is on fire
Sing with me in the gasoline choir
Oh, kill a man
Oh, kill a girl
Oh, kill a man
Oh, kill a girl
Oh, kill a man
Oh, kill a girl
Oh, kill a man
Oh, kill a girl
Oh, kill a man
Oh, kill a girl
I killed a man
I killed a man
I killed a man
I killed a man
And you say you want to change our minds
I've paid for your belief with mine
Of all the bravest stands in time
You stoop so low, you'll never riseEmbed
