Swim Lyrics
Could not believe, came here today
Helmet was on, you blew me away
House is on fire, we're naked again
Maybe all we need is water and friends
Shackles and chains won't keep me away
Temple is you and my brow is insane

I wanna be just like you
I wanna feel right through you
I wanna see just with you
I wanna live, I wanna die you

Thinning ice, fourteen hairdryers
I'm swimming to you, flame on earth desire
Poor on the rise, rich on the fall
This cripple's with you, fame is a whore

I wanna be just like you
I wanna feel right through you
I wanna see just with you
I wanna live, I wanna die you
I wanna fit inside you
I wanna room inside you
If money talks, I wanna buy you
I wanna die, I wanna die
I wanna live you
I'm not scared of you, could give up on drugs
If I make it through the jaws of love
The jaws of love
Your hand in my hand
For why I found

I wanna be just like you
I wanna feel right through you
I wanna see just with you
I wanna die
I wanna live you
I wanna fit inside you
I wanna room inside you
If money talks, if money talks
If money talks, if money talks

You give and you give and you give
You give and you give and you give
You give and you give and you give
You give and you give and you give and
You give and you give and you give and
You give and you give and you give and
You give and you give and you give and youEmbed
