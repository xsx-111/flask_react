Testosterone Lyrics
I'm a man
I'm real proud of my manhood
I like to smoke
Ten thousand cigarillos

Eightball
I could climb any fountains
I never cry
I only bawl when I'm losing
And I've never been wrong
Never been wrong
Never been wrong
I'm looking so good
Looking so good
Looking so good

Got a big gold gun
Got a big gold gun
Got a big gold bullet
And I guess you could say
And I guess you could say
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
Full of, full of, full of
I'm real straight
You wanna see my peccadillos
Hot dog, 7:30 every morning
And I'm big into war
Big into war
Big into war
I am a whore
I am a whore
I am a whore

Got a big gold gun
Got a big gold gun
Got a big gold bullet
And I guess you could say
Yeah, I guess you could say
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
You're real full of it
We're real full of it

I shave with Gillette
Shave with Gillette
Shave with Gillette
And I'm patting my back
Patting my back
Patting my back
Got a big gold gun
Got a big gold
Got a big gold gun
Got a big gold gun
Got a big gold bullet
And I guess you could say
Yeah I guess you could say
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of it
I'm real full of itEmbed
