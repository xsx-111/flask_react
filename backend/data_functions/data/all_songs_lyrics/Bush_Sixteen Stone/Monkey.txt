Monkey Lyrics
The mind is all, we kiss everything
We say we love, it's the skin we're in
You're a retrograde, a vacancy
You're the one I love, the hate in me

On a lazy day
On a darker breed
To have is not what it's made to be
You come alone on a mass attack
Sucking your tantric suck
Fooling your one-eyed cat

We, we don't mind
We, we don't mind

We deviate our gravy brains
Set 'em on fire, they're all the same
I am lionface, no Sancho Panza
I'm riddled by you, I could've been better

We, we don't mind
We don't mind, we don't mind
I'm a monkey on a drip
Sucker monkey on a drip
I'm a monkey on a drip
Sucker monkey on a drip
Sucker monkey on a drip
Sucker monkey on a drip
Your monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey
Monkey

You take these pretty photos
When will you be worthy of your good side?
Where will you be when the clouds break?
And it all takes just a little more than you have

We don't mind
We don't mind, we don't mind

I'm a monkey on a drip
Sucker monkey on a drip
I'm a monkey on a drip
Sucker monkey on a drip
I'm a monkey on a drip
Sucker monkey on a drip
Your monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, yeah
Your monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, monkey, yeah
Sucker monkey
Sucker monkey, sucker monkey, sucker monkey, sucker monkey
Sucker monkey, sucker monkey, sucker monkeyEmbed
