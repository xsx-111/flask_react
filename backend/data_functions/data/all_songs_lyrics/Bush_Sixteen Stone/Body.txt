Body LyricsHush child - lay your sweet lips on me
This greed - bigger than you and me
Will you come again
Body
Tongue tied and a visceral third degree
Feel warm - center of gravity
Wash us all away
Body never lies
Will you come again
Will we stay friends
Oh you paralyze
Oh you paralyze
There are times when I wish
That I was you
Thick skinned - cities that you drive me through
Better than me - you're a woman
Seven days and my system is free again
We rise - lose it oblivious
Falling away - sorry for the way
Your child is on fire
Will you come again
Will we stay friends
Oh you paralyze
Oh you paralyze
Will you come again
Will we stay friends
Will you come again
Will we stay
Will we stay
Will we stay
Lick these my ruby lips
Drop your protein pills
Better just to lose yourself
We kiss we kiss we kiss
Pretty words could never say
Will you come again1Embed
