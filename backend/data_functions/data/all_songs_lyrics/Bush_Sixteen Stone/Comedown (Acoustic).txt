Comedown (Acoustic) LyricsLove and hate get it wrong
She cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day let it fade
Who was there to take your place
No one knows never will
Mostly me but mostly you
Do you say do you do
When it all comes down
Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this time to find out what I need
And I'm doing fine now
There is no blame only shame
When you beg you just complain
The more I come the more I try
All police are paranoid
So am I so's the future
So are you be a creature
Do you say do you do
When it all comes down
Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this time to find out what I need
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this all this...
Love and hate get it wrong
Cut me right back down to size
Sleep the day just let it fade
Who was there to take your place
No one knows never will
Mostly me but mostly you
Do you say do you do
When it all comes down
Cause I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this time to find out what I need
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
It's taken me all this all this time...
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
I don't wanna come back down from this cloud
This cloud (bisx3)1Embed
