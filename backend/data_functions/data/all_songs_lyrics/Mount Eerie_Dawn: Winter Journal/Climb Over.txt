Climb Over LyricsCome over. Climb over. Get over. Get on
Climb over the hill to where you hope to find nothing
Find it teeming with gold in the light
Be disappointed and glum
Beat yourself like a drum
Yell out, "Who stole my silent night?"
Calling Sorrow your friend, ask her where has she been?
And where does she head? Left or right?
Call Compassion in, ask him "How are your kids?
And where are you guys crawling tonight?"
Bring Hope along tell her sing you a song
Have her sing of her travels and flights
In fact, go 'head and call all travelers
Keep trying vainly to gather
Which direction things are headed and why
They won't tell you where they go
They know you they know
That you stupidly hope to evade them
They say, "You can try. You will keep trying
And you'll be right on the verge until you die
And then you'll find you will never find a place to hide."Embed
