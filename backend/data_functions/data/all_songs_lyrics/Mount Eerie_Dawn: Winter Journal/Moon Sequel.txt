Moon Sequel LyricsAnd when I talked to my friends
And found out that you're having fun
That you're swallowing life
That you're in the sun
That you're fucking around
That you're growing a new one
I bellow out my voice
I yell out loud
I have my shirt off in front of a crowd
I tell them about you, and how you're gone
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone, you're gone
But in my lying
Don't I have you in my mind the entire time?
Yeah, I can leave all the places we went
But I can't leave without my bones you bent
So I bobble along
And now it's me who's gone
And now it's me who has your fear of opening hearts
And all the false starts
We could tear hope apart
With all this deep gouging and biting back
With the way that you get all my friends in the sack
"What's left?"
I scream when I look up at night
Where the novelty has worn off of the blue moonlight
"Who cares?"
And I roll on the ground
"What gives?"
And there's no answering sound
And there's nobody around
And there my answer was found7Embed
