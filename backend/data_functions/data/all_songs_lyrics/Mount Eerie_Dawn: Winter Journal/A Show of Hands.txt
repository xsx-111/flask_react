A Show of Hands Lyrics"What do you love?"
I love it so much!
"What do you love so much?"
I love it so much!
"What do you love?"
I love it so much! It takes withholding
"What do you hide?"
Just look at my face and know that I won't tell
"What do you love?"
Know that I can't say it, for it has no name
I can't try to display it or even start to explain
"What do you want?"
Just hold out your hands
"What do you want with them?"
Just a show of hands
"What will you do?"
I love it so much. It takes withholding. It gives while holdingEmbed
