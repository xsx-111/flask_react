Goodbye Hope LyricsHello my air, goodbye Hope
Goodbye also to your ambushes
I say "goodbye Ghost"
And watch it turn to wide air
Where I shine and float
Hello darkest fear, goodbye eyes-closed
In the lonely, lonely, lonely night
In the long shadows
I fell to my knees in tears
And said "Sweet Heart, hello."
Hello my heart, and yes, goodbye Hope
You know we will go steady
Say "Goodbye" and "No"
You'll find me fanning out my warm unfolding hands
Blindly let me goEmbed
