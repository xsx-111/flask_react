See Me LyricsI was a log in the waves
Last time you saw me
End over end I was thrown
I endlessly groaned
"Hold my hand, won't someone come surf me?"
And of course no one came
You stood and watched the wash of water
Wedge me hopelessly into the sea wall
And there I stayed and quickly decayed
Then we all swapped molecules
Now with the wave of my hand
I command you to see me
I'm more like a mountain this time
Unmoving alpine decked in fog
I'm concealed in snow clouds
You're the farmer below
And if you've seen my face once
Then through twelve cloudy months
You will know I am there behind curtains
You'll know mountain light
Through thickness of night
See meEmbed
