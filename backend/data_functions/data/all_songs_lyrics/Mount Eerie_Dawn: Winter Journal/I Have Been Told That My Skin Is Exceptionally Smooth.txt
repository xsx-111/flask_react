I Have Been Told That My Skin Is Exceptionally Smooth LyricsShould there be songs?
Should my hair be long?
Should my stare be strong?
Do nightmares belong on the prairie at dawn?
Do I dare to fawn over fair-faced blonds?
Should there be bonds? To their hair I'm drawn
Should my prayers be bronzed? Are affairs so wrong?
I have been told that my skin is exceptionally smooth
But what good is that?
When to get to my heart
You have to crawl through tight tunnels of sharp rockEmbed
