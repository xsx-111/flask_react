We Squirm LyricsDo you seriously believe
That you will not be a prisoner?
Do you insistently try
Over and over to seem free in life
In the ways you treat your loves and the lives
And your troubles and fights and me?
Well let me say
Yeah, go ahead and try
But I say you will be captive along with me
We're stuck in the muck of our hearts
And the fear that we'll find that these feelings of ours
Start to seem like bars
So we squirm and sink deeper
Yes we wriggle into jail cells
But I say let feelings hold you
I say embrace your captors
I say get to know them deep
Have no news you won't hear
Have no truths you won't tear
No hope that'll you'll ever have freedom
From your tyrant heartEmbed
