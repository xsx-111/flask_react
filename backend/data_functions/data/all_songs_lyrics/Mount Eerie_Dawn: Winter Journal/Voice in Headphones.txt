Voice in Headphones Lyrics
I'll no longer hide it
Yes, you move me to tears, over and over
Every time I get it settled, you excite it
Every time I get my face dry, you sing

It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill
It's not meant to be a strife
It's not meant to be a struggle uphill

Now I know, so now I'll no longer fight it
(It's not meant to be a strife)
Come on in little floating head at the door
(It's not meant to be a struggle uphill)
Who are you? Who are you? Who has come to fill this room?
Well come on, welcome in

(It's not meant to be a strife)
(It's not meant to be a struggle uphill)

I'll no longer hide it
(It's not meant to be a strife)
Yes, the way you say it stirs me to the core
(It's not meant to be a struggle uphill)
Every time, no matter what
No matter who I think you are
Every time I hear you say "Undo" I do
(It's not meant to be a strife)
And the tears fall
(It's not meant to be a struggle uphill)
And the universe is shown
But who are you, voice in headphones?Embed
