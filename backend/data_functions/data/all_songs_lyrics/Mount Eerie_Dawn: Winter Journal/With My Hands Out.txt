With My Hands Out LyricsI want to go back across that sea
With my hands out, with my hands out
And I will rise from the water
Though I'm cold and wet, I will be clean
I want to come back from this robbery
With my hands up, with my hands up
And I will lie down and be handcuffed
Take me, I will be yours
Dripping wet
Just try and hold me
I am dripping wet and limpEmbed
