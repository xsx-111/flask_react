Moon, I Already Know LyricsMoon, I already know
I'm small on the ground
I roll around and feel menacing mountains
And old depths of sorrow dwarf me
All towering terrors of mine to cower below
I know, I know
I know already
So don't look at me like that
And then duck behind clouds
I know I'm small and that I have no idea
I know, I know, I know
Let me be dumb again
Let food drip off my chin
Let me think you're a light
Please, please let me sleep through the night
And knowing
Let me close eyesEmbed
