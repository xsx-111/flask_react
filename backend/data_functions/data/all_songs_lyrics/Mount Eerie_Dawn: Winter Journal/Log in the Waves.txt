Log in the Waves LyricsBroken hearted and sad, I walk upright;
A dumb ape in a world of dumb apes
A log in the waves
Knowing sorrow's always beside me, I walk upright
"O crown of light!" I sometimes say
"I know you're grand
But I must not forget my wife
So I hold her hand"
And with the wide-eyes sorrow brings
We see it all, like logs in the waves:
Effortless through oceans squalls
And we know storms are relentless
So so are we, we will not leave
Sadness (my wife) and I are honest with each other
And in mornings, I reach my hand under the quilt
Where she hides to tickle her feet
And at my touch, she cracks a smileEmbed
