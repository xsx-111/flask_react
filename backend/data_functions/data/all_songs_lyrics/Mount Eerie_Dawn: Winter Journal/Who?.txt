Who? Lyrics
What do I want with my life now that you're gone?
I want your ghost gone
What do I want with this wood now that it's sawn?
I want the stump gone
And the land that it grew on

Oh Black Lagoon, you have my shoe
So I go shoeless
I go muddy crawling through

What do I want with my home now that I'm gone?
I want the shades drawn
And the overgrown lawn
I would gladly abandon a limb in the trap's jaw
Just as long as I crawl on
With no trapper to call on

Thorough and true, by stem and root
I know no one now
Now I say "who?"1Embed
