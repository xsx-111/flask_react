My Burning LyricsFlame upon Flame upon Flame
Reaching out to wrap around
My reaching arm
That's how life got to be among my friends
I wanted her so bad
I waited around in a burning down house
Hoping for phone calls
Totally scalded and scarred
I woke up in a pile of ash
Grave beyond Grave beyond Grave
Stretching out to horizons
On all sides
That's how life got to be among my friends
Dead or alive I buried them all
I wanted her so bad
As revenge for my burning
I burned the whole world
And was warm for a little whileEmbed
