Fuck the People LyricsYou want a warning
You got a warning
You want a warning
You got a warning
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
You want a warning
Ya' got a warning
Stab your back
You want a warning
You got a warning
Stab your back
You want a warning
You got a warning
Stab your back
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
You want a warning
You got a warning
Stab your back
Hey, fuck the people
Hey, fuck the people
Last moon a cigarette
Hang myself on a tree
Laughin' at another on a funny thing
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
You want a warning
You got a warning
Stab your back
Hey, fuck the people
Hey, fuck the people
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
You want a warning
You got a warning
Stab your back
Last moon a cigarette
Hang myself on a tree
Laughing at another on a funny thing
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
Bet you something I can get your mouth shut
You want a warning
You got a warning
Stab your back
Hey, fuck the people
Hey, fuck the people
Fuck the people
Fuck the peopleEmbed
