Sugar Baby LyricsGot no sugar baby now;
It's all I can do for to see peace with you
And I can't get along this a-way
Oh, i can't get along this a-way
All I can do, all I can say;
Gonna send you to your mama next payday
Send you to your mama next payday
Who'll rock the cradle, who'll sing the song
Who'll rock the cradle when I'm gone
Who'll rock the cradle when I'm gone?
I'll rock the cradle, I'll sing the song
I'll rock the cradle when you're gone
I'll rock the cradle when you're gone
Oh I've got no honey baby now;
Oh I've got no honey baby now;
I got no sugar baby now
Said all I can say, all I can do
And I can't make a living with you
Can't make a living with youEmbed
