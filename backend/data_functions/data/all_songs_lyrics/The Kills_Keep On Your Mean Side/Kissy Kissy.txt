It's been a long time coming
I'm gonna stab your kissy, kissy mouth
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
I'm gonna stab your kissy kissy heart
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
I'm gonna burn your kissy, kissy claw
It's been a long time coming
I'm gonna burn your kissy kissy claw
I'm gonna stab your kissy kissy heart
I'm gonna stab your kissy kissy mouth
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
I'm gonna stab your kissy kissy mouth
I'm gonna stab your kissy kissy mouth
I'm gonna stab your kissy kissy mouthEmbed
