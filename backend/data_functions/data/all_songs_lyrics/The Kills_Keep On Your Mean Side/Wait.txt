Wait LyricsTell me what you've done to yourself
I would like to know
Write it on the rocks and then
Tell me where to go
Why you say wait
Wait
Tell me you're the lucky one
How fast you can throw
Tell me all the things you've done
I would like to know
Why you say wait
Why
Tell me how you like yourself
Tell me how you go
Unlike you were someone else, now
I want to know
Why you say wait
Why you say
Oh wait
La la la la la la la
Why you say
La la la la, la la la la
Why you say wait
La la la la la la la
Why you say
La la la la, la la la la
Why you say wait
So tell me something bad you've done
Tell me bout your ghost
Tell me bout the game you won
And the one who lost
Why you say wait
Wait
Tell me bout your magic touch
Every coin you toss
The cat get out, the dog get in
That's how it's always been
Why you say wait
Why
Now tell me what's so funny, man
Tell me, what'd I miss?
Write it on the rocks and then
Tell me how it is
Why you say wait
Why
Why you say
Oh wait
La la la la la la la
Why you say
La la la la, la la la la
Why you say wait
La la la la la la la
Why you say
La la la la, la la la la
Why you say wait
La la la la la la la
Why you say
La la la la, la la la la
Why you say wait
Why you say
It's not worth saving, when you say wait
Why you say
It's not worth saving, when you say wait
Why you say wait
It's not worth saving, when you say wait
Why you say
It's not worth saving, when you say wait
Why you say wait
Why
Nothing
When you say
Hmm
NothingEmbed
