Hand LyricsI called her yesterday and she told me ummm that uhh
Well, she was just talking me about the weather man on television
And I'd thought you'd be interested in knowing about this
It's pretty interesting, but well uhh well
Before they actually put the weather man on the television with the weather board
They just put the weather man's hand pointing to stuff
And sometimes ummm they drew on the boards like they would draw cc hmm cc clouds as rain
And hmm sometimes they would draw mm maybe hmm lightning
And hmm and sometimes hmm sun if it was gonna' be sunny
But the thing that they did the weather man had to get get to the station early because umm
There was...uhhh they had to get make-up put on their handEmbed
