Dropout Boogie LyricsYou wanna do what, you wanna do what
I told you what, I told you what
You wanna do what, you wanna do what
I told you what, I told you what
Go to school, go to school
Just take, just take
Dropout, dropout
You getta job, you getta job
Dunno whattit, dunno whattit
What it's all about, what it's all about
You told her ya love her, so bring her the butter
You love her adapt her, you love her adapt her
Adapt her adapter, adapt her adapter
What about after that, what about after that
Support her, support her
She says she's no boarder
Getta job, getta job
You gotta support her
You told her you loved her
So bring her the butter
You love her adapt her
You love her adapt her
Adapt her adapterEmbed
