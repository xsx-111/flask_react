Black Rooster LyricsYou want to cuss and fight
In the basement
The kid want to cuss and fight
In the basement
Warm black rooster worn white hand
The young kids got my name
You like to cuss and fight
In the basement
The kid want to cuss and fight
In the basement
Got a rattle snake on in the basement
The young snake's got my name
You wanna swing that hand
In the basement
The kid wanna swing that hand
In the basement
Drop your medicine, six white sons
The young snake's got my name
You want to cuss and fight
In the basement
The kid want to cuss and fight
In the basement
Got a rattle snake on in the basement
The young snake's got my name
I'm not coming home again
I'm not coming home again
I'm not coming home again
I'm not coming home again
You want to fuck and fight
In the basement
The kid wanna fuck and fight
In the basement
Got a rattle snake on in the basement
The young snake's got my name
You want to fuck and fight
In the basement
The kid like to fuck and fight
In the basement
Got a rattle snake, six white sons
The young kid's got my name
I'm not coming home again
I'm not coming home again
I'm not coming home again
I'm not coming home again
You want to cuss and fight
In the basement
The kid want to cuss and fight
In the basement
Got a rattle skate on in the basement
The young snake's got my nameEmbed
