Pull a U LyricsPull a u in a sexy car
Got your black magic
And your two dollar
Pull a u in ya dust dusty car
Got your black magic
And your two dollar love
Pull a u with your sexy (?)
Got your black magic
And your two dollar love
Pull a u honey, and get me too
I'm your black magic
And your two dollar, go right
I'm not trying to wake you up
I'm not trying to wake you up
Don't clean it up
Don't lean it back
Get on the hood
Ain't nothing to lose
Sit at your two dollar love
They pull the string on everything
Your black magic
And your two dollar love, go right
I'm not trying to wake you up
I'm not trying to wake you up
I'm not trying to wake you up
I'm not trying to wake you up
Black magic and your two dollar love
Black magic and your two dollar love
Black magic and your two dollar love
Black magic and your two dollar love
Go rightEmbed
