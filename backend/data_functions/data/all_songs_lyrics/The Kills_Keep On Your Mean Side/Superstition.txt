Superstition LyricsSuperstition is
Your modern eye
With original skin
And original lie
Your modern shell
Wants to feed itself
You got elected now honey so
What the hell
Superstition is
Your modern eye
With original skin
And original lie
Your modern shell
Wants to kill itself
You got elected now honey so
What the hell
Superstition is
Your modern eye
With original skin
And original lie
Your modern shell
Wants to feed itself
You got elected now honey so
What the hellEmbed
