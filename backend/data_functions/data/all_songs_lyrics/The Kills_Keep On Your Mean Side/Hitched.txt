Hitched LyricsDon't you leave me here
Don't you leave me here
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get hitched
Get back, get by
Get a room, give me 105
Don't lie, don't care
Don't answer if you call me there
Don't you leave me here
Don't you leave me here
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get hitched
Lay down by the road
Black rocks and a can of holes
Gone four, gone five
Sweating, cussing on the mean side
Don't you leave me here
Don't you leave me here
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get
Hitched
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get
Hitched
Sit tight, getting by
Got a room, got my 10-5
Say it son, get gone
Smiling, all like a dead-eyed dog
Don't you leave me here
Don't you leave me here
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get
Hitched
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get
Get my name stitched on your lips so you won't get
Hitched
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean side
Keep, keep on your mean sideEmbed
