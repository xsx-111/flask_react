Cat Claw Lyrics
It's time to stand dull fingers, and the band
Tell me sugar how you felt, c'mon sugar, tell now
Stand your face until it's soot, on fire
Won't keep up with the law, it's such a long walk

If this all goes well you won't have nothing
So tell you dead wrong, dead wrong
And now you're long gone
Hang out for minute and rethink
Question, tell me what she done
Just one, 'cause I can't see nothin'

So, one, two and

You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Got my hand caught in a cat claw, scream
Everyone's that time looks around, they're talkin' trees, you know
Never know who's comin', might easily be me, you know
Give up for my love 'cause that's too much, fuck

So, one, two and

You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It's time to stand dull fingers, and the band
Tell me sugar how you felt, c'mon sugar, tell now
Stand your face until it's soot, on fire
Won't keep up with the law, it's such a long walk
So, one, two and

You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want it
You got it, I want itEmbed
