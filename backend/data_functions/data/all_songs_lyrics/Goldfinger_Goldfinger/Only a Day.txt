Only a Day LyricsAs I look out outside
I can see the rain about to start
The air is damp but warm
And I remember how you used to feel
And I see your face
My cold reflection scares me at this hour
How I wish I could sleep
If only I could slow my mind a bit
(Chorus)
Then when I see you I forget the pain
And melt away with you
Only a day is passed and
I can't help but feel that I've lost you
Your room confines my thoughts
And then my worries drift when I'm with you
But I don't want to live
I never know just when we'll meet again
Chorus
What is it that feeds this
Haven't I learned enough from yesterday
I really don't need this
Haven't I had enough of this today
Then I sit at home
My walls reflect how my life is so bleak
And I feel so alone
I break down and call you 'cuz I'm weak
If I can see what you are
If I could blow away my clouded sight
Realize you made me a fool
If I mean nothing what else can I say
Chorus
I've lost you
I've lost youEmbed
