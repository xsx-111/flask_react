Miles Away LyricsHow deep is your love?
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the sea?
And how deep is my love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the sea?
And how deep is my love?
It's miles away
Miles away
Miles away
Yeah miles away
How much do you want?
And how far can I take you?
How bad does this hurt?
How much do I want you?
How blind can I be?
So when can I see you?
Will it ever be?
And how deep is my love?
It's miles away
Miles away
Miles away
Yeah miles away
It's miles away
Miles away
Miles away
Yeah miles away
Let's go
It's miles away
Miles away
Miles away
Yeah miles awayEmbed
