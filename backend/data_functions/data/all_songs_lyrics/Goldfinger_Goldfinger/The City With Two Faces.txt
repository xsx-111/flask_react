The City With Two Faces LyricsFuck L.A

I tried once to be civil
But I just got put on hold
I'm sick of hearing complaints
The espresso is too cold
You act like you're a friend
But then you talk 'bout how we suck
Just save it for your dildo
That's the only thing you'll fuck

If I was smart, I'd run fast (out of this town)
Sometimes I want to shout and scream
Fuck L.A

Traded your Doc Martens
In exchange for cowboy boots
You're asking who's Keith Morris
Yeah, you're punk rock
Where's your roots
You're a rocker, you're a biker
You're punk rock, now you skate
Last year it was Zeppelin
Now it's Bad Brains
You're a fake
If I was smart, I'd run fast (out of this town)
Sometimes I want to shout and scream
Fuck L.A
I fucking know what I'm talking about, fuckers

Now don't get me wrong
You're probably thinking
We're just some trendy punk-rock band jumping on the band wagon
Like, how many times have you heard me say 'fuck' anyway?
Seven to be exact, and we still have four more to go
Now I know L.A.'s got some beautiful people
It's also got some great bands
NOFX, Bad Religion....
Hell, I owe my life to this city
But I have had more motorcycles stolen here
Than Nirvana has songs about heroin
You can't really surf unless you want to get hepatitis
Wait a Second!

If I was smart, I'd run fast (out of this town)
Sometimes I want to shout and scream
Fuck
If I was smart, I'd run fast (out of this town)
Sometimes I want to shout and scream
Fuck L.A
Fuck L.A
Fuck L.A
Fuck it!Embed
