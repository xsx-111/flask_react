Answers LyricsI searched for a cause
I climbed the highest mountain
I walked to the top
I stopped and then looked down
But when i stop the search
The answers always come
And when i help someone
I always help myself by helping
---chorus---
You tell me where your skeleton's hiding
Tell me all and i'll tell you
You think you have a real good fucking answer
A fucking answer i'll give you
I look towards the girls
And there i found no truth
I looked outside myself
It seemed i lost the good
But when i turn my eyes
Out from my own head
That's when i realise
That i see what i'm really sellingEmbed
