Stay LyricsWell if I'm sorry
Does that mean I have to change
'cuz change does scare me
I'd like to know how I would feel
And if you'll have me
I won't leave or make you hurt
'cuz I need you
And I hope you'll let me
Stay - ay - ay
Let me stay
You'll let me stay - ay - ay
Let me stay
So when I see you
Please understand the way I think
Your smile it heals me
I never want to go away
Believe I love you
No matter how selfish I get
I know you'll help me
The way I feel I won't forget
You'll let me stay
You'll let me stay - ay - ay
Let me stay
I feel cold sometimes
I turn my faith to fear
I seem so lost sometimes
Can you find it?
Can you find it?
And if I'm sorry
Does that mean I have to change
'cuz change does scare me
I'd like to know how I would feel
And if you'll have me
I won't leave or make you hurt
'cuz I need you
And I hope you'll let me
Stay - ay - ay
Let me stay
You'll let me stay - ay - ay
Let me stay
You'll let me stay - ay - ay
Let me stay
You'll let me stay - ay - ay
Let me stayEmbed
