King For A Day LyricsRunnin' twice as fast I see
You're getting sick again
You're runnin' faster all the time
If i could I'll take it away
You know I would
Making plans to rule the world wooo
Spread yourself way too thin wooo
Wishing that you were king
Is killing you...
Denyng that you're just a man wooo
Just makes you tire out wooo
You've got to slow it down
You're always running
And if I write this song to you
Would you listen up?
Cause this is your life
Is not mine
If I could I'll take it away
You know I would
Making plans to rule the world woao
Spread yourself way too thin woao
Wishing that you were king
Is killing you...
Denying that you're just a man woao
Just makes you tire out woao
You've got to slow it down
You're allways running
Making plans to rule the world woao
Spread yourself way too thin woao
Wishing that you were king
Is killing you...
Yeah!
Runnin' twice as fast I see
You're getting sick again
You're runnin' faster all the time
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If i could I'll take it away
You know I would
Making plans to rule the world woao
Spread yourself way too thin woao
Wishing that you were king
Is killing you...
Denying that you're just a man woao
Just makes you tire out woao
You've got to slow it down
You're allways running
Making plans to rule the world
You're allways runnin'...Embed
