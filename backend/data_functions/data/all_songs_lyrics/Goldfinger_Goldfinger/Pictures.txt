Pictures LyricsHere I am alone again
It seems like you're never there
I told myself so many times
I'd make it on my own
So here I am and you're not
Here I am alone
All I want is a picture for me to look at
And all I need, for me to look at you when you're not there
I'm lost again and I found you
I'm so glad you're here
I can't believe I deserve you
Just thought I'd let you know
So here I am and you're not
Here I am alone
All I want is a picture for me to look at
And all I need; for me to look at you when you're not there6Embed
