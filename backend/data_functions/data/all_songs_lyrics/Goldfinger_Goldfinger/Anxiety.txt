Anxiety LyricsSo you've be thinkin' about it
You think that you've got the answer now
And you've been praying about it
You've asked him to remove your fearright now
So you analyze it you think you have control
Then you realize
It's time that you let go
(Chorus)It's not your time
Yeah. Feel it all and know
It's not your time, yeah
Feel it all and know that this will pass
So you can cry about it
The tears can help you heal inside
I know you lost your mind now
And you just tell yourself to hide
So you analyze it, you think you have control
Then you realize
It's time that you let go. (Chorus)
Feel it all and know
It's not your time, yeah
Feel it all and know that this will pass
ChorusChorus
It's not your time, yeah
Feel it all and knowit's not your time, yeah
Feel it all and know that this will pass.Yeah
Yeah.Know it's not your time
Know it's not your time, yeah, yeahEmbed
