Here in Your Bedroom LyricsHere in your bedroom
I can turn my head off
The less that I feel
Is the less that I'm on top
I wonder what you think
As we lay here in bed
I don't know what I'm thinking
But that's better for my head
When I wake up tomorrow
Will you still feel the same?
When I wake up tomorrow
Will you have changed?
'Cuz I still feel the same
'Cuz I still feel the same
I, 'cuz I still feel the same
Here in your bedroom
I can turn my head off
The less that I feel
Is the less that I'm on top
I wonder what you think
As we lay here in bed
I don't know what I'm thinking
But that's better for my head
When I wake up tomorrow
Will you still feel the same?
When I wake up tomorrow
Will you have changed?
'Cuz I still feel the same
'Cuz I still feel the same
I, 'cuz I still feel the same
One, Two!
Here in your bedroom
I feel safe from the outside
I can tell that you're changing
But still I feel so high
I wonder what you think
Sometimes I feel so old
I don't know if it's worth it
When I just do what I'm told
When I wake up tomorrow
Will you still feel the same?
When I wake up tomorrow
Will you have changed?
'Cuz I still feel the same
'Cuz I still feel the same
I, 'cuz I still feel the same
I, 'cuz I still feel the same
I, I still feel the same
Won't you?6Embed
