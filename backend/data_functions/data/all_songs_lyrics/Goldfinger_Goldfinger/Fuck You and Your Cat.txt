Fuck You and Your Cat LyricsO-O-o-O-o
The night is chilly as the stars above
The things you said that day made me feel loved
To smell your hair and feel you in my arms
How I trusted you and let myself go
Now its gone away so lo-ong so long
Pictures in my head of what could never be
You cut me off you let me down you lied to me
I take you out I rub you down I sell you shoes
So fuck your trust your perfume and your mother too
Wheres my t-shirt wheres my money
Fuck you and your catEmbed
