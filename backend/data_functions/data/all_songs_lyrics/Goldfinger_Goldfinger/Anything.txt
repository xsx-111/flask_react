Anything LyricsAll the time you still ask me questions
You love to fill me up with emptiness
I'm a martyr in search of a party
I'm a lover in search of a quest
(Chorus)
I can see that you don't want anything
I can see sometimes you don't want me
So just love me the times that I need you
I can say then that I am still free
Free
So you want to walk to the ocean
The water, it breaks hard against the stone
The silhoutte of you in the moonlight
Sends chills dancing right to my heart
