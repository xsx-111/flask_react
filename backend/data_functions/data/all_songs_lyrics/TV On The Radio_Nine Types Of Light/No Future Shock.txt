No Future Shock Lyrics
Yeah, burned up all your credit
On a family of kids who pop your pills
And smoke your pipe
And after the war, broke your piggy bank
Ah, the bastards broke the world this time
So we sleep with our guns
And no jive won't get done
But we're heavy and high
Oh, stuck in the middle of a silly little riddle
Control your damn control till it blows your mind

Oh dance, don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future
Oh, you're aware, blow your top
Oh, do the no future, do the no future
Oh you're aware, blow your top
Oh, do the no future, do the no future

Oh Mother dear, did they really cop a feel
Before they robbed you blind?
We're all lacking nourishment
We searched around the world
Looks like a man's gone drop
Oh, tell, tell, tell me, baby girl
Born into this burning world, are you ready?
Here comes the cop to lock us up for smoking crack
Well, 
Blow mountaintops, are you, ah, ready?

Oh dance, don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future

 honey and it's burning blood money
So I leave the motor running all night
Absurdities confirming me like want 'me, start 'me up
Cause here, funny, it just doesn't seem right
(So tight)
Is this where we thought we'd be
Pass it in the fishery, clean water running out of sight
Come on, come on, don't you sleep
See the whores and fishermen
Feel it when you're next to me, know the woman generally
Oh drop and bounce
And shake it, shake it like it is the end of time
Oh see that you get down in the town
In the country, in the city, in the middle of the village
Don't get left behind

Oh, work it out, your thoughts, let's shout
You're bleeding things so full of love, get ready
Well, a father to the mother
"Tell us what went wrong?"
I can't stay, no one lives too long
Hold it steady, girl, it falls apart

Don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future shock
Don't stop
Oh, do the no future, do the no future shockEmbed
