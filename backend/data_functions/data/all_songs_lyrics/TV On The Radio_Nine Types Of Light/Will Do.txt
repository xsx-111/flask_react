Will Do Lyrics
It might be impractical to seek out a new romance
We won't know the actual if we never take the chance
I'd love to collapse with you and ease you against this song
I think we're compatible; I see that you think I'm wrong, but

Any time will do
My love
Any time will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Any time will do
My love
Any time will do
What choice of words will take me back to you?
Oh-oh, oh, oh

Your love makes a fool of you; you can't seem to understand
A heart doesn't play by rules, and love has its own demands
But I'll be there to take care of you if ever you should decide
That you don't want to waste your life in the middle of a lovesick lullaby, but

Any time will do
My love
Any time will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Any time will do
My love
Any time will do
The choicest words will take me back to you
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, my reddest rose, caldera
Set it off
How your fire grows, hermosa, caldera
Glistening
Through your fuséd blows, cariño, caldera
Set it off
As your body flows, the second hand flashes
Passes
Over your skin like time

Any time will do
My love
Any time will do
My love
Any time will do
My love
Any time will do
My love
Any time will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Any time will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Any time will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Any time will do
No choice of words will break me from this rule
Anytime will do
What choice of words will take me back to you?
Oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh4Embed
