Second Song Lyrics
Confidence and ignorance approved me
Define my day today
I've tried so hard to shut it down, lock it up
Gently walk away
Appetites and impulses confuse me
Decide my day, today
Now my body says it's over
Shaking hands move to tear my face away
And when the night comes I'm fiending like a pyro
And I know stables my survival
When there's music all around me and I haven't got a single word to say
And then the light shines
It's gleaming like a bottle
And lord knows I tackled it full throttle
May I illuminate the nameless faceless saints of this out and open grace

Every lover on a mission shift your known position into the light
Every diamond elemental you are instrumental to the light
Every sonic evolution make your contribution to the light
Every lover on a mission shift your known position to the light

Oh body mine please leave behind
And I'll do you one better
While you define
Your heartless time
I'll defend my love forever
Every lover on a mission shift your known position into the light
Every diamond elemental you are instrumental to the light
Every sonic evolution make your contribution to the light
Every glorious disaster
Every bond is going to bring you faster out into the light, light2Embed
