New Cannonball Blues Lyrics
Hey girls hey boys no don't mind the noise
It's just the sound of being dragged ahead
It's just a pornographic annulation ship
As we watch the spider's web eat itself
All this death above extinguishing
All that you've ever known
Turn your touch screens off and start harvesting
The seeds that your parents sow

It's got me singing blues that hit you like a cannonball
Loud enough to break your bones
But it was written in blood before they wrote it in stone
So sing it with me like it's your own

It's got me fucked up and dried up
And fed up can't get up
And bleeding and crying
Like I'm mad at the soul
I'm a carbon copy
Now they got me
Up oh look at where we're going
It's got you strung out and bothered
And caught up and drowning
And failing and shot up
And feeling you got to run
You're a carbon copy
Now they got me
Up oh look at where we're going
You're getting bothered staying low like under four hundred blows
Makes you feel like you are all by yourself
So when the chance comes along like where you could help right a wrong
The bullshit's got you stuck up on the shelf
But it's heavy
I'm not ready
Do you feel like you're swimming in the notes?
But baby follow the sound
That's shooting out of your crown
There's only one way up from the floor

It's got me fucked up and dried up
And fed up can't get up
And bleeding and crying
Like I'm mad at the soul
I'm a carbon copy
Now they got me
Up oh look at where we're going
It's got you strung out and bothered
And caught up and drowning
And failing and shot up
And feeling you got to run
You're a carbon copy
Now they got me
Up oh look at where we're going
Not gonna tiptoe
Going to run right forward
Lord not the first time we've imposed a locked door
Oh critter fight back it's your sole reward
Below with your fist up
Brush the dust off
Boy it's got got
It's got me singing

Blues that hit you like a cannonball
Loud enough to break your bones
But it was written in blood before they wrote it in stone
So sing it with me like it's your own

Those blues they hit you like a cannonball
Loud enough to break your bones
But wish the rising in love before we're taking the throne
So sing it with me like it's your own

You better dust off and get up
Get ready to push up
Hey baby get ready
'Cause yeah yeah it's going to come
If you want to see
What's possible for
Ah a better way right now
You better dust off and get up
Get ready to push up
Hey baby get ready
'Cause yeah yeah it's going to come
When the truth is spoken
Love's unbroken
Nothing's going to weigh us downEmbed
