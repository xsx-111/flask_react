You Lyrics
You
Gave no reason for letting go
I just thought you might like to know
You're the only one I ever loved
True
We've demolished a thing or two
But it seemed like the thing to do
And you're the only one I ever loved

Comes to know
Though the feelings were half where we lied
Comes to be wrong
In our dreams we were making it right

But you
Threw your hands up and walked away
Seems strange I could feel this way
You're the only one I ever loved

Comes to know
Though the feelings were half where we lied
Comes to be wrong
Though the secrets were safer at night
Come, sugar, home
Stow your feedback and take it inside
Cross your heart
In our dreams we were making it right

But you
Threw your hands up and walked away
Seems strange I could feel this way
You're the only one I ever lovedEmbed
