Repetition Lyrics
To arrive ahead of its time
Is the fate of the fish washed up on shore
Do you know that he just won't feel right
Till he's swallowed up by the tide
Thought it might know better
Born into capital lifestyle heights
Got a head full of fever and it feels all right
Cause I shake my bottle and I suck my swill
And I love how I'm living cause I've got my fill
But I can't stop thinking how it's all gone wrong
And the cracks will be obvious before too long
I've abused my position and it cost my friends
And if the world keeps turning I could do it again

What's the matter with your next-door neighbor
I heard he had sex, drugs and danger
But you can kick it with a complete stranger
I think I hear him calling
What's the matter with your next-door neighbor
An act of man, a freak of nature
You've been kicking with a complete stranger
I think I hear him calling now

And the time on your hands is a walk in the park
If it don't then I hope you can see in the dark (real hard)
Hail Mary, watch your life unfold
I'm a man on a mission or so I've been told
I can choose my victims, I could shed my skin
And if the world keeps turning I could do it again
But I can't stop thinking that it's all gone wrong
And the truth will be obvious before too long
I've abused my position and it cost my friends
If the world keeps turning I might do it again
What's the matter with your next-door neighbor
I heard he had sex, drugs and danger
But you can kick it with a complete stranger
I think I hear him calling
What's the matter with your next-door neighbor
An act of god, a freak of nature
You've been kicking with a complete stranger
I think the curtain's falling down

We lock eyes and walk away unrecognized
We lock arms and spin
Commence our repetition

My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is this
My repetition, my repetition is thisEmbed
