Keep Your Heart Lyrics
In the dark of the night I found
Without my love, my love
These words are not a bit profound
If it's just another cheap line flung
Outside ecstatic love
What did we think we'd find?
Over that broken road
Out past the land mines

I'm going to keep your heart
I'm going to keep your heart
With the world all falling apart
I'm going to keep your heart
Can I coax it out its shell
Brush the dust off
Get its wings on
In this little bell
We will also feel the singing, oh
Shine on, light of love
On all these bruises and scars
Ruins in every less
But it can't cancel out the stars
Dropped all your clothes and life
Wonder who won mine
Kneeling above this playful body
Teach Superman to fly

How'm I gonna keep your heart?
How'm I gonna keep your heart?
If the world all falls apart
How'm I gonna keep your heart?
Time alone will tell
If you're the kind who keeps the veil on
Biding time will tell us
When and if to sail on
All these blues I have cried
Seem to have come undone
Tried all the new designs
Still ended up in love

Still we're kind of shy
You've nothing to be ashamed of
Though its hard to tell
If I'll ever feel the same love
I'm gonna keep your heart
I'm gonna keep your heart
If the world all falls apart
Still, I'm gonna keep your heartEmbed
