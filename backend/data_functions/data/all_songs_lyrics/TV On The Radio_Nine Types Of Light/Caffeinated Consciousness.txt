Caffeinated Consciousness Lyrics
Now drop yourself
With no concern
On how to breathe
When your mind is burned
On optimistic
On overload
Can we shift the heat back
To when your heart's grown cold
In severed light
Our souls are damaged
And with that caged
To the cause of light
Now I can see
Another language
Gone optimistic
We're going to survive

We're the tail-end of the sun
To a greener hideaway
Where in peace I found my fun
Till I heard the future say

I'm in an army
A mega quake
A force of nature
All hell will shake
Improve our days now
'Cause we might not sleep tonight
Suffused are we
To the cause of light
On optimistic
On overload
Can we shift the heat back
To when your heart's grown cold
And now we know why
And know what we must do
Aware of the cracks
The heart shines through
We're the tail-end of the sun
To a greener hideaway
Where in peace I found my fun
Till I heard the future say

We're the tail-end of the sun
To a greener hideaway
Where in peace I found my fun
Until I heard the future

(Would you ever believe my life was so
Fine so fine so fine and fine)
A bed of roses
And roller coasters
(Would you ever believe my life was life was so
Fine so fine so fine and on)
A bed of roses
And roller coasters
(Would you ever believe my life was so fine so fine
Fine so fine so fine so fine)
A bed of roses
And roller coasters
(Would you ever believe my life was life was all
Right all right all right all right)
A bed of roses
And roller coastersEmbed
