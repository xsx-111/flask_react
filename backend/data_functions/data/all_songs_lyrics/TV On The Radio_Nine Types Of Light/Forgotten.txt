Forgotten Lyrics
Beverly Hills, burning off plastic
Scrape it away, I do, I may
For the summer
For the summer

Here goes your man, dances the hourly
Cape land to colors rolling through the valley
For the summer
For the summer

Hold tight, horizon minds
It's writing its name in the sky
It's paradise
We fade away into the night

Beverly Hills, nuclear winter
What should we wear and who's for dinner
In the summer
For the summer

Hold tight, our love will fade out
It's writing its name in the sky
And I'll stop and stare
We'll fade away into the night
It's paradise
For now we go under the knife
For one time, oh some doctors
Divided by night time

Let's do it in the summer, send for the sunrise
Let's do it in the summer, send for the sunrise
Let's do it in the summer, send for the sunrise
Let's do it in the summer, send for the sunrise1Embed
