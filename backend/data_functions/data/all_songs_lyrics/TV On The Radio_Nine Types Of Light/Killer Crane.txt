Killer Crane Lyrics
After the rain
A killer crane
After the rainbow
Across the sky
Her grace's glide
Across the sea
Across creation
And over time
Her gracious life
Escapes its station
A cold wind blows
The day bestows
Glum proclamation
Leave it behind
Your restless mind
Your jealousies
But isolation
Demands your patience
To be found together in time just to say

Sunshine I saw you through the hanging vine
A memory of what is mine fading away
But this night heals the ground
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid
And after all
We're free to fall
Once all the pain goes
And how we stood
And what was good
Could lie us all long
In isolation
A transformation
Blue laughter leaves me
Leaves me blue
Emboldened on to see it through
This life of love and lighting go
A killer crane
After a rainbow
May they found together in time just to say

Sunshine, I saw you through the hanging vine
A memory of what was mine fading away
But this night heals the ground
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid
Sunshine, come crawling through the hanging vines
A memory of what was mine fading away
But this night heals the ground
And the moonlight steals the sound
I could leave suddenly unafraid
Sunshine, I saw you through the hanging vine
All memories of what was mine fading away
But this night heals the ground
And the moonlight steals the sound
I can leave suddenly unafraidEmbed
