Knees Lyrics
Knees hurt me when I grow
And that's a tough pill to swallow
Because I'm not gettin' taller
Please, is there any way I could grow, please?
My knees hurt when I grow
And that's a tough pill to swallow (I ain't felt that in like a decade)
Because I'm not getting taller (Can we press rewind and just go ahead and press play)
Please, is there any way I can grow, please?
My knees hurt when I grow
And that's a tough pill to swallow (I ain't felt that in like a decade)
'Cause I'm not gettin' taller (Can we press rеwind and just go ahead and press play)
Pleasе, is there any way I could grow, please?
Ah

Take that, take that, take that, that, take that
Take my payment, baby, just take that
She said "We don't accept the swipey kind"
I think these niggas might be lyin'
Shit, we ain't up to speed on that
Nah, we ain't got the green like that
Oh, my signature don't match on that?
I did that when snapbacks came back
Lost in the tint, there was things I ain't rolling with
Things I ain't knowing yet, things I ain't growing in
Oh, don't worry, you gon' grow into those, baby
Go ahead, just try 'em on, just, put 'em on man, let's, and let's see
Grandma, I don't, I don't think I'm growin' anymore

I don't think I'll grow no more
I don't think it'll snow no more
Don't feel it in my bones no more
I ain't too cool for, oh, no more
I ain't up to speed like that
I been out the loop for sure
Hold up, shit, I'll be right back
Instructions in the trash for sure
Yeah

Shit, I can't even grow no more
Well, at least not vertically
But all these bottles that a nigga been killin'
Got my stomach a lil' bit lower than it's supposed to be, 'posed to be
Shit, I seen my aunt the other day, she started roastin' me
Like "Baby, how come every time I see you, you gettin' pound in the face?"
Had some rude l shit I'd want to write her, then I thought about it
I should probably take this booze off my rider
Okay, this last one is my last one, shit
Probably said that about the last one
Probably gon' say it about the next two
Well fuck it nigga, at least my dreads grew
Watch me swang on 'em, yeah
Watch me, watch me
My knees hurt 'cause I'm growin'
And that's a tough pill to swallow
'Cause I'm not, I'm not gettin' taller
(Oh, this is you, nah, go ahead, that's you, go ahead)
Keep on killin' these bottles, these bottles
Knees hurt, my knees hurt 'cause I'm growin'
And that's a tough pill to swallow
Stop killin' these bottles
My knees hurt, my knees hurt 'cause I'm growin'
And that's the tough pill to swallow
I need to put down the bottle
My knees hurt, knees hurt 'cause I'm grown
And that's a tough pill to swallow11Embed
