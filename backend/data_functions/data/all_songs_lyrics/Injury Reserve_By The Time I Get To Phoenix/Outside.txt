Outside Lyrics
I make my presence felt
A OG once told me, tie a rope around his neck
'Cause you gotta give people enough room to hang themself
I had to learn to feed myself
Is it wealth or health?
Cause for wealth, you gon' lose your health
Smack, I got the .40 on my belt
Blow your brains on your body
"Fuck that mean?"
Maybe you should think for yourself

Let me talk to 'em
I been—I been talking to 'em kindly
Walk with it, walk with it, yeah
(It's mean, talk to 'em)
Walk with it, walk with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Don't let these niggas backpedal)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I been, talk to 'em kindly, walk, walk, w-walking with it prolly
I came in a little too sharp, oh you ain't like that
You ain't like it when I come in all wile, yeah
Let me, let me tell you something
I been talkin' to 'em kindly
Cause they wanna toot each others' horns
Pat each other's backs for anything in common, even slightly
Oh, you wanna meet in the middle, huh?
You wanna see what we have in common? Yeah
Take a seat, sit right across from me, don't sit behind 'em
So you can just, you can just stalk on him, probably listen—
Let's cut all that bullshit
What's the elephant in the room? Let's talk to him, c'mon
Let's talk to him, don't hide it, yeah
With all that walking in circles
You thought it was gonna be a walk in the park with it probably
But now you—you walking in bark
"But I would've—!", with all that, "Should've, could've, would've—"
I'm in your neck of the woods with dogs
Ready to bark on 'em, prowling
Tryna big-dog me? You can't lil-bro me
Like I'm 34 miles from Raleigh
The r-slash got the white boys talking all wildly
Like they about to—get 'em, get to cocking on 'em
With all that—all the white noise you talking
You off the wall with the cocking: Macaulay Culkin
You better step with caution around him
Get out the yellow tape and get ready to chalk and outline 'em
Cause their past about to start stalkin' 'em prolly
Tip-toe, tip-toe, bout to stalk on em proudly
Get to, get to talking to 'em quietly
As we walk
As we walk through this valley of death
Listen, please listen, listen, listen
Y'all wanna have two-way conversations
Y'all wanna have two-way conversations
But let's put everything on the table, let's put everything
We ain't gonna bounce around it
Nah, we ain't gonna bounce around shit
Got my skeletons, you've got yours
But let's be honest here
This-this don't end with agree to disagree, it ain't possible
There's just some things
There's just some things that ain't right
We've gotta be honest with ourselves
Now I know, I-I know, I know you know, I know, I know
And if you don't, then there's something wrong
Up here in your noggin, in your noggin
We cannot end this with an agree to disagree
There is no happy medium
That is nothing, that is nothing
Yeah, yeah7Embed
