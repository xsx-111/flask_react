Bye Storm Lyrics
Damn, nigga, it really, uh
It rains, it pours, but, damn, nigga, it really
Bye storm
I know, I know, I'll mourn
Yeah, won't show everything
The show must go on, the show must go
Man, show must go on, shit I don't know
It rains, it pours, but, damn, nigga, it's really pourin'
It rains, it pours, but, damn, nigga, it's really pourin'

Shit, we got caught by storm and we ain't even know it
To you, this shit knee high, to him, it's to his shoulders
I seen what gravity did to my Pop's shell, it broke me
I told my cuz that ain't him, she said, "Shit, I know that"
I seen my anchors break down, I don't know how to hold that
There's only so much two arms can truly hold, man
Everybody got that one that keep the rest in orbit
But who gon' hold it down when that rock can't take no more, man?
It rains, it pours, but, damn, man, it's really pourin'
They said you'll cope, but, damn, man, shit, I don't know, man
We laugh, we joke 'cause, man, that's just how they'd want it
It rains, it pours, but, damn, nigga, it's really pourin'5Embed
