Ground Zero Lyrics
Yeah
We at ground zero wit it
Bout to stiff-arm a few niggas (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Zero with it, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We just touched down (Yeah, yeah, yeah, nigga, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We just touched down
Touched down, we at ground zero with it
Ninety-nine yards, these weirdos finished
That's a touchdown (True)
Might have to stiff-arm a few niggas, go ahead
We ain't near these niggas
Mask on nigga fuck it, mask off we superhero wit it
We at ground zero wit it
Aww man, they don't care if you're sleeping
CeeLo wit it
Get a preload wit it
Sign a prenup
You don't need those niggas
It'll preload nigga
Wipe they nose, we don't need those niggas
We at ground zero wit it
We at ground zero wit it
Fuck it, mask on, mask off
Nigga, ground zero wit it
Ninety-nine yards is a touchdown
Arms reach
No one to trust now
Oh shit
I got my shit buss down, won't dance, buss down
But that's a must now
Hand to hands, can't trust now
We at ground zero
We got the mask buss down nigga
Fuck it nigga, mask on, mask off
We don't care if you sleep like CeeLo, nigga blast off like (pew, pew)
Nigga I got the mask buss down, got the gloves, got everything
We in here
I seen a few niggas with goggles on, I might cop those too
Shit, I got to look fly, you feel me?
I got my shoulders out, elbows poked bout to hold it down
Hold it now
Got the sanitizer
Hold it down
Sanitize a few niggas
Who's joking now?
Feel like Anquan Boldin now, way I'm running routes
And run around
Get the run around
Oh we at ground zero wit it
We at ground zero wit it
Might get my shit buss down
We at ground zero wit it
Oh, 'bout to get my shit buss down
Ground zero with it
Get my shit buss down
Oh, 'bout to get my shit buss down
Ground zero with it
Ground zero, ground zero
Oh, 'bout get my shit buss downEmbed
