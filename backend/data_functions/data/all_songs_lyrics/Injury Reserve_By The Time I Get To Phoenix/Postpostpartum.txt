Postpostpartum Lyrics
Don't you know?
I had my arms open
Soak it all in
Postpostpartum
Let's go hard
Yeah, we all in
Don't you know?
I had my arms open, yeah
Soak it all in
I was postpartum
But please, don't guard him
Pardon me for yawnin'
Nigga, we all in
I was just talkin' jargon
We was posted on the wall
While our seed was wylin'
Word, word
Nigga, we all in, please know

(Check it, yeah)
I was hurtin' from birthin' niggas
Shit, got into my mental, yeah
All these little lowercase t's
On instrumentals
Oh, please, just go be gentle, yeah
Drawing from my stencils, uh
Seein' all the itty-bitty knees, all about to tremble
But see, why am I salty, yeah?
Shit, I should be honored, yeah
But now they runnin' laps around mе
See, that's the problem you see
I'm just doin' my thing
But then thеy profiting like bees to a pollen
Now see, you see my problem
And you look around and they look just like, like you
(To you it's knee deep)
(To him, it's chin high)
(Fear is intertwined)
(But the cards that were dealt? Well, never mind)
(You gon need way more than some boots for all this)
You birthin' niggas
(Way more than a tool for all to fix so)
Nigga, you birthin' niggas
(So follow suit and them sins they gon follow you)
(You cast a way darker shade than your peers)
(And that's gon follow you)
(Further from the sun, so, from father to the son)
(Part of it is done, but it's hardly just begun)

I'd rather burn at the stake than boil in a pot
But you gotta pull em from the roots when you pull the plug, uncle  Lelo taught
It's been a blessing just to see you grow
But soon as you seen red
I should've seen red
Shit, you already know, tried every angle
Turned over every, turned every stone, shit, but one more to go
But please, it just turned to my season
All falls down to your feet
Nigga Geronimo
I had my arms to the sea but now they gotta close
And you look around and they look just like, like you
(Soak it all in, you gotta go)
(You birthin' niggas)
Soak it all in, you gotta go (Nigga, you birthin' niggas)
I ain't trying to be God or Dr. Frank
Oh nah, no no7Embed
