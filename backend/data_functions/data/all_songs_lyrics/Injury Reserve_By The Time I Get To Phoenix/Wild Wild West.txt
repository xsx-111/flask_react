Wild Wild West Lyrics
Can you hear me now?
Is this thing on?
5G
They puttin' towers up everywhere (Is this thing on?)
Can you hear me now?  (Wild, wild, willy)
5G, high speed
It's the wild, wild, west out here
Gotta stay on your Ps and Qs
(Don't call him Billy or he gon smack you silly)
High speed
It's the wild, wild west out here, yeah
It's ya boy, Willie Smiff
(I've got fifty thousand watts of power)
Got to stay on your Ps and Qs (yeah)

It's the wild, wild west out here
I'm Willie Smiff with the inspector gadget
I'm on that 5G, one click and let 'em–
One click can let 'em have it
High speed, soaring
I'm Norrin Radd with the intergalactic
Get baggagе, back start to spazzing
Have it
It's Willie Smiff (Willie, tеll 'em again)
It's the wild, wild, west
I'm Willie Smiff with the inspector gadget
Got the 5G
We puttin' towers up everywhere (5G, high speed)
The triple shot is hell of a hat trick
With the intergalactic (5G, high speed)
The triple, triple shot is hell of a hat trick
Before you see the end there ain't no freebies
It's Willie Smiff with the inspector gadget
It's Willie Smiff with the inspector gadget
Yeah, I'm Norrin Radd with the intergalactic
I'm on that 5G, one click can let 'em
High speed, triple shots, hell of a hat trick
My whip got the horses movin'
Or what are you doing? AI cyber truck will run em through em
The tonka same color as Willy Wonka's movement
Gobstopper, the crime stopper
5G will smoke your Cuban
Ah, you ruthless, imma opportunist
Oh, it's awkward too
When you step in an office that's a coffin too
In light speed, to infinity and beyond, we movin'
I'm beyond you humans
Is this thing on?Embed
