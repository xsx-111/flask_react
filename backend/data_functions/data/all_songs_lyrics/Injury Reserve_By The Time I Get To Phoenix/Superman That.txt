Superman That Lyrics
No, no
Don't talk
No, no

You
Ain't no savin' me, ain't no savin' me or you
You
Ain't no savin' me, ain't no savin' me or you
You
Ain't no savin' me, ain't no savin' me or you
You
Ain't no savin' me, ain't no savin' me or you
You

I can feel it in my bones
Man, they stripped what they own
Every stone that you've thrown
Every blow that you've shown
You can keep what you stitch until they peep now you reap what you sow
You can toot your horns hoot 'n holler but that’s just how that shit go
I can feel it in my bones
Man, they stripped what they own
Every stone that you've thrown
Every blow that you've shown
You can keep what you stitch until they peep now you reap what you sow
You can toot your horns hoot 'n holler but that’s just how that shit go
You
Ain't no savin' me, ain't no savin' me or you
You
Ain't no savin' me, ain't no savin' me or you
You

You
You
