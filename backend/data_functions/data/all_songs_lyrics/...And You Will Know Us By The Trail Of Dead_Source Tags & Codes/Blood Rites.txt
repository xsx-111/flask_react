Blood Rites LyricsYou wanna fight?
You wanna scream?
Knowing this is all a dream
Because all you see is blood
You're in fear
You're in denial
You better take care
Because all you see is blood rites
You look into the mirror
Then you step into the mirror
Then you falling through the mirror
All is blind
It's blinding your life
This fear is going after me
So bright I can barely see
Is this all just in my head
I look around and see that
Everything is turning red
You wanna fight?
You wanna scream?
Knowing this is all a dream
Because all you see is bloodEmbed
