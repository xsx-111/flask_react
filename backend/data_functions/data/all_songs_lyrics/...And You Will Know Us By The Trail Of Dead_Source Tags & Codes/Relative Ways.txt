Relative Ways Lyrics
It's hard to imagine, it's so hard to perceive
To find an expression for what it all means
All panic and struggle, all death and decay
Are coming together in relative ways

This electric guitar hanging to my knees
Got a couple of verses I can barely breathe
But it's all right, it's OK
It's coming together in relative ways

It's OK, I'm a saint
I forgave your mistakes
It's OK, I'm a saint
I forgave your mistakes

And It started to happen, and it'started to change
With the movement up on us, hope we make it OK
If it takes a life or a couple of days
Coming together in relative ways

An electric guitar hangs to my knees
Got a couple of verses I can barely breathe
It's all right, it's OK
It's coming together in relative ways
It's OK, I'm a saint
I forgave your mistakes
It's OK, I'm a saint
I forgave your mistakes
It's OK, I'm a saint
I forgave your mistakes
It's OK, I'm a saint
I forgave your mistakesEmbed
