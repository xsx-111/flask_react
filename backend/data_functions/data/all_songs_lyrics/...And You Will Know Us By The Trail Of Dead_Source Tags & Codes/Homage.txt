Homage LyricsIt is a round about
That I can't leave
I circle for decades
Only to find obscurity
My life is haunted
By young devilry
Young devilry
I heard your voice
On my radio
Lost into
These nights
Brutal kids
Of this promised future
Cut the highways
With shards of truth
I called out to my
Young and black hearted
Would I believe?
Do you believe in what I have seen?
Would I believe? Would I believe?
I heard your voice
On the radio
Lost into these nights
Nights
You're so nice
You're so nice
Do you believe
In what I have seen?
What I have seen?
What I have seen?
Do you believe
In what I have seen?
What I have seen?
Do you believe
In what I have seen?
What I have seen?
What I have seen?
What I have seen?
Do you believe
What I have seen?
What I have seen?Embed
