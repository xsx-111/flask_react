Heart in the Hand of the Matter LyricsRide the apocalypse
Coming through the city side
Fallen angel no need to hide
All bodies collide and fate decides
Where vengeance hits
Where our love will fit
I can't find your face
I can't see a trace
In a world coming to a close
I'm so damned, I can't win
With my heart in my hands again
Take your hurt, a muse of sin
With my heart in my hands again
And this is where it began
Shot through a shattered lens
And there is virtue in loneliness
In vacant lots and fluorescent malls
In one room coffins and crowded halls
There is nothing that can be done
We have lost all control
I walk in the shadows of your tortured realm
I'm so damned, I can't win
With heart in my hands again
Take your hurt, a muse of sin
Passing glance forgotten
Reason to doubt
So pry your eyes
From a film that never ends
I'm so damned, I can't win
With my heart in my hands again
I can't see a trace
I can't find a trace
I can't find your face
I can't see a trace
Ride the apocalypse
Coming through the city side
There is nowhere to hide
Ride the apocalypse
Fallen angel no need to hideEmbed
