Hour of Need LyricsIn the dark
While the obvious
Isn't clear
Can't believe
Just what can
Interfere
Remember what has been achieved
Keep trying it's the hour of need
What's the cost?
Can the end justify the means?
There's a need
So many mouths to feed
Remember what has been achieved
Keep trying it's the hour of need
Still hoping we can succeed
In this hour of need
Words unwritten
Mistrust suspicion
Stuck in this wilderness
For everyone
Water to drink
Either we sink or swimEmbed
