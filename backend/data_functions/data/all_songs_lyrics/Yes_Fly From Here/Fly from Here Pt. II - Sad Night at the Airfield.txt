Fly from Here Pt. II - Sad Night at the Airfield LyricsThere are no ground staff in the empty corridors
There's no one sleeping
No one awake
I'd start an engine in the night if only just to break the silence
That last intake
Of air
That clouds in the night as we breathe
Too late
For even the night planes to leave
We can wait for dawn
To carry on
Then we can fly from here
I want to be the one who always gives you shelter
Finds a way to
Keep you warm
I want to be the one
Who's always there beside you
But we both must
Face the dawn
Alone
So cruel like the world that we leave
Too late
For even the night planes to leave
We can wait for dawn
To carry on
Then we can fly from here
Only ghosts are in the empty corridors
And they're all strangers
Who never cared
I know them from some other life
When things were different
And we both were
In the air
Turn yourself around
Turn your life around
Turn your world around
Turn this ship around
So turn the wheel around
I watch the sky
All defenses down
I watch the sky
I watch the sky1Embed
