The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be LyricsWhat have I become?
What am I running away from?
I used to see
Things in a very different way
What am I to do?
I have changed my point of view
I was lost
Now I've found myself in you
From some other part of me
I'll summon the strength to see me through
From deep in the heart of me
To be everything you want me to
And that's when I start to be
The man you've always seen in me
The man you've always wanted me to be
What have we become?
What are we running away from?
We need to see
Life in a very different way
Learning what to do
After all that we've been through
No longer lost
We have found ourselves anew
From some other part of me
I'll summon the strength to see me through
From deep in the heart of me
To be everything you want me to
And that's when I start to be
The man you've always seen in me
The man you've always wanted me to be
Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah
The man you always wanted me
To be
The man you always wanted me
To be
Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah
Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah, Ee Yeah
Ee YeahEmbed
