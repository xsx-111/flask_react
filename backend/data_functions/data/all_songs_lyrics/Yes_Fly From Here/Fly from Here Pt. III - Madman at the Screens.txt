Fly from Here Pt. III - Madman at the Screens LyricsTake a table in the evening
By the water side
Lonely eyes watch as the moonshines
Down a silver tide
Looking out from this position
Are things what they seem?
It's been spreading out from one decision
Into this bad dream
Out on the shoreline
Someone is waiting
The wind that was falling
Is rising again
I hear the voices
I hear them calling
Every song was
Singing in the rain
Sailor
Sailor beware
There are storm clouds
You must take care
Easy
Bring her around
Or the night will
Run you aground
I know
In the ceiling over our heads
Fans and moving air
Spinning out the hours of darkness
Warning sounds somewhere
Out on the shoreline
Someone is waiting
The wind that was falling
Is rising again
I hear the voices
I hear them calling
Every song was
Singing in the rain
Sailor
Sailor beware
There are storm clouds
You must take care
Easy
Bring her around
Or the night will
Run you aground
Morning
Here in the air
When you feel it
Know that you're there
Playing God
Behind the scenes a
Madman at the screens
Dreaming
Feeling the air
Dreaming
Seeing you thereEmbed
