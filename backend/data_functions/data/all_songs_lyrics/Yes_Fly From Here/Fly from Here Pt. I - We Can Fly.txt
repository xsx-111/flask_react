Fly from Here Pt. I - We Can Fly LyricsAlong the edge of this airfield
The old prop-shaft airliners stand
Altimeters reading zero
Formless memories lingering
Nights are cold on this airfield
I sit alone and watch the radar
Locked on the wavelength, caught in the beam
Falling slowly into the screen
Every day that you waste
Is one more that you've lost
When you wake up
I see you there
On display
Lights the final point of no return
Taking us there from here
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
Into a sky that's clearing (we can fly)
Look back we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly
And love will never disappear
Along the edge of this airfield
The old prop-shaft airliners stand
Altimeters reading zero
Formless memories lingering
Lingering, lingering, lingering
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
Into a sky so clearly (we can fly)
Look back, we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here
On the understanding that we can fly
Everyday that you waste
Is one more that you've lost
On display
That's a final point of no return
Everyday that you waste
Is one more that you've lost
On display
That's a final point of no returnEmbed
