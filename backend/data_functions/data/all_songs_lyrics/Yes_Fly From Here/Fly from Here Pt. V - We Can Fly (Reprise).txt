Fly from Here Pt. V - We Can Fly (Reprise) LyricsWe can fly
We can fly
We can fly
We can fly
And we can fly from here
Into a sky that's clearing
Look back we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly
And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
On the understanding
That we can flyEmbed
