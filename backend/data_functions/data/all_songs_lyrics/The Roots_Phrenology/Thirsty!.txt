Thirsty! Lyrics Do it!

When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see

Ladies and gentlemen, you are now witnessing the dopest DJ on the planet...

When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see

When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to see
When I start, don't disturb me
Rhythm that get your mind thirsty
When I rock it's something to see
Something to see, something to seeEmbed
