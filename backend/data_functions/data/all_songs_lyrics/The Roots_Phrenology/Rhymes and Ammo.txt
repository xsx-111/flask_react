'Cause when I put rhymes in they minds, yo

Stop wishin, and sit your ass back

Ayo, when I say, "Pump that," y'all say, "Shit up"
Pump that! Shit up! Pump that! Shit up!
When I say, "Stand up," y'all say, "Get up"
Stand up! Get up! Stand up! Get up!
When I say, "Rise up," y'all say, "Now"
Rise up! Now! Rise up! Now!
When I say, "Lick a shot," say, "Blaow"
Lick a shot! Blaow! Lick a shot! Blaow!

Ayo, everybody on they jawns
Cartoons is hardcore porn
It ain't no afterschool paper routes, mowin lawns
Kids got backpacks full of yayo and heron
Coming to school shootin up the auditorium
Yo it's anthrax maniacs on the TV
The least of y'all worries should be Thought's CD
The chairman of the board coppin twice weekly
They done caught the minister with a pork BLT
If my shit ain't hot, it probly try to drive me
Psyhce, its somethin I can never let myself see
Can't see, I'm thorough-bread, nothin fancy
The maker, no matter what the circumstance be
Its the principle, pillowcase full of nickel
Smack like a mean kid do, leave him crippled
Keep talkin' greasey, I'mma big-lip you
Ayo, your man'll get slid with you
You and the squad takin to galoshes
You and the squad takin to galoshes
I hold the engineer for hostage
And spit from a dirty cartridge
Its L for whoever try to front on Thought's shit
I'm sendin them goons to your mom's apartment
Ayo, when I say, "Pump that," y'all say, "Shit up"
Pump that! Shit up! Pump that! Shit up!
When I say, "Stand up," y'all say, "Get up"
Stand up! Get up! Stand up! Get up!
When I say, "Rise up," y'all say, "Now"
Rise up! Now! Rise up! Now!
When I say, "Lick a shot," say, "Blaow"
Lick a shot! Blaow! Lick a shot! Blaow!


Ayo, when I say, "Pump that," y'all say, "Shit up"
Pump that! Shit up! Pump that! Shit up!
When I say, "Stand up," y'all say, "Get up"
Stand up! Get up! Stand up! Get up!
When I say, "Rise up," y'all say, "Now"
Rise up! Now! Rise up! Now!
When I say, "Lick a shot," say, "Blaow"
Lick a shot! Blaow! Lick a shot! Blaow!

Kweli, sittin' back in the cut like Res
In a constant peace, call me fantastic like I cut the grease
Baracudas movin and canoein sippin amaretto
I'm a ruler of my temple, what I do to instrumentals
Instrumentals is the development of these niggas mentals
Tears in your eyes like this moment is sentimental
Your fundamentally floored, philosophically bored
Disturbed like the eighth floor of your hospital ward
You've GOT to appoint niggas to raise the bar
Muslims praise Allah, Christians pray to God
Rastas, they say Jah
They find a way to rhyme with the pallet like fine wine
And make you say ahhh
Guess who's back?
The game needed improvement
Can't fit the bullshit no more, you sound stupid
I'm a shark in the water with constant movement
Influenced by music since a truant yo
This is how we do it yo
Ayo, when I say, "Pump that," y'all say, "Shit up"
Pump that! Shit up! Pump that! Shit up!
When I say, "Stand up," y'all say, "Get up"
Stand up! Get up! Stand up! Get up!
When I say, "Rise up," y'all say, "Now"
Rise up! Now! Rise up! Now!
When I say, "Lick a shot," say, "Blaow"
Lick a shot! Blaow! Lick a shot! Blaow!
Ayo, when I say, "Pump that," y'all say, "Shit up"
Pump that! Shit up! Pump that! Shit up!
When I say, "Stand up," y'all say, "Get up"
Stand up! Get up! Stand up! Get up!
When I say, "Rise up," y'all say, "Now"
Rise up! Now! Rise up! Now!
When I say, "Lick a shot," say, "Blaow"
Lick a shot! Blaow! Lick a shot! Blaow!Embed
