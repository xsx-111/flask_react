!!!!!!! Lyrics
Saw you at the crack house
Didn't want you to come back out
Stand behind me physical
Lady love you, love me too
Meanwhile you don't understand
How hard it is to be a man
Take goodbye and never look back again
We only scratched the surface of this shit
You make me look like a jerk
I can't afford to go to work
Meanwhile being man of the week
Here today, gone today
You're such a fucking hypocrite
You have no soul to steal this shit
"Sign the check I need new shoes"
Hey fuck you!Embed
