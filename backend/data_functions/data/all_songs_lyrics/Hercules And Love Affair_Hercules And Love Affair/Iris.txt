Iris Lyrics
She carries news travels by rainbow
Bearer of peace with a message for all
Today you'll dance
You'll share each other
Elders will stumble
The babies will crawl

Put down your weapons
Put down your chosen ones
Put on your best clothes
Stand straight and tall
Don't give up on your desire
I can understand your thirst
Put another one before you
Help someone else first

Today is a day for someone else
Today is a day for someone else
Today is a day for someone else
This moment is yours
And you can give it to someone else

She carries news travels by rainbow
Bearer of peace with a message for all
Today you'll dance
You'll share each other
Elders will stumble
The babies will crawl
Put down your weapons
Put down your chosen ones
Put on your best clothes
Stand straight and tall
Don't give up on your desire
I can understand your thirst
Put another one before you
Help someone else first

Today is a day for someone else
Today is a day for someone else
Today is a day for someone else
This moment is yours
And you can give it to someone else
This moment is yours
And you can give it to someone else

(Put down your weapons)
(Put down your chosen ones)
This moment is yours
And you can give it to someone else
(Leave expectations at the door)
(You are your brother)
(You are your sister)
This moment is yours
And you can give it to someone else
(Communication, start giving more)
(Don't stop believing)
(Continue to give praise)
This moment is yours
And you can give it to someone else
(Your exaltation is a good thing)
(Just take those teachings)
(The ones of light)
This moment is yours
And you can give it to someone else
(Of celebration, and start to sing)Embed
