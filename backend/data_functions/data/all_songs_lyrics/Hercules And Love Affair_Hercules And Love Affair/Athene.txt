Athene Lyrics
Athena, she's the woman of war
She gives us the reasons
Reasons worth fighting for
Athena, she offers protection
She taught me how to make
Make my life's reflection

How I yearn for her wisdom
I look in every face
The grey eyes, the gentle kiss
I look for the safe place

Athena, not perfect but so strong
Warring with her own heart
Singing a woman's song
Athena, with her hands she could give
Through the battles of her life
She showed me how to live

How I yearn for her wisdom
I look in every face
The grey eyes, the gentle kiss
I look for the safe place

How I yearn for her wisdom
I look in every face
The grey eyes, the gentle kiss
I look for the safe place
How I yearn for her wisdom
I look in every face
The grey eyes, the gentle kiss
I look for the safe placeEmbed
