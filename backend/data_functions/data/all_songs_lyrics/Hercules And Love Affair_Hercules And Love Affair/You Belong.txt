You Belong Lyrics
The lights they call me
Call me to your side
The lights they bind me
They take my sight
Will you restore me?
Grace my senses again?
The lights they blind me
Soon he descends

You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do

With words unspoken
The truth is revealed
Gates fly open
You chance to be healed
How he adores you
Will I be with you my friend?
The lights they blind me
Soon he descends
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do
You belong to him tonight
There is nothing I can do

You belong to him tonight
You belong
Yes you belong
You belong
Yes you belong
You belong
Yes you belong
You belong
Yes you belong
You belong
Yes you belong
You belong
Yes you belong
You belong
Yes you belong
You belong
Yes you belong
You belong him tonightEmbed
