Raise Me Up Lyrics
My secret love
Keeps me awake at night
My secret love of the man
My secret fight
They took you down
They pushed your face down
They fucked you over and around
You kissed the ground

Oh, raise me up
I forgot to dance your name
Oh, raise me up
I will never dance again

Before I dance again
Before I dance again
Before I dance again
Before I dance again
(Before, before, before, before)

You're the one
I waited for your return
I slept with rocks, I slept with stones
Stone was my home
Energy
Life danced right out of me (love)
When my father busted you free (love)
He also killed me
Oh, raise me up
To dance upon your head (head, head)
Oh, raise me up
To dance in the holes of your head


Oh, raise me up
Oh, raise me up
(To dance in the cavities of your eyes)
Oh, raise me up
Oh, raise me up
(To dance in the cavities of your eyes)
Oh, raise me up
Oh, raise me up
Oh, raise me up
Oh, raise me up
To dance in the cavities of Your eyesEmbed
