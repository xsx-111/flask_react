Blind Lyrics
As a child I knew
That the stars could only get brighter
Then we would get closer
Get closer
As a child I knew
That the stars could only get brighter
That we could get closer
Leaving th√≠s darkness
Behind

Now that I'm older
The stars shed light upon my face
But when I find myself alone
Find myself alone
Now that I'm older
The stars shed light upon my face
But when I find myself alone
I feel like I, I am blind

I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
Like I am blind
I wish the stars could shine now
For they are closer, they are near
But they will not present my present
They will not present my present
I wish the light could shine now
For it is closer, it is near
But it will not present my present
And it makes my past and future painfully clear

To hear you now
To see you now
I can look outside myself
I must examine my breath and look inside
To see you now
To hear you now
I can look outside myself
I must examine my breath and look inside
Because I feel blind, because I feel blind

I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
I feel it
Like I am blind
I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it
Ooh, I feel it3Embed
