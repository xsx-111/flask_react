Easy Lyrics
We all share the light
It is so freely ours
I pray my friends
Sun come down easy
Sun come down easy

I am not a fisherman
But I do know the sea
I say my friend
Waves come down easy
Waves come down easy
Waves come down easy
Waves come down easy

The clouds that hang above
They nourish, they feed
I pray my friends
Rain comes down easy
Rain comes down easy

There is a rhythm
She plays her drums her songs
I pray my friends
We must go easy
We must go easy
We must go easy
We must go easy
Walk, walk slowly, don't run
There is no where to get to
Walk, walk slowly don't run
Stay with your family
Walk, walk slowly, don't run
There is no where to get to
Walk, walk slowly don't run
Stay with your family
Walk, walk slowly, don't run
There is no where to get to
Walk, walk slowly don't run
Stay with your family
Walk, walk slowly, don't run
There is no where to get to
Walk, walk slowly don't run
Stay with your family

This day she gives us
It is a gift
Honor your family
This day she gives us
It is a gift
Honor your familyEmbed
