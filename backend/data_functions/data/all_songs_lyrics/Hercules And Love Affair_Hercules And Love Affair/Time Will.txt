Time Will Lyrics
Don't lie to me
Don't make it up
Don't snake it up
Don't snake it up, my friend
Lay with me
Stand by me
Be true to me
Be true to me, my love

Now I'm young
I got nothing to lose
I'm gonna follow
I'm following my muse
You're the older one
You're older by now
You're one got some
You're one got some to prove

Well it's only me
It's only me now
I cannot change you but time will
My heart it will not stand still
Well it's only me
It's only me now
I cannot change you but time will
My heart it will not stand still
I cannot hold a half a life
I cannot be at half a wife
I cannot hold a half a life
I cannot be at half a wife
I cannot hold a half a life
I cannot be at half a wife
I cannot hold a half a life
I cannot be at half a wife
I cannot hold a half a life
I cannot be at half a wife
I cannot hold a half a life
I cannot be at half a wife
I cannot hold a half a life
I cannot be at half a wife
I cannot hold a half a life
I cannot be at half a wifeEmbed
