This Is My Love Lyrics
I met the smiling face of love
She's in my mind always
Through the hero she put into my life
She kisses all my days
I used to see a twisted face
The only one I knew
I kissed the burning lips of lust
It's all I knew to do

This is my love
This is my love
This is my love
This is my love

How I wished for her
Good fortune
I tried so hard to see
I listened to the night time breeze
But she is quiet as can be
In all the searching we do
To find love's gentle being
If we open more than just our eyes
We might know what we're seeing
This is my love
This is my love
This is my love
This is my love

I met the smiling face of love
She's in my mind always
Through the hero she put into my life
She kisses all my days
I used to see a twisted face
The only one I knew
I kissed the burning lips of lust
It's all I knew to do

This is my love
This is my love
This is my love
This is my love1Embed
