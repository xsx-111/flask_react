Smoochie Lyrics
When my personal demons are screaming
And when my door of madness is half-open

You stand alongside
And say something to the effect that everything'll be
Alright soon, smoochie

Chaos attends to creation
And when the shadows inside me vie for attention

You stand alongside
And say something perfect like "concealment feeds the fear"
And hand me a sea peach
And say, "Come, come over here, smoochie"3Embed
