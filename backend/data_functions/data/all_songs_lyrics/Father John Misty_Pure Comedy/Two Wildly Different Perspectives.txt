Two Wildly Different Perspectives Lyrics
One side says "Y'all go to hell."
The other says "If I believed in God, I'd send you there."
But either way we make some space
In the hell that we create
On both sides

One side says "Kill 'em all."
The other says "Line those killers up against the wall."
But either way some blood is shed
Thanks to our cooperation
On both sides, on both sides

One side says "Man, take what's yours!"
The other says "Live on no more than you can afford."
But either way we just possess
And everyone ends up with less
On both sides, on both sides1Embed
