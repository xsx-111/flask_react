Birdie Lyrics
Take off, little winged creature
It's nothing but teens in ravines
And antics on concrete down here
And are you really as free as all the great songs would have me believe?
Let me tell you why some day, birdie, you're gonna envy me
Some dream of a world written in lines of code
Well, I hope they engineer out politics, romance, and edifice
Two outta three ain't bad
Some envision a state governed by laws of business
Merger and acquisition instead of violence on nations
Where do I sign up?

Take off, little winged creature
It's nothing but fallen debris, strollers, and babies down here
And you may be up in the sky
But our paradigms are just as deep and just as wide
What with all our best attempts at transcendence
Something's bound to take
Soon, we'll live in a global culture devoid of gender or race
There's just one tiny line:
You're either born behind or you're free to peek inside
Life as just narrative, metadata in aggregate
Where the enigma of humanity's wrapped up finally
That, as they say, is that
Oh, that day can't come soon enough
It'll be so glorious
When they finally find out what's bugging us1Embed
