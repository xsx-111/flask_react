Total Entertainment Forever Lyrics
Bedding Taylor Swift every night inside the Oculus Rift
After mister and the missus finish dinner and the dishes

And now the future's definition is so much higher than it was last year
It's like the images have all become real
And someone's living my life for me out in the mirror

No, can you believe how far we've come?
In the new age
Freedom to have what you want
In the new age we'll all be entertained
Rich or poor, the channels are all the same
You're a star now, baby, so dry your tears
You're just like them
Wake on up from the nightmare

Na, na na, na, na na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na, na na, na na, na na
Come on, oh, oh, oh

No gods to rule us
No drugs to soothe us
No myths to prove stuff
No love to confuse us
Not bad for a race of demented monkeys
From a cave to a city to a permanent party
Come on, oh, oh, oh
When the historians find us we'll be in our homes
Plugged into our hubs
Skin and bones
A frozen smile on every face
As the stories replay
This must have been a wonderful place5Embed
