Sleeping Giant Lyrics
Earth has burst
Mountain flames
Moon beheld
Father snake
Mind control
Has left its nest

Shame on

Bulls roar loud
The fearless fall
Wooden vessel
Broken wings
Caught my killer
In my grave



Eyes of grace
Kill again
Trapped in maze
Trembling fear
Head-scorched brow
Perish the land

Burn! Burn!
Burn! Burn!

A vast, calm wilderness
The call to adventure comes


Lead and land atop this rock
Infinite path carved with unrivaled skill1Embed
