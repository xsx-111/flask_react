Circle of Cysquatch Lyrics
Elephant spirits
Tower of ivory
Story of ancient deities

Seizer
Of the fleece
Protector
Of this place

Fly through dreamscapes
Of valleys, gullies, and spires
Herd across suicidal slopes

Changeless
Moon shines
Circle
Cyclops image

A race of one-eyed beings
All feared and shunned
Rakshasa demon
Seizer
Of the fleece
Protector
Of this place
Eyes all around you
Enter the labyrinth
Visions of the hunted
Beware the Birchmen

Incisors
Thought to be
Skulls of us
Our release2Embed
