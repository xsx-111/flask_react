Hunters of the Sky Lyrics
Running faster than I ever have
Evading sharks of the sky
Death trap and I kill again
Dig through my own hives
Shelter from sky
Talon of raptor

Force-fed glass giant moth
Reaping fields of the flesh
Heavy hand thwart the scheme
Of the dominant nymph
Omen she brings
Carried on weathered wings

Fly, reptile
Leather wings
Bones hollow
Petrified

Fly, reptile
Leather wings
Bones hollow
Petrified
Running faster than I ever have
Evading sharks of the sky

The earth's ashing floats
What's good for man
Cast us out
Into the knownEmbed
