The Wolf Is Loose Lyrics
The hero of the gods
The crossing of the threshold
The belly of the whale
Refusal of return

Hollow eyes
Dry, pale legs
Howling on
Through fields and graves

Language of the sign
Symbols to our sight
Guardian to thy throne
Take on form

Daylight
Hide the skin
Cut it off
Scatter ash in the wind

Shapeshifters rolling on winds of tyrants make
Fierce lore of fanged horn, danger all the way
Night's sea reflection, the faces of bodies slain
Return to form of natural human's fate
Grown from the cold
Spirits unclean
Dealer of the days
The ice thaw

As the soldier walks through the crimson side
Researchers of aftermath
Dispelling disarming man
One-toed horses subject of Genesis
And the immigrants
Fundamental side of a human mind
Hulder folk and fairies
So believe

The hero of the gods
The crossing of the threshold
The belly of the whale
Refusal of returnEmbed
