Crystal Skull (Live) LyricsGuide a truth
Prevail and ride
Into the black hole
Searching for crystal
Making the veins bleed
The source of consciousness alive
Crystalline resonance
Into the black hole
Searching for crystal
Making the veins bleed
One million voices
Disarming
One thousand faces
Disarming
Running through the darkness
Holding hearts in my eyes
Falling short of gauntlet
Covered in blood-sucking flies
The touch is cold
I tore a path screaming
Through wind and blood
I will it all, burning deep in my skullEmbed
