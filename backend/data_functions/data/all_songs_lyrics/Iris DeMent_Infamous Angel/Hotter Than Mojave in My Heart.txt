Hotter Than Mojave in My Heart Lyrics
Well, I've heard 'em say there's one for everybody
And I just knew somehow that you'd be the one for me
Because making love with you's not just a hobby
No, it's the flame that burnt the forest down in me

And darling, was it day or was it nighttime?
Were them whippoorwills a-moaning through the trees?
Through the trees?
I don't remember just what you said
But ooh, right from the start
You made me hotter than Mojave in my heart

Well baby, I could stay this way forever
Just passing time at ninety-nine degrees
Because loving you's my favorite kind of weather
Oh, forever let the flame burn down in me

And I'll not prepare my heart for the change of season
And I'll whip old Winter Wind there if she blows, if she blows
Well, God bless the day that you came along
And you tipped my apple cart
And you made me hotter than Mojave in my heart
And I'll not prepare my heart for the change of season
And I'm gonna whip old Winter Wind there if she blows, if she blows
God bless the day that you came along
And you tipped my apple cart
And you made me hotter than Mojave in my heart

Now it's hotter than Mojave in my heartEmbed
