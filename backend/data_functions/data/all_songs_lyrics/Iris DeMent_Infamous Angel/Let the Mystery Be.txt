Let the Mystery Be Lyrics
Everybody is wondering what and where
They all came from
Everybody is worrying about where they're going to go
When the whole thing's done
But no one knows for certain and so it's all the same to me
I think I'll just let the mystery be

Some say once gone you're gone forever
And some say you're going to come back
Some say you rest in the arms of the Saviour
If in sinful ways you lack
Some say that they're coming back in a garden
Bunch of carrots and little sweet peas
I think I'll just let the mystery be

Everybody is wondering what and where
They all came from
Everybody is worrying about where they're going to go
When the whole thing's done
But no one knows for certain and so it's all the same to me
I think I'll just let the mystery be

Some say they're going to a place called Glory
And I ain't saying it ain't a fact
But I've heard that I'm on the road to Purgatory
And I don't like the sound of that
I believe in love and I live my life accordingly
But I choose to let the mystery be
Everybody is wondering what and where
They all came from
Everybody is worrying about where they're going to go
When the whole thing's done
But no one knows for certain and so it's all the same to me
I think I'll just let the mystery be
I think I'll just let the mystery be1Embed
