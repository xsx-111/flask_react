Sweet Forgiveness Lyrics
Sweet forgiveness, that's what you give to me
When you hold me close
And you say: "That's all over."
You don't go looking back
You don't hold the cards to stack
Because you mean what you say

Sweet forgiveness, you help me see
I'm not near as bad
As I sometimes appear to be
When you hold me close
And you say: "That's all over
"And I still love you."

There's no way that I could make up
For those angry words I said
Sometimes it gets to hurting
And the pain goes to my head

Sweet forgiveness, dear God above
I say we all deserve
A taste of this kind of love
Someone who'll hold our hand
And whisper: "I understand
"And I still love you."Embed
