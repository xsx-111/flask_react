When Love Was Young Lyrics
Look at you, look at me
My heart breaks, as I read our sad story

Never thought that I'd be
Here with you wishing I was free
I never dreamed today would come
When love was young

There was nothing I would not do
For the chance to see your face
How could I have known back then
That today I'd hesitate
When you hold me in your arms
I don't yearn for that charm
I never dreamed today would come
When love was young

Look at how our curtain fell
Guess it's true only time can tell
About an ending
Kids are grown, we've had our day
Guess it's time now to go away
I never dreamed today would come
When love was young

I never dreamed today would come
When love was young, ooh, oohEmbed
