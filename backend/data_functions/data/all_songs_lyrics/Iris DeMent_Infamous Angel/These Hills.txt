These Hills Lyrics
Far away I've travelled
To stand once more alone
And hear my memories echo
Through these hills that I call home
As a child I roamed this valley
I watched the seasons come and go
I spent many hours dreaming
On these hills that I call home

The wind is rushing through the valley
And I don't feel so all alone
When I see the dandelions blowing
Across the hills that I call home

Like the flowers, I am fading
Into my setting sun
Brother and Sister passed before me
Mama and Daddy, they've long since gone

The wind is rushing through the valley
And I don't feel so all alone
When I see the dandelions blowing
Across the hills that I call home
These are the hills that I call homeEmbed
