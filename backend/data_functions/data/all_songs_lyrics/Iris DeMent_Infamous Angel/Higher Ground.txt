Higher Ground Lyrics
No voice has inspired me more than my mother's
She showed me that music is a pathway to higher ground

I'm pressing on the upward way
New heights I'm gaining every day
Still praying as I'm onward bound
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground

Lord, lift me up and let me stand
By faith on Heaven's table land
A higher plain than I have found
Lord, plant me feet on higher ground

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay
Though some may dwell where these abound
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground


I want to scale the utmost heights
And catch a gleam of glory bright
But still, I'll pray until Heaven I've found
Lord, lead me on to higher ground
