Dance to Another Tune Lyrics
Will you look at me?
Take a good look at me
And tell me who it is that I am
This old mirror it is broken
There's too much drift in the dam

It's not the world that's spinning that's me
I go from nowhere to nowhere searching for the key
But there's nothing new under the sun
All that will happen has already begun

Will you savour this in your mind?
This old feeling when you're left behind
Will you hold to this as true?
Or will you dance to another tune?

I was watching for a long time
As people crossed the street
Some heavy sadness weighed upon me
As I sat silent in the car seat

Shadows with that same look upon their faces
A child will die that nobody embraces
Everything gets tiresome, everything grows old
With each secret revealed, there's another to be told
Will you savour this in your mind?
This old feeling when you're left behind
Will you hold to this as true?
Or will you dance to another tune?

Will you look at me?
Take a good look at me
And tell me who it is that I am1Embed
