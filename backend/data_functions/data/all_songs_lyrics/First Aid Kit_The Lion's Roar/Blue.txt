Blue Lyrics
In the morning on the train
You sit and stare out at the rain
Or bury yourself in your books
Don't look at no strangers
No, don't give them any looks
But you ask yourself why you're so afraid
Why you hesitate when someone asks your name
Like they'll come too close if you tell them the truth
Who's to say they want something from you

But you're just a shell of your former you
That stranger in the mirror
Oh, that's you
Why do you look so blue?

And the only man you ever loved
Who you thought was gonna marry you
Died in a car accident when he was only 22
Then you just decided love wasn't for you
And every year since then
Has proved it to be true

Now you're just a shell of your former you
That stranger in the mirror
Oh, that's you
Why do you look so blue?
Maybe tomorrow you will make a change
Maybe someday soon you will find the strength

But you're just a shell of your former you
That stranger in the mirror
Oh, that's you
Why do you look so blue?1Embed
