King of The World Lyrics
At ten in the morning
I was laughing at something at the airport terminal
At nine in the evening
I was sitting crying to you over the phone
While passing the border from a state to another
Filled with people whom I couldn't help to relate to
And we stopped awhile at a roadside restaurant
Where the waitress was sitting outside smoking in her car
She had that look of total fear in her eyes
And as we drove away from there she looked at me and she smiled

I keep running around
Trying to find the ground
But my head is in the stars
And my feet are in the sky
Oh I'm nobody's baby
I'm everybody's girl
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world

And once you asked me well what's my biggest fear
That things would always remain so unclear
That one day I'd wake up all alone
With a big family and emptiness deep in my bones
That I would be so blinded, turn a deaf ear
And that my fake laugh would suddenly sound sincere
Now I wasn't born for anything
Wasn't born to say anything
I'm just here now and soon I'll be gone
[Oh I'm nobody's baby
I'm everybody's girl]
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world

Now everyday there's a short intermission
While I sleep they start dimming the lights
But I've seen everything I ever want to see
Screaming "Fire!" in a theater, people taking their seats
Watch it all go down like a stone in a stream
If you fall for your reflection you will drown in a dream

Tell me something real
Tell me something true
I just want to feel there's something left that I can do
But I'm nobody's baby
I'm everybody's girl
I'm the queen of nothing
I'm the king of the world1Embed
