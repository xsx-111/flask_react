In The Hearts of Men Lyrics
In the hearts of men
In the arms of mothers
And the parts we play
To convince others

We know what we're doing
And we're doing it right
You may have written books on the subject
But then you may still be surprised
By your tone over the phone
To your sister while waiting in line
At the shopping mall just outside of town

In the hands of teachers
In the books you read
And the things we say
When we've lost the lead
I still try to speak up
When my voice won't make a sound
And I've thought it over, too many times
But when there is no use, and the lights are all out
I just give it up and I walk home
Past the shopping mall that's just closing down
But what you tell yourself you are must be what you'll be
Who's to say who is who and what is what if you simply don't agree
Now time will come to claim you and it will have its way
Don't make no mistakes and don't regret, don't waste the time that is left
And then, do it all, with a goddamn smile

In the hearts of men
In the arms of mothers
And the parts we play
To convince othersEmbed
