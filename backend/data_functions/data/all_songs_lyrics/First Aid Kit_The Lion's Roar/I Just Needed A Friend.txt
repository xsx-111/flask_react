I Just Needed A Friend Lyrics
So I could just sit here listening to the breeze
Say we're all gonna die that curable disease
So I'm ready to be taken wherever it takes me to
But I'd rather just sit here waiting for you

So look, see here, this is all that I am
Some amateur painting in a golden frame
Forgive me, forgive me is all I have left
I guess I just needed a friend

Words that once sounded sweet to my ears
Hold me close, I am full of these fears
Here where I stutter and shake
Only a mistake

Now we can play dress up, yes, I'll play the part
I'll stand up and laugh at my own frightened heart
Haha, haha, ain't it absurd how things can turn?
It's these kinds of nights I forget the lessons I've learned

So look, see here, this is all that you are
I tried to find out how broke down these walls
I'm sorry, I'm sorry it had to be that way
I guess I just needed a friend
Words that once sounded sweet to my ears
Hold me closer, I am full of these fears
Here where I stutter and shake
Only a mistake

Words that once sounded sweet to my ears
Hold me close, I am full of these fears
Here where I stutter and shake
Only a mistakeEmbed
