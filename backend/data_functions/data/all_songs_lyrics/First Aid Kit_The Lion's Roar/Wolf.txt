Wolf Lyrics
Wolf mother, where you been?
You look so worn, so thin
You're a taker, devil's maker
Let me hear you sing, hey ya hey ya
Wolf father, at the door
You don't smile anymore
You're a drifter, shapeshifter
Let me see you run, hey ya hey ya

Holy light
Oh burn the night, oh keep the spirits strong
Watch it grow, child of woe
Keep holding on

When I run through the deep dark forest long after this begun
Where the sun would set, trees were dead and the rivers were none
And I hope for a trace to lead me back home from this place
But there was no sound, there was only me and my disgrace
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, ya
Wolf mother, where you been?
You look so worn, so thin
You're a taker, devil's maker
Let me hear you say, hey ya hey ya
Wolf father, at the door
You don't smile anymore
You're a drifter, shapeshifter
Let me see you run, hey ya hey ya

Wayward winds
The voice that sings of a forgotten land
See it fall, child of woe
Lend a mending hand

When I run through the deep dark forest long after this begun
Where the sun would set, trees were dead and the rivers were none
And I hope for a trace to lead me back home from this place
But there was no sound, there was only me and my disgrace
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey-hey, hey, ya2Embed
