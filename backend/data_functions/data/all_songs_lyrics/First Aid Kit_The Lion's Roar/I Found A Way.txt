I Found A Way Lyrics
It's me, it's me, you've come to take
My duality awakes
By midnight time I could not see
If I were you or you were me
We played the game with skillful hands
And so I asked for your demands
"Give me your love, give me your gun"
And he traced us back to where we'd begun

And so the morning came
And swept the night away
As I was looking for a way to disappear
Amongst the quiet things
And all these empty streets
I found a way, I found a way to reappear

I'll follow you where you go
Yes, I'll be there, just so you know
I need your condolence and your trust
But I won't ask, won't ask for much

There's a heavy load upon our backs
Of things we carry from the past
My guilt-filled mind, it tried to run
But you traced us back to where we'd begun
So the morning came
And swept the night away
As I was looking for a way to disappear
Amongst the quiet things
And all these empty streets
I found a way, I found a way to reappear

I'll follow you where you go
Yes, I'll be there, just so you know
I need your condolence and your trust
But I won't ask, won't ask for much
I'll only ask for so much
No, I won't ask, won't ask for much

And so the morning came
Swept the night away
I found a way, I found a way
To reappear3Embed
