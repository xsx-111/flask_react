Some Distant Memory Lyrics
There's some kind of freedom
I am searching for
Sometimes I think it'll turn up
If I just run out the door
But when I think of it
I don't know what it could be
If you find out, would you be so kind?
Please tell me

Oh I've never seen the night sky burn so bright
The mere vision could turn you blind
And I never knew it could happen like this
But you never know till you see
The day through

Life's what you make it
But it depends on where you start
And this woman in front of me
Says she'll meet my fate in her car
So where are we all headed?
And what was my plan?
She has no idea but speaks of
Some tall dark handsome man
Oh I've never seen the night sky burn so bright
The mere vision could turn you blind
And I never knew it could happen like this
But you never know till you see
The day through

Now everything I touch
Turns into some distant memory
You'll pass me by, but nobody seems to see
I have no idea what I'm running towardsEmbed
