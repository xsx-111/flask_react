This Old Routine Lyrics
So you come on home, walk through the door
She's in the kitchen searching through the drawers
So you stop and watch her and ask what she's looking for
She says she's not sure
And it gets late and you turned off the lights
Her body's so close to you in the night
But you dare not touch her and you don't wanna fight
So you just say, "Goodnight."

This old routine will drive you mad
It's just a mumble never spoken out loud
And sometimes you don't even know why you loved her
Well you look at her now and you see why

And your youngest is out fighting a war
But he won't say what he's fighting for
If he's gone because of or for you
Or which you'd rather be true

This old routine will drive you mad
It's just a mumble never spoken out loud
And sometimes you can't even recall the sound of his laughter
Oh, well did you ever really know the sound?
This old routine will drive you mad
It's just a mumble never spoken out loud
And sometimes you don't even know how you're still standing
Well she looks at you now and you see how
Well you look at them now and you know how1Embed
