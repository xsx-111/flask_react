Emmylou Lyrics
Oh the bitter winds are coming in
And I'm already missing the summer
Stockholm's cold, but I've been told
I was born to endure this kind of weather
When it's you I find, like a ghost in my mind
I am defeated and I gladly wear the crown

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me

Now so much I know that things just don't grow
If you don't bless them with your patience
And I've been there before, I held up the door
For every stranger with a promise
But, I'm holding back, that's the strength that I lack
Every morning keeps returning up my window
And it brings me to you, and I won't just pass through
But I'm not asking for a storm

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me
And yes, I might have lied to you
But you wouldn't benefit from knowing the truth
I was frightened but I held fast
I need you now at long last

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me

I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June
If you'll be my Gram and my Johnny too
No, I'm not asking much of you
Just sing, little darling, sing with me
Just sing, little darling, sing with me7Embed
