To A Poet Lyrics
And you said, "Don't give me nothing you don't want to lose"
I said "Darling, I'll give you everything I got if I want, I'm to choose"
Then I got on a plane and flew far away from you
Though unwillingly I left and it was so, so hard to do

The streets here at home had rapidly filled up
With the whitest of snow
And they don't make no excuse for themselves
And there's no need, I know

Now I miss you more than I can take and I will surely break
And every morning that I wake, oh, there's this ache
But there's nothing more to it, I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it, I just get through it

It always takes me by surprise how dark it gets this time of year
And how apparent it all becomes that you're not close, not even near
No matter how many times I tell myself I have to be sincere
I have a hard time standing up and facing those fears

But Frank put it best when he said, "You can't plan on the heart"
Those words keep me on my feet when I think I might just fall apart
Now I miss you more than I can take and I will surely break
And every morning that I wake, oh, there's this ache
But there's nothing more to it, I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it, I just get through it
Oh, there's nothing more to it, I just get through it

And so I ask where are you now, just when I needed you
I won't ask again, because I know there's nothing we can do
Not now, darling, you know it's true4Embed
