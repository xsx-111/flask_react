Upton Heath LyricsMany times I’ve walked alone here
Carried with the breeze
And many more have walked beside me
Carried with the breeze
All that we are
And all we shall be
Walk with me
Up on Upton Heath
So many times I’ve walked alone here
Carried with the breeze
And many more have walked beside me
Carried with the breeze
And all that we are
And all we shall be
Walk with me
Up on Upton Heath
Early distant warning finds us lost along the way
The echoes of a perfect summer
Lost along the way
Through the years
So many times I’ve walked alone here
Carried with the breeze
Many more have walked beside me
Carried with the breeze
All that we are
All we shall be
Walk with me
Up on Upton Heath
So many times I’ve walked alone
So many times along the road
Many times I’ve walked alone here
Many times I’ve walked alone here
Carried with the breezeEmbed
