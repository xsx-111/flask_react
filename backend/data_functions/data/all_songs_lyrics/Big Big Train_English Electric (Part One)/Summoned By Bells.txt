Summoned By Bells LyricsTook a little time
To find the past
To walk the roads
We used to know
That lead us home
Houses in terraced rows
That crowd around
The railway yard
Just sidings now
All overgrown
Above the high fields
Clouds are grey and gold;
It’s as good a place as anywhere
War came
And fires were seen
From 30 miles away;
A city burned
They wait in line
Out in the high fields
Summoned by bells
Church; school; factory; home
Along the London Road
Across the park at Spinney Hill
Sledging in the snow
We had our scrapes and our fights
It was part of the deal
Time moved quickly then
Things were changing all around
The world came
To this small world
Over the hillsides and rooftops
Different stories were heard
We moved on
Found a new place
We remembered the days
Of our younger lives
We moved on
Long years pass
We walk the roads
We used to know
Carried with the
Rain that falls
A stone’s throw from the line
Some of the old places survive
A golden thread in time
A stream running down from the hills
Into the heart of the high fields
So come on now
You know it’s alright
Those were the days of our younger lives
Early evening, midweek
In a market town
Walking down those
Same old roads
We knowEmbed
