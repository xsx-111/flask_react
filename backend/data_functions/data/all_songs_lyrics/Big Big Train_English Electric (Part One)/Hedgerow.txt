Hedgerow LyricsTell me do you know
The song of the hedgerow?
Coal for the winter
Ashes and cinders
Hey
Come on and see what I’ve found
Too many hours spent under the ground
Hey
Come on and see what I know
Get out in the fields
And out of the town o
Hedgerow do you know
Which way the wind blows?
Stoking the fire
Bramble and briar
(Springtime)
Come on and see what I’ve found
(Summer)
Too many hours spent under the ground
(Autumn)
Come on and see what I know
(Winter)
Get out in the fields
And out of the town
That is where you will find me
Out there
Waiting o
Hedgerow
