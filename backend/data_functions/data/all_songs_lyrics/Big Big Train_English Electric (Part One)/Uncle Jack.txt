Uncle Jack LyricsUncle Jack knows
A song of the hedgerows
The tilt of the earth
Makes the sun high
In the bright summer sky
Intensity of light
The earth turns around the sun
Spinning around the sun
Uncle Jack knows
A song of the hedgerows
Yes he does
Uncle Jackdaw
You see he’s heard it all before
Ancient and reborn
The flowers and the leaves
The birds and the seeds
The flowers draw the bees
And just after three
Evergreen and a mug of tea
Dog and master sound asleep
Uncle Jack knows
A song of the hedgerows
Don’t you know
The hawthorn, blackthorn, hazel
Hedgerow Oh Oh
Rose Hips
Haw Berries
