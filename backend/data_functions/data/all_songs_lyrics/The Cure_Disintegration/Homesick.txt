Homesick Lyrics

Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win turns to nothing today

And I forget how to move when my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts in a blood-stained sky
Oh it was sweet, it was wild
And, oh, how we
I trembled, stuck in honey, honey
Cling to me

So just one more, just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home

Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win turns to nothing today

So just one more, just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me to never go home
To never go home
