Xavier LyricsFair Roseanna
Your vagrancy's a familiar tale
Fraught with danger
The lives you led were judged profane
Hatred enfolds us
Inculcates the minds with its heresy
Laymen enfold us
Clemency arrive to set you free
Faith, although Xavier has prayed
That life-giving waters may rain
Down on the souls of men
To cure them of their ways
These were the sins of Xavier's past
Hung like jewels in the forest of veils
Deep in the heart where the mysteries emerge
Eve bears the stigma of original sin
Freedom's so hard
When we are all bound by laws
Etched in the scheme of nature's own hand
Unseen by all those who fail
In their pursuit of fate
Faith, although Xavier has prayed
That life-giving waters may rain
Down on the souls of man
To cure them of their ways
And as the night turns into day
Will the sun illuminate your way
Or will your nightmares come home to stay?
Xavier's love lies in chains
These were the sins of Xavier's past
Hung like jewels in the forest of veils1Embed
