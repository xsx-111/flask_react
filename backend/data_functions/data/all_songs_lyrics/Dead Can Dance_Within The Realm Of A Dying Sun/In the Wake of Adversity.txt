In the Wake of Adversity LyricsHey, Patrice, don't cry
They've no reason to harm you at all
They don't realise
That the angels surround you with light
They don't understand
Their narrow ways defeat them where they stand
They don't realise
You hide your sadness beneath a painted smile
Ignorance
That light of fools steers a wayward path
And sets the course
Upon which we sail into the night of uncertainty
Following the stars
That make their way across the sky
Valuing the love
That lends grace to our hearts we sail1Embed
