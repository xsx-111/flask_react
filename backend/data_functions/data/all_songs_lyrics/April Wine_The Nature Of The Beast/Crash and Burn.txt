Crash and Burn LyricsThey call it the burnout-factor, and only the good die young
Somebody's gonna take their life, just tryin' to have some fun
The paper's gonna say we're crazy, no matter what they say, yeah
You know I'm gonna Rock all night, gonna Rock all night and day
Whenever they quote you man, you'll be misunderstood
They're never gonna get it right, or tell it the way they should
Maybe we move too fast to put it all in a song
And, if we keep pushin' ourselves we won't be around too long
If you wanna try it
Crash and burn, crash and burn
Crash and burn, crash and burn all night long
Some people like to take it easy, and flow without a sound
Others like to play for keeps, and spread themselves around
I don't wanna say it's right, but if that's where you wanna be
Life's too short to miss out on what you wanna see
If you wanna try it
Crash and burn, crash and burn
Crash and burn, crash and burn all night long

Come on now, honey, don't tell me the way I ought to be
You know I don't need nobody talkin' back to me
Hey, I'm gonna live my life the way I think I should
You know I wouldn't change a thing, even if I could
I tell it like it is!
Crash and burn, crash and burn
Crash and burn, crash and burn
Baby, crash and burn
I said, crash and burn
I said, crash and burnEmbed
