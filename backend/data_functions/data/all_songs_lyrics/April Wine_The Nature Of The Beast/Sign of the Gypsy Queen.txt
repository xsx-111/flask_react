Sign of the Gypsy Queen LyricsLightning smokes on the hill arise
Brought the man with the warning light
Shouting loud, "You had better fly!"
While the darkness can help you hide
Trouble's comin' without control
No-one's stayin' that's got a hope
Hurricane at the very least
In the words of the gypsy queen
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Get my saddle and tie it on
Western wind, who is fast and strong
Jump on back, he's good and long
We'll resist 'til we reach the dawn
Runnin' seems like the best defense
Stayin' just don't make any sense
No-one could ever stop it now
Show the cards of the gypsy town
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go

Shadows movin' without a sound
From the hold of the sleepless town
Evil seems to be everywhere
Heed the spirit that brought despair
Trouble's comin' without control
No-one's stayin' that's got a hope
Hurricane at the very least
In the words of the gypsy queen
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you goEmbed
