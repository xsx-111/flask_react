One More Time LyricsThe man in the back smokes a pack and a half
Sayin "One more time before we go!"
The lady in the front wants to roll with the punches
Just one more shot and then she'll know
Everybody's feelin' alright
Runners on an endless flight, so high
One more time before we go
One more song on the radio
One more time before we go
One more song on the radio
The pretty boys stand just as close as they can
Silhouetting lovers, such a sight
Nobody stares, hey, why should they care
You are what you are tonight
Tomorrow we could all fade away
They only wanna live for today, so high
One more time before we go
One more song on the radio
One more time before we go
One more song on the radio

One more time
The world may be comin' apart
The confusion they're feelin' comes straight from the heart
All they know is the need that they have to be free
So, let 'em, just let 'em be

The world may be comin' apart
The confusion they're feelin' comes straight from the heart
All they know is the need that they have to be free
So, let 'em, just let 'em be
The smoke gets thicker as the night goes on
Shadows dancing through the haze
So outrageous, it's a sonic affair
Only doing as they please
You'll never hear a word about Heaven
Or, what they'd have to do to fly, so high
One more time before we go
One more song on the radio
One more time before we go
One more song on the radio
One more time, yeah, before we go
One more song on the radio
One more time before we go
One more song on the radio
One more timeEmbed
