Future Tense LyricsEach moment's just a reflex
Response is just emotion
The pressure never ends, baby
I hope it don't drive me crazy
I don't wanna be a poor boy
It don't help to say gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
I ain't foolin' myself now
All I know is what I feel
I know I don't like it
You can't disagree
Come on, say it'll be all right
I say yeah, yeah, yeah
Future tense, gone too far
Future tense, a world apart
Future tense, more than a feeling in my heart
Oh, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I feel a little unbalanced
Between the pros and the con-men
I try for satisfaction
You always let it slide
Every day is like the last day
Whatever happened to 50, 50, 50, 50
I don't have a solution
All I know is what I feel, baby
I heard about the good life
I'd like to give it a try
They say it's gonna be alright
I said yeah, yeah, yeah
Future tense, is what I feel
Future tense, is what I see
Future tense, as much for you as it is for me
Oh, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you don't like somebody
Say "Leave me alone!"
It's just like a bad time
You have to make good on your own

We're racing through time now
It's all hit and run
You say it's gonna be alright
I say yeah, yeah, yeah
Future tense, we've gone too far
Future tense, a world apart
Future tense, more than a feelin' in my heart
Oh, no, (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, no, (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, no, (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, no, (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, no, (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, no, (yeah, yeah, yeah)
No (yeah), no (yeah), no (yeah), oh, no!Embed
