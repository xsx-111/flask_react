Wanna Rock LyricsDon't wanna move or get outta bed
That Rock 'n' Roll's going straight through my head
They say I'm stupid, I really don't care
Whatever they say, well I say that's fair
All I wanna do is Rock 'n' Roll
All I wanna do is Rock and Rock some more
Wanna Rock, wanna Rock
Wanna Rock, wanna Rock
Don't waste my money drivin' 'round in a car
Save my money for electric guitars
Disco music's just a social disease
If it don't rock me, then it ain't gonna please me
All I wanna do is Rock 'n' Roll
All I wanna do is Rock and Rock some more
Wanna Rock, wanna Rock
Wanna Rock, wanna Rock
Turn up the music, let's have a good time
Don't pull no punches, lay it right on the line
New Wave, Old Wave, third wave will do
It don't matter when I'm dancin' with you
All I wanna do is Rock 'n' Roll
All I wanna do is Rock and Rock some more
Wanna Rock, wanna Rock
Wanna Rock, wanna RockEmbed
