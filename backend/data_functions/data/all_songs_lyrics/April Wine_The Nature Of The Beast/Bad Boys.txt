Bad Boys LyricsI look out the window, see the fishes get the run-around
I tell the boys I gotta be movin' on
I'm tired of playin' the game, the ending's always the same
Odds are you won't last too long
I can see you, you can't see me
Don't feel shame no more
I'm not here, you're not there
That I know for sure
Bad boys, they call us
Bad boys, they call us
Bad boys
Left on the street to fend for yourself
You do what you can to get by
The choice is run with the pack
You make a take on the sly
This time I'll go it alone
I'm gonna make good on my own
No more of this foolish pride
I can see you, you can't see me
I don't care no more
I'm not here, you're not there
That I know for sure
Bad boys, they call us
Bad boys, they call us
Bad boys

Don't wanna be in a cell
Don't wanna end up in hell
I know I don't like what I see
Don't want it to happen to me
I gotta get out of this town
No sense in hanging around
Time I found out what I want to be
Nobody wants to run, and nobody wants to hide
The moment of truth becomes a burning inside
Hey, look at me, and you'll see
How I've changed my ways
I'm not there, you're not here
Won't have people say
Bad boys, bad boys
Bad boys, see how they run
Bad boys, they call us
Bad boys, they call us
Bad boys, see how they runEmbed
