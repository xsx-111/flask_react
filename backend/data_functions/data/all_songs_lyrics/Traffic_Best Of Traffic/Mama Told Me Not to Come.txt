Mama Told Me Not to Come LyricsWant some whiskey in your water?
Sugar in your tea?
What's all these crazy questions
They are asking me?
This is the craziest party
That could ever be
Don't turn on the lights
Cause I don't wanna see
Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
She said, "That ain't the way to have fun, son"
Open up the window
Let some air into this room
I think I'm almost choking
From the smell of stale perfume
And the cigarette you're smoking
'Bout to scare me half to death
Open up the window
Let me catch my breath!
Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come
She said "That ain't the way to have fun, son
That ain't the way to have fun, son, son, son"
The radio is blasting
Someone's knocking at the door
I'm looking at my girlfriend
She just passed out on the floor
I've seen so many things
I ain't never seen before
Don't know what it is
But I don't wanna see no more
Mama told me not to come
Mama told me not to come (Mama told me she said)
She said "That ain't the way to have fun, no" (no, no)
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
And Mama told me, mama told me
Mana told me, mama told me
Mama told me not to come (Mama told me not to come)
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun" (that's what she said, she said)
"That ain't the way to have fun, no"
"That ain't the way to have fun" (Mama told me)
And Mama told me, mama told me
Mama told me, mama told me
She told me not to come (Mama told me not to come)
"That ain't the way to have fun" (that ain't the way to have fun)
"That ain't the way to have fun, son"
"That ain't the way to have fun" (oh no, no)...
Spoken:
Maybe I should've listenedEmbed
