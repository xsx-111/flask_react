Madame Helga Lyrics
Mary Mary where you been?
You been out all night?
You ain't got no sleep?
She said 'I been dancing in the hills at a place I know'
She said 'an' that's the place where the fireflies glow'

Had to slap my white face
Pull my head from the clouds
And I kept buying 'n' lying 'n' flying, relying
And dying to know what spins your world around

Good morning I missed ya
But ya bringing me down
I saw an Indian roller
Today on the line
It was the forty eighth hour
We fought our forty eighth fight
Madame Helga's folly
Is where I spent last night

She's been married not once not twice but three
And that's the livin' lovin' woman I want me to be
There were pictures and paintings of freaks like me
So I drank with the devil for my company
Had to slap my white face
Pull my head from the clouds
And I kept buying 'n' lying 'n' flying, relying and dying
To know what spins your world around

Good morning I missed ya
But ya bringing me down
I saw an Indian roller
Today on the line
It was the forty eighth hour
We fought our forty eighth fight
Madame Helga's folly
Is where I spent last night
Good morning I missed ya
But ya bringing me down
I saw an Indian roller
Today on the line
It was the forty eighth hour
We fought our forty eighth fight
Madame Helga's folly
Is where I spent last night1Embed
