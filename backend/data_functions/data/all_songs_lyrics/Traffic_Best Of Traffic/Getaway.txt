Getaway Lyrics
Do, do, do, do-do-do do, do
Do, do, do, do-do-do do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Do, do, do, do-do-do do, do
Do, do, do, do-do-do do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do-do

Remember when we were angels
Before we stole cars and when sex and drugs
Lived up in another world
Not a care in the world
Hide and seek, kissing and running
Till you were out of breath in the late night day sun
Until you Mamma called you home
And you didn't wanna go

Fly
High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away
Fly
High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away
Coppers, robbers, cowboys and Indians
Hanging round the corner of the street you lived
How come it felt so far away
Just a stone throw away
Your best friend wasn't someone you worked with
And money from your old man
Would burn a hole in your pocket all day
Not a single debt to pay

Fly
High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away
Fly
High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away


Fly
High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away
Fly
High
Be my getaway
Gotta get away
Fly
High
Be my getaway
Gotta get awayEmbed
