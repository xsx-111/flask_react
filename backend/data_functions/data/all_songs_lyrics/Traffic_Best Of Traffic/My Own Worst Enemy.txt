My Own Worst Enemy LyricsI've just turned twenty six and she was twenty three
She wore a crucifix but never preached at me
We'd stay up all the night until the day was dead
I get the feel of God inside my broken head
Wanna fly away and change my ways
I'll beat myself to death while she sits next to me
I wanna free myself from all this misery
I wanna taste the love and life she gives to me
But I am my own worst enemy
I try to get some sleep, her arms are over me
I'm staring at the walls they're closing in on me
The sun bleeds through the blinds and washes over me
Today's the day I tell myself to set me free
Wanna fly away and change my ways
I'll beat myself to death while she sits next to me
I wanna free myself from all this misery
I wanna taste the love and life she gives to me
But I am my own worst enemy
Feel, wanna feel it, wanna feel it, wanna feel it
Wanna feel it, wanna feel it, wanna feel it, wanna feel it
I wanna fly away and change my ways
I'll beat myself to death while she sits next to me
I wanna free myself from all this misery
I wanna taste the love and life she gives to me
But I am my own worst enemy
Worst enemy, worst enemy, worst enemyEmbed
