Moviestar Lyrics
Analyse tabloid lies
From God to art, you need a star
You're in my soul, you're in my mind
I walk on water every night

Moviestar, dunno where you are
Moviestar, dunno who you are

I love your taste, I love your shape
I love the things about you, all the critics hate
Fill my soul, I once was blind
You turn my water into wine

Moviestar, dunno where you are
Moviestar, dunno who you are

You don't know what it's like
(Here)
You don't know what it's like
(Here)
You don't know what it's like
(Here)
Moviestar
Moviestar
Moviestar
Moviestar
Get me high, you blow my mind
You make my mundane life all worth while
You give me reason, give me rhyme
Do anything for you, just give me a sign

Moviestar, dunno where you are
Moviestar, dunno who you are
Moviestar, dunno where you are
Moviestar, dunno who you areEmbed
