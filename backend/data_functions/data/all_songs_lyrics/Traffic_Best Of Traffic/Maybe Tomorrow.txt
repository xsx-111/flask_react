Maybe Tomorrow Lyrics
I've been down, and I'm wondering why
These little black clouds keep walking around
With me
With me
It wastes time, and I'd rather be high
Think I'll walk me outside and buy a rainbow smile
But be free
They're all free

So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home

I look around at a beautiful life
I've been the upper side of down, been the inside of out
But we breathe
We breathe
I want a breeze and an open mind
I wanna swim in the ocean, wanna take my time
For me
All me
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home


So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
So maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way home
