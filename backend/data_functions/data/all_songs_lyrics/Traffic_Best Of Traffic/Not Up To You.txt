Not Up To You Lyrics
Salt grips the road awaits his lift again
Street orange glow shades the odds against
One more sip
A shoe, A miss
A shaving nick
One extra kiss
Whose to know whatever!

Not up to me, Not up to you
Not up to me, Not up to you

The swings don't swing the parks been dead for years
How do you know the last swing weren't your last for good
Hard book on freaks
Fresh summer peach
Creased magazine
Sugar chocolate treat
Whose to know whatever!

Not up to me, not up to you
Not up to me, Not up to you
The street's so long where she lost her pocket purse
Kept the last picture of the man she committed first
Cracked windscreen rain
French murder play
Junk take away
Tired street parades
Who's to know whatever! Whatever!

Not up to me, Not up to you
Not up to me, Not up to you
Ha, Whatever

Not up to me, Not up to you, Not up to anything we do
Not up to me, Not up to you
Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!

It's not up to me
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to youEmbed
