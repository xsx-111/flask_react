Climbing The Wall Lyrics
I'm just lying here thinking to myself again
I'm round the bend
I've been driving round talking to myself again
Not making no sense

What makes you and what makes me
What makes men lie through their teeth
And what makes ten-ton birds fly me across the sea

And who's to say that if the sun goes out today
That all the movie stars will drive their cars away
Fallen angels from their pay cheques on parade
What's going down?
What's going around?
I'm climbing the wall

I'm just standing here looking at myself again
I'm going blind
I'm just sitting here playing with myself again
It's turning me on

So what makes you and what makes me
What makes women lie through their teeth
What makes ten-ton ships sail me across the sea
And who's to say that if the sun goes out today
That all the movie stars will drive their cars away
Fallen angels from their pay cheques on display
What's going down?
What's going around?
I'm climbing the wall

So what makes you and what makes me
What makes people lie through their teeth
What makes ten-ton trains rail me under the sea

And who's to say that if the sun goes out today
That all the movie stars will drive their cars away
Fallen angels from their pay cheques on parade
What's going down?
What's going around?
I'm climbing the wallEmbed
