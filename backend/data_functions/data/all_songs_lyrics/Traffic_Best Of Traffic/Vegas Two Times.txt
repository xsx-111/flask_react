Vegas Two Times Lyrics
So it started
With the immigration information bore
You gotta know, gambling floor
Then to the S.T.U.D.I.O 54, you gotta go

Now we're leaving
L.A.S Vegas two times
Crazy horse too spent us dry
Vietnam vet taxi ride, L.A.S Vegas

So we parked at the ground floor, front door
Car hire, room for four, we gotta go
Rambling slow to the L.A Marquis
All the imitation folk, we gotta go

Now we're leaving
L.A.S Vegas two times
Crazy horse too spent us dry
Vietnam vet Taxi ride
L.A.S Vegas

Leave, leave
Leave, leave
Now, we're leaving
L.A.S Vegas two times
Crazy horse to spin us dry
Vietnam vet, taxi ride
Come again we'll make you fly
Vietnam vet taxi ride
Crazy horse too spent us dry
Las Vegas two timesEmbed
