It Means Nothing Lyrics
Did we lose ourselves again?
Did we take in what's been said?
Did we take the time to be
All the things we said we'd be?
Did we bury heads in sand
When my future's in my hands

It means nothing
It means nothing

You can find yourself a god
Believe in which one you want
Cause they love you all the same
They just go by different names
Can you fly your flag today?
Are you proud or just ashamed?

It means nothing
It means nothing
It means nothing
It means nothing
It means nothing
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you
The sun sets in the sky
You're the apple of my eye
If the bomb goes off again
Blows my brain around the train
And I hope that I'm with you
Cause I wouldn't know what to do

It means nothing
It means nothing
It means nothing
It means nothing
It means nothing
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you
If I haven't got you2Embed
