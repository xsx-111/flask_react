Carrot Cake and Wine LyricsI'm looking good got my shoulders back
A few more drinks I'm off to dance
I get the eye as I lift my glass the first time in six months
She looks again I start to shake
My shoulders twitching I'm on my way
Glance behind me for safety's sake
To see a clock the size of a plane
The night is young more fish in the sea
Who's to say she wasn't looking at me?
Sink my head back into my glass
Get into shape for that first dance
I turn away I look to the south
I pull my foot from out of my mouth
To my surprise she's standing beside me
Asking if I'd like to dance
I'm standing in a hall of smoke
Her tongue's in my mouth I'd love to choke
Her knight approaches us on foot
Left his sidekick at the brook
He offers me a cigarette I said I'm far too young to smoke
So he tried to entertain me told me one more crappy
Joke in my ear except the joke wasn't clear
Set the joking aside should I run should I hide?
I've decided to stay rub it straight in his face
What he thought was the case was an easy mistake
I just like to try some carrot cake and wine
Can't I try taste some carrot cake and wine?
Looking good I'm looking back
Knight of her's took her off to dance
I get the eye as I lift my glass but not for the last time
She looks again too drunk to shake
My legs are twitching my eyes are fake
Glance behind me for safety's sake
To see my girlfriend's tongue in the face
Of a friend who is far from a man
Should I hide, should I run?
Must have seen what I've done
I decided to stay like the look on her face
What I thought was the case was an easy mistake
I just like to try some carrot cake and wine
Can't I try taste now carrot cake?
Why can't I try?
Why should I lie?
Taste my
Try some
Buy my
