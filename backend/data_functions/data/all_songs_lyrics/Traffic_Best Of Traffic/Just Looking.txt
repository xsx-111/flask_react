Just Looking LyricsThere's things I want
There's things I think I want
There's things I've had
There's things I wanna have
Do I want the dreams?
The ones we're forced to see
Do I want the perfect wife?
But perfect ain't quite right
Shopping every day
Take it back the next break
They say the more you fly
The more you risk
Your life
I'm just looking
I'm not buying
I'm just looking
It keeps me smiling
A house I've seen
Another coulda' been
You drenched my head
And said what I said
You said that life is what
You make of it
Yet most of us just fake
I'm just looking
I'm not buying
I'm just looking
It keeps me smiling
I'm just looking
I'm not buying
Well I'm just looking
It keeps me trying
And I'm just looking
I'm not buying
Well I'm just looking
It keeps me smiling
There's things I want
There's things I think I want
There's things I've had
There's things I wanna have
They say the more you fly
The more you risk
Your whole life
I'm just looking
I'm not buying
I'm just looking
It keeps me smilingEmbed
