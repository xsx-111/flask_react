Step On My Old Size Nines LyricsI'd like to know what it's all about
What's out there
Am I gonna get old and laugh?
About something
Will I get me a boy or a girl?
Or not either
Will I get what I want from this world?
I'm a day dreamer
Then I watched
The old couple dance
Step on my old size nines
And I'll take you round
I'd like to know what you're all about
What's up there
Are you gonna get old and laugh?
Without a care
Will you get you a boy or a girl?
Or not either
Will you get what you want from this world?
A day dreamer
Then I watched
The old couple dance
Step on my old size nines
And I'll take you round
I'd like to know what we're all about
What we all have done
Am I gonna get old and laugh?
With someone
Think I'll get me a boy and a girl
Or not either
Will I get what I want from this world?
I'm a day dreamer
Then I watched
The old couple dance
Step on my old size nines
And I'll take you 'round.....Embed
