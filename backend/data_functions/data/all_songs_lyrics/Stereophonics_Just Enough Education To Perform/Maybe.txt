Maybe LyricsMaybe one thing
Maybe something
Maybe nothing
All I know is friend, it's nothing new
Maybe it's me
What is to be
Maybe lucky
All, I ask is where we're supposed to be
I give a lot
I take a lot
It's nothing new to me
Maybe you've grown
Am I so wrong
How longs too long
All I want is stuff to be happy
Maybe moving
Always proving
Am I losing
All that's meant to be, that's meant to be
You hear a lot
You told a lot
It's nothing new to me
Maybe laughing
Something lacking
Always sometimes
All I hear is how, it's meant to be
Maybe learning
Always searching
Am I asking things
I'll know too soon, I'll know too soon
We talk a lot
Don't do a lot
It's nothing new to me
I give a lot
I take a lot
It's nothing new to meEmbed
