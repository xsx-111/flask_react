Rooftop LyricsStanding on a rooftop
Tryin' to clear my mind
I only came up to look
But now there's such a crowd
I don't feel that bad
Can't help but laugh
And they cry
"Say jump" and I say, "How high?"
I feel my body blowin'
From every side to side
My mind can't help but knowin'
What it feels like to fly
I don't feel that bad
I can't help but laugh
But they cry,"Say jump" and I say, "How high?"
"Say jump" and I say, "I might"
High, high. high
High, high, high
And they cry out
And they cry out
"Say jump" and I say, "How high?"
"Say jump" and I say, "I'll try"
"Say jump" and I say, "Goodbye"
"Say jump" and I say, "How high?"
High, fly, fly
I'm just standing on the edge
Of somethin' I should try to hide from
I don't know much but I know some things
I need to try, find me a way
Try, I only come out fightin'
I don't feel I should deny them
Can help knowin' what is down there
Feels like I should fly now for them
Fascinated, mis-educated
It's reincarnation of my imagination
I'm far away from here today
It's where I'll stay, if I get my way
It's lyin' awake
It makes me sane
But it makes me sick
But I can't change againEmbed
