Lying In The Sun LyricsWish I could lie in the sun
The same things as anyone
Wish I could lie down there
With my feet high in the air
I'd have a drink in my hand
Read words from a newspaper stand
Wish I could lie in the sun
Wish I could fly like everyone
The same things as anyone
The same things as anyone
But you burn me up, you paint my skin
In bad designs that ain't even in
My skin's crawling up the wall
Into the the ocean I'd love to fall
I hear the sounds but they ain't the same
As feeling them with you two feet away
There's always more worse of than me
Suppose I'm lucky I can even see
All the people that I'd like to be
Passing me by everyday in the street
The same things as anyone
The same things as anyone
But you burn me up, you paint my skin
In bad designs that ain't even in
I got good lungs, I got a good heart
My mind is fit and my feet can walk
Here I am in the shade on the street
Asking people for money to eat
What did I ever do to deserve this?
Did I kill a child or something worse?
The same things as anyone
What's the reason, baby make you feel
How much more fortunate you are than meEmbed
