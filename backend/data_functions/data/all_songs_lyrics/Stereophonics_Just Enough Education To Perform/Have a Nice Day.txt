Have a Nice Day Lyrics
San Francisco Bay, past pier thirty-nine
Early p.m, can't remember what time
Got the waiting cab stopped at the red light
Address, unsure of but it turned out just right

It started straight off: Coming here is Hell
That's his first words, we asked what he meant
He said, "Where you from?" we told him a lot
We take a holiday, is this what you want?

To have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Lie around all day, have a drink to chase
Yourself and tourists, yeah, that's what I hate
He said, "We're going wrong", we've all become the same
We dress the same ways, only our accents change

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Swim in the ocean, that be my dish
I drive around all day and kill the processed fish
It's all money gum, no artists anymore
You're only in it now to it make more, more and more

So have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

Have a nice day
Have a nice day
Have a nice day2Embed
