Watch Them Fly Sundays LyricsI'd
Just like to say
I remember the day
I first woke with you
Some days
I have to admit
The way
We happened to meet
Was strange
Because it was new
Not drinking no more
Not drinking no less
Not sleeping at all
Never in the same bed
Undressed at the bar
Engraved bench in the park
We'd watch them fly Sundays
Fly
Birds round my head
Again
Laughed at the words you
Said
I pushed the boat back to you
I
Flew from the rain
Again
Killed you with what
I said
And you already knew
Not thinking no more
Not drinking no less
Not sleeping at all
Never in the same bed
Undressed at the bar
Engraved bench in the park
We'd watch them fly Sundays
They say
If something should fly
Away
And it comes back to you
Again
Then it's yoursEmbed
