Medication LyricsLiving on medication
Don't wanna know what I've done
Place to place, on the run
Living on medication
Living on medication
Wanted to slow the world down
Make a break concentrate on
Different solution
Realization waves of the soon to learn
Walking oil spill
Living on medication
Nothing can stop us now
Headed for the stratosphere
Living on medication
Destination set, engines on
Drop a toe into the jetstream
Make a break concentrate on
Different solution
Realization waves of the soon to learn
Pollution restitutionEmbed
