Afterglow 61 LyricsUS highway from north to south
It's history breathing
Get out from under the gun
Drive down Highway 61
Hannibal's son saw the Gold Rush
Saw the Civil War done
Then settled down some
On Highway 61
There's no reason to feel downhearted
There's music in the wheels
It's there to be found
"Goodnight Irene" inside the prison walls
Killed a man and lived to sing about it all
Stella 12 on Highway 61
The immigrant son left the mining town
Electrified the traditional
And had it out on Highway 61Embed
