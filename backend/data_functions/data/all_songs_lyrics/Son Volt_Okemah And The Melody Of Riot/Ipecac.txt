Ipecac LyricsHappy hair with fashion eye
Climbed up the Ivory Tower
Just forgot what the game was for
Just forgot what the game was for
Sing the streets of silence
Have to fight the way
From the bone cook up the morning glue
From the bone cook up the morning glue
Find a way to make it work
Leave old bags behind
This ride is a scream
Happy hour turns hearts to dust
Watch out for love like Ipecac
A strange brew we're looking at
Watch out for love like Ipecac
Great buildings of majesty
Made by the rat race whore
Backed by the graves of the laborer's toil
Backed by the graves of the laborer's toilEmbed
