Gramophone LyricsThree generations can't be wrong
Roll around roll around with their favorite songs
Vinyl disc with power to hypnotize
Visions of blues and jump and jive
CHORUS
Colors in sound jump out
Sitting by the gramophone
Same as stoned
If it warms the soul
Takes the strain away
From an ice cold brain
Hillbilly vein in 12-bar time
Juke joints and honky tonks collide
Sing the burdens the hardships of life
Legends through sound survive
CHORUS
Colors in sound jump out
Sitting by the gramophone
Same as stoned
If it warms the soul
Takes the strain away
From an ice cold brainEmbed
