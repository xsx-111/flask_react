Who LyricsA mobile means to make the time
A whirlwind half mast the senses
Shaking your own brand of rhyme
Shaking your own brand of rhyme
On wide avenues the air moves the sound
Cruising around
Who makes the minutes move
The postmeridian new
Who
Who else but you
With gypsy scarf and an old world mouth
A mojo hand brought up from the south
Shaking in your own brand of rhyme
Shaking in your own brand of rhyme
On wide avenues the air moves the sound
Cruising around
Who makes the minutes move
The postmeridian new
Eye level with Goliath's shoes
Spitting out these well worn blues
Eye level with Goliath's shoes
Spitting out these well worn bluesEmbed
