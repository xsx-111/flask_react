6 String Belief Lyrics
Written about to death
Around for another breath
The cops will ebb
The masses will flow
Killed by consolidation
Killed by saturation
The underground will correct
With reaction, rebellion

Rock and roll around my head
Alive and kicking
Rock and roll around my head
50 watts happening
Rock and roll around my head
And like a six string belief

The Declaration framed the States
Revolution sets the course straight
It was necessary then
And it's necessary now
Corruption in the system
A grassroots insurrection
Can bring them down
Will bring them down
Rock and roll around my head
Alive and kicking
Rock and roll around my head
50 watts happening
Rock and roll around my head
Like a six string belief5Embed
