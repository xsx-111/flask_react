Atmosphere LyricsLove is the pavement
With spit in your heart
Slow diamond's no laughter
Sweep the hellhound trail
Translate the faces
Wash off the dust
Smoke plume twilight
American tears
Prairie burnt eyes tell the hell and break through the lens
Feed the buildings by the coast a flagrant dance
Wounded in the world by a single twist of hate
It's all over now
You're headed for the atmosphere
You're headed for the atmosphere
Pick up the blessings
Meet the new sky
Summoned to live up to
The speculation din
Getting that old time feeling again
Madmen on both sides of the fence
Getting that old time feeling again
Madmen on both sides of the fence
Melody of riot in the wilderness of oxygen
Mercy on the waterfall mist in the
Middle class seaEmbed
