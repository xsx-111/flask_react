Endless War LyricsBrought up in the neighborhood of restlessness
Brought up in the neighborhood without dreams
Brought up in the neighborhood around death
We all discover the right time to open our eyes
Still trying to understand
How another wrong makes a right
The world needs another young life
Outside forces of brutality
Rekindle bad blood with a walk on sacred ground
Not here to pass judgement or to criticize
Blame to share mistakes to go around
Still trying to understand
How another wrong makes a right
The world needs another young life
When morning brings news of wasted life
When video brings footage of children dying
No moral face to the endless war
No moral face to the endless warEmbed
