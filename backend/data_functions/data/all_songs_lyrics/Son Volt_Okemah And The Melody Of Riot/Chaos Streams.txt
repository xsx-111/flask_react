Chaos Streams LyricsThe faces we carried broke apart
Believe in the powered distance fade
From the dying dust a marauding shine
For the shedded skin and soul
Smile upon the chaos streams
Turning point calm awaits you
Stop running 60 miles around in circles
Making your blood run blue
Catching releases panacea you go
Concealing the breakage in our hearts
From the dying dust a marauding shine
For the shedded skin and soul
Smile upon the chaos streams
Turning point calm awaits you
Stop running 60 miles around in circles
Making your blood run blueEmbed
