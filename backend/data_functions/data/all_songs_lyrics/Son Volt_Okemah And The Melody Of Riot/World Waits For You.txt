World Waits For You LyricsWhen the world wants right and wrong
Could you break me the news
If i asked you to lie
Would you tell me the truth
In this darkest hour
A brave face will break soon
The world waits for you
The world waits for you
Could you carry me through
It's hard to wake up
Fateful hands that we find
Promises bogged down
Just charms to climb
In this darkest hour
A brave face will break soon
The world waits for you
The world waits for you
Could you carry me through
Find stregnth from the words
Of those that went before
Take what you needEmbed
