Indoor Games Lyrics
Indoor fireworks amuse your kitchen staff
Dusting plastic garlic plants they snigger in the draught
When you ride through the parlour
Wearing nothing but your armour

Playing indoor games

One string puppet shows amuse your sycophantic friends
Who cheer your rancid recipes in fear they might offend
Whilst you loaf on your sofa
Sporting falsies and a toga

Playing indoor games, indoor games

Your mean teetotum sins arouse your seventh wife
Who pats her sixty little skins and reinsures your life
Whilst you sulk in your sauna
'Cause you lost your jigsaw corner

Playing indoor games, indoor games
Each afternoon you train baboons to sing
Or swim in purple perspex water wings
Come Saturday jump chopper, Chelsea brigade
Hard bender-trender

It's all indoor games

No ball bagatelle incites your children to conspire
They slide across your frying pan and fertilise your fire
Still you and Jones go madder
Broken bones, broken ladder
Hey ho
Yeah, hahahaha, hey hoEmbed
