Lady of the Dancing Water Lyrics
Grass in your hair
Stretched like a lion in the sun
Restlessly turned
Moistened your mouth with your tongue
Pouring my wine, your eyes caged mine
Glowing
Touching your face, my finger strayed
Knowing

I called you lady of the dancing water


Oh, lovely lady of the dancing water

Blown autumn leaves
Shed to the fire where you laid me
Burn slow to ash
Just as my days now seem to be
I feel you still, always your eyes
Glowing
Remembered hours, salt, earth and flowers
Flowing
Farewell, my lady of the dancing water1Embed
