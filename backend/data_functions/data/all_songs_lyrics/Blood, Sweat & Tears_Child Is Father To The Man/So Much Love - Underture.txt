So Much Love / Underture LyricsMore than enough to last the whole night through
And it's all for you
In the midst of all my darkness baby
You know you came along to guide me
You took pity on a lonely man
When you said you'd stand beside me
I'll never forget you
For that you've done little girl
I'll never turn my back on you for anyone
'cause I've got
So much lovin'
I'm a natural man
So much lovin'
More than enough to last
A whole life through
And it's all for you
When My world was cold and empty
And I needed somebody near me
I called down from on the mountainside
Knowing full well that you'd hear me
And to you that might seem like a little thing
But to me, it's like changing winter to spring
And I've got
So much lovin'
I'm a natural man
So much lovin'
More than enough to last
A whole life through
And it's all for you
Listen to me baby
There's so few women, nowadays
Who understand the soul of a man
And who understand
They're only always taken in
Never are free, of a helpin' hand yeah
I know that you, yes I know that ya, know what to do girl
Any trouble comes, I know you're bound to see me through
More than enough
To last the whole life through
'cause I've got
So much lovin'
I'm a natural man
So much lovin'
I want you to understand
So much lovin'
I love you, I love you
So much lovin'Embed
