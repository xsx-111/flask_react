My Days Are Numbered LyricsI woke up and found
No one beside me
No hand to hold onto
And no lips to guide me
What a hard world to face
In the light of an angry sun
Ain't it hard to get on
If you ain't got that someone
And it seems that my days are numbered
Down to a precious few
People I know that
My days are numbered
'cause I can't get it back together
Without you
I see the heaven moonlight
See it drippin' down my window
Flowing like a river
Through the tears that I have cried
I gotta find myself, hey
A reason to go on living
But you can't breathe life into somethin'
That's already died
And it seems that my days are numbered
Down to a precious few
People I know that
My days are numbered
'cause I can't get it back together
Without you
And it seems that my days are numbered
Down to a precious few
People I know that
My days are numbered
'cause I can't get it back together
Without you
Hey Hey
I got ta tell you right now
Every morningEmbed
