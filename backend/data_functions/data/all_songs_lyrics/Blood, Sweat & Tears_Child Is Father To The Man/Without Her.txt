Without Her LyricsI spend the night in a chair
Thinking' she'll be there
But she never comes
And I wake up and wipe
The sleep from my eyes
And I rise, to spend another day
Without her
It's just no good anymore
When you walk through the door
Of an empty room
You go inside and set a table for one
It's no fun
When you have to spend the day without her
We burst the pretty balloon
Took us to the moon
Such a beautiful thing
But it's ended now and it sounds like a lie
If I said I'd rather die
Than be without her
Love is a beautiful thing
When it knows how to swing
And it grooves like a clock
But the hands on the clock
Tell the lovers to the part
And it's breakin' my heart
To spend another day without her
I'll spend the night in a chair
Thinking she'll be there
But she'll never come
And I'll wake up and wipe
The sleep from my eyes
And I'll rise and spend the day without her
Can't go on without her
There's no song without her
Can't go on without herEmbed
