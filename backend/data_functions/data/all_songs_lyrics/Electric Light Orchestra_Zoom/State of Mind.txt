State of Mind LyricsI was goin' 'round the world
I was looking for somewhere
I was searchin' for someone
Who was gonna take me there
Didn't want to do it, 'cause I knew what I'd find
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah
I was thinkin' of the past
I was tryin' to wrack my brain
I was looking at the future
I was trying to play the game
Didn't want to do it, 'cause I knew what I'd find
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah
Sometimes you get lost
Sometimes you get found
In a state of mind
Sometimes you're too high
Sometimes you're too down
It's just a state of mind
Didn't want to do it, 'cause I knew what I'd find
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah
Sometimes you get lost
Sometimes you get found
In a state of mind
Sometimes you're too high
Sometimes you're too down
It's just a state of mind
You think you know it all
Then you think that you know nothing
Can't dance, can't crawl
Maybe you better forget it
Didn't want to do it, 'cause I knew what I'd find
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah
Didn't want to do it, 'cause I knew what I'd find
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah
Didn't want to do it, 'cause I knew what I'd find
You're really only livin' in a state of mind, yeah
State of mind
It's a state of mind
State of mind
State of mind
State of mind
State of mind...Embed
