Toys and Flavors LyricsSwallow up
And then go flush it down
Monday special
Get with the latest sound
So here's a treat
Go waste it's sweetness on the desert air
Brand new sensation
To enjoy if you care
Hey hey hey now!
But are you sure it's what you're looking for
So c'mon don't be late now
It won't be late before its out the door
Toys and flavors
Season saviours
C'mon devour
And cut the edges out
Baby
Hip young thing ain't hip no more
With eagle speed buzzards feed
On crums off the fashion floor
Hey hey hey now!
Are you sure it's what you really need
So c'mon don be late now
It's a one hit guarantee
Toys and flavors
Season saviours
C'mon devour
And cut the edges out
Hey hey hey now!
But are you sure it's what you're looking for
So c'mon don't be late now
It won't be long before it's out the door
Toys and flavors
Season saviours
C'mon devour
And cut the edges out
Toys and flavors
Season savioursEmbed
