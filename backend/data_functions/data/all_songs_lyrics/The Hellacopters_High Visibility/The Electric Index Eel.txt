The Electric Index Eel LyricsElectric eyes keep track of what I'm doing
Extensive index files knows my way
Before I'm movin'
And get the picture developed
Before it's taken
I'm disillusioned but they sure
Know my way 'round
They cast no shadow
Don't make a sound
They're ahead of time
It blows my mind
I'm tied up and it gets me down
I say cold hard facts - you say paranoia
You don't have to react - they got device
To do for 'ya
They know the rhythm before it's
Set in motion
I wanna talk to you
But I know we ain't talkin' alone
Feels like someone else
Is on the phone
Top secrecy
Is blowin'me
I'm tied up and it gets me downEmbed
