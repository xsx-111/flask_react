Paul Stanley LyricsHound dogs they are fighting
In a room with a ten lock door
Waitin' for the second sighting
Plastered to a wall in a store
They got dope they got high
But they never tell the reasons why
Come clean sis' amphetamine
Has gone astray
Manhog takes a look in the mirror
Skins it up around 4:25
Still the picture's not getting clearer
Walks away, rips the joint, take a dive
If you can't cope you can hide
But they'll never let you in on their side
Come clean sisters turpenteen
Have gone away
Come clean fade away the scene
Stay clean perpetuate all means
Electric dreams guitars quarantean
I'm gone awayEmbed
