Throw Away Heroes LyricsTen to one and then it's over
Executives are taking turns
Options lost in dirty water
Got a whole lot left to give
But still you're burned
No one ever said it'd be easy
Got it made got to be the one
Feels so good but then it's gone
Throw away heroes
Disposable smiles
Keep track of pats on your back
In all out style
Time to move, replace the burden
Pass the gloves onto some other hands
Who's that dude I never heard of?
Well he's left the building but he was the shit
He was the man
No one ever said it'd be easy
Got it made got to be the one
Feels so good but then it's gone
Throw away heroes
Disposable smiles
Keep track of pats on your back
In all out style
Throw away heroes
Expendable beats
From God to geek
Now someone else is in your seat
Throw away heroes
Disposable smiles
Keep track of pats on your back
In all out style
Throw away heroes
Expendable beats
From God to geek
Now someone else is in your seatEmbed
