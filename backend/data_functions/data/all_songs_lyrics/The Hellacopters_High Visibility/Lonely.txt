Lonely LyricsPoor little girl born to an modern world - lonely
Teenage angst ridden tried to make
Herself heard - lonely
From a one horse town to a burg twice the size
From being safe and sound to getting
Cramped in lie
It felt real easy so she started to snitch
But the bitchin' came around threw her
Right down the ditch
Never imagined it could turn out so wrong - lonely
Nobody listens 'cuz the story's too long - lonely
She tried to get by to her own little tune
Can't shoot prozac with a neddle and a spoon
Fell flat on her face crawled on her hands
And her knees
Tried to make friends with her enemies
She think's she's got it
She's got it way outta line
Now she's got the attention
If only she weren't so lonelyEmbed
