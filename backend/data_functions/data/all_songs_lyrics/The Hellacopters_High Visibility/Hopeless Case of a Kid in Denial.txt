Hopeless Case of a Kid in Denial LyricsI'm in heavy I'm in deep
I look cool but inside I weep
I'm older but sure ain't as wise
As I pretend to it's mostly all lies
I'm a liar I'm a cheat
Sore loser can't stand defeat
I say it's right but I know I'm wrong
Just want my music when you're playing your songs
I know it doesn't show
But it's time I let you know
Hopeless case of a kid in denial
Got my tongue firmly in cheek
Make up my mind just after I speak
I should do it but I don't
I say I will but you just know I won't
You like the fabs I dig the who
You eat tikka I eat vindaloo
I only drink when I wanna forget
I won't admit it but I do regret
I know it doesn't show
But it's time I let you know
Hopeless case of a kid in denial
I'm in deep I'm in real heavy
Can't kick it even though I try
I feel sick but I don't want you to heal me
I'm a hopeless case of a kid in denial
Yeah I'm a liar and I'm a cheat
Real sore loser can't stand defeat
There ain't a thing that I'll pass my rejection
Getting real close to denial perfection
I know it doesn't show
But it's time I let you know
Hopeless case of a kid in denialEmbed
