I Wanna Touch LyricsShe got me burning
Got a fever and I'm feeling beat
My blood's boiling in a place so special
Between my head and feet
I got my mind made up
But a part of me is about to bust
Sweet Mary my hand's getting hairy
You know I need you oh so much, yes
I wanna touch I wanna touch
I keep looking but a picture's not enough
I wanna touch
She got me reeling
I'm tipsy tossing in my bed
Been rolllng down this road too long
Getting fed up with that worn out spread
I want the real sweet deal
No centerfold'll make me blush
Lucille! Got a lust I wanna kill
You know I need it oh so much, yes
I wanna touch I wanna touch
I keep looking but a picture' s not enough
I wanna touch
She got me shaking
But there's no room for moving in my bunk
I'm seeing double and my pants are in trouble
I'm tired of this right hand funk
I gotta wrap it up
I'm really falling into a rut
Please Jean! I'm strung up on ephedrine
I wanna I wanna yeah yes
I wanna touch I wanna touch
I keep looking but a picture' s not enough
I wanna touch
I wanna touch I wanna touch
I wanna touch I wanna touchEmbed
