Venus in Force LyricsI saw her in lightning
She stood in the rain
Soaked and wet she was fighting
Got off her knees once again
She's dragging me down
But I wanna keep her warm
Still is my coat enough shelter from the storm
I saw her in thunder
Beautiful electric and pale
I saw her go under
Where souls are always for sale
She's getting down to get higher
Persistent she walks with bare feet
She walks thru'brimstone and fire
Think I'll at the crossroad
Head for dead end streetEmbed
