Alright Already Now LyricsSpare me - I don't need your yappin'
I got directions thrown at me
Like I was in need of clues
All nite long - all day, night
Noon, morning same old song
Comes on strong - never ending
Bitching my nerves gone twitching
Come around wanna cook my goose
It's runnin'over and I'm well worth a deuce
Fresh out of patience and I'm getting real bored
Bet your ass I've heard it before
I hear you - but baby you don't move me
I've got enough of your predictions
And I just don't care what to doEmbed
