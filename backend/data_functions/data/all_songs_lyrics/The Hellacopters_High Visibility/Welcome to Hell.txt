Welcome to Hell LyricsI've seen you girl - I've seen you walkin'
'Round for a long long time
I've heard you girl - I've heard you talkin'
Tounge in cheek but it don't rhyme
It's time to move - it's to shake those
Hips to a different beat
I got time to prove - today is dated
And obsolete
When mountains are too high
And their sides are to steep
And rivers run too deep
Offers like this don't come cheap
And you got nothin'but your soul to sell
C'mon down and we will treat you well
Baby welcome to hell
I've been watchin' you - I watched you
Droppin'out sweet torn and frayed
But nothing's stoppin' you - pillpoppin' days
Are over if you come my way
Absolution girl - let it go and be
The ultimate star fucker star
Got the solution girl - let loose
And dance to a different guitarEmbed
