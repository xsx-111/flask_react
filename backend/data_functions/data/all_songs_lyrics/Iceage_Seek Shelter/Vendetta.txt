Vendetta Lyrics
Tired of misbehaving
Call those shots upon those pricks, we're fixing to skin 'em
Every trickster knows there's an onslaught
And every city's flooded with cocaine
Fuck a broken backbone
You're wasted on this site
Did you earn to belong here
This ain't no place for a sightseer
Looking for promotion
Mitigate a problem then dump it in the ocean
Nurse onto these grudges for my sake
Here grievances run within the family
Meddle into interest where business you got none
See yourself deemed a stressor
Every man is someone's successor

Beating on an iron door
You're looking like an animal
Cock the hammer, tuck it in
We keep it close, we keep with kin
Vendetta
Vendetta
I'ma gonna getcha
The plates from which we eat from
Life in the trenches of a Ponzi scheme to come
Cutthroat contract jackleg wildflower
A nettle in the nursery humdrum
Hellbent chasing paper upon a mile of road
Buyer, seller, seller, and buyer
How much are you taking for hire?

Beating on an iron door
You're looking like an animal
Cock the hammer, tuck it in
We keep it close, we keep with kin
Vendetta
Vendetta
I'ma gonna getcha
Vendetta
Vendetta
Vendetta
I'ma gonna getcha
