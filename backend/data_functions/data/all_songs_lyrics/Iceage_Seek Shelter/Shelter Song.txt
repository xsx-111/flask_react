Shelter Song Lyrics
My sign is waiting
Rise up until the curve bends over down
They'll entertain you
Alleviate the now into its ground
We crash and then burn
Water’s rising, hypnotizing slowly as we flow
Gravitate to unlearn
Every meaning soon up heaving

So then you keep turning
And you keep turning around
Keep turning till it all spins off somehow
Dizzy headed banshee of a phosphene capacity

Come lay here right beside me
They kick you when you're up, they knock you when you're down
Some shielding from the fighting
They bеat you from the left, they hit you from thе right
Come lay here right beside me
They kick you when you’re up, they knock you when you're down

Shifting to a lower substation
To let it swirl in the greater around
We become each other's sedatives
Giving shelter till the cloudburst dies down
We crash and then burn
Damn it, I'm short of something to live for
Free me from my thirst
Gravitate to unlearn
Simple abstract, brace for impact
So then you keep turning
And you keep turning around
Keep turning till it all spins off somehow
Dizzy headed banshee of a phosphene capacity

Come lay here right beside me
They kick you when you're up, they knock you when you're down
Some shielding from the fighting
They beat you from the left, they hit you from the right
Come lay here right beside me
They kick you when you're up, they knock you when you're down

Keep turning
And you keep turning around
Keep turning till it all spins off somehow
I’ve been yearning for it all to hit the groundEmbed
