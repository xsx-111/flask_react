Gold City LyricsWe've been nesting, we've been caught up, we've been domesticating
And although it seems so very hard to break with, we've broken it
They say that each day breaks, but this one had not been broken yet
And the neighbors, they've decorated lights on their lawns to guide us there
Shoulder to shoulder we march on, might lead us
Where the bulbs hum themselves into the loaded air
First, therе was I, then there was us
Off goеs the layers, as written in dust
What you have lost, I shall provide
All that you left behind, I'll pick up the supplies
Latch on
Hold still, before I forget
Remain in this passing juncture
Let it swarm, let it sit
It is a constant temporary
Right off of my skin, I can feel yours
A constant temporary
A shaking with a newfound tremor
Gold city
Like bread around a bakers door in famine
There's a detonation waiting to happen
Combusted to a tranquil affection set aflame
Now I don't know where I would be without you
Slit the fruits as we lie in its residue
Transform the dusk to nightfall as we tremble in its wake
First there was I, then there was us
Off goes the layers, as written in dust
What you have lost, I shall provide
All that you left behind, I'll pick up the supplies
Latch on
Hold still, before I forget
Remain in remain in this passing juncture
Let it swarm, let it sit
It is a constant temporary
Right off of my skin, I can feel yours
A constant temporary
A shaking with a newfound tremor
Gold city
