Drink Rain Lyrics
A blueprint for a living with the herd
Life's a moving image that occurred
I’m not too keen on pleasantries
And water is too pure for me
When I'm close to my love

I drink the rain
I drink the rain, all its remains
Drink rain, puddles as grains
I drink rain
To get closer to you

Wetness benefits the firefly
Life is but a flicker then you die
To some the traction of its glow
As ugly as the sullied snow
When I'm close to my love

I drink the rain
I drink the rain, all its remains
Drink rain like iced champagnе
I drink rain
To get closer to you
To get closеr to youEmbed
