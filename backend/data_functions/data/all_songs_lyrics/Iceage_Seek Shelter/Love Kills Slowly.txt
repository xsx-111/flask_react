Love Kills Slowly Lyrics
The tender scent hangs long after the end
Recall those comforts, the failed attempts
A sigh, the long kiss goodnight
Holding onto what isn't mine

But love, love kills slowly
And it burns with every fading memory
Don't you realize, unchained
We have nothing in the end

But love, love kills slowly
Love kills us time and time again
Circumcisions to our skin
Your lips sent into the eclipse
Through your shadows onto our nebula

But love, love kills slowly
And it burns with every fading memory
Don't you realize, unchained
We have nothing in the end

But love, love kills slowly
Love kills silently, love kills closely
Kills slowlyEmbed
