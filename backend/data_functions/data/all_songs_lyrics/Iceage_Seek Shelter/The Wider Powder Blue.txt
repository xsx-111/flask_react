The Wider Powder Blue Lyrics
I heed the call
That of a guiding hand
The one who understands
That blood needs to flow free
Murder can be
Expressed in a million ways
It can be a means to kill
Or a way to teach

Cut the umbilical cord free
You'll find your limbs so feathery
Bygone, carefree bygone
A wayward child was born
And sent a train through my head
And to this day it still carries on

Tracks that rumble roving through
The whole wide world did undo
A commuter once next to you
Soon I'll be long, long gone
As a prospect out of view
Into the wider powder blue
Becomes me, become you, become it all
So you criеd
Like the child you nevеr were
I saw you moving through the air
Steps thumping whispered, yet heard
You weave
Your tears into a hind
Gulps the moment in its greedy breast
From Heaven, across the world to Hell

Struck stone in two where it knew one
Lave ebbed into a loaded gun
Bygone, carefree bygone
A wayward child was born
And sent a train through my head
And to this day it still carries on

Tracks that rumble roving through
The whole wide world did undo
A commuter once next to you
Soon I'll be long, long gone
As a prospect out of view
Into the wider powder blue
Becomes me, become you, become it allEmbed
