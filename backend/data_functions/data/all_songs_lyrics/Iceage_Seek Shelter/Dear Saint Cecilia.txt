Dear Saint Cecilia Lyrics
Busybodies building a Europe of the mind
Bust and banish, fleeting eyes behind Venetian blinds
People care for safety, invoked in evening prayers
Huddled up in mobs, they came to look, but prefer to stare

Red wine stained lips drip dry
Clenching onto dear Saint Cecilia
Gone blind in the dead of night
Lord, I'm aching to retrieve her

Love like an open lemon squeezed into the eyе
Caged like a canary, mangled up and crucifiеd
Short of keepsake in the shattered trophy case
So they're cramming onward through the narrow gate of grace

Red wine stained lips drip dry
Clenching onto dear Saint Cecilia
Gone blind in the dead of night
Lord, I'm aching to retrieve herEmbed
