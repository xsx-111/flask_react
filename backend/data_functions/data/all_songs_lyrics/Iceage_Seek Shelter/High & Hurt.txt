High & Hurt Lyrics
You ain't ready for it
Still, take the throw
Life's a competition, don't you know
So shake 'em down now
They were born to be shaken
Each one's just another undertaking

Living life from the gutter up
Rattle with that unwashed cup
This portion's cooking for you
Shake them jackoffs on down

On a landslide overpouring
'Cross the edges of any brim
A pariah elbowing
As to come forth, just let me in

So there, you sign up but then desert
You pick a, pick a course just to divert
Break it on down

Avarice, the whitened smile, the all-forgiver
Welcomed with wide arms then pulled the trigger
It's a hungry want of flaw
A strike socked in the lower jaw
And then you're swept on through
Boohoo, go on crying babe

On a landslide overpouring
'Cross the edges of any brim
A pariah elbowing
As to come forth, just let me in
"Will the circle be unbroken
By and by, Lord, by and by
There's another home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky"

So there, you go sign up but then desert
You pick a, pick a course just to divert

You get high, you get hurt
You get high, you get hurtEmbed
