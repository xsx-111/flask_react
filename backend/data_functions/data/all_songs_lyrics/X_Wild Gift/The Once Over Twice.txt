The Once Over Twice LyricsI just heard the sad song by another band
Sung by another man
He gave me the once over twice
I said, "When?"
He said, "Okay, so long."
He hung me with the endless rope
I could throw my lipstick and bracelets like gravel
And move to Alabama
I got some more scotch instead
Then I died a thousand times
He hung me with the endless rope
Then I died a thousand times, maybe you don't
But I do, I got a hole in my heart
Size of my heart
Size of my heart
He hung me with the endless rope

I'll see you and I'll raise you off the floor
I'll floor you and we'll dance without a band
I just heard the sad song, hang another man
He hung me with the endless rope
I just heard the sad song by another band
Sung by another man
He gave me the once over twice
I said, "When?"
He said, "Okay, so long."
He hung me with the endless ropeEmbed
