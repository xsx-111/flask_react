Universal Corner Lyrics
Slip around some universal corner
(Like a woman)
Slip around some corner, pick up the phone
(Like a woman)
She must build a fire next to the pay phone
Heat is the point, smoke on the receiver
Light up to its universal ringing
(Like a woman)
Picking it up, her heat finds the night and rises
And rises

She lets you in on her perfect secret
(Like a woman)
She wants a man who knows all the right places
(Like a woman)
Washing his feet with her tears, she'd dry them with her hair
Among the undefiled, she's gone wild
Her sins will sin from behind her
(Like a woman)
Dropping the phone, she leaves it dead to the dead men
The dead men
Screaming Magdalene
So alone, she picks up the phone
Screaming Magdalene
I'm so waiting, is there anyone so waiting?
Screaming Magdalene
She is running

Slip around some universal corner
(Like a woman)
Slip around some corner, pick up the phone
(Like a woman)
She must build a fire next to the pay phone
Heat is the point, smoke on the receiver
Light up to its universal ringing
(Like a woman)
Picking it up, her heat finds the night and rises
And rises

Screaming Magdalene
So alone, she picks up the phone
Screaming Magdalene
I'm so waiting, is there anyone so waiting?
Screaming Magdalene
She is runningEmbed
