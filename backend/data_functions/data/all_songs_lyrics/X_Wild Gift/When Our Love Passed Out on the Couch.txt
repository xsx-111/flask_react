When Our Love Passed Out on the Couch LyricsMake out
When you pass out
On the sofa
Kissing any little child who comes along
I'm gonna leave on
The record
Too loud
For you to hear me spreading technicolor blood

I hate it
I love you
I hate that I need to know what you do
When our love passed out on the couch
When our love passed out on the couch
You're fateful
I'm hateful
And I ruin any kind of fun you have in mind
Like make out
When you pass out
On the sofa
Kissing any little child who comes along

I hate it
I love you
I hate that I need to know what you do
When our love passed out on the couch
When our love passed out on the couchEmbed
