In This House That I Call Home LyricsA hundred lives are shoved inside
Guests arrive to dump their mess
Obedient host and visiting wife
Come outta the bedroom
Straightening clothes

In this house that I call home
In this house that I call home
Nobody knows the party rules
I gotta get in but there's no room
In this house that I call home
In this house that I call home
Beautiful walls are closing in
Looking at you, you're having a nightmare
Stumble over tombstone shoes
I reach to surround you
But it's too soon

In this house that I call home
In this house that I call home
Nobody knows the party rules
I gotta get in but there's no room
In this house that I call home
In this house that I call home
I finally look in your sweet eyes
And somebody comes with a bottle of beer
After he leaves, I turn for a kiss
And see the lady next door
She's naked in the street

In this house that I call home
In this house that I call home
Nobody knows the party rules
I gotta get in but there's no room
In this house that I call home
In this house that I call homeEmbed
