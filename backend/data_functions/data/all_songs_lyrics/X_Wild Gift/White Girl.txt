White Girl Lyrics(She's blonde)
She's blonde
She come along the sidewalk (she's blonde)
Leave a trail of blue and black
Up to you, fighting back
(She's blonde)
Steel chains
A noose of charms on our necks
I find out nothing when we talk and sit
Blue heart passion and watch the set

Easy to fall
Part of your skull
Starts to break away
A cheater's walk
Down the block
Behind this evil street
She's a white girl
But I'm living with a white girl
She's a white girl
But I'm living with a white girl
(Nineteen)
Nineteen
Missing her man for an old girl (nineteen)
Drain every beer left over at home
And listen to ghosts in the other room
(Nineteen)
Why not?
You're alone inside his keeping
I'll replace your drunk old man
Sit in the park and run and hold your hand

Easy to fall
Part of your skull
Starts to break away
Drugged and in love
Out at a club
Pulling me outside
She's a white girl
But I'm living with a white girl
She's a white girl
But I'm living with a white girl
Easy to fall
Part of your skull
Starts to break away
Drugged and in love
Out at a club
Pulling me outside
She's a white girl
But I'm living with a white girl
She's a white girl
But I'm living with a white girlEmbed
