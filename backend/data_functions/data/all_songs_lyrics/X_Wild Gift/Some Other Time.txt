Some Other Time LyricsLet's not talk about bombs
Or the brain impulses of severed limbs
You will always subtract your arms from my arms
Someone always interrupts us when we talk
So I'm gonna draw this evening's line
Before my wash hangs on it for everyone to see

It's very bad luck to draw the line
On the night before the world's end
We can draw the line some other time
This midnight I will
Turn into a beer, I will
Dream of you between nightmares
And wars and toss and turn
Ain't you gonna take me for a ride
Drink and drive down to the L.A. river bed
I'll make no mistakes and I'll behave

It's very bad luck to draw the line
On the night before the world's end
We can draw the line some other timeEmbed
