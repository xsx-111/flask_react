Find Somebody LyricsYou shouldn’t wear the face of sorrow
You must take ups and downs in stride
A brighter day might come tomorrow
Your dream-world door will open wide
You’d better go and find somebody to love
You’d better go and find somebody that needs somebody
To love somebody like you
Now, if you think there’ll be no other
Just change your mind, it isn’t so
Open your heart and you’ll discover
You will see things you did not know
You’d better go and find somebody to love
You’d better go and find somebody that needs somebody
To love somebody like you
Ha!
Ah
The shadow of a fallen angel
Will follow everywhere you go
If once the light of love is able
It will set all your dreams aglow
You’d better go and find somebody to love
You’d better go and find somebody that needs somebody
To love somebody
I want somebody like youEmbed
