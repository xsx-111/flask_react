If You Knew LyricsIf you knew just how I feel
Then you'd know my love is real
If you knew just what I do
You would know my love is true
My love is growing stronger
It really can't wait much longer
Got to know if you're gonna
Play around
Or let me down
If you knew just how I feel
Then you'd know my love is real
If you knew just what I do
You would know my love is true
Is there a way to prove it?
Can't even budge or move it
But I refuse to lose it
So let me know
I won't let go
If you knew just how I feel
Then you'd know my love is real
If you knew just what I do
You would know my love is true
If ever you should care to
You know that I'll be there to
Share anything you dare to
You've got me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
If you knew just how I feel
Then you'd know my love is real
If you knew just what I do
You would know my love is true
My love is true (My love is true)
My love is true (My love is true)
My love is true (My love is true)
My love is true (My love is true)
My love is true (My love is true) (I love)
My love is true (My love is true) (I love)
My love is trueEmbed
