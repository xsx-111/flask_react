Pushed, But Not Forgotten LyricsWould that I could fake my way
Through parlour games and leave without the smell
And have an interesting point of view?
Quoting every latest god
Who prostitutes advice for them to sell
Selecting optimistic songs of praise
Many have been shattered by the fear
Others may risk all to have a clear view
Sanctuary from situations
Ever present in my safest room
Escapes before my hands can find my face
Sitting in my cranium
Avoiding contact with the box of doom
My sense of reason dead before my eyes
Many have been shattered by the fear
Others may risk all to have a clear viewEmbed
