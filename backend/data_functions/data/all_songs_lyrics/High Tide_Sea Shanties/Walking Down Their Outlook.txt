Walking Down Their Outlook LyricsHave you met the gods who have to die?
Served by all and feared by those who cry
Wisdom in the form of tears
Brought to them in cups of fear by you
Wake me from this evil night
Shatter it with rays of light
Through which we'll take to flight
Shedding the nightmare
Nowhere can you run nowhere to hide
Walking down the outlooks they provide
Grave is my love she knows why
We shall live, and never die, do you?
Wake me from this evil night
Shatter it with rays of light
Through which we'll take to flight
Shedding the nightmareEmbed
