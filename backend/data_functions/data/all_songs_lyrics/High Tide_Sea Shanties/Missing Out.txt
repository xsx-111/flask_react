Missing Out LyricsWe just can't take no more
Anger will take no more
Rumbling down again
We're taking over yeah
Baby, prays you know where I've been
Yeah, I've been through your life again
Cry, terrible men
You, want more control again
Here, above you taught me cryin'
Oh, my soul is going down
You're ready, tar him with flaming blue
Conquer, everything on this side
Baby, can you save me?
Yeah, my lie it's all over
Hey, can you save me?
Oh, it's all over...Embed
