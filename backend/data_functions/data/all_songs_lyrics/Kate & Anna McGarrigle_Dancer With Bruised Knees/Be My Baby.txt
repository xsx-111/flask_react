Be My Baby LyricsBe my baby, be my baby, be my baby now
Be my baby, be my baby, be my baby now
There's no one in the world gonna harm you baby
Or lead you down the garden path
With my own two loving arms all around you
I don't know why I live at home
I don't know why I sleep alone
I'm hoping you've no objection
To being the object of my affection
I could keep you warm
With my own two loving arms all around you
Be my baby, we'll go crazy
Dance by the light of the moon
Be my baby and please this lade
Please this lady soon
When the moon's not bright
And the stars aren't right
And the sky is making you blue
Remember that only good can surround you
I don't know why I live at home
I don't know why I sleep alone
I'm hoping you've no objection
To being the object of my affection
I could keep you warm
With my own two loving arms all around you
Be my baby, be my baby, be my baby now...Embed
