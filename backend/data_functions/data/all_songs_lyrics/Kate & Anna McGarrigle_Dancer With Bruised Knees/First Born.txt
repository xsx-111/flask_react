First Born LyricsThe silver spoon's in the mouth
Baby clothes are baby blue
Nothing's ever handed down
Every thing's brand new
News paper notices heralding that great event
Daddy's buddies send the flowers
Mother's friends have baby showers
Welcoming that heaven sent
That first born son is always the one
The first to be called and the last to come
He's his mother's favorite, his grandmother's too
He'll break their hearts and he'll break yours too
For he's the first to creep and the first to crawl
The first to walk and the first to fall
Every bruise is kissed, every cry is heard
Every doubt's cast out with a soothing word
'Cause he's that first born son, he's that special one
No matter what comes next, no matter what comes along
Be it another boy or a sweet baby girl
The family's the oyster and he is the pearl
Some of them make it, some of them don't
Some of them can't, others won't grow up
In the bible of old, according to Exodus
Every first born son of a Jew got axed
But the one who survived with the help of God's hand
Led his people to the promised land
Yes, he's that first born son, he's that son of a gun
Just hates to walk, just loves to run
He loves to run as fast as he can
With life held tight in the palm of his handEmbed
