Kitty Come Home LyricsNo scheme and no direction
With only one way to turn
Pack up all your children
Come home to our love and concern
Kitty come home
No being however mighty
Where chaos reigns alone
Will see his feeble love grow
When cast upon a stone
Kitty come home
Oooh Kitty come home
The birds in the trees call your name
Nothing's changed, all's the same
Home, Come home
Home, Kitty come home
(x2)
All of God's good angels
Need a place to fly
Come be our little seryph
In this paradise
Kitty come home
Home, Kitty come home
Home, Kitty come home
Home, Kitty come home
Home, Kitty come homeEmbed
