Look On LyricsI can't get through
Knots in my mind
I resent
The self I can't find
I can't get through
I can't get through
Oh, a paper and a pencil
Are the best friends I've got
I went to downtown LA
Got picked up by the cops
I didn't get what I wanted
But I didn't care a lot
I saw that life was kidding
Look on, look on, look on
Look on, look on, look on
I'm warning you
I skipped a life
To be here
I've got no right
I'm bad luck
I'm bad luck
Oh, I used to feel a lot
Things used to be alright
So much was going on
I'm empty now inside
When I thought life was terrible
Things were going fine
Vincent called as a set up
Look on, look on, look on 
It's not right
I lost my fame
It's a cheap trick
I wanna do it again
I've got no life
I've got no life
Oh, I am a separate entity
From the guy I was before
Here nobody wants me
I hoped for something more
I flip through empty pages I thought I wrote on
I can't tell what is dreaming
Look on, look on, look on 3Embed
