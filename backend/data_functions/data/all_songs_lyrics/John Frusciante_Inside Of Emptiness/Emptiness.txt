Emptiness Lyrics
And now a minute is trapped
It fell into a crack
Eleven tries leading the way
And then foresight comes

I've lost my sense of it all
The feelings I can't resolve
Circumstances outside convention
And you know I tried
To be part of life

I found the rest of me
I was beaten on down
Emptiness set me free
I lived on a cloud
The walk through the storm
Was like a holiday
I happened to have been warned
Over and over again

The sense of speaking dissolved
Words meanings I couldn't recall
And all I'd found did my losing
I was tough to find
Playing games with my mind
Up the drops that I climbed
In the abyss I was hurled into
By who I brought back into time

I found the rest of me
I was beaten on down
Emptiness set me free
I lived on a cloud
The walk through the storm
Was like a holiday
I happened to have been warned
Over and over again
Over and over again2Embed
