Interior Two LyricsWe fall into the hands of doom
We're coming out interior two
Why don't you come on over and then
Things here will never be the same
We feed the light with shadows of pain
Why don't you come on back again
I hear our song in the wind
I see clouds laughing insane
We fall into forever's lap
We speak when all the lines are tapped
And we endlessly come on back
We come on back
I hear our song in the wind
I see clouds laughing again
Wherever did we find this night?
I'll come back in another life
Why don't you come back over again
Won't you come back over
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come backEmbed
