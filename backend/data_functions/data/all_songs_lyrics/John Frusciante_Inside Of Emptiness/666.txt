666 Lyrics
Something these days in the air
I'm afraid to sing this song
â€˜Cause no one answers me
Got in the way of this one chance of mine
I threw it back
It wasn't gonna last
I jumped ahead
There was a slipstream
One good feeling there
I got out quick
Lower than I go
I'm a pinball
Sticking through a lot
Then down the side wall

The drop!
The drop!

I must have been alone
In the mean time
Nothing comes my way
I'm proud to say
I crossed a line
I said goodbye
This state to recreate
It's the drain of time
I lead you on
There were no days to wait for
No carrying on
Life's still a disease
Help it along
It's a sure thing
Everyone I meet is a laughing star
The drop!
The drop!

You all should walk through a poster
You should see how things align
Change how you see a decline
See how high you really climb
You all should walk through a poster
You should see how things align
Change how you see a decline
See how high you really climb
You all should walk through a poster
You should see how things align
Change how you see a decline
See how high you really climb

The drop!
The drop!
The drop!
The drop!Embed
