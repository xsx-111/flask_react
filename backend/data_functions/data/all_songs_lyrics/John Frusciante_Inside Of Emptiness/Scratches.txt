Scratches LyricsThe scratches of a dark night
The rashes of foresight
And I wanted you
Ooh-hoo-ooh
The weight of my freezing
I had come to you
The face I was given
I have no similarities to
The spaces in the law look
Like the faces in a word book
I get by
I get by
The matches of opportunities
The last thing I've never seen
And I scream to you
Ooh-hoo-ooh
The pain I was needing
Was sort of true
The one aim I was clearing
Was the walls that grew
The crazes I overlooked
The leans into the cook
And I did
And I did
And I was screaming bloody murder
And I was one with pain
And I stopped by the roadside
Cuz it's from where I came
Oh my god
But it's so far away
It would seem accidents
Have gone straight to you
And you've changed your point of view
And the places you're going to
A get crowded
I got crowded
And I'm so glad that you're mine
It twists up the fabric of time
And I'm useless
Yes I'm useless
And the faces are bodies
And your hands are feet
Let me roll around
In things I can't believe
But I tried
Yes I tried
And I tried
You know I tried3Embed
