Super-Tuff LyricsIn the car park, in the lamplight
Go for a walk, clock him shiv-fight
In the car park, in the lamplight
Go for a walk, clock him shiv-fight
Sodium-a-shine on all
The faces white now
And he got his Docs
On bottle out all right now
As you might say, as you might say
As you might say, as you might say
Him super-tuff, him super-tuff
Him super-tuff
In the corner, in the cold rain
Sting like iodine in my brain
In the corner, in the cold rain
Sting like iodine in my brain
Fist you 'til you fall down
Hit him back, make him mad
Really hard, really fast
Have you never been had?
'Cause he's having you now
As you might say, as you might say
As you might say, as you might say
Him super-tuff, him super-tuff
Him super-tuff
As you might say, as you might say
As you might say, as you might
As you might say
Him super-tuff, he's super-tuff
Him super-tuff, him super-tuff
Him super-tuff, he's super-tuff but also tenderEmbed
