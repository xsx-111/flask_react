The Rhythm LyricsHe makes a beeline for the place
Where he gets his only ace
Sometimes he's standing in the rain
Oh, Gene Kelly's hat and cane
He has the rhythm in his head
He has the rhythm in his head
He has the rhythm in his head
He has the rhythm, sing
It's chaotic at the bar
B and O those sweaty drops
We are all mesmerized
To the thing we have inside
He has the rhythm in his head
He has the rhythm in his head
He has the rhythm in his head
He has the rhythm, sing
Inside, outside, West side, East
We kill the beast
Your side, my side, worlds collide, yeah
We kill the beast
We have the rhythm in our head
We have the rhythm in our head
We have the rhythm in our head
We have the rhythm
We have the rhythm in our head
We have the rhythm in our head
We have the rhythm in our head
We have the rhythm, singEmbed
