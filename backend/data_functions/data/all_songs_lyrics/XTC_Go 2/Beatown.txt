Beatown LyricsI spoke to your boss this morning
He asked why you weren't home?
I said sir they left without warning
You won't even get them on the telephone
They're in Beatown, it's a capital city
And all roads lead to Beatown, B-b-beatown
I spoke to your owner this lunchtime
He asked why you weren't home?
I said they thought it was hunchtime
You won't even see them standing on their own
Beatown, it's a capital city
And all roads lead to Beatown, B-B-Beatown
He says he wants his money back sir
He says you're all communists sir
I said they beat you fair and square sir
They use the head and not the fist, sir
They use the head and not the fist
They use the head and not the fist
They use the head and not the fist
They use the head and not the fist
Beatown, Beatown
Beatown, Beatown
Beatown, Beatown
Beatown, Beatown
Beatown, Beatown
Beatown, Beatown
Beatown, BeatownEmbed
