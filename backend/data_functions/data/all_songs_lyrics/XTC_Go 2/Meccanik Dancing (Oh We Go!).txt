Meccanik Dancing (Oh We Go!) LyricsWoolworth beauty
Factory beau
Arm in arm
They must go
To the church of dance with the light on low
Mechanic dancing oh we go
Can't wait until the weekend comes
I want to be with all my chums
Alcohol is an easy key
Helps you unwind
And dance with me
To a disco trot from Germany
I'm standing in front of this girl
I'm under a fluorescent light
I've had a few beers inside me
I feel like a giant tonightEmbed
