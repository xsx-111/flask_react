Red LyricsYou better watch your tape boys
It's the tint that angers the beast
Got their sails in the sunset
They've already got the east
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Oh don't you let them make you
Don't let them make you see red
You better watch your lead boys
It's already in your veins
Did you ever see the color?
Iron turns when it rains
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Don't you let them make you
Don't let them make you see red, red
It's not a gross infatuation
It's not a fear, it's not a crush
It's not any special nation
But even now they make me blush
Red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red
Don't you let them make you
Don't let them make you see
Red
Red
Red
