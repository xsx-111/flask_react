My Weapon LyricsI dunno what she got, I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got, I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got but it seems to have a grip upon me
No telling where she learn the things she do to me
And I don't know what she done wrong but I want to hurt her
Wanna take it out on her, wanna take it out on her
Wanna take it out on her with my weapon
With my weapon, with my weapon, with my weapon
She's so exacting that she tells me when I go wrong
She doesn't value the attention she receives
She says I'm taking all the time but I'm not returning
That's right
I take it out on her, I take it out on her
Well I take it out on her with my weapon
With my weapon, with my weapon, with my weapon
Do this, she won't do that
Lying beside me like a parcel of fat
Hot love, cold sweat feel her beneath me
Wanna crush her to death
She tries to justify the people who despise me
She puts her finger on the things she knows will hurt
And I can't defend myself till we turn the lights off then
I take it out on her, I take it out on her
I take it out on her with my weapon
With my weapon, with my weapon, with my weapon
I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got
I dunno what she got
My stinking weaponEmbed
