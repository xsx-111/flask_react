Life is Good in the Greenhouse LyricsEverybody lives somewhere mud hut igloo
But what I got is the hottest spot and it's away from you
Everybody says something truth lies or both
But dear all your hot air don't encourage growth
Do you wonder why I look so fresh?
Do you wonder why I look so tall?
Do you wonder why you'll never ever move me?
Life is good in the greenhouse
Rather be a plant than be your Mickey Mouse
Life is good in the greenhouse
So everybody eats something but you won't eat me
You won't get me on your plate or have me over for tea
Everybody lives somewhere mud hut or igloo
What I got is the hottest spot and it's away from you
Do you wonder why I look so fresh?
Do you wonder why I look so tall?
Do you wonder why you'll never ever move me?
Life is good in the greenhouse
Rather be a plant than be your Mickey Mouse
Life is good in the greenhouse
Grow
Do you wonder why I look so fresh?
Do you wonder why I look so tall?
Do you wonder why you'll never ever move me?
Life is good in the greenhouse
Rather be a plant than be your Mickey Mouse
Life is good in the greenhouse
Rather be a plant than be your Mickey Mouse
Life is good in the greenhouseEmbed
