I Am the Audience LyricsI am the audience
There's no doubt, no consequence
I could make the morning papers
If I use my capers
Let's be the audience
I might lose my patience
Polite applause accepted
To the ones selected as the audience
Oh I am the audience
No doubt, no consequence
'Cause I'm the audience
Let's be the audience
I might lose my patience
Polite applause accepted
To the ones selected
I am the audience
Breakdown the pretense
No longer be silent
Let's turn to violence
I am the audienceEmbed
