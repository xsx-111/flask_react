Buzzcity Talking LyricsWhat makes you wander far
Don't know who you are
Now if the vibe is right
I'll go out tonight
'Cause it's buzzcity talking
It's buzzcity talking
Go and find a late night bar
If I'm not back, leave the door ajar
It's buzzcity talking
Talking to me
We have sickness in our hair
We have time to spare
You close another door
Break another law when it's
Buzzcity talking
It's buzzcity talking
Go and find a late night bar
If I'm not back, leave the door ajar
It's buzzcity talking
Talking to me
Fast, night goes fast
Ohh
Fast, night goes fast
Ohh
Buzzcity talking
It's buzzcity talking
Go and find a late night bar
If I'm not back, leave the door ajar
It's buzzcity talking
Buzzcity
Buzzcity
Buzzcity
Buzzcity
Buzzcity
Buzzcity
Buzzcity
