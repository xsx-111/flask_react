Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful) LyricsOh, come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant
Oh, come ye oh, come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him, born the king of angels
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord
Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation
Sing all ye citizens of heaven above
Glory to God in the highest
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the LordEmbed
