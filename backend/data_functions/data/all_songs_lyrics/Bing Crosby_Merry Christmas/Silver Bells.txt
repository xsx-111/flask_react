Silver Bells Lyrics
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
Hear them ring, ting-a-ling
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
Hear them ring, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Strings of streetlights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush
Home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids rush
This is Santa's big day
And above all this bustle you'll hear

Silver bells (The corner Santa Claus)
Silver bells (It's busy now because)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, (It fills the winter air)
Hear them ring (You'll hear it everywhere)
Soon it will be Christmas day

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks (Silver bells)
Dressed in holiday style (Silver bells)
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas (It's Christmas time in the city)
Children laughing, people passing (Ring-a-ling)
Meeting smile after smile (Hear them ring)
Very soon it will be Christmas dayEmbed
