Silent Night (1942 Version) Lyrics
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night (Ooo)
All is calm, all is bright (Ooo)
Round yon virgin, mother and child (Ooo)
Holy infant so tender and mild (Ooo)
Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace (Ooo-ooo)Embed
