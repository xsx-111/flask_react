Roman Dog Bird LyricsLysol to get me high
You're sure to smell my fear
Baby you can see-saw sun
And like to be
She once like animal
I can walk but be so free
She walks in like menopause
But I can walk like them
She looks like a well-worn one
I can be one by one look a little word
Half of you can get so sore
I go too well by feel
It's sure to get you there
I'm fade to see
She once like animal
I can walk but be so free
She walks in like menopause
But I can walk like them
She looks like a well-worn one
I can be one by one look a little word
I could've felt no woman like you
Under the well warm dish just fine
I could've felt no woman like you
Under the well warm dish you're fine nowEmbed
