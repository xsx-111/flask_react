Sacrifice LyricsCan you hear the war cry?
It's time to enlist
The people speak as one
The cattle, the crowd
Those too afraid to live
Demand a sacrifice
Demand a sacrifice
Demand a sacrifice of your life
Sacrifice
Can you smell their stinking breath?
Listen to them
Wheezing and gasping and
Chanting their slogans
It's a grave digger's song
Praising God & State
So the Nation will live
So we all can remain as cattle
They demand a sacrifice
They demand a sacrifice
They demand a sacrifice of your life
Sacrifice
Sacrifice
