With Teeth LyricsYou've got the part that's living now
It's a tiny bit nasty
But it's a part now just the same
Have you the time to make it right?
Lord knows I'm gonna let it fly
I know it's not very evil
But you've just got to learn to let it go
Sometimes when the heart beats wide
You can take it on the doves
Like siz the well known water
Like siz the well known war
Like siz the well known water
Like siz the well known warEmbed
