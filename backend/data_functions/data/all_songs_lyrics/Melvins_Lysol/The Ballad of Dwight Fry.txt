The Ballad of Dwight Fry LyricsI was gone for fourteen days
Could have been gone for more
Held up in the intensive care ward
Lyin on the floor
I was gone for all those days
But I was not all alone
I made friends with a lot of people
In the Danger Zone
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my only mind explode
When I'm gone away
I think I lost some weight there
And I really need some rest
Sleeping don't come very easy
In a straight white vest
Shaw'd like to see those little children
She's only four years old
I'd give her back all of her playthings
Even those I stole
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my only mind explode
When I've gone insane
:
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat
And I ran into the street
I saw a man that was choking there
I guess he couldn't breathe
Said to myself this is very strange
I'm glad it wasn't me
But now I hear those sirens callin'
And so I am not free
See my lonely life unfold
I see it every day
See my only mind explode
When I've gone insane1Embed
