Skin Lyrics
I wanna be the one you miss when you're alone
I wanna be the one you're kissing when you're stoned
Back in the alleyway behind your father's home
I'm clawing at your skin, trying to see your bones

I wanna be the one who keeps you up at night
Cling to the memory of how I brushed your sides
'Cause I'm just a puzzle piece trying to fit just right
So I could be someone who's stuck inside your mind

Falling into my sins
You're still in, you're still in my
Skin, skin
I just wish you also felt like this

I wanna be the one who makes your stomach tied
I wanna make a knot and drag you like a kite
'Cause there's a certain pain that keeps you on my mind
When I see your healing skin erase me off your thighs

Falling into my sins
You're still in, you're still in my
Skin, skin
I just wish you also felt like this
With every kiss
Balled up fist, grabbin' at your
Skin, skin
I just wish you also felt like thisEmbed
