Flaw Lyrics
Baby I'm all messed up
Took your bottle, poured a cup
I thought that would fill me up
But maybe it's just a flaw
That I've been havin' all along
In thinking love would be that strong

Baby don't leave me now
I'm talking to your friends for hours
With slipped in kisses on the mouth
I tried my best to work it out
I took you swimming by my house
Went skinny dipping, rip my flowers out

And I choose to let it stew
Oh I choose, choose to blame it all on you
'Cause I don't like the truth

Baby I lost my faith
I kissed him on the second date
Spent the evening at his place
He filled me with a different name
I should have known that some things stain
Love and lust won't feel the same
And I choose to let it stew
Oh I choose, choose to blame it all on you
Yeah I choose, oh I choose to let it stew
Oh I choose, choose to blame it all on you
'Cause I don't like the truth

That none of this was you
I guess it's just a-Embed
