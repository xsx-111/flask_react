Blossom (Wasting All My Time) Lyrics
Wasting all my time wondering if you really loved me
I was wasting all my time thinking 'bout the way you treat me
Wasting all my time on someone who didn't know me
I was wasting all my time on someone who couldn't love me

And I knew when I met you
I'm not the one you wanna be with
'Cause I can't see you blossom in the future that I'm dreamin'

I'll be spending all my time
With someone who really wants me
I'll be spending all my time
With someone who really needs me
'Cause I found someone who has time
To show me they really love me
So I'm not wasting any time
Even though he's still far from me

And I knew when I met him
That he's the one I want to be with
'Cause I can see him
Blossom in the future that I'm dreamin'
So it's not wasting any time1Embed
