Cool Lyrics
Mary has a heart of coal
She’ll break you down and eat you whole
I saw her do it after school, she’s an animal

And she won’t ever love no boy
She’ll treat you like a fucking toy
She’ll break your heart and steal your joy, like a criminal

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that

Mary keeps you off her mind
She wants to spend her weekend right
Out with her friends just getting high, like a stoner girl

And you wait outside on her street
You sit for hours just to see
The girl you pictured in a dream as the only girl
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna know her like you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou
I wanna be that cool
I wanna be that4Embed
