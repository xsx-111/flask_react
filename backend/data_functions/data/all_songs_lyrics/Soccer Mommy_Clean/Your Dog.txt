Your Dog Lyrics
I don't wanna be your fucking dog
That you drag around
A collar on my neck tied to a pole
Leave me in the freezing cold

I don't wanna be your little pet
At the edge of every bed
You sleep in, body stretching out
Guess I'll curl up on the couch

Always talk to other people
Dart my eyes across the room
Forehead kisses break my knees and
Leave me crawling back to you

'Cause I don't wanna be your fucking dog
That you drag around
A collar on my neck tied to a pole
Leave me in the freezing cold

Always talk to other people
Dart my eyes across the room
Forehead kisses break my knees and
Leave me crawling back to you
'Cause I don't wanna be your baby girl
That you show off to the world and
When you decide you wanna feel
Like you're living something real

I'm not a prop for you to use
When you're lonely or confused
I want a love that lets me breathe
I've been choking on your leash10Embed
