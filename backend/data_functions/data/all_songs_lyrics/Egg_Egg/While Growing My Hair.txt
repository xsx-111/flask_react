While Growing My Hair Lyrics
While growing my hair
They heard a strange air
Played on a French horn
All shaven and shorn

Blow your thing, do your mind
Come on in, water's fine
Freak and shout, laugh about
Make sure you're not left out
That's what you have to do
If you want to be one of the few

When just out of school
We felt such a fool
Did I do it wrong?
Some didn't belong

Blow your thing, do your mind
Come on in, water's fine
Freak and shout, laugh about
Make sure you're not left out
That's what you have to do
If you want to be one of the few

Then covered in ink
I had time to think
Daub her for a time
But be clandestine

Blow your thing, do your mind
Come on in, water's fine
Freak and shout, laugh about
Make sure you're not left out
That's what you have to do
If you want to be one of the fewEmbed
