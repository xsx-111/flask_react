Seven Is a Jolly Good Time LyricsI used to play in four time when I was very small
Recently I've realised the folly of it all
So grim a thought disturbed me, upset my decent mind
I started writing songs in all the rhythms I could find
Like five...
Seven is a jolly good time, seven is a jolly good time
It's such a very good sign to play in seven time
Seven is a jolly good time, seven is a jolly good time
It's such a very good sign to play in seven time
I found it hard to follow, my foot became confused
My facial muscles echoed the rhythms that I used
And now I found my m√©tier playing in a group
I gather all the notes up and jump them through a hoop
As in eleven...
Seven is a jolly good time, seven is a jolly good time
It's such a very good sign to play in seven time
Seven is a jolly good time, seven is a jolly good time
It's such a very good sign to play in seven time
It really doesn't matter
It really doesn't matter
It really doesn't matter
It really doesn't matter
(repeat)
Seven is a jolly good time, seven is a jolly good time
It's such a very good sign to play in seven time
Seven is a jolly good time, seven is a jolly good time
It's such a very good sign to play in jolly old seven timeEmbed
