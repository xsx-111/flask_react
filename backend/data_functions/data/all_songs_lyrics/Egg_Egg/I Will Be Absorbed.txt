I Will Be Absorbed LyricsHalf of the time I spend thinking alone
When I'm working out songs or just lying in the sun
The magical sound that I long to express
Always just out of reach of my groping hands
Like the wanton muse
Beckoning to me
Vanishes before
I can see her face
How many times has a transient dawn's
Beauty faded away before you understand
And a woman whose smile is a lingering song
Brings tears to your eyes though you don't know why
Like a fragrant light
Moves before your eyes
A million miles away
Never to return
Wafting past from my childhood
Hazy thoughts and sensations
These must hold the key to my life
I always find those indefinite things
If I manage to touch them they turn into stone
And the quality that kept me following them
Is only a sound that I knew all the time
If I ever find
What I'm looking for
I will be absorbed
And never write againEmbed
