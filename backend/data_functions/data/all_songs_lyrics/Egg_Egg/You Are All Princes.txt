You Are All Princes LyricsMy ears smoke, awaiting the word
My eyes, the apparition
Why don't you speak?
Why hold your arms so
For chasing crows down
Mouth a hole of grief?
(Thirsty of the/First the other) ghost of ??????
Will they come down to me now?
Why don't you speak?
Why hold your arms so
For chasing crows down
Mouth a hole of grief?
Princes
You are all princesEmbed
