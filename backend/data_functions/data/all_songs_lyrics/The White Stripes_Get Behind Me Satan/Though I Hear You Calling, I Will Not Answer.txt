Though I Hear You Calling, I Will Not Answer Lyrics
Round John Virgin
Yeah, you’re right
It’s Round John Virgin
I was wrong
Ponder what’s there
Ponder what’s there, 1, 2, 3

Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
Though I hear you calling
I will not answer

And the sun may shine
Right through your tooth, dear
And the wind may blow
Right through my ear

Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
I broke your code
And I broke your code
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
I broke your code
And I broke your code
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah

Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
Though I hear you calling
I will not answer

And the sun may shine
Right through your tooth, dear
And the wind may blow
Right through my ear

Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
I broke your code
And I broke your code
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah
Come on hit me, yeah, yeah

Though I hear you calling
I will not answer
Though I hear you calling
I will not answer

Though I hear you calling
And the sun is shining
I will not answer
Right through your tooth, dear
The way we plan it
It’s an extra
Because it’s extra convenient
For just three dolla
The way we plan it
It’s an extra
Because it’s extra convenient
For just three dollarsEmbed
