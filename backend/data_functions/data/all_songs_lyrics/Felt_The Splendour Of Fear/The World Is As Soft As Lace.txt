The World Is As Soft As Lace LyricsIf I could I would change the world
But you know my visions they're absurd
And all my great plans get blurred
By the softest touch, the gentlest word

I've said it before and I'll say it again
I will not believe until it is mine
Until it's mine, all mine, yeah mine
If I knew all about this world
Do you think I'd stay here that's absurd
I'd be the brightest star you heard
We'd be the softest lace on earth
