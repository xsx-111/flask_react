Knock Me A Kiss LyricsI like cake
And no mistake
But baby, if you insist
I'll cut out cake
Just for your sake
Baby, c'mon knock me a kiss
I like pie
I hope to die
Just get a load of this
When you get high
Doggone the pie
Baby, c'mon knock me a kiss
When you pressed your sweet little lips to mine
Then I understood
They taste like candy, brandy and wine
Peaches, bananas and everything fine
I love jam and no flim flam
Scratch that off my list
This ain't no jam
The jam can scram
Baby, c'mon knock me a kiss

Yeah baby, when you pressed your sweet little lips to mine
'Twas then I understood oh babe
They taste like candy, brandy and wine
Peaches, bananas an' everything fine
I love jam and no flim flam
Scratch that off my list
This ain't no jam
The jam can scram
Baby, c'mon knock me a kiss
Knock me a kiss
