Run Joe LyricsLoey, Loey, Loey, Loey, Loey
(Loey, Loey, Loey, Loey, Loey)
Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey
(Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey)
Ay the Calypso boys
A-ay child, what is the policeman doing on the premises?
Tell me all about it, child
Moe and Joe had a candy store
Telling fortune behind a door
Cop grabbed Moe and as Joe ran out
Brother Moe then began to shout
(Run Joe) Ay de man at de door
(Run Joe) He man won't let me go
(Run Joe) Run as fast as you can
(Run Joe) Police holding me han'
(Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey)
(Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey)
Ask Juanita to stand me bail
Don't want to sleep in this rotten jail
Hide de crystal ball by de fence
So dey won't find no evidence
When you reach home, get in de bed
Call a doctor and tie your head
Let Juanita invent a lie
Got to have a good alibi
(Run Joe) Ay de man at de door
(Run Joe) De man won't let me go
(Run Joe) Run as fast as you can
(Run Joe) De police holdin' me han'
(Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey)
Get a mouthpiece to talk for me
They'll sure give me de third degree
When dey take me before de sarge
I am going to deny de charge
When de judge ask me how I plead
"Not guilty, sir, most decidedly
You can see, Judge, at a glance
I'm a victim of circumstance"
(Run Joe) Ay de man at de door
(Run Joe) De man won't let me go
(Run Joe) Run as fast as you can
(Run Joe) De police holdin' me han'
(Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey)
(Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey)
I'll be home by de break of day
If de judge believe what I say
If he don't, I'll be lookin' cute
Behind de bars with me striped suit
(Run Joe) Ay de man at de door
(Run Joe) Man he won't let me go
(Run Joe) Run as fast as you can
(Run Joe) De police holdin' me han'
(Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey)
(Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey, Joey)
Me mama told me not long ago
To keep 'way from that worthless Joe
If I heard what me momma say
I wouldn't be in this mess today
(Run Joe) Ay de man at de door
(Run Joe) De man won't let me go
(Run Joe) Run as fast as you can
(Run Joe) De police holdin' me han'
Don't you hear what I told you? (Run Joe)
I done warn you and scold you (Run Joe)
Don't let policeman hold you (Run Joe)
Di'nt your mamma done told you? (Run Joe)
Hey, de policeman is catching up with Joe
Joe run too slow
Hey they're catching up with JoeEmbed
