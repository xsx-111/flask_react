Let The Good Times Roll LyricsHey everybody
Let's have some fun
You only live but once
And when you're dead, you're done
So let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
Don't sit there mumblin'
And talkin' trash
If you wanna have a ball
You gotta go out and spend some cash
And let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
Hey Mr. Landlord, lock up all the doors
When the police comes around
Tell 'em the joint is closed
And let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Don't care if you're young or old
Go out, and let the good times roll
Hey y'all, tell everybody
Mr. Jordan's in town
I got a dollar and a quarter
And I'm just rarin' to clown
But don't let nobody play me cheap
I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep
So let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
Don't care if you're young or old
Get together, let the good times roll
No matter whether it's rainy weather
Birds of a feather gotta stick together
So get yourself under control
Go out and get together and let the good times rollEmbed
