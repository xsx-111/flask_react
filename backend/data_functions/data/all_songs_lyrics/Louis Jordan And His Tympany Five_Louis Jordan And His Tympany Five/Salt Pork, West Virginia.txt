Salt Pork, West Virginia LyricsMack Neal, Mack Neal, don't steal my automobile
I'll take you to a cafe and buy you a fine meal
Jack, I gotta do some ridin'
Soon we gotta come to a dividin'
I don't wanna continue cause the sign says Salt Pork, West Virginia
And that's where my baby lives, and I ain't goin' no further
Yeah, don't you stop me now, I don't wanna commit no murder
Mack Neal, Mack Neal, don't steal my wheel
I'll buy you anything on the menu
Cause boy, I gotta go to Salt Pork, West Virginia
Salt Pork, Salt Pork
Philadelphia (let me off, man, let me off)
Washington (let me off, let me off, that's my stop)
Alexandra (that's mine)
Richmond
Norfolk
Bluefield, what?
