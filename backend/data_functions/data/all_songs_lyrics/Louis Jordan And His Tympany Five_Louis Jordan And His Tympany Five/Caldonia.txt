Caldonia Lyrics
Walkin' with my baby, she got great big feet
She long, lean and lanky ain't had nothing to eat
But she's my baby
And I love her just the same
Crazy 'bout that woman 'cause Caldonia is her name

Caldonia!  Caldonia!
What make your big head so hard? Mouth
I love you, love you just the same
I'll always love you baby 'cause Caldonia is your name

You know, my mama told me to leave Caldonia alone
That's what she told me, no kidding
That's what she said, she said
"Son, keep away from that woman, she ain't no good
Don't bother with her "
But mama didn't know what Caldonia was putting down
So I'm going down to Caldonia's house
And ask her just one more time

Caldonia! Caldonia!
What make your big head so hard? MouthEmbed
