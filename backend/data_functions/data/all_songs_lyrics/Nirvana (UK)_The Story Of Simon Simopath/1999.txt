1999 Lyrics
1999 was a good year
I was born and then I died
So fill your glasses to the brim
And drink the whiskey and the gin

So come on in, have a drink and be merry
In this house, there is plenty of wine
Come on in, have a drink, have some sherry
And drink your drink to 1999

Do you hear the brass band playing?
Donations gratefully received
So fill your glasses to the brim
And drink the whiskey and the gin

So come on in have a drink and be merry
In this house there is plenty of wine
Come on in have a drink have some sherry
And drink your drink to 1999

1999 was a good year
I was born and then I died
So fill your glasses to brim
And drink to 1999
And drink to 1999
And here's to 1999
And drink to 1999
And here's to 19991Embed
