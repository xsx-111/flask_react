I Never Found A Love Like This Lyrics
I never found a love like this before
Is this a dream or was I here before?
I want to stay forever, the Earth was never never
So carry me away to distant land

I never found a love like this before
The stars so bright are shining through my door
I hope they shine forever, as long as we're together
So carry me away to distant land

If you should go, my time will end
Back in my world, it's all pretend
And every day, we'll be a part of every night

I never found a love like this before
Is this a dream or was I here before?
I want to stay forever, the Earth was never never
So carry me away to distant landEmbed
