We Can Help You Lyrics
In the factory and shop, he has tried to make a living
In computer office block, he is hanging by a thread
In the summer of his youth, he is lost in an office jungle
If he tried to understand, he would be a human being

We can help you, we're gonna help you, we're gonna help you
We can help you, today, tonight
We can help you, we're gonna help you, we're gonna help you
We can help you, today, tonight

Simon Simopath is dead like a diamond in the ocean
And his eyes without his face are extended to the sky
He is dreaming of a place that is slightly out of focus
If the Earth was in the sky, he would have his peace of mind

We can help you, we're gonna help you, we're gonna help you
We can help you, today, tonight
We can help you, we're gonna help you, we're gonna help you
We can help you, today, tonight
We can help you, we're gonna help you, we're gonna help you
We can help you tonight
We can help you, we're gonna help you, we're gonna help you
We can help you tonight
We can help you, we're gonna help you, we're gonna help youEmbed
