Satellite Jockey LyricsOut into space for the space of a year
Favourite companion will always be near
You and your lady have left us today
Satellite jockey has gone away and away and away
Satellite jockey out for a year
You and your lady
Favourite companion will always be near
Show us the way
How long can they manage together
Up in the stormy weather?
A year is a very long time
A year is a very long time
A year is a very long time
Satellite jockey, will you be afraid?
You and your lady
Anything can happen in this day and age
Show us the way
How long can they manage together
Up in the stormy weather?
A year is a very long time
A year is a very long time
A year is a very long time
Up into space for the space of a year
Favourite companion will always be near
You and your lady have gone away and away and away
Satellite jockey out for a year
You and your lady
Favourite companion will always be near
Show us the way
Satellite jockey out for a year
You and your lady
Favourite companion will always be near
Show us the way
Five, four, three, two, one, ignitionEmbed
