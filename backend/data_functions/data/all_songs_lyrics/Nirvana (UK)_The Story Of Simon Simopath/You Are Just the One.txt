You Are Just the One Lyrics
I've never had anybody
To talk and walk around with me
I wonder if you could help me
So this could be our lovely day, our lovely day

You are just the one to keep me company
You are just the one to hold me by the hand
I am happy, I am happy, I am happy
I am happy that you tried to understand

Out there ahead, I will take you
The journey will be very long
Abandon all your ideals
Climb up on me, we're flying on, we're flying on

You are just the one to keep me company
You are just the one to hold me by the hand
I am happy, I am happy, I am happy
I am happy that you tried to understand
You are just the one to keep me company
You are just the one to hold me by the hand
You are just the one to keep me company
You are just the oneEmbed
