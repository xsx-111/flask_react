Pentecost Hotel Lyrics
There underneath blue waves, the sunrise spreads blue rays
And Pentecost Hotel sheds all its cobwebs
Explosion of the stars upon the sea in red
And all the guests had seen the water fireworks

And in the lobby, Magdalena is friendly
To all the people with a passport of insanity
And seven sirens are a-dancing to music
In Pentecost Hotel

Strange viaduct of beams, take me to all your dreams
And leave me there as master of the ocean
There underneath blue waves, the sunrise spreads blue rays
And Pentecost Hotel sheds all its cobwebs

And in the lobby, Magdalena is friendly
To all the people with a passport of insanity
And seven sirens are a-dancing to music
In Pentecost Hotel
And in the lobby, Magdalena is friendly
To all the people with a passport of insanity
And seven sirens are a-dancing to music
In Pentecost HotelEmbed
