Take This Hand LyricsDo you take this man? Do you take his hand?
Do you take this man? Do you take his hand?
And the bride wore blue with turquoise on the top
For this was the day when her loneliness would stop
And the hand that she held in sorrow and in joy
Was soft and tender like the small hand of a boy
And the choir did sing in harmony with love
And the smile upon her face was a smile from up above
Do you take this man? Do you take his hand?
Do you take this man? Do you take his hand?
And the bride wore blue with turquoise on the top
For this was the day, when her loneliness would stop
And the hand that she held in sorrow and in joy
Was soft and tender like the small hand of a boy
And the choir did sing in harmony with love
And the smile upon her face was a smile from up above
Do you take this man? Do you take his hand?
Do you take this man? Do you take his hand?3Embed
