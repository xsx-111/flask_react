In the Courtyard of the Stars Lyrics
You are wandering through forests of a lifetime
And then you're holding her hand
When you've cross these bridges and walked these roads
It is time then, it is time to roll in the sand

And they sing to you each night
From the rooftops in the city
And they dance for you each day
In the courtyard of the stars
In the courtyard of the stars, I can see you
I can see you in the courtyard of the stars

Wet eyes, you think of the girl you left behind you
And then vision is dust
You sleep awhile on the beach front city at midnight
And then you play with your lust

And they sing to you each night
From the rooftops in the city
And they dance for you each day
In the courtyard of the stars
In the courtyard of the stars, I can see you
I can see you in the courtyard of the starsEmbed
