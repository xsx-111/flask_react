Lonely Boy Lyrics
Lonely boy, your shadow is so sad
And your empty eyes like two sunsets up on the sky
If I talk about you, I do not dislike you
All I want to do is cry, all I really want to do is cry

Lonely face, your words are wrapped in pain
And you walk the streets to find a place to spend tonight
Should I waken you or should I disregard you?
All I try to do is just in vain, all I try to do is just in vain

Lonely boy, your shadow is so sad
And your empty eyes like two sunsets up on the sky
If I talk about you, I do not dislike you
All I want to do is cry, all I really want to do is cry
All I really want to do is cryEmbed
