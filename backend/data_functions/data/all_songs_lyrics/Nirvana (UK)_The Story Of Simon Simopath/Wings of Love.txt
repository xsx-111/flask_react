Wings of Love Lyrics
Little swallow in the sky
Permit me to entice you with a bargain
I will give you all my sweets
A comic book, a clock that sings

If you will let me have your lovely wings

Silver aeroplane above the clouds
I will shoot you down with gun and bow and arrow
So come down to our front lawn
Ride away with all your things

And let me take away your mighty wings

He wants to be in love, he wants be a butterfly
And he is flying high like the birds into the sky
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly

Lovely angel in my dream
I saw you in the sky today
Your rejoicing amidst the harps
And all the bells and all the rings
If I am good tomorrow, will you let me have your wings?

He wants to be in love, he wants be a butterfly
And he is flying high like the birds into the sky
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly

He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants to fly
He wants to be in love, he wants...Embed
