Midnight Rambler (Live) Lyrics
I'm talkin' 'bout the midnight rambler
Everybody got to go
Well I'm a-talkin' 'bout the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
I'm sighin' down the wind so sadly
A-listen and you'll hear me moan
Well I'm a-talkin' 'bout the midnight gambler
And everybody got to go
Yeah come on

Talkin' 'bout the midnight gambler
The one you never seen before
I'm talkin' 'bout the midnight rambler
Did you see me jump the garden wall?
I don't give you a hoot of warning
A-dressed up in my black cat cloak
I don't see the light of the morning
I'll split the time the cockerel crows

I'm tellin' 'bout the midnight rambler
Well, honey, it's no rock 'n' roll show
Well, I'm a-talkin' 'bout the midnight gambler
And everybody got to go
{​Interlude 1}​
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that, oh don't do that
Don't do that, don't do that
Don't do that, don't do that
Oh don't do that, oh don't do that
{​Interlude 2}
Well alright, oh baby alright
Right right right right, right right
Right right, right right, right right
Right right, right right, right right
Right right, right right, right right
Right right right right
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah

Well, you heard about the Boston...
Honey, it’s not one of those…
Talkin' 'bout the midnight...shit
Did you see me jump bedroom door?
I'm called the hit and run raper, in anger
Or just a knife sharpened, tippy toe
Or just a shoot 'em dead, brain bell jangler
Everybody got to go
If you ever meet the midnight rambler
And he's prowlin' down your marble hall
And he's pouncin' like a proud black panther
You should say, I told you so
If you listen for the midnight rambler
Play it easy, easy as you go
I'll go smash down all your plate glass windows
Put my fist through your stairway doors
Yeah
Yeah
Well I'm a-talkin' bout the midnight rambler
The one you never seen before
Well I'm a-talkin' bout the midnight rambler
And did you see me jump your garden wall?
And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
Steal your mistress from under your nose
Go easy with your cold fanged anger
I'll stick my knife right down your throat baby, and it hurtsEmbed
