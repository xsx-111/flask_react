Little Queenie (Live) Lyrics
(Aw New York City you've talked a lot, let's have a look at you)

I got the lumps in my throat
When I saw her coming down the aisle
I gets the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again standing over by the record machine
Oh, she's looking like a model on the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

Meanwhile, I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got the chance, I ought to take it
She can dance, we can make it
Come on queenie, let's shake it

Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie

Won't you tell me who the queen's
Standing over by the record machine
Why she's looking like a model
On the cover of a magazine
Yeah she's too cute to be a minute over seventeen
Take off your shoes

Meanwhile, I was still thinking
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, that'll get it
If it's good, she'll admit it
Come on, Queenie, let's get with it

Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little Queenie
Go, go, go, little QueenieEmbed
