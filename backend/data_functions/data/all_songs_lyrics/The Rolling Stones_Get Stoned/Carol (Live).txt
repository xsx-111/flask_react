Carol (Live) Lyrics
Oh, Carol
Don't let him steal your heart away
Well I'm going to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

Climb into my machine so we can groove on out
I know a swinging little joint where we can jump and shout
It is not too far back on the highway not so long a ride
You park the car out in the open, you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her ma'am
Because every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I am going to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day


Now, if you want to hear some music like the boys are playing
Hold tight, bang your foot, don't let it carry you away
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Yeah, don't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
Yeah now you can't dance, I know you would you could
I got my eyes on you, sugar, 'cause you dance so good
Oh, Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
I am going to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day

Don't let him steal your heart away
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and dayEmbed
