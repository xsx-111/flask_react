Live With Me (Live) Lyrics
I've got nasty habits
I take tea at three
Yes, and the meat I eat for dinner
It must be hung up for a week
My best friend, he shoots water rats
And feeds them to his geese
Don't you think there's a place for you
In between the sheets?

Come on now, honey
We can build a home for three
Aw come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?

And there's a score of harebrained children
They're all locked in the nursery
They got earphone heads, they got dirty necks
They're so 20th century
Why they queue up for the bathroom
Around about 7:35
Don't you think we need a woman's touch
To make it come alive?
Why you'd look good
Pram-pushing down the high street
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?


Come on now, baby
There's a place between the sheets
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?

Whoa, the servants they're so helpful, dear
The cook she is a whore
The butler has a place for her
Behind the pantry door
The maid, she's French, she's got no sense
She's from the Crazy Horse
And when she strips, the chauffeur flips
The footman's eyes get crossed

Aw come on now baby
There's a place across the street
Come on now, honey
Don't you want to live with me?Embed
