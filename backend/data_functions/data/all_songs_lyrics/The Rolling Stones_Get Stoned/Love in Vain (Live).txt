Love in Vain (Live) Lyrics
Well I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Yeah, I followed her up to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Know it, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain

When the train come in the station
I looked her in the eye
Well the train come in the station
And I looked her in the eye
Whoa, and I feel so sad and lonesome
That I could not help but cry


When the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Yeah, the train it left the station, I tell you
It had two lights on behind
Whoa, the blue light was my blues
And the red light was my mind
I wanna tell you
All my love, all my love
Ah yeah
All rightEmbed
