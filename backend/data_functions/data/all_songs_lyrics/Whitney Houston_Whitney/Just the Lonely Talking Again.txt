Just the Lonely Talking Again Lyrics
It's the second time around
For you and I, boy
And believe me it's confusing me
I'm afraid to say "let's make up" and, all's forgiven
But something tells me I'm headed for heartbreak
So darling, please, I'm praying that
This time it will be different
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize

Tell me are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again

Now, the time before
When we got together
You promised you'd be forever true to me
But all I got from you
Was lots and lots of talking
Lonely nights filled with misery

So baby, please, please tell me now
That when I fulfill your needs
You won't up and leave me
Even though you know I'll let you come back
Tell me
Tell me are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again
Tell me are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it just the lonely talking again
Are you really ready for love, boy
Or is it the lonely talking again
