Love Will Save the Day Lyrics
Sometimes life can make you crazy
It can really put your body to the test
You try so hard to make sure everything goes right
And you find you've only wound up with a mess
It's a common situation
Even though you feel abandoned and alone
Child, you ain't the first to experience the hurt
So don't panic when you hit the danger zone

What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
When you're feeling full of doubt
And fear has got you in a bind
Love will save the day
When your world's falling apart
All you have to do is say a prayer
And love will save the day
There's an answer in your heart
So let your light shine on, my dear
And love will save the day
Love will save the day
Many things in this world bring you down
It's a wonder you can make it through the day
Well, you can't sleep because your problems are too deep
And there's always something getting in the way
And when you turn on the evening news
Mass confusion is the only thing you see
Well, there's no question
That we need a new direction
Because we all could use some peace and harmony

What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice
When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day

What you need's a little change of heart
Forget this fear and frustration
Love will always play the greater part
When your battles wear you down
Here's my advice

When you're feeling down and out
And you've got troubles on your mind
Love will save the day
Love is going to  save the day
You've got to believe it1Embed
