Where You Are Lyrics
I saw the news this morning
Saw your face accross the screen
And as I poured my coffee
I picked up a magazine

But as I turned the page, and looked inside, there you were again
Oh these lonely times, they never seem to end -
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
Today I did some shopping
Just had to clear my mind again
(I can't stop thinking about you)
I hopped into a taxi, seemed
In a moment I was home, home again

But as I turned the page, and looked inside, there you were again
Oh these lonely times, they never seem to end -
You're too far
I know I should be there where you are
Tossing and turning in my sleep
I can't make it without you, now
I'm going to take the next plane out
I got to get to where you are
No matter how near or how far
Or then if you're a star
I know I should be there where you are
But as I turned the page, and looked inside, there you were again
Oh these lonely times, they never seem to end -
You're too far
I know I should be there where you areEmbed
