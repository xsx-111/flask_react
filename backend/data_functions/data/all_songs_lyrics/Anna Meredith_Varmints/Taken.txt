Taken LyricsForecast failing
The heat they said would sweep the land has failed to touch the cold that lines the sides of these four walls
With goodwill trailing
And all our money running out; what seemed a good idea has fast become a fraying waste of time
Sunset-staring was meant to be this nice idea; it's not the moment that we hoped, we'd check our phones, our eyes could meet
Brainstorm-sharing could be the story that we tell ourselves to dam the flood and wash away the legends that we built
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Forecast failing
The heat they said would sweep the land has failed to touch the cold that lines the sides of these four walls
With goodwill trailing
And all our money running out; what seemed a good idea has fast become a fraying waste of time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Taken, taken, taken, taken, taken
Forecast failing
The heat they said would sweep the land has failed to touch the cold that lines the sides of these four walls
With goodwill trailing
And all our money running out; what seemed a good idea has fast become a fraying waste of time
Tension fleeting
Of always everything to say; the space between our words gets longer as the noise our silence built
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Taken, taken, taken, taken2Embed
