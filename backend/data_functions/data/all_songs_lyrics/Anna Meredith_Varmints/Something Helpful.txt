Something Helpful Lyrics
It’s just a different point of view
From how you see
No need to get upset
And walk away those other sides
We haven't finished here
And if we cannot find some solid common ground
Might just have to leave it
Turn down the sleep 'cos 
I don’t care if we're not finished here

Should we make that plan
It’s just a different point of view
From how you see
No need to get upset
And walk away those other sides
We haven't finished here
And if we cannot find some solid common ground
Might just have to leave it
Turn down the sleep 'cos 
I don’t care if we're not finished here
(Say something helpful)
And if we cannot find some solid common ground
Might just have to leave it
Turn down to sleep 'cos
I don’t care if we're not finished here
It’s just a different point of view
From how you see
No need to get upset
And walk away those other sides
We haven't finished here
And if we cannot find some solid common ground
Might just have to leave it
Turn down to sleep 'cos
I don’t care if we're not finished here
Should we make that plan hereEmbed
