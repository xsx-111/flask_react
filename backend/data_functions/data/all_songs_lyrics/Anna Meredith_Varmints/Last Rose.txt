Last Rose Lyrics
'Tis the last rose of summer left blooming alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone
Faded and gone  faded and gone

No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one, to pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
So soon may I follow when friendships decay
And her love's shining circle the gems drop away
Drop away drop away

No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh
When true hearts lie withered and fond ones are flown
Oh who would inhabit this bleak world alone?Embed
