The Lonely Moan LyricsWe caught the sun
It was so simple, so simple
Wrote of heroes unsung
Thoughts exploded on paper
On high, two minds surrendered
How'd you light up the night?
And a man would follow them
Going through some wasted symbols
Mentioning love in every song
We caught the sun
Breathed in superstition
A rose that burned
In the flora of forgotten kisses
Forgotten kisses
Gives in
Breathes out
Turns offEmbed
