Light Up the Night LyricsYou never go out anymore
You planned this from America
Are soldiers have you cry
All others have watched you die
For lighting up the night
For lighting up the night
For living up
Living up
Living up
Living up
You better move on they'd say
You'll never be safe this way
For lighting up the night
For lighting up the night
For lighting up the night
For lighting up the night
For living up
Living up
Living up
Living up
For living up
For living up
Living up
Living upEmbed
