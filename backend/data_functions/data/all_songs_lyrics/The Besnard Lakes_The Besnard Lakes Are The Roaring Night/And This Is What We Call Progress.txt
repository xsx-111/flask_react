And This Is What We Call Progress LyricsSunshine seems so bright
Lonely days, cold nights
No light
Old ghosts in a line
Evil in the mine
Ageless Indian
Can you cast an offering?
'Cause some of us have to hide
All night
Spanish and Indian
Can you make the people reign?
'Cause some of us built too high
Oh why?
Dim the lightsEmbed
