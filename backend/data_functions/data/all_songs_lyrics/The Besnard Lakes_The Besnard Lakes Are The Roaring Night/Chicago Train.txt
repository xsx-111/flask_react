Chicago Train LyricsAlways a long way
I'd watch you all night
Always for all day
I'd wait
I'd find out where you'd stay
For the others
I wait while they take you away
This is the last train to Chicago
No matter where I will go
I'd spy on you
This is the last time I will follow
Wherever you will not be
Neither will me
Lonely we'll be, I'd say
Where will you hide?Embed
