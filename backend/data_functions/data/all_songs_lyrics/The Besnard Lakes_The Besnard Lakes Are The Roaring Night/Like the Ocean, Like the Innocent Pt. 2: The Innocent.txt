Like the Ocean, Like the Innocent Pt. 2: The Innocent LyricsRun from this town with empty arms
Find all your homes, and I'd burn them down
Start all the wars that we wanted to see
And I'd watch them all go by in the cavalcade
Was told where you hide from the short wave
Was sent in the night, in the cold
You're like the ocean, you're like the innocent
What's in your empty eyes?
Deciphered your lines from the short wave
It said: "Kill all the swine, young and old"
Take it off
Take the noose around my neck
Take it offEmbed
