Nosferatu Man Lyrics
I live in a castle
I am a prince
On days I try
To please my queen
Soon as I start to smile
With my smiling queen
Who sits across the table
By the food she made

Like a bat, I flushed the girl
And I flew out my back door
And I came to no one no more
She ran without glances
And railed like a red coal train
She ran without glances
And railed like a red coal train

Eyelids are opened
When the sun is high
I slip away from my queen's
Weary stare
I can be settled down
And be doing just fine
Until I heard that old train
Rolling down the line
With the light she disappeared
And set me in a whirl
And I hope that beautiful girl
I set a fire burning
And I railed on through the night
I set a fire burning
And I railed on through the night

She peeked around the corner
She offered me her hand
My teeth touched her skin
Then she was gone again

Now my queen is lying
In her early grave
After that girl I'll keep alone
There's nothing left to save11Embed
