Good Morning, Captain Lyrics"Let me in," the voice cried softly
From outside the wooden door
Scattered remnants of the ship could be seen in the distance
Blood stained the icy wall of the shore
"I'm the only one left
The storm took them all,"
He managed as he tried to stand
The tears ran down his face
"Please, it's cold"
When he woke, there was no trace of the ship
Only the dawn was left behind by the storm
He felt the creaking of the stairs beneath him
That rose, from the sea to the door
There was a sound at the window then
The captain started (His breath was still)
Slowly, he turned
From behind the edge of the windowsill
There appeared the delicate hand of a child
His face was flushed and timid
He stared at the captain through frightened eyes
The captain reached for something to hold on to
"Help me," he whispered, as he rose slowly to his feet
The boy's face went pale
He recognized the sound
Silently, he pulled down the shade against the shadow
Lost in the doorstep of the empty house
I'm trying to find my way home
And I'm sorry
And I miss you
I miss you
I've grown taller now
I want the police to be notified
But I swear, with this song, I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
I'll make it up to you
I miss you
I miss you
Ah, I miss you
I miss you23Embed
