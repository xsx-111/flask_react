Breadcrumb Trail Lyrics

I stepped out onto the midway
I was looking for the pirate ship and saw this small, old white tent at one end
It was blue and had white lights hanging all around it
I decided to check out the tent, it seemed I could hear music coming from inside
As I walked toward it, I passed a crowd of people at the sideshow
I couldn't figure out why they would want to wait in line
I pulled back the drape thing on the tent
There was a crystal ball at the table, and behind it, a girl wearing a hat
She smiled, and asked me if I wanted my fortune read
I said, "Okay" and sat down
Then I thought about it for a minute, and asked her if she would rather go on the roller coaster instead

Creeping up into the sky
Stopping, at the top, and then starting down
The girl grabbed my hand, I clutched it tight
I said good-bye to the ground

Far below, a soiled man
A bucket of torn tickets at his side
He watches the children run by
And cleans his teeth
Spinning round, my head began to turn
I shouted, and searched the sky for a friend
I heard the fortune teller, screaming back at me
We stuck out our hands and met the wind

The girl falters as she steps down from the platform
She clutches her stomach, and begins to heave
The ticket-taker smiles, and the last car is ready
"Who told you that you could leave?"

The sun was setting by the time we left
We walked across the deserted lot, alone
We were tired, but we managed to smile
At the gate I said goodnight to the fortune teller
The carnival sign threw colored shadows on her face, but I could tell she was blushing17Embed
