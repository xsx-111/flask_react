Don, Aman LyricsDon stepped outside
It felt good to be alone
He wished he was drunk
He thought about something he just said
And how stupid it had sounded
He really should forget about it
And he decided to piss, but he couldn't
A plane passed silently overhead
The streetlights, and the buds on the trees and the night
Were still
It finally came, he took a deep breath
It made him feel strong, and determined
To go back inside
The light
Their backs
Their conversation
The couples, romancing, so natural
His friends stare
With eyes like the heads of nails
The others
Glances
With amusement, with evasion
With contempt, so distant
With malice for being a sty
In their engagement
Like swimming underwater in the darkness
Like walking through an empty house
Speaking to an imaginary audience
And being watched from outside by someone (Someone without a key)
He could not dance to anything
Don left, and drove
And howled, and laughed
At himself
He felt he knew what that was
Don woke up
And looked at the night before
He knew what he had to do
He was responsible
In the mirror
He saw his friend17Embed
