Coming Down Is Calming Down LyricsFacing forwards, sinking in thin air
Help me to learn to breathe again
Facing forwards, I'm sinking in thin air
Help me breathe
I know I've lost my way, so show me
There are demons inside my head
I always let them win, I always let them win
I have to learn to suffocate them
The lost ask for a hand
But I can't stop, I never stop

I've been losing my footing here
I'm all mixed up in this
I need some kind of change
God make it stop, I can't make it stop
This place is getting smaller
Everything in your darkest thoughts about me might be true
I hear the words you say, I still feel nothing
I put my voice out there for you to hear
But the words never made much sense to you
I've lost my path, I'm fading fast
I've lost my path, I'm fading fast
Time is short, time is up
I've been losing my footing here
I'm all mixed up in this
I need some kind of change
God make it stop, I can't make it stop
This place is getting smaller
This is really my plan to get out in one piece
Is this really your plan to keep me lost and on my knees?
I say redemption, I say redemption
Can someone help me hold on?
Can someone help me hold on?Embed
