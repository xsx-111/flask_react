Desperate Times, Desperate Measures Lyrics
I've been crawling around in the dark for a while
Sprawled out across the floor, not collecting dust anymore
Define me a parasite, define my host
Trapped beneath the floor, I slowly waste away

Now I pull my frail body into the chair and look me in the face
Oh, disappointments, so disappointing
This may be my last one, it's gonna be good and hard
It might be a touch out of key, a touch out of key

When this thing breaks
I will be you, you will be me
I'm afraid that this is really happening
When this thing breaks
I will be you, you will be me
Let's hope this is short lived and riddled with disease

Oh God, the noise is ringing in my ear
Its so unclear, so unclear
I hear them talking, but can't make out the words
Speak up, speak clear
I hear them talking, but can't make out the words
Speak up, speak clear
God, where have I been?
I'm a terrible company with zero apologies
My God, where have I been?
Where have I been?
While I sink to the bottom, I'll sing out as it fills with water
I hope I've done enough

When this thing breaks
I will be you, you will be me
Let's hope this is short lived and riddled with disease
When this thing breaks
I will be you, you will be me
I'm afraid that this is really happening

I'm worn out, I'm worn thin
I will never break through
I'm worn out, I'm worn thin
(Where have I been, where have I been?)
I will never break through
(Where have I been?)
Let me out, let me out
Let me outEmbed
