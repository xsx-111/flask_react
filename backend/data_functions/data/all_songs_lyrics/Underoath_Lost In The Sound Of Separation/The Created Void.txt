The Created Void LyricsLet's do this for each other
Let's do this for truth
I give for you, you give for me
I give for you, you give for me
Let me take you somewhere
Somewhere I cannot explain
Let me take you, wanna take you
Somewhere I cannot explain
I'm stumbling right in front of you now
I won't refrain from guiding you there
Normal is not so, normal is not so far
Was it just a dream or something much more?
We are not alone since you agreed to follow
It's all in my head
If you want, you can look inside
There's nothing but red and all the mess I've been
It's all in the way
I say what I don't mean and mean what I don't
I need to speak of you
What is real?
What is real?
What is real?
What is real?
They will never understand what eats at our insides
They will never understand what eats at our insides
It's all in my head
If you want, you can look inside
There's nothing but red and all the mess I've been
It's all in the way
I say what I don't mean and mean what I don't
I need to speak of youEmbed
