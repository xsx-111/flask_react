We Are the Involuntary LyricsJust drifting along with the world
Every motion is paranoid and paralyzing
Give it up or give 'em hope
Let us all survive the wake
We were a race, a human race
Under the glass behind it all
Watch us crawl, watch us crawl so fearfully
I might be wrong after all, I might be wrong
But weren't we just so delicate yesterday?
Sit back and think about it
Sleep it off, sleep on it
Come to, and make your motions
Sit back and think about it
Sleep it off, sleep on it
Come to, and make your motions
Listen up, listen up, listen up
There's a calling ahead
A desperation, a falling of man
We are all lost in the sound, lost in the sound
Lost in the sound of separation
Hands in the air and love at our sides
There's gotta be something bigger here
With the beating in our throats
And the tremble in our grip, this can't be it
I'll come up, I'll come up for peace
I'll come down, I'll come down for truth
I'll give in, I'll give up for you
I'll come up, I'll come up for peace
I'll come down, I'll come down for truth
I'll give in, I'll give up for you
I'll give up, I'll give up, I'll give up, I'll give up
The floors are shaking and we've lost our step
Oh Lord, have mercy, have mercy on us all
The floors are shaking and we've lost our step
Oh Lord, have mercy, have mercy on us all, ohEmbed
