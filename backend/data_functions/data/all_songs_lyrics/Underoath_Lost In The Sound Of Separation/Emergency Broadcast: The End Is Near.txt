Emergency Broadcast: The End Is Near LyricsAt the end of it all we will be sold for parts (Sold for parts)
We will try to rebuild, but we ate it all away (All away)
All ambitions now run dry, someone stop this thing (Turn it off)
In search of new life, nothing will be left to walk the earth again
Turn it off, turn it off
Turn it off
Our hopes and dreams will be swallowed alive
Our hopes and dreams will be swallowed alive
We always said it wouldn't end up like this
Our hopes and dreams will be swallowed alive
We will be the new ice age
We will be the new plague, the new plague
Disguised as a colony
We will wipe them all away
Will wipe them all away
Feast your eyes or just rip 'em out
This is it for us, it's time to panic
Feast your eyes or just rip 'em out
This is it for us, it's time to panic
We always said it wouldn't end
We always said it wouldn't end
We always said it wouldn't end
We always said it wouldn't end
We always said it wouldn't end
(It wouldn't end up, it wouldn't end up like this)
We always said it wouldn't end
(It wouldn't end up, it wouldn't end up like this)
We are the cancer, we are the virus
We are the cancer, we are the virus
Tell me it's not too late
Tell me it's not too lateEmbed
