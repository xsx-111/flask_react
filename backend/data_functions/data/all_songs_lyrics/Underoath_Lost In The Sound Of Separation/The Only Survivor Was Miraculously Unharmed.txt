The Only Survivor Was Miraculously Unharmed LyricsSomeone has sewn me shut and tied me to a bed
They locked me up, locked me up
Oh, God
This is where they all throw me to the wolves:
Dragged behind and trampled on
I can't keep clawing at the jaws of hell
The silence is killing me
Nothing to calm the nerve
Nothing to calm the nerve
Write down my thoughts and read me my rights
Repeat, repeat, repent and repeat
The cycle never really ends 'til they admit that it's real
The cycle never really ends 'til they admit, they admit that it's real
Everything, everything is leaving me wondering
I hate that I'm questioning
Your everything, everything
This is how it seems to me:
I've drowned myself in self-regret
This is how I wanna be, this can't be how I wanna be
They just spin in perfect little circles and that's all that they know
They just spin in perfect little circles and that's all that they know
All that they know
Nothing's right just left alone
Sinking in will be just fine
None of them will ever know
None of them will ever know
Nothing's right just left alone
Sinking in will be just fine
None of them will ever know
None of them will ever know
Nothing's right just left alone
Sinking in will be just fine
None of them will ever know
None of them will ever knowEmbed
