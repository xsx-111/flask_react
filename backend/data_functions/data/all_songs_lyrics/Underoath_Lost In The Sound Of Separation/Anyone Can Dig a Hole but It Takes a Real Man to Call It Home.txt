Anyone Can Dig a Hole but It Takes a Real Man to Call It Home LyricsI'm no leader, I'm just a mess
It's not the way it's supposed to be
It's just the way that it is
I'm afraid we're all victims here
And I'm the one who's in charge
I've lead us all astray again
Oh, how the blood thickens
Are we too far gone?
Are we too far gone?
We always assume the worst
We always assume the worst
I'm afraid no one's listening anymore
I'm freaking out, I'm so sick
I'm making me sick
Don't look down, don't look down
The only thing in my way is myself
I'm just thinking out loud, I'm just thinking
How can I still be alive
I should've been gone so long, so long ago
I can't get away from it all
I messed up like I always do
I gave you nothing, I took you nowhere
You're still listening
I gave you nothing, I took you nowhere
You're still listening
The world around me has taken a turn for the worse
I'm left alone, climbing to the top
Should I jump, should I stay?
Can I make another day?
Should I jump, should I stay?
I am the one who's wrong
I am the one who's wrong
I am the one who's wrong
I am the one who's wrong
God forgive me2Embed
