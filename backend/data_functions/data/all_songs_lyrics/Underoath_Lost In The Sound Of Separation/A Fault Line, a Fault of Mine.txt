A Fault Line, a Fault of Mine LyricsI'm not scared, but this is happening
I'm not afraid, but this is real, this is real
It all comes at once from every single direction
This time I'm not, I'm not sleeping at all
How could this be real
I've failed you, I've failed you

I was lying when I said, I was looking north
I was too scared to show what I am
Bear with me, bear with me this is all I have left
This might be more than a simple conversation, conversation
It's been dancing around in my head for quite some time
Just the thought of cleaning up myself

I was lying when I said, I was looking north
I was too scared to show what I am
Bear with me, bear with me this is all I have left
This might be more than a simple conversation
I'm not sleeping
I'm not sleeping at all
I stare at the wall, watching my time float away
It's all been a blur and nothing will change
I stare at the wall, watching my time float away
It's all been a blur and nothing will change
I was lying (I was lying)
I was lying (I was lying)
I was lying (I was lying)
This is defeatEmbed
