Anyway Anyhow Anywhere LyricsI could go anyway, the way I choose
I could live anyhow, win or lose
I could go anywhere for something new
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose
I can do anything, right or wrong
I can talk anyhow and get along
I don't care anyway, I never lose
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose
Nothing gets in my way, not even locked doors
I don't follow the lines that've been laid before
I get along anyway I dare
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere
I could go anyway, the way I choose
I could live anyhow, win or lose
I can do anything for something new
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose
Anyway
Anyway I choose, yeah
Anyway I wanna go
I wanna go and do myself
Do myself, do myself, yeah
Anyway, the way I choose
Anyway I choose, yeah yeah
Never gonna lose, the way I choose
The way I choose, the way I choose1Embed
