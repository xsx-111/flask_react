Shipwrecked LyricsI'm a million miles from anywhere
Where can I be
Somewhere out on the ocean
Just take a look on the horizon
What can you see ?
There's nothing there for me

I feel shipwrecked
I might as well be shipwrecked
I'm helpless and alone
Drifting out to sea
I can't believe what you said to me
And standing on the corner
Of a busy city street
I still feel so lonely
Why just say you wanna be with me
But the next day say you don't

Without you I feel shipwrecked
But I can't let it show
A million miles away from anywhere
Is it my imagination
Or is it getting darker
Either way it's getting higher
I'm a million miles away from anywhere
A million miles away from anything I know

You know that's why I'm shipwrecked
Shipwrecked
Losing my direction
Please come and rescue me
