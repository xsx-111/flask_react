Cry LyricsLiving here without you
Is not an easy way of life
I spend my time without you
I try to make it worthwile
Standing in a rainfall
Coming down from the sky
Why should I cry over you?
Why should I cry, cry, cry over you?
I keep on thinking about you
I've got no private pride to hide
I've built my world around you
Like a call without reply
My love has lost direction
She's got the sun in her eyes
Why should I cry over you?
Why should I cry, cry, cry over you?
Hearing your footsteps
Loud on my steps
(Awalking...) - living without you
Feeling the sweet sweet smell of love in the air
(I can feel it...) - living without you
Kissing the face
That I see everywhere
But I'm living without you
I'm living without
Why should I cry, cry, cry over you?
Hearing your footsteps loud on my steps
(Awalking...) - living without you
Kissing the face that I see everywhere
But I'm living without you
I'm living without
Cry, cry, cry over you
Why should I cry over you?
Cry, cry, cry over you
Oh oh oh
Cry, cry, cry over you
Why should I cry over you?
Cry, cry, cry over you
(Why should I cry over you?)) oh
Why should I cry, cry, cry over you?
Cry cry why should I cry over you?Embed
