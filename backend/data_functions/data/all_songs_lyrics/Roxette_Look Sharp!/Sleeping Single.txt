Sleeping Single LyricsHere's the house, here's the city and the stream
Here's the father to my dream
Here's the Lost and lonely look in your eyes
When you leave I will break down and cry
Sleeping single - I will wait for you
Sleeping single - 'till you change your mind
Sleeping single - I will wait for you
'till time has gone by
I'll pay the price for all the love you poured like rain
"Toujours l'amour" over again
But the midnight chills are getting so rough
And the bed is big enough for both of us
(I will wait for you)
Sleeping single - I will wait for you
(Won't you change your mind)
Sleeping single - 'till you change your mind
(I will wait for you)
Sleeping single - I will wait for you
'till time has gone by
Sleeping single - I would die for you
(Won't you change your mind)
Sleeping single - won't you change your way
(I will pray for you)
Sleeping single - I will pray for you
To stay he-he-hey...he-he-hey...
'till time has gone by, has gone by
(I will wait for you)
Sleeping single - I will wait for you
(Won't you change your mind)
Sleeping single - won't you change your mind
(I will wait for you)
Sleeping single - I will wait for you
'till time has gone by
Hey, baby I would die for you
(Won't you change your mind)
Sleeping single - won't you, won't you change your way
(I will wait for you)
Sleeping single - I will pray for you
To stay he-he-hey...he-he-hey...
Won't you change your mind
Oh baby, oh ohEmbed
