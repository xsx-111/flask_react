Shadow Of A Doubt LyricsI heard your heart
You held it close to me
The wild embrace, the silent sea
A whisper of imagery for Lovers Supreme
But now, I'm lost in the crowd
No shadow of a doubt
It's all over now
No shadow of a doubt
You changed the dream
You changed the scenery
The tender touch, the urge to breath, oh
There under a lovelit sun what's lost could be found (found, found, found...)
But now, no trace of a sound
No shadow of a doubt
I'm faraway boundd
No shadow of a doubt
But now, I/m lost in the crowd
No shadow of a doubt
It's all over now
No shadow of a doubt
But now, no trace of a sound
No shadow of a doubt
I' faraway bound
No shadow of a doubtEmbed
