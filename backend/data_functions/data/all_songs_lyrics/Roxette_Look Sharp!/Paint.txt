Paint LyricsPaint me right
I've got a hot chilly feeling I don't understand
I;ve got to run through this minute like a hurricaneI
I've got to tighten my wire from the sense to the soul
I find my back to the wall when it's time to go
I've gotta know is that your heart beat?
Paint me right
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I.I'm the pearl
Paint your love all over my world
I've got a love shock/electric from the touch of your hand
I'm gettin' lost in the riddles of the modern man
I've got it up down all around tied to the bone
Hey, there's a strange situation on the late night show
I've gotta know is that your heart beat?
Paint me right
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I, I'm the pearl
Paint your love all over my world
Do it right
I can feel the woman in me tonight
Oh I, I'm the pearl
Paint your love all over my world
Paint me right
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I, I can feel the heat in me
Paint me right
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I, I'm the pearl
Paint your love all over my world
Do it right
I can feel the woman in me tonight
Oh I, I'm the pearl
Paint your love all over my world
Paint your love all over my world
Paint your love all over my world
Paint your love all over my worldEmbed
