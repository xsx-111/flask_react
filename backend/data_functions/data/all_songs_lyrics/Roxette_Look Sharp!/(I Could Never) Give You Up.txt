(I Could Never) Give You Up LyricsI could never give you up
The way you make my true love shine
I've been hiding, lost in the love of another
I've followed the moon and this song
And I thought it would take me forever
To find a place where I belong
I watch a rainbow rise I give you all I've got (got)
I could never give you up
(I could never give you up)
The way you make my love shine
(The way you make my true love shine)
I could never give you up
(I could never give you up)
The way you make true love shine
(The way you make my true love shine)
I believe you when you say you don't want to be lonely
I'll carry your heart like a bridge
When you need all the time you can find
To get the hurt out of your mind
I'll watch the rain go by and give you all I've got (got)
Cause I could never give you up
(I could never give you up)
The way you make my love shine
(The way you make my true love shine)
I could never give you up
(I could never give you up)
The way you make true love shine
(The way you make my true love shine)
I could never give you up!
Give you up
I could never give you up
Give you up
I could never give you up
Give you up
I watch a rainbow rise
I give you all I've got
I could never give you up, the way you make my true love shine(x2)
I could never give you up
(I could never give you up)
The way you make my love shine
(The way you make my true love shine)
I could never give you up
(I could never give you up)
The way you make true love shine
(The way you make my true love shine) (All chorus x2)
Oh, I could never give you up
(I could never give you up)
The way you make my love shine
(The way you make my true love shine)
I could never give you up
(I could never give you up)
The way you make true love shine
(The way you make ny true love shine)
The way you make true love shine
(The way you make my true love shine)x3
I could never give you upEmbed
