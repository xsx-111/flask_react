Chances LyricsGot to got to take chances
Got to got to take chances on me
Got to got to take chances on me
Got to got to take chances
Got to got to take chances
Here my call, here and everywhere
I've been walking the streets in despair
One more fire turns a shade of gray
One more tear is lost in the rain
And I say that I love you
I say that I need you
Baby, I leave you a sign of desire
No shadow will haunt you
No heart will desert you
No will hurt you, no space or no time
Got to got you got to take your chances on me
Like the river will lead the water to the sea
Take on me, take your chances on me
Don't ever let it be, don't ever let it be
There's a night when you close your eyes
Around a dream that shines like the sun
Everyone knows it's beautiful
Tell me why you wanna dream it alone
And I say that I love you
I say that I need you
Baby, I leave you the lines in my palm
No darkness will get you
No heart will desert you
Nothing can hurt you, do you any harm
Got to got you got to take your chances on me (on me)
Like the river will lead the water to the sea
Take on me, take your chances on me
Don't walk away, don't leave
Don't walk away from me
And I say that I love you (and I love you baby)
And I say that I need you
Baby, I leave you a sign of desire
Got to got you got to take your chances on me (on me)
Like the river will lead the water to the sea
Take on me, take your chances on me
Don't ever let it be
Take on me
Like the river will lead the water to the sea
Take on me, take your chances on me
Don't walk away, don't leave
Don't walk away from me
Don't walk away from me
Take on me
Don't walk away from me
Take your chances on meEmbed
