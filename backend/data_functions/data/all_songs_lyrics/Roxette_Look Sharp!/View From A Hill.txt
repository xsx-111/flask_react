View From A Hill LyricsRaging waves sweep this heavy heart
Cold is the colour of the dark
Find a byway and climb that hill
Watch the thunder cast the spell
What did you gain from love?
- Don't ask me!
All for the sweetest thrill...
Chorus
I see a view from a hill - oh oh
I see it perfectly clear
And I cry for the dreams that you kill - oh oh
View from a hill
And it's only a moment awawy, oh oh
Love is a rainfall, hard on the head
No escape though you're soaking wet
Leave me blinded by your light
Leave me stranded alone tonight
What did you gain from love?
- Don't ask me!
All for the cheapest thrill...
I see a view from a hill - oh oh
I see it perfectly clear
And I cry for the dreams that you kill - oh oh
View from a hill
And it's only a motion away
(A motion away) yeah yeah yeah
What did you gain from love?
- Don't ask me!
All for the cheapest thrill...
I see a view from a hill - oh oh
I see it perfectly clear
And I cry for the dreams that you kill - oh oh
View from a hill
And it's only a moment awawy, oh oh
I see a view from a hill - oh oh
I see it perfectly clear
And I cry for the dreams that you kill - oh oh
View from a hill
And it's only a moment awawy, oh ohEmbed
