Nagasaki LyricsHot ginger and dynamite
There's nothing but that at night
Back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky-wacky
Woo
The way they can entertain
Would hurry a hurricane
Back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky wacky
Woo
In Fujiama
You get a mama
Then your troubles increase
In a pagoda
She orders soda
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da. Guarantees
They kissy and huggy nice
By Jingo! I'ts worth the price
Back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky-wacky
Woo
(Orchestral Interlude)
They give you a carriage free
The horse is a Japanee
Back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky-wacky
Woo
They sit you on the floor
And splinter you galore
Back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky-wacky
Woo
With Sweet Kimono
I tried to phone 'er
And found the number engaged
In a pagoda
She orders soda
Ba-da-da-da-da-da. Guaranteed
You just have to act your age
Or wind up inside a cage
Back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky-wacky
Woo
(Gonella ad libs for one line)
In a pagoda
She orders soda
Ba-da-da-da-da-da. Guaranteed
When the girls Ju Jitsu
Seems like a bus hit you
Back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky-wacky
Woo
Back in Nagasaki
Where the fellers chew tobaccy
And the women wicky-wacky
