The Moment Lyrics
In the end, it's stronger than I know how to be
And I can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
I fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want our footsteps to be silent anymore

Want them to be in the moment
Storm clouds are closing

In the end it’s coming, there’s nothing left to do
But I'm still not certain, just how I'm gonna feel

I'll only know in the moment
Anticipation growing

It's getting closer
It's getting closer
It's getting closer
(I'm not ready)
It's getting closer
(I need a little more time)
It's getting closer
(Closer every day)
(Don't cry, we'll be okay)
It's getting closer
(Closer, call of the damned)
(Hold on and breathe if you can)
It's getting closer
(Closer, I'm not ready)
Ooh, it's getting closer
(I need a little more time)
(Breathe if you can)
It's getting closer
(I'm not ready yet)
It's getting closer
(I need a little more time)
It's getting closer
It's getting closer52Embed
