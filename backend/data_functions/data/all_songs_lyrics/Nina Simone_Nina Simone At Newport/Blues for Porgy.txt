Blues for Porgy Lyrics
This song talks about the same Porgy
That we've talked about for two years now
His name is Porgy
Only this one was written by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh

I got my man now, I got Porgy
My baby understands now, I got my Porgy
I'm through with byways, his way is may way, forevermore
Lord, when I feel his arms around me
Knowing he can't go on without me
I wants to beg for a chance to camp at his door

Say he's not much for to look and see
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of love for me

So I'm changing my style, my way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man, got my Porgy now

Though you say he's not much for to look and see
No-no-no-no-no-no
He's lazy and no count as he can be
He's got the kind of love for me
Oh, oh baby, I'm changing my style and way of living
Glad I've stopped taking and started giving
I got my man, I got my Porgy now
Yeah, yeahEmbed
