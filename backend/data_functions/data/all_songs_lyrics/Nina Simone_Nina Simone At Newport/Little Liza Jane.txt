Little Liza Jane Lyrics
Where's my tambourine, wait a minute (Get your tambourine)
Got my tambourine (Get your thing)
(This is what's wrong with you)
Can't forget my tambourine, boy, wait a minute
This is a folk tune and it's called "Little Liza Jane"
We';; get some rhythm started here and see what happens

I got a beau, you ain't got none, little Liza Jane
I got a beau, you ain't got none, little Liza Jane
I got a beau, you ain't got none, little Liza Jane
I got a beau, you ain't got none, little Liza Jane

Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane

(Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane)
Come my love and live with me (Liza Jane)
I will take good care of thee, little Liza Jane
(Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane)
Come my love and live with me (Liza Jane)
I will take good care of thee little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane

(Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane)
Hambone hammer, where you been? (Liza Jane)
Down by the river making gin (Liza Jane)
I know a man that's seven feet tall (Liza Jane)
Drinks his liquor and has a ball (Liza Jane)
Saw him just the other day (Liza Jane)
He had a horse and a bale of hay (Liza Jane)

Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), little Liza Jane (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), little Liza Jane (Liza Jane)

Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
Oh, little Liza, little Liza Jane
(Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane, Liza Jane)
He took me to his great big town (Liza Jane)
Lots of people standing around (Liza Jane)
They were listening to a great big band (Liza Jane)
The bestest music in the land (Liza Jane)
I tell you once and tell you twice (Liza Jane)
Enjoy yourself and live your life (Liza Jane)

Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), Jane, little Liza (Liza Jane)
Little Liza Jane (Liza Jane), little Liza Jane (Liza Jane)
