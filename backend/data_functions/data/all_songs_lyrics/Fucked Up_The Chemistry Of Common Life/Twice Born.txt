Twice Born Lyrics
Hands up if you think you are the only one
Who's been denied, like Peter to God's only son
But what of people who thought he would lift them up?
I guess all of us are the betrayed and the betrayer

We're all the same
We're all the same
In the end, we're all the same

Hands up if you think you are the only one
Who suffered under Pilate like God's only son
What of the money changer at the temple gate?
I guess we are all condemned and the condemners


And over time we let go of our dreams
And our flesh turns grey
And then the flesh turns to bone
And then the bone turns to dust
And then the dust blows away
And everything we were dissipates

Hands up if you think you are the only one
Who was left upon the cross like God's only son
But what of us all that have been left behind?
I guess we are all forsaken or forsakers



And that's how it goes
Everyone you love will let you down
From the bottom, all the way up
Cause in the end, you're not loved
Hands up if you think you're the only one
(Hands up if you think you're the only one)
Hands up if you think you're the only one
(We all have our hands up)
Hands up if you think you're the only one
(Hands up if you think you're the only one)
Hands up if you think you're the only one
(We all have our fucking hands up)

And over time we let go of our dreams
And our flesh turns greyEmbed
