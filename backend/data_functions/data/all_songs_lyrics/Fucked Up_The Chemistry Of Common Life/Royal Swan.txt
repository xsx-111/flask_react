Royal Swan LyricsFeathers collect from the milk and the bones of the dead
Expressions of lives passed away live on in their debt
The journey begins from the tail of a swan at the end
Tributes below color spaces above and the sun
The weight of the world is measured in cells and specks that collect
The foundation compels the ladders of life to reflect and upraise
Reflections of prey charge the predator's gaze
Wearing the face of the quarry, it takes the swan
Shows the blood as a mask on its face
Expressing the water and milk in embrace
And the sun the flames of life extinguish
And fire to impel the distinguished
Beyond the expired the spark is renewed
As the torch is propelled, the swan song crescendo to bid death farewell
The journey ends with a swan at the top
The earth facing the sky as the ultimate sum of the lives
That it chose to survive and shine
Back at the sun to take the world between your bill
(To leave enough and have your fill)
To leave the water but drink the milk
(To spin the wool with silk)
To be a royal swanEmbed
