Days of Last LyricsThe Essenes still wait for the returned Elijah
Pious devotion shackles them to their faith like a slave
The Greek gods watch down from the heights of Mount Zion,
Joking that the worship of the literal doesn't fade with time

Let me re-introduce myself
I am the son of man born, died, deified
All this dogma is bound
No effort to separate the myth from the facts
Fairy tales saying that the end of days have come at last
Was it always this simple and obvious?
We were only held back by faith-based malaise
The hubris of the fallacy that only God can judge me
Was it only arrogance or were we simply that naive?


Oh so convinced that we are manipulated by a divine hand
Oh so convinced that this is part of a divine plan?
Anyone can touch us
Everyone will judge us
And the God above us
He doesn't really love us
You should know
You've spent your whole life figuring it out
So you should knowEmbed
