Son the Father LyricsFather, father, come see what I've built
Made civilization out of the Nile silt
Built your monuments out of my brother's bones
Exalted your words in flesh-bound tomes
It's hard enough being born in the first place
Who would ever want to be born again?
It's taken this long just to get to this place
So what's the point in ever being born again?
Papa, papa, come and watch me play
The whole world before me I laid to waste
Built Jerusalem out of these hidden worlds
But I won't share it with the other boys and girls
It's hard enough being born in the first place
Who would ever want to be born again?
It's taken this long just to get to this place
So what's the point in ever being born again?
More embarrassed than I'd hope to admit
The living embodiment of perfect
A reversed Oedipal complex
Based on power and not on the sex
More embarrassed than I'd ever to admit
The living embodiment of perfect
A reversed Oedipal complex
Based on power and not on the sex
Daddy, daddy, are you proud of me?
I did it all for you because of what I believe
The sins of the father carried out by the son
From Cain and Abel until the last living life is done
It's hard enough being born in the first place
Who would ever want to be born again?
It's taken this long just to get to this place
So what's the point in ever being born again?
Again we stand slack-jawed
As our fates are moved by the hand of God, of God, of God, of God, of God
A God is what we see
As we stare into his Papal eyesEmbed
