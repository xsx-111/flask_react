Magic Word Lyrics
Put a bug into my ear
When I woke up I was here
I blew smoke onto a page and watched the letters re-arrange
Pushed the words into my veins
Tripped the valve inside my brain
Spoke a language I could see
I swam inside reality

Write in vines and speak in tongues
Double meanings in my lungs
Brazen head spits out the skies
These words are heavy, but I'm alright

The tangled web inside my head changed the canvas as it spread
Concepts mushroomed as I talked
Notions opened as I walked
Chemistry is just a word we use to describe
What occurs when subtle changes in our mind make energy from common lives


Things move everywhere, I look, I'm stuck in someone else's book
Letter perfect engineer then it all just disappears
Alright

All of my words became one all the changes were undone
I'm a strange loop, that is clear, put a bug into my earEmbed
