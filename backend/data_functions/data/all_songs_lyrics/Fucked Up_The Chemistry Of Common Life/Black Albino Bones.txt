Black Albino Bones LyricsCan't sleep thinking about it (x4)
Rubbing stones together until the magic comes out
Embracing the purity, the purity of obscurity
Try to capture the name as it spins in your mind
Follow it with our eyes
The dizzy epiphany discovered an artifact of my own
It's the little things that get us through life
Squishing flesh together until the magic comes out
Until we both ejaculate ride the wave
As a little dies, the orgasmic of the fantastic
We well up, and then we explode!
It's the little things that get us through life
I need a little escape (x4)
Burning plants together until the magic comes out
Take it in the inhalate, inhalate what escalates
Hold the vapor deep down inside the toxic fumes
Initiate the levitate
We slowly start to drift off
It's the little things that get us through life
I need a little escape (x4)
Rubbing stones together until the magic comes out
Squishing flesh together until the magic comes out
Burning plants together until the magic comes out
Can't sleep thinking about it (x4)
I need a little escape (x6)1Embed
