Red Neck Friend Lyrics
Pretty little one
How has it all begun?
They're teaching you how to walk
But you're already on the run
Little one
What you gonna do?
Little one
Honey, it's all up to you

Now your daddy's in the den
Shootin' up the evening news
Mama's with a friend
Lately she's been so confused
Little one
Come on and take my hand
Well, I may not have the answer
But I believe I got a plan

Well honey you shake and I'll rattle
And we'll roll on down the line
And see if we can't get in touch
With a very close friend of mine
But let me clue you in, it ain't like him
To argue or pretend
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend
Well they've got a little list of all those things
Of which they don't approve
Well they've got to keep their eyes on you
Or you might make your move
Little one
I really wish you would
Little one
I think the damage would do you good

Well honey you shake and I'll rattle
And we'll roll on down the line
We're going to forget all about the battle
It's gonna feel so fine
'Cause he's the missing link, the kitchen sink
Eleven on a scale of ten
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend


Honey you shake and I'll rattle
And we'll roll on down the line
I'm going to try to swing you up into my saddle
And then we'll run but you'll think we're flyin'
Now honey don't just stand there
Lookin' like this dream will never end
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend
I said, honey let met introduce you to my redneck friendEmbed
