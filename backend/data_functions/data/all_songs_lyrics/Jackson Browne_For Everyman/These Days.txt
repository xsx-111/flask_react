These Days Lyrics
Well I've been out walking
I don't do that much talking these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
For you
And all the times I had the chance to

And I had a lover
But it's so hard to risk another these days
These days
Now if I seem to be afraid
To live the life that I have made in song
Well it's just that I've been losing
For so long

Well I'll keep on moving
Moving on
Things are bound to be improving
These days
One of these days
These days I'll sit on cornerstones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten
My friend
Don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them
