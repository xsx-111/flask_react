Take It Easy Lyrics
Well I'm a-runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load
I got seven women on my mind
Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me
One said she's a friend of mine

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Lighten up while you still can
Don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy

Now I'm a-standin' on the corner in Winslow, Arizona
With such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to have a look at me

Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win
But we will never be here again
Open up I'm climbin' in to take it easy
Well I'm a-runnin' down the road tryin' to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
I'm lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's just a little hard to find

Take it easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy
Come on baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save meEmbed
