Mr. Mathers (Skit) Lyrics
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers!
Mr. Mathers...
Mr. Mathers, can you hear my voice?
Okay, he's not responding
I'm gonna need an 18 gauge, left AC, right away
Uh, BP is 90 over palp, respiration's at eight
Okay, I'm tubing him

DMC, this is medic 41

Medic 41, this is DMC base, MIC. I'm Betty, go ahead

He's cold, spike a bag and grab the backboard

Okay, got it; on three... one, two
Let's move4Embed
