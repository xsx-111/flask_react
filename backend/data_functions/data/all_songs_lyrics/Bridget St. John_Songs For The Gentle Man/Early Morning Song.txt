Early Morning Song LyricsGentle that lies with me
Sleepy we rise in the morning
His eyes are still with me
Taking my time though I know I wonâ€™t find words to tell him what I have been thinking
Over the day lies a beautiful cover
Smothers my body and moves to the other beside
Sleepy tunes roll from my head as I roll out of bed to discover the dayEmbed
