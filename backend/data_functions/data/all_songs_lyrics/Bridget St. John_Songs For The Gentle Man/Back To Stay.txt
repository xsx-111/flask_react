Back To Stay LyricsAlthough I’ve been away so many lonely nights
You know I’m back today
I’m back to stay in your arms
And though I’ve been around
And lived the life I said I loved
You know without you
All I do is worth nothing
And there’s no need for you to cry
Because I’m back today
I’m back to stay in your arms
And though there might be other people in my life
You know on my mind
You will always find there’s only you
And though you say you’ll journey to some foreign land
I will remember you
Yes and I’ll be true to your memory
And there’s no need for you to cry
Because I’m back today
I’m back to stay in your arms
And when at last you do come wandering home to me
I might look at you
But it will be through the weeks between
And whеn I hold you
It might not be you I have
Through the passing days
Wе might both have changed to something new
But there’s no need for you to cry
Because I’m back today
I’m back to stay in your arms
Although I’ve been away so many lonely nights
You know I’m back today
I’m back to stay in your arms
And though I’ve been around
And lived the life I said I loved
You know without you
All I do is worth nothingEmbed
