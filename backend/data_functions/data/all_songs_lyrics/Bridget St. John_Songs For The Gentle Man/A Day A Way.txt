A Day A Way Lyrics
We ran away for a day from the city
Smiled through the rain as we rode to the sea
Just to be just you and me
And the traffic was lazy
And no one would hurry
We thought we would never get by
But in time we were out of the slow city suburbs
Onto the road that reached out for the sea

The fields were all battlefields spattered with trees
Like tired, tattered scarecrows bent over their knees
And the leaves made a litter and covered the land
Lost autumn confetti, a patchwork 
And the wind scrawled a name through the stubble
And stayed with us all the way down to the shore
Where the sea growled before us and spread out her hands
As she plowed through the pebbles to grab at the sand

We ran to the beach with the wittering wind
And scrabbled for shells and mysterious things
Held stones at the waves, fed our feet to the tide
She rose up to take us but we leapt aside
Then the day had to end though we wanted to play there forever
We wished we could stay
And we combed out the spray from our sea-tangled hair
And left for the cityEmbed
