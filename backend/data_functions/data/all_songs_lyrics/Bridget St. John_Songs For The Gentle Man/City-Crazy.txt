City-Crazy Lyrics
I’m a little city-crazy
It is getting out of hand
I need to change my rhythm
For the rhythms of the land
Living in the city’s grip, I feel I lose control
As she reaches for my body
She is hoping for my soul

There is a wilderness of buildings
That are swallowing the ground
They tie us to their chaos
And they try to drag us down
People chasing hours cannot laugh away the years
I’m bewildered by the city
For she turns my fun to fear

I am tired of rushing nowhere
I’ve been dusty far too long
I need to leave and go where I can feel that I belong
I need to sleep on shingle
Yes I wish to step in sand
To move in time to tides and winds
And things I understand
