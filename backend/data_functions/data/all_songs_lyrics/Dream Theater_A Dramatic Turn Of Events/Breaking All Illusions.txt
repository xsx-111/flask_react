Breaking All Illusions Lyrics
With the sun in place, there's a test of faith
Streams of thought awaken
New realities, singularities
Breaking all illusions
“Your living is determined not
So much by what life brings to you
As by the attitude you bring to life
Not so much by what happens to you as by
The way your mind looks at what happens
Out of suffering have
Emerged the strongest souls
The most massive characters
Are seared with scars.”
-Kahlil Gibran
Sudden burst of heat, burning source of life
Masterful destruction
Power's not an act, it's understanding truth
Changing my direction

Live in the moment, breathe in a new beginning
Wisdom revealed as I unlearn to learn
Life's biggest battles often are fought alone
My spirit brings me home
Emerald thoughts flow through my consciousness
Drawn to curses left behind
Test of will the threshold to one's faith
Starts a fire in the mind

Searching out, reaching in
To arrive where I began
Sights remembered in the light


Searching out, reaching in
To arrive where I began
Sounds remembered come alive

Embrace the days
Don't turn away
Life's true intent needs patience
Karma starts the signal!1Embed
