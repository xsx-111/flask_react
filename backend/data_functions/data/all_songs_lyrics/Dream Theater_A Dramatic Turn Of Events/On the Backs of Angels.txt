On the Backs of Angels Lyrics

Standing on the backs of angels
Destined to create
Mounting the attack
While heroes carry your weight
We spiral toward disaster
Survival fading faster

Riding out the wave
Content to feed off the machine
Leading us to death
The new American dream
You're blinded by your hunger
Beware, your days are numbered!

Tears fall from the shameless!
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous!
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter

Blurring lines drawn in between
What is right and what is wrong
Victims on the radar
Straining us along
We're onto your agenda
The dead end road to nowhere
Tears fall from the shameless!
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous!
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter


Tears fall from the shameless!
Shelter me, guide me to the edge of the water
Selfless are the righteous!
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
Selfless are the righteous!
Burden me, lead me like a lamb to the slaughter
