Build Me Up, Break Me Down Lyrics
Today I will be your savior
Tomorrow a demon
You crave my erratic behavior
And watch my every move

Obsession at all cost
You'll be the death of me
Broken and torn apart
Why can't you let me be?

You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
I'm your guilty addiction

Build me up!
Break me down!

(Today... Savior...)
Tonight I am the new messiah
You deify
When I'm no longer desired
I'll be crucified
The one who's free from sin
The first to cast the stone
Fighting the fear within
I won't be left alone
You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
The price I pay
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive
I can't live up
I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
I'm your morbid obsession!

Build me up!
Break me down!



You build me up
You break me down
Until I'm falling to pieces
The price I pay
To live this way
And the fantasy stays alive
I can't live up
I can't let down
And leave you falling to pieces
I crash and burn
I never learn
Your iconic fixation

Build me up!
Break me down!Embed
