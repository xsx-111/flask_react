Spark And Cindy LyricsSpark and Cindy live by their own means
They wouldn't have any if I'd only known where they'd been
And I want to make things a part of my life
And I want to see that things are going to be right
But if you can't even stand on your feet
And if you don't own the air that you breathe
Then it's not for me to say
But I wouldn't live that way
And I wouldn't stand apart
And I wouldn't find the real
And I wouldn't play a part
And I wouldn't find in love
So misguided by some fool
And just what I'm trying trying to say
Makes my head spin round the room
And I want to make things a part of my life
And I want to see that things are going to be right
But if you can't even stand on your feet
And if you don't own the air that you breathe
Then it's not for me to say
But I wouldn't live that way
And I wouldn't stand apart
And I wouldn't find the real
And I wouldn't play a part
And I wouldn't find in love
So misguided by some fool
And just what I'm trying trying to say
Makes my head spin round the roomEmbed
