I Call Your Name LyricsI call your name
But you're not there
Was I to blame
For being unfair?
Don't you know I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone?
I never weep at night
I can't go on
Don't you know I can't take it?
I don't know who can
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not that kind of man
Don't you know I can't sleep at night?
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
"John... John..."
Don't you know I can't take it?
I don't know who can
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not that kind of man
Don't you know I can't sleep at night?
But just the same, yeah
I never weep at night
I call your name (I call your name)
I never weep at night
I call your name, yeahEmbed
