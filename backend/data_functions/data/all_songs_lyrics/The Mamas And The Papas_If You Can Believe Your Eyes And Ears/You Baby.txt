You Baby LyricsFrom the time I fall asleep till the morning comes I dream about you baby
And I feel alright, 'cause I know tonight I'll be with you baby
And who makes me feel like smiling when the weary day is through
(Who?) You baby, you. (I'm talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
(Who?) You baby, you. (Baby, yeah)
No one but you, you baby--nobody but you
They say candy is sweet, but it just can't compete with you, baby
You've got everything I need and nobody can please like you, you baby
And who believes that my wildest dreams and my craziest schemes will come true
(Who?) You baby, you! (I'm talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
(Who?) You baby, you! (Baby, yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
A little ray of sunshine, a little bit of soul
Add just a touch of magic, it's the greatest thing since rock n' roll
Yeah, baby
(You) You baby, you! (I'm talking about my baby yeah)
No one but you, you baby---nobody but you
(You) You baby, you
No one but you, you baby---nobody but youEmbed
