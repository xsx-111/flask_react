Hey Girl LyricsHey, girl, I know he's put you down
For every new love that he has found
Hey, girl, I know you're feelin' sad
Sad and blue
And you think the trouble's not in him;
The trouble's in you. (No!)
I know he's only tryin' to score
I've seen him, I've seen him breakin' hearts before
Don't try to put him down
(Don't let him get you down.)
He's the boy I want around
(He's not the only boy around)
And you—you shouldn't be so blue
I know there'll be another time
But I'll be his
(No, you'll be mine.)
Hey, girl, although you're feelin' sad
(I'm sad! I'm...)
Sad and blue!
Just remember while you're feelin' bad
I'm waiting for you, yeah
Don't try to put him down!
(Don't let him get you down)
He's the boy I want around and you
(You know I'll always be around.)
And you—you shouldn't be so blueEmbed
