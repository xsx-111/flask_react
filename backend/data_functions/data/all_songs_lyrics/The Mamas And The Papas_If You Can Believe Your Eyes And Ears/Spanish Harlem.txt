Spanish Harlem LyricsAh, ooooooooooooooh
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
Ah, ooooooooooooooh
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
It is a special one; it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
It's growing in the street right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreamy
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
(there is a rose in Spanish Harlem)
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
(a red rose up in Spanish Harlem)
With eyes as black as coal, that look down in my soul
(Ooooooooooooooh)
And start a fire there and then I lose control;
I have to beg your pardon
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
I'm gonna pick that rose and watch her as she grows
In my garden
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
It is a special one; it's never seen the sun
It only comes out when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
I'm gonna pick that rose and watch her as she grows
In my garden
( La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. )
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
(there is a rose in Spanish Harlem)
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
(a red rose up in Spanish Harlem)
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
(there is a rose in Spanish Harlem)Embed
