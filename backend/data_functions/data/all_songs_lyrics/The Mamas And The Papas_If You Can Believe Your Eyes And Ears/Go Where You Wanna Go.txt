Go Where You Wanna Go LyricsYou gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with
You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with
You don't understand
That a girl like me can love just one man
Three thousand miles, that's how far you'll go
And you said to me
"Please don't follow"
You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with
You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with
You don't understand
That a girl like me can love just one man
You've been gone a week and I tried so hard
Not to be the cryin' kind
Not to be the girl you left behind
You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with
You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with
You gotta go where you wanna go
Do what you wanna do
With whoever you wanna do it with1Embed
