Straight Shooter Lyrics
Don't get me mad
Don't tell no lie
Don't make me sad
Don't pass me by
Baby, are you holding
Holding anything but me?
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
If you know what I mean

You can bring me love
You can hang around
You can bring me up
Don't you bring me down
Baby, are you holding
Holding anything but me?
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
If you know what I mean

I've been searching all night
Just to find what I'm looking for
Baby, baby, treat me right
Or I won't come 'round your door
No more
You can bring me love
You can hang around
You can bring me up
Don't you bring me down
Baby, are you holding
Holding anything but me?
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
If you know what I mean

I've been searching all night
Just to find what I'm looking for
(Looking for, looking for)
Baby, baby, treat me right
Or I won't come 'round your door
No more

Don't get me mad
Don't tell no lie
Don't get me sad
Just get me high
Baby, what you're holding
Half of that belongs to me
'Cause I'm a real straight shooter
(Baby, don't you get me mad)
I'm a real straight shooter
(I've been searching all night long)
I'm a real straight shooter
Baby, if you know what I mean
If you know what I mean, oohEmbed
