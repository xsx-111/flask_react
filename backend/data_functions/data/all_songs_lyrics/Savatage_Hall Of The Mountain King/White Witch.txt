White Witch LyricsHeart beat is rapid
Your blood pumping faster
Hands reach for the blade
Touch her
Feel her
Your body it craves her
She leads you to your grave
She's an image all dressed all in white
No, you know you want her now
Casting a spell
Her power on you
You'd leave but you don't know how
White Witch White Witch
Poisoning you
White Witch White Witch
Coming for you
White Witch White Witch
Taking your souls
White Witch White Witch
Taking control
Wrapped and enraging
I use to maintain it
Do you want some more?
Give her your money
Sell her your soul
The deadliest of whores
Wicked white demon
Is staring at you
Controlling all that you say and you do
Sweating intensely
The music's much loader
On the glass is a poison powder
White Witch White Witch
Poisoning you
White Witch White Witch
Coming for you
White Witch White Witch
Taking your souls
White Witch White Witch
Taking control
White Witch White Witch
Poisoning you
White Witch White Witch
Coming for you
White Witch White Witch
Taking your souls
White Witch White Witch
Taking control
She is now your only master
Your whole life's a complete disaster
Don't you dare
Let her in
As your final chore
White Witch White Witch
Poisoning you
White Witch White Witch
Coming for you
White Witch White Witch
Taking your souls
White Witch White Witch
Taking control
Taking my soul
Taking controlEmbed
