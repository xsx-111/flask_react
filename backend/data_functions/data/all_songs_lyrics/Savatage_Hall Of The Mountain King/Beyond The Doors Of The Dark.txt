Beyond The Doors Of The Dark LyricsListen to me children of the night
Beyond the doors of darkness you will find
A thousand worlds for you to see here
Take my hand and follow me, oh
Beyond the doors of the dark
Demon in your heart
Scream and thrash your head
Turn around now you're dead
Under the darkened haze
Lost here in glaze
Are you looking to be free
A never ending suicide
Of nightmares you have inside
Another day's begun
Under the moon and sun
Circle has been drawn
Life has been prolonged
Hell is eternity
Hell is your destiny
I'll tell you to die
A never ending suicide
Of nightmares you have inside
Oh, beyond the doors of the dark yeah
Beyond the doors of the dark
Oh yeah
It's time to meet your fate
Heaven can wait
All the walls are closing in
Things crawl on your skin
He's grabbing down at you
There's nothing you can do
No place to run and hide
A never ending suicide
Of nightmares you have inside
He wants to take your soul
You know you're dreaming
Call your precious little life under my knife
Hell is eternity
Hell is your destiny
I'll tell you to die
Never ending suicide
Of nightmares you have inside
Beyond the doors of the dark
Beyond the doors of the dark
Oh yeah
Beyond the doors of the dark
Beyond the doors of the dark
Oh yeah
