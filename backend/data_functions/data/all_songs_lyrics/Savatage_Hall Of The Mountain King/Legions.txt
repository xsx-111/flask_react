Legions LyricsA call from the night
Metal storming masses
In the lies
Battle cry
Screaming to the night
Oh no
Summon up the legions
To do our deeds
Our legion's needs
Are growing every day
We're coming out tonight
We come from the darker light
Join your hands and pray
Maybe you can all be saved
Legions of the night
Legions of the night
Good god
Legions of the night
Can they hear your battle cry
Cry out
But what does it matter?
There's no way to escape
The hold we have on you
Ohh ho
Controlled by the master
Infiltrate
Penetrate
Your little precious minds
We're coming out tonight
We come from the darker light
Join your hands and pray
Maybe you can all be saved
Legions of the night
Legions of the night
Good god
Legions of the night
Can they hear your battle cry
Scream loud
Let the masses hear you
Banging hard across the ground
Shatter the darkest lights
Oh no
Heed the master's calling
Congregate
Celebrate
The power you've obtained
Good god
Legions of the night
Legions of the night
Good god
Can I hear your battle cry, yeahEmbed
