24 Hrs. Ago LyricsBehind the wheel just went along
I'm tired of hearing the same old song
Look
I rule the night
No end in sight
I think I'm going insane, oh yeah
Engines grind
I hit the red line
I'm movin' fast
Forget the past
I'm burning tread
In my head
I am gone
Twenty four hours ago
Yeah
Got to escape
Can't take any more
I grabbed my suitcase
And kicked down the door
Yeah
I've got blood shot eyes
Hypnotized
I feel no pain
Oh yeah
Engines grind
I hit the red line
I'm movin' fast
Forget the past
I'm burning tread
In my head
I am gone
Twenty four hours ago
Yeah
Engines grind
I hit the red line
I'm movin' fast
Forget the past
I'm burning tread
In my head
I am gone
Twenty four hours ago
Yeah
Twenty four hours ago
YeahEmbed
