Devastation LyricsWaiting for disaster
Blackness in the night
I roam the world
To hear the cry
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
2000 brings
The untimely end
Of all living things
The Four Horsemen have started their ride
Can you see them in the sky
Glaring down at the ground
Smile on their face
As they commence
The end of the human race
Total devastation
Prepare yourself for death
This world's insane
Start your fields afire
Watching them burn
Tomorrow will be
Another world's turn
To win is the end
To be a part of judgment day
We should have listened
To what Christ had to say
Total devastation
Prepare yourself for death
This world's insane
What do you say
We all have our chances of living in peace
Now I'm afraid you're in too deep
What can you do when you're a fool
It all goes this way
You should have listened
To what Christ had to say
Total devastation
Prepare yourself to die
This world's insane
No no no no
This world's insane
Oh yeah
No no no no
Stop itEmbed
