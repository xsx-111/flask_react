Hall Of The Mountain King LyricsFar away
In a land caught between time and space
Where the books of life lay
Within this castle of stone
The mountain king roams
All alone in here
But he's not the only one
Lost inside
Forever hidden from the sun
Madness reigns
In the hall of the mountain king
Oh yeah
His deep
Dark eyes keep watch on his kingdom
And mysteries that sleep safe inside
His hall
His towers of stone
Shall not be overthrown
For eternity
It is guarded by the king
Insanity and the power that it brings
Madness reigns
In the hall of the mountain king
Oh yeah
Come with me
Stay close by my side
As the darkness of night closes in
Don't fear
In the thunder, it roars
When the mountain king calls all his children home
To where I hid him we must run
Refuge here
But I was forever on the run
Madness reigns, my friends...
In the hall of the mountain king
Oh yeah
In the hall of the mountain kingEmbed
