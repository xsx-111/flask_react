The Price You Pay LyricsI know you're all alone tonight
And I hear your cries
From the world that lies
Beyond these lives
You've got dreams inside
They cut
I know
Cut so deep but you never show
That's the price you pay
That's the price you pay
Is your soul on the line my dear
As you take your bows
To a silent crowd
That never hears
Close your eyes for now
And leave your rage
Take my hand and walk the stage
That's the price you pay
That's the price you pay
That's the price you pay
That's the price you pay
There's no need to worry
Cause you have tomorrows
Another phase of life has begun
Am I getting through to you?
Can your mind reach beyond tonight
I believe your love for life
Will never die
So my child you ask
What does this mean
Cut the chains and chase the dream
That's the price you pay
That's the price you pay
That's the price you pay
That's the price you pay
Ooh yeah
That's the price you pay
When you come here to playEmbed
