Albatross Lyrics
You got an albatross around your neck
Around your neck
You got a hundred broken lightbulbs above your head
They said that you had it coming but I wouldn't bet
Cause you got a slowly ticking time bomb and then you see red

Sunblind
Sunblind

You got an albatross around your neck
Around your neck
You got a pile of broken wishbones under your bed
And you got a hungry green eyed monster that you keep fed
And it keeps on coming over it wants you dead

Sunblind
Sunblind

You burnt the lungs
That your ancestors created
You sat by the banks
Of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back
And the water had abated
You drank your share
But you still could not be sated
Quicksands of the mind
And the sinkholes you may find
When you look through
The twisting of the vines
(The twisting of the vines)
Time comes round again
It's etching at your bones
Chill wind comes round
It's blowing through your home
Quicksands of the mind
And the sinkholes you may find
When you look through
The twisting of the vines

You burnt the lungs
That your ancestors created
You sat by the banks
Of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back
And the water had abated
You drank your share
But you still could not be sated
You said you're scared
Of the clocks that keep ticking over
We'll find a way
For a life that's worth living over
Again and again
For a life that's worth living over
Again and again
For a life that's worth living over
Again and again
Again and again and again
Again again
Again and again and again7Embed
