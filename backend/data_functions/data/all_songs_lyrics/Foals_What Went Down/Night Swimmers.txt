Night Swimmers Lyrics
Another hot summerâ€™s day
And only we know the way
To the cool blue lagoon
Where we sleep until noon

The city is all ablaze
With blue notes and haze
We hit the open wide roads
Snuck the moon in clothes

Get up again
Get up again
Get up again

We swim under the moon
In the cool blue lagoon
You count up all my scars
Crumble them into stars
You're such a perfect mess
You in your dirty white dress
And the day I came to
Get up again
Get up again
Get up again

The perfect blue evening
We sit and drink and we sing
Smoke flowers rising high
Under the flaming sky4Embed
