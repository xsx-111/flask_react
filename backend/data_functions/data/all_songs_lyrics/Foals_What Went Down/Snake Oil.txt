Snake Oil LyricsOh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Yay, you keep it slow
Yay-yay, you keep it low

You sell snake oil to the butcher
The butcher's bill must always be paid
It's a wild wait to wait and it leads to no surprises
No surprise, no-one gets laid
You put the snake oil under my tongue
Show me the door, the way to be free
Cause you know the moves that only you do
Makes fools of a boy like me
Ooooh
Ooooh
Yay, uh

You sell snake oil to the sinners
When all they crave is just to be free
Its a wild tease, tease me with nothing better
Nothing better, slower than me
You cast a spell that keeps me wired
Keeps me red, keeps me on fire
So why do you take me down, down to nothing
Always out cold, never been higher
Ooooh
Ooooh

In the day
You leave me to want what I crave
No surprise, to want what I can't find
You said it again
Again, again
Come on, you said
You said it again

Driving through the old county line
Where I go to find what is mine
Driving past the old county line
Where I go to find what is mine
Ooooh
Ooooh
You said it again
You give it away

In the day
You leave me to want what I crave
No surprise, to want what I can't findEmbed
