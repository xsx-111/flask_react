London Thunder Lyrics
I'm on the red eye flight to nowhere good
How 'bout you?
I've been in the air for hours
Meteor showers by the pool
So one last drink for summer
I'm always leaving, never you
Come back to London thunder
The sound has sorrowed in my room
Ye-yeah

And now the table's turned,  it's over
And with my fingers burned, I start anew
And now I've come back down, I'm older
I look for something else to hold on to

There's no way to realign
Upholstered skin, I take back every line
Lost my mind in San Francisco
Worn out disco when tempers cooled
There's no water
There is no sound
Will you come around?
Will you come around?
There is no space
There is no time
Where to draw the line?
And now the table's turned,  it's over
And with my fingers burned, I start anew
And now I've come back down, I'm older
I look for something else to hold on to

I'm on the red eye flight to nowhere good
How 'bout you?12Embed
