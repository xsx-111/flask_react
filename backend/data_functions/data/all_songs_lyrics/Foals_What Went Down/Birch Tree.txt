Birch Tree Lyrics
The city I was born in
I left a long time ago
And we lost touch
Grew apart my friend
My heart's an old pole dancer
Troubled romancer, you know
It's a subway chancer
A question with no answer

Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows

And when we age
Shed our skin and grow
We shed our layers
Spread our wings and go
My heart's an old black panther
Corrupted financer, you know
It's a troubled romancer
A question with no answer
Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows

Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows

Ooooh, oooooh
(Yeah) Ooooh
(Yeah) Ooooh

Oh now the river runs away but I chase it (yeah)
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it (yeah)
Oh now the river runs away when I chase it (yeah)
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it (yeah)

Come meet me by the river
See how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river
See how time it flows
Oh now the river runs away but I chase it
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it
Oh now the river runs away when I chase it
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it4Embed
