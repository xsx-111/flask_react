Lonely Hunter Lyrics
It's a new day
Just in time for me to say "I'm sorry"
For all the things I said but didn't mean
It's a new time
So why must I wait in line for what's mine?
It's a new day
Why must it be the same?

Been gone too long, so don't wait up
It's 3 AM, I got held up
Tried to call, I'm on my way

Will I see you? I got lost in foreign lands
Tried to get back, oh, I hoped you understand
Just remember, that love is a gun in your hand

It's a new year
Just in time for me to say "I'd be there"
But didn't make the grade
It's a new time
So why must I wait in line for what's mine?
It's a new day
Always feels the same
Been gone too long, so don't wait up
It's 3 AM, I got held up
Tried to call, I'm on my way

Will I see you? I got lost in foreign lands
Tried to get back, oh, I hoped you understand
Wait forever
For love is a gun in your hand
In the deep blue, I'm a hundred miles away
Treading water, It's too deep for me to stay
Just remember, love is the gun in your hand

Just in time for me to say "I'm sorry"
Why must I wait in line for what's mine?

In the deep blue, see the whitecaps from the shore
But I can't swim, and it keeps me wanting more
Just remember, love is a gun in your hand
Will I see you?
I got lost in foreign lands
Tried to make it back, oh, I hoped you understand
Wait forever, for love is a gun in your hand9Embed
