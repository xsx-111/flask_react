Torn Lyrics
I learned how to fall today
Didn’t think it would kill you
To settle a debt I thought
Never would be paid
Found out I was wrong today
Too weak to continue
One final defense to fall
Still unbroken

Now I am torn
Thought it was over this time
And we know
There’s still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away

Knew there was a price to pay
Didn’t think it would thrill you
To witness the fallen one
Shattered and ashamed
No, I'm not the only one
Yearning to fulfill you
Unwilling to risk all
Still uncertain
Now I am torn
Thought it was over this time
And we know
There’s still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away

Now I am torn
Thought it was over this time
And we know
There’s still a fire inside
And we know, and we know

That I am torn (Torn)
Thought it was over this time
And we know (Know)
There’s still a fire inside
And we know, and we know
We're gonna let it burn
Let it burn
Till the image fades away1Embed
