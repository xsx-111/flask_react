Stupify (Live at the Riviera) LyricsYeah, bringing you another disturbing creation
From the mind of one sick animal
Who can't tell the difference
And gets stupified
I've been waiting my whole life for just one fuck!
And all I needed was just one fuck!
Well, can you see that you don't give a fuck!
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All I wanted was just one fuck!
One tiny, little innocent fuck!
And when I feel like I'm straight out of luck!
I find my stupified, coming back again
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping away
See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified
It's all the same, you say
Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified
I get stupified
All the people in the left wing rock!
And all the people in the right wing rock!
And all the people in the underground rock!
I find myself stupified, coming back again
All the people in the high-rise fuck!
And all the people in the projects fuck!
And all la gente in the barrio fuck!
I find myself stupified, coming back again
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality?
I can feel it all start slipping
I think I'm breaking down
Why do you like playing around with
My narrow scope of reality
I can feel it all start slipping away
See, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified
It's all the same, you say
Live with it, but I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified
I get stupified
Tefached
Tefached
And don't deny me
No, baby, now, don't deny me
And, darlin', don't be afraid
But I don't get it
Don't you think maybe we could put it on credit?
Don't you think it can take control when I don't let it?
I get stupified
Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, stare in my soul
I begin to stupify
Look in my face, stare in my soul
Look in my face, stare in my soul
Look in my face, stare in my soul
Look in my face, stare in my soul
Look in my face
Look in my face
Look in my face
I begin to stupifyEmbed
