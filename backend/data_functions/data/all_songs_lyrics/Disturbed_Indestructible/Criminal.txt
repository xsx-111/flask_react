Criminal Lyrics
Malevolent criminal, I
When the vision paints my mind
Cross the invisible line
And you'll be paid in kind
Malevolent criminal, I
When the vision paints my mind
Cross the invisible line
And you'll be paid in kind

Hit it!

Criminal, this suffering
It makes me think like a criminal
The suffering, when we’re alone
Criminal, this suffering
It makes me feel like a criminal
The suffering, when we’re alone

Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To bury my vision?
The hunger coming over me
As I learn to hide the agony
To make a final remedy
To close that door once and for all
In a world that I don’t want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don’t tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

It seems the whole experience is
Terrible and crippling
The pain is much more than physical
Beyond belief, when we’re alone

Typical enough for me
That I burn inside in agony
What power will enable me
To make this decision?
Despair has fallen over me
No way to hide the agony
Embracing my calamity
To save myself once and for all
In a world that I don’t want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don’t tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me “motherfucker”
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to call me “motherfucker”
Now you want to know
You want a name
You want to say it doesn't matter now

Now, now you want to know
Now you want a name
Now you want a place
Now you want a time
Now you want it all
Now you want to know
Now you want a name
Now you want a place
Now you want a time
Now you want it all, now!
In a world that I don’t want to know
With a message that I never want to send
To be freed from all of this
I want you to quicken my end
Don’t tell me I cannot go
With a wound that refuses to mend
Deliver me from all of this
I want you to quicken my end

Don’t say that it isn’t so
I’m on a path that you’ll never comprehend
Set me free me from all of this
I need you to quicken my end2Embed
