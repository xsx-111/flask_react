The Night Lyrics
What has come over me?
What madness taken hold of my heart
To run away, the only answer
Pulling me away to fall upon (the night)
The source of my recovery
Sweet shadow taking hold of the light
Another day has been devoured
Calling me away, bringing a question: Why?

For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

Now, on a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night
This self-discovery
Redemption taking hold of my mind
A serenade of haunting voices
Calling me away to feast upon (the night)
The source of my felicity
Dark maiden taking hold of my hand
Lead me away, from hibernation
Strong and unafraid, never a question why

For saving me from all they’ve taken
Let my honor fall again
Giving me the strength to face them
Feeling it taking over

Now, on a path to take it all away
There can be no better way of knowing
In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night
Give into the night

In a world beyond controlling
Are you gonna deny the savior
In front of your eyes?
Stare into the night!
Power beyond containing
Are you gonna remain a slave
For the rest of your life?
Give into the night

Night, night, night
Give into the night
Night, night, night
Give into the night
Give into the night5Embed
