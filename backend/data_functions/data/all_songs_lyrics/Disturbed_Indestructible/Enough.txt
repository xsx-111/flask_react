Enough Lyrics
We don't want them
We want everything
And we've told them
To want everything

We don't want them
We want everything
And we've stolen, in this suffering
And we've told them
To want everything
But use caution in what you believe
And the haunted
Deny everything
Controlling in this suffering
When they're broken
And lost everything
They’re so much easier to lead

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside
When your own have died
When there’s no more pride
When your soul is frozen, is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment, is that enough?

Without warning
We take everything
Without warning
We take everything
Undaunted in this suffering
The dark forces
Surround everything
And make it impossible to see

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Leave them nothing left inside

When your own have died
When there’s no more pride
When your soul is frozen, is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment, is that enough?
Haven’t they suffered enough now?
Haven’t we suffered enough now?
Haven’t they suffered enough
The damage more than they can bare
Haven’t they suffered enough now?
Haven’t we suffered enough now?
Haven’t they suffered enough
The damage more than I can bare

Did they even have a reason why?
Countless sons and daughters had to die
Can you even comprehend the pain?
Tell me when your

Own have died
When there’s no more pride
When your soul is frozen, is that enough?
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment, is that enough?

When your own have died (Own have died)
When there’s no more pride (No more pride)
When your soul is frozen, is that enough? (Is that enough?)
When your heart is broken
A thousand times (A thousand times)
With every moment, is that enough?Embed
