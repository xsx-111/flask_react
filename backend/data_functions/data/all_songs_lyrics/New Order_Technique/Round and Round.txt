Round and Round Lyrics
I just can't help thinking
What you've done to me (done to me, done to me, done to me)
You built a wall of love
And tore it right down in front of me
And you think you know
What's going on
You keep telling me that I am wrong
I don't care about
What you do
'Cause if you mess with me
I'll get rid of you

The picture you see
Is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown
To someone I don't know
And it's driving me wild
It makes me act like a child

You think I am crazy
But what can I do? (I do, I do, I do)
You waste your time, like my money
It ain't so funny, but it's true
(Don't waste my money, baby)
Now, you can't tell me
What's going on
And that I am weak
While you are strong
What is it you need
That makes your heart bleed?
Do you really know?
'Cause it doesn't show
The picture you see
Is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown
To someone I don't know
And it's driving me wild
It makes me act like a child


The picture you see
Is no portrait of me
It's too real to be shown
To someone I don't know
And it's driving me wild
It makes me act like a child1Embed
