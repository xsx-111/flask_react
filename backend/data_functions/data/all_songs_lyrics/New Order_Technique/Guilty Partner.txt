Guilty Partner Lyrics
Listen to me, I know what I'm saying
But Lord, it don't come easy
To admit that I was wrong
It took me far too long
I counted on you
To give me a reason
Why the sun don't shine in the season
Grey sky surrounded me

I'm not some kind of foolish lover
I couldn't take this from no other
You're not being cool with me
'Cause I always know you'll come back to me
Yes, you'll come back to me
'Cause I always know what it takes to make you my lover

You once said to me that I was a cruel man
And you know, I almost believed you
I was blind and I couldn't see
You took my sight from me
And all of these words
And all this emotion
Can't explain my hopeless devotion
Or change what had to be
I'm not some kind of foolish lover
I couldn't take this from no other
You're not being cool with me
'Cause I always know you'll come back to me
Yes, you'll come back to me
Yes, you'll come back to me


I'm not some kind of foolish lover
I couldn't take this from no other
You're not being cool with me
'Cause I always know you'll come back to me
Yes, you'll come back to me


I'm not some kind of foolish lover
I couldn't take this from another
It's no good being cool with me
'Cause I always know what it takes to make you my lover1Embed
