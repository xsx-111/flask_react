Fine Time LyricsYou're much too young
To be a part of me
Too young
To get a hold on me
You're much too young
You're much too young
You're much too young
To mess around with me
Hey, you know I've met a lot of cool chicks
But I've never met a girl with all her own teeth
That's why I love you, babe
And that's why we could be
But you're too young
Too young for me
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
The past doesn't matter
Hey hey, sophisticated lady
You know I've met a lot of cool chicks
But you've got style
And you've got class
But most of all
You've got love technique1Embed
