Lights & Music Lyrics
This is why we won't delay for your birthday
The secrets that we held that day will be kept straight
All your friends have gone away, so let's celebrate
You're holding hope open for the one making you wait

Tell me what you hoped to say on your birthday
The secrets that we held that day will be kept straight
Everyone will be dismayed if your promise breaks
But you'll be back again to say who you want next

Lights and music are on my mind
Be my baby one more time
Lights and music are on my mind
Be my baby one more time

Fading with the colour you see in my face
Cold and crystal you can't hide, as your tears race
I'll be waiting by in time, but your dream's away
You're holding hope open for the one making you wait

Lights and music are on my mind
Be my baby one more time
Lights and music are on my mind
Be my baby one more time5Embed
