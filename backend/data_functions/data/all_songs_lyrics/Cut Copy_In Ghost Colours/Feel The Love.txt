Feel The Love Lyrics
All the girls I've known are crying
All the clouds have silver linings
Though the days are counting backwards
I know that you have the right words

Me and you
Over something to do
Could this be true
It all comes down to you

Hey you, hey you
All the girls I've known are crying
All the clouds have silver linings


Hey you, hey you
Hey you, hey youEmbed
