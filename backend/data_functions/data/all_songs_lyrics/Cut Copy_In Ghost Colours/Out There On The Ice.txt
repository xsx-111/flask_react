Out There On The Ice Lyrics
Yes, no, maybe
Is all I need to hear from you
As things go crazy
She's lost herself and lost to you
And now that nothing's spoken
She's out there on the ice again
She's breaking down slowly
Colliding as she holds your hand

You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know who'll be there for you
You don't know what to do
There's a guy you know who'll be there for you

Yes, no, maybe
Is all I need to hear from you
As things go crazy
She's lost herself and lost to you
And now that nothing's spoken
She's out there on the ice again
She'll take me down slowly
She's holding on to what she can

If that's what it takes
Then don't let it tear us apart
Even if it breaks your heart
If that's what it takes
Then don't let it tear us apart
Even if it breaks your heart
Even if it breaks your heart
Even if it breaks your heartEmbed
