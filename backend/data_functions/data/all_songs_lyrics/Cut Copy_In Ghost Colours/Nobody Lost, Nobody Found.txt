Nobody Lost, Nobody Found Lyrics
Always crashing to the ground
Always from the same height
Always falling down
If you start a fashion now
Make me a believer
The seas will part somehow
Staring at a silver sun
I'm blinded, I can see you almost in my town
Nothing but a sea of blue
Separating seasons
And I think of you

Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love

Walking through a paper town
Counting all the reasons to burn the others down
Seems like every chance I take
Brings me ever closer to being far away
Black out, keep your colors dim
So nobody can see you
And let the ghost back in
Leave me heading to the ground
Always from the same height
And always falling down
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of love
Burning in the face of loveEmbed
