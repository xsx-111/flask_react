Unforgettable Season Lyrics
This is what I thought you said
Talking on the phone
Just walk away and cry
Cause so long
The holidays we spent will fade
Now that I've been gone
Just remember that we met
You're still at home

Listen to the voice that says al-alright
This is start and not the end tonight

You sent an SOS away
Reach across the sky
Through glowing windows we stare
But not at home
Times like this you wonder why
It's even worth your while
Just count the silence these days
Until you smile
