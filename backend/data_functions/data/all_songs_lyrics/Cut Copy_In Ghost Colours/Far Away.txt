Far Away Lyrics
One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go
And if you will stay here with me
Then we will always know

We will find out
As we change about
Is this the last part?
Here is when we shout

One thing that I just can't conceive
Is how to let you go
These days await if we believe
I'll make it to the show


And you could say, "Your love to me,"
But I was far away
And you could be a love to me
But I was far away
And you could say "Your love to me"
That I was far away
And you could be a love to me
But I was far away
I've lost myself once and I see
That I was weak at heart
And if you will stay here with me
We face the hardest part



If you believe a hand on your sleeve
Can pull you over
Because you know wherever you go
I'll be over your shoulder
If you believe a hand on your faith
Can pull you over
Because you know wherever you go
I'll be over your shoulder

And you could say, "Your love to me,"
But I was far away
And you could be a love to me
But I was far awayEmbed
