So Haunted Lyrics
What's that you see?
There's all these satellites, satellites, satellites
Orbiting you and me
Just one glimpse can change your life, change your life, change your life
And you can see
Through all these satellites, satellites, satellites
Orbiting you and me
One glimpse change your life, change your life, change your life, change it

I get so haunted, I fall in your dreams tonight
I get so haunted that I'm misunderstood tonight

What's that you see?
There's all the satellites, satellites, satellites
Haunting you and me
Just one glimpse can change your life, change your life, change your life
And you can see
Through all these satellites, satellites, satellites
Haunting you and me
One glimpse change your life, change your life, change your life, change it

This is real, this is what you search out
And you wouldn't believe, you could never say it's true
You can leave, and you could go out, search out
Harbor daze, harbor daze
In a harbor daze
In a harbor dazeEmbed
