Cold Youth LyricsIt's a strange love
That i've been feeling
When I was sixteen
Oh liquid ???
In a jumpsuit
In a comic book
Whispear in the truth
Oh it's a cold youth
And it's a strange love
That i've been feeling
When I was sixteen
Oh liquid ????
In a jumpsuit
In a comic book
Whispearing the truth
Oh it's a cold youth
Hey, hey, we're trying to go away, hey
We're trying to go away, hey, we're trying to go away, hey, we're trying to go away
(In the cold, in the cold, in the cold...)
It's a strange love
That i've been feeling
When I was sixteen
Oh liquid ????
In a jumpsuit
In a comic book
Whispear in the truth
Oh it's the cold youth
Hey, hey, we're trying to go away, hey
We're trying to go away, hey, we're trying to go away, hey, we're trying to go away, hey, we're trying to go away, hey, we're trying to go away, hey, we're trying to go away, hey, we're trying to go away
(Hey! You say, it's time to go away. Hey! You say, it's time to go away. Hey! You say, it's time to go away. Hey! You say it's time to go away.)Embed
