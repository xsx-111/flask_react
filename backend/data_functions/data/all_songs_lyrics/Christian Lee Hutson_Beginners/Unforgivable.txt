Unforgivable Lyrics
The fall was pretty nasty
On that, we can agree
But they're never really clean
Sometimes neither is the break
And by the time I left you
The room looked like a bruise
A curtain breach let pink and blue
Light wash across your face, but

Is it so unforgivable
To wander off the course?
We had a pretty good run
But I just can't fucking do it anymore

I was eager to commit once
Not for forever
'Cause if you remember that I never once said
You should never say, "Never"
'Cause that's gravity for you
When you're stuck up and stupid
It turns you into a student
For thinking you were so clever, but
Is it so unforgivable
To wander off the course?
We had a pretty good run
But I just can't fucking do it anymore

And I'm not afraid to call it
The way that it is
Looks like you wasted a wish on some supposed second wind
And I don't care who sees me
Behaving so ugly
I just hate that you loved me
And that this is how it ends, but

Is it so unforgivable
To wander off the course?
We had a pretty good run
But I just can't fucking do it anymore1Embed
