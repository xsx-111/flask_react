Northsiders Lyrics
I was new in town, kinda goth
I met you in the science quad
You asked if I had any pot
We're going up to Mikey's spot
Covering important ground
I tried cocaine in my cousin's house
Yeah, I'm probably addicted now
The things that children lie about
I didn't notice it was getting late
You offered me a place to stay
We live up in the palisades
Tell your folks you ran away
Besides, you're a Northsider now

Nothing's going to change it, pal

We were so pretentious then
Didn't trust the government
Said that we were communists
And thought that we invented it
Morrissey apologists
Amateur psychologists
Serial monogamists
We went to different colleges
But you said that we would always be
Branches on the same old tree
Reaching away from each other for eternity
And you know I can't argue with that
Nothing's going to change it now

We could have had one last hurrah
When I was working in the smoothie shop
But I couldn't get the weekend off
She told me I was getting soft
I read an article about the accident
Probably reaching for cigarettes
And missed the brake lights up ahead
I hope it was an instant death
Sometimes I imagine us way down the line
Getting fat somewhere in the countryside
It's crazy how things shake out sometimes
But maybe that's enough magic for me

Nothing's going to change it now2Embed
