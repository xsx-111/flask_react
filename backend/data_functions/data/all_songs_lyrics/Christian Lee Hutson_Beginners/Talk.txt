Talk Lyrics
Someday I'll fix my shoes
For somebody else to use
When I can touch their face
And stay in the same place
But I'm terrified I won't
I was raised over the phone
Your word was a wave then
Endlessly breaking

I'm a chip off the old block
'Cause I'm all talk

I'm pretty busy
So please forgive me
If I forget to
Not forgive you
The way that I see it
You're no longer needed
And if I'm not mistaken
Your ship never came in, did it?

I'm a chip off the old block
'Cause I'm all talk
But I will no longer grieve for you
When I have to see you
It's no use denyin'
You belong to the dyin'
And I couldn't care less
Life's just a real slow death
Yep, that's what I was taught
Okay, so I care a lot

I'm a chip off the old block
'Cause I'm all talk
I'm a chip off the old block
'Cause I'm all talk
'Cause I'm all talk
'Cause I'm all talk1Embed
