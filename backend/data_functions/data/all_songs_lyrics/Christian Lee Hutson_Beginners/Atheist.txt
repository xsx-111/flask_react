Atheist Lyrics
On our initial descent into Chicago
Katie leans over my lap
Looking out the window
For a glimpse of the house we were kids in
She says, “I hated it then, but now I kind of miss it” (Mm, mm)
Shirts in the microwave, trash in the sink
Quarters in a mason jar for every time she smokes
She says, “If we keep this up, girls, in no time we’ll be broke”

I don’t remember getting older, but I’m slowing down
I don’t know if I’m gonna miss you where I’m going now

The 20th of October
Hair of the dog, a blanket on your shoulder
Reading the menu in an accent
Trying to get you laughing
She said some kids from the Christian school
Came to sing her a song
It went like, “Angels watching over us all our little lives”
I don’t know if I buy it, but it does sound kinda nice

I don’t remember getting older, but I’m slowing down
I don’t know if I’m gonna miss you where I’m going now
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mmEmbed
