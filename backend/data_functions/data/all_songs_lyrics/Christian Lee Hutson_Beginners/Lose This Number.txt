Lose This Number Lyrics
Bobby helped me track you down 'cause
I just saw your name in the paper
You said, "Of course that reminded you of me
Don't you know that's how a name works?
I know you don't have to forgive me
Hell, you probably shouldn't
I got scared and I took off
I wanted to try but I couldn't"

That night you shook me, but I wasn't sleeping
You were afraid of the thunder
Asked me to come in the bedroom
Pulled me under the covers

Lose this number
Lose this number

It's like I was born on the back of a bullet
With your name written on it
This city will probably kill me
It's the only thing keeping me honest
I want to crawl into this daydream I'm having
And live here forever
Confetti blowing into the ocean
Three of us finally together
Where the whole time I've just been asleep here
Twenty years younger
Smell of sugar and seaweed
Indian summer
