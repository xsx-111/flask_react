Twin Soul Lyrics
Our cheeks were frozen
Watching the storm roll in
We missed the ferry
Got stuck in the city, barely
Covering our heads
With a coat, when you said
We could be more than friends
It’ll never be this good again

I’m gonna hurt you and myself too
'Cause that’s the only thing
That I know how to do

You’ve been away for months
The bands finally breaking up
Charlie’s a fucking tool
Says he’s going back to school
The radio plays tunes
You wrote in your childhood room
I turn it too loud
Pretend you’re here right now

I’m gonna hurt you and myself too
'Cause that’s the only thing
That I know how to do
You told me not to
But whenever you’re gone I do
Let my thoughts go
Hypothetical
You met your twin soul
While you were on the road
Twisted in the sheets
Said it didn’t mean a thing

I’m gonna hurt you and myself too
'Cause that’s the only thing
That I know how to do3Embed
