Keep You Down Lyrics
I could've told you they loved you
From the way they stood still
But I hope you didn't notice
And that you never will
'Cause it isn't hard to imagine
That you won't need me someday
But I know something that you don't
You never did anyway

Our love's already begun to brown
And unless I can convince you
No one could want you now
You're gonna see how easy it is to fool around
So I have to keep you down

At some point you decided
That you were burning through self esteem
Locked up whatever you had left
And trusted me with the keys
'Cause you thought I figured it all out
But that's completely insane
I think you should've considered
No one remembers my name
Our love's already begun to brown
And unless I can convince you
No one could want you now
You're gonna see how easy it is to fool around
So I have to keep you down

Your oversight's gonna cost you
Maybe eventually
See, I've been biddin' against you
Unintentionally

Our love's already begun to brown
And unless I can convince you
No one could want you now
You're gonna see how easy it is to fool around
So I have to keep you down
I have to keep you down1Embed
