Single For The Summer Lyrics
You said that you forgot to put the candles in the cake
It's double digits now, I heard you tell the waitress, "Eight"
You didn't need a ticket then to walk me to the gate
I showed the woman next to me your picture on the plane

Things are gonna turn around any day now
Things are gonna turn around any day now

You made me run from Clover Park
Your dad was still at work
You took my sweaty hands and put them underneath your shirt
Can we be single for the summer?
Drinking 40's on the roof
I told you I was dying then
It was technically the truth

Things are gonna turn around any day now
Things are gonna turn around any day now
Things are gonna turn around any day now
Things are gonna turn around any day now

It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now
It’s gonna happen any day now1Embed
