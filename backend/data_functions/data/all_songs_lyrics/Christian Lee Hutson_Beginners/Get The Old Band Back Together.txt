Get The Old Band Back Together Lyrics
You idiots in your leather jackets and glasses
You know I can still kick all your asses
Harry, I had a thought, if I dust the old axe off
Maybe we could give this thing a real shot

Let's get the old band back together again
Let's get back in the room and let the magic happen
Let's get the old band back together

After the baby, everything changed
I only have a couple a night these days
And I'm glad that I came, I like the new name
But with Anna on bass, it really doesn't feel the same

Let's get the old band back together again
Let's get back in the room and let the magic happen
Let's get the old band back together

Ba-ba-da-da
Ba-ba-da-da
Ba-ba-da-da, da-da-da-da
I've been gigging around, it's really bumming me out
That suddenly no one wants to play it fuckin' loud

Let's get the old band back together again
Let's get back in the room and let the magic happen
Let's get the old band back together
Let's get the old band back together again
Let's get back in the room and let the magic happen
Let's get the old band back together
Let's get the old band back together
Let's get the old band back together

That was pretty good1Embed
