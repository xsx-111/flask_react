Seven Lakes Lyrics
The beds were all made
I slept on the floor
First time in love and she called you a whore
We thought that they might
Try to send you out of state
Nothing could be done then
To keep me away

I hope you catch a break
Oldest daughter
At seven lakes
Treading water

Sealing up the crawlspace
Found your little stash
Won't be like your brother
We're gonna get you back
You tried too hard to convince us you were no longer at risk
The medicine can only help you if you're sick

So you're gonna have to stay
A little longer
At seven lakes
Barely treading water
The birds here sound just like an old arcade game
You ask what I'm up to
More of the same

I'm gonna turn up the page
Build an altar
At seven lakes
