Night Shift Lyrics
The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit
I mistakenly called them by your name
I was let down, it wasn't the same
I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one-track mind
Regaining my self-worth in record time
But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine
Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth?
Call you a bitch and leave?
Why did I come here? To sit and watch you stare at your feet?
What was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?

I feel no need to forgive, but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips, so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark, feeling all hell

Don't hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best
You don't deserve what you don't respect
Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect
Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young
Take back what you said
Can't lose what you never had
I feel no need to forgive, but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips, so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark, feeling all hell

You got a 9-to-5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again, if I can help it
In five years, I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

You got a 9-to-5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again, if I can help it
In five years, I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

You got a 9-to-5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again, if I can help it
In five years, I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers22Embed
