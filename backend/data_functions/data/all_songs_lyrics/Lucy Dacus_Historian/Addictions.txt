Addictions Lyrics
Freeze frame tidal wave in the passenger side
I'm still a nervous kid after all this time
Can you imagine what it's like to be here with you now?
Forget your current lover, remember me that one July
Laying bareback on dirt roads, watching the planes at night
Who knew one day it'd be so hard to have you by my side?

Now I'm awake at 2 AM
Without a cause to draw you in

Buy-low-sell-high kind of guy
Invest your time in what's worthwhile
Was I a risk without reward or did I make you proud?

Now I'm awake at 2 AM
Without a cause to draw you in

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You'll pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've been around the world and back
Always return to the ones you love
You've got a sense of adventure
And a penchant for comfort that keeps you at home

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You'll pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

We're erasing years of senseless waiting
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too2Embed
