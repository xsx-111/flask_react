Next of Kin Lyrics
Reading in the phone booth
Sucking on a ginger root
I never got to talk to you
Why is this the image I come back to?
Pick my jewelry from the ash
Find the box with the cold hard cash in it
Give it to the next of kin

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin, too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I'll make a desert of my mind
Unfold myself so flat and wide
Have nothing in my line of sight
No cover for my thoughts to hide
Never went to Monaco
But I held your hand in the pocket of my coat
I learned to be in love and learned to be alone
Satisfied body and a hungry soul
I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin, too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I don't wanna be that man on the train
On a gray commute, imagining fame
Sweet relief, I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin, too far out of my skin2Embed
