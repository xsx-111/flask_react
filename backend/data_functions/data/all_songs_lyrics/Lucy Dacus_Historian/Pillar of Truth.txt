Pillar of Truth Lyrics
Your hands are folded
Your eyes are closing
Your words are broken
Your eyes are dry

I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust

You are your mother's child
You're a mother of a mother of a mother now
Raised in the age of the milkman
I can't claim to understand

I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust

Lord, prepare me
For the shadows
For the sparrows
At my window
Lord, have mercy
On my descendants
For they know not what they do
For they know not who you are, Lord
And they know not what to do
I, the anchor, am slowly sinking
Into darkness yet unknown
But the fading light around me
Is full of faces who carry my name

I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust

Lord, be near me
My final hour
I once had sight
But now I'm blind
Oh, I tried to be
A second coming
And if I was
Nobody knew
If my throat can't sing
Then my soul screams out to you!

I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dustEmbed
