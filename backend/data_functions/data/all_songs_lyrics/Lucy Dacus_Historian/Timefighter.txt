Timefighter Lyrics
And I'll get old and I'll get tired
And I won't run into the water
You gotta let me go down
Will you remember me as I am now?

And I know you're strong
I know you're a man-made fortress
But we're alone
And I'm so willing to be proven wrong

And I fought time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

You talk like you don't know the walls are thin
And I don't mind if you don't mind me listening
And I'm tired of all these wires
If I go far enough, will they not follow up?

And I fought time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody
And I fought time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybodyEmbed
