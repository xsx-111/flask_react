Body to Flame Lyrics
Longing for your short hair to grow back to the way you like
Thank you for the gesture
I regret ever implying that you could be better
Didn't mean to empty your perfect body
And fill it with my passing whim

Easily won, weary of losing
Gullible girl, weak and alluring
Will we break our rules, get drunk in the dark
Laughing aloud at the spinning stars?

Believe me, I'm speaking plainly and painfully
Trying to stay elegant, eloquent and delicate to you
I see you holding your breath with your arms outstretched
Waiting for someone to come rip open your chest
You take me aside
To solemnly confide
When it comes the time
You plan to give your body to the flame4Embed
