Yours & Mine Lyrics
I'm afraid of pain, both yours and mine, both yours and mine
I'm afraid of pain, from where it comes and where it falls

Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire, marching away
And you've got nothing to say
And you've got nothing to say
Have you got nothing to say?

For those of you who told me I should stay indoors
Take care of you and yours, take care of you and yours
But me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine (Me and mine)
We've got a long way to go before we get home
'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home

Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire, marching away
And you've got nothing to say
And you've got nothing to say
Have you got nothing to say?
For those of you who told me I should stay indoors
Take care of you and yours, take care of you and yours
But me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine (Me and mine)
We've got a long way to go before we get home
'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home

Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
But me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine (Me and mine)
Me and mine
We've got a long way to go before we get home
'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore7Embed
