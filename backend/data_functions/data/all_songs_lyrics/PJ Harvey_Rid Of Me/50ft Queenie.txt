50ft Queenie Lyrics
Hey I'm one big queen
No one can stop me
Red light, red green
Sat back, I'm watching
I'm number one
Second to no one
No sweat, I'm clean
Nothing can touch me

Tell you my name
F U and C K
50ft Queenie
Force 10 hurricane
Biggest woman
I could have ten sons
Ten gods, ten queens
Ten foot and rising

Hey I'm the king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on, measure me
I'm twenty inches long
Glory, glory
Lay it all on me
50ft Queenie
50 and rising
You bend over
Casanova
No sweat, I'm clean
Nothing can touch me

Hey I'm the king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on, measure me
I'm twenty inches long
Hey I'm the king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on, measure me
I'm thirty inches long
Hey I'm the king of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on, measure me
I'm forty inches long
Hey I'm king the of the world
You oughta hear my song
You come on, measure me
I'm fifty inches long
