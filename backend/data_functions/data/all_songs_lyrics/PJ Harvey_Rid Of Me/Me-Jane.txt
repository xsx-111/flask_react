Me-Jane Lyrics
Oh damn your chest-beating, just you stop your screaming
It's splitting through my head and swinging from the ceiling
Move it over, Tarzan, can't you see I'm bleeding?
I've called you by your first name, good lord it's Me-Jane!

And I'm running
Split head
And I'm moving
I'm Me-Jane
Me-Jane

Oh, damn your chest-beating, just you stop your screaming!
All the time you're hunting, swimming, fishing, breeding
Don't you ever stop and give me time to breathe in?
I've called you by your first name, good lord it's Me-Jane

And I'm running
Split head
And I'm moving
I'm Me-Jane
And I'm trying
To make sense
Of your screaming
Don't load it on me
Don't load it on me
Don't load it all on me

Tarzan, I'm pleading, stop your fucking screaming!
You've got me nailing walls, I'm hanging from the ceiling
Oh, move it over Tarzan! Can't you see I'm bleeding?
Good lord you never stop!

Don't load it on me
Don't load it on me
Don't load it on me

Don't load it on me (Jane)
Don't load it on me (Jane)
Don't load it on me (Jane)
Don't load it on me (Jane)
Don't load it on me (Jane)1Embed
