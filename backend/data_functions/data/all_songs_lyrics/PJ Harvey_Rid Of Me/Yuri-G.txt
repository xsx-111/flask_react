Yuri-G Lyrics
Hey there, Luna
I'd like to tell ya
How sad am I
So love sick I could die

Needing water
My neck's stiff
My head hurts
Been lookin' up all night
Been looking up
Moon, she's so bright

She's so white
She's so clean
I'm telling you
She's everything
I'd give it all
My sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized

Yeah, I wish I was a Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah, I wish I was Yuri-G
Bring back my memory
Told by a doctor
You make a figure
Needles stick in her
She'll be your Luna

I stuck 'em in real clean
I stuck 'em in a mile
I drew her down on me
I drew her with a smile
I'd give it all you see
I'd give my sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized

Yeah, I wish I was a Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah, I thought I was Yuri-G
Bring back my memory

Stuck 'em in
I stuck 'em in real clean
I stuck 'em in a mile
I drew her down on me
I drew her with a smile
I'd give it all you see
I'd give my sorry eyes
Give just everything
She's got me so mesmerized
Yeah, I wish I was a Yuri-G
It's just the things that she does to me
Yeah, I thought I was Yuri-G
Bring back my memory
Yeah, I wish a Yuri-G
I'd let her walk all over me
Yeah, I thought I was Yuri-G

Bring back my memory
Bring back my memory
Bring back my memory1Embed
