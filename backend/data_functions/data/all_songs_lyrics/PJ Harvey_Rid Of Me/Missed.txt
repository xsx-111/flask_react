Missed Lyrics
He should not be hid
He's just too big
In a cloud please come down
I'd put stars at your feet
Put Mars in your head

Show yourself to me
And I'd believe
I'd moan and I'd weep
Fall silent at your speak
I'd burst in
Full to the brim

Mary lost her head
And let it bleed
Came crying back to me
"My son, where's he hid?
Don't deny it
And don't you hide him"

No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No words
No sign
Mary say
"I'm not lying"
How come he's so big?
But good lord he's been hid
Good lord, where you hid?
Ha!

No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him
No, I've missed him1Embed
