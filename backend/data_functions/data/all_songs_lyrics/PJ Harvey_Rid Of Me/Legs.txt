Legs Lyrics
Oh, you're divine
Oh, you're divine

Oh, oh
Did I tell you you're divine?
Oh, oh, oh
Did I ever when you were alive?

Did it hurt when you bled?
Did it, oh lover boy, oh fever head?
I'll bet you never thought I'd try
Your mouth, my love, was open wide

Singing oh
You were going to be my life, dammit!
Oh, oh, oh
You were going to be my life

Did you sing happy day?
Sing it, sing it that time I went away?
Got to ease my aching head
Ooh, no, no other way, cut off your legs
Oh
Oh

Did you ever wish me dead
Oh lover boy, oh fever head?
No you must, no you must not go away
How will you ever walk again?
And I, I might as well be dead

But I could kill you instead1Embed
