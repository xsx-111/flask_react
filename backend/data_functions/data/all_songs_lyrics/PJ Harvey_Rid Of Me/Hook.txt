Hook Lyrics
I was blind
I was lame
I was nothing
'Till you came
And said "Babe
Make you sing
Make you feel
Like some queen"

Said "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Lord, he hooked me
Fish hook and line

And rode in barking mad
With a halo of deep black
'Til my love made me gag
Call him Daddy, take my hand

Said "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Good Lord, he hooked me
Fish hook and line
I'm hooked
Oh higher
Oh beautiful
Oh higher
Oh beautiful
Oh higher

Now I'm blind and I'm lame
Left with nothing but his stain
"Daddy, your maid, she can't sing
She can't feel, she's no queen!"

Said "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Lord he hooked me
Fish hook and line

Said "I'll take you Kathleen
To your home and mine"
Good lord he hooked me
Clean out of time1Embed
