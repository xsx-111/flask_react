Dry Lyrics
I caught it in the face
Coming around again
I thought it was worth waiting
You're caught up in my head
Wet sides from time to time
But mostly I'm just dry

You leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry

You've come all this way
No hair out of place
You put it on the stage
You put right in my face

You leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry

No water well in sight
No water at my sides
I'm sucking on the well
I'm sucking 'till I'm white
But you leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dry
You leave me dryEmbed
