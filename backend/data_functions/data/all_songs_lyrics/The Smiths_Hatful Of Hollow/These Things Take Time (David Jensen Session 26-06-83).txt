These Things Take Time (David Jensen Session 26/06/83) Lyrics
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind
You took me behind a disused railway line
And said, "I know a place where we can go
Where we are not known"
And then you gave me something that I won't forget too soon

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And this is why you will never care

But these things take time
And I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stеpped

I'm spellbound, but a woman divides
And thе hills are alive with celibate cries
But you know where you came from
You know where you're going
And you know where you belong
You said I was ill and you were not wrong

But I can't believe that you'd ever care
And so you never care
But these things take time
I know that I'm
The most inept that ever stepped

Oh, the alcoholic afternoons
When we sat in your rooms
They meant more to me than any
Than any living thing on earth
That had more worth
Than any
Living thing on earth, on earth, on earth
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh

Vivid and in your prime
You will leave me behind
You will leave me behind1Embed
