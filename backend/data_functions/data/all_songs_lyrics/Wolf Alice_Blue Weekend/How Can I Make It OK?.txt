How Can I Make It OK? Lyrics
A moment to change it all
Had life before been so slow?
Urgency takes hold
But to live in fear isn't to live at all

So how can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important
As that to me
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important
As that to me, oh

How do we sell you the world?
Let it in, embrace and uncurl
So fierce, so bold
Someone like you
Should not be left unsold

So how can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important
As that to mе
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important
As that to mе
Oh, okay
Okay
And now a moment to change it all
Had life before been so slow?
Urgency takes hold
But to live in fear isn't to live at all

So how can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
I just want you to be happy
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important
As that to me
How can I make it okay?
Nothing else is as important
As this to me

Okay, oh
