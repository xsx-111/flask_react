Play the Greatest Hits Lyrics
If the fast life is fast
Then why does it creep?
Back at The Castle like 2016
They don't play any music
Take it back to mine
Life seems to move in circles when you take its straight white lines

The taste of someone's lips, their hands placed on my hips
Swaying in the kitchen to all the greatest hits
The taste of someone's lips, hands on hips
Swaying in the kitchen to all the greatest hits
Hey, hey, hey
Play the greatest hits
All the greatest hits

If the fast life is fast
Then why does it creep?
Back at The Castle, it's no feat to be its queen
I don't look too far forward
I definitely don't look back
I leave the present empty but I make it gift wrapped

The taste of someone's lips, their hands placed on my hips
Swaying in the kitchen to all the greatest hits
The taste of someone's lips, hands on hips
Swaying in the kitchen to all the greatest hits
Hey
It isn't loud enough
Hey
It isn't loud enough

Well, the fast life is fast
And I am so weak
I fall in love with the first fucking creep
To open his arms
Matter over mind
Fill in the silence with the first thing you find

All the greatest hits
Play the greatest hits
All the greatest hits
Play the greatest hits

Hey
It isn't loud enough
Hey
It isn't loud enough
(I haven't had enough)
Hey
It isn't loud enough
I haven't had enough3Embed
