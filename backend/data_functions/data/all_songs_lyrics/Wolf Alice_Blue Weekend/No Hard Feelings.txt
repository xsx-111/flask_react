No Hard Feelings Lyrics
No hard feelings, honey
There'll be no bad blood
Losing your love has been hard enough
Life can be short but life can be sweet
No hard feelings, honey
The next time we meet

It's not hard to remember
When it was tough to hear your name
Crying in the bathtub
To "Love Is A Losing Game"
But there's only so much sulking
That the heart can entertain
No hard feelings, honey
Next time you come my way

The threads that kept us together
Were already wеaring thin
Would we ever havе tied the knot?
Well, how long is a piece of string?
And for everything that ends
Something else must begin
No hard feelings, honey
And we both will take the win4Embed
