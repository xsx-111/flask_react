The Last Man on Earth Lyrics
Who were you to ask for anything more?
Do you wait for your dancing lessons to be sent from God?
You'd like His light to shine on you
You've really missed a trick when it comes to love
Always seeking what you don't have, like what you do ain't enough
You'd like a light to shine on you

And every book you take
And you dust off from the shelf
Has lines between lines between lines
That you read about yourself
But does a light shine on you?

And when your friends are talking
You hardly hear a word
You were the first person herе
And the last man on the Earth
But does a light shinе on you?

Who are you to ask for anything else?
The thing you should be asking is for help
You'd like a light to shine on you
Let it shine on you
Let it shine on you

A penny for your truth
Well I hedge my bets on wealth
'Cause it's lies after lies after lies
But do you even fool yourself?
And then the light shines on you

And when your friends are talking
You hardly hear a word
You were the first person here
And the last man on the Earth
But the light7Embed
