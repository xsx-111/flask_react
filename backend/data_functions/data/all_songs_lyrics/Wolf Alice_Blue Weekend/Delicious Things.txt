Delicious Things Lyrics
Could I belong here? The vibes are kinda strong here
The vibes are kinda wrong here, scared to know just what goes on here
Some guy has taken me into his garden
It seems to be some kind of mountain
I'm socially anxious and a long way from home
I've only just learnt my margarita from my mojito, so
Could I belong here? The vibes are kinda strong here
Ask me if I'm from here and I won't say no

I, I won't say no, I'll give it a go
Oh, I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top, a girl like mе
Would you believe I'm in Los Angеles?

This guy asks me where my home is, I say "I don't know it's
Probably where the boy I love and left all on his own is"
He rolls his eyes and cuts a selfish line of blow
He was here for one thing, if he can't get it then he'll go, but
I don't care, I'm in the Hollywood Hills
I'm no longer pulling pints, I'm no longer cashing tills and
I'm alive, I feel like Marilyn Monroe
If you're all poppin' pills, you know I won't say no
I, I won't say no, I'll give it a go
Oh, I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top, a girl like me
Would you believe I'm in Los Angeles?

Don't lose sight
Don't lose sight

The guy from the garden, I think his name is Adam
He's in bed here beside me, though I think he is a bad man
He liked the fact that I play music in a band
He is making a movie and the score needs a hand
Feel like I'm falling, dreams slowly stalling
Extravagance disguised as elegance is boring
I don't belong here, though it really is quite fun here
"Hey, is mum there? It's just me, I felt like calling"

I, I won't say no, I'll give it a go
Oh, I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top, a girl like me
Would you believe I'm in Los Angeles?
Don't lose sight
Don't lose sight
Don't lose sight
Don't lose sight, mm3Embed
