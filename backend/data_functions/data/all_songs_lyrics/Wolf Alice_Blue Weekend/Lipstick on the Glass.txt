Lipstick on the Glass Lyrics
Oh, it could be exciting
Excuse for a change if we don't work the way
We were
Oh, but nothing seems inviting
Except the image of your open arms calling back
To me

I take you back
Yeah, I know it seems surprising when there's lipstick still on the glass
And the full moon rising, but it's me who makes myself mad, mm
I'll take you

Oh, my body does deceive me
Just as did yours
Though we're fighting different wars
In our ways
Oh, but there's no pleasure in resisting
So go ahead and kiss me

I take you back
Yeah, I know it seems surprising when there's lipstick still on the glass
And the full moon rising, but it's me who makes myself mad, mm
I'll take you
Once more, once more
Once more
Once more, once more
Once more
Once more
You know nothing would've needed deciding
Had you just simply asked
But the full moon rising, and it's me

I take you back
Yeah, I know it seems surprising when there's lipstick still on the glass
And the full moon rising, but it's me who makes myself mad, mm
I'll take you7Embed
