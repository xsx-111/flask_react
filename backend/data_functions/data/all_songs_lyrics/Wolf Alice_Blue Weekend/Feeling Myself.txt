Feeling Myself Lyrics
He's had so many lovers
Don't mean he's been pleasing anyone
Doesn't matter 'bout numbers
When it's breaking news that it takes two to love
I was always taught to give
Give and make it good
Just as misunderstood as him
'Cause that's no way to live
And that's no way to play the game of love

Now I'm really feeling myself
Yeah, I really feel myself
(So much better when I, ooh, ooh)

Let's explore the space
It's like we're moving in circles
And my love doesn't takе any shape
I watch you as you're watching me
This lovе's for free
Keep my name on your lips
Let the double L feel like a kiss

(She lifts off out her body)
Now I'm really feeling myself
You can watch me as I feel myself
(So much better when I, ooh, ooh)
It felt like a kiss2Embed
