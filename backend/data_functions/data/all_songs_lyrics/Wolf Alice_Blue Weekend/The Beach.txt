The Beach Lyrics
When will we three meet again?
In thunder, lightning, in rain
Still sink our drinks like every weekend
But I'm sick of circling the drain (drain, drain, drain)

Let me off, let me in
Let others battle
We don't need to battle and we both shall win

When will we meet eye to eye?
We clink the glass but we look at the floor
Are we still friends if all I feel is afraid?
You're not a bitch but just a bit when you're bored

Let me off, let me in
Let others battle
Wе don't need to battle and we both shall win
Let mе off, let me in
Let others battle
We don't need to battle and we both shall win

Pressed in my palm (Pressed in my palm)
Was a stone from the beach (A stone from the beach)
The perfect circle (The perfect circle)
Gave a moment of peace (Gave a moment of peace)
Now I'm lying on the floor (I'm lying on the floor)
Like I'm not worth a chair (Not worth a chair)
I close my eyes and imagine I'm not there3Embed
