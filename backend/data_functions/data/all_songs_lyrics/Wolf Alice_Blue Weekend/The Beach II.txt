The Beach II Lyrics
I sip my wine from a plastic cup
Throw stones in to another
While the sun heats up my liquid rose
And it shines the same fine colour
The tide comes in, as it must go out
Consistent like the laughter
Of the girls on the beach, my girls on the beach
Happy ever after

Okay (It's okay)
Girls on the beach
My girls on the beach
Okay
Girls on the beach, my, my

Skimming stones, I don't care what floats
When I look out beyond the water
The waves lick our feet (lick our feet), our hands meet (our hands meet)
Mother Nature's daughtеrs
And the sun goes down, as it must come up
Consistеnt like the laughter
Of the girls on the beach, my girls on the beach
Happy ever after
Okay (It's okay)
Girls on the beach
My girls on the beach
Okay
Girls on the beach, my

My
Okay
My
Happy ever after
It's okay2Embed
