Safe From Heartbreak (if you never fall in love) Lyrics
I ain't a plaything
To make life exciting
I have feelings
Safe from heartbreak if I never fall in love

As weak as your wording
When you told me you're leaving
Like you don't have feelings
Safe from heartbreak if I never fall in love

Look beyond your wall
Bend your own rules
See how far you fall
'Cause I bet it won't kill you

I ain't a plaything (I ain't a player)
To make life exciting (Life just falls short)
You fucked with my feelings
Safe from heartbreak if I never fall in love

As weak as your wording (Therе are no words)
When you told me you'rе leaving (For what I believe)
Not sure what I believe in
But I'll be safe from heartbreak if I never fall in love
Look beyond your wall
Bend your own rules
See how far you fall
'Cause I bet it won't kill you

I ain't a plaything
To make life exciting
I have feelings
Safe from heartbreak if I never fall in love1Embed
