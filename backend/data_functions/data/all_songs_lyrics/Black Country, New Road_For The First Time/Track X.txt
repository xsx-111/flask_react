Track X Lyrics
You've got great hips
I've been shaking ever since
You told me "No love would live in this house"
Turned out the inside inside out
I tried my best to stay afloat
After I sacrificed the goat
In your name, in the same room where we fucked as kids
With Abraham and Isaac and all of my greatest hits

And I guess, in some way

Dancing to Jerskin, I got down on my knees
I told you I loved you in front of black midi
I told my friend Jack that it could've been you
I know it was funny, but I was struggling too
I left my drink on the eighteenth floor
I thought about jumping and your face when you saw
I thought of my father and proving him wrong
But mostly Mollie and Dylan and my mum

And I guess, in some way5Embed
