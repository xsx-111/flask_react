Opus Lyrics
What we built from Black Country ground
In your car out of this small town
You on back of my new push-bike
Wheelie-ing down Thunder Road tonight
And I never felt so brave
On that unusually forgiving Sunday

What we built to keep ourselves warm
Burnt your hand and charmed the locals
All those mistakes laid out plainly
Anyone could see that the clamp was breaking me!
And one more time
For the record

Everybody's coming up
I guess I'm a little bit late to the party
Everybody's coming up
I guess I'm a little bit late to the party
Now everybody's coming up
I guess I should've had something else to say
And now еverybody's coming up
What we built must fall to the rising flamеs4Embed
