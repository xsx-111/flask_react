Copycat LyricsThey had an accident
But they never noticed anyway
A lack of originality
Couldn't focus on the day
So much for the radio
Everybody sounds the same
Everybody wears the same clothes now
And everybody plays the game
Copycat, copycat, copycat
Copy copy copy copy yourself
Copycat, copycat, copycat
Copy copy copy everyone else
I've got a great idea
I will change things on my own
I see my vision very clear
Wouldn't wanna be another clone
So much for the radio
The radio is sad
Sad, sad, sad
They had an accident
But they never noticed anyway
A lack of originality
Couldn't focus on the day
So much for the radio
Everybody sounds the same
Everybody wears the same clothes now
And everybody plays the game
Copy everyone else
Copy everyone else
Copy everyone else
Copy everyone elseEmbed
