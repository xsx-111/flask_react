Sorry Son Lyrics
Sorry, son, this is what I've done
This is what I've done
It was a long sad supper without you
I had to be cruel to be kind
We have to leave the past behind (La-la-la)
And isn't it strange how people can change? (Ahh)
And isn't it weird how people I feared
They all seem worthless now?

I will ride on my bicycle
I ride thinking of you
As I'm riding on my tricycle, I ride
I see the sun in the trees
And I feel the psychedelic breeze
And I see the sun in the trees
And I feel the psychedelic breeze

Sorry son, this is what I've done
This is what I've done
It was a long sad supper without you
Please don't hold me responsible
I tried, and I tried
It wasn't the same without my brain (Ahh)
It wasn't a game, it wasn't a game, no
Oh, not now
I will ride on my bicycle
I ride thinking of you
As I'm riding on my tricycle, I ride
I see the sun in the trees
And I feel the psychedelic breeze
And I see the sun in the trees
And I feel the psychedelic breeze

La-la-la
Sorry, son
Oh, I am so sorry, sonEmbed
