Fee Fi Fo Lyrics
Fee fi fo, she smells his body
She smells his body
And it makes her sick to her mind
He has got so much to answer for
To answer for
To ruin a child's mind

How could you touch something
So innocent and pure
Obscure?
How could you get satisfaction
From the body of a child?
You're vile, you're...

It's true what people say
God protect the ones who help themselves
In their own way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
It's true what people say
God protect the ones who help themselves
In their own way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ye-a, ee-ee-ee-ee-ye-a
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ye-a, ee-ee-ee yea

He was sitting in her bedroom
In her bedroom
And now what should she do?
She's got so much insecurity
And his impurity
It was a gathering gloom

How could you touch something
So innocent and pure
Obscure?
How could you get satisfaction
From the body of a child ?
You're vile, sick

It's true what people say
God protect the ones who help themselves
In their own way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I often wonder to myself
Who'll protect the ones
Who can't protect themselves?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah !
It's true what people say
God protect the ones who help themselves
In their own way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I often wonder to myself
Who'll protect the ones
Who can't protect themselves?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah !

Ee-ee-ee-ee-ye-a, ee-ee-ee-ee-ye-a
