Desperate Andy LyricsHe always holds on to his girlfriend
That's where he likes to be
He like to wear the ball
And the chain on his neck
A false sense of security
And when he goes he goes with a smile
And when he goes he goes with a smile
And when he goes he goes with a smile
And when he goes he goes with a smile
Desperate Andy a-a-a-a
Re la la la la la la
Desperate Andy a-a-a-a
Re la la la la la la la la la
The world is your oyster now
You can do as you want to do
The world is your oyster now
So go out and get high
And get whatever you want to
Ma-na-na, ma-na-na
Ma-na-na, ma-na-na
Ma-na-na, ma-na-na
Ma-na-na, ma-na-na
He used to be a closet biker they say
A 1957 BSA
He used to collect writing paper
They wonder wonder wonder
Wonder wonder of
Desperate Andy a-a-a-a
Ra la la la la la la
Isn't it dandy a-a-a-a
Ra la la la la
Desperate Andy a-a-a-a
Ra la la la la la la la la la
The world is your oyster now
You can do as you want to do
The world is your oyster now
So go out and get high
And get whatever you want to
The word is your oyster now
You can do as you want to do
The world is your oyster now
So go out and get laid
And get whatever you want to
The world is your oyster
The world is yours
It's yours it's yours
It's yours it's yours
It's yours it's yours
It's yours it's yoursEmbed
