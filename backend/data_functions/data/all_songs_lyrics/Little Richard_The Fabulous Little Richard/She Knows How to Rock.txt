She Knows How to Rock LyricsI'm goin' downtown
Get me a rockin' chair
Gon' let my baby rock me
On away from here
She knows how to rock me
Lord, she sure can rock me
If ya ever been rocked
You know just what I mean
Now, she can rock me up
Rock me, down
Rock me, cross
Lord, she rocks me 'round
She knows how to rock me
She sure can rock me
If ya ever been rocked
You know just what I mean
'Let's rock, man'
Now, she rocks me in
Rocks me out
She knows what it's all about
She sure can rock me
Ooh, rock me
If ya ever been rocked
You know just what I mean
'Rock with me, now'
She rocks me to the right
Rocks me to the left
Sometime, I b'lieve
She gon' rock me to death
She knows how to rock me
Oh, rock me
If ya ever been rocked
You know just what I mean
'Lord, Lord, Lord!
But now my gal
Is gettin' kind-a funny
Don't wanna rock
If I don't give her my money
But she sho' can rock me
Knows how to rock me
Now, if you ever been rocked
You'll know just what I meanEmbed
