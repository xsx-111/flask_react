Girl with the Red Balloon Lyrics
There's a pub on the south side of town
Time stands still while there's still wine around
She's the one in the calico
The one who's always and never alone

Did she let him go
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Does she even know
She's the girl with the red balloon?

Keep her glass full of cheap champagne
She will tell of the man with no name
Smoke and mirrors have done her in
She's in love and she won't be again

Did she let him go
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Does she even know
She's the girl with the red balloon?

So lovely
So lonely
Floating away
[Chorus: Joy Williams, John Paul White & Both
Did she let him go
Or did the four winds blow him away?
Does she even know?
Did she let him go
Did the four winds blow him away?
Does she even know
She's a girl
She's a girl with the red balloon?1Embed
