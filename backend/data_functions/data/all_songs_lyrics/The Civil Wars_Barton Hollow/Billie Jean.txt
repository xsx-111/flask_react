Billie Jean Lyrics
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Oh, think twice
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Then she came and stood right by me
With the smell of sweet perfume
It happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

So, Billie Jean is not my lover (she's just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (she's just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover1Embed
