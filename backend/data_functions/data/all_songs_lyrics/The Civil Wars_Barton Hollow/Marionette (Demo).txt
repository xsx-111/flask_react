Marionette (Demo) Lyrics
You put the words in my mouth
You are the one who spat them right out
Oh, you better wait with me
You pulled a string to my heart
Don’t know where you start, don’t know where I start
Oh, you cast a spell on me

Dance, dance, dance
Dance, marionette
Dance, dance, dance
Won’t you dance for me?

You had me fooled for a while
You were the one that painted that smile
Now it’s beginning to fade
Oh, just keep pulling me
Oh, you are the one who follows my lead
So, while the music plays

Oh, dance, dance, dance
Dance, marionette
Dance, dance, dance
Won’t you dance for me?1Embed
