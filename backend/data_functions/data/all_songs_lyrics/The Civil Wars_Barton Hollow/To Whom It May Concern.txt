To Whom It May Concern Lyrics
Why are you so far from me?
In my arms is where you are to be
How long will you make me wait?
I don't know how much more I can take

I missed you
But I haven't met you
Oh, but I want to
How I do

Slowly counting down the days
'Til I finally know your name
The way your hand feels round my waist
The way you laugh, the way your kisses taste

I missed you
But I haven't met you
Oh, but I want to
How I do

How I do
I've missed you
But I haven't met you
Oh, how I miss you
But I haven't met you
Oh, but I want to
Oh, how I want to

Dear whoever you might be
I'm still waiting patientlyEmbed
