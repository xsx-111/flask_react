Goodbye Girl Lyrics
You forgot your grandmother’s scarf
As you walked away that day in the park
I watched you disappear into the city
Smaller and smaller you faded
That’s that

Say goodbye and don’t look back
So long to happy ever after
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl

I remember that look, the last one you gave me
A kiss on my cheek as you were leaving
The last thing you said was, “I’ll see you again”
But we both know we won’t
That’s that

Say goodbye and don’t look back
So long to happy ever after
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl
Never mind how long it lasted
You’re still the best thing that never happened
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl
Ooh, I’ll move on
Yes, I’ll move on
There is no use in
Chasing

Say goodbye and don’t look back
So long to happy ever after
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl
Never mind how long it lasted
You’re still the best thing that never happened
You are my goodbye
Goodbye girl

Oh, you’re still my goodbye
Goodbye girlEmbed
