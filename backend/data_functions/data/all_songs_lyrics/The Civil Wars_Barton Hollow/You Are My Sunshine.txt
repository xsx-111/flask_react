You Are My Sunshine Lyrics
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamnt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head and I cried

I'll always love you and make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me and love another
You'll regret it all some day

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me
When I awake, my poor heart pains
So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive and take all the blame
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Oh, please don't take my sunshine away
Oh, please don't take my sunshine awayEmbed
