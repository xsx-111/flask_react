Dance Me to the End of Love Lyrics
Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
And dance me to the end of love
Please dance me to the end of love

Oh, let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
And dance me to the end of love
Please dance me to the end of love

Love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love
Love, love, love
[Verse 3: Joy Williams, John Paul White & Both
Dance me to the wedding now
Dance me on and on
And dance me very tenderly
Dance me very long
We're both of us
Beneath our love, we're both of us above
And dance me to the end of love
Won't you dance me
To the end of love?
Love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love
Love, love, loveEmbed
