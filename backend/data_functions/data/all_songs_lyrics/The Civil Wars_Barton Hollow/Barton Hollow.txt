Barton Hollow Lyrics
I'm a dead man walking here
But that's the least of all my fears
Ooh, underneath the water
It's not Alabama clay
That gives my trembling hands away
Ooh, please forgive me, Father

Ain't going back to Barton Hollow
Devil gonna follow me e'er I go
Won't do me no good washing in the river
Can't no preacher man save my soul

Did that full moon force my hand?
Or that unmarked hundred grand?
Ooh, underneath the water
Ooh, please forgive me, Father

Miles and miles in my bare feet
Still can't lay me down to sleep
If I die before I wake
I know the Lord, my soul won't
Take
I'm a dead man walking
I'm a dead man walking
Just keep walking and running and running for miles
Keep walking and running and running for miles
Keep walking and running and running for miles
Ain't going back to Barton Hollow
Devil gonna follow me e'er I go
Won't do me no good washing in the river
Can't no preacher man save my soul5Embed
