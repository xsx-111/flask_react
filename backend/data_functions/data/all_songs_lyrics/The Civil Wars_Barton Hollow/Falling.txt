Falling Lyrics
Haven't you seen me sleepwalking?
'Cause I've been holding your hand
Haven't you noticed me drifting?
Oh, let me tell you, I am

Tell me it's nothing
Try to convince me
That I'm not drowning
Oh, let me tell you, I am

Please, please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling
Out of love with you

Why am I feeling so guilty?
Why am I holding my breath?
Worry about everyone but me
And I just keep losing myself

Tell me it's nothing
Try to convince me
That I'm not drowning
Oh, let me tell you, I am
Please, please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling
Out of love with you

Won't you read my mind?
Don't you let me lie here
And die here

Please, please tell me you know
I've got to let you go
I can't help falling
Out of love with you

Haven't you noticed?
