I Want You Back Lyrics
When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to go and take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me in your heart?
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
Now that I see you in his arms
I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Trying to live without your love
Is like one long sleepless night
Let me show you, boy, that I really know I know wrong from right
'Cause every street you're walking on, you leave tear stains on the ground
Follow boy, I didn't even want, didn't even want you around

Oh, baby, give me one more chance
To show you I love you
Won't you please let me in your heart?
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
Let you go, baby
Now that I see you in his arms
Oh, now that I see you in his arms
I want you back
I want you back
I want you backEmbed
