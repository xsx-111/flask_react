Radio Ad LyricsEveryone knows the best Dead is live
The Grateful Dead: a two record set, recorded live at Winterland, Manhattan Center and the late, lamented Fillmore East; on Warner Brothers' Records
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running, running
Lord, I wonder if you care?
Go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny, go, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode
The Grateful Dead on Warner Brothers' Records
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee, yeah-hahEmbed
