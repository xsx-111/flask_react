Fight for All the Wrong Reasons Lyrics
Well, I wanted you
I wanted no one else
I thought it through
I got you to myself
You got off
Every time you got on to me
I got caught up
In favorable slavery
Was it wrong? Was it wrong?

I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
'Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons

Well, you know my friends
They know your enemies
I'd pretend
Not to hear what they said to me
'Cause I got off
Every time you got on to me
Was it wrong to go along with insanity?
Was it wrong? Was it wrong?
I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
'Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons

You know Iâ€™m the best
When I stick it on your chest
I know you don't care
I can stick it anywhere
On the bus, it's the best
When I blow it on your chest
I know you don't care
I can shove it anywhere

I guess it wasn't what I wanted
Wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day I got
I want it all to go away
I guess it wasn't what I wanted
Wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day I got
I want it all to go away
I guess it wasn't what I wanted
Wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day I got
I want it all to go away
I guess it wasn't what I wanted
Wasn't really what I thought
Thought it was the day I got
I want it all to go away
I guess it wasn't really right
I guess it wasn't meant to be
It didn't matter what they said
'Cause we were good in bed
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasons
No, it didn't matter what I tried
It's just a little hard to leave
When you're going down on me
I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
For all the wrong reasonsEmbed
