Lucky Man LyricsSome of us want a fast car
Some of us want to stand and gaze
Some of us pine for the great outdoors
Some of us won't leave the house for days
Some of us have died for their freedom
Some are quite happy in the cage
Some think a wild time
Is what they want at night
But freedom to sleep
Would be complete delight
I truly am
A lucky man
I have everything that I want
Some want diamonds and trinkets and gold
The perfect body and the perfect skin
Witnesses to their good deeds
Willing accomplices to their sin
Some of us pray for absolution
Some want sex and call it love
But freedom to cheat's not something I need tonight
I truly am
A lucky man
I have everything that I want
Some of us want to be a rockstar
Some of us just want more and more and more and more
But I'm not so sure, I think I've been there before..
I truly am
A lucky man
I have everything that I want
I truly am
A lucky man
I have everything that I want
I truly am
A lucky man
I finally have everything that I wantEmbed
