Pour My Love LyricsLids that close and time that slows the rapid eye
There is no dreaming in the grave
You'll never look into those eyes again
In this world, in this world
So bend your head
The way that flowers bend their heads
I'll pour upon it my love like rain
Bend your head
The way that flowers bend their heads
Love has died
But love is gonna live again
People change and they turn strange and so will I
It makes no odds how we behave
We'll never work out how to live in peace
In this world, with this world
So bend your head
The way that flowers bend their heads
I'll pour upon it my love like rain
Love has died but love is gonna live again
I'll pour upon it my love like rain
In a place where flowers rot and die
In a place where truth lies down and shacks up with the lie
There is still you, there is still you
And longer than this life gives life to you
Bend your head
The way that flowers bend their heads
I'll pour upon it my love like rain
Love has died but love is gonna live again
I'll pour upon it my love like rain
My love like rain, my love like rain, my love like rainEmbed
