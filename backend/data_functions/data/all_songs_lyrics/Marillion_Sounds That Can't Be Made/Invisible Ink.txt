I left a note each day under your pillow
That I wrote in invisible ink
All you have to do is breathe on them
And you might read them written there in pink
You might find out what's inside me
Maybe it's something that might amuse
As you watch my words appearing
The fear will go
And everything will flow
I'm hoping you don't throw my little notes away
I wouldn't blame you
After all, there's nothing they appear to say
It's not a game, it's simply fear
Stops them being clear
'Cause I'm hoping you don't throw my little notes away
I wouldn't blame you
After all, there's nothing they appear to say
It's not a game, it's simply fear
Stops them being clear
It's not a game, it's simply fear
That stops them being clear
I'm being optimistic here
I'm being optimistic here
Love or fear
Which do you have for me
Love and fear
Which do you have for me
'Cause I'm hoping you don't throw my little notes away
I wouldn't blame you
After all, there's nothing they appear to say
It's not a game, it's simply fear
Always stops them being clear
'Cause I'm hoping
Yes I'm hoping, I'm hoping
It's not a game
It's not a game
Looks like a game
But it's not a game..Embed
