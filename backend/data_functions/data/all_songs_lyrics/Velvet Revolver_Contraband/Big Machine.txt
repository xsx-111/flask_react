Big Machine Lyrics
I don't know
Because she says so
He's a faggot boy
The TV says so
He's a junkie piece of shit because he says so

All that first-class jet set brings me down, down, down
All that first-class drug shit brings me down, down, down

It's a big machine, it's a big machine
We're all slaves to a big machine
It's a big machine, it's a big machine
We're all slaves to a big machine
All tied up to a big machine
I got houses
Got cars
I got a wife
I got kids
Got money in the bank

Get away without borders
I'm a slave, New World Order
I guess I chose to be
I guess I chose to be
I guess I chose to be
I guess I chose to be
All that first-class jet set brings me down, down, down
All that first-class drug shit brings me down, down, down

It's a big machine, it's a big machine
We're all slaves to a big machine
It's a big machine, it's a big machine
We're all slaves to a big machine
All tied up to a big machine
I got houses
Got cars
I got a wife
I got kids
Got money in the bank

Hope I teach my son how to be a man
Now before he hits thirty-five
Comic book lives don't really happen in real life, do they, now?
Hope I teach my son how to be a man
Now before he hits thirty-five
Comic book lives don't really happen in real life, do they, now?

I don't know
Because she says so
He's a faggot boy
The TV says so
He's a junkie piece of shit because he says so
All that first-class jet set brings me down, down, down
All that first-class drug shit brings me down, down, down

It's a big machine, it's a big machine
We're all slaves to a big machine
It's a big machine, it's a big machine
We're all slaves to a big machine
All tied up to a big machine
I got houses
Got cars
I got a wife
I got kids
Got money in the bankEmbed
