Illegal I Song Lyrics
One fine day
I'll settle down
When you bloody me
I ran aground
With my broken face
And fisted cuff
Fuck the rest and
All their stuff

I don't anymore
I don't anymore

Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying

Another way
A battleground
A ready teller whore
That makes no sound
Keep the money, bitch
Keep the stuff
Fly around the world
And keep it up
I don't anymore
I don't anymore

Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying

It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
It's killing time on the streets, all hate Sunday
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying there
Just look and you'll see me
Lying there, lying

Just look and you'll
Just look and you'll
Just look and you'll
Just look and you'll
Just look and you'll
Just look and you'll
Just look and you'llEmbed
