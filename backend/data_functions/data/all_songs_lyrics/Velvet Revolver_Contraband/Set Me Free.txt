Set Me Free Lyrics
You operate and motivate on synthetic fuel
You're mother nature and an atom bomb
As long as you're kept full of pretty bodies
Your little secret will be safe with me

Around again, insane again
It comes again and sets me free

So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free

You're kept alive and polarized with one thing in mind
Metabolizing everything that you see
But now and then, or a little later
Now I'm gonna take you down with me

Around again, insane again
She comes again and sets me free

So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So take me down
Take me down, down, down, down
Take me down, take me down
So take me down
Take me down, down, down, down
Take me down, take me down

So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free ('cause I think you need my soul)
So set me free, set me free
'Cause I think you need my soul
Set me free, set me free

My freedom!
My freedom!
My freedom!
My freedom!
My freedom!Embed
