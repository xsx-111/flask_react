Sucker Train Blues Lyrics
Hands are shakin', got your finger on the trigger
Jesus ain't complainin', gonna figure it out
Somebody raped my tapeworm abortion
Come on, motherfucker, and deliver the cow

Brain and body melting while there's roaches multiplyin'
It's the alien infection, it's the comin' of Christ
All these sentimental halos and these consequential angels
While I'm runnin' with the Devil, don't deliver the fight

Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold
Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold

Yeah, and when I want to
Yeah, I will find you
Yeah, and when I want to
Yeah, I will blind you

Brains are frying while the kings and queens are dying
Satan won the race and the miracle mile
Somebody raped my tapeworm abortion
Come on, motherfuckers, and deliver the cow
Brain and body melting while there's roaches multiplyin'
It's the alien infection, it's the comin' of Christ
All these sentimental halos and these consequential angels
While I'm runnin' with the Devil don't deliver the fight

Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold
Don't look at me now
Fell too fast your wings won't hold

Yeah, and when I want to
Yeah, I will find you
Yeah, and when I want to
Yeah, I will blind you

It's all over me now
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And what's come over me now?
Let me go, let me go, let me go
It's all over me now
Let me go, let me go, let me go
And what's come over me now?

(Johnny sat at the old Oaktree
Cut off his hand, what did he see?
All of the animals are dead
The rats have crawled through his house
And out through their head
One of them ate a hole in the sky
To believe this would be a fate worse than dying)

Yeah, and when I want to
Yeah, I will find you
Yeah, and when I want to
Yeah, I will blind you
Yeah
I will find you
I will blind youEmbed
