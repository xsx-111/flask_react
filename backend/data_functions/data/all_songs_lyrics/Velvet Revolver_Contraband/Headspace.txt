Headspace Lyrics
Me, I'm a man
Who is trudging best I can
Through a minefield built to blast
Can I make it? Will I last?

Free my mind, levitate
Don't let any of those fuckers in my headspace

Please let me be
No more questions, no more needs
You're the cancer, you're the leech
Sent to bleed me of disease

Free my mind, levitate
Don't let any of those fuckers in my headspace
Let me go my own way
Burn the rest of them that try to keep me enchained

Living, taking chances
Isn't all that it's meant to be (Meant to be)
Dying with your face on a T-shirt
Isn't all that original (All that original)
Me, I'm the man
Will I make it? Will I last?

Free my mind, levitate
Don't let any of those fuckers in my headspace
Let me go my own way
Burn the rest of them that try to keep me enchained

Living, taking chances
Isn't all that it's meant to be (Meant to be)
Dying with your face on a T-shirt
Isn't all that original (All that original)

My headspace
My headspace
