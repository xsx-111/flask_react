Spectacle LyricsTake two to break and three to go
Hold me back you spectacle (Mother Fucker yeah)
Kick me down with broken bones
You picked a fight now stand your ground
You talk about it
Don't know what you want
In the back of someone else's car
You write the list
Well write me off
Rocket bitch is blasting off (Right on target yeah)
Boots laced up I'm here to go
In the end I'll stand alone
You talk about it
Don't know what you want
In the back of someone else's car
You lied about it
Bled another heart
Then began to fall apart
It rains and you fall back down again
It begins to rain and I'll knock you right back down again
You incessant bitch you lied in wait for the last time now
I'm standing now
I'm standing nowEmbed
