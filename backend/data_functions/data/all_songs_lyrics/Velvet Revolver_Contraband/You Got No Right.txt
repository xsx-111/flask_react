You Got No Right LyricsI fell through the ice
She won't be coming back again
It never wins to lie
She said you'll never have no rights
(She said you'll never have no rights, no rights)
I've took it farther on the outside
I've took it nearly to the brink
And if you've seen me on the outside
You would have barely seen me breathe
Funny right here I find myself
Inside a paper cup
Without a warning or a reason
It's a treason
With no answer
You got no right
To keep me waiting here
You got no right
To keep the pain in here
That holds the crown
And if I fall apart on the outside
(You really don't believe me)
And if I take it to the brink
And if I fall apart on the outside
(You really don't believe me)
You would have barely seen me breathe
And if I meet you out tonight
Will you be loving me forever?
It's always over after the night
It's always colder after the night
I broke through the ice
She won't be coming back again
It's been a year and a night
And if I fall apart on the outside
(You really don't believe me)
And if I take it to the brink
And if I fall apart on the outside
(You really don't believe me)
You would have barely seen me breathe
And if I fall apart on the outside
(She said you'll never have no rights)
And if I fall apart on the outside
(She said you'll never have no rights)
And if I fall apart on the outside
(She said you'll never have no rights)
And if I fall apart on the outsideEmbed
