Do it For the Kids Lyrics
Went too fast, I'm out of luck and I don't even give a fuck

I wanna be your man-child
Let's all go it hog-wild
She said "I'll see you later"
I always gravitate to her
Let's all meet at the station
No heavy concentration
We could all hook up there
The kids are all alright there

Should we go out later?
Showtime for strangers

Don't ya give a fuck anymore, now?
She's givin' up on you, now
"Do it for the kids", they say
It ain't about you, anyway
I say we're all grown up, now
And sex ain't so safe, now
"It's all in the groove", they say
Doesn't matter, anyway
Should we go out later?
Showtime for strangers
Should we go out later?
Showtime for strangers

Keep me runnin' like a deer in the headlights
All for nothing, I thought
Just the ransom I had bought
About the day I tried to tame her
Never tried to blame her
Just a game that I had bought


Let's all meet at the station
No heavy concentration
The kids are all alright there
Went too fast, I'm out of luck and I don't even give a fuck

Should we go out later?
Showtime for strangers
Should we go out later?
Showtime for strangers
Should we go (should we go) out later?
(Went too fast, I'm out of luck and I don't even give a fuck)
Showtime (showtime) for strangers
(Went too fast, I'm out of luck and I don't even give a fuck)Embed
