Superhuman LyricsI'm a superman
I wanna be your superman
I'm a superman
I wanna be your superman
What you get is a crash-course to be a man
But a man is a destination never known
Sometimes dressed up like
A red hot lady in pumps
Don't think she can get enough
Always feel like she's running on a hamster wheel
Getting high, crashing cars and making mistakes
Keeping her face packed with cocaine
Her face is numb
Your faith is gone
I'm travelling on now
I'm making plans now
Cocaine, alcohol
Lady-lay, withdrawal
Cocaine, alcohol
Lady-lay, withdrawal
Keep it comin' in a world that's blown up wild
Keep it comin' in a world that's bred her style
We're all runnin' from the goose
She's high on cocaine
There's a noose swimmin' right between her legs to her brain
We're all in need of a superhuman woman now
We're all in need of a superhuman woman now
To rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Throw the rope around her neck
And get the show on the road
I'm travelling on now
I'm making plans now
Cocaine, alcohol
Lady-lay, withdrawal
Cocaine, alcohol
Lady-lay, withdrawal
I'm travelling on now
I'm making plans now
What's she thinking
She'll never get enough
What's she thinking
She'll never get enough
What's she thinking
She'll never get enough
What's she thinking
She'll never get enough
What's she thinking
She'll never get enough
What's she thinking
She'll never get enough
What's she thinking
She'll never get enough
What's she thinking
She'll never get enough
Cocaine, alcohol
Lady-lay, withdrawal
Cocaine, alcohol
Lady-lay, withdrawalEmbed
