Once Upon the Sea of Blissful Awareness LyricsWaves of the soft spring wind
Love's flood tide is rising full
The moon of love is rising full
Sea of beauty
The moon of love is rising full
Love's flood tide
Some laugh, some weep, some dance for joy
My mind craves nectar day and night
Like a blue lotus floating on the sea of love
Lingering in ashantically
Lingering in the akashic realms
Lingering in, lingering in the realms
Blue lotus floats, floating, floating..
Some laugh, some weep, some dance for joy
My mind craves nectar day and nightEmbed
