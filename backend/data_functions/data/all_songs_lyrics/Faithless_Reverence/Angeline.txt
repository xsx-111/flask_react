Angeline LyricsYou've been out on the tiles
Winning the smiles of men of low persuasion
But I know you drink yourself crawling in the street until dawn
Girl you look like a bad dream
You've been places I've never been
Come home, come home Angeline
Come home, come home Angeline
You've been places I've never been
You took the small change from the job in the hall
Be back in an hour but you're not back at all
The children are crying, the flowers are dying
There's no food on the table
I don't think I'm able to cope
You've been places I've never been
Come home, come home Angeline
Come home, come home Angeline
You've been places I've never been
Cheap perfume and alcohol, dancing on tables
With kissing for strangers all laughing and howling
And jokes and tall tales that ain't funny at all
Bluffers and smugglers, boozers and gamblers
Jump old queens and tarts at the babbled bar
Oh, they've been pushing you too far
Come home, come home Angeline
Come home, come home Angeline
You've been places I've never been
Come home, come home Angeline
Come home, come home Angeline
You've been places I've never beenEmbed
