Baseball Cap LyricsOh, smack, there goes my baseball cap I'm on the floor
I think I took a bruise to my jaw
Jumped me from behind at least three, maybe four
I never see my hat no more
Oh, smash. There goes my baseball cap
It's gone, gone, gone, gone
I can't get it back
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap
It's gone, gone, gone, gone
I can't get it back
14 years old and hard to the core
I'm walking home making plans for war
My hands was cut, my uncle say 'what's up?'
Let me guess, your clothes are in a mess, you're in distress
Sit down, take five and let me look at your knees
Your still alive son, please take it easy
Sometimes you have to let the world know you're not bluffing
But enough is enough, don't lose your life over nothing
Scuffling in the street is no way to die
And I don't want to have to meet your mama's eye
So try and listen hard before you fall into the trap
Of making war over a baseball cap
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap
It's gone, gone, gone, gone
I can't get it back
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap
It's gone, gone, gone, gone
I can't get it back
I sat back, had a think
My uncle poured a drink
I had a little cry, my eye started to blink
'cause what occured from his word to me
Sounds absurd, but I
Heard the love in his voice for me
I made a choice, It was like Snap
What's a cap when I got something real like that
I can measure it, treasure it, and at my leisure
Sit down with those who mean the most to me
The baseball cap was a ghost, this is real to me
"You got steel, son" My uncle's talkin'
"Takes a champion to walk and keep walking"
"Drink your drink, and let the words sink in
Say goodnight to your mom and think again"
So I took my 14 years up to bed
Everything he said taking root in my head
I shed all my tears, and let my 14 years
Relax..
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap
It's gone, gone, gone, gone
I can't get it back
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap
It's gone, gone, gone, gone
I can't get it back
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap
It's gone, gone, gone, gone
I can't get it back
Oh, smash, there goes my baseball cap
It's gone, gone, gone, gone
I can't get it backEmbed
