Flowerstand Man Lyrics'Bout a month ago
I'd never seen your face
I'd never heard your voice
'Bout a month ago
I am a careful hunter
And I had to search
Before I found your love
'Bout a month ago
For you my boy are the Flowerstand Man
You brought such colour to this place
For you my boy are the Flowerstand Man
With you I am laid bare
I don't care if every river runs so dry
I don't care if every species were to die
I don't care about the ozone layer
I wouldn't notice if it wasn't there, oh no
I don't care if we sell coke to Africa
I don't care about apartheid
I wouldn't notice if the poor get better
I don't care about the starving who've died
For my boy when, when you live in me
I don't care about anything but you
For my boy when, when you live in me
I don't care about anything but you
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me homeEmbed
