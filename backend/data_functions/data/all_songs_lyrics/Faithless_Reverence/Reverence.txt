Reverence Lyrics(Maxi Jazz)
My name is
Maxi Jazz and I ain't no joke
I make you choke on the mic
When I go for broke
When I come into a jam I tear off my shirt
I have no knowledge of fear, cause I'm here to do work
Uh
Yeah
Watch me ride..
Take my words and the bass
Taste and then swallow me
No chasing the devil
Cause you're level if you follow me
For quality, and I make no apology
For linking my thinking with computer technology
'Cause this is like a modern day hymn
For the new church, I search for the truth
I got a hole in my tooth, I'm uncouth, yes sir
I'm from a street university where we
Learn to earn even in times of adversity
And I would find the easy way out of a hard time
Petty crimes, some time but now I'm inclined to find
A fresh direction, kiss me neck, check out the funky section
'Cause this is the part where I start to rip up words
A comfort coming straight from my heart
I'm not a mystic
My views are realistic, simplistic
One special brew I get pissed quick
And get sick so I don't do it no more
I won't find peace of mind
Rolling around on the floor
The point I wanna make is
You can never escape from your fate
The mistake is to take without giving
From within, You wanna know how I'm living?
I'm cool..
I'm looking after myself
And I could never place wealth before my spirit
I feel it's unhealthy
The devil creep around ya, so stealthy stealthy
'Til you get bold, rush the gold
And before you're much older, your soul is sold
And where's it gettin ya?
Competition starts sweating ya
Golddiggers setting you up
Soon be forgetting your existence
Do ya need a for instance
I hafta admire your persistence
In sticking to a game plan
That brings ya pain man
And at the end of the day nothing is gained
So listen to the voice within
I'll see ya later
Pay heed to the Grand Oral Disseminator

Quiet, still, you feel there's nothing going on
Until you realize the space behind your eyes
Is filling up with something like peace
As your thoughts cease and
Pleasure grows in your soul
I ain't a Christian, sometimes I feel like dissin' 'em
But listen, I'm just tryin' to tell you, what I know
If you could once relax
Chill to the max, these words on wax
Would cause sweet bells to ring in your soul
If I say God is alive I know you wanna know why
Babies die, food don't grow, why trains smash, planes crash
Situation mash and slam bam your fellow man
Money's in fashion, huh, it ain't rational
Because damn it, he didn't just give us the planet
And its wealth, deep inside your soul he left a piece of himself
The lord is in here. His voice is small
You keep lying and trying
Denying the call From inside
You can't hide responsibility
So decide from today just how it's going to be
Thou shalt have no other god but me
He can set you free, see
But you have to listen
Now who's that false idol
I see you kissing
Money, success and untold wealth, good health
And all you have to do is love yourself
It's a fact you'll attract all the things that you lack
So just chill
And get off the racetrack
And take a pace back, face facts
It's your decision
You don't need eyes to see
You need vision
Continue to view the lord as being separated
And You're living a lie that's been perpetrated
For many centuries, I wanna mention these facts in my rap
Huh, I don't sing
But I want to share the peace that they bring
My name is G.O.D
