Salva Mea Lyrics
How can I change the world
If I can't even change myself?
How can I change the way I am?
I don't know, I don't know

I wanna take a look at the world behind these eyes
Every nook, every cranny reorganize
Realize my face don't fit the way I feel
What's real?
I need a mirror to check my face is in place
In case of upheaval, fundamental movement below
What's really going on I wanna know
But yo, it don't show on the outside, so slide
Just below my skin I'm screaming...
I need a mirror for my spirit
Yeah, can you hear it?
When I get deep, wanna hear my soul sleep
Not drowning, tumbling around and around in the voices
Like a crowd in my head so loud
I wonder what it's like to be dead
I hope it's quiet, noise in my head like a riot
Any remedy you have for me I'll try it
Just below my skin I'm screaming...
I'm going deep, so deep that I can't sleep
The pills ain't cheap but the bill is deep
So I lick a fifth of booze and a spliff
Try to snooze
But whose dream am I in? This is win or lose
Put down the drink. Try not to think
Let it go, fundamental movement below
And yo, reality is dreaming
Just below my skin I'm screaming...1Embed
