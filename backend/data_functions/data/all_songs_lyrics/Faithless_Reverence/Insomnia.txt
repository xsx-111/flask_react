Insomnia Lyrics
And here we are
Half past three in the morning
I can't get no sleep
Yeah
Yeah
I never sleep
I never sleep
I never sleep
I never sleep
I never sleep

Uh
Yeah, I only smoke weed when I need to
And I need to get some rest---yo, where's the cess?
I confess, I burned a hole in the mattress
Yes, yes, it was me, I plead guilty
And at the count of three I pull back the duvet
Make my way to the refrigerator
One dry potato inside, no lie, not even bread
Jam, when the light above my head went bam!
I can't see, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me and let me dream
About making mad love on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no relief, I'm wide awake in my kitchen
It's black and I'm lonely
Oh, if I could only get some sleep
Creeky noises make my skin creep
I need to get some sleep
I can't get no sleep9Embed
