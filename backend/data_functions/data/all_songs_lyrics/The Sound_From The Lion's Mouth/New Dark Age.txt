New Dark Age Lyrics
In the darkest times
Darkest fears are heard
And from the safest places
Come the bravest words
Some make a quiet life
To keep this scared old world at bay
The dogs are howling on the street outside
So they close the curtains, hope they go away

And it's pressure from all sides
Coming down around our ears
Stuck in this room without a door
Scratched away at the walls for years
All we've got to show is the dust on the floor
And here it comes, a new dark age

I catch your eyes
Before they fall to the ground
We're running out of time, breath and steam
We're running down
They're burning witches
Up on punishment hill
Dying proof in the power of authority
To exact it's will
In the darkest times
Darkest fears are heard
And from the safest places
Come the bravest words

And it's pressure from all sides
Coming down around our ears
Stuck in this room without a door
Scratched away at the walls for years
All we've got to show is the dust on the floor
And we've broken our fingers
Broken our faith
Broken our hearts so many times
They can't be broken anymore
Scratched away at the walls for years
All we've got to show is the dust on the floor
And here it comes, a new dark age

Here it comes
Here it comes, a new dark age
Here it comes
Here it comes, a new dark age
Here it comes
Here it comes, a new dark age
Here it comes
Here it comes, a new dark age
Here it comes, here it comes3Embed
