Silent Air Lyrics
Thunder in the air
Before a storm that rips
Anger in my heart
A finger on my lips

You showed me that silence
That haunts this troubled world
You showed me that silence
Can speak louder than words

Words end in disaster
On the rocks, in pieces
I know something lives on there
But I can't say what it is

You showed me that silence
That haunts this troubled world
You showed me that silence
Can speak louder than words

Thunder in the air
Before a storm that rips
Anger in my heart
A finger on my lips
You showed me that silence
That haunts this troubled world
You showed me that silence
Can speak louder than words
You showed me that silence
That haunts this troubled world
You showed me that silence
Can speak louder than wordsEmbed
