Sense of Purpose Lyrics
Look in my eyes
See the lust and the love
Look in my eyes
When I'm talking to you
I'll take my life
Into my own hands
I'm the one that I will blame
I'm the one that understands

What are we going to do?
While we still got the strength to move
What are we going to do?
I'm asking, I'm asking you

A call to arms, a call to use arms
A call to brains, a call to use some brains
A call to the heart, a call to have a heart
To have a sense of purpose again

Are we where we want to be
All wrapped up in our safety?
Comfort and complacency
It hurts me, it hurts me so
What are we going to do?
While we still got the strength to move
What are we going to do?
I'm asking, I'm asking you1Embed
