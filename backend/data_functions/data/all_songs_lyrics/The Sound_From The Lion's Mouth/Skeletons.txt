Skeletons Lyrics
There's a gaping hole in the way we are
With nothing to fill it up anymore
No flesh, no blood, just broken bone
A frame to hang our lives from

We're living like skeletons
We're living like skeletons

Won't someone wake the dead in me?
Won't someone shake the dust off me?
Give me water, give me bread
But don't give me up for dead

We're living like skeletons
We're living like skeletons

We-, liv-, li-, sk-, ....

We're living like skeletons
We're living like skeletons
We're living like skeletons
Feeling like skeletons
We're living like skeletons
Feeling like skeletons
Living like skeletons
