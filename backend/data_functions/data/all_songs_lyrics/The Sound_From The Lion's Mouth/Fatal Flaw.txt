Fatal Flaw Lyrics
A fatal attraction
Been growing away from the light
And I can't come back now
Until I drag myself out of this vice
Sense of distance when you stand next to me
I've made a strange disappearance
One that no-one can see

You can't reach me anymore
Turn to face the fatal flaw

We all have weakness
Moments that we can't contain
Right now I'm all weakness
I'll make another retreat again
Sense of distance when you stand close to me
I've a strange disappearance
One that no-one can see

You can't reach me anymore
Turn to face the fatal flaw
A fatal attraction (fatal flaw)
Been growing away from the light (fatal flaw)
A fatal attraction (fatal flaw)
Been growing away from the light (fatal flaw)
A fatal attraction (fatal flaw)
Been growing away from the light, away from the lightEmbed
