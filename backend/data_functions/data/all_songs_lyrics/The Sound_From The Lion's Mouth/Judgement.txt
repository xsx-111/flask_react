Judgement Lyrics
I can't tell, it's now or never
If we don't act now it could be now and forever
The moment is near, the moment of truth
But just what scared the life out of you?
You're so still you're silent motionless
I can't watch and wait
Just to pay the price of your judgement

I will push, at the powers that be
I will pull you close to me
And if I fall, I go gracefully
No regrets, don't pour your pity on me
You're so still, are you so lame?
I can't watch and wait
Just to take the blame for your judgement

Can there really be, someone up above me
Who judges me when my time is up
I can't believe, I can't believe
That I'm not the one that I should trust
He's so still, silent, motionless
I can't watch and wait
Just to pay the price
He's so still, he's silent, motionless
I can't watch and wait
Just to pay the price of his judgementEmbed
