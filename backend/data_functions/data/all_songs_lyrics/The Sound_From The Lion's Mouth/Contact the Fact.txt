Contact the Fact Lyrics
You mean the world, the real world to me
So watching you go, is like watching a film in slow motion
Everything I touch, turns to dust
And everyone I turn to, turns on me

Strange the way, we accept our lot (living together)
Strange the way, we self-destruct (dying together)
All the beauty gets taken for granted
All the pain gets put in the way
Put in our way

Contact's the fact, I need it
Contact you because I need you
Contact's the fact, I need it
Contact you because I need you

Take me out, you take me out of myself
You can take what you want from me
Because I know you, hate it when I'm crazy
It's a side of love, you never wanted to see

Contact's the fact, I need it
Contact you because I need you
Contact's the fact, I need it
Contact you because I need you

Contact's the fact, I need it
Contact you because I need you
Contact's the fact, I need it
Contact you because I need you

Contact, (contact's the fact)
Contact you
Contact, (contact you)
Contact you
Make contact, (contact's the fact)
Contact you
Make contact, (contact you)
Contact you
Contact, (contact's the fact)
Contact youEmbed
