The Fire Lyrics
Fell into the fire
Fell into the fire
I was led by the heart
Led by the heart
Drawn towards the heat
Drawn towards the heat
Too fierce to contain
Too fierce to contain

I'm a willing victim of circumstance
I'm a willing victim of circumstance
I can't change a thing
I can't take the chance
I can't change a thing
I can't take the chance

Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fell into the fire
Fell into the fire
I was led by the heart
Led by the heart
Drawn towards the heat
Drawn towards the heat
Too fierce to contain
Too fierce to contain

Fire!
Fire!
Fire!1Embed
