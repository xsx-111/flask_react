Winning Lyrics
What holds your hope together
Make sure it's strong enough
When you reach the end of your tether
It's because it wasn't strong enough

I was gonna drown
Then I started swimming
I was going down
Then I started winning, winning
Winning
Winning

When you're on the bottom
Crawl back to the top
Something pulls you up
And a voice says you can't stop
It won't let you stop

I was gonna drown
Then I started swimming
I was going down
But now I started winning, winning
Winning
Winning
Winning
I'm winning
Winning
I'm winning2Embed
