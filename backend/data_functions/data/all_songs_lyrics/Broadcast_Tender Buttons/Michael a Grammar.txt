Michael a Grammar Lyrics
Michael, Michael, Michael
Wake up, we're going back to Chelmsley Wood
Michael, Michael, Michael
My feet are dancing, can you see them?

Michael, Michael, Michael
I'll change my hair but inside I'll stay the same
Michael, Michael, Michael
I'll draw my lips around my lipstick

My feet are dancing so much and I hate that
My feet are dancing so much
See, if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that chance then let go
Let go, let go

Michael, Michael, Michael
Come on, your father was a teddy boy
Michael, Michael, Michael
There's nothing written on your fingernails

Michael, Michael, Michael
You said, "Remind me not to be myself"
Michael, Michael, Michael
This is not your sawtooth wave
See, if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that chance then let go
Let go, let go
My feet are dancing so much and I hate that
My feet are dancing so much

My feet are dancing so much and I hate that
My feet are dancing so much
See, if you're feeling like you're looking for a chance to let go
And if you're feeling like you're looking for that chance then let go
Let go, let go

Michael, Michael, Michael
Today the old height rise is coming down
Michael, Michael, Michael
This is not your sawtooth wave2Embed
