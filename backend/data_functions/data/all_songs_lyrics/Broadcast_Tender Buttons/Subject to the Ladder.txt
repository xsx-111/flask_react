Subject to the Ladder Lyrics
I'm not Pygmalion, hooked by failure
Ruled as a juvenile, aged as an infantile
Subject to the ladder

Ruined by affection, excepted by exception
Predicted on a graph, cornered by ritual
Diminished by impression, cried out in the lesson
Subject to the ladder, subject to the ladder

My thoughts are coming through
Emptiness follows too
A cyclone full of feeling
The silence of the room

Defended by defendants, corrected by the pain
Inspected by a sadness, exhausted by a game
Subject to the ladder, subject to the ladder

My thoughts are coming through
Emptiness follows too
A cyclone full of feeling
The silence of the room
A picture turning over, jewel in the water
Where echo saw reflection, not what it taught her
Invaded by the quarrel and I denied the lathe
Let me chop down the laurel, a goal I won't escape

I'm bullied by deception but when the whistle came
Esteem had broke infection, my torment fraught with shame
Subject to the ladder, subject to the ladder

My thoughts are coming through
Emptiness follows too
A cyclone full of feeling
The silence of the room
