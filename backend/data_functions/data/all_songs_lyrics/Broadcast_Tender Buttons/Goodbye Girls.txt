Goodbye Girls Lyrics
Endless night
Laced with time
Under unreal light
With the goodbye girls
Pendant heart
Counterpart
Under unreal light
With the goodbye girls

Fraudulently
They love you
I think of you
You're in a sleepless dream
The insincere

Vacantly they listen
Giving no emotion
Leaving no impression
Love you all night
Love you all night

Honesty
Sweet deceit
You're in a cut up world
With the goodbye girls
Love distilled
For your guilt
Feelings superimposed
On the goodbye girls

Fraudulently
They love you
I think of you

Vacantly they listen
Giving no emotion
Leaving no impression
Love you all night
Vacantly they listen
Giving no emotion
Leaving no impression
Love you all night
Love you all night
Love you all night
Love you all nightEmbed
