Arc of a Journey Lyrics
Clouds float away like iron tools on the moon
All my time is in half-life
Memories over memories
Can I see more than I'm programmed to be?

Constellation of Orion
A picture with a past
A future so vast
A mnemonic game
On the arc of a journey

I report there once were cities
Open academies
Avenues and trees
Human law
Automatic oracles
Calendar, the years
Verbal hemispheres

Constellation of Orion
The repositioned light
The postatomic night
Informing me I'm near
The axis of feeling
Constellation of Orion
A picture with a past
A future so vast
A mnemonic game
On the arc of a journeyEmbed
