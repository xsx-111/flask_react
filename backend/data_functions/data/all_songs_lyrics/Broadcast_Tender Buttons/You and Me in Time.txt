You and Me in Time Lyrics
You and me in time
You and me in time

The river flows down
The flower grows up
The snow makes no sound
On the mountain top

You and me in time
You and me in time

We're saying goodbye
We're waving our hands
The waves and the tide
Move the grains of sand

You and me in timeEmbed
