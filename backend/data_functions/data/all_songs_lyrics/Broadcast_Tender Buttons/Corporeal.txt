Corporeal Lyrics
Under the white chalk, drawn on the blackboard
Under the x-ray, I'm just a vertebrate

Do that to me
Do that to my anatomy
Do that to me
Do that to my anatomy
Corporeal, corporeal

We are mankind, we are manikin
With and without mind, with or without Darwin

Classify me, the strings of my autonomy
Classify me, the strings of my autonomy
Corporeal, corporeal

A thorny red heart around a thin arm
Inside a white bone, the love is inborn

Close up to me, up close to my anatomy
Close up to me, up close to my autonomy
Corporeal, corporeal
Corporeal, corporeal
