Black Cat Lyrics
Sapphire, her burning eyes
Model euphonic paradigms

Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love

The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser

Shadowing masonic verve
Follows the pharaoh and the worm

Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love

The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Look at me)
Into the purring night you call (Once different)

Awkwardness happening to someone you love
Awkwardness happening to someone you love

The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser
The black cat, the black cat
Curiouser and curiouser

Awkwardness happening (Once different)
Awkwardness happening (Look at me, look at me)2Embed
