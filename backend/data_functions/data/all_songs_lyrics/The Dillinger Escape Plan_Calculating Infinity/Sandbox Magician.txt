Sandbox Magician LyricsNow who's the fool?
Strip it off, and scale the wall
I am the mask that talks, inside the concrete flesh
I am the king, now tell me nothing
I am the fool for a day
Concrete playground, hides the valley
Make me the king, so I can strip it off
Who is the fool today?
Friend?
A new idea from your stagnant mind
And you must always fall before the clown
I can beat you (I can beat you)
I can cheat you (I can cheat you)
Can I be you?Embed
