Clip the Apex... Accept Instruction LyricsThat lashed right on the head of the nail
A thousand years
It was the last moment
Figured it out
How the honey burns
Figured it out
Stick on me so sweet
Decoy this crap
Hide this broken boy
Decoy your crap
Fuck you cause I've rotted
Figured it out
How the honey burns
Figured it out
Stick on me so sweet
Figured it out
Figured it out
I've broken down
I'm that kid
So naive
Bet it all
I
Just lost
The whole thing
Just lost
It all
Figured it out
Figured it out
Sing us plenty
Cover me baby
Red for money
Proves it's phony
Red for money
Proves it's phony
So step right up
You won that prize
I've rotted
I lost the house
I bet it all
I've lost the whole thing
Bet the whole thingEmbed
