The Running Board LyricsSoft, soft fade
Circled around
Turn loose goodbye
Switch off
Turn loose
Switch off
Switch off
Goodbye
No attempt to look failure is king
Are we ready
Close those lips
Try to lose me 3 more time
Hush baby, now don't say a word
6:53 and where are you?
Run home, run far
Throw your face in a pillow
Scream out what you can't
6:53 and where are you?
Run home, run far
Throw your face in a pillow
Scream out what you can't
Fix that makeup cover your tracks
Yeah you're an angel
Avoiding what games, games to play
Was it "less or more or more or less"
Coward
Wisk away the fear
Clear the air
Clear the air and slide
Closer to the edge
Say goodnight
Final curtain call
Switch off, goodbyeEmbed
