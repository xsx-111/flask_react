I smell that whore
Bring me back
Bring me a brick

Take my bottle
And break it
Pour it all out
I pushed you too far
Take my bottle
And break it

Self absorb that pity
I just want to knock you off your horse

I just feel it
Everything's fine
Spit on yourself
You're so beautiful
Spit on yourself
So beautiful
Crack and chip off
Like the sun won't
Shine
Down
Take your medicine like a champ
While that sting can last a million years
Self absorb that utopia
So bad
I just feel it

I just feel it
Everything's fine
Spit on yourself
Like the sun won't
Shine
Down
