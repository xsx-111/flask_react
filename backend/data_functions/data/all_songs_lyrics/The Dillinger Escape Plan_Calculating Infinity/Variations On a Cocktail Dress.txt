Variations On a Cocktail Dress LyricsFill holes
Dig holes
Forever
Gazing at backdoors
For once in a life
It's coming in
Inspired by our attraction
What we smell
Bitter sweet pleasure
What we smell
Bitter sweet pleasure
One phone call
One fine line of prison
One phone call
One fine line of prison
The walk
The smell
The spoiled
Backdoor honey
Please come home
Such a shame to throw away
Don't you fucking spill it
Avoid that the best feeling possible
(yes we do obsess)1Embed
