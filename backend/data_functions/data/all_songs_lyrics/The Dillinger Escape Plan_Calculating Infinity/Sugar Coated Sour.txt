Sugar Coated Sour LyricsWhat rounding out breaks the silent barrier
Waiting, wait, wait
Can I pick your modest waste?
I expect no more than (did I stutter? did I stutter? did I stutter?)
A simple regret
You deserved it, and you earned it
Take a bow, you deserve it
Eat shit, you earned it
Life would be so much better
If you did not exist
Take a bow, you deserve it
Eat shit, you earned it
Life would be so much better
And god bless you fucking queen
And god bless you fucking queen
So now you've started
What pawns we have become
In this bland little play
What pawns we have become
In this bland little play
Sugar. Coated. SourEmbed
