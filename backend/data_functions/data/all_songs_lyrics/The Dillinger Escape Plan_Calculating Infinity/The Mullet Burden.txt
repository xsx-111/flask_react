The Mullet Burden LyricsSuch worthless crust and crazed
Now cring to slap the wrist, I sense you cracked and weak
The nonexistent won't care
When you fail to wake, I sense you cracked and weak
I wonder if you would
I wonder if you could
Please just a small taste
Of the offer unrefused
Bonded by a muddy crippled story
And now I wonder if you really ever could
I wonder if you could
I wonder if you would
You're no good
Self-sodomize once more
Whore, slut, et fragile and tight
A reckless mangled conscience
With only the imbalance of evils
Wait for guidance, end it all nowEmbed
