Moonlight in Vermont LyricsPennies in a stream
Falling leaves
A sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont
I see fingers wave
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont
Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And they travel each bend in the road
People who meet, in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont
Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet, in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...
Evening summer breeze
Warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont
You and I
And moonlight in VermontEmbed
