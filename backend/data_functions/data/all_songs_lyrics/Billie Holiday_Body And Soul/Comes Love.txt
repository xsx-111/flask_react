Comes Love LyricsComes a rainstorm, get your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow-storm, you can get a little heat
Comes love, nothing can be done
Comes a fire, then you know just what to do
Blow a tire, you can buy another sure
Comes love, nothing can be done
Don't try hiding cause there isn't any use
You start sliding when your heart turns on the juice
Comes a headache, you can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache, see your dentist right away
Comes love, nothing can be done
Comes a heat-wave, you can hurry to the shore
Comes the summer, you can hide behind the door
Comes love, nothing can be done
Comes the measles, you can quarrantine the room
Comes a mousy, you can chase it with the broom
Comes love, nothing can be done
That's all brother, if you've ever been in love
That's all, brother, you know what I'm speaking of
Comes a nightmare, you can always stay awake
Comes depression, you may get another break
Comes love, nothing can be doneEmbed
