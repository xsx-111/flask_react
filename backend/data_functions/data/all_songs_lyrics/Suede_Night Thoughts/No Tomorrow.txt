No Tomorrow Lyrics
How long will it take to mend?
How long will it take? It depends
How long will I blow my money on
Parade and paperbacks?

Another moment to make me wonder
Another sentence to help me through

Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Like there’s no tomorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Come, there’s no tomorrow

How long will I shun the race
And sit around in my denim shirts?
A cadaver in tracksuit trousers
Connect me to missing persons
How long will it take to break
The plans that I never make?
Too long have I sat outside and smoked
I know all the neighbors' cars
Another moment to make me wonder
Another sentence to help me through

Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Like there’s no tomorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Come, there’s no tomorrow

Another moment to make me wonder
Another sentence to help me through

Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Like there’s no tomorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Fight the sorrow
Come, there’s no tomorrow
Come, there’s no tomorrow Embed
