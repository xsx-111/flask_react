Like Kids Lyrics
Oh, through the red lights, the amber
The silent mannequins
The crumpled mothers in their seats
Pull into morning through the stations
The smell of chemicals
Do I want you because you are out of reach?

Oh, it’s all there for us
Oh, it belongs to us
Oh, and there is nothing we can’t reach
Oh, we hold it all in our fist
Like kids, like savages
And we’ll run in the playground
If you’ll just stay with me

Oh, through the red lights, the amber
I steal a look at you
Behind the wheel of another car
Oh, nothing matters
But this moment
I conjure the imagery
Of a different life, another path
Oh, it’s all there for us
Oh, it belongs to us
Oh, and there is nothing we can’t reach
Oh, we hold it all in our fist
Like kids, like savages
And we’ll run in the playground
If you’ll just stay with meEmbed
