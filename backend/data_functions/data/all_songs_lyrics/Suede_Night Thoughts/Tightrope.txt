Tightrope Lyrics
You seem to love me when I’m not around
When I have to go to ground
You just seem to want me when I’m never there
Silence is everywhere

On a tightrope with you
Too scared to look down through my fingers
Walking a tightrope with you
I made my mistake when I slipped through the noose

You seem to know where your life’s headed next
But first you'll just stay in bed
Clicking your fingers and dragging your heels
The high life is within you

On a tightrope with you
Too scared to look down through my fingers
Walking a tightrope with you
I made my mistake when I slipped through the noose

We know more than we used to
We know more than we used to
On a tightrope with you
Too scared to look down through my fingers
Walking a tightrope with you
I made my mistake when I slipped through the noose

You seem to love me when I am not around
When I have to go to ground
But you seem to want me when I am never there
Silence is everywhereEmbed
