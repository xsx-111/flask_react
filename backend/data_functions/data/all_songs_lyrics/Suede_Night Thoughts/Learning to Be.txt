Learning to Be Lyrics
Every word
That I’ve ever said
Is empty as air
Like gossamer thread
I come tumbling out
Of a single bed
To be with you again

And isn’t it strange
That the method I choose
Is a way to get close
But I get further from you?
I try to step away
But I am too scared to move
Like I’m in love again

And when it’s over
We go down to the streets
Feeling like models
Learning to be

Falling like leaves
Falling like leaves
Falling like leaves
Falling like leavesEmbed
