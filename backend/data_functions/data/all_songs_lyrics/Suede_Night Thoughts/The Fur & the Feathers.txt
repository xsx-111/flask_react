The Fur & the Feathers Lyrics
On the platform you are waiting
Your arms are bare
There’s a warning in your eyes
And the cold earth waits for me there
As I hurry past the railings
You brush your dress
And with the mourning in your eyes
And that look of hungriness

And who knows what we’ve begun
We are thrown together
From the moment we are young
The fur and the feathers, the fox and the geese
The thrill of the chase
It’s the thrill of the chase

And I know that there’s a meaning
Beyond the flesh
Well, I’ve found some different feeling
In the grip of your caress
On the platform you are waiting
And my breathing stops
I’m so scared of touching you
But I’m scared to not
And who knows what we’ve begun
We are thrown together
And who knows what we’ll become
The fur and the feathers, the fox and the geese
The thrill of the chase
It’s the thrill of the chase

And who knows what we’ll become
As we brave the weather
From the moment we are young
The fur and the feathers, the fox and the geese
The thrill of the chase
It’s the thrill of the chaseEmbed
