This Business Is Killing Me Lyrics
I'm sick to death
A nervous wreck
This business is killing me, you know
This business is killing me, You know
It's really killing me, yeah
I'm sick to death
A nervous wreck
This business is killing me, you know
This business is killing me, you know
It's really killing me, yeah

Oh no, oh no, oh no, Oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no ho
This business is killing me
And so they say

Run around, run around
Love giving you the runaround
It really makes you crazy
Run around, run around
Love giving you the runaround
Oh no, oh no, oh no, Oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no ho
This business is killing me
And so they say
Hey, hey

You work, you work
You write all night
Until the early morning light
Can't please all the people all the time
All the people all the time
But then they don't please me
Well, I can't take it no more
No, I can't take it no more
Run around, run around
Love giving you the runaround
It really makes you crazy
Run around, run around
Love giving you the runaround
Oh no, oh no, oh no, Oh no
Oh no, oh no
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh no ho
This business is killing me
And so they say
Hey, hey
You work, you work
You write all night
Until the early morning light
Can't please all the people all the time
All the people all the time
But then they don't please me

Well, I can't take it no more
No, I can't take itEmbed
