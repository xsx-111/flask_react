The KKK Took My Baby Away LyricsShe went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
Now I don't know
Where my baby can be
They took her from me
They took her from me
I don't know where my baby can be
They took her from me
They took her from me
Ring me, ring me, ring me
Up the President
And find out where my baby went
Ring me, ring me, ring me
Up the FBI
And find out if
My baby's alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
She went away for the holidays
Said she's going to L.A
But she never got there
She never got there
She never got there, they say
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
The KKK took my baby away
They took her away
Away from me
The KKK took my baby away
They took my girl
They took my baby away1Embed
