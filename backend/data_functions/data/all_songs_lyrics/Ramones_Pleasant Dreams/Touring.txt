Touring Lyrics
Well, we've been to London, we've been to L.A
Spain, New Zealand, and the U.S.A
Europe, Japan, and Pango-Pango
Canada, Siam, Oz and Komodo
The kids all come from miles around
The party gets started when the sun goes down
A Holiday Inn's the only home I know, I know, I know, I know
Rock and roll's alive because we got the power, baby
Cruising down the highway at five hundred miles an hour, baby
We got a fuel-injected tour bus, man, it really flies
With a video tape deck inside

Let's go, rock and roll, everybody come on
Let's go, rock and roll, everybody come on now

Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring
Oh baby, touring
Especially with your favorite girl
Touring, touring, all around the world
Well, we've been around this great big world
And we've met all kinds of guys and girls
From Komodo Island to Rockaway Beach
No, it's not hard, not far to reach
American girls knock me out, ya know
Fast cars, cold beer, and rock and roll
America is the only home I know, I know, I know, I know

Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Five hundred miles to Mexico
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Two hundred miles to Tokyo
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Drive, drive, drive the night away
Straight on through to the break of day
Drive, drive, drive the night away
Well, it's in your blood, it's in your blood

Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring, is never boring
Touring, touring
Oh baby, touring
Especially with your favorite girl
Now, Touring, touring, all around the worldEmbed
