Sitting in My Room Lyrics
Sitting in my room
Record player on
Sitting in my room
Humming a sickening tune
Sitting in my room
Something to do soon
We know what we think of them
The problems just keep piling in
They got complains about everything
It is us against them
It is us against them
It is us against them
They just want to worry
That is not what any kid
Should have to do
They just want to be so lame
Maybe they should
Try and sniff some glueEmbed
