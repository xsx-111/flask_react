Lilies of the Valley Lyrics
Momma she had complications
There's nothing very strange about that
Nuns said "We can't kill that baby
We'll have to let your mother die"

We are all just lilies of the valley
We neither reap nor sow
We need to get our hands a little dirty
To make our gardens grow, hey hey

Way too many people on this island
Getting way too crowded on this boat
Need someone to bail some water
If we're gonna keep this thing afloat

I like a little sugar in my coffee
I don't mean Sweet 'n' Low
You don't know what you want until you find it
I believe you'll tell me so, hey hey

I need a little water in my garden
I need a little sunlight on my head
I need someone to cover me with kisses
When I'm all alone and scared
Oh and we are all just lilies of the valley
We neither reap nor sow
We need to get our hands a little dirty
To make our gardens grow

Hey, I like a little sugar in my coffee
I don't mean Sweet 'n' Low
I - like to cover me with kisses
To make my garden grow, hey heyEmbed
