A Long Time Ago LyricsAnd in the land where I grew up
Into the bosom of technology
I kept my feelings to myself
Until the perfect moment comes
Then into your bloodstream I will go
Until I turn into a part of you
Flooding the garden of delights
That was a long long time ago
That was a long long time ago
It's not the ending of the world
It's only the closing of a discotheque
I used to go three times a week
But that was a long long time ago
Yeah, that was a long long time ago
And that roaring that you hear
Is only the blood that circles constantly
No it is not applause my dear
No, that was a long long time ago
That was a long long time ago
Ooh, oh ooh
Ooh, oh ooh
In between stations I can hear
A million possibilities
It's only the singing of the stars
That burned out a long long time ago
They burned out a long long time ago
Ooh, oh ooh
Ooh, oh oohEmbed
