Buck Naked LyricsRunnin' naked, down the state highway
Runnin' naked, in the middle of the day
Runnin' naked like a tom cat's behind
Runnin' naked but the cat don't seem to mind
Give me your heart
I'll give you mine first
Give me your time
And I'll give you my trust
And we're buck naked now
Like when we were born
When will we find out?
And why does it take so long?
And we're buck naked now
And we're buck naked now
And we're buck naked now
In the eyes of the Lord
Runnin' naked like the day when I was born
We're all naked in the land where I come from
I'm a long long way from New York City now
We're all naked - if you turn us inside out
And we're buck naked now
We ain't got no clothes
Bare assed for sure
In the eyes of God
Naked in my heart
Naked in my soul
Well, how, how does it feel?
Does anybody know?
Well we're naked inside
You're naked too
Well there's nothing to fear
And there's nothing we can do
Well we're buck naked now
Buck naked now
Well we're buck naked now
In the eyes of the LordEmbed
