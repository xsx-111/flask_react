My Love Is You LyricsSome men desire a princess
And others lust for a temptress
Well I don't need one of those
'cause, my love is you
My love is you
Some men replace their mamas
And some want a young baiana
I have no use for those
'cause, my love is you
My love is you
Sometimes dear
You tell me I'm an asshole
Sometimes you're an asshole too
Even though we're filled with imperfections
I don't think any less of you
I'm primitive and selfish
I'm childlike and I'm helpless
Well I got that way because of
My love for you
My love is you
My love is youEmbed
