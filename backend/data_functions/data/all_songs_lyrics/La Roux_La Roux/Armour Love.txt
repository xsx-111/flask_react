Armour Love Lyrics
You pull on your armour
You put up defences
Why do you want to?
Because I'm here to protect you
So take it easy
I'll make it so easy
You can lay your head down
And we'll leave it 'til tomorrow

You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
When you leave me alone in this world you know that I'm in hell
Do you know what it's like to be lonely and by yourself?

When your life is tangled
You wear your disguises
But why do you need to
When I'm standing here beside you?
So take it easy
I make it so easy
You can lay your head down
And we'll leave it 'til tomorrow

You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
When you leave me alone in this world you know that I'm in hell
Do you know what it's like to be lonely and by yourself?
Slipping through my fingers and into another's
Tell me why won't you turn back?

You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
(You know what it's like, you shouldn't have to be told)
When you leave me alone in this world you know that I'm in hell
(It's hard enough when you're alone in the world)
Do you know what it's like to be lonely and by yourself?
You seem to believe you belong to somebody else
(You know what it's like, you shouldn't have to be told)
When you leave me alone in this world you know that I'm in hell
(It's hard enough when you're alone in the world)
Do you know what it's like to be lonely and by yourself?Embed
