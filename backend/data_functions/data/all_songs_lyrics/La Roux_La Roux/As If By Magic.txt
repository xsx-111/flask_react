As If By Magic Lyrics
Emerging from my world
Imagine living in a box
And I won't come out
Until I've broken all the locks
Slurring all my words
Until something sticks
But in this smoky universe
My mind keeps playing tricks

And although you're the only home I know
As if by magic thoughts of you are gone
And now I'm keeping my head in the clouds
And it's not so tragic if I don't look down

Submerging from your world
And back into my bliss
A day rolled into one
Is burning on my lips
Blurring all your words
Until they don't exist
And in a parallel universe
It's me you can't resist
(x2)
And although you're the only home I'll ever know
As if by magic thoughts of you are gone
And now I'm keeping my head in the clouds
And it's not so tragic if I don't look down
(You say I'm a rose tinted lover come on)
(You know I'll never love another)
(I won't stay a lonely for long)3Embed
