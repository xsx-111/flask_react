Fascination Lyrics
It's been seven hours long
And your shadow still hangs on
You've been two weeks gone
And so tonight I followed you home

There are so many different ways
Of collecting all the strays
The ones that get away

Old fascinations, we crave new sensations
Old fascination, it's feeding my frustrations
It's feeding my frustrations
And I haven't got the patience

These sheets are still warm
This bed is our only home
We make arrangements over the phone
Where has all the conversation gone?

There are so many different ways
Of collecting all the strays
The ones that get away
Old fascinations, we crave new sensations
Old fascination, it's feeding my frustrations
It's feeding my frustrations
And I haven't got the patience

Frustrations, sensations
Fascinations, fascinations
Frustrations, sensations
Fascinations, fascinations

Old fascinations, new sensations
Old fascinations, new sensations
Old fascinations, we crave new sensations
Old fascinations, it's feeding my frustrationsEmbed
