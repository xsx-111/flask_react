Colourless Colour Lyrics
You say it's coming, but I can't see it at all
You know me well, but I don't know you at all
No, I don't know you at all
It's always just on the horizon so my hopes rise and fall
You know me well, but I don't know you at all
No, I don't know you at all

Early '90s décor, it was a day for
We wanted to play, but we had nothing left to play for
Colourless colour
Once in fashion, soon to be seen
Early '90s décor, it was a day for
We wanted to play, but we had nothing left to play for
Colourless colour
Once in fashion, soon to be seen

Been dreaming of blue skies, new horizons
And sights from my eyes
The discovery of the unknown
Is something to tell the folks back home
I want to get away, to feel the sun on my skin
To feel it really sinking in
Early '90s décor, it was a day for
We wanted to play, but we had nothing left to play for
Colourless colour
Once in fashion, soon to be seen
Early '90s décor, it was a day for
We wanted to play, but we had nothing left to play for
Colourless colour
Once in fashion, soon to be seen


Early '90s décor, it was a day for
We wanted to play, but we had nothing left to play for
Colourless colour
Once in fashion, soon to be seen
Early '90s décor, it was a day for
We wanted to play, but we had nothing left to play for
Colourless colour
Once in fashion, soon to be rediscoveredEmbed
