Tigerlily Lyrics
Well tonight out on the streets I'm gonna follow you
And tell you all about a scene that you would kill for
You're gonna love what's burning right in front of you
But you won't see it by the light of the sun
Come out, Tigerlily, you're caressing me
I'll take you up, I'll turn you on, I'll take your apathy
I wouldn't lie to you, blossom, won't you let it go?
I'm gonna give you what you want, and don't you know?

That you
I know you better than this
I could be here when you call
I'll make you top of the list
And in the crush of the dark
I'll be your light in the mist
I can see you burning with desire for a kiss
Psychobabble all upon your lips

Well, they can sell it all they want, but you cannot agree
I don't like the taste of damn morality
You'll find your bread and your butter where you fake it
And put your face in the gutter of a snake pit
But our communication is telepathy
What you give is what you get out of us naturally
And we can wait till the shadow grows long
And turn the page of the story that has long since found a home
I know you better than this
I could be here when you call
I'll make you top of the list
And in the crush of the dark
I'll be your light in the mist
I can see you burning with desire for a kiss
Psychobabble all upon your lips

Have you ever felt like you're being followed?
Or watched the ones that held your stare?
Turned around to see who's behind you
To find there's no one there?
Lurking in the dark
'Cause someone breathes you night and day
There's a friend who wants so much more
And if they can't have you, they'll never let you walk away

And in the crush of the dark
I'll be your light in the mist
I can see you burning with desire for a kiss
Psychobabble all upon your lips
And in the crush of the dark
I'll be your light in the mist
I can see you burning with desire for a kiss
Psychobabble all upon your lips2Embed
