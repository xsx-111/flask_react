Reflections Are Protections Lyrics
Please, please be my light filter
Shine, make me a shelter to hide
Cause love makes you lose your sight
Now the search party's on its way
And the flood lights on my face
All the shadows that I walk in
Are just my volatile second skin

My reflections are protections
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
When you're ready come into the light

Lines, design a pathway
Shine, cut out the dark shapes
To find, although I really tried
Only time is a lover's guide
And now the railings fall away
And the stencils draw a face
Our outlines in the sunset
Are just a fragile silhouette

My reflections are protections
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
When you're ready come into the light
My reflections are protections
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
If you leave me, I'll go back to hide

My reflections are protections
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
When you're ready come into the light
My reflections are protections
They will keep me from destruction
My directions are distractions
If you leave me, I'll go back to hideEmbed
