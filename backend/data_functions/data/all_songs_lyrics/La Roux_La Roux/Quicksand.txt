Quicksand Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm the upsetter, holding your hand
It seems you have forgotten about your man
Alone in the darkness, my bed's a different land
Your touch intensifies and I'm in the quicksand

I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand

You're the upsetter, stroking my hand
What's my position? I don't understand
Am I your possession, am I in demand?
Oh, when you turn to me I'm in the quicksand

I'm in the quicksand
I'm in the quicksand

You, you moved into my mind again, oh
You walking around rent-free, oh
Oh, I could let you stay
But I'm walking on broken ground again
Oh, oh, when will I learn?
All you do is push me back in the dark
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, oh-oh

I'm in the quicksand (Ooh, ooh)
I'm in the quicksand (Ooh, ooh)
I'm in the quicksand (Ooh, ooh)
I'm in the quicksand (Ooh, ooh)
I'm in the quicksandEmbed
