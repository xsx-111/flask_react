Finally My Saviour Lyrics
In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here

I hear you call me from the other room
You say my name as if you know what you're about to do
You say you're tired and you must be leaving soon
When will we ever see this through?
And I continue to drown my sorrows
After you're gone
And look around for somebody else to
Hang my hopes on

In fact it's easier now that
You're not here
I'm no longer dreading you
Muttering those words in my ear

In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here

I can't explain the dark expression on my face
To the people that I'm surrounded by
But you understand me more than most
And you let me try
In fact it's easy now
In fact it's easy now
In fact it's easy now
In fact it's easy now
I'm no longer dreading you
Muttering those words in my ear

In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is here
In my ear, finally my saviour is hereEmbed
