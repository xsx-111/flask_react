Cover My Eyes Lyrics
No wonder I'm scared to look in your eyes
You've turned me away so many times
You can take it away at any given moment
It's hard to believe while you're in this disguise

So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
I'm just surviving
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
Stop me from crying

When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
Every time you leave with her
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)

No wonder it hurts to sit by your side
(Turned me away so many times)
There's a different song I can play you tonight
(We don't have to sit here in silence)
We can break the pattern, we can change the colour
(It's just a little sacrifice)
You don't need to worry about the others
(It's all in your mind)
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
I'm just surviving
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
Stop me from crying
(x2)
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
Every time you leave with her
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
Something inside me dies
(x2)
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
Every time you leave with her
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)
Something inside me diesEmbed
