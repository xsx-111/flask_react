Latest Monkey LyricsThe newest clown
Cries an old type of tears
Watch them fall
There they lie
Crispy, ancient and they leak
Formaldahyde
Going
Going I'm gone
Go away
Going
His tears they sit
Crusty, rusted in a box
Inside a drawer
Grandpa's news
Fragile words are yellowed through
Forever more
Going
Going I'm gone
Go away
Going
Sadder than sad
She's feeling bad
Monkey's the one who laughs last
Hold me down
Cut me loose when
Nighttime falls
And lifts away
I'm a ball
Bouncing off of a brick wall
Into the day
I'm Going
Going I'm gone
Go away
Going I'm gone
Gone
I am gone I am gone
Go away
GoingEmbed
