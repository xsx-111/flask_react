Late at Night LyricsI close my door at night
But they get in all right
And she turns on the light
I held her hands so tight
'cause words don't come out right
And she sees things at night
Me, i'm closer to the door
I don't get scared no more
But i don't know the score
If i could hold them in my hand
I'd make them understand
I'm not a haunted mind
I'm not a thoughtless kind
If i could put them in a jar
I know they wouldn't scar
I'd do it if i could
I hope you know i would
I close my door at night
But she gets in all right
So i turn on the light
I held her hand too tight
Too hard to make it right
So i could sleep at night
If i could hold them in my hand
I'd make them understand
I'm not a haunted mind
I'm not a thoughtless kind
If i could put them in a jar
I know they wouldn't scar
I'd do it if i could
I hope you know i would
I'd do it if i could
I hope you know i would
I'd do it if i could
I hope you know i would
I'd do it if i could
I hope you know i would
I'd do it if i could
I hope you know i wouldEmbed
