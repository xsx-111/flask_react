My Responsibility LyricsI don't think you care - no, no, no
And I don't like the way you stare
I don't like that joke - no, no, no
And I don't wanna smell like smoke
I don't like that face - no, no, no
And I don't wanna walk your pace
But I don't like that cold
Far away look I'm told
But I don't think you'll find
Where you have lost your mind
But I don't think you know - oh
How much I loved to scold you
I can't make this change - no, no, no
It's you that I have to blame
Suppose I can't find your bones
Under this broken home
But I don't think you'll find
Where you have lost your mind
And I don't think you know - oh
How much I loved to hold you
But do you remember me
You're my responsibility
Much more than a host - oh
Much more than a friendly ghost
Do remember me
You're my responsibility
Much more than a host - oh
More than a friendly ghost
Do you remember me
You're my responsibility
Much more than a host - oh
More than a friendly ghostEmbed
