Anything That Way LyricsThe moon was full your whisky sour
Oh girl there's no need to be so dour
Cause when you walk with me in the beginning of the day
You see, I don't need anything that way
I'm wishing things could be the same
When things got broken you came
My moods were always changing they were blue then brown then grey
You see, I don't need anything that way
You see, I don't need anything that way
I'm fighting tooth and nail
Against these demons in my head
And no matter where I'm sleeping
My history's right there in bed
When things blew open you flew in
And I was caught red-handed once again
Was I really robbing you of the best days of your life?
I'm sorry I never meant anything that way
The mailman came this way today
He said "No sir, I've got nothing for you today"
Went outside in the morning time but I got lost along the way
You see, I don't need anything that way
No no I don't need anything that way
Oh no I don't need anything that way
I don't need anything that way, that way
I don't need anything that wayEmbed
