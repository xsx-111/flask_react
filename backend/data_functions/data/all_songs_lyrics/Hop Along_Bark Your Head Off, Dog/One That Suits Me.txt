One That Suits Me LyricsMeanwhile the scientist, pounding on his skull, his skull
Two blew themselves away working on it
In storms the general grabbed him by his collar, his collar
"Well you old crackpot, what have you got to say?"
In an open field, man is guilty always
In an open field, man is guilty always
Mud is yellow and the ground is moving
Sun is yellow and the ground is moving
The ground is moving
The century turned and your old man stumbled in
The century turned and your old man stumbled in
Saying "Of course I am for peace, of course I am for peace
One that suits me, one that suits me
One that suits me, one that does"
For the first time the captain's at my side
Look now, here the Padre comes
Here he comes
About to go on his lunchbreak
"Son you and I both know the real criminal is time
I understand your crime, your crime
But just what makes you think you've got the right to be young?"
In an open field man is guilty always
In an open field man is guilty always
Mud is yellow and the ground is moving
Sun is yellow and the ground is moving
The ground is moving
The century turned and your old man stumbled in
The century turned and your old man stumbled in saying -
"Of course I am for peace, of course I am for peace
One that suits me, one that suits me
One that suits me, one that does
One that suits me, one that suits me
One that suits me, one that suits me
One that suits me, one that suits me
One that suits"
And now the mother of them all
She is just about to fall
In the history of man, reality becomes softened
And now the mother of them all
She is just about to fall
In the history of man, reality becomes softened1Embed
