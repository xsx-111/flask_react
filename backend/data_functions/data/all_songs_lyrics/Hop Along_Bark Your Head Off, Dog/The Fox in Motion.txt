The Fox in Motion LyricsThe youngest-- but that does not matter now
She and her sister laugh
I was asleep with my mouth open the whole drive down
On a sheet on the beach
Small lunatic birds
We watch them as they rush and retreat
No I wasn't changed tonight
Or it has not yet been recognized
When we saw the fox run
Just a few feet in front of us
I thought something must be wrong;
She looked like decay in motion
We saw the fox run, like a ghost
Lost and embarrassed
I thought something must be wrong
She must be sick
Cousin take me home
All the way off in the city
His distant regret
Cousin take me home
All the way off in the city
His distant regret
The youngest-- but that does not matter now
Her sister and I on opposite ends of the beach
Island after island
Go the thoughts within
Each of us off on our own in the dark scavenging
And me on my phone scavenging
Cousin take me home
All the way off in the city
His distant regret
Cousin take me home
All the way off in the city
His distant regret
How can I explain it?
Having been seen
What would that mean?
I can't explain it
Having been seen
What would that mean?
Cousin take me homeEmbed
