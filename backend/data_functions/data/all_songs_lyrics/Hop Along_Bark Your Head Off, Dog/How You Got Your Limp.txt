How You Got Your Limp LyricsPoured the professor into a cab
Avoiding as best as one can
The voice of a doomed man
Condemning his students
In my lack of power
I knew him
I can hear you
The whole bar can
The supervisor lied over the phone
He never got up to check next door
On that nineteen year old kid
Who came into work but was nonetheless re-convicted
Over the counter Nora told me all about it
I can hear you
The whole bar can
I know what you'd like me to say
But you got to do exactly what you wanted
It's how you got your limp
All your strength came from her humiliation
I can hear you
I can't do anything
Quitting the bar perfectly understood in the end
He will be leaving a garbage tip as his revengeEmbed
