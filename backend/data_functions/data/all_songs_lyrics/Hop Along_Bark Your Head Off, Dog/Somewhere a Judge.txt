Somewhere a Judge LyricsThere you have it, the beginning and the end
The intern's shovel still covered in shit
Death, indiscriminate drags off
The newborn buck with the broken leg
In the shadow of conversations had while I was asleep
Not to mention the years of conversations you've had without me
Afternoon vanilla sun crawls away across the lawn
Through the phone I pull you and drag your voice around
Afternoon vanilla sun crawls away without a sound
Through the phone I pull you and drag your voice around
You don't know I know what's wrong
Notification: 8 executions by drug to beat the expiration
A shelf life of reason, is that what this was, oh Arkansas?
Somewhere a judge stretches himself out on fine tropical sand
I went back to work then took the train home
I saw a fire in the distance
Afternoon vanilla sun crawls away across the lawn
Through the phone I pull you and drag your voice around
Afternoon vanilla sun crawls away without a sound
Through the phone I pull you and drag your voice around
I don't know why I'm so mean each time I come to visit
I don't know why I'm so mean each time I come aroundEmbed
