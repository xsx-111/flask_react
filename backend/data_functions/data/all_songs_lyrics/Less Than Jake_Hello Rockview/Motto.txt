Motto LyricsHave you ever felt that something
You know that something that keeps you sane?
And you can't explain why
But you know it's what's left inside you
And I know it's that something
You know that something that keeps me sane
And I can't explain why
But it's all I have left to hold onto
And when I say that it's everything
From my highest hopes
To my dumbest schemes
You'll never know what it means to me
I'm just a reason away
From that something that keeps me saneEmbed
