Last One Out of Liberty City Lyrics
Last one out of Liberty City
Burn it to the ground

I know, I know, I know
I know just who I am
And what's in my head
Is that I don't really give a damn
Just who you think I am
Just who I am, just who I am
Just who I
I know there comes a time
When you lose faith
In what you believe inside
What you have inside
And did you know somehow
It's just a spark that's a start
That keeps us from the crowd

The other day, this girl
Came up to me and asked
If she used to go to school with me
I kinda laughed. She said
Wasn't I the guy her friends always
Called a waste of time
I know, I know, I know
I know just who I am
And what's in my head
Is that I don't really give a damn
Just who you think I am
Just who I am, just who I am
Just who I
When I stop and think about
Where I'll be ten years from now
Ten years from now
I wonder if the me of now would
Call myself washed up or watered down
Or just part of the crowd

The other night, this guy
Came up to me downtown
And can't believe after five years
I'm still around. And he said
Wasn't I the guy who walked these streets all night
Such a waste of time

I know, I know, I know
I know just who I am
And what's in my head
Is that I don't really give a damn
Just who you think I am
Just who I am, just who I am
Just who I
Just who I am, just who I am
Just who I
Just who I am, just who I am
Just who I am
Wow!Embed
