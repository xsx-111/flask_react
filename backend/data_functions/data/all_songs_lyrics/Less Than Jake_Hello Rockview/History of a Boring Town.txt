History of a Boring Town LyricsJust talked to this girl
Used to live, yea, on my street. (woah-oh-oh)
After all these years you're here
And you remember me (woah-oh-oh)
She said her old boyfriend
Packed up and headed back east
But she always knew some day...
He would go
She just got a new job
But she doubts it will last (woah-oh-oh)
So let's take a drink and never think, yea
Here's to the past (woah-oh-oh)
She said it's so funny
How life runs out so fast
It's just another wasted day
A boring life in a boring town
With the same old crowd (woah-oh-oh)
When I used to say, that I'd never say
But I'm rotting here today (woah-oh-oh)
With that same old crowd
That's always been around
And I always thought I'd be
The first to go
That same old crowd
That drags me down
Another day in a boring town
That same old crowd
That brings me down
A boring life in a boring town
Just talked to this girl
Used to live, yea, on my street
After all these years you're here
And it's still just you and me
Sometimes I can't believe after all these years
I just think I'll never leave here
She said it's so funny
How life runs out so fast
Let's take another drink
And here's to the past
That same old crowd
That drags me down
Another day in a boring town
That same old crowd
That brings me down
A boring life in a boring town
And remember when they looked through you
And then looked past me
We were the ones they said would always leave
So when you go, just think of me
Think of me. (woah-oh-oh)
A boring life in a boring town
With the same old crowd (woah-oh-oh)
When I used to say, i'd never say
That I'm rotting here today (woah-oh-oh)
With that same old crowd
That's always been around
And I always thought that...
Yea how we always thought that...
And I always thought I'd be
The first to go!
A boring life
A boring town. (woah-oh-oh)
A boring life
A boring town. (woah-oh-oh)
A boring life
A boring town!Embed
