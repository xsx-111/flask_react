All My Best Friends Are Metalheads Lyrics
This is a fair request and I promise I will not judge any person only as a teenager, and you will constantly remind yourself that some of my generation judges people by their race, their belief, or the color of their skin, and that this is no more right than saying that all teenagers are drunken dope addicts or glue sniffers

You think its strange, that there's a way
Of how you looked, and how you act, and how you think
Pretend they're not the same as you
You think its strange, that there's a way
Of how you looked, and how you act, and how you think
Pretend they're not the same as you

Do you know about her strength in convictions
Or how she puts all her faith in religion
Did we take the time to really discover
How little we know about each other

Keep us from saying anything
And separate from everything
And all this really means is
You're the one in the crowd
And you're paranoid of every sound
You're not the friend
You won't miss anyhow
You think its strange, that there's a way
Of how you looked, and how you act, and how you think
Pretend they're not the same as you


Keep us from saying anything
Can't separate from everything
And all this really means is, You're one in a crowd
And you're paranoid of every sound
Keep us from saying anything
Can't separate from everything
And all this really means is you're one in a crowd and you're paranoid of every sound
You're not the friend, You won't miss anyhow

Do you know about her strength in convictions
Or how she puts all her faith in religion
Did ya take the time to really discover
How little we know about each other
Keep us from saying anything Can't separate from everything
And all this really means is You're one in a crowd
And you're paranoid of every sound
Keep us from saying anything. Can't separate from everything
And all this really means is You're one in a crowd
And you're paranoid of every sound
Paranoid of every sound.Paranoid of every sound1Embed
