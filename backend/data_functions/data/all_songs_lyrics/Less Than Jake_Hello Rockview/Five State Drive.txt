Five State Drive LyricsGot on the 47
Transfer to the 89
Left town, east-bound pass
Saw the city size
You know it's hard
To leave your past behind
As I pass the crummy bars
And beat up cars
Nothing will change your mind
By now, think I've found
Things changed just don't look
That way to me. Or it just looks
That way to me
By now, think I've found
Things changed just look
Re-arranged to me
Never looked that way to me
A Half-past 7
Now I'm on the 95
Sick of malls, and alcohol
Just passed the next state line
I know it's hard
To leave your past behind
As I think the corner creeps
And dirty streets
Nothing will change your mind
There's no turning back this time
By now, think I've found
Things changed just don't look
That way to me. Or it just looks
That way to me
By now, think I've found
Things changed just look
Re-arranged to me
Never looked that way..
And when goin up's like goin' on
And never going back, no
Its just like giving up, yea
And when goin offs like goin' on
It feels like going nowhere
Going nowhere fast
By now, think I've found
Things changed just don't look
That way to me. Or it just looks
That way to meeeeee!
By now, think I've found
Things changed just look
Re-arranged to me
Never looked that way to me
By now, think I've found
(Never looked that way to me.)
Things changed just don't look
That way to me
By now, think I've found
(Never looked that way to me.)
Things changed just don't look
That way to me
By now, think I've found
(Never looked that way to me.)
Things changed just don't look
That way to me
Never looked that way to meEmbed
