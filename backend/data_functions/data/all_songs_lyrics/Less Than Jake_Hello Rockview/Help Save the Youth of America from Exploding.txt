Help Save the Youth of America from Exploding Lyrics
Sit down, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Sit down, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost

And just outside I can hear the sound
Of the early morning street
Becoming way too loud
Yeah the hum, of the engines in the cars
On the street, yeah
On the street

And with this cigarette that I just lit
As I passed the 53rd Street Bridge
Right now the world just seems too big
The world just seems too big

Sit down, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Sit down, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
And just outside, I can see my breath
In between the words
That fog my spinning head
And I can see the sun coming up
And it's just light enough to see

Another cigarette that I just lit
As I passed the 53rd Street Bridge
Right now the world just seems too big
The world just seems too big

Sit down, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Sit down, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Sit down
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Sit down (remind me how)
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Growing up and getting lost
And all the late-night calls
With all the lost hopes
And all the missed connections (connections)
And the lost directions

Sit down, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Sit down, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Sit down
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lost
Down-own, now, remind me how
This is the same old story
Of growing up and getting lostEmbed
