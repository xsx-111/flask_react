1648 Lyrics
While Europe speak of peace, all other battles cease
There’s a man who aims for more than he can reach
(Blood) All over
(Prague) On fire
(Burn) All of Bohemia set ablaze
Stand on their own

The road to the city has been blocked
Denied to enter the gates
Though they tried
When Prague was called to arms
They fought them on the bridge
Their freedom was at stake

Stand and fight, the city is burning
Königsmarck lost, stopped him at Karluv Most
Stained by blood, their brothers die side by side
Did what they could
Died where they stood

Their city has been besieged, all hell on Prague unleashed
As the cannons crush the walls, the city shakes
(Fear) is spreading
(Hate) increasing
(Death) and pain is all that Sweden brought
Rise and strike back
The walls of the city's been breached, reclaimed
On that very night, and sustained
They did it on their own
They fought them on the bridge
Their freedom was at stake

Stand and fight, the city is burning
Königsmarck lost, stopped him at Karluv Most
Stained by blood, their brothers die side by side
Did what they could
Died where they stood

Unconquered city on Vltavas shore
Start of the conflict and end of the war
Unconquered city on Vltavas shore
Is protected by its people
And thirty years ago the war begun
It has returned to where it started

The road to the city has been blocked
Denied to enter the gates
Though they tried
When Prague was called to arms
They fought them on the bridge
Their freedom was at stake
Stand and fight, the city is burning
Königsmarck lost, stopped him at Karluv Most
Stained by blood, their brothers die side by side
Did what they could
Died where they stood

Stand and fight, the city is burning
Königsmarck lost, stopped him at Karluv Most
Stained by blood, their brothers die side by side
Did what they could
Died where they stood5Embed
