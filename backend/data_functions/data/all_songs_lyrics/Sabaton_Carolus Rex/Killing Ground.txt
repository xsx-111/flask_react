Killing Ground Lyrics
Frozen ground
Ride with the wind
Emerge from the gunsmoke like demons
Rehnski√∂ld's men
Charging their flanks
The enemy trembles with fear

One by one the Saxons disband
Or die where they stand

Killing ground
Even though you surrender
Turn around
You will never survive
Killing ground
As the battle of Fraustadt turns

(Fall in line)
Battle formations
(Show no fear)
Riding them down
(Break their will)
Show them no mercy
Caroleans attack
Round them up, look into their eyes
They beg for their lives

Killing ground
Even though you surrender
Turn around
You will never survive
Killing ground
As the battle of Fraustadt turns

See the Caroleans standing tall
All for one and one for all
Enemies fall at their feet
Begging for their mercy
See the Caroleans standing tall
Conquer lands and slaughter all
Enemies fall at their feet
Victory and great defeat


One by one the Saxons disband
Or die where they stand
Killing ground
Even though you surrender
Turn around
You will never survive
Killing ground
As the battle of Fraustadt turns

Killing ground
Even though you surrender
Turn around
You will never survive
Killing ground
As the battle of Fraustadt turns2Embed
