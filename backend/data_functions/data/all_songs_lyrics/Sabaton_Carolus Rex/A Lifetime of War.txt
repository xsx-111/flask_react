A Lifetime of War Lyrics
Two ways to view the world
So similar at times
Two ways to rule the world
To justify their crimes

By kings and queens young men are sent to die in war
Their propaganda speaks those words been heard before
Two ways to view the world brought Europe down in flames
Two ways to rule

Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war

From dawn to dawn they're fighting die where they stand
The fog of war lies thick when armies scorch the land
When all of Europe is burning what can be done
They've been to war a decade two more to come
Long way from home
(Döpas och dö i strid)
Lifetime at war

Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war


When they face death they're all alike
No right or wrong
Rich or poor
No matter who they served before
Good or bad
They're all the same
Rest side by side now
Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war

Has man gone insane
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war
It spreads like disease
There's no sign of peace
Religion and greed cause millions to bleed
Three decades of war2Embed
