Carolus Rex (English) Lyrics
All embrace me
Itâ€™s my time to rule at last
Fifteen years have I been waiting
To sit upon my throne
No allegiance
I will swear no oath
Crowned by God not by the church
As my power is divine

They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time has come

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies
See Carolus rise
Proved in battle
Led my men to victory
No man alive or dead commands me
I answer to the Lord
Hear my orders
Question me and die!
What I say was said in heaven
And so it shall be done

I know I was destined to rule alone
All for myself I have claimed the throne
Born to rule
My time is now

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies
See Carolus rise
All that's thine, shall be mine there's no stopping me
All over Europe my rule shall be questioned by none
All i see, give to me, that is my decree
My will be done


They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time is now!

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies
(With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will)
To the skies
See Carolus rise
To the skies
See Carolus rise6Embed
