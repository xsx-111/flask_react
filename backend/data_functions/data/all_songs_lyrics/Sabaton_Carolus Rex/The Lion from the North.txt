The Lion from the North Lyrics
A time of religion and war
Legends tell the tale of a lion
This beast in the shape of a man
With a dream to rule sea and land
And all those who stand in his way  die
By God and victorious arms
With the righteous that follows him south
Once more, set ashore, to war!

Legends have taught
Battles fought
This lion has no fear at heart
Lion, come forth
Come from the north
Come from the north

Gustavus Adolphus
Libera et impera
Acerbus et ingens
Augusta per angusta

A storm over Europe unleashed
Dawn of war, a trail of destruction
The power of Rome won't prevail
See the Catholics shiver and shake
The future of warfare unveiled
Showed the way that we still walk today
Der LÃ¶we aus Mitternacht comes
Once more, he is here, for war
Stories of old
Truth unfold
Control over Europe he holds
Freedom he'll bring
Lion and King
Lion and King

Gustavus Adolphus
Libera et impera
Acerbus et ingens
Augusta per angusta
Gustavus Adolphus, go forth
Libera, impera!
Acerbus et ingens, go forth
Libera, impera!

Mighty eagle, rule alone
Liberator, claim the throne
Lion from the northern land
Take the scepter from his hand
Mighty eagle, rule alone
Liberator, claim the throne
Lion from the northern land
Take the scepter from his hand
Mighty eagle, rule alone
(Oh, you lion from the north)
Liberator, claim the throne
Lion from the northern land
(Oh, you lion from the north)
Take the scepter from his hand
Mighty eagle, rule alone!
Liberator, claim the throne!
Lion from the northern land
Take the scepter from his hand

Legends have taught
Battles fought
This lion has no fear at heart
Lion, come forth
Come from the north
Come from the north

Gustavus Adolphus
Libera et impera
Acerbus et ingens
Augusta per angusta
Gustavus Adolphus, go forth!
Libera, impera!
Acerbus et ingens, go forth!
Libera, impera!1Embed
