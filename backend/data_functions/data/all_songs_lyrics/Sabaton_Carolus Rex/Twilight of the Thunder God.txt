Twilight of the Thunder God LyricsThere comes Fenrir's twin
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves
Jörmungandr twists and turns
Mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of Mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlôdyn's son
Protector of Mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits
Vingtor rides to face
The snake with hammer high
At the edge of the world
Bolts of lightning fills the air
As Mjölnir does its work
The dreadful serpent roars in pain
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of Mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlôdyn's son
Protector of Mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits
Mighty Thor grips the snake
Firmly by its tongue
Lifts his hammer high to strike
Soon his work is done
Vingtor sends the giant snake
Bleeding to the depths
Twilight of the Thunder God
Ragnarök awaits
Twilight of the Thunder God
Twilight of the Thunder God
Twilight of the Thunder God
Twilight of the Thunder God
Thor! Odin's son
Protector of Mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! Hlôdyn's son
Protector of Mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Ragnarök awaits1Embed
