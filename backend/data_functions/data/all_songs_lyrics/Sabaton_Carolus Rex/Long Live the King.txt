Long Live the King Lyrics
Dreams are seldom shattered, by a bullet in the dark
Rulers come and rulers go, will our kingdom fall apart?
Who shall we now turn to, when our leaders lost their heart?
Lives are lost but at what cost, will the grand dream fall apart?

Killed by his own or by his foes, turned the tide
300 years still no one knows, the secret remains

Broken dreams so grand, sing of his final stand, long live Carolus
Brought by soldiers hand, back to the fatherland, long live Carolus Rex

Brought him back to Sweden, where we put him in a chest
Years of war and agony, now the king can finally rest
What will be uncovered, from that cold November night
Fredrikshald, what happened there, will it ever come to light?'

Killed by his own or by his foes, turned the tide
300 years still no one knows, the secret remains

Broken dreams so grand, sing of his final stand, long live Carolus
Brought by soldiers hand, back to the fatherland, long live Carolus Rex

For their honor
For their glory
For the men who fought and bled
A soldier from Sweden remembers the dead

Broken dreams so grand, sing of his final stand, long live Carolus
Brought by soldiers hand, back to the fatherland, long live Carolus Rex

Broken dreams so grand, sing of his final stand, long live Carolus
Brought by soldiers hand, back to the fatherland
Carolus Rex!5Embed
