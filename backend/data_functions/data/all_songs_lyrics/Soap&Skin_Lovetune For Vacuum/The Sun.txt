The Sun LyricsI see the sun
I see the sun
I see the sun
I see the sun
She dawns
She burns
She grows
She feeds
She spews
She dies above us
And builts the shadows
Which faces myself
She drives me
Into the black hole
The doors opens there
The skin opens there
The doors opens there
The skin opens thereEmbed
