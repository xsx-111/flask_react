Thanatos Lyrics
Glaucoma on our eye
Plague to weather
Until they run dry

Ages of delirium
Curse of my oblivion

I swell without a scar
To the end of time
A shell without a star
At the end of time

Watch the bend of my wandering
Of hunting with the lightning gun

Tremor on my heaven sun
Tares above my kingdom come

Torn open tomb
I fell in your
Cold fission bomb
I fell in your war
Ages of delirium
Curse of my oblivion

Tremor on my heaven sun
Tares above my kingdom comeEmbed
