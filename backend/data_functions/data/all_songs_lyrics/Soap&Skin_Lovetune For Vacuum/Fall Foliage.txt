Fall Foliage LyricsYou made me smile with my heart
You made me beg for admission cards
You will never stay
In my home, on my way
Forlorn from today
We have nothing more to share
Only air, that old breath
All I pare off to a road
As my goad into my grave
One sear scratch is laying in the door
Falling on the floor
All fleet snatch is laying waste my gore
It will drop down on the floor
You will never stay in my home, on my way
Forlorn from today
We'll never find us againEmbed
