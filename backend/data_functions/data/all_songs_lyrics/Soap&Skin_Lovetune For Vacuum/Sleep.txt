Sleep LyricsI lay on the floor
They asked me what I do tonight
It answers
Search for the moon
For the moon
No, don't follow him
Swallow him
Swallow him
Swallow it
I swear I will be good to you
I swear I will be good to you
I swear I will be good to you
I swear I will be good
I swear I will be
I swear I will be
I will be
Time
Come hold me back
I'll dream of what I've dreamed of tonight
I dream of what I call love
Time
Come hold me back
I'll dream of what I've dreamed of tonight
I dream of what I call love1Embed
