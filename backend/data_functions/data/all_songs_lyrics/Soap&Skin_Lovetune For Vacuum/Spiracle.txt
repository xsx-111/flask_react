Spiracle LyricsWhen I was a child
I toyed with dirt and I fought
As a child
I killed the slugs, I bored with a bough
In their spiracle
When I was a child
Peers pushed me hard
In my head, in my neck, in my chest, in my waist, in my butt
I still beg
Please help me
When I was a child
I threw with dung as I fought
As a child
I killed all thugs and bored with a bough
In their spiracle
When I was a child
Foes pushed me hard
In my ___, in my neck, in my chest, in my waist, in my butt
I still beg
Please help me
When I was a child
I rend my tongue distraught
As a child
I killed my thoughts and bored with a bough
In my spiracle
When I was a child
Fears pushed me hard
In my head, in my neck, in my chest, in my waist
I never loved
I still beg
Please help me
I was a child, I was a child
I was a child, I was a child
I am a child1Embed
