Big Jet Plane Lyrics
Fell from grace, I lost my faith
My heart feels like a stone
I'm paying the price of of a drunken night
I'm wasting in the twilight zone
Broke the spell, I hate myself
The light of love don't shine
A women's touch can cost so much
I've lost my pearl, messing with swine

Fly me home on a big jet plane
Fly me home through the thunder and rain
Fly me home to the healing hands
Fly me home to the promised land

Pain won't quit, my head's in bits
Desire as sin is a jail
I'll make a vow and break a vow
Oh, nothing beats a try but a fail

Fly me home on a big jet plane
Fly me home through the thunder and rain
Fly me home to the healing hands
Fly me home to the promised land
Fly me home on a big jet plane
Fly me home through the thunder and rain
Fly me home to the healing hands
Fly me home to the promised land

Take me home on a big jet plane
Take me home through the thunder and rain
Take me home to the healing hands
Take me home to the promised land

Take me home on a big jet plane
Take me home through the thunder and rain
Take me home to the healing hands
Take me home to the promised landEmbed
