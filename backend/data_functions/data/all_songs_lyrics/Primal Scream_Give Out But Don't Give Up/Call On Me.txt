Call On Me Lyrics
If you're broke down and you're needing a ride
If you're feeling more dead than alive
If you're hungry and you're needing a feast
If you wanna get drunk every night of the week

Call on me, baby
Call on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you're lonely, you can hold me
Call on me

If you're bored right out of your mind
If you're looking for a partner in crime
If you're hung up and you wanna get down
You wanna shake your funky hips all around

Call on me, baby
Call on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you're lonely, you can hold me
Call on me

Call, call, call on me
Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?
Call, call, call on me
Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?
Call, call, call on me
Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?
Call, call, call on me
Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?
Call, call, call on me
Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?
Call, call, call on me
Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?
Oh yeah, won't you call on me, baby?
(Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?)
My, my, my, got to call on me, honey
(Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?)
Oh yeah, won't you call on me, baby?
(Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?)
My, my, my, got to call on me, honey
(Baby, baby, baby, won't you call on me?)Embed
