Free Lyrics
Got a sad, destructive feeling
Creeping through my soul
When I'm awake and when I'm dreaming
Just won't leave me alone
I know you've got another lover
I know you've got something to hide
You've been acting kind of nervous
You can't look me in the eye

I can tell, I can tell
I can tell you're cheating me
You're cheating me, cheat, cheat
You're cheating me
Ooh, baby, I'm free of you
Ooh, baby, I'm free of you
Free of you

Don't want you to touch me
Don't you touch me, don't you touch me
Everything is broken
I believe in you no more
Does she satisfy you, honey?
Does she make you feel alive?
I can't stand the thought of you
Naked in someone else's arms
I can tell, I can tell
I can tell you're cheating me
You're cheating me, cheat, cheat
You're cheating me
Ooh, baby, I'm free of you
Ooh, baby, I'm free of you
Free of you

I can tell, I can tell
I can tell you're cheating me
You're cheating me, cheat, cheat
You're cheating me
Ooh, baby, I'm free of you
Ooh, baby, I'm free of you
Free of you

I'm free of you, I'm free of you
I'm free of you, said I'm free of you
I've got this sad destructive feeling in my body, baby
You've been cheating on me
You've been cheating on me
You've been cheating on me
I can tell, I can tell
You've been cheating on me
And now I'm free of youEmbed
