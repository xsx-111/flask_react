Everybody Needs Somebody LyricsLife on your own, don't really make you free
You can't put your arms around a memory
A little bit of soul is worth more than gold
Everybody needs somebody, everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody, I need you
The lonely days and nights were paved with dreams
I've loved and lost and I do believe
A little bit of soul is worth more than gold
Everybody needs somebody, everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs somebody, I need you
Everybody needs somebody, everybody needs somebody
Oh yeah, I said, everybody needs somebody, I need you
We got to get together babe, we got to get together babe
We got to get together babe, we got to get together babe
We got to get together babe, we got to get together babe
We got to get together babe, we got to get together babe
We got to get together babe, we got to get together babe
We got to get together babe, we got to get together babe
We got to get together babe, we got to get together babe
We got to get together babe, we got to get together babeEmbed
