Sad And Blue Lyrics
Baby, I love you, baby, I need you
Baby, I love you, baby, I need you
Baby, I'm lonely, I need you here to hold me
I'm sad, so sad and blue, I'm not with you

Baby, I'm thankful, thank you for your kindness
Baby, I'm thankful, thankful, thankful
Thank you for your kindness
You always stood by me, you never denied me
I'm sad, so sad and blue, I'm not with you

Shine on me, sister, let your love light shine
Shine a light on me, sister, I've got a ragged heart
I'm feeling dark, let it shine, let it shine
Let your love light shine

Baby, I love you, baby, I need you
Baby, I love you, baby, I need you
Baby, I'm lonely, I need you here to hold me
I'm sad, so sad and blue, I'm not with you

Please hold me, I'm lonely
Please hold me, I'm lonely1Embed
