Wordless Song LyricsI just can't find the words to say
I just can't find the words to say
That something died so deep inside
I just can't find the words to say
Today, ooh
Always, ooh
Today, ooh
Always, ooh
Oh, one day you'll find her
Sleeping, oh, on the dune
And beneath the August sun
Your song will come true
Down that road that leads to nowhere
Lies a soul for you to discover
And beneath the August sun
Your song will come trueEmbed
