Better Rooms... LyricsOooh Oooh Oooh Ooh Ooh
There's better rooms in better times
And better times in better rooms
I know this place where we can go
The birds and trees they talk to me
And
Ooohh Ooohh Ooohh Ooh Ooh
There's better foods in better feasts
And better kings in better lands
I know this place where we could be
The birds and trees they talk to me
And Ooohh Ooohh Oooh Ooh Ooh
Ooohh Ooohh Oooh Ooh OohEmbed
