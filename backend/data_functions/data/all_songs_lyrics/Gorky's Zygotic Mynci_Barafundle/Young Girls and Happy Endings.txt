Young Girls and Happy Endings Lyrics
You know young girls like happy endings
Well I guess that's the way it's got to be
'cos without all these happy endings
What would happen to my industry?

(You know that you)
You know I wrote this shit to sell ya, sell ya
(You know that I)
You know I never mean a word I tell 'ya
(You know that we)
You know I wrote this hit to sell ya, sell ya
(You know that I)
You know I never mean a word I tell 'ya

Ivory towers wrapped round in silk
A young calf with his mother's milk
Victorian England shining so bright
Two lovers kissing in the moonlight

(You know that you)
You know I wrote that hit to sell ya, sell ya
(You know that I)
You know I never mean a word I tell 'ya
(You know that we)
You know I wrote this shit to sell ya, sell ya
(You know that I)
You know I never mean a word I tell 'ya
And the feeling's stronger
The reason's longer, oo...

You know young girls like happy endings
Well I guess that's the way it's got to be
'cos without all these happy endings
What would happen to my industryEmbed
