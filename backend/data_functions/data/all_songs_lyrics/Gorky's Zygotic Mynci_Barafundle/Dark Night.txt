Dark Night Lyrics
Oh, dark night darker than thee
Such a dark dark night dark for Halloween
And the torches torches burning bright
And Molly doesn't float on this dark dark night

But what is all this liquid all inside my brain
Swooping around like indoor rain that evening I was the rocks
The moon shone right through me lit up the ripples in the sea

Oh, dark night darker than thee
All cables on the ground and children up all night
Down in the village young girl burning bright
And no moonlight on this dark dark night

That evening I was the rocks the moon shone right through me
Lit up the ripples in the sea but what if all the liquid
All inside my brain starts leaking out when starts the pain?Embed
