The Barafundle Bumbler Lyrics
Another day has begun
Family comes in for
Doctor takes off the top
Mother is

And if my mother asks me
I'm only watching birds on the sea
Well what else could I do?
When loneliness is so cruel

Couples are best
When they start to caress
One finger here
One fing-

And if my mother asks me
I'm only collecting stamps up a tree
Well what else could I do
With no idea of you

You watch the ocean coming in and go
Lighting up around his toes
Like electricity 1 and 0
Ah, look at all the sun in her eyesEmbed
