Miniature Kingdoms LyricsChanged by known immature
Charge you to all my friends
Cut it with dental floss
My miniature kingdom
My king size ego
Call that a day (call that a day)
My miniature kingdom
(x4)
Changed my smile to a frown
Now that I'm in the real world
Just can't admit I'm lost
My miniature kingdom
My king size ego
Call that a day (call that a day)
My miniature kingdom
