Sometimes The Father Is The Son LyricsAll that's safe to hear
Is collapsing around your ears
With a foundering return in the morning
Watch the Irish sea
Going out but it never takes me
Easy and free
To be whatever you want to be
Sometimes the father is the son
There's no reason to kill
But there's a reason to die
With a foundering return in the morning
Watch the Irish sea
Going out but it never takes me
Easy and free
To be whatever you want to be
Sometimes the father is the son
Easy and free
To be whatever you want to be
Sometimes the father is the sonEmbed
