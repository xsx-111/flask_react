Diamond Dew Lyrics
Awake, awake to love and work, luck is in the sky
Fields are wet, diamond dew, worlds awake to cry
Child comes home, home from school, singing merrily
Room is warm, organ plays, house by the sea
And we'll think it all again so lets

Keep the fire burning, and take in all the sights
Like the encovering of the bodies as the giant sun soars up
Ooh

And we'll think it all again

Awake, awake to love and work, luck is in the sky
Fields are wet, diamond dew, worlds awake to cry
Child comes home, home from school, singing merrily
Love is warm, organ plays, house by the sea
And we'll think it all again so lets

Keep the fire burning, and take in all the sights
Like the encovering of the bodies as the giant sun soars up
Ooh
Well there's evil in his eyes, as the child disobeys
And they play the sport at lunchtime as the giant sun soars up

Ooh
Don't want to think it all againEmbed
