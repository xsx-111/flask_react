The Wizard And The Lizard LyricsIt's a new day, the sun has risen
The cock goes cock-a-doodle-doo
The cat curls his tail, and then miaows
The alarm clock rings, a new day has begun
Lizard complains "My voice never rings true"
Wizard proclaims "Then I shall cure you"
I'll take out the sun from the deepest south
And place it in a  mouth
(And from that day onward the lizard's voice rang true
Echoing thousands of times, surfing the canyon's rocks
Well, that's just the way it was)Embed
