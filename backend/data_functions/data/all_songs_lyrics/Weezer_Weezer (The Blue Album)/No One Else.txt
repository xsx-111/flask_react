No One Else Lyrics
My girl's got a big mouth
With which she blabbers a lot
She laughs at most everything
Whether it's funny or not
And if you see her
Tell her it's over now

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else

My girl's got eyeballs
In the back of her head
She looks around and around
You know, it makes me sad to see her like that
Please don't believe her, she says that for anyone
And if you see her, tell her it's a hey, hey, hey, hey!

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else
And if you see her, tell her it's over now!

And if you see her, tell her it's over now
And if you watch her go, watch her go, watch her, watch her, watch her, watch her!

I want a girl who will laugh for no one else
When I'm away, she puts her makeup on the shelf
When I'm away, she never leaves the house
I want a girl who laughs for no one else, no one else
Yeah!2Embed
