In the Garage Lyrics
I've got a Dungeon Master's Guide, I've got a 12-sided die
I've got Kitty Pryde, and Nightcrawler too
Waiting there for me, yes I do, I do

I've got posters on the wall, my favorite rock group KISS
I've got Ace Frehley, I've got Peter Criss
Waiting there for me, yes I do, I do

In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
In the garage

I've got electric guitar, I play my stupid songs
I write these stupid words, and I love every one
Waiting there for me, yes I do, I do

In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song
In the garage, in the garage, yeah!

In the garage, I feel safe
No one cares about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me sing this song

In the garage, I feel safe
No one laughs about my ways
In the garage, where I belong
No one hears me, no one hears me
No one hears me, no one hears me
No one hears me sing this song5Embed
