An Older Lover Etc. LyricsYou'd better take an older lover X6
You'll soon get tired of her
To take an older lover
Get ready for old stories
Of teenage sex
From the early sixties
Under cover
Behind office desks
Old divorces
Children's faces
You'd better take a younger lover
You'd better take a younger lover
Or take an older lover
You'll soon get tired of her
(She'll shag you out on the table)
Dear girls
Doctor Annabel lies! X3
You raced before
It's been done
Tripped and stepped on
You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take an older lover
Or take a younger monster
But deserve better
You'd better take a younger lover
You'd better take a younger lover
You'll miss your older lover
Her love was like your Mother's
With added attractions
You'd better take a younger lover X4
You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take an older lover
You'd better take a younger lover
Doctor Annabel lies! X4
On the colour page
French fries spread on her face
On the future autolytic enzyme sonEmbed
