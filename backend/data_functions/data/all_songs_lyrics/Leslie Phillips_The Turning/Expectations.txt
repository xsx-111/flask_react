Expectations LyricsYou lock me up with your expectations
You lock me up with your expectations
Loosen the pressure you choked me with
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
You stripped my heart with your accusations
You shut me into an affectation
Loosen the pressure you choked me with
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Let me pull down on your high ideals
To sweet earth honest and wide
Tumble with me in an undoubted craze
Don't hold back the tide
You might get caught in sweet captivation
If you let your mind take this aberration
Loosen the pressure you choked me with
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
You lock me up with your accusations
You lock me up with your accusations
You lock me up
You lock me up
You lock me upEmbed
