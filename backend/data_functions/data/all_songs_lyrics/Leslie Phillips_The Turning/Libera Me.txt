Libera Me LyricsDreams that I can't trace
Pull my heart away
Form love I long to taste
Why do I run away
When I come face to face
With anything I need?
I am so afraid;
If I keep hoping there will come a day
When my heart is open that you will walk away
Like you were never there
And I don't know all the truth
From the lying
But I know that I need you
'cause I am dying from bein' held by hell
In this cell of blinding fear
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Liberame, liberame, liberame
From this dark dream to a life stream
Libera, libera, liberame
Form this bruisedsould living half whole
Libera, libera, liberame
I know there is a place
Free from worries
Before I turn this grace
Into deisorder
Ive got to find a way
Out fo this chaos
And I don't know all the truth
Form the lying
But I know that I need you
Cause I am dying
From being held by hell
In this cell of blinding fear
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Libera, libera, liberame
From this dark dream
To a life stream
Libera, libera, liberame
From this bruised soul
Living half whole
Libera, libera, liberame
Let the truth break
What my fears make
Libera, libera, liberame
From this dark dream
To a life stream
Libera, libera, liberameEmbed
