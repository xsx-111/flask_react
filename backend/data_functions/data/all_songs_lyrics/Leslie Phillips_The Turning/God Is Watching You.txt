God Is Watching You LyricsWhen your life's about to start - God is watching you
When you have a shattered heart - God is watching you
When you're a slave and when you're freed - God is watching you
When what you call love's really need - God is watching you
God is watching you
God is watching you
When you wake up in the night - God is watching you
When you're dancing in the light - God is watching you
When you don't need to use force - God is watching you
When you don't ever feel remorse - God is watching you
When you're a hero to us all - God is watching you
When you take that fated fall - God is watching you
When you hide your head in the sand - God is watching you
When you find a brand new land - God is watching you
When out of fear you judge your friend - God is watching you
When you let a stranger in - God is watching you
When you always have to win - God is watching you
When love requires that you give in - God is watching you
When you play the cards you're dealt - God is watching you
When you won't reveal yourself - God is watching you
When you believe enough to die - God is watching you
When you say your last goodbye - God is watching youEmbed
