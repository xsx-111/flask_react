The Turning LyricsThe turning from light to shadows
From burning to indifference
The turning of heart to granite
Of steel hopes to molten fear
And when it turns on me
Don't let it turn on me
The turning of admiration to obsession
Of caring to control
The turning of shouts to whispers
Of warm and full to grey and hollowEmbed
