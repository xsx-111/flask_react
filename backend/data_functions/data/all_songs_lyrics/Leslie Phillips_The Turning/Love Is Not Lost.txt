Love Is Not Lost LyricsLove is not lost
Boy
Boy meets girl
And you know the rest
Boy loses his girl
In their love's first test
Is this supposed to be a happy ending now
Is this the way it always goes
Girl
Throws in her heart
Like a losing hand
She uses the boys
'cause she thinks she'll never find her man
Is this supposed to be a happy ending now
Is this the way it always goes
Well I think I want my money back
Because that's not all I know
Love is not lost
It's not a lost cause
I meet you
And you cut my heart
You shake my ideals
Until they fall apart
Have I lost it if I hope for something more
Than feeling fatalistic pain
And if true love never did exist
How could we know it's name
Love is not lost
It's not a lost cause
Don't give up now
Love is not lostEmbed
