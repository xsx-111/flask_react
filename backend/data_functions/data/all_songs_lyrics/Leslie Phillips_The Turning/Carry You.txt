Carry You LyricsWhen the water's too high
When the water's too high
I will carry you
I will carry you
When the water's too high
When the water's too high
I will carry you
I will carry you
I will carry you
I will carry you
I will carry you
When the water's too high
I will carry you
When the night is too black
When the night is too black
I will carry you
I will carry you
When the water's too high
When the water's too high
I will carry you
I will carry you
I will carry you
I will carry you
When the water's too high
I will carry youEmbed
