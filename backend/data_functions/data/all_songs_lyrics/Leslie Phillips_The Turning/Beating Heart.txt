Beating Heart LyricsHow long have I got
Before common days become legend
How long have I got
'til this dream of life becomes heaven
Oh, life passed too fast
It's hard to know it won't last forever
How long have I got
Before passion gives up it's fire
How long have I got
Before time strangles desire
Oh, my fear is to leave here
Never having really arrived
Who can hear my beating heart
Pounding so, wanting more
Who can hear my beating heart
Pounding on the door
How long have I got
To make mistakes and be wiser
How long have I got
To learn to be less of a liar
Oh, to face my best try I know
I need someone who is higher
How long have I got
To answer a higher calling
How long have I got
To walk the line without falling
Oh, needing meaning, wanting to know
Just what I'm here forEmbed
