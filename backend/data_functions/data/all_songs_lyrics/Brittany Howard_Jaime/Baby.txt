Baby LyricsYeah, this is the check, 1, 2
The check, 3, 4
You know who it is
You see...
I tried to be everything you'd ever want
You'll ever want, you ever would ask me to be, baby
Ha, baby
How could you call me your babe?
You don't provide for me
You don't ride for me
You don't, no, you don't
How could you call me your babe?
I tried to do everything you asked me to
I never thought you ever would ask me to leave, baby
I guess the joke's on me, baby
You never did fail to deceive
I guess that's what I get for being
So quality, babe
Ha, baby
Baby (Baby)
Baby (Baby)
Baby (Baby)
How could you call me your baby?
Come on, pick it back up
Nah, put it back down, up
Baby (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ow)Embed
