He Loves Me Lyrics
But we Christians ought not ever intentionally miss church

I don't go to church anymore
I know he still loves me

I know he still loves me when
I'm smoking blunts
Loves me when I'm drinking too much
He loves me then, yeah
He loves me when I do what I want
He loves me, he doesn't judge me
Yes, he loves me

Now, listen, brothers and sisters, when my soul is weary, I need peace

I don't need to know why
'Cause I know what love means
I don't need forgivin'

And I said to my friend who was visiting with me the other day
"He gon' live longer than me and you."
'Cause he ain't worried 'bout nothing
He ain't worried 'bout nothing
He ain't worried 'bout nothing
He ain't worried 'bout nothing
I know he still loves me when
I'm smoking blunts
Loves me when I'm drinking too much
He loves me then, yeah
He loves me when I do what I want
He loves me, he doesn't judge me
Yes, he loves me
