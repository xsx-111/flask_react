Presence Lyrics
Come what made, I have you today
And I don't want no more
I don't want tomorrow
Its promises, oh, its ache

'Cause what's this world without you in it?
You make me feel just like I'm a little kid
What's this world got without your spark?
You make me feel so black and alive

La-la-la, la, la, la-la-la, ah
La, la, la

By doin' nothing, I noticed something
I don't want no more
And I've always wanted more
Of just about everything

But what's this world without you in it?
You make me feel just like we're some little kids
What's this life like without your spark?
You make me feel so black and aliveEmbed
