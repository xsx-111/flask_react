Tomorrow LyricsI found myself free from another
To walk into another
I'm only free as I remember
I stayed busy enough doing the rituals, you know?
And pretend I don't see (Pretend I don't see)
My worth (See my worth)
Changin' hands
I'm not lovin' (I'm not lovin')
I'm returnin' to (I'm returnin' to)
To whatever I wanna do (Whatever I wanna do)
And makin' plans
Tomorrow, I'll be better
Tomorrow, we always talk about tomorrow
But now that we're here
Without liftin' a finger
How you figure
We get lifted
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Now that we're here, what you gon' do with it?
(We gonna say, "What the fuck?")
I feel, but what you gon' show me?
(All the love)
But what do you see?
(Not enough)
Now what stands in the way?
(All of us)
Now what you gon' do 'bout it?
(Get up, get up)
Ow, ow, ow-ow
Mm, mm, mm-mm
And tomorrow, I ain't talkin' 'bout tomorrow
Ooh, owEmbed
