Goat Head LyricsSee, tomatoes are green
And cotton is white
My heroes are black
So why God got blue eyes?
My daddy, he stayed
My grandmama's a maid
My mama was brave
To take me outside
'Cause mama is white
And daddy is black
When I first got made
Guess I made these folks mad
See, I know my colors, see
But what I wanna know is...
Who slashed my dad's tires and put a goat head in the back?
I guess I wasn't s'posed to know that, too bad
I guess I'm not 'posed to mind 'cause I'm brown, I'm not black
But who said that?
See, I'm black, I'm not white
But I'm that, nah, nah, I'm this, right?
I'm one drop of three-fifths, right?
Goat head in the back
Goat head in the back
Goat head in the back
Goat head in the back
Goat head in the back
Goat head in the back
Goat head in the back
Goat head in the back
Goat head in the back1Embed
