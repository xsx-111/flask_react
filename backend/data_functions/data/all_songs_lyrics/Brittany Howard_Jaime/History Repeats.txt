History Repeats LyricsI just don't wanna be back in this place again
I mean, I done cried a little
Tried a little, failed a little
I don’t wanna do it again
(Oh, I don't wanna do it again)
Do you feel me? (Yes, ma'am)
Do you feel me? (Oh lord)
Do you feel me? (Yes, ma’am)
Do you feel me? (Yes, ma'am)
Do you? Do you?
I mean, I've already been
I came and went
I washed my hands with it
I don't wanna do it again
Don't push me
Push me, push me, push me
Pull me in, ooh
Hoo, I don't wanna go back here again, mmm
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again (One more time again)
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again (Let me jump in, this time now)
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
History repeats and we defeat ourselves
Come on everybody, one more time again
