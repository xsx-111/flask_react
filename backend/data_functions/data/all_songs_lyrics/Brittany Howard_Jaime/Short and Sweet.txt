Short and Sweet Lyrics
There are miles between us
Time between us
There is something between us
I may be a fool to dream of you
But, God, it feels so good to dream at all
Something short and sweet
There's always a light over my head for you
I am waiting, I am waiting
Time will always try to kill me

There are mountains between us
There is time between us
Oh, ain't there something between us?
Something short and sweet

I don't care if I should
Do you wanna hurt me?
'Cause I've been hurtin' all alone
It didn't kill me, no
But it wasn't no fun
Come and get you some
Just the beginning
I only want the beginning
We'll give each other all of our best
And then, time can do what it wants with it
There are mountains between us
There is time between us
Oh, ain't there something between us?
Something short and sweet

So, why can't I wait?
Why can't I wait?
Why can't I think?
Why can't I wake without you always appearing?
Oh,, I better not wait too long
'Cause time is gonna kill it
Time is gonna kill it
Time is gonna kill it
Time is gonna kill itEmbed
