Run to Me LyricsRun, run to me
Run, run to me
And I will be your partner
When you can't stand to be alone
Run, run to me
Run, run to me
It’s not funny being free and wild
There's no joy all on your own
There's no weapon against this loneliness
Except my loving arms
If you’re feeling like a stranger
Call out in the rain
Know there's a god in waiting
Call out to me
Run, run to me
All the world, let's put it off
They don't deserve your funny charms
They don't make you feel sane
If there's no one left to say goodbye to
If there's no last message to impart
Oh, your tires are left behind you
Run, run, run, run, run to me
Oh, run to me
And I will be your partner
When you can't stand it anymore1Embed
