Georgia Lyrics
I just want Georgia to notice me
I just want Georgia to notice me
I just want Georgia to notice me
I just want Georgia

Georgia, see you don't know it, but
I'm afraid to tell you how I really feel
But show you what I really mean when I'm sayin' hello
Oh, how I feel to watch you come and go

I just want Georgia to notice me
I just want Georgia to notice me
I just want Georgia to notice me

Georgia, I think if I got you alone
You could tell I'm being really sincere
And I can't help the way that I was born to be
I ain't no little boy

I just want Georgia to notice me
I just want Georgia to notice me
I just want Georgia to notice me
I just want Georgia
Is it unnatural?
Georgia, is it cool?
I wanna tell you that I love you
Georgia, here ya come
