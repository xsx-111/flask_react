Two Swords Lyrics
I've never been one for the punch-up
But look I really hate those Nazis
A certain something starts to wind me up
How could I hate them oh so violently

When two swords slashing at each other
Only sharpen one another
And in the long run even he's your brother
Said even though that cunt's a Nazi (Nazi)

Always attack those things in someone else
Reflections that you can't face in yourself
To make precious fascistic feeling gone
It makes you turn into a bigger one
Because

Two swords slashing at each other
Only sharpen one another
And in the long run even he's your brother
Said even though that cunt's a Nazi (Nazi)

Fighting the Front or just fronting a fight?
Sometimes it's hard to see the left from the right
Are we angry or are we looking for peace?
Or just tryin' to win the war
By killing all the enemy off
Just to kill all the enemy off
Kill the enemy off
Kill the enemy off
I've never been one for the punch-up
But look I really hate those Nazis (Nazis)
A certain something gets to wind me up
How could I hate them oh so violently

When two swords slashing at each other
Only sharpen one another
And in the long run even he's your brother
Said even though that cunt's a Nazi (Nazi)
Even though that cunt's a Nazi (Nazi)
Even though that cunt's a Nazi (Nazi)Embed
