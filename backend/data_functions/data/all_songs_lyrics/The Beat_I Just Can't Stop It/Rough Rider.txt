Rough Rider LyricsShe was a rough rider
A cool stroker
A strong whiner
I had a hard night
I had a hard night
I had a hard night
Last night
Last night
I feel so broke up today
I feel so broke up today
Lord, I feel so mash up today
She was a strong whiner
A rough rider
She whiney whiney, last night
I don't know what you'd say if you saw me yesterday
But I know what you'd say if you see for me today
She was a strong whiner
A rough rider
She whiney whiney
Last night
She chop di wood
Last night
Me wore me brush
Tonight
I said me wore me brush
Tonight...Embed
