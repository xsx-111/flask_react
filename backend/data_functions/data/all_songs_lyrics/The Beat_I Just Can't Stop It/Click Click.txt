Click Click LyricsIt's a
One shot magazine , give it a spin
Open your mouth slide the barrel in
If you don't like it just don't do it again
Itchy finger, finger, trigger, trigger
Click click
Click click click
One in thirty five is saying sorry through a bottle
Say it's your job to scrape a living up, that's all it does
Well think it back over it, hurts twice as much as living
Itchy finger, finger, trigger, trigger
Faster faster faster faster
One shot this is it
Did you delay
You call it a nightmare now i call it a day
You hold yourself steady at the edge of the bed
As you say finger, finger, trigger, trigger
Click click click click click
Click click click
Faster faster faster
Faster faster faster
Faster faster faster
