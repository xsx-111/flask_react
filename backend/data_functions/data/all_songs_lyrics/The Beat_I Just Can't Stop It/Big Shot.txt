Big Shot LyricsYes, I've seen you go to work in your big car
Yes, your fat and can afford to be tasteless
You're a big shot
You want the whole lot
And if I like it or not
You still control me
You tell me what to think and what to be
I like it best in the freezing winter, boy
I like to sneer as I sail past your bus stop
I watch you struggle and it gets me red hot
I wander round in my empty office block
Big shot
I want the whole lot
And if you like it or not
I still control you
I tell you what to think and what to do
So you listen to smoking industry
You listen to the guys in the factories
You listen to the wealth and the misery
You listen to the power of money
For a big shot
Who wants a whole lot
And if you like it or not
He'll probably get it
He'll tell you when to beg and when to sit
You look like a government minister
Or a high ranking military officer
I don't think you care
You're just a big shot, yeah
Yes, I've seen you go to work in your big car
Yes, your fat and can afford to be tasteless
You're a big shot
Who wants a whole lot
And if I like it or not
You still control me
You tell me what to think and what to beEmbed
