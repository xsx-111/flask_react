Noise In This World LyricsLooking for a girlfriend
I want everything
Noise in this world
Someone to lie next to
"I want" forever "I want"
Whatever jack-knife feels like
Tipping up the blankets
"I want" forever "I want"
I'm just the crossed-out names in your address-book
Sticks in ?? waiter??, sticks in my mind/mouth
Makes me feel as false as you look
You're so graceful
You're so hateful/helpful
I feel clumsy
When I'm near you
"I want" forever "I want"
Whatever jack-knife feels like
Slipping/sitting on my own face
"I want" forever "I want"
I'm just the crossed-out names in your address-book
Sticks in ?waiter?, sticks in my mind/mouth
Makes me feel as false as you look
Repeat first verse but substituting line 7 from second verse
