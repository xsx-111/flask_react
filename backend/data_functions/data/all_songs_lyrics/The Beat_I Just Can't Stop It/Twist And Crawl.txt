Twist And Crawl LyricsSomething shows in your face
Aren't you forgetting yourself
Nearly let your mask slip
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Emotion packed in every tear
Emotion mirrors your fears
Smile and say hello dear
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Walk into a niteclub
See you standing in there
Both your eyes are on me
Wonder what makes you care
Wonder what makes you stare
Walk into a niteclub
All your friends are in there
Is that really blond hair?
Why don't you play fair
You could be in Mayfair?
You broke my heart in several pieces
Not supposed to be that easy
Have to read the books again
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
But you can't hurt me anymore
I haven't got a heart no more
No feelings get in my way
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Did you think that I'd return
Emotions all I need to learn
Now you're gonna feel the same
Vice-a-versa love and pain
Vice-a-versa love and pain
Did you think that I'd return
Emotions all I need to learn
Now you're gonna feel the same
Vice-a-versa love and pain
Vice-a-versa love and pain
Now I've made a new way
Now my mind is rearranged
Now I can't be sure again
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Are we really happy or maybe just pretending
I can't tell the difference
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawl
I can have a new face
I can have a new body
I can have a new boy
I can have a new girl
I can have a new world
I can have a new face
I can have a new body
I can have a new boy
I can have a new girl
I can have a new world
I can have a twist and crawl
I can have a twist and crawl
Twist and crawl, twist and crawl, twist and crawlEmbed
