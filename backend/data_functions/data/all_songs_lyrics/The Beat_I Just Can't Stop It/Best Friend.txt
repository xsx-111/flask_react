Best Friend LyricsI just found out the name of your best friend
You been talkin' about yourself again
And no one seems to share your views
Why doesn't everybody listen to you kid?
How come you never really seem to get through, is it you?
Talk about yourself again, you
Talk about yourself
Always you, you, you
Talk about yourself again
She's on a holiday
She's got her summer frock on
Suck on an ice cream
It's meltin' in the hot sun
First date's made you pray for more
I wanted you, wanted
Everybody knows the score
I wanted you, wanted
What are we pretendin' for?
Let's talk about ourselves on the floor
Let's talk about yourselves, nothing more i promise
Talk about ourselves again
I just found out the name of your best friend
Talk, talk, talk about yourself again
Yes i just found out the name of your best friend
I just found out the name of your best friend
You been talkin' about yourself again
And no one seems to share your views
Why doesn't anybody listen to you kid?
How come you never really seem to get through, is it you?
Talk about yourself again, you
Talk about yourself
Always you, you, you
Talk about yourself again
Again, again, again, again
I just found out the name of your best friend
Just found out the name of your best friend
I just found out the name of your best friend
I just found out the name of your best friend
Just found out the name of your best friend
I just found out the name of your best friend
Just found out the name of your best friend
I just found out the name of your best friendEmbed
