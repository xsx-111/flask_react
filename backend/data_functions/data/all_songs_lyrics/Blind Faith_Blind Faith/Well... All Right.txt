Well... All Right LyricsWell, alright, so I've been foolish
Well, alright, let people know
'Bout the dreams and wishes that you dream
In the night when lights are low
Well, alright, well, alright
You know we'll live and love with all our might
Well, alright, well, alright
You know our lifetime love will be alright
Ooohooohooo
Ooohooohooo
Ooohooohooo
Well, alright, so I'm not working
Well, alright, let people say
That those foolish kids can't be ready
For the love that comes their way
Well, alright, well, alright
You know we'll live and love with all our might
Well, alright, well, alright
You know our lifetime love will be alright
Ooohooohooo
Ooohooohooo
Ooohooohooo
Well, alright, so I've been foolish
Well, alright, let people know
'Bout the dreams and wishes that you dream
In the night when lights are low
Well, alright, well, alright
You know we'll live and love with all our might
Well, alright, well, alright
You know our lifetime love will be alright
