Presence of the Lord LyricsI have finally found a way to live just like I never could before
I know that I don't have much to give, but I can open any door
Everybody knows the secret, everybody knows the score
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I have finally found a way to live in the colour of the Lord
I have finally found a place to live just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give, but soon I'll open any door
Everybody knows the secret, everybody knows the score
I have finally found a place to live, oh, in the presence of the Lord
In the presence of the Lord
I have finally found a way to live, just like I never could before
And I know I don't have much to give, but I can open any door
Everybody knows the secret, I said everybody knows the score
I have finally found a way to live in the colour of the Lord
In the colour of the LordEmbed
