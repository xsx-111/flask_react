Do What You Like LyricsDo right, use your head, everybody must be fed
Get together, break your bread, yes, together, that's what I said
Do what you like
Don't fight
Don't fight, use your head, it's all right every night
Do what you like, that's what I said
Everybody must be fed, do what you like
Open your eyes, realize you're not dead
Take a look at an open book
Do what you like, that's what I said, do what you like
Do what you like
Do right, use your head, everybody must be fed
Get together, break some bread, yes together, that's what I said
Do what you like
Open your eyes, use your head, realize that you're not dead
Take a look at an open book, let it cook
That's what I said, do what you likeEmbed
