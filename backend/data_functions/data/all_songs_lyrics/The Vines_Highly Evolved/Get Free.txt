Get Free Lyrics
I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
Ride into the sun
She never loved me
She never loved me
She never loved me
Why should anyone?
(Come here, come here, come here)
I'll take your photo for ya
(Come here, come here, come here)
Drive you around the corner
(Come here, come here, come here)
You know you really oughta
(Come here, come here, come here)
Move outta California

Get (Get)
Me (Me)
Far (Far)
When I've a lot to lose
Save (Save)
Me (Me)
From (From)
Here
(Come here, come here, come here)
(Come here, come here, come here)
(Come here, come here, come here)
(Come here, come here, come here)
When it's breeding time
Look into your mind away

I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
I'm gonna get free
Ride into the sun
She never loved me
She never loved me
She never loved me
Why should anyone?
(Come here, come here, come here)
I'll take your photo for ya
(Come here, come here, come here)
Drive you around the corner
(Come here, come here, come here)
You know you really oughta
(Come here, come here, come here)
Move outta CaliforniaEmbed
