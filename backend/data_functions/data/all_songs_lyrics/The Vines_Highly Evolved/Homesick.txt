Homesick LyricsI left my home
I left my home yeah yeah
Where I should go
Where I should go yeah yeah
Nothing's gonna save you
Nothing's gonna save you out there
Went on my own
Went on my own yeah yeah
Without my phone
Without my phone yeah yeah
Nothing's gonna save you
Nothing's gonna save you out there
Nothing's gonna save you
Nothing's gonna save you or give
I can see the leaves of golden glisten in the sun
Making time for everyone is what I should have done
Blue and green with eyes between are acting all the same
You and me are never free until we're cast away
But it really doesn't matter
Couldn't change it if I tried
Though it really doesn't matter
I'll do it till I get it right
Nothing's going to save you
Nothing's going to save you out thereEmbed
