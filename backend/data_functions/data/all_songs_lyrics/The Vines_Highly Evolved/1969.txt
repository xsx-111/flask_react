1969 LyricsIt's 1969 in my head
I just wanna have no place to go
Livin' through the sound of the dead
I'm gonna get stoned look around in my soul
I'm hearin' voices in the trees
And seein' footsteps in the rain
I just wanna die before I lose my dol
I have been cryin' in my sleep
Cause I don't know where I have been
I just wanna live to see another day
Hey hey hey hey
When I get my buick six
I'll see my life drop in that whirlpool
If I get to see you again
You're the only one I know
Here we go
There I stand
I'm a seed
Of a man
Dare I go
Dare I stare
I'm a seed
Of a manEmbed
