Factory LyricsDays are long but the minds are strong
In the factory
Heads are down and all the people frown
In the factory
I'm so down I put my head around
Every noose I see
Days are long but the minds are strong
In the factory
Eyes are mean but the walls are clean
In the factory
Patience now they're gonna string you out
In the factory
I'm so tired I never go outside
Every night I sleep
Days are long but the minds are gone
In the factoryEmbed
