In the Jungle LyricsIn the jungle you can sleep
With the commandments at your feet
Where the devil lays his hand
You don't even need to think
I'm tearin' holes without a sink
But I know just where I stand
Lines from the story
You put before me
I don't know what to choose
Under the oak tree
Tin all around me
I don't know what to prove
Yeah
She
Felt
You
Felt
Like
Hell
In the jungle
You're in the jungle
You're in the jungle
That's you
In the jungle
You're in the jungle
You're in the jungle
And I'll be waitin' for a hit yeah
Ain't gonna seem fair tonight
And I'll keep havin' other fits yeah
Because it makes me feel alright
Alright alright
Oh yeah
Right
Oh yeah
So if you should need a hand
Write down the address of the land
But I'm runnin' out of time
Under the oak tree
Tin all around me
I don't know what to prove
Lines from the story
You put before me
?
Under the oak tree
Tin all around me
?
In the jungle
You're in the jungle
You're in the jungle
I'll tell you when it's time to leave
In the jungle
You're in the jungle
You're in the jungle
I'll tell you when it's time to leave
You're never gonna get clean
In the jungle
You're in the jungle
You're in the jungleEmbed
