Highly Evolved Lyrics
I'm feeling happy, so highly evolved
My time's a riddle that will never be solved
Dreamin' for somethin', reachin' for somethin'
Just waitin' for the sun to carry me in

If you feel low
You can buy love
From a payphone
I don't feel low

My brother Bill, he work for the market
Love is an arrow, all I need is a target
Dreamin' for somethin', reachin' for somethin'
Just waitin' for the sun to carry me in

If you feel low
You can buy love
From a payphone
I don't feel low
Highly evolved
Highly evolved
Highly evolved
Highly evolved

I don't feel low
Highly evolvedEmbed
