Country Yard LyricsI'm tired of feelin' sick and useless
Then speakin' every other way
Gluin' my eyes together girl
Might be the right escape
There's nothin' in the secret garden
Just images of blue and white
Losin' my mind forever girl
May be the only sign
Down in a country yard
I was taken by the shadows
Although we couldn't see that far
I was dreamin' of tomorrow
I really don't need a change
I really don't need what's mine
Out in a country yard
It'll be just fineEmbed
