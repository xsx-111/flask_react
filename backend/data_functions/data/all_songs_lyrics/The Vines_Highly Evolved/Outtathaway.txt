Outtathaway LyricsWell, I'm fuckin' allowed!
I get
What I own don't let
The feelings that I choose
'Cause everybody else do
Gotta get outtathaway
No time for me to say
Everyone in the world don't affect you
We think
You're a lot different
Your number ain't your thing
You're always on the wrong end
Gotta get outtathaway
No time for me to say
Everyone in the world don't affect you
Now come on
Gotta get outtathaway
No time for me to say
When I speak out of line
I don't believe in time1Embed
