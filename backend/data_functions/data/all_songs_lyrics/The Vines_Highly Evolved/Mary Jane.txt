Mary Jane LyricsMary Jane said
Life's a wait
I already knew
Because we're down
We'll lose the town
Just like I would choose
Mary Jane said
Minds are games
I went to the moon
Before we know
She'll have to go
Wish I were there too
But I've got to go
Mary Jane
Mary says
I I can love you
Life's a wait
Why why should I lose
When I've got to go
Mary JaneEmbed
