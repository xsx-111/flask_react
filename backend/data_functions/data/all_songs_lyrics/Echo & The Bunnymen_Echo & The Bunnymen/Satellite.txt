Satellite LyricsMoonlight. starlight
Insight out of sight
Something's certain
Draw the curtains draw them
Take the night
When it calls
Take the night
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
You will I might
Talking satellites
Rockets comets
Something's coming
Take the night
When it calls
Take the night
When it falls
When it falls
Take the night
When it falls
Out out All out
In doubt Far out
Wheels in motion
Take it take it take it the potion
Take the night
When it calls
Take the night
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
Moonlight
Starlight
Insight
Out of sight
Take the night
When it calls
Take the night
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
When it falls
When the night falls
It falls
It falls
It falls
It falls
It fallsEmbed
