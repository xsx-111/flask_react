Bombers Bay LyricsThe word went round
In no-dream town
They shut us up
And shut us down
The planes flew in
And laid the ground
We built upon
And spun around
God's one miracle
Lost in circles
On the march
Berlin to Bombers Bay
Traveling dark
On the road to Mandalay
Cannon fired
Came to call
Stood us up
And watched us fall
The way we were
And now outworn
Our costumes changed
To uniforms
Black black days
Here to stay
On the march
Madrid to Bombers Bay
Traveling dark
On the road to Mandalay
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Smile boys that's the style
Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
Smile
They give us hope
And teach us well
With magic moons
That cast a spell
And hypnotize
And draw us in
I believe
I'm believing
God's one miracle
Moves in circles
On the march
Berlin to Bombers Bay
Traveling dark
On the road
On the march
Berlin to Bombers Bay
Traveling dark
On the road to Mandalay
Black black days
Where the flying fishes play
Black black days
Where the flying fishes play
Black black days
Where the flying fishes play
Black black days
Where the flying fishes play...Embed
