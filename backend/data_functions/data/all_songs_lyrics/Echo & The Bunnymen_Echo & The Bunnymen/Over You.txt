Over You LyricsJump right in
Take the call
Were you pushed
Or did you fall?
Fell apart
Feeling low
Happy ride
The merry-go
And I always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
But my chiming bells are ringing out
The word the word the word
Love rebounds
Heart goes snap
Is she ever
Coming back?
Let her down
Break her fall
Never ever
Felt so small
And I always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
And my chiming bells are ringing out
The word the word the word
Feeling good again
Always hoped I would
Never believed
That I ever could
Feeling blue again
Never wanted to
Under the weather
And it's over you
Over you (the hole in the holy)
(And the crack in our hearts)
Over you (it's love and love only)
(That sets our world apart)
Over you (worlds apart)
(Joined at the heart)
Jump right in
Take the call
Were you pushed
Or did you fall?
Fell apart
Feeling low
Happy ride
The merry-go
And I always hear them singing
And complaining about the world
And my chiming bells are ringing out
The word the word the word
Feeling good again
Always hoped I would
Never believed
That I ever could
Feeling blue again
Never wanted to
Under the weather
And it's over you
Over you (the hole in the holy)
(And the crack in our hearts)
Over you (it's love and love only)
(The sets our worlds apart)
Feeling good again
Always hoped I would
Never believed
That I ever could
Feeling blue again
Never wanted to
Under the weather
And it's over you
Over you (and a dream is a means)
(To an end of the things)
Over you (that will tempt you away)
(From the path to the true way in)
Feeling good again
Always hoped I would
Never believed
That I ever could
Feeling blue again
Never wanted to
Under the weather
And it's over you
Over you
Over youEmbed
