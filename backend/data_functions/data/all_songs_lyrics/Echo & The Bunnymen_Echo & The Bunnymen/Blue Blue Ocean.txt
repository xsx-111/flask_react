Blue Blue Ocean LyricsOne in a million
One and the same
Looking for freedom
Born to be tamed
Once in a lifetime
One of these days
Gonna grab me a lifeline
Swinging my way
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping
He's gonna pick the bones of you and me
You and me
Hearts of fire
Hearts of bone
Beating stronger
Beating home
Where there's wanting
There is need
Where there's having
There is greed
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping
He's gonna pick the bones of you and me
You and me
Girl
I want the gold dust
In your fingers
And your Klondike touch
Girl
I want the goldmine
As it shimmers
In your solemn eyes
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea
Silhouettes and a vulture hoping
Licking the bones of you and me
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
You're sailing out on a blue blue sea
Blue blue sea
I'm swimming out on an ocean
(Blue blue ocean)
You're sailing out on the sea
(Blue blue sea)
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
(Blue blue ocean)
You're sailing out on a blue sea
(Blue blue sea)
I'm swimming out on an ocean
(Blue blue ocean)
You're sailing out on the sea
(Blue blue sea)
I'm swimming out on a blue blue ocean
(Blue blue ocean)
You're sailing out on a blue sea
(Blue blue sea)
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
Blue blue sea
Blue blue ocean
