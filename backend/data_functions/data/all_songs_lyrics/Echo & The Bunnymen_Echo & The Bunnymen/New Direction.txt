New Direction Lyrics
Out on a limb
Did you see what the cat dragged in?
Take it on the chin
Catching fire on a roof of tin
You've learnt to speak and you're professing
The right to teach us our direction
But I found out on close inspection
True imperfection

I'm looking for a new direction
Where in the world am I?
I took the word, the word was resurrection
Then you took me out to climb

Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Kissing the spires
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Souls on fire
Inside of my head
I heard what the good Lord said
"Beware", he said
"If you don't you might end up dead"
You suck the air right out of me
But though you suck you cannot see
That life and living is not free
Though you live you do not breathe

I'm looking for a new direction
Where in the world am I?
I took the word the word was resurrection
And then you took me out to climb

Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Kissing the spires
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Souls on fire
I have changed
But still my heart
Remains intact
And true love stays
But will our hearts
Retain their lack of

No sense and no direction
Who in the world am I?
I took the word the word was resurrection
And then you took me out to climb

Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Kissing the spires
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Higher and higher
Souls on fire

Start confessing
Start confessing

All my evils would be blessed
If to God I did confess
Wipe the slate and see if I
Ate the bread and drank the wine
So as you're leaving I take possession
Just take the bottle and start confessingEmbed
