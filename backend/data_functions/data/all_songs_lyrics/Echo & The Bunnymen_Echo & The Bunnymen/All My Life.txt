All My Life LyricsOh how the times have changed us
Sure and now uncertain
Men not devils have claimed us
Purity deserting
God's one miracle
Lost in circles
All my all my life
Revolves around
Laughter and crying
As my life turns
Round and round
Cannon fire burning
On the hillside
You and I are side by side
Listen
Tin soldiers playing our tune
All my all my life
Revolves around
Laughter and crying
As my life turns
Round and round and round
Songs for life's lost lovers
Bitter sweet their healing
Their prayers prayed under covers
Need not kneeling
God's one miracle
Moves in circles
All my all my life
Revolves around
Laughter and crying
As my life turns
Round and round
All my all my life
Revolves around
Laughter and crying
As my life turns
Round and round
And round
And roundEmbed
