The Game LyricsA sense of duty was my one intention
And an ugly beauty was my own invention
Pride, a proud refusal
And I refuse to need your approval
Too many seekers, too few beacons
But through the fog we'll keep on beaming
Through the crying hours of your glitter years
All the living out of your tinsel tears
And the midnight trains I never made
'Cause I'd already played the game
Everybody's got their own good reason
Why their favorite season is their favorite season
Winter winners and those summer sons
Aren't good for everyone, aren't good for everyone
Spring has sprung and autumn's so well done, so well done
And it's a better thing that we do now
Forgetting everything, the whys and hows
While you reminisce about the things you miss
You won't be ready to kiss goodbye
The earth is a world, the world is a ball
A ball in a game with no rules at all
And just as I wonder at the beauty of it all
You go and drop it and it breaks and falls
I'll never understand why you thought I would
Need to be reassured and be understood
When I always knew your bad's my good
And I was ready, ready to be loved
Born under Mars
With Jupiter rising
Fallen from stars
That lit my horizon
I'll never understand why you thought I would
Need to be reassured and be understood
When I always knew your bad's my good
And I was ready to be
Through the crying hours of your glitter years
All the living out of your tinsel tears
And the midnight trains I never made
'Cause I'd already played
It's a better thing that we do now
Forgetting everything, the whys and hows
While you reminisce about the things you miss
You won't be ready to kiss goodbyeEmbed
