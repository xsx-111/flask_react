Lost and Found LyricsI was standing in a graveyard
Under silver studded skies
In a forest burning ashes
On the bonfires of our lives
As the sky fell down
I was lost and found
Saw my world spin round
Round and round
All the ghosts have gathered round me
Come to tell me of a change
In the darkness that surrounds me
I am falling down again
On this haunted ground
I am lost and found
Lost
Lost and found
Lost
Lost and found
She will tell you her cathedral
Has no windows and no doors
And you know she doesn't need you
And that's why you want her more
As your heart melts down
You are lost not found
Lost
Lost and found
Lost
Lost and found
I was counting all the tombstones
Of the buried boys and girls
As the wind blew in like ice
And froze this cemetery world
And we all fell down
We were lost and found
Lost
Lost and found
Lost
Lost and foundEmbed
