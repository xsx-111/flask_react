Lorelei LyricsAt the Lorelei
Sing it sweet for me tonight
All my dreams to long tonight
If only i could be the one
Hold on tight I need ya son
Wouldn't even fire the gun
If only I could be
Tie your heart and soul
To the lightning pole
Still it ain't no guarantee
In the firing line
Find your eyes aren't blind Pretty soon i'm free
At the Lorelei
Sing it sweet for me tonight
All my dreams to long tonight
If only i could be the one
Oh my god I need ya son
I won't ever let ya down
If only It could be
Through the carnage thorn
With your face like stone
Till there ain't no dignity
Pretty soon i'm free
At the Lorelei
Sing it sweet for me tonight
All my dreams to long denied
If only i could be the way
Say those things we used to say
Sometime was back yesterday
If only It could be
If only It could be
If only It could beEmbed
