Freedom LyricsTake your eyes off me
There's nothing here to see
Trying to keep my head together
And as we make our vow
Let us remember how
There's nothing good that lasts forever
Time out on the running boards
We're running
Through a world that lost its meaning
Trying to find a way to love
This running
Ain't no kind of freedom
Feel the touch of grief
You stand in disbelief
Can steal the earth from right beneath you
And falling in so far
They know just where you are
Yeah but there ain't no way to reach you
Time out on the running boards
We're running
Through a world that lost its meaning
Trying to find a way to love
This running
Ain't no kind of freedom
Of freedom
Yeah, yeah
It's time to clean these boats
Fold up these parachutes
The words goodbye but I can't say it
The end is close at hand
I think we understand
There ain't no use trying to delay it
Time out on the running boards
We're running
Through a world that lost its meaning
Trying to find a way to love
This running
Ain't no kind of freedom
Freedom, freedom
Time out on the running boards
We're running
Through a world that lost its meaning
Trying to find a way to love
This running
Ain't no kind of freedom
Of freedom
Freedom
Time out on the running boards
We're running
Through a world that lost its meaning
Trying to find a way to love
This running
Ain't no kind of freedom
Fasten on my mask
I'm bending to the task
I know this work is never finished
And if I close my eyes
I can still see you dancing
Laughing loud and undiminishedEmbed
