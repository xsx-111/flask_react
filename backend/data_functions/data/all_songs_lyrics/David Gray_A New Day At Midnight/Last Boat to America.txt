Last Boat to America LyricsMake me a boat, away I'll float
Into the stillness of a pure blue sky
There's nothing here to hold me now
And I got no more tears to cry
Grant me a wish, just one more kiss
And baby kiss me 'til the daylight's through
These are days of make believe
There ain't nothing any fool can do
Pin another dream on me
'Cause the night is bearing down
Baby let's go all the way this time
Sing me the truth sweet bird of youth
I got some trouble tryin'a understand
Beneath the veils of mystery
Are these the movements of an unseen hand
Our arms are filled with sunken treasure
Our heads are filled with perfect sound
Do we truly see it, hey
'Til we're placing it in the ground
Take just what you need from me
'Cause the night is bearing down
Baby let's go all the way this time
Frost on my windowpane is forming
Don't pin that line on me, oh now
Don't pin that line on me, oh not now
Don't pin that line on me, oh now
Don't pin that line on me, oh not now
Baby let's go all the way this time
Won't you take me all the way this time
Baby let's go all the way this time
Make me a boat, away I'll float
Into the stillness of a pure blue skyEmbed
