Long Distance Call LyricsIf I lean my weight on it
If I fix my heart to the line
Might find a way from it
To some easy time
My skin's all white with it
I'm up so high when I fall
I fall so far from it
Ain't nowhere at all
Early morning sun
Shine it and I'm gone
To plane out on the lake
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
To glide out on the wing
Turn around and sing
The fear now taking hold
I'll bring you love but it's all been sold
My heads all wired with it
My tongue gets tied when I speak
The space inside roaring
When that signal break
Early morning sun
Shine it and I'm gone
To plane out on the lake
Hey, hey, yeah, yeah
To glide out on the wing
Turn around and see
The fire now taking hold
I'll bring you love but it's all been soldEmbed
