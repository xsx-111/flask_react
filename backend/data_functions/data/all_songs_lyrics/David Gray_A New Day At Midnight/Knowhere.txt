Knowhere LyricsSlow voices speaking through a hurricane
Said that I wanted but I lied
You're looking good
Hey man I can't complain
Ghost on the road at night
Seen him out walking he's just skin and bone
I don't see nothing in her eyes
Some call it hell
Felt like a home from home
I'm dreaming different skies
I don't know where I
I don't know what I'm
Supposed to do now
Get it on all night
I don't know where I
I don't know what I
It seems to me boy
That you're doing all right
I don't know what I
I don't know where I
Long way to go now
Keep it all inside
36 hours but my mind is fresh
Live for the moment then I'm gone
Suck on that sympathy and feel the rush
Go on my blue eyed son
I don't know where I
I don't know what I'm
Supposed to do now
Get it on all night
I don't know where I
I don't know what I
It seems to me boy
That you're doing all right
I don't know where I
I tell you what I
Long way to go now
Keep it all inside
I don't know where I
I don't know what I'm
Supposed to do now
Get it on all night
I don't know where I
I don't know what I
It seems to me boy
That you're doing all right
I don't know what I
I don't know where I
Long way to go now
Keep it all insideEmbed
