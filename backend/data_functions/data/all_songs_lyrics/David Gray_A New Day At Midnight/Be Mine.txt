Be Mine LyricsFrom the very first moment I saw you
That's when I knew
All the dreams I held in my heart
Had suddenly come true
Knock me over stone cold sober
Not a thing I could say or do
'Cos baby when I'm walking with you now
My eyes are so wide
Like you reached right into my head
And turned on the light inside
Turning on the light
Inside my mind hey
Come on baby it's all right
Sunday, Monday, day or night
Written blue on white it's plain to see
(Be my, be my)
That rainy, shiny, night or day
What's the difference anyway
Honey till your heart belongs to me
If I had some influence girl
With the powers that be
I'd have them fire that arrow at you
Like they fired it right at me
And maybe when your heart and soul are burning
You might see
That every time I'm talking with you
It's always over too soon
That everyday feels so incomplete
Till you walk into the room
Say the word now girl
I'll jump that moon hey
Come on baby it's ok
Rainy, shiny, night or day
There's nothing in the way now
Don't you see?
(Be my, be my)
Winter, summer, day or night
Centigrade or Fahrenheit
Baby till your heart belongs to me
(Be my, be my)
Thursday, Friday, short or long
When you got a love so strong
How can it be wrong now mercy me?
(Be my, be my)
Jumpin' Jesus, holy cow!
What's the difference anyhow?
Baby till your heart belongs to meEmbed
