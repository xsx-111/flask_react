Caroline LyricsCaroline
Those crazy eyes that shine
The days blowing through my mind
Like falling leaves
It ain't no good
I tried hard as I could
But you just won't let
My poor heart be
The final war
A steel eyed dinosaur
Girl I want you more
Than I can say
But Caroline
It seems like every time
Honey all I get is further away
The state I'm in
Got goosebumps on my skin
See the water I'll jump right in
Your heart so free
I'll face the facts
It's paper on the cracks
Girl till I got you right
Back here with me
The final war
A steel eyed dinosaur
Girl I need you more
Than I can say
Ah but Caroline
It seems like every time
Honey all I get is further away
Honey all I get is further away
Wooooo!
The final war
A steel eyed dinosaur
Girl I want you more
Than I can say
Ah but Caroline
It seems like every time
Honey all I get is further away
Honey all I get is further
And further
And further awayEmbed
