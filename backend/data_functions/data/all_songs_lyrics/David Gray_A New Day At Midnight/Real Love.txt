Real Love LyricsThe dawn in all its majesty
Is stealing me away
The dawn in all its honesty
Is turning me to clay
And through the bars of iron rain
Way beyond and back again
I hear the voice of Eden cry
Lift me up I'm walking on high
It's real love
Real love
This world in all its clarity
Is glorious, is fake
This world in all its vanity
Is more than I can take
And down the road the iron wheels
Chain my heart to how it feels
I hear the voice of Eden cry
Lift me up I'm walking on high
It's real love
Real love
Itâ€™s real love
Real love
Make it real
Make it real
Real love now
And something in the heart of me
Is telling me it's time
To meet the eye of destiny
And leave it all behind
And through my bones an iron rage
Paints my soul upon the page
I hear the voice of Eden cry
Lift me up to walk on high
Makes me wanna lay down and die
It's real love
Real love
Real love
Real love
The dawn in all its majesty
Is stealing me awayEmbed
