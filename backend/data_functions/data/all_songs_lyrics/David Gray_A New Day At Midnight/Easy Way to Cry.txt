Easy Way to Cry LyricsSmoke curls through my hands
These one night stands
Are making me crazy I know
Morning I'll go
Crowds in the rain all passing by
Faith gone from your eyes
Each word that flies
Taking you further away
And come that day
There ain't no easy way to cry
And as I watch you leave I stand
Inside my house of straw
And everywhere I go I find
Things recollecting to my mind
How right it all could be
Faith gone from your eyes
Each word it flies
Straight to the heart and I know
Watching you go
There ain't no easy way to cry
So right now
So right now
So right
And as I watch you leave I stand
Inside my house of straw
And everywhere I go I find
Things recollecting to my mind
How right it all could be
Could be
So right now
So right now
So right now
So right now
So right now
So right now
So right
So rightEmbed
