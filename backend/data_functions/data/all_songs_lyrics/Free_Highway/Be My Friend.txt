Be My Friend LyricsMmm, mmm, mmm
All I need, is a friend
Someone to give me, a helpin' hand
When I'm afraid, in the night
Someone to squeeze me
And tell me, it's all right
You know I worry, huh, such a lot
I would give, all I've got
Just to have, someone believe in me
Just to do that, and put me back on evenly
Baby, baby, be my friend
Baby, baby, be my friend
Baby, baby, be my friend
I will love you, till the very end
Whoa, oh, ooh, listen...
You make me feel, a stronger love
Than anyone, I've ever known
Oh I need, someone like you
You give me something, so strong and true
Oh, baby, baby, be my friend
Baby, baby, be my friend (yeah yeah)
Baby, baby, be my friend (yeah)
I will love you, till the very end
Won't ya, won't ya, baby, baby, baby, baby, be my friend
I will love ya, I will love ya, till the very end
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, be my friend
I will love you, love you till the very end
Oh, baby, baby, be my friend
I got to love you, love you, till the very end
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh…
Baby, baby, baby, baby I will love you
I need your loving baby
I will love you, I need you, oh…Embed
