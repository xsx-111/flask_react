Contact Lyrics
I've got a lump in my throat
About the note you wrote
I'd come on over
But I haven't got a raincoat

Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?

I've got contacts in my book
And in my eyes
My good connection
On the telephone never lies

Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?

I've got a list of the people
I have known
I'm never alone
On the end of a phone
Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?

I've got a lump in my throat
About the note you wrote
I'd come on over
But I haven't got a raincoat
I'd come on over
But I haven't got a raincoat

Have we got contact
You and me?
Have we got touchdown
Can't we be?Embed
