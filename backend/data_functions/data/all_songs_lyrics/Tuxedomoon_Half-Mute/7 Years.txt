7 Years LyricsNow you're lonely, I'm feeling strained
Friends just talking and walking away
He don't even smile at you
And you don't want another day
Then you end up with 7 years
7 years in one night
7 years in one night
Sit in your chair, you sit and stare
Think about moving, but you don't do it
'Cause thinking about it, is just enough
You start dreaming, your eyes wide open
After a while, you open your eyes
Realize you ain't been sleeping
'Cause 7 years have just gone by
7 years in one night
7 years in one night
7 years in one night
7 years in one night
