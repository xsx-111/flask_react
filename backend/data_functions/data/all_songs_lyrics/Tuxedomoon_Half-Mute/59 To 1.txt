59 To 1 LyricsIt's 59 to 1 against you
It's 59 to 1 against me
59 seconds of everyone
59 seconds of everyone
59 seconds of every one minute
59 seconds of everyone
59 seconds of everyone
59 seconds of everyone of misery

So you don't go out much any more?
Yeah, oh yeah, how much?
Well, I couldn't do it all, I could do maybe ten
No I don't work, I don't want to get a job, you kidding?
Look there's two reasons why people work
One, to take their minds off the frightening possibility
Of what they would do with all their free time
If they weren't working
And two to buy enough things to keep their minds
Off the frightening possibility
Of what they do if they weren't working
Yeah, okay, we'll have to rendezvous somewhere
Well, hey, I hardly even know you man
Right, okay, see you later
