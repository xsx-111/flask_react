What Use LyricsWhat's the use
Of feeling betrayed
What's the use
Of feeling at all
I'm pacing the floor
I'm wearing it smooth
This is stupid
I think I'll go home
What's the use
Of moving uptown
Flying to Rome
On your credit card
An endless parade
Of lawyers of finance
Plenty of time
With nothing to do
Give me new noise
Give me new affection
Strange new toys
From another world
I need to see more
Than just three dimensions
Stranger than fiction
Faster than light1Embed
