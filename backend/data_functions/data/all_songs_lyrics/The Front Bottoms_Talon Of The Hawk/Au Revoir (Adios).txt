Au Revoir (Adios) Lyrics
You know what I think's really sad?
I know how really sad you are
I'm probably gonna leave real soon
Just wanted to let you know

Before I say au revoir, au revoir
You probably don't even know what that means
Au revoir, au revoir
You probably don't even know what that means

She says that it's Frenchâ€”"I know what it means
You don't have to be so mean
If you wanna leave, why don't you go?"
Right before she walks away
I'm pretty sure I hear her say

"Adios, adios
I bet you think I don't know what that means
Adios, adios
I bet you think I don't know what that means"
Rock and roll, rock and roll
You probably don't understand what I mean
Rock and roll, rock and roll
You probably don't understand what I mean
Au revoir, au revoir
You probably don't understand what I mean
Au revoir, au revoir
You probably don't even know what that means
(Ooh, la la)
She says that it's French
I know what it means
Just thought I should let you know
Before I say au revoir4Embed
