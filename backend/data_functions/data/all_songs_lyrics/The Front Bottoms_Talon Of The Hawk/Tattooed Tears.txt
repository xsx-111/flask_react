Tattooed Tears Lyrics
You should know that you don't kick if you don't have to
All’s fair in love and war, I know, don't get me wrong
But if you listen to your heart, it may mislead you
Lord, I should know; I have felt lost for so long

You had me go from what I thought was sliding carefully
To seriously slipping out of control

But I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
It’s not like a movie when we kiss
There’ll never be no music when we kiss
And I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
Convenient, ah, convenient

I hear her whisper, "All I want is to want nothing"
The room is dark, and I’m pretty sure she thinks I’m asleep
She says, "It just don't make no sense. Why can't it work out in my head?
Why I can't be happy—there's definitely reasons I should be”
She says that "I, for one, will not be held
Responsible for someone else"
I gotta go

But I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
It’s not like a movie when we kiss
There’ll never be no music when we kiss
And I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
Convenient, ah, convenient

Let’s talk about how it felt on my shoulders
As it came pouring out my ears
Let’s talk about the face of our love
And how it might look with the addition of tattooed tears
Let’s talk about the torn-up skin on my fingers
Right where it meets my fingernails
Let’s talk about how what you call "sliding carefully"
Is seriously slipping out of control
But I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
It’s not like a movie when we kiss
There’ll never be no music when we kiss
And I’m gonna have to learn
That this love will never be convenient
Convenient, ah, convenient5Embed
