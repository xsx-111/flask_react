Santa Monica Lyrics
Sometimes, I cry when I get sad
I guess it's true what they say

Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional man, emotional man
I am emotional

I wish we were forever lying on the Santa Monica beach
Drinking Tecate 24-ounces underneath the stars
Being the superior couple
Loving who I am 'cause what we are

I wanna confess it in a whisper that's just loud enough to make out
I want you to listen from the kitchen to me confessing on the couch
I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom
I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom

Where I'm standing, there is a cool, cool breeze
Heavenly bodies make the Devil a little uncomfortable
I guess there are some things I was just born to be
Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional man, emotional man
I am emotional

It's such a big city, I feel so stupid
Thinking I might see you if I wander around
If I do the things we used to do together
If we were on the same level, you'd be doing 'em as well
There's something about drowning I can't shake
Or someone dying anyway

I wanna confess it in a whisper that's just loud enough to make out
I want you to listen from the kitchen to me confessing on the couch
I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom
I wanna be stronger than your dad was for your mom

From where I'm standing, there is a cool, cool breeze
From where I'm standing, there is a cool, cool breeze

Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional baby boy, emotional man
Emotional man, emotional man
I am emotional4Embed
