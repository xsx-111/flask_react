Everything I Own Lyrics
Sometimes you get sad when we're together
Because you're not sure if you'll miss me when I'm gone
Just try to appreciate what you got while you got it
So if it ever goes away, you can say you enjoyed it while it lasted

Sometimes I don't feel like singing
I don't really like these songs
Sometimes I don't feel like dancing
DJ please, don't turn the beat on
Let's keep it quiet, keep me honest, keep me true
Keep me in love, keep me believing it's with you

But who's gonna push my wheelchair around when I get sick?
God forbid I ever stop feeling sorry for myself for being selfish
This is not the way I plan on living for the rest of my life
But for right now, it gets me by
It gets me by

It's reached the point in the night where I need to decide
Whether I'm gonna fall asleep or watch the sunrise
We are both into letting this develop
But the thought of starting over always sounded much better
But I won't stop this and you won't stop this
It'll probably go further than either of us wanted
And it all comes down to the fact that I don't care to
Sacrifice a good time 'cause someone says I have to
The next thing that I know, I am removing all my clothes
And you are dancing around the room to some song on the radio
You say I deserve it, all that is coming, the good and the bad, bad, bad, bad
I don't regret it, how could I? You were the best I ever had
I ever had, I ever had, I ever had, I everâ€”

But who's gonna push my wheelchair around when I get sick?
God forbid I ever stop feeling sorry for myself for being selfish
This is not the way I plan on living for the rest of my life
But for right now, it gets me by
It gets me by1Embed
