Lone Star Lyrics
Goodbye future, once so bright
Meet my pregnant girlfriend
Watch my bank account run dry
Four hundred thirty-seven dollars spent
To put things back to the way they used to be
Still, I woulda spent so much more
But four hundred thirty-seven dollars somehow shakes all responsibility
But it's not easy

She looks me dead in the eyes and says, "Hey, Brian
If you still believe in the Lord above
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us"

The past few months were pretty rough
A couple times, wished we both were dead
I never cried like that before
I thought my eyes would pop out of my head
Not just preparing for nightmares
Years and years I do suppose
Nothing feels alright now
The length of my hair or the fit of my clothes
And crying like a baby solved nothing
'Cause I can leave, so what, now what, so where do I go?
'Cause I could imagine myself throwing all my clothes inside a suitcase
Without bothering to fold them
'Cause I could imagine myself throwing all my things inside a suitcase
Without bothering to fold them

She looked me dead in the eyes and said, "Hey, Brian
If you still believe in the Lord above
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us
Get on your hands and knees and pray for us"

Because freshness is expected from any hip-hop artist
I avoid using traditional techniques
I avoid using traditional techniques
Techniques
Techniques, techniques, techniques, techniques, techniques4Embed
