The Feud Lyrics
I was so bored before I met you
But then I met you, and everything changed
And now, it seems I can be amused
And in the littlest things, I find so much my truth

She says, "You
You should admit it"
She knows I
I probably won't
That he's
The sound you want now
And I'm
Just the noise you don't
And I'm just saying, it's a bummer, man
I'm sorry for interrupting, I guess I'll go

You were my girl, you were my baby
You were my homemade mashed potatoes, biscuits, and gravy
You were too good, I should have known
You were a prize my hands could never hold

She says, "You
You should admit it"
She knows I
I probably won't
That he
Is the sound you want now
And I
I'm just the noise you don't
And I'm just saying, it's a bummer, man
I'm sorry for interrupting, I guess I'll go
And she says, "Tell me
What I need to hear
What I wanna hear
Or else!"
I call her "baby"
I ask her to sit down
Ask her to sit down
And allow me to try to explain myself

She says, "You, you, you
Should probably admit it
Probably admit it, probably"
But I, I, I
I probably won't
Probably won't, probably
That he, he, he
He's the sound you want now
The sound you want now, sound
And I, I, I
Am the noise you don't
The noise you don't, noise you
And I, I, I
Should probably admit it
Probably admit it, probably
But I, I, I
I probably won't
Probably won't, probably
That he, he, he
He's the sound you want now
The sound you want now, sound
And I, I, I
Am the noise you don't
The noise you don't
And I'm just saying, it's a bummer, man
Sorry for interrupting, I guess I'll go
I guess I'll go
I guess I'll goEmbed
