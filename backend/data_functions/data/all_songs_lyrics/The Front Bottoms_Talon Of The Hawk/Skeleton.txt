Skeleton Lyrics
I walk around like a skeleton last night
Trying to find my way home
This white frame, it’s all that I’ve got left
'Cause not even you could chew through my bones
I’ve got very strong bones

I walk around like a skeleton last night, confused and alone
Who was I kidding? I can't get past you
You are the cops, you are my student loans
You are a head-shaped hole in a sheetrock wall
You are the pain I feel, you are the stud in the wall
Better than nothing at all

And I got so stoned, I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat, I’m too tall
But I got so stoned, I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat, I’m too tall
But I got so stoned

Come on, baby, calm me down
You’re the only one who knows how
Reunited and it feels so good
It’s so much better than I thought it would
'Cause I feel fucked, but in a good way
I start to cough, taste the butane
And I can tell that he’s asking her yes-or-no questions
By the way she’s shaking her head
From left to right and then up and down
And then left to right again

I'm gonna go get so stoned, I fall asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat, I’m too tall
But I got so stoned, I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat, I’m too tall
But I got so stoned

Come on, baby, calm me down
You’re the only one who knows how
I got miles to go 'til I ever get home
But the sound of your laugh and your voice on the phone
Makes me feel like I am already there

I got so stoned, I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat, I’m too tall
But I got so stoned, I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat, I’m too tall
But I got so stoned, I fell asleep in the front seat
I never sleep in the front seat, I’m too tall
But I got so stoned4Embed
