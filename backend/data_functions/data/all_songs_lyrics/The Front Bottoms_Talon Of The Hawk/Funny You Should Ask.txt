Funny You Should Ask Lyrics
The good thing about this cast is I can still hold a knife
So if you ever twist my arm again, I'll be sure to put up a fight
You see, I just don't wanna do the things that you want me to do
But I'm a sucker, so I do them, 'cause I am still in love with you

She said, "Honey, you gotta learn that love is simple, just like mud
If you play the dirt, then I'll play the water—all we gotta do is touch"

'Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anything
But I'm older now and know that I should
'Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anything
But I'm older now and know that I should

It is freezing
And I am watching you shovel snow
Off a driveway
Across from my parent's home
Now it's summer (Now it's summer)
And you are laying out on your lawn
You look so sexy, Chelsea
With your polka-dot bikini on
Come on, Chelsea, speak a little French to me
Heard you spent two whole semesters drinking wine
While I was stuck in Jersey, trying to save some money
I guess I'm just another thing you left behind

But you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
But you're older now and wish that you could
'Cause you were young, you thought you didn't have to care about anyone
But you're older now and know that you should

It's funny you should ask
'Cause I don't remember
It's funny you should ask
I could've been a contender

One, two three! (Three) Everyone, say, "Cheese!" (Cheese)
Thought you got the best of me—turns out it was a video
Me and my best friend, me and my cousins
Sitting there smiling—turns out it was a video

But I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anyone
But I'm older now and know that I should
'Cause I was young, I thought I didn't have to care about anyone
But I'm older now and know that I should
It's funny you should ask
'Cause I don't remember
It's funny you should ask
I coulda been a contender
It's funny you should ask
(Thought I didn't have to care about anything)
No, I will not surrender
(Thought I didn't have to care about anything)
It's funny you should ask
(Thought I didn't have to care about anything)
'Cause I don't remember4Embed
