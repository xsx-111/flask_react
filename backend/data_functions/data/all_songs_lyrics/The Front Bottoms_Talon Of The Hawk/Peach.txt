Peach Lyrics
You are my peach, you are my plum
You are my Earth, you are my Sun
All of your fingers, all of your toes
The back of your head, the tip of your nose

And you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about
Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about

One day, you will find someone who will love you like you deserve
But tonight, I'm the only one left, and I'm betting it's a fact that you will never learn
Once I sink my teeth, your skin's not so tough
I'll leave a tiny cut
There'll be a lot of blood
But once you wipe it up
You will feel better about our entire situation

You are my light, no need to hide
You are my clock, keep me on time
You are my angel, you are my crime
I'll serve this sentence the rest of my life
And you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about
Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling
When there is nothing to smile about

I do things wrong
You thought I might
You say I'm gonna miss you when you leave
And you are probably right
But I'm just as stoned
I don't wanna fight
You say I should think before I talk
You say I shouldn't think about my life
'Cause once I finally hit the ground
Who's gonna drag me into the light?
It's just so hard to see tomorrow past tonight, whoa
It's just so hard to see tomorrow past tonight, whoa
Whoa-ho-ho-ho8Embed
