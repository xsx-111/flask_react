Swear to God the Devil Made Me Do It Lyrics
Space-Age Crystals
I've been growing 'em since I was a kid
Like my mother plays the lottery
'Til I get rich some other way, or she wins it

And there is someone out there just like me
Probably keeping to themselves

I know CPR, I know mouth-to-mouth
When your legs give in and your lungs give out
I will blow air into your open mouth
Baby, I can spit this game all day

I swear to God, the Devil made me do it
It's a shame the bad habits are the hardest ones to break
Our love's a dangerous, dangerous game
One that I am definitely losing, cannot walk away

And there is someone out there just like me
Probably keeping to themselves
I know CPR, I know mouth-to-mouth
When your legs give in and your lungs give out
I will blow air into your open mouth
Baby, I can spit this game all day

I wanna make tear-jerking, shower-curtain, cameras-running genius
I wanna make them think they're seeing something they ain't ever seen before
But I am full of shit, I'm a plagiarist; as a liar, I'm a ten
I just want this to mean something to anyone, even if they don't know who I am
I am, I am, I am

But I know CPR
I know mouth-to-mouth
When your legs give in and your lungs give out
I will blow air into your open mouth
I know CPR
