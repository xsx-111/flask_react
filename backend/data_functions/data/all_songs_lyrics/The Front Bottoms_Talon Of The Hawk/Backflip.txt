Backflip Lyrics
I don't see me mad at situations
I see me turn and walk away
I see a tattoo on my right thigh
That I will probably regret one day
Yeah, I will probably regret one day
But now, I am happy to be bonding
In a kitchen with my friends
A spool of thread, a few more good vibes
A safety pin and a ballpoint pen
A safety pin and a ballpoint pen
A safety pin and a ballpoint pen
And a ballpoint pen

But there are answers here
They're just harder to figure out
Since all your questions got harder
To dodge and dip around
And there is nothing wrong with my lifestyle
No matter how many times I tell myself
To breathe in—hold it; hold it—now, let it out
Now, let it out

One day, I will realize I don't need this
Because it is just not who I am
Until that day comes, I'll keep my eyes closed
And I will try to feel all of the effects
Yeah, I will try to feel all of the effects
And now, I am talking way too fast
And a little bit louder than I should
Trying to say, "Thank you for understanding my side of the story the best that you could"
My side of the story the best that you could
My side of the story the best that you could
The best that you could
But there are answers here
They're just harder to figure out
Since all your questions got harder
To dodge and dip around
And there is nothing wrong with your lifestyle
No matter how many times they tell themselves
Just breathe in—hold it; hold it—now, let it out
Now, let it out

And this is how the cool boyfriend sits
In the passenger seat of his girlfriend's car
He's lookin' at me, I wish the light would turn green
Set me free, oh set me free, oh set me
Teach my rolling veins
Where there's a will, there is a way
Just cut me open, let me drain, oh let me drain
Oh, let me drain, oh, let me

I'll move to Florida, and I'll buy a brand new pickup truck
And I'll tint all the windows, including the driver's side
Now, you can't see me, so you can't touch me
When I sit at the red light and watch your boyfriend
Wonder if I'm inside, if I am dead inside3Embed
