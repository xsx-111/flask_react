Sitting Round at Home Lyrics
Sitting 'round at home, sitting 'round at home
Sitting 'round at home, watching the pictures go
Sitting 'round at home, sitting 'round at home
Sitting 'round at home, watching the pictures go

I watch the news at one, I do it every day
They always find someone to take my mind away

It's a family show, ten-part serial
Something for everyone, tea on end part one

Whatever turned you off, was it the turning on?
Ideal state of mind, increase your perception

Sitting 'round at home, sitting 'round at home
Sitting 'round at home, watching the pictures go
Sitting 'round at home, sitting 'round at home
Sitting 'round at home, watching the pictures go

And sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and sitting
And sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and sitting
And sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and sitting
And sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and sitting
And sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and sitting
And sitting, and sitting, and sittingEmbed
