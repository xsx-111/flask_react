Money Lyrics
What is inside me is caged here beside me
Life is a zoo
I'm labelled him, and it's labelled you
Life is a zoo

Life's a zoo

You are a stranger, but I'm even stranger
What can I do?
Life's getting stranger, and strangers are stranger
What can we do?

Life's a zoo

I am a stranger, and you're even stranger
What can you do?
Life's getting stranger, and strangers are stranger
What can we do?

Life's a zooEmbed
