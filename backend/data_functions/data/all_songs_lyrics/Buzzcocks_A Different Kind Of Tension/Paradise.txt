Paradise Lyrics
Where in the world are we?
Everything's fake, nothing's real
I guess it just depends on how you feel
Why are you wasting my time?
With questions when everything's fine?
Why are things so nice?
Is this the place that they call paradise?
Oh, it's paradise

Loaf around day by day
See the people on their way
On Friday nights, collecting their pay
So don't tell me what's wrong and what's right
'cause a knife fight on Saturday night
Is the only kind of justice, not nice
But it's the only kind that's given here in paradise
Oh, it's paradise, oh

Oh, where in the world are we?
Everything's fake, nothing's real
I guess it just depends on how you feel
Why are you wasting my time?
With questions when everything's fine?
Oh, why are things so nice?
Is this the place that they call paradise?
Oh, it's paradise, ohEmbed
