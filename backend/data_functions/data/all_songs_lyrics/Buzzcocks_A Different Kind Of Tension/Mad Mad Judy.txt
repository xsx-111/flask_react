Mad Mad Judy Lyrics
Mad, mad Judy, mad, mad girl
Mad, mad Judy, mad at all the world
She told her friend she cried a lot and ended up in tears
Mad, mad Judy, mad for years

Well does she, does she know?
Ain't nothing left in all the world, except insanity

Mad, mad Judy, mad, mad girl
Mad, mad Judy, mad at all the world
She told her friend she was paranoid and ended up in fear
Mad, mad Judy, mad for years

Well does she, does she know?
Ain't nothing left in all the world, except obscurity

She wanted something she never got, but don't know what it is
Mad, mad Judy, mad for years

Well does she, does she know?
Ain't nothing left in all the world, except diversity
Y'know what I mean? Eh?
Y'know what I mean?
Hmm, yeah, I know what you mean
'cause if three fellas, one said to the other
So I said to them, I said
I told 'em straight, 
You understand now? I understand
I've got all the answers!Embed
