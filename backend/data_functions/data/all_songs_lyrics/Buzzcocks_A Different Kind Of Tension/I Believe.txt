I Believe Lyrics
In these times of contention, it's not my intention to make things plain
I'm looking through mirrors to cast a reflection that can't be mine
I'm losing control now, I'll just have to slow down a thought or two
I can't feel the future, and I'm not even certain that there is a past

I believe in the worker's revolution
And I believe in the final solution
I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the shape of things to come
And I believe I'm not the only one
Yes, I believe in, I believe in

When I poison my system, I take thoughts and twist them into shapes
I'm reaching my nadir, and I haven't an idea of what to do
I'm painting by numbers, but can't find the colours that fill you in
I'm not even knowing if I'm coming or going, if to end or begin

I believe in the immaculate conception
And I believe in the resurrection
And I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the elixir of youth
And I believe in the absolute truth
Yes, I believe in, I believe in
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore

I've fallen from favour while trying to savour experience
I'm seeing things clearly, but it has quite nearly blown my mind
It's the aim of existence to offer resistance to the flow of time
Everything is, and that is why it is, will be the line

I believe in perpetual motion
And I believe in perfect devotion
I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the things I've never had
I believe in my mum and my dad
And I believe in, I believe in

There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore

I'm skipping the pages of a book that takes ages for the foreword to end
Triangular cover concealing another aspect from view
My relative motion is just an illusion from stopping too fast
The essence of being, these feelings I'm feeling, I just want them to last
I believe in original sin
And I believe what I believe in
Yes, I believe in, I believe in
I believe in the web of fate
And I believe I'm going to be late
So I'll be leavin' what I believe in

There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is a-no a-love a-in a-this a-world a-an a-ny a-more
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is a-no a-love a-in a-this a-world a-an a-ny a-more
There is a-no a-love a-in this world anymore
There is a-no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore
There is no love in this world anymore1Embed
