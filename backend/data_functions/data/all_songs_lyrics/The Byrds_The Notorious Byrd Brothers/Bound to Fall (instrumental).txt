Bound to Fall (instrumental) LyricsJust as everything's going fine
Lose my grip and slide
Bounce the rock and and catch the ball bound to fall
Fall stumble or toe the line
See my face and hide
Catch the tears I've cried
From reality it seems I've strayed
Tired of all the silly games I play
Da da da da
From reality it seems I've strayed
Tired of all the silly games I play
Just as everything's going fine
See my life in rhyme
Hear my hand slip from the wall bound to fall
Fall, stumble and reaching blind
Oh, how hard I've tried
Possibly I've diedEmbed
