Artificial Energy LyricsSitting all alone now
I took my ticket to ride
Just a matter of time now
'Til I'll be up in the sky
Coming up on me now
I'm king for a night
What's it gonna be now?
Powerful things are brewing inside
Do you think it's really the truth that you see?
I've got my doubts it's happened to me
Artificial energy
Is wrestling my mind
I've got a strange feeling
I'm going to die before my time
I'm coming down off amphetamine
And I'm in jail 'cause I killed the queenEmbed
