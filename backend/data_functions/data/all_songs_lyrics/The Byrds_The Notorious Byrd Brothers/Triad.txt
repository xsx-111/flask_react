Triad LyricsYou want to know how it will be
Me and her, or you and me
You both stand there, your long hair flowing
Your eyes alive, your mind still growing
Saying to me what can we do now that we both love you
I love you too
And I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three
You are afraid, embarrassed too
No one has ever said such a thing to you
Your mother's ghost stands at your shoulders
A face like ice, a little bit colder
Saying to you, you cannot do that
It breaks all the rules, you learned in school
But I don't really see
Why can't we go on as three
We love each other, it's plain to see
There's just one answer that comes to be
Sister lovers, water brothers, and in time maybe others
So you see what we can do is to try something new
If you're crazy too
And I don't really see
Why can't we go on as threeEmbed
