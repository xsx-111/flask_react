Get to You LyricsStanding in the airport I am waiting for a plane
Goin' east to London, want to be back there again
It's the right time of year, all the trees are autumn brown
But I really only want to get to you
Sitting by the window, watching ocean going by
Seems I should be with you but how fast can this thing fly
Hey how it seemed like an eternity
All the time it took me trying to get to you
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Standing in the airport I am getting off the plane
Glad to be in London even though it's pouring rain
It's a bright sunny day when I see you run my way
But it took me twenty years to get to you
It's a bright sunny day when I see you run my way
But it took me twenty years to get to you
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little better
Oh, that's a little betterEmbed
