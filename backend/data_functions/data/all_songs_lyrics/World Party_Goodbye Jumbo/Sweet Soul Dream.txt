Sweet Soul Dream LyricsI'd give you all my money
Abandon that beatiful girl
Take my books
My choicest looks
And burn them all today
I've got rare '61 Beatles
I got a feilm of my dreams
But I'd lose them all
Burn em all
Go along without all of it
Give up the chances I see
If you'd take me up
Raise me up
Let me know the heart of it
Give me your sweet soul dream
Give me your sweet soul dream
I don't need a body
A body's nobody to me
It's just a cell
And I'm leaving well
When I get you to give me the key
You can take all my postcards and letters
My loves and my good memories
Well I'd lose them all
Burn them all
Go without all of it
Give up the chances I see
If you'd raise me up
Take me up
Let me know the heart of it
Give me your sweet soul dream
Give me your sweet soul dream
I'm trying to learn understanding
Against the hell I can win
If you'd hold me up
Grow me up
Let me be a part of it
Give me the chance that I see
I could take me up
Raise me up
Get to know the heart of it
Give me your sweet soul dream
Give me your sweet soul dream
Give me your sweet soul dream
