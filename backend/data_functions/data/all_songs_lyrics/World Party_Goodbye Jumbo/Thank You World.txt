Thank You World LyricsColours scenst and symphonies
Fall on me like tears
And time around me stretches back
And forth across the years
Was I sent to see your beauty
Just to please my aching heart
Well I want to say good morning
But I don't know where to start
Thank you world
Ah thank you world
Ah thank you world
Ah thank you world
Ah thank you world
Well I'm lying in the dw
And I'm staring at the stars
Yeah He laid me down this blanket
Now I call this blanket grass
And the sun is my alarm
And the moon she makes me dream
And my food is wild honey pie
And water from the stream, thank you world
Ah thank you world
Thank you world
Ah thank you world
For giving me my children
Ah thank you world
For keeping me alive
Ah thank you world
Yeah yeah yeah
Are you getting the vibe?
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Are you really alive?
Yeah yeah yeah
Are you getting the vibe?
Yeah yeah yeah
Are you really alive?
Chorus
She is everything I need
She is living guaranteed
She's what I mean when I say
Everything's alright
She got diamonds she got pearls
She got wisdom
And this girl is all you need
To know that everything's alright
And I need to know that everything's alright
