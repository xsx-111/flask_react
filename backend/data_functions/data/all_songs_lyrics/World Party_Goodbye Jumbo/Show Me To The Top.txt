Show Me To The Top LyricsBaby you're cute in you little black hat
You had a dream but it won't come back
It's waving to you from the top of your hill
For twenty years man it's living there still
But you been a liar
You been a flop
And now you just want to get to the top
Where is this top baby, where's this top you mean
I've got the feeling that it's something obscene
Show me to the top
Somewhere I can look around
Why don't you show me to the top
C'mon c'mon and show me your top
Will you be ready for the new sensation?
A suit of clothes never thought that you'd wear
What's in your mind for the whole duration
Depends on just what they put in your head
Even if you're lying
Or you been a flop
Well pretty soon you're going up to the top
Where is this top baby where's this top I mean
Well it's a city of a thousand dreams
Show me to the top
Somewhere I can look around
Why don't you show me to the top yeh
See the heaven in your mind
Why don't you show me to the top
I'd give you 100 dollars
If you show me show me your top yeah
But you're not fighting
You're not fighting
You're not fighthing
You're not fighting
Fighting the right war
L.O.V.E
L.O.V.E
L.O.V.E
Love is a fruit baby that's no lie
Love is a fruit so c'mon and be a fly
Sing it
Show me to the top
Never let it drop
You know this ain't no time to stop
Won't you show me
C'mon and show me to the top
'Bout time we made it to the top yeh
