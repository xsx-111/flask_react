Mia Lyrics
Isn't it strange
The way it's just over?
No late night calls
You're not here to walk me to my door
Now I just love you more

Mia, don't cry
I love you forever
But I've gotta grow up now
No, I can't keep holding on to you anymore
Mia, I'm still yours

Lost love, so strange
And heaven's not real, babe
But I wish that I
Could lay down next to you

You're fixin' your hair on the way to his place off of Broadway and 9th
If you're wakin' up slow together
And talking through the night
I bet he feels so fuckin' light
Lost love, so strange
And heaven's not real, babe
Well I wish that I
Could lay down next to you
I wish that I could lay down next to you, you1Embed
