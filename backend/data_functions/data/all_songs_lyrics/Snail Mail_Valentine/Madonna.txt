Madonna Lyrics
You've got a way to you, original Madonna
Won't make the rest just go away
You spent the money, throwing 1's at supermodels
Everybody wants to taste the wine
Line around the block at judgment time
And how could you deny them that?

Body and blood, lover's curse
Divine intervention was too much work
I don't need absolution, it just hurts
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking now

I consecrate my life to kneeling at your altar
My second sin of seven being wanting more
Could that have been the smell of roses, backseat lover?
Praying you'd fill my empty cup
Or cursing myself for even getting dressed up

Body and blood, lover's curse
Divine intervention was too much work
I don't need absolution, no, it just hurts
We're not really talking now
Body and blood, I'll atone
Get to it now, or we can fight on the phone
I used to wanna get even, I'll just get stoned
Bow to your divinity
Gonna wipe the dirt off me
Our love's a sickness, baby
I'm holding on tight, I don't know why
I've come to hate my body
'Cause now it's not yours, now it's not mine
I don't know why, oh I don't know why but
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking nowEmbed
