Forever (Sailing) Lyrics
I might have made a stranger out of you
And I'm stranger too
I know that's not my perfume on you, Tiger
And we don't have long
Doesn't obsession just become me?
Don't let 'em see
We don't owe it to nobody
No matter where we are
I love you from the city to the stars
But nothin' stays as good as how it starts

You and I
Like a ship, forever sailing
You and I
Everything we try is failing
Everything we do
Everything we try

Time tends to pass and make a joke of things, but
Eleven months and still
Some nights I rеach for you
Like you're besidе me
You're takin' her home
Does an obsession just become you?
You're takin' that tone
Icy cold, come on
I loved you
Whatever you decide
I'll chase you from the city to the sky
And lose myself for you a thousand times

You and I
Like a ship forever sailing
You and I
Everything we try is failing
Everything we do
Everything we try

You and I
(Like a ship, forever sailing)
You and I
(Everything we try is failing)
Everything we do
Everything we try

So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
And you don't just forget
So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
And you don't just forget (No more)
So much destruction (Everything is her)
Look at what we did (No more)
That was so real (Everything is her)
And you don't just forget (No more)
So much destruction (Everything is her)
Look at what we did (No more)
That was so real (Everything is her)
You don't just forget (No more)
(Everything is her)
You don't just forget (No more)
(Everything is her)
You don't just forget (No more)
(Everything is her)
You don't just forget (No more)
(Everything is her)1Embed
