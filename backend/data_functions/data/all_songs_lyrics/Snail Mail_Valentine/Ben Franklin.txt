Ben Franklin Lyrics
On two, feels like spring
All on my own, guess the shit just makes you boring
Got money, I don't care about sex
You knew how I'd take it, you brought her to flex

Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain
Like a relapse does when you really tried
And damn, this time, I really tried

Moved on, but nothing feels true
Sometimes I hate her just for not being you
Post-rehab, I've been feeling so small
I miss your attention, I wish I could call

Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leavе a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would'vе died for me
Raised your voice to me
The second time I had to make myself believe
I deserve it, I'm crazy
But don't act like you've never met me

I never should've hurt you
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me

Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would've died for me1Embed
