Glory Lyrics
You want it all
Superstar
Jesus died just to save you
Walk me down
Hollywood Boulevard
Get me high in the hotel room

You owe me
You own me
I could never hurt you, my love
You know me

When it gets cold
We'll move to Malibu
Where the drinks are hard
You make them go down smooth
You wanna make it hurt
Superstar
When you took too much in your bedroom

You owe me
You own me
I could never hurt you, my love
You know me
You owe me
You own me
Couldn't evеn look at you straight on
Shining in your gloryEmbed
