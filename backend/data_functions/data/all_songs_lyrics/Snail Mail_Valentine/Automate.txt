Automate Lyrics
One more drink 'til I can feel you
And when the party's empty
We can slow dance in my room
Tried life without you
But you in that green sweater
I could die if I had the guts
Puked it up, drank too much
Feed the flame forever

Automate me
And I'll never find a love like this
I'm free
But who was I to ever want like this?
You got so mean
Pouring out the Jack and consequence
When you're with me
And who was I to ever want like this?

Blank lips, dark room
I pretend it's you
But she kissed like she meant it
It's like I'm livin', an' I'm past her
And it's thirteen days after
But it still feels like I'm cheating
One more drink 'til
I can lay beside you
Though all at once is better
Automate me
And I'll never find a love like this
I'm free
But who was I to ever want like this?
You got so mean
Pouring out the Jack and consequence
When you're with me
And who was I to ever want like this?

I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
And I'm like your dog
I'm like your dog
Only I know you'll be sweet if I stay
And it's not enough
Conditional love
When I'm old and rotten, you'll be on your way
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
And childishly I'm lonely when it's time to clear out the party
