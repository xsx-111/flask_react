Valentine Lyrics
Let's go be alone
Where no one can see us, honey
Careful in that room
Those parasitic cameras, don't they stop to stare at you?

Can't love for us both
You've gotta live and I gotta go
As long as it's us two
Fuck being remembered, I think I was made for you

So why'd you wanna erase me, darling valentine?
You'll always know where to find me when you change your mind

I'd hate to picture someone with you
I lay down and start to cry
You won't believe what just two months do
I'm older now, believe mе, I adore you

So why'd you wanna erase mе, darling valentine?
You'll always know where to find me when you change your mind
So why'd you wanna erase me, darling valentine?
Now I can't hate you
I ruined me for you
Blame me if you need to
But I adore you
I adore you
I adore you
I adore you5Embed
