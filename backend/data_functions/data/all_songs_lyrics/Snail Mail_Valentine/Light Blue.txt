Light Blue Lyrics
First time I met you, I knew then
Afterwards there'd be
No in-between
We can sail the ocean blue
Or just lie down, you know
How I love you

Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now

I wanna wake up early every day
Just to be awake
In the same world as you
I won't ever hurt you
No more endless nights
Only the lightest blues

If anyone should stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now, now, now, now
I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going backEmbed
