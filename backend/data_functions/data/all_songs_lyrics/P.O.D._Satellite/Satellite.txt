Satellite Lyrics
Satellite
Satellite

I wonder how clear it must look from there to here
No obstruction, this selfish corruption, all in this atmosphere
No fear, less tears, only time to catch my breath
I fail to inhale, your love constricts my chest
Confusion blinded me, mental and physically
And it's because of you that now I can see
So now I can run, I follow the son and ride on to Zion
And dance this last song of freedom
But only time will tell, if it's truly for real
Can't change your mind, all I know this is what I feel
Whether I'm wrong or right, please keep my life in sight
And never take you eyes off me

As I look up to the sky today
Well I can see you looking down on me
It brings a smile to my face again
Satellite

Satellite
Satellite
It's truly one of a kind, like star shine
Beyond night time, are you there?
My eyes stare to find, just what's behind
This blind notion of mine, is it genuine, cause sometimes
It plays tricks with my mind, some call it asinine
But it's like love or hate, now is that real or fake?
Cause it's a real thin line, but that's your choice to make
The question at hand, help me understand, is this your plan?
I think I can, can I think, then I think I can
Because I won't break and I won't shake
With lifted hands to this man, I'll stand in faith
I'll make it through, my trust in you
Close my eyes, make a wish, kiss the sky
Hey there, I see you

Shining light, shining light
Blinding light, blinding light
Shining light, shining light
Blinding light

(Satellite) When I look up to the sky today
I can feel you looking down on me
(Satellites) It brings a smile to my face again
Satellite

(Satellite, satellite
Guiding light, guiding light
Shining bright, shining bright
Guiding light, guiding light
Satellite) As I look into the sky today
Satellite, blinding light
(Satellite)
(Blinding light, shining light)
It brings a smile to my face again
(Shining light, guiding light
Guiding light)

It's truly one of a kind
Like star shine
Beyond night time
Are you there?
Are you there?
Are you there?2Embed
