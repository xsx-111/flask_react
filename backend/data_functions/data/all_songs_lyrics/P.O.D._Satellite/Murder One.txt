Murder One Lyrics
Murder One, Murder One
Murder One in the first degree

I've been re-birthed by the fire, live in stereo roots
And we the street prophesiers, screaming truth to the youth
So bring it on Babylon, you wanna come test me?
Cause I'm gonna break you off proper, most definitely
With this raised power fist, my freedom for a death wish
I sign my life on the line, then seal it with a kiss
See I know this, ready to die for my belief
Cause this is Murder One coming in the first degree

Murder One, Murder One
Murder One in the first degree

What does it mean, if you don't really want it?
With all these things in my mind that are going on
Don't bother wasting my time, your falling down by the waste side
Falling down by the waste side
This is the last time I feel I can run it
Don't wanna try cause you know I'm gonna blow it all
If it's alright with you, I think i'd rather just stay blind
I'd rather die than to let it go
This is for the soul rebels and the sole survivors
Still waving on their flags after these fakes retire
One love magnifier, pass the real, light the wire
So all you naturalistics can get a little bit higher
This is the revolution, the sounds of execution
And I'm known to keep it moving, so don't ask me how I'm doing it
Guilty as charged and even if they sentence me
I'm gonna plead the fifth, face the judge and take the penalty

Murder One in the first degree

What does it mean, if you don't really want it?
With all these things in my mind that are going on
Don't bother wasting my time, your falling down by the waste side
Falling down by the waste side
This is the last time I feel I can run it
Don't wanna try cause you know I'm gonna blow it all
If it's alright with you, I think i'd rather just stay blind
I'd rather die than to let it go

I don't care what they say, this is real
That's the thing that's keeping me alive, that's the truth
That's the stuff that I believe in, ain't no turning back from this point
I've been through the fire, I don't wanna go back
I know in what I believe, and I'm willing to lay my life down for the things that I believe
And you can never take that away
I'll never let it go
What does it mean, if you don't really want it?
With all these things in my mind that are going on
Don't bother wasting my time, your falling down by the waste side
Falling down by the waste side
This is the last time I feel I can run it
Don't wanna try cause you know I'm gonna blow it all
If it's alright with you, I think i'd rather just stay blind
I'll never let it go
I'll never let it go (Let it go)Embed
