Alive Lyrics
Every day is a new day
I'm thankful for every breath I take
I won't take it for granted (I won't take it for granted)
So I learn from my mistakes
It's beyond my control sometimes it's best to let go
Whatever happens in this lifetime
So I trust in love (So I trust in love)
You have given me peace of mind

I, I feel so alive
For the very first time
And I can't deny you
I feel so alive
And I, I feel so alive (so alive)
For the very first time
And I think I can fly

Sunshine upon my face (Sunshine upon my face)
A new song for me to sing
I tell this world how I feel inside (Tell the world how I feel inside)
Even though it might cost me everything
Now that I know this all beyond my control
Cause I could never turn my back away
Now that I see you (Now that I see you)
I can never look away
I, I feel so alive
For the very first time
I can't deny you
I feel so alive
I, I feel so alive (I feel so alive)
For the very first time (For the very first time)
And I think I can fly

And now that I know you
I could never turn my back away
And now that I see you
I could never look away
And now that I know you
I could never turn my back away
And now that I see you
I believe no matter what they say

I, I feel so alive
For the very first time
I can't deny you
I feel so alive
I, I feel so alive (I feel so alive)
For the very first time (For the very first time)
And I think I can fly
I, I feel so alive (I feel so alive)
For the very first time (For the very first time)
For the very first time
And I think I can fly
I, I feel so alive (I feel so alive)
For the very first time (For the very first time)
And I think I can fly
And I think I can fly
And I think I can fly
And I think I can fly2Embed
