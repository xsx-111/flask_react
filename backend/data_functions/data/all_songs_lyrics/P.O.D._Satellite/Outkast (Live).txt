Outkast (Live) Lyrics
I'm an outcast
But don't count me out
I'm an outcast
But don't count me out
I'm an outcast
But don't count me out
I'm an outcast
But don't count me out
I'm an outcast
But don't count me out
I'm an outcast
But don't count me out

I'm an outkast
But don't count me out
I'm an outkast
But don't count me out

Underground dwellers, roaming beneath the cellars
Failed us with this system, ain't living how they tell us
Hideaway place, it's safe, they raise a nation of hate
Erase a man for his faith
They feed us lies, dress up my King in false disguise
Behind those eyes, soul of a savior I recognize
No compromise, while the whole world becomes corrupt
Tonight we break the surface for lives, We coming up
Brother take my hand
Let's separate ourselves
Leave behind this place
Don't ever look back
Brother take my hand
Let's separate ourselves
Leave behind this place
Don't ever look back

Disgraced man, survivors of the wasteland
Looking for a home of his own
No place to run, no place to hide
It's time for you to stand on your own
Militia, coalition, not of this world
Resistance, we the alliance
We freedom fighters, its honor we defend
We follow truth and never your trends

Brother take my hand
Let's separate ourselves
Leave behind this place
Don't ever look back
Brother take my hand
Let's separate ourselves
Leave behind this place
Don't ever look back
Outcast
Don't ever count me out
I'm an outcast
Never count me out
I'm an outcast
Don't ever count me out
I'm an outcast
Never count me out
I'm an outcast
So don't count me out!!!

Outcast, I'm an outcast
So don't count me out
Outcast, I'm an outcast
So don't count me out

Brace yourself like a man
Brace yourself like a man
Brace yourself like a man
Outcast!
Brace yourself like a man
Brace yourself like a man
Brace yourself like a man
So don't count me out
Brace yourself like a man
Brace yourself like a man
Brace yourself like a man
Outcast!
Brace yourself like a man
Brace yourself like a man
Brace yourself like a man
So don't count me outEmbed
