Portrait Lyrics
You're not who they say You are
They made You the enemy, enemy, enemy!
Christ! In Jah flesh
Christ! The light within
Christ! Beginning and the end (Christ!)
They have taken something so beautiful
Painted a new picture that makes me sick, sick sick
Christ! Witness
Christ! Living one
Christ! First and last
Feed our minds confusion
Sweeten the taste of pollution
Christ! Word life
Christ! Resurrect
Christ! Everlasting Jah

Some people call You Father
Maybe You could set me free
These people hate each other
But You've always been there for me

I refuse to be like you
Without my life, caving in, caving in, caving in
Christ! In Jah flesh
Christ! The light within
Christ! Beginning and the end (Christ!)
I surrender, giving up all that is me
Yielding to you
Christ! Witness
Christ! Living one
Christ! First and last
Shape me in my brokenness
Empower me forever
Christ! Word life
Christ! Resurrect
Christ! Everlasting Jah
Some people call You Father
Maybe You could set me free
These people hate each other
But You've always been there for me
Some people call You Father
Maybe You could set me free
These people hate each other
But You've always been there for me
Some people call You Father
Maybe You could set me free
These people hate each other
But You've always been there for me

I know You will complete this work started in me
I need You more than ever now that I know who You are
I know You will complete this work started in me
I need You more than ever now that I've come so far
I know You will complete this work started in me
I need You more than ever now that I know who You are1Embed
