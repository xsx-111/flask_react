Thinking About Forever Lyrics
Time goes by and God knows I try to carry on with life
Decide not to hide feelings inside, even though they hurt
Sometimes, I forget to remember you
It's easy to lock away these pains, don't want to relive it through
But I stay strong, you taught me how to move on in this world
I married my sweetheart, even got a little baby girl
I wish you could see her, I swear she looks just like you
If you can hear me, show me a sign, please send her a butterfly or two

I'm thinking about forever, missing you
I know you're so much better, we made it through

Now I know what it means to live for someone else
To give up yourself
Things have changed, at times it gets kind of strange
Your love remains the same
Do I make you proud? Mama, can you see me now?
Whatever's good in me is because you showed me how to take love by the hand
And so now I can share you with my baby
So that she can understand

I'm thinking about forever, missing you
I know you're so much better, we made it through

I'm thinking about forever, missing you
I know you're so much better, we made it through
I'm thinking about forever, missing you
I know you're so much better, we made it through
I'm tripping on whatever, hearing you1Embed
