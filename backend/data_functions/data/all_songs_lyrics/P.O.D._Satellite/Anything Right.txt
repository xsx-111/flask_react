Anything Right Lyrics
So much to say so little time for me
To explain the way I feel. You only see
Things the way you want to see them (Want to see them)
It makes sense to you
All these things you do
You got it all figured out
While everyone is confused
How do you do it? (How do you do it?)

In your mind I'm just blind
You're right all of the time
If I think for myself
I guess I'm way out of line
I'm not who you are
I'm so sorry (I'm so sorry)

I can't do anything right
You don't know me, stay out of my life
Kick me while I'm down, I want you to
I can't be like you
Don't wanna' be like you
I can't do anything right
You don't know me, stay out of my life
Kick me while I'm down, I want you to
I can't be like you
Be like you
No matter what I do it's never good enough
I give all that is me, still it's never enough
So, why try? I give up
What does it feel like to be in your shoes?
And walk over everyone like you do?
Tear me down again, I want you to (Want you to)

You're lovely, so beautiful
And you're perfect, in every way
Your interior rusted and I'm so disgusted
Can't trust it
You're busted

I can't do anything right
You don't know me, stay out of my life
Kick me while I'm down, I want you to
I can't be like you
Don't wanna' be like you
I can't do anything right
You don't know me, stay out of my life
Kick me while I'm down, I want you to
I can't be like you
Be like you
I can't do anything right
I can't do anything, anything right
I can't do anything, anything right
I can't do anything, anything right
I do anything right
Do anything rightEmbed
