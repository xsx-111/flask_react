Critic Lyrics
I can see you looking at me
Even though you're high on your perch
You say that you are my friend
Let's not pretend, let's not pretend

That you are, fake (Critic)
That you are, fake

You don't seem to care about us
Only care about yourself
You think you love, you say
Let's not pretend, let's not pretend

That you are, fake (Critic)
That you are, fake

You're so fake
You're so fake
You're so fake
You're so fake
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
You think you can criticize us
Even though you've never seen us
Your opinions disgrace us
You think you can criticize us
Even though you've never seen us
You are the enemy
You are the enemy
You are the enemy
You are the enemy

That you are, fake (Critic)
That you are, fake
(laughter)
Critics, ha!
