Ridiculous Lyrics
Many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many more
He come outside, P.O.D. many, many more
Many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many more

Skillfully tested, rhythmically possessed with rhymes
And when it was time, Jah gave me the mic after He blessed it
He said share the loving, prepare them for the second coming
Beware of false prophets cause they got my people buggin'
Put on the full armor
You know these fools are gonna wanna talk behind your back
But stay away from the drama
You know that I'ma keep you safe inside the palm of my hand
Cause you the man and that's word to your mama
So give it to 'em, it's themselves that they foolin'
Got ahead of the game too quick, what they lack is ol' skoolin'
You know who's who, whether or not I'm talkin' to your crew
It's up to you to keep it true, 'nough respect due

Them test me crew but they can't get with this
Them all the same talkin' wickedness
Your style's been played and I'm already sick of it
Them so ridiculous, them so ridiculous
Them test me crew but they can't get with this
Them all the same talkin' the nonsense
Your style's been played and I'm already sick of it
Them so ridiculous, so ridiculous
Original rude boy, we bring the styles
Ain't heard this in a while, check the stats review my profile
They dime a dozen can't understand why they all fussin'
Known for talkin' loud, but they really sayin' nothin'
With every word you poison my mental concept
Negative be the topic, somebody's gotta stop it
And clear your mind and continue to come alive
Cause he love, we love, bring it back, come rewind

Them test me crew but they can't get with this
Them all the same talkin' wickedness
Your style's been played and I'm already sick of it
Them so ridiculous, them so ridiculous
Them test me crew but they can't get with this
Them all the same talkin' the nonsense
Your style's been played and I'm already sick of it
Them so ridiculous, so ridiculous


Them test me crew but they can't get with this
Them all the same talkin' wickedness
Your style's been played and I'm already sick of it
Them so ridiculous, them so ridiculous
Them test me crew but they can't get with this
Them all the same talkin' the nonsense
Your style's been played and I'm already sick of it
Them so ridiculous, so ridiculous
Them test me crew but they can't get with this
Them all the same talkin' wickedness
Your style's been played and I'm already sick of it
Them so ridiculous, them so ridiculous
Them test me crew but they can't get with this
Them all the same talkin' the nonsense
Your style's been played and I'm already sick of it
Them so ridiculous, so ridiculous

Ridiculous, P.O.D says them ridiculousEmbed
