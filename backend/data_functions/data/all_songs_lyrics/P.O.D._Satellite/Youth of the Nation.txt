Youth of the Nation Lyrics
Last day of the rest of my life
I wish I would've known 'cause I didn't kiss my mama goodbye
I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I cared
Or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
Unaware, I just did what I always do
Every day, the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest?
Instead of takin' a test, I took two to the chest
Call me blind, but I didn't see it comin'
Everybody was runnin', but I couldn't hear nothin' except
Gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid, though I sit by him in class
Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love
Or maybe for a moment, he forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was, I know it's because

We are, we are (We are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) youth of the nation

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself
She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations, just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her she deserved much better
Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules so you would think he was cool
He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried, often thought of suicide
It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end, they might remember him then
You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat
We are, we are (We are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are) youth of the nation

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim?
No matter what you say, it don't take away the pain
That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why, it's the blind leadin' the blind
Guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense? Somebody's gotta know
There's gotta be more to life than this
There's gotta be more to everything I thought exists

We are, we are, the youth of the nation
We are, we are, youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are, we are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are, we are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (We are, we are) the youth of the nation (The youth of the nation)
We are, we are (We are, we are) youth of the nation (The youth of the nation)
We are, we are (We are, we are) the youth of the nation (The youth of the nation)
We are, we are (We are, we are) youth of the nation (The youth of the nation)
(We are) Youth of the nation
(We are) Youth of the nation
(We are) Youth of the nation
(We are)10Embed
