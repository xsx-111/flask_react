Masterpiece Conspiracy Lyrics
Evil eyes behind their smiles
You swallow it up when sincerity lies
And lock me up, label dangerous files
For the unknown, so you're scared of my style
Alert the press and address the states
Of emergency with a crew you love to hate
First mistake, you were never ready
Dance with the dead, better be ten times more deadly
This is me, I'm always the same
Virus in the system, crash the mainframe

Uprise, now fall in line
Roll with the pack or get left behind

It's a masterpiece conspiracy!
(Make way!)
It's a masterpiece conspiracy!
(Make way!)
It's a masterpiece conspiracy!
(Make way!)
It's a masterpiece!

I'd rather hear it from you than be lied to
Call it what it is, like the heathens do
With lives of betrayal, deceived again
Exposed by the light, two colors of sin
Take down the regimen, break the trend
Rushed by your peers and your so-called friends
Keep your peoples tight, watch your enemies close
Trust what you know, soon enough they'll choke
Where were you when we started this thing?
You wasn't around, this ain't yours to claim
You'll never take what's been given to us
Wipe that smile off your face and a look of disgust
Uprise, now fall in line
Roll with the pack or get left behind

It's a masterpiece conspiracy!
(Make way!)
It's a masterpiece conspiracy!
(Make way!)
It's a masterpiece conspiracy!
(Make way!)
It's a masterpiece!

Liar, backstabber, betrayer
