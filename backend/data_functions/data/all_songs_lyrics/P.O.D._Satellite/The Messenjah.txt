The Messenjah Lyrics
I message, written in rhyme, prophetic
Teachers amongst the skeptics and guiding the misdirected
Infected with their lies and their alibis
With their third eye blind, out of line, they try to prophesy
I and I unfold the mysteries told
The futuristic realms to the days of old
Make straight through the path of the one voice calling
Truth shines, back again two times in the Second Coming

I! I am the Messenjah
I am the Messenjah!
I am the Messenjah
I am the Messenjah!
I am the Messenjah
I am the Messenjah!
I am the Messenjah

This I pledge and I'm taking to my death
I'll lay my life down for you and die over again
I and I, I'm not ashamed of the Most High
Even if I die tonight, if I die tonight
This I pledge and I'm taking to my death
You can bet your life on my words and everything I said
You can't take away my love for this sacrifice
Even if I die tonight, if I die tonight
True king descendant, master to the apprentice
Pleased to release and reveal in me his presence
Forever blessed, I believe it if Jah said it
The word of life came alive in these scriptures, I read it
All hail, we prevail, the Tribes of Israel, flow through ya
We pursue the conquering lion of the Tribe of Judah
Don't let 'em fool ya, before this, the foolish get rushed
So don't stop, you never knew us

I! I am the Messenjah
I am the Messenjah!
I am the Messenjah
I am the Messenjah!
I am the Messenjah
I am the Messenjah!
I am the Messenjah

This I pledge and I'm taking to my death
I'll lay my life down for you and die over again
I and I, I'm not ashamed of the Most High
Even if I die tonight, if I die tonight
This I pledge and I'm taking to my death
You can bet your life on my words and everything I said
You can't take away my love for this sacrifice
Even if I die tonight, if I die tonight

Make way!
Make way!
Make way!
Make way!
Make way!

This I pledge and I'm taking to my death
I'll lay my life down for you and die over again
I and I, I'm not ashamed of the Most High
Even if I die tonight, if I die tonight
This I pledge and I'm taking to my death
You can bet your life on my words and everything I said
You can't take away my love for this sacrifice
Even if I die tonight, if I die tonight

This I pledge and I'm taking to my death
I'll lay my life down for you and die over again, die over again
Make way!
Make way!
Make way!
Make way!
I am the MessenjahEmbed
