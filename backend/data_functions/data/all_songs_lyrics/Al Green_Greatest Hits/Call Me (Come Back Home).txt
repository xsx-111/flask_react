Call Me (Come Back Home) LyricsCall me, call me, call me

What a beautiful time we had together
Now it's getting late and we must leave each other, yeah
Just remember the time we had
And how right I tried to be
It's all in a day's work
Call me

Losing your love, acting foolishly
Go on and take your time
'Cause you're only losing me
Love is a long ways from here
Tell you, it's all in the way you feel
If your love is real
Come to me

Call me, call me, call me
Come back home

The best thing I can do is give you your love
(is give you your love, baby)
Let you go on your way
Feeling as free as a dove
And if you find you're a long ways from home
And somebody's doing you wrong
Just call on me baby
Come back home
Call me, call me
Come back home
Call me, call me
Come back home

When you're worried
Things ain't going right, yeah
It's all in a day's work
Call me
When you're lonely
You can call me
When you're feeling sad, baby
Oh oh oh, yeah
It's all in a day's work
Come back home

Call me, call me
Come back home
Call meEmbed
