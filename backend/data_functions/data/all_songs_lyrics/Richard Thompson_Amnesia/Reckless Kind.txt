Reckless Kind LyricsHere we stand in sheets of rain
Parting ways, loved in vain
Never knew you'd be the reckless kind
I reached out to catch your fall
Said you needed a place to crawl
Never knew you'd be the reckless kind
The reckless kind
The reckless kind
You're his, not mine
Say you run with a breakneck crowd
Live your love scenes right out loud
Break hearts all around you're the reckless kind
Said you were well satisfied
Proud to see me by your side
Pride's a worthless thing to the reckless kind
The reckless kind
The reckless kind
Love lies shattered on the ground
Jagged pieces all around
Say you'll come back, but I know you're the restless kind
The reckless kind
The reckless kind
You're his, not mine
His, not mine
The reckless kind
The reckless kindEmbed
