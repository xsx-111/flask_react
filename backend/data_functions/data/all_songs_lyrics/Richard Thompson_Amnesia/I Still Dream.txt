I Still Dream Lyrics
It was cruel of you to stand
At my door and take my hand
Like a drowning man I clung to my defenses
And ten years is a time
But your looks, love, it's a crime
And I lost my tongue in the tangle of my senses

And I never was to know
That I'd come to miss you so
But time winds down
And I turned my back long ago

But I still dream
Oh darling I still dream
Oh I still dream
Oh Lord knows I still dream

On the killing floor I stand
With a stun gun in my hand
Like a cowboy shooting badmen on the range
And nothing satisfies
And the soul inside me dies
As I duck each punch and never risk the change
And now you look at me
With that same old used-to-be
Oh but time winds down
And I turned my back long ago

But I still dream
Oh darling I still dream

Ah but now you look at me
With that same old used-to-be
But time winds down
And I turned my back long ago

But I still dream
Oh darling, darling I still dream
I still dream
Oh Lord knows, Lord knows I still dream
Oh I still dream
Oh darling, darling, darling I still dreamEmbed
