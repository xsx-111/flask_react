Yankee, Go Home LyricsOh, G.I. Joe put your gun away
The sun is setting on another day
Why don't you leave us alone
Yankee, go home
They're burning effigies out in the street
Man the lifeboats, sound the retreat
Pentagon's on the phone
Yankee, go home
You can't just kiss and run away
There ain't enough money on a sergeant's pay
When the dance hall girl you banged's in the family way
Well, you turned my sister into a whore
With a pair of silk stockings from the P.X. store
Why don't you leave us alone
Yankee, go home
Yankee, go home
Just go home
My girlfriend still won't talk to me
Since she met with a sailor from the land of the free
I'm tired of being alone
Yankee, go home
I lost count of the chewing gum that I've had
And Coca-Cola made my teeth go bad
We'll handle this on our own
Yankee, go home
Dow Jones going into a stall
Spray paint saying it on every wall
The climb was fine, now it's time to decline and fall
Overpaid, oversexed and over here
Get smart, gringo, disappear
The Hun's at the gates of Rome
Yankee, go home
Yankee, go home
Go home
Go home
Go homeEmbed
