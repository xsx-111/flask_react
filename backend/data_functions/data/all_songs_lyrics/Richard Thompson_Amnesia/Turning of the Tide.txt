Turning of the Tide Lyrics
How many boys, one night stands
How many lips, how many hands have held you
Like I'm holding you tonight?

Too many nights, staying up late
Too much powder and too much paint
Oh you can't hide from the turning of the tide

Did they run their fingers up and down your shabby dress?
Did they find some tender moment there in your caress?

The boys all say you look so fine
They don't come back for a second time
Oh you can't hide from the turning of the tide

Poor little sailor boy, never set eyes on a woman before
Did he tell you that he'd love you, darling, for evermore?

Pretty little shoes, cheap perfume
Creaking bed in a hotel room
Oh you can't hide from the turning of the tide
Did they run their fingers up and down your shabby dress?
Did they find some tender moment there in your caress?

The boys all say you look so fine
They don't come back for a second time
Oh you can't hide from the turning of the tideEmbed
