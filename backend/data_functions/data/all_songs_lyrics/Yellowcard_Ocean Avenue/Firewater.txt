Firewater Lyrics
You sat me down beside myself
To show me all the reasons I was wrong for you
Was this for real? It's hard to tell
Because it was such a beautiful mess we had got into
I'm going to overcome this, paper hearts can't win this time
And all along I should have known this wasn't your dream, it was mine
I know you wanted me to give up this life to be
Everything I was back when you had the hands my heart was in

I was never good at goodbye

Can I swallow this bottle whole?
So this brain in my head can forget your face

When we were starting out, you believed in me without a doubt
You were the finest thing to happen to a boy like me
It's so much harder now, I wanna try and tell you how
There is so much love in me, even though it's hard to see

And I was never good at goodbye
Can I swallow this bottle whole?
So this brain in my head can forget your face
Can I swallow this bottle whole?
Because I'd rather be dead than make more mistakes

Today I couldn't stay awake
Feels like I'm drowning in this firewater lake
I won't be sleeping much tonight
It's not the same without you lying by my side
(Right beside me)


I know you wanted me to give up my life to be
(Can I swallow this bottle whole?)
Everything I am when you're the only thing that I can see
(Can I swallow this bottle whole?)
I'm sorry but you're not the, not the only one for me
(So this brain in my head can forget your face)

You left me here beside myself
Left me with all the reasons why I was wrong for youEmbed
