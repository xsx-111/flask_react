Only One Lyrics
Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason

I feel so broken up (So broken up)
And I give up (I give up)
I just want to tell you so you know

Here I go, scream my lungs out
And try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one
That gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone

And something's breaking up (Breaking up)
I feel like giving up (Like giving up)
I won't walk out until you know
Here I go, scream my lungs out
And try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one
That gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one


Here I go, so dishonestly
Leave a note for you, my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go and you will find someone

Here I go, scream my lungs out
And try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one
No one like you
You are my only, my only one
My only one
My only one
You're my only one
You are my only, my only one14Embed
