Back Home Lyrics
Don't know what I was looking for
When I went home, I found me alone
And sometimes, I need someone to say
"You'll be alright, what's on your mind?"
But the water's shallow here, and I am full of fear
And empty-handed after two long years

Another sunny day in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance to feel it

Back home, I always thought I wanted so much more
Now I'm not too sure
Cause sometimes I miss knowing someone's there for me
And feeling free
Free to stand beside the ocean in moonlight
And light myself a smoke beneath the dark Atlantic sky

Another sunny day in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance to feel it
Everybody here is living life in fear of falling out of line
Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts just to pass the time
And the eyes get red in the back of your head, this place will make you blind
Put it all behind me and I'll be just fine

Another sunny day beneath this cloudless sky
Sometimes I wish that it would rain here
And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes
There's nothing real for them to see here

Another starry night in California
I'm sure back home they'd love to see it
But they don't know that what you love is ripped away
Before you get a chance
Before you get a chance to feel itEmbed
