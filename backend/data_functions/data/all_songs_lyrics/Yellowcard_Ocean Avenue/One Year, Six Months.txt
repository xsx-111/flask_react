One Year, Six Months Lyrics
Sew this up with threads of reason and regret
So i will not forget. I will not forget
How this felt one year six months ago
I know i cannot forget. I cannot forget

I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that i can share with you

I can tell that you don't know me anymore
It's easy to forget, sometimes we just forget
And being on this road is anything but sure
Maybe we'll forget, i hope we don't forget


So many nights, legs tangled tight
Wrap me up in a dream with you
Close up these eyes, try not to cry
All that i've got to pull me through is memories of you
Memories of you
Memories of you
Memories of you
I'm falling into memories of you and things we used to do
Follow me there
A beautiful somewhere
A place that we can share
Falling into memories of you and things we used to do2Embed
