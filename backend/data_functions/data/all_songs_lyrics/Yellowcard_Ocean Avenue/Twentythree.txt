Twentythree Lyrics
I got to tell you that he waited all his life
For someone like you to come make the wrong things right
I know he didn't have the answers all the time
But you can't tell me that you've never told a lie

We're almost twenty-three and you're still mad at me
So much that i said to you and i want to take it back now
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me
You tell the world i'm dead to you
But i know you want me back now

Was it fun for you to watch him fall apart? (watch me fall)
And suffocate him while you held him in your arms (in your arms)
I swear to god i wish he never let you in (let you in)
And i just hope we never hear from you again

We're almost twenty-three and you're still mad at me
So much that i said to you and i want to take it back now
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me
You tell the world i'm dead to you
But i know you want me back now
Wasted on you (wasted on you)
Wasted on you (so much time i've)
Wasted on you (wasted on you)
Wasted on you
On you
On you

Twenty-three and you're still mad at me
So much that i said to you and i want to take it back now
Twenty-three and it's so sad to me
You tell the world i'm dead to you
But i know you want me back nowEmbed
