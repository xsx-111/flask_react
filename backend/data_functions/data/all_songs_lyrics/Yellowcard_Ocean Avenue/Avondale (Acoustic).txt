Avondale (Acoustic) LyricsIf you're gonna rip my heart out
Could you use a knife that's dull
And rust in color
Once I die
There will be no way that you can cover
That scar. It's hard, I know
And if I get a little blood on, you
Finally the world will know you're guilty
Know you're wrong
Of taking everything you're gotten from me
No heart. It's hard, I know
Mighty King of Avondale
I just can't let this go
Real life ain't no fairytale
I just thought you should know
And when you're finished with the surgery, I
Really hope that you will turn to me, and
Tell me all about the fun you had
When you were cuttin up
You were cuttin up
Living like a fairytale
The Mighty King of Avondale
It all went to his head, this royalty
I stuck a knife into his back
Inventiveness is what I lack
He's always hanging up on loyaltyEmbed
