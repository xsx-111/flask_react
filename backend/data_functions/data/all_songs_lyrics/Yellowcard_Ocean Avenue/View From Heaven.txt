View From Heaven Lyrics
I'm just so tired
Won't you sing me to sleep?
And fly through my dreams
So I can hitch a ride with you tonight
And get away from this place
Get a new name and face
I just ain't the same without you in my life

Late night drives
All alone in my car
I can't help but start
Singing lines from all our favorite songs
And melodies in the air
Singing "Life just ain't fair"
Sometimes I still just can't believe you're gone

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

Feel your fire
When it's cold in my heart
And things sorta start
Reminding me of my last night with you
I only need one more day
Just one more chance to say
"I wish that I had gone up with you too"
And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here
You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I'd got to say goodbye

And I'm sure the view from heaven
Beats the hell out of mine here
And if we all believe in heaven
Maybe we'll make it through one more year
Down here

I hope that all is well in heaven
Cause it's all shot to hell down here
I hope that I find you in heaven
Cause I'm so lost without you down here
You won't be coming back
And I didn't get to say goodbye (goodbye)
I really wish I'd got to say goodbye1Embed
