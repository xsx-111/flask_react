Inside Out Lyrics
Here. A little sympathy for you to waste on me
I know you're faking it but that's okay
And i don't want to drag it out
Don't want to bring you down
I never wanted it to end this way

Even if i wanted to
I don't think that i'd get to you
There's nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again

Here. A little jealousy
I hope you think of me
Hope you wonder where i sleep at night (sleep at night)
Cause i feel like i'm inside out
You got me upside down
Maybe i was holding on too tight

Even if i wanted to
I don't think that i'd get to you
There's nothing i can say to you to make you feel alive again
So don't just say goodbye to me
Just turn your back away and leave
And if you're lucky i will be your last regret, your only friend
The two of us we dream like one
The two of us, the two of us
The two of us take breath like one
The two of us, the two of us 

I guess that this is over now
I guess it's called the falling out
But everyday i'm learning how to make it through this life i'm in
