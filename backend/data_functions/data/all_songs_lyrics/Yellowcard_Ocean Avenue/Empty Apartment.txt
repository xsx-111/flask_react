Empty Apartment Lyrics
Call me out, you stayed inside
The one you love is where you hide
Shot me down, as I flew by
Crash and burn, I think sometimes
You forget where the heart is
Answer "no" to these questions
Let her go, learn a lesson
It's not me, you're not listening
Now, can't you see? Something's missing
You forget where the heart is

Take you away
From that empty apartment you stay
And forget where the heart is, someday
If ever you loved me you'd say "it's okay"

Waking up from this nightmare
How's your life? What's it like there?
Is it all what you want it to be?
Does it hurt when you think about me
And how broken my heart is?

It's okay to be angry and never let go
It only gets harder the more that you know
When you get lonely, if no one's around
You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down
We came together, but you left alone
And I know how it feels to walk out on your own
Maybe some day I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend
