Life of a Salesman Lyrics
What's a dad for, Dad?
Tell me why I'm here Dad
Whisper in my ear that
I'm growing up to be a better man Dad
Everything is fine Dad
Proud that you were my Dad
Cause I know I'm growing up to be a better man

Father, I will always be
That same boy that stood by the sea
And watched you tower over me
Now I'm older
I want to be the same as you

What's a dad for, Dad?
Taught me how to stand Dad
Took me by the hand and
You showed me how to be a bigger man Dad
Listen when you talk Dad
Follow where you walk Dad
And you know I'll always do the best I can
I can
Father, I will always be (Always be)
That same boy that stood by the sea and
Watched you tower over me (Over Me)
Now I'm older I want to be the same as you
The same as you1Embed
