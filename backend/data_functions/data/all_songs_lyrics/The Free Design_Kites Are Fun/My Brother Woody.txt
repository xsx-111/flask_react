My Brother Woody LyricsHikin' a football between his knees
Runnin' to catch a pass
Climbin' up the friendly trees
Fallin' in the grass
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
Singin' a song and playin' guitar
Laughin' at every goof
Tryin' to touch the mornin' star
From the toolshed roof
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
Don't go away and leave the lights on
Curtain strings don't get yanked
Gotta watch out for Mom "the Bomb"
Be good enough not to get spanked
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
My brother Woody
