When Love Is Young LyricsWhen love is young, as fresh as dew
A song is sung, so warm and new
It winds its way, bursts into blue
An April day turned into June
Summer is born
I walk the fields, there's warmth above
The thought it yields is of my love
A lazy stream, its solitude
A summer dream, a quiet mood
Plays on my mind
The summer of a young girl's life
Is meant for love not pain or strife
A time for change (A time for change), a time to stay
To rearrange for another day
Another day
(Another day, another day)
(Another day, another day)
(Another day, another day)
Another dayEmbed
