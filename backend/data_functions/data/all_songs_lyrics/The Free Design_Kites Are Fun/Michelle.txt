Michelle LyricsMichelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle
Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I need to, I need to, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do I'm hoping you will know
Know, you'll know (What I mean)
Know, know, you'll know (What I mean)
Know, know, know
Michelle
Ma belle
Michelle, Michelle
I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you some how
Until I do I'm hoping you will know
Know, you'll know (What I mean)
Know, know, you'll know (What I mean)
Know, know, know
Michelle
Ma belle
Michelle, Michelle
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My MichelleEmbed
