Stay Another Season LyricsStay, stay another season
Wait, wait before we cry
Stay, stay another season
Wait, wait before we cry
The wrong is outside us
You're right, my friend, as always
You're right in what you think
You're wise, my love, I know it
The wine of truth we drink
For all that's pure must perish someday
The ship of warmth must surely sink
You're right, my friend, as always
You're right in what you think
But stay, stay
Wait, wait
Stay, stay another season
Wait, wait before we cry
Stay, stay another season
Wait, wait before we cry
The wrong is outside us
But inside us our love can never die
Each spring that ripens to fruitful summertime
Comes after that cold winter when tenderness is crime
No one can believe in love or conceive in love like ours
Some other season they'll get their way, regret their way
But let's be colorblind and numb to time while we may
You're right my friend as always
Yet, before our hearts we rend
Lets love while love is in us
Consider not the end
'Tis best we love the sun, noonday sun
Forget the frightful night
Accept the winter's coming
Yet, bask in summer's light
So stay, stay
Wait, wait
Stay, stay another season
Wait, wait before we cry
Stay, stay another season
Wait, wait before we cry
The wrong is outside us
But inside us our love can never die
Stay, stay another season
Wait, wait before we cry
Stay, stay another season
Wait, wait before we cry
The wrong is outside usEmbed
