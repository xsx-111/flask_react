Umbrellas LyricsI'm walking down the street in the rain
My umbrella high above my head
High above my head (High above my head)
Puddles along the wet sidewalks and gutters
Rain lightly falling from the sky
Lightly falling from the sky (Lightly falling from the sky)
Red and green and free design
Umbrellas are in bloom
Nourished by the rain
I'm walking down the street in the rain
My umbrella high above my head
High above my head (High above my head)
Through the clouds, the blackness and rain
I see the lightning strike as though it were pain
Rain falling hard on a sea of umbrellas
A colorful bottomless ocean
Then the wind it blows and it blows
I see the umbrellas bend, they creak and they groan
Gusting down alleys and through streets of cars
Causing unbottled, unspent commotion
I spy a patch of blue through a cloud
A patch of blue through a brandy shroud
Hopefully umbrellas hide and shrink and close
As the noonday sun peeps through the cloudsEmbed
