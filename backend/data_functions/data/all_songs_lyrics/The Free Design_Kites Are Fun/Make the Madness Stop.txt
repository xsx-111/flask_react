Make the Madness Stop LyricsCome along (Come along)
Come along (Come along)
Come along (Come along)
Come along
Follow the way that leads between madness and madness
Flowers on both sides, each side has weeds and gladness and sadness
Whoa, whoa, walk the way of love, eyes open
Fly the skies above with hope and heart and sense
Whoa, whoa, blow your mind but not completely
Make the madness stop
Deplete we must the store of hate immense
And grouping groping nonsense
Pathways are green and black and white and yellow and crimson
Walk on the rainbow flooded by both sides' truths and opinion
Whoa, whoa, walk the way of love, eyes open
Fly the skies above with hope and heart and sense
Whoa, whoa, blow your mind but not completely
Make the madness stop
Deplete we must the store of hate immense
And grouping groping nonsense
Honesty and purity, beauty and sincerity
Doesn't that sound corny?
Wish that I were corny
Whoa, whoa, walk the way of love, eyes open
Fly the skies above with hope and heart and sense
Whoa, whoa, blow your mind but not completely
Make the madness stop
Deplete we must the store of hate immense
And grouping groping nonsense
Walk the way of love, eyes open
Fly the skies above with hope and heart and sense
Whoa, whoa, blow your mind but not completely
Make the madness stop
Whoa, whoa, walk the way of love, eyes open
Fly the skies above with hope and heart and sense
Whoa, whoa, blow your mind but not completelyEmbed
