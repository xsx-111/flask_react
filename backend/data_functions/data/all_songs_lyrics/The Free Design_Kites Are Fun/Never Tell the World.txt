Never Tell the World LyricsNever tell the world, no, no, no
Never tell the world, no, no, no
Never tell the world, no, no, no
No
Never tell the world
Never give it reason
To mock a love like ours
Never sing our song
Keep it locked inside
Keep it just between us
Keep it secret never confide
Until they all have seen us
Never has the world complied
With a love that seems to reproach it
And every wrong-spoken word
That we've ever heard
Warns us
We'd better keep our cool
Our love's too precious
People hate a broken rule
People won't accept us
But someday the world might change
And a love like ours might belong
But until that day comes along
Never tell
Never tell the world
Never give it reason
To mock a love like ours
Never sing our song
Never tell the world
Never give it reason
To mock a love like ours
Never sing our song
Never tell the world, no, no, no
Never tell the world, no, no, no
Never tell the world, no, no, no
Never tell the world, no, no, no1Embed
