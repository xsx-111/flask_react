The Proper Ornaments LyricsBa-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ornaments of life, ornaments of life
Proper ornaments of life
There's your brand new car, sir
Here's your hat and gloves
There's your pretty wife, sir
Whom you almost love
There's your color TV set
And your impressive pad
There's your little baby girl
You're almost glad you had
Such a pretty dress, miss
Such a graceful walk
Bubbling femininity
Authoritative talk
There's your man, he's prominent
Treats you like a queen
All your little secrets kept
Your reputations clean
The proper ornaments of life
Gotta have status and a vacation
Have an intellectual education
Ornaments of life, ornaments of life
Proper ornaments of life
Fur coats, jewels and laces, bright red lipstick, big cars, money, tuxes and top hats
Hide behind the mask of clothes and makeup
Ornaments
There's your brand new car, sir
Here's your hat and gloves
There's your pretty wife, sir
Whom you almost love
There's your color TV set
And your impressive pad
There's your little baby girl
You're almost glad you had
What's behind that countenance?
What's behind the lace?
What is in your mind and heart
That's hidden by your face
Behind the ornaments in your life?
