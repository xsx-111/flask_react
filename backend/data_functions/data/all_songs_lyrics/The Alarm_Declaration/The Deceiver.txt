The Deceiver Lyrics
You are the power and the glory
You are the weakness in defeat
Like the rise and fall of the British Empire
You make me sick with your conceit

You are, you are the weakness
You are, you are, you are
You are the sickness that's in my soul
You are, you are, you are the maker
You are called greed and you're a cheat
You are, you are, you are the deceiver
You are not welcome in my life

You are the maker of illusions
You break up every dream we've ever made
And as I rise up from the ashes
Wouldn't you believe it?
You raise your ugly head
Have you no shame?

Too long, too long you have lain there
Too far, too long, too strong
Oh, I will break your hold
You are, you are, you are the maker
You are called greed and you're a cheat
You are, you are, you are the deceiver
You are not welcome in my life
You are, you are the weakness within us
You are, you are, you are
You are the sickness that's in my soul
You are, you are, you are the maker
You are called greed and you're a cheat (What prompted you to give it away?)
You are, you are, you are the deceiver (When it's all said and done)
You are called greed and you're a cheat (You are the downfall)
You are, you are, you are the deceiver (What prompted you to give it away?)
You are called greed and you're a cheatEmbed
