Third Light LyricsYour head on my shoulder
Two months you've been a soldier
I feel so sick inside
Two months you have been alive
So no one here knows your surname
No one knows from where you came
The Red Cross takes you to your grave
For which your government kindly pays
WHITE CROSS upon the hillside
There lies that unknown soldier
No one can remember your name
So here I stand by your graveside
The steel helmet lies upon your cross
They said you died for king and country
That's no comfort to the life you've lost
FIRST LIGHT
The sniper saw you
SECOND LIGHT
Took careful aim
THIRD LIGHT
He pulled the trigger on the gun
Dead dead dead
WHITE CROSS upon the hillside
There lies that unknown soldier
No one can remember your name
(So here beings the human harvest
Another war to end all wars
To give a life for rhyme nor reason
There are no words to justify the cause
So if our future lies in the scarlet fields
Who would be a patriot at the price of humanity?
WHO WOULD BE A PATRIOT AT THE PRICE OF HUMANITY?)
No, not me
NO NOT ME
WHITE CROSS upon the hillside
There lies that unknown soldier
No one can remember the
WHITE CROSS upon the hillside
There lies that unknown soldier
No one, no one, no oneEmbed
