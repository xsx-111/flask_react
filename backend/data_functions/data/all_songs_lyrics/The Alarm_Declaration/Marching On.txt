Marching On Lyrics
There's a young boy standing
Staring at the world
You know he can't control his anger
You can see it in his eyes
He's gonna smash the window
He's gonna tear down the walls
Hey mister, you don't understand it
Take a look at it through my eyes
These are the kids, they're powerless
So you tell them so
These are the kids, they're powerful
Don't say you haven't been told

(And we'll go)
Marching on
Hear our sound, hear our voice
We're growing stronger
(And we'll go)
Marching on
We're not alone and we're keeping on, we're
Marching on

Take a walk 'round your city walls
Before it all comes down
(Tumbling down)
Take a walk down any street
You're gonna feel the stares of us all
Can you feel it burning?
Shame is what it's called
Just look at what you have created
And think of all the people who hate you
These are the people that made you
When you said you cared for us all
These are the people who'll break you
Get prepared for the fall
(And we'll go)
Marching on
Hear our sound, hear our voice
We're growing stronger
(And we'll go)
Marching on
We're not alone and we're keeping on
Marching on

We're the young who stand up
We must never be silenced
We've gotta speak up now
For all our sakes
Let's lift our voices higher
Let's sing our song
Keep on marching, marching
And never forget
About the power on the right side
Fights the power on the left
We have got to stand together
Forget the east and west
So there's another voice crying in the ghetto
Another mouth to feed
Another heart beating in the ghetto
Another soul to set free
(And we'll go)
Marching on
Hear our sound, hear our voice
We're growing stronger
(And we'll go)
Marching on
We're not alone and we're keeping on
We're going Marching on

Keep on marching, marching, marching on
We must never be silenced
(Marching, marching, marching on)
Lift your voices higher, higher
(Marching, marching, marching on)
Sing now, sing now
(Marching, marching, marching on)
Lift up, lift up your voices
(Marching, marching, marching on)
(Marching, marching, marching on)
Our hearts must have the courage
To keep on marching onEmbed
