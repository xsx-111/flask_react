Tell Me LyricsAnd if you know what is the answer
Why don't you tell me
What does it feel like
To be free
What does it feel like
Take a look at the punks
On the run from all the ministers
Collecting for the criminals
And the judges or the blame
If you're innocent or you're guilty
Or you've never been given a chance
And you'll never find an answer
There's always, always, always, always
Just one more link to the chain
And if you've found
What you think you've been looking for
Don't look back
Because you won't find nothing
Anymore
No, I guess you won't find nothing
Take a look at the punks
On the run from all the ministers
Collecting for the criminals
And the judges or the blame
If you're innocent or you're guilty
Or you've never been given a chance
And you'll never find an answer
There's always, always, always, always
Just one more link to the chain
Just one more link to the chain
Just one more
(Just one more link to the chain)
Take a, take a, take a look
(Just one more link to the chain)
Take a look at the punks
(Just one more link to the chain)
At the ministers collecting
(Just one more link to the chain)
And there's always, always, always, always
Just one more link to the chainEmbed
