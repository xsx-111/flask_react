The Stand Lyrics
Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand

Oh, I have been out searching, and with the black book in my hand
I have looked between the lines that lie on the pages that I tread
I met the walking dude, religious, in his worn down cowboy boots
He walked liked no man on Earth, I swear he had no name (Had no name)
I swear he had no name

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down and make the stand

As I crawled beneath the searchlights
Looking through the floorboards of this life
I met Doctor Strangelove's cousin, he bore the marks of time
"Hey, Trashcan, where you going, boy? Your eyes are feet apart
Is that the end you're carrying? Shall I play the funeral march?" (Play the march)
Play the funeral march

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down and we'll make the stand

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down, we'll make the stand

When I looked out the window on the hardship that had struck
I saw the seven phials open, the plague claimed man and son
Four men at a grave in silence with hats bowed down in grace
A simple wooden cross, it had no epitaph engraved (It had no)
It had no epitaph engraved

Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on and make the stand
Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down and we'll make the stand
Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come on down and we'll make the stand
Come on down and meet your maker
Come on down and make the stand
Come on down, come on down
Come onâ€”Embed
