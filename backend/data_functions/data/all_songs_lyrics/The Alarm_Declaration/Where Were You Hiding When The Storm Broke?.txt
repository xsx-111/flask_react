Where Were You Hiding When The Storm Broke? Lyrics
Born into a war and peace
Forced to choose between the right and wrong
Each man kills the thing he loves
For better or for worse
Face to face with a ragged truth
Mixed up and torn in two
And turned your back on the only thing
That could save you from yourself

Where were you hiding (Four)
When the storm broke? (Winds)
When the rain began to fall? (Howl)
When the thunder and the lightning struck?
And the rain and the four winds did howl?

After all time building up
Comes inevitable knocking down (One by one)
Come receivers, liars, gamblers
Pickpocket entourage (Two by two)
Selling out is a cardinal sin
Sinning with a safety net (Three by three)
They say that all things come in threes
Well, here comes the third degree
Where were you hiding (Four)
When the storm broke? (Winds)
When the rain began to fall? (Howl)
When the thunder and the lightning struck?
And the rain and the four winds did howl?

All cards are marked
And all fates will collide
The truth is the truth
Or the truth is surely a lie
Get back in your shelter
If you can't come down off the fence
And one more question
Where were you?
Oh, where were you?

Where were you hiding (Four)
When the storm broke? (Winds)
When the rain began to fall? (Howl)
When the thunder and the lightning struck?
And the four winds did howl?
Where were you hiding (Four)
When the storm broke? (Winds)
When the rain began to fall? (Howl)
Where were you hiding (Four)
When the storm broke? (Winds)
When the rain began to fall? (Howl)
Where were you hiding?
Four winds howlEmbed
