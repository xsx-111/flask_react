Howling Wind LyricsLove on this wasteland holds no dominion
I refuse to lay me down
On the grapevine comes the saying
"Son, you'll reap whatever you sow"
I sow the seeds of my love
Deep undying true love I sow
There is beauty out there somewhere
I will leave no stone unturned
There's a guitar and a bugle
I hear the sound of distant drums
Fire and water rage through my mind
(Love on)
Love on this wasteland
I cannot find
And there is a HOWL HOWL HOWLING WIND
A ringing around my ears
And a wild wild wind is a blowing
Tearing down my tears
There is virtue truth abounding
Peace will come to everyman
And there's a landmark on the skyline
There is a sign standing in the road
Sail on my brother
Sail on through the night
(Love on)
Love on this wasteland is waiting on down the line
And there is a HOWL HOWL HOWLING WIND
A ringing around my ears
And a wild wild wind is a blowing
Tearing down my tears
Forty days in the desert sand
Forty nights on my hands and knees
Forty days in the howling wind
In the howling wind
Love on this wasteland holds no dominion
I refuse to lay me down
On the grapevine comes the saying
"Son, you'll reap whatever you sow"
I sow the seeds of my love, my love
Deep undying true love's what I sow
There's a HOWL HOWL HOWLING WIND
A ringing around my ears
And a wild wild wind is a blowing
Tearing down my tears
And there's a HOWL HOWL HOWLING WIND
A ringing around my ears
And there's a wild wild wind is a blowing
Tearing down my tearsEmbed
