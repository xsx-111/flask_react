M.T.V. - Get Off the Air Lyrics
(Fun, fun, fun in the fluffy chair
Flame up the herb, woof down the beer)
Hi, I'm your video DJ!
I always talk like I'm wigged out on quaaludes
I wear a satin baseball jacket everywhere I go
My job is to help destroy what's left of your imagination
By feeding you endless doses of sugar-coated mindless garbage!
So don't create
Be sedate
Be a vegetable at home
And thwack on that dial
If we have our way even you will believe
This is the future of rock and roll!
(MTV, get off the air!)

How far will you go?
How low will you stoop to tranquilize our minds with your sugar-coated swill?
You've turned rock and roll rebellion into Pat Boone sedation
Making sure nothing's left to the imagination

M.T.V, get off the
M.T.V, get off the
M.T.V, get off the air!
M.T.V, get off the
M.T.V, get off the
M.T.V, get off the air!
Get off the air!
See the latest rejects from the Muppet show
Shake their tits and their dicks as they lip-sync on screen
There's something I don't like about a band who always smiles
Another tax write-off for some schmuck who doesn't care!

M.T.V, get off the
M.T.V, get off the
M.T.V, get off the air!
M.T.V, get off the
M.T.V, get off the
M.T.V, get off the air!
Get off the air!
Get off the air!
Get off the air!

And so it was, our beloved corporate gods claimed they created rock video
Allowing it to sink as low in one year as commercial TV has in 25
"It's the new frontier," they say
"It's wide open, anything can happen"
But you've got a lot of nerve to call yourself a pioneer
When you're too god-damn conservative to take real chances
Tin-eared graph-paper brained accountants, instead of music fans
Call all the shots at giant record companies now, the lowest common denominator rules
Forget honesty, forget creativity
The dumbest buy the mostest, that's the name of the game
But sales are slumping, and no one will say why
Could it be they put out one too many lousy records?
M.T.V, get off the air now!1Embed
