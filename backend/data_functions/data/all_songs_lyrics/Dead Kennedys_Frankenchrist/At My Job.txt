At My Job LyricsIf your machine might slip a gear
Push this button to help it clear
Your time card says that your name's Joe
But we'll call you 6-3-0
I'm working at my job
I'm so happy
More boring by the day
But they pay me
All that time spent going to school
Just to end up following rules
I'm working at my job
I'm so happy
More boring by the day
But they pay me
Now it's time to take a break
Don't stray too far or you'll be late
Thank you for your service and a long career
Glad you gave us your best years
I'm working at my job
I'm so happy
More boring by the day
But they pay me1Embed
