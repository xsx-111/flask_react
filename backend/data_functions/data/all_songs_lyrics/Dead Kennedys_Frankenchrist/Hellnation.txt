Hellnation LyricsHellnation's what they teach us, profiting from greed
Hellnation's where they give us coke, heroin, and speed
Hellnation's when they tell you gotta go clean up your act
You're the one who dragged me here and now you drag me back
To this hellnation
Hellnation

Hellnation
Problem is few care
About the people in despair
If you help no one
You're guilty in this hellnation
Hellnation's when the president asks for four more fucking years
Hellnation's when he gets it by conning poor people and peers
Hellnation, got no choice, what's the point in trying to vote?
When this country makes war we all die in the same boat
In this hellnation
Hellnation
Hellnation
Hellnation
Problem is few care
About the people in despair
If you help no one
You're guilty in this hellnation
Problem is few care
About the people in despair
If you help no one
You're guilty in this hellnation
It's the only world we've got
Let's protect it while we can
That's all there is and there ain't no more
Hellnation, asking please for a nuclear freeze
So the unborn kids get their chance to live and breathe
Hellnation, asking aid for the minimum wage
So the kids of tomorrow don't wind up slaves to their trade
In this hellnation
Hellnation
Hellnation
Hellnation
Problem is few care
About the people in despair
If you help no one
You're guilty in this hellnationEmbed
