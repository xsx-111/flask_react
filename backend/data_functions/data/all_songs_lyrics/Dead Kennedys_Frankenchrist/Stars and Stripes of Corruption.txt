Stars and Stripes of Corruption LyricsFinally got to Washington in the middle of the night
I couldn't wait, I headed straight for the Capitol Mall
My heart began to pound, yahoo, it really exists
The American International Pictures logo
I looked up at that Capitol building, couldn't help but wonder why
I felt like saying "Hello, old friend"
Walked up the hill to touch it, then I unzipped my pants
And pissed on it when nobody was looking
Like a great eternal Klansman with his two flashing red eyes
Turn around, he's always watching
The Washington Monument pricks the sky
Flags for pubic hair ringed 'round the bottom
The symbols of our heritage lit up proudly in the night
Somehow fits to see the homeless people passed out on the lawn
So this is where it happens, the power games and the bribes
All lobbying for a piece of ass of the stars and stripes of corruption
Makes me feel so ashamed to be an American
When we're too stuck up to learn from our mistakes
Trying to start another Vietnam like fiddling while Rome burns at home
The boss says you're laid off, blame the Japanese
America's back, alright, at the game it plays the worst
Strip mining the world like a slave plantation
No wonder others hate us and the Hitlers we handpick
To bleed their people dry for our evil empire
The drug we're fed to make us like it is God and country with a bang
People we know who should know better
Howl "America rules, let's go to war!"
Business scams are what's worth dying for
But are the Soviets our worst enemy? We're destroying ourselves instead
Who cares about our civil rights as long as I get paid
The blind me-generation doesn't care if life's a lie
So easily used, so proud to enforce the stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down
Let's bring It all down
Let's bring it all down
Down, down, down, down, down
Tell me who's the real patriots, the Archie Bunker slobs waving flags
Or the people with the guts to work for some real change?
Rednecks and bombs don't make us strong, we loot the world, yet we can't even feed ourselves
Our real test of strength is caring, not the war toys we sell the world
Just carry on, thankful to be farmed like worms
Old glory for a blanket as you suck on your thumbs
Real freedom scares you 'cause it means responsibility
So you chicken out and threaten me
Saying, "Love it or leave it," I'll get beat up if I criticize it
You say you'll fight to the death to save your useless flag
If you want a banana republic that bad
Why don't you go move to one?
But what can just one of us do
Against all that money and power trying to crush us into roaches?
We won't destroy society in a day
Until we change ourselves first from the inside out
We can start by not lying so much
And treating other people like dirt
It's so easy not to base our lives on how much we can scam
And you know it feels good to lift that monkey off our back
I'm thankful I live in a place where I can say the things I do
Without being taken out and shot
So I'm on guard against the goons trying to take my rights away
We've got to rise above the need for cops and laws
Let kids learn communication instead of schools pushing competition
How about more art and theater instead of sports?
People will always do drugs, let's legalize them, crime drops when the mob can't price them
Budget's in the red, let's tax religion
No one will do it for us, we'll just have to fix ourselves
Honesty ain't all that hard
Just put Rambo back inside your pants
Causing trouble for the system is much more fun
Thank you for the toilet paper, but your flag is meaningless to me
Look around, we're all people, who needs countries anyway?
Our land, I love it too, I think I love it more than you
I care enough to fight the stars and stripes of corruption
Let's bring it all down
Let's bring it all down, let's bring it all down
If we don't try, if we just lie
If we can't find a way to do better than this, who will?Embed
