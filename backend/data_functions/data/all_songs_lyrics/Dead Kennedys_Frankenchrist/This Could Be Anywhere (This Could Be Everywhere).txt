This Could Be Anywhere (This Could Be Everywhere) LyricsCold concrete apartments
Rise up from wet black asphalt
Below them a few carcasses
Of the long-gone age of privacy
It takes a scary kind of illness
To design a place like this for pay
Downtown's an endless generic mall
Of video games and fast food chains
One by one, the little houses are bricked up and condemned
A subtle hint to move before the rats move in
This could be anywhere
Could be anywhere, everywhere
Those new kids at school seem cool
But dad says not to talk to them
Stick to your old friends, they're not our kind
So now there's lots of fights
So many people I know
Come of age tense and bitter-eyed
Can't create so they just destroy
Come on, let's set someone's dog on fire
Empty plastic culture slum, suburbia is a war zone now
Sprouting the kinds of gangs we thought we'd left behind
This could be anywhere
Could be anywhere, everywhere
Could be anywhere
Could be everywhere
Could be anywhere
Kids at school are taking sides
Along color and uniform lines
My dad's gone and bought a gun
He says he's fed up with the crime in this town
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
I hope I'm gone before it explodes
I linger late at night
Waiting for the bus
No amount of neon jazz
Could hide the oozing vibes of death
My dad's a vigilante now
He's bringing home these weird-ass friends
Like the guy who fires blanks at his TV
When Kojak's on
Or the guy who shows off his sub-machine gun to his sixteen year old daughter's friends
Whose sense of pride and hope is being in the police reserve
This could be anywhere
Could be everywhere, could be anywhere, everywhere
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
This could be anywhere
This could be everywhere
EverywhereEmbed
