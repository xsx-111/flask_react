Wild Honey Lyrics
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)

Mama, I'm telling you
As sure as I am standing here
She's my girl, and that's the way
I'm keeping it, now mama dear

No good will it do you
To stand there and frown at me
The girl's got my heart
And my love's comin' down on me
My love's comin' down since I
Got a taste of wild honey

(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
You know she's got the sweetness of a honey bee
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
Wild honey
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
She got it on and stung me good, yes siree
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
With all the other stud bees
Buzzin' all around her hive
She singled me out
Single-handed took me alive
Can you dig I'm gonna take my life
Eatin' up her wild honey?

(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)

Oh mama, she's sweeter
(Sweeter)
And sweeter
(And sweeter)
Sweeter, sweeter (Mmm)
(Good, good, good)
Sweet wild honey

(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
Let me tell you how she really got to my soul
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
It ain't funny
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
The way she makes me wanna sing a little rock and roll
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
There's nothing quite as sweet
As a kiss of wild honey
I break my back workin'
Just to save me some money
So I can spend my life with her
Sock it to me, wild honey

(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
Wild honey, she's mine
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
Oh, wild honey, she's mine
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)...1Embed
