Mama Says Lyrics
Eat a lot, sleep a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy
Eat a lot, sleep a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy
Eat a lot, sleep a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy
Eat a lot, sleep a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy

Never be lazy, be lazy

Eat a lot, sleep a lot, brush 'em like crazy
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy boy
