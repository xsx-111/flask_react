Winter is Coming LyricsI see the winter, she's crawling up the lawn
I feel her breathing beneath my palms
She tears the trees down while curses roll from her tongue
Got eyes like anvils and storms for lungs
Hiding in our house, sunburn in his mouth
Summer's in our basement now
Light beneath the door, light beneath the door
Just enough to keep us warm
Don't you let it out, don't you let it out
Just make sure he's always around
But we're all out of time, nothing left to decide
Pack your things up quick, this one can't be fixed
Leave the rest of it behind
We push through trees now, our house is covered in ice
Our breath falls from our mouths like tiny rain clouds
We tug on Summer, and he melts the snow at our feet
She's on our heels, there's never time to stop and sleep
I feel you breathing, I hear you curse my name
I hope that you'll forgive me one of these days
The sky is bleeding, the fog is thicker than walls
She's wrapped up in it, like cloth on a wrecking ball
Everything we stole, everything we broke
Everything we bought is gone
A couple dumb mistakes, bigger than we thought
Nothing left to do but run
If I could put it back, fill in all the cracks
Nothing there I wouldn't change
But wishing never helps, wishing never helps
Wishing never solved a thing
You were right
Yeah, you were right
You were right
Yeah, you were right1Embed
