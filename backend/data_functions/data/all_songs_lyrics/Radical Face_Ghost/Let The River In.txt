Let The River In LyricsYou, beneath the bed, I know all your tricks
I've seen you watching
I've seen you drifting away
I've seen you floating along
I've seen you disappear
Now, there ain't a cloud in sight
And through the snow and the branches
I can count all your teeth
Yeah I can count all your teeth
Now the bed's on fire and the ceiling's gone
And your mom and dad still sing the same old song
Don't scare me off now, I'm your only friend
Don't scare me off now, I'm your only friend
But now you're drifting away
Now you're floating along
And soon you'll disappear
I closed my eyes and saw my father's sins
They covered me like a second skin
I peeled them off, and sure I bled a bit
But now I'm free to sink my own damn ship
I cut my branch down from my family tree
To start a fire in the living room
Now the house is just ash, this time it's sink or swim
Let the river in
If blood is thicker than water
Then let the river in
We might drift a ways, but we've got thick skin
Let the river in
If blood is thicker than water
Then let the river in
We might drift a ways, but we'll find our way againEmbed
