The Strangest Things LyricsThe ghost inside my head, it never sleeps
It just rearranges thoughts and leaves me numb for weeks
But I'm okay, yeah I feel fine
Because I know there's more than one way to lose my mind
To lose my mind
Lose my mind
To lose my mind
The crows are at the fence, they never blink
They just sharpen all their claws and bare their twisted teeth
But I won't bend and I won't move
Don't have a lot left, just anger, and something to prove
So I can't lose
So I can't lose
So I can't lose
The cold spreads through the house
It bites my ears
I can't feel my hands or feet and I'm too scared to sleep
And now the ghosts are on the porch
Got knives in hands, oh no, I think I've seen this before
And I might lose
And I might lose
And I might lose
And all this time, I've been watching you sleep
And the strangest things have been happening to me, oh
And all this time, I've been watching you breathe
And the strangest things have been happening to me, ohEmbed
