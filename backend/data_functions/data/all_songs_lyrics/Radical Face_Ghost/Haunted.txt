Haunted LyricsI can hear the car
As it rumbles up the driveway
But I'm too scared to look
So I curl up beneath the window
And I pray they won't find me
And I pray that I'll keep still
I see your face in the glass
With branches growing from your mouth
You wear the moon like a halo
You wear the night like it's your coat
And you're always laughing
But you always look afraid
I think we're haunted
Hands against my eyes
I hear you crying in your sleep
I think we're haunted
Clouds are coming down the chimney
That we're never alone
And trees are growing through the living room
I think we're haunted
The moon is stuck in the ceiling
That we're swimming through ghosts
The rain is pouring on the dining room table
Yeah, I think we're haunted
The vines are growing up and down the walls
That we're never alone
The water's flooding on the kitchen floor
I think we're haunted
The woods are all taking it back
We've overstayed our welcome
It's time we were gone1Embed
