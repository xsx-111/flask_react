These Dreams LyricsOnce we were lovers
But some how things have changed
Now we're just lonely people tryin' to forget eachother's names
Now we're just lonely people tryin' to forget eachother's names
What came between us?
Maybe we were just too young to know
But now and then I feel the same
And sometimes at night I think I hear you callin' my name
Mmm hmm hmm these dreams
They keep me goin' these days
Once we were lovers
But that was long ago
We lived together then
And now we do not even say hello
We lived together then
And now we do not even say hello
What came between us?
Maybe we were just too young to know
But now and then I feel the same
And sometimes at night I think I hear you callin' my name
Mmm hmm hmm these dreams
They keep me goin' these daysEmbed
