One Less Set of Footsteps LyricsWe've been runnin' away from somethin' we both know
We've long run out of things to say and I think I'd better go
So don't be gettin' excited oh-when you hear that slammin' door
Cause there'll be one less set of footsteps on your floor in the mornin'
And we've been hidin' from somethin' that should have never gone this far
But after all it's what we've done that makes us what we are
And you've been talkin' in silence well if it's silence you adore
Oh there'll be one less set of footprints on your floor in the mornin'
Oh there'll be one less set of footsteps on your floor
One less man to walk in
One less pair of jeans upon your door
One less voice a-talkin'
But tomorrow's a dream away and today has turned to dust
Your silver tongue has turned to clay and your golden rule to rust
If that's the way that you want it well that's the way I want it more
Cause there'll be one less set of footprints on your floor in the mornin'
Oh there'll be one less set of footsteps on you floor in the mornin'Embed
