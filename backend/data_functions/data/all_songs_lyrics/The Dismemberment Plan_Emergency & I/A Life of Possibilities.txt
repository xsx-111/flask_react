A Life of Possibilities Lyrics
You dig down underground now
Through the soil, through the cooling clay
As the din fades above you
You're moving, you're secret, you're nowhere, it's all good
And no lights lead you onwards
And no signs point you on your way
Just earth in all directions
It's endless, it's mapless, no compass, no north star

You're all gone cause they can't find you
You're lost cause they don't know the way
They blame themselves, they blame each other
They're angry, they're sorry, they're worried, you don't care
The shovels scrape somewhere up there
They just want to know if you're okay
Morse code tapped with hammers
You hear it, you know it, ignore it, you're on your way

But at some point you've gotta come up for air
You wipe the rocks and mud, and dirt out of your hair
You're blind and queasy with a growing sense of despair
You don't know anyone
You look around yeah,  trying to find someone you know
You put your hand up in the air, you kinda wave hello
But if they do care, oh, they're not letting it show
This can't be new to you
There's a feeling coming back
Connected by a thread
It's pulling at your hands like a spider web
Like a kite that isn't there

If it's a life of possibilities
That pulls you away, that claws and tears
And challenges you to stay, well then
If it's a life of possibilities
That you've gotta live well, don't be surprised
When they don't remember you or simply don't want toEmbed
