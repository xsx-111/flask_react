8 1/2 Minutes Lyrics
Oh, launched all the world's nukes this morning
Hoping it would kick-start something
Some of them went off course and hit the moon instead
It was kinda pretty
Well, there hasn't been a whole lot of looting
On the other hand, oh, it's fucking freezing
Someone on TV said something about going underground
I guess we better start digging

What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes?
Was it mean, was it petty, or did you realize you were sorry
And that you love them?
What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes?
Was it mean, was it cruel, or did you realize you were sorry
And that you love them?

Well, I saw an astronomer break down on CNN
He said, "I'm a scientist, not your fucking clergyman!"
And no one's going nowhere 'cause their cars are all frozen
They give the power plants ten days
The sky is like a dome of black metal flake
And stars bleed together in phosphorescent lakes
And a dead black disk slides silently overhead
It's fucking beautiful is what it is
What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes?
Was it mean, was it petty, or did you realize you were sorry
And that you love them?
What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes?
Was it mean, was it selfish, or did you realize you were sorry
And that you love them?
Or did you realize you were sorry
And that you love them?
What were you doing for those eight and a half minutes?
Was it mean, was it selfish, or did you realize you were sorry
And that you love them?

When I die, I'm going to heaven!
Leave it all to the cockroaches and the 7-Elevens
But it'd be nice to think we could get it right down here just once1Embed
