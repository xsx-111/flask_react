Spider in the Snow Lyrics
The only thing worse than bad memories
Is no memories at all
From the age of 20 to 22 I had five friends
None of whose names I can recall
And as I would walk down K Street to some temping job
As winter froze the life out of fall
Yeah, I must’ve been having a ball, yeah

Different scene outside your window now
Same VCR, the same cats
Different people at the very same job
Similar alley, different rats
The trash goes out on a Tuesday now
You got to make a note about that
Yeah, this time you’re where it’s at, yeah

You can’t say it but I know that it’s in there
You don’t know it but I know that you’re scared
Obvious and lonely—a spider in the snow

Now you find the very same pit still yawns
Deep down within the very same gut
The very same ghosts still seem to haunt you down
Down those lines you always tried to cut
You thought you just might need a little change
And now you find you got nothing but
How can a body move the speed of light
And still find itself in such a rut?
You can’t say it but I know that it’s in there
You don’t know it but I know that you’re scared
Obvious and lonely—afraid to not let go
You can’t say it but I know it’s in there
You don’t know it but I know that you’re scared
Obvious and lonely—a spider in the snow3Embed
