I Love a Magician Lyrics
Oh, here we go again!

I love a magician
She can cut me in half
She can find quarters behind my ear
And make me laugh, one two one two
Is this thing on? Let’s assess
Oh yes, she’s the best. There is no contest
But I must confess that there are times like when
She floats me straight up in the air
Over thirty miles—I don’t care
Well maybe a little it can really stop
You from doing something cause you wonder
Oh, if they’d really drop you

She simply wiggles her nose
And disappears all my clothes
Really makes me wonder
Really makes me wonder, wonder
Now she vanished into thin air
And doesn’t see why I care
Really makes me wonder
Really makes me wonder now wonder now
I love a magician, she does things to
Keep me amused like when she sticks
My hair straight up in the air
For the benefit of her stuck-up friends
Well, I think it’s funny
But you know it’s a touchy subject

She likes to set me a trap
And makes me come with a clap
Really makes me wonder
Really makes me wonder, wonder
She says she can’t read my mind
I know she does all the time
Really makes me wonder
Really makes me wonder now wonder now

She simply wiggles her nose
And disappears all my clothes
Really makes me wonder
Really makes me wonder, wonder
Now she vanished into thin air
And doesn’t see why I care
Really makes me wonder
Really makes me wonder now wonder now
There are times I don’t know you at all, yeah yeah yeah
There are times I don’t know you at all, yeah
There are times I don’t know you at all, yeah yeah yeah
There are times I don’t know you at all, yeahEmbed
