What Do You Want Me to Say? Lyrics
I lost my membership card to the human race
So don't forget the face
'Cause I know that I do belong here
Go down the checklist let's see, feelings are good
Dishonesty is bad
And keeping it inside is worse still
You want a problem? Well, I guess we got one now
I really don't know how
There's injuns over every goddamn hill

What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To let you know that I do mean it?
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To let you know that I do mean it?
What do you want me to say, yeah, yeah?
(Hey, hey)

I see it coming from a million miles away
What else can I say?
The only way you know that I love you
And there's no eye-to-eye, just Moses on the mount
Or I'm in for the count
You need your man above or below you
I cannot cry at will but I do wish I could
'Cause it'd do you some good
When every joke I make is treason
There was a time when you could make me laugh at will
And you can do it still
But never is it for the right reasons, yeah
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To let you know that I do mean it?
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To let you know that I do mean it?
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to hear
To let you know that I do mean it?
What do you want me to say, yeah, yeah?
(Hey, hey, hey)

Check out, uh, ooh check out, uh, ooh
Check out, uh, ooh, check out, yeah
Check out, uh, ooh, check out, uh, ooh
Check out, uh, ooh check out, yeah

What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To let you know that I do mean it?
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to do
To let you know that I do mean it?
What do you want me to say?
What do you want to hear
To let you know that I do mean it?
What do you want me to say, yeah?3Embed
