You Are Invited Lyrics
I got it in the mail one morning
There was no return address
Just my name in gold leaf on the front
There was no time or location
There was really no info at all
No date no place no time no RSVP
But it said:

You are invited
By anyone to do anything
You are invited for all time

I didn’t think much about it
It seemed like a really dumb joke
But later that week it was Friday once again
So I took it down to a disco
That wouldn’t have me in a million years
I flashed it once and I was inside with a drink
I really didn’t stay too long there
'Cause no one was having much fun
I made my way to a party all the way across town
It was thrown by the friend of an ex-thing
I wasn’t sure if I should go
But when I got in the place there were smiles all up and down
I grabbed my ex in the kitchen
I told her I was sorry I came
But she looked at me with a glazed smile and said:
You are invited
By anyone to do anything
You are invited for all time
You are so needed
By everyone to do everything
You are invited for all time

I headed for home kinda early
The party wasn’t all that great
I saw my neighbor out crying on his front porch
I stopped to see what his deal was
I didn't catch much through the sobs
Something about a party and he didn’t go
I thought about it for a second
With the invite in my hands
I threw it down at his feet and I said:

You are invited
By anyone to do anything
You are invited for all time
You are so needed
If you really want to go
You are invited for all time
For all time6Embed
