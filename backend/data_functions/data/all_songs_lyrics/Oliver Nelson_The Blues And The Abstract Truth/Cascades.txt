Cascades LyricsThe flashlights came out, the sound of the move
The wet of the ground, you're starting to lose
You took every breath, you've traced all my steps
To start in the streets and end what is leftI know that this is gonna leave you now
I know that this is gonna take you down
I know that this is gonna take you outAnd I am everywhere, everywhere
I am all you need to know
And I am everywhere, everywhere
I am all you need to knowThe house that I know, the flags they will blow
The races are where, the current will go
The threats I obey, the summer that fades
Will start in the streets and end in my veinsI know that this is gonna leave you now
I know that this is gonna take you down
I know that this is gonna take you outAnd I am everywhere, everywhere
I am all you need to know
And I am everywhere, everywhere
I am all you need to knowLosing all control
Losing all control this time you'll find
Losing all control
Losing all control you fall behindI am everywhere, everywhere
I am all you need to know
And I am everywhere, everywhere
I am all you need to knowAnd I am everywhere, everywhere
I am all you need to know
And I am everywhere, everywhere
I am all you need to knowEmbed
