Rugged Ruff Lyrics (x2)
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back

I got it hemmed
Mad methods to microphone mechanism from inner city
Curriculum to cuttin' edge for heads like circumcisions in your mental zone
I'm sly-er than Stallone basic instincts like Sharon Stone pockets Puffy-er than Combs
Calibers narrated rate supreme elevation
Fly-er than aviation plus freaky as dominatrix
Dramatics are manifested thought spreadin' like infection at pinnacle of perfection brain runs on fuel injections
Cyphers are intercepted like plays by quarterbacks bare witness to the fitness I be layin' on the wax

Compositions be causin' calamities rapidly, what MC would dare take a
Stab at thee vocabulary mastery, presented retention extended through
Iller style invented brain cells excel like V6 engines when I be
Enterin' - grammatical vortexes twistin' like rolodexes context is
Randomly selected ran like red lights by eager paramedics majestic
Verbal fragments tagged the graphics that wreck more havoc on niggas
Cabbages than semi automatic, plus automated but never faded datum kick
In verbatim related to hip-hop
 (x2)
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
In stereo phonic or mono my lingo tingle topics revolves around
Science of optics and poses as nuances scripture glitters like
Diamonds or sparkle like magnesium -premium equates the medium that
Blows me up like helium histionics provided pumped up more Jam than
Technotronix prime and mo' toxic than hydrocarbon in dioxin rupture
Rhythms with quartz precision deletin' jumble diction I rips it in repetition
Like salots in Hinduism
 (x5)
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic backEmbed
