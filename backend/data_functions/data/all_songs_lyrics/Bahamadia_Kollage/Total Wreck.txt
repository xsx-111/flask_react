Total Wreck Lyrics
(Samples)
I know you don't like me singing this
But I can... Get out !

I take the blast off from the boom chest area
First I  from mountain
in my stid-i'll hops
At the top like fizz and soda pop
The effect of my flics hit you like a judo chop
And then I get deeper than the boss with the phrase
 'Cause I'm amazing, get
Fat Like Joe when I swing it
Smokes the microphone like L when you sting it
Bussin with the fam'
Goddamn the rugged rough
And the (?) stay stuffed
Like the girl when she knocked-up
Plus tuff to tangle with
When I get mental
And burn like a prostitutes genitals
Dangerous with the 1,2 check
Bahamadia, can I get total wreck?
(Samples)

Likes ta
Grasp a hold to mic control
In a single bound
While the juvenile with the court list
Fling your melody at me & imma floss it
Launch your metaphor
Upon  lovely and gorgeous
When angry skills pass the point of 
That's how I feel when  is not good enough adjective
So fade to black
The new kids back on the block
Heart like cement, rock op
Without the nelly, blowing up like the daddy belly
Constant finesse as my flow varies
Dangerous with the 1,2 check
Bahamadia, can I get total wreck?

(Samples)

Rhymes exiting from the pill
Be 3D graphic, drastic
The Method Man couldn't stop my madness
I'm optimistic like the sounds of blackness
The voice wackiness and wet spots on the mattress
When I give it to your man in your bed
'Cause I'm kinky as the dreads on Ziggy Marley's head
Just kidding
But I bust ass like I shouldn't
When I flows on
Like a 16 once bottle of Ev-i-on
Words absolutely gone
And I'm sober like the horn on the head of a unicorn
Back in Philly people say that I'm the dawn
And the buzz was the first
But my face represented on
Dangerous with the 1,2 check
Bahamadia, can I get total wreck?
