Liberty Lyrics
Heads Up
Truth is the one creation
Faith is the flame of nations
All for the life and love of liberty
Peace is the path of ancients
Time is the fruit of patience
All for the life and love of liberty
Victory
Harmony
Endlessly, under God
This we pledge
With our very breath
To the Universe, under God
Love is the one creation
Faith is the flame of nations
All for the love of God
All for the love of God
All for the love of God
Liberty
We may be human
But we're still animalsEmbed
