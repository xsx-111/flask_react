For the Love of God LyricsThere is no religion
There is no reality or lack of reality
There is no start or finish
There is no me or you
There is only everything
And the only thing that is that everything
Is Divinity itself
And it is all for the love of God

Walking the fine line between Pagan and ChristianEmbed
