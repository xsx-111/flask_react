And We Are One LyricsI’m over here, I see you
I’m very near, I feel you
I hold your hand, I’m with you
I understand, I know you
I’m in our bed, I hold you
It feels so good, I touch you
When I awake, I breathe you
I touch your face, I kiss you
And if I call, I’ll hear you
And if I fall, I’ll catch you
You are my all, I am you
And we are oneEmbed
