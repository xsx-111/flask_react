Lovers In Love Lyrics
Crawl from the fire into the pan
What we don't need, hell will demand
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Well, I'm not in need therefore don't demand
And what hell can sell you I can't defend
Higher, higher, higher, higher
Higher, higher, higher, higher

And if another lover takes their love away from you
Be careful with your mind and what you're bound to do

Lovers in love, lovers in love
Love (Love), love (Love), love (Love)
Love (Love), love (Love), love (Love)
Love (Love), love (Love), love (Love)
Lovers loving love just like these lovers are loving love in love
Lovers loving love just like these lovers are loving love in love

And if another lover takes their love away from you
Be careful with your mind and what you are bound to do
Lovers in love, lovers in love
Lovers in love, lovers in love
And if we make it, I'll come back
And if we make it, I'll come back
Lovers loving love just like these lovers are loving love in love
Lovers loving love just like these lovers are loving love in love

Lovers in love (Higher, higher, higher)
Lovers in love (Higher, higher, higher)
Lovers in love (Higher, higher, higher)
Lovers in love (Higher, higher, higher)Embed
