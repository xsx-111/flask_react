Mornings Lyrics
Mornings go best with sunrise
The sunrise I used to see but never see now
If I was waiting, we'd build it all up
We'd look all around 'til we find, we find

The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the crack in the sky threatened to fall
Still, I don't believe, no I don't believe
We'll be just fine, we'll be just fine


The future was born with a sunrise
The sunrise that builds into days and even more years
And as it rolls burning, burning up trails
We look all around 'til we find, we find

The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the crack in the sky threatened to fall
Still, I don't believe, I don't believe
We'll be just fine, yeah, we'll be just fine
The sun it rose up from the belly of sea
Found his bedding up in those clouds where it hung for years
Still, I don't believe, while colors rained
And poured from the cotton bound pools and the drips
Those drips stained us all, painted us all
Still, I don't believe

The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through that crack in the sky
I don't believe, I don't believe
The people found the mountain
Climbed up from that hole in the ground
Through the crack in the sky
I don't believe, I don't believe

That we'll be just fine, we'll be just fine, we'll be just fine
I don't believe, no, I don't believe, no, I don't believe1Embed
