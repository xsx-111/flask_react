Work All Day Lyrics
If you work all day, you keep the rhythm through the night
Work all night, keep the rhythm through the day
Sell that soul, you'll be burning up right
Got no soul, well that's fine, all right
If you work all day, you keep the rhythm through the night
Work all night, keep the rhythm through the day
Sell that soul, you'll be burning up right
Got no soul, well that's fine, all right
All I've ever known is true

We'll pick it up, and pack it up, and put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left for you
We'll pick it up, and pack it up, and put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left of you

You keep the rhythm through the night
You need a little money, keep it working, all right
Help that soul, a little help may do some right
Need that soul, well that's fine, all right
Work all day, keep the rhythm through the night
Work all night, keep it working, all right
Sell that soul, well that's fine, all right
Sell that soul, well that's fine, all right
All I've ever known is true
We'll pick it up, and pack it up, and put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left for you
We'll pick it up, and pack it up, and put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left of you


I pick it up, and pack it up, and put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left for you
We'll pick it up, and pack it up, and put it in a bag
Stack it up like cinnamon, we'll get it real fast
Until there's nothing left of you
Until there's nothing left of you3Embed
