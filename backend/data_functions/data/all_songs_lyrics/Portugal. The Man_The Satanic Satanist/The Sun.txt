The Sun Lyrics
If you look real high you just might find
Sitting in the stars, glistening, glistening
Waiting for the band to come
Just waiting for the man to come
Oh, I wonder

Slip on down from that Sun to climb
Down to Earth and down to things like time
'Cause we are all, we are all just lovers
Born of Earth and light like all these others

If you're talking to the Moon
The Moon might sing about the universe
Shouting out: "I don't need, I don't need time"
I breathe in time

Where, where are we now?
Where, where are we now?

Slip on down from that Sun to climb
Down to Earth and down to things like time
'Cause we are all, we are all just lovers
Born of Earth and light like all these others
If you're looking for the river just find the mouth
It is grinding like gnashing teeth foaming out, foaming out
Mixing up the hell to come, just mixing up the hell to come
And it's fixing up to swallow me whole
It's fixing up to swallow me whole
It's fixing up to swallow my soul
Fixing up to swallow me whole

Slip on down from that Sun to climb
Down to Earth and down to things like time
'Cause we are all, we are all just lovers
Born of Earth and light like all these others

Where, where are we now?
(We are all, we are all lovers)
Where, where are we now?
(We are all, we are all lovers)
Where, where are we now?
(We are all, we are all lovers)
Where, where are we now?
(We are all, we are all lovers)2Embed
