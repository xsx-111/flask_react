Do You Lyrics
Do you, do you understand the people that we are?
And do you believe right from the start?
And do you see that everybody needs?
And do you feel we're burning in that hell?
Yeah, we'll make it here

Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear?

Do you, do you fear the marching of the lamb?
And do you believe there is loyalty in man?
And do you see when others turn away?
And do you hear it swimming in that head?
Yeah, we'll make it here

Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear?
He came down from the moon
And rained down on all of us
Rained down on all of us
And everyone was saved
He fell into the sea
Just to swim around
Just to feel the clouds on the way down
And everyone was saved
And everyone was saved
And everyone was saved

Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear? (Did you find?)
Did you find your fear?1Embed
