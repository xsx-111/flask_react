Intravenous Agnostic Lyrics
Into a vein exhibit the derelict
A secular mosaic distracted at birth
A Cubist abstraction let it live forever
Narcissism so lonely so live by the sea
What a mess

Cosmetic - polemic
Distinguished by relics
Destructive aesthetic
Intravenous agnostic
Intravenous

Brutality is needed in capitalist society
Television abandoned my very entity
Nature failed me but then it made me
We all pray for pluralist babies


Dismayed - dispossessed
Life becomes Calvinist
So sparkle and believe
Linguistics die easily
Intravenous agnostic
IntravenousEmbed
