Found That Soul Lyrics
Show me a wonder
You can't be sure of
I exist in a place
A self-made vacuum
But still stranded here
With all the scum
So clean - so lost - so beautiful

But I found that soul
Yeah I found that home
But I found that soul
But I found that soul
Yeah I found that now
But I found that soul

Not a subject
Not a subject am I
Sick and pale
But strangely alive
Broken blood vessels
Line my cheeks
Reflections look bad
And somehow unreal

Show me a wonderEmbed
