Wattsville Blues Lyrics
I got the Wattsville blues
I got nothing to lose now baby
I got the Wattsville blues
I got nothing to lose now baby
Time is going on
Time is leaving me
I got the Wattsville blues
I got the Wattsville blues now baby

But I still love the smile on your face
But I still love the sense of this place
I'm so happy I know I can never leave
Even though my, my brain it fucking bleeds


But I still love the smile on your face
But I still love everything about this place
I'm so happy I know I can never leave
There's a part of me that will never leave
But I still love

I got the Wattsville blues
I got nothing to lose now baby
I got the Wattsville blues now baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Wattsville blues
Don't want no friends
Don't want no
Don't want no friends
Don't want useless fuckers knocking at my door
Poxy fucking assholes following me
Don't you understand that I fucking despise
Every single living organism?
I'm deadEmbed
