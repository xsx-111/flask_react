Epicentre Lyrics
We use ourselves like politicians
For all the money and indecision
Indecision

Feels like there's no escape
Except through my hate
Second hand germ warfare
Denied oxygen everywhere

Like a stunned fox - with memory loss
A sad numb creature - I worship the painkiller
It is my epicentre

Non-existent energy adrenalin my God
Still clinging to the umbilical chord - umbilical chord
I'm breaking and I'm shaking - so delete the feeling
Beneath the real thing
Delete the feeling


I'm sleeping myself away
Into the blurred life of yesterday
I'm tip-tip-a-tapping tip-tip-a-tapping
My nerves are destroyed


You don't drink - you don't get high
So make sure you take your medicine boy
This is my epicentre

(Happy black days, here's the summer)
(Here's the summer)Embed
