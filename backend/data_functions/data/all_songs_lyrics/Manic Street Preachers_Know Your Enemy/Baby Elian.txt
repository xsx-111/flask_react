Baby Elian Lyrics
Blockades won't win you more votes
A Cuban adjustment act
Offer the world a dream
Dress it up - it's blackmail
Internal matter they say
For two million dollars a day
Maybe a future in film
But Cuban boxers still win

Kidnapped - to the promised land
The Bay Of Pigs
Or baby Elian
Operation - Peter Pan
America
The Devil's playground

Baby Elian
Baby Elian

Across the unfair divide
Where black will never meet white
So read my token lips
As if they never exist
You cannot buy a nation
Not even Miami mob
We follow a shining path
That you will never destroy

You don't just sit in a rocking chair
When you've built a revolution
You don't just sit in a rocking chair
When you've built a revolution
