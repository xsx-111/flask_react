Just a Kid Lyrics
Afraid of the sun
So afraid of the sky
Touch it and taste it
But don't reach too high
Bewildered but then
Then so uncomplicated
All these feelings
Not fully created

Just a kid amongst the autumn leaves
A kid kicking around with no worries
Just a kid searching through the debris
Just a kid acting like I used to be
Just a kid acting like I used to be

Afraid of the sun
So afraid of the sky
Touch it and taste it
But don't reach too high
Hurting and yearning
And yet so carefree
Waking and dreaming
The world at my feet
Just a kid amongst the autumn leaves
A kid kicking around with no worries
Just a kid searching through the debris
Just a kid acting like I used to be
Just a kid acting like I used to be

Just a kid amongst the autumn leaves
A kid kicking around with no worries
Just a kid searching through the debris
Just a kid acting like I used to be
Just a kid acting like I used to beEmbed
