His Last Painting Lyrics
The nothing in me
The apostle in me
No interpretation
For the heart of me

I can't see right from my wrong
I've loved so much that I can't go on

It's not my life anymore
Don't speak the truth anymore
All of the hope and the dreams
Ripped right open at the seams


Seems like I've lost myself
To everybody and everything else
I've lied again today
People laugh at it all the time



The nothing in me
The nothing in me, the apostle in me
No interpretation for the heart in me
The nothing in me, the apostle in me
The nothing in meEmbed
