We Are All Bourgeois Now Lyrics
There's something wrong somewhere here
So through unclean streets I made my way
With holes in my shoes
And my children asleep at my feet
I paid my way
In every town on the way
The people looked grey the buildings looked healthy
But one day I met a man
With money to spare
He said he would tell me how it is
The state he began
Has been propping up people too long
For far too long
We all got lazy and couldn't be bothered
To make our way through the world
But we are all bourgeois now
Once there was class war
But not any longer

Because baby we are all bourgeois now
So go out and make your way in the world
We're free to choose
We're all free to choose
We're free to choose
In booming Britain we all work together
To raise ourselves in the world
Each of us knows someone
Who has done well for themselves
So well for themselves
"Thank you," I said as I left
I'll be on my way, I see how it is

We are all bourgeois now
And somehow I'll raise myself through the world
I'm free to choose
We're all free to choose
I'm free to choose

We're all bourgeois now
We're bourgeois nowEmbed
