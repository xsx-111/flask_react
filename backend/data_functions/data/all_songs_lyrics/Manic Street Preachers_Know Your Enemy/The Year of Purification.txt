The Year of Purification Lyrics
Detoxification
Purification
The ravaged corner
Cold and embittered

Run away - run away as fast as you can
From anything that needs discipline

The year of purification

Deification
Depopulation
Crescendo of craving
Sullen and distorted


The year of purification
The year of
The year of purification
The year of purification
What have I said?
What have I said again?
I regret everything
Moral little shit-kickers
Liberal asinine pricks
