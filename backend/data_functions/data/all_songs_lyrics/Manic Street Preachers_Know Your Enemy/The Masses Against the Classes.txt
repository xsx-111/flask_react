The Masses Against the Classes Lyrics
"The country was founded on the principle that
The primary role of the government is to protect
Property from the majority and so it remains"
1, 2, 3, 4

Hello it's us again
We're still so in love with you
And yes we mean it too
Yes we're so in love with you
Hello it's us again
You thought you were our friends
Success is an ugly word
Especially in your tiny world

The masses against the classes
We're tired of giving a reason
When the future is what we believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together

So can you hurt us anymore
Can you feel like it was before
Or are you lost forever more
Messed up and dead on alcohol
Hello and fond farewell my dear
I hope you hear this nice and clear
Our love is unconditional
Our hate is yours to feed upon
The masses against the classes
We're tired of giving a reason
When the future is what we believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together
The masses against the classes
We're tired of giving a reason
When the future is what we believe in
We love the winter, it brings us closer together

"A slave begins by demanding justice
And ends by wanting to wear a crown"Embed
