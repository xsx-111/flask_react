Miss Europa Disco Dancer Lyrics
Miss Europa disco dancer
Feel the drug of your persona
Miss Europa disco dancer
I'm in heaven when I see you
Miss Europa disco dancer
Favourite son and favourite daughter
Miss Europa disco dancer
Suck - suck - suck up all of your power

So serene, the world turns blue
Heads are spinning - it feels so good
It's poetry, sheer poetry
The way you destroy your beauty

Miss Europa disco dancer
Brutaly becomes a no hoper
Miss Europa disco dancer
Had your luck and had your chances
Miss Europa disco dancer
I never reached the supernova
Miss Europa disco dancer
Wake up drunk and then fall over
So messed up, the world turns grey
All washed up with debts to pay
It's agony, sheer agony
The way your life just fades away
