Dead Martyrs Lyrics
Dead martyrs
All stigmartyrs
Dead heroes
For fear is zero
Dead martyrs
Always take it further
Dead heroes
Know no fear

Living for some happiness
Find nothing that satisfies
Had a beginning but it got no end

Got no future
Just dead stars for dead eyes
Got no future
Just dead stars for dead eyes
Got no future

Dead stars are always the blackest
Dead heroes the living empty
Dead martyrs hang on forever
Dead martyrs always take it further
