My Guernica Lyrics
I'm small and I'm tired
I'm blurred to bits and wired
I'm nothing in this universe
Nothing but pieces of dust

Appearing in more repeats
The mirror man has seen defeat
Hide away, be old and grey
Alfred J. Prufrock would be proud of me

Keep it together
Hold it together
Keep it together
Hold it together

Little someone in my own
Little Guernica
Sleep so heavy that it's out of the question
Little someone in my own
Little Guernica
Wake up and pour myself another ice-breaker
Going now so happy and so loose
Making bigger holes in my stomach
Losing, losing, split down the middle
With no end and no beginning

I'm small and I'm tired
I'm blurred to bits and wired
I'm nothing in this universe
Nothing but pieces of dust

Keep it together
Hold it together
Keep it together
Hold it together

Little someone in my own
Little Guernica
Sleep so heavy that it's out of the question
Little someone in my own
Little Guernica
Wake up and pour myself another ice-breaker
Keep it together
Hold it together
Keep it together
Hold it together

Little someone in my own
Little Guernica
Sleep so heavy that it's out of the question
Little someone in my own
Little Guernica
Wake up and pour myself another ice-breaker
Ice-breaker
Ice-breaker
Ice-breaker
