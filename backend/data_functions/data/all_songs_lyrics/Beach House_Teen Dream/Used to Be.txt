Used to Be Lyrics
You are coming home, are you still alone?
Are you not the same as you used to be?
As the sun grows high and you serve your time
Does each day just feel like another lie?
Now you know, is it just for show?
Just a foolish game that you hide behind?
Don't forget the nights when it all felt right
Are you not the same as you used to be?

Used to be
Used to be

In an endless night could you feel the fright
Of an age that was and could never be?
So we hold it close when we feel the most
Like a love that we could not leave behind
Turn the wheel to each way we feel
'Til I'm lost and I cannot find you there
Don't forget the nights when it all felt right
Are you not the same as you used to be?

Used to be
Used to be
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now
Coming home any day now
Any day now, any day now1Embed
