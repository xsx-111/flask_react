Take Care Lyrics
Stand beside it, we can't hide the way you make us glow
It's no good unless it grows
Feel this burning, love of mine
Deep inside the ever spinning
Tell me, does it feel?
It's no good unless it's real
Hillsides burning, wild-eyed turning 'til we're running from it

I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two

You say swimming in the lake, we'll come across a snake
It is real and then it's fake
Feel its heartbeat, feel what you heat
Far so fast, it feels too late

I'd take care of you if you'd ask me to
In a year or two

I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true
I'll take care of you, take care of you, that's true29Embed
