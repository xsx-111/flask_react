Real Love Lyrics
I met you
Somewhere
In a hell
Beneath the stairs
There's someone in that room
That frightens you
When they go boom
Boom, boom, boom
The color you say is black
Is the one you might lack
In the size of your eyes
Is there a
Righteous prize?

Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I met you, I met you

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh

There's something wrong
With our hearts
When they beat pure
They stand apart
In the black room, the light
Watch the seabird fall
Real love
It finds you
Somewhere with your back to it
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
I met you, I met you

Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh

We know, we know
We belong
By the street
And to the dawn
We know, we know
We belong
By the street
And to the dawn
We know, we know
We belong
By the street
And to the dawn
We know, we know
We belong
By the street
And to the dawn5Embed
