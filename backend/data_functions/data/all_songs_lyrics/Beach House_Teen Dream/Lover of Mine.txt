Lover of Mine Lyrics
You hear my cry, lover of mine
No tear in the eye or fear in my mind
The forest is thick and we don't recognize
We parted our lips and we reached from inside

In a wide open field, we know we can feel
Awake and unreal
Off to nowhere, off to nowhere
Off to nowhere

Need more people to be satisfied
With no fear of a god and a prayer for the night
You come into our minds and you rush through our lives
We parted our lips and reached from inside

In a wide open field, we know we can feel
Awake and unreal
Off to nowhere, off to nowhere
Off to nowhere

The only thing you've got (Off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it
The only thing you've got (Off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it
The only thing you've got (Off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it
The only thing you've got (Off to nowhere)
You know you're better off without it
Youngest fire, you decide
You decide what is right
Youngest fire, who decides?
We decide what is right
Near yet so far, isn't it?
The only thing you've got
You know you're better off without it
Near yet so far, isn't it?
The only thing you've got
You know you're better off without it
Near yet so far, isn't it?
The only thing you've got
You know you're better off without it
Near yet so far, isn't it?
The only thing you've got
You know you're better off without it
Near yet so far, isn't it?
The only thing you've got
You know you're better off without it8Embed
