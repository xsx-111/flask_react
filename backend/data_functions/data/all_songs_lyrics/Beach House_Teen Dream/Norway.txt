Norway Lyrics
We were sleeping 'til you came along
With your tiny heart
You led us in the wooden house
To share in all the wealth

Don't you know it's true?
Norway
Norway

Seven figures leap the hungry mouths
The beast, he comes to you
He's a hunter for a lonely heart
In the season of the sun

Don't you know it's true?
Norway
Norway

Where you thinking that you're gonna run to now
With the beating of a tiny heart?
You hang onto the things that you're supposed to say
Millions of stars, they hold onto your breath
Norway
Norway
Norway
