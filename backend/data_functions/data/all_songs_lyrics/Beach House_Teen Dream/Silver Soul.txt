Silver Soul Lyrics
Gather matters of the heart, so we can act a fool
It's incomplete without you
The silver soul is running through
It's a vision, complete illusion, yeah

The needle on the spinning wheel collecting silver coil
It gathers heat without you
Whether or not you're turned from it
It's a quick turn to let us in

It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again

The bodies lying in the sand, they're moving in the dark
It is so quick to let us in
Feel it moving through our skin
It's a sickness, infinite quickness

It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again
It is happening again13Embed
