Better Times Lyrics
I want you to know the truth
'Cause I've been around before
Thought I wasn't looking anymore

Been a fool for weeks
'Cause my heart stands for nothing and your soul's too weak
Got a will that's been around for days
Goes far, if you want it, it needs to behave

But then you, you come around
Big mistake

I don't want to know, I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know of Better times

Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
And you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar?
Running around 'cause you beat yourself up
And you made a crack and the one that you love is gone
How much longer can you play with fire
Before you turn into a liar?
I've been around before
Thought you weren't looking anymore

But then we, we come and go, go up in smoke

I don't want to know, I don't want to know
We don't need a sign to know, Better times3Embed
