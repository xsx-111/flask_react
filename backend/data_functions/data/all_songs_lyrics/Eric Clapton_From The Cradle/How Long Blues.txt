How Long Blues Lyrics
How long, baby, how long
Has that evening train been gone?

How long
How how long
Baby, how long?

Went to the station, didn't see no train
Down in my heart, I have an aching pain


I feel disgusted, I feel so bad
Thinking about the good time that I once had had


I could see the green grass growing on the hill
I ain't seen no greenback on a dollar bill

You're going to be sorry, you'll feel so blue
When you want me, baby, I declare I won't want you


Don't have no money for to ride the train
I would ride the rods, baby, to be with you again


How long, baby, how long
Must I keep my watch in pawn?
