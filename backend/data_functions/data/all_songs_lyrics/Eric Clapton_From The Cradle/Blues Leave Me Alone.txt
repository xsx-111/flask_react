Blues Leave Me Alone LyricsThe blues, blues trying to drive me away from home
The blues, blues trying to drive me away from home
Had the blues so bad, blues followed me all day long
The blues, blues won't let me take my rest
The blues, blues won't let me take my rest
My mind is rambling like a wild geese out in the west
Well, you're my all day steady, baby, you're my midnight dream
Yes, you're my all day steady, baby you're my midnight dream
I love that woman better than anyone I've ever seen
The blues, blues follow me all day long
The blues, blues follow me all day long
Blues, blues, blues won't you please leave me alone?Embed
