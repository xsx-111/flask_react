Third Degree Lyrics
Got me accused of peeping
I can't see a thing
Got me accused of petting
I can't even raise my hand

Bad luck, bad luck is killing me
Well I just can't stand no more of this third degree

Got me accused of murder
I ain't harmed a man
Got me accused of forgery
I can't even write my name

Bad luck, bad luck is killing me
Well I just can't stand no more of this third degree

Got me accused of taxes
I ain't got a dime
Got me accused of children
Not every one of them was mine
Bad luck, bad luck is killing me
Well I just can't stand no more of this third degree1Embed
