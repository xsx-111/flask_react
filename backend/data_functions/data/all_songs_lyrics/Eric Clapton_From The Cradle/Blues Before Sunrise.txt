Blues Before Sunrise Lyrics
I have the blues before sunrise
Tears standing in my eyes
I have the blues before sunrise
Tears standing in my eyes
It was a miserable feeling, now babe
A feeling I do despise

I have to leave, leave you, baby
Because you know you did me wrong
I have to leave you, baby
Because you know you did me wrong
I am going to pack up and leave you, darling
And break up my happy home

Well, now goodbye, goodbye, baby
I will see you on some rainy day
Well, now goodbye, baby
I will see you on some rainy day
You can go ahead now, little darling
Because I want you to have your wayEmbed
