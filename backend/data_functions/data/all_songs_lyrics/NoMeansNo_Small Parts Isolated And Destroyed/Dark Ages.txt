Dark Ages LyricsWe are living in the, in the dark ages
Haven't seen some daylight in what seems ages
All the information is locked far beyond
Locked in circuits and bathed in silicon
And we're fast asleep with our dreams seething
In and though all is still we are still breathing
But it's him in the dark, he makes me null and void
But it's him in the dark, I think I'm paranoid
A world of half-truths, what goes unspoken
Lines of communication are stripped and broken
And the dark is cold with hands freezing
But this deep-freeze seems strangely pleasing
And the power-trippers receive face-lifts
And the button-pushers all work night shifts
And the misdemeanors seem so ghastly
While the media punch is so lasting
And the Eastern comrades find out much too late
And free men are free to subjugate
Under megashadow, under nine to five
Still it's self-extinction that keeps us alive
We are living in the, in the dark ages
Haven't seen some daylight in what seems ages
All the information is locked far beyond
Locked in circuits and bathed in silicon
I don't know
Go to sleep
We are in the dark agesEmbed
