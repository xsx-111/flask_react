Teresa, Give Me That Knife LyricsCan you picture me standing there?
I see it can you picture me way up there?
I see it now my whole life
I see it now my whole damn life
Teresa, what would you die for? What would you die for?
What would you die for, teresa? What would you die for?
Teresa, give me that knife give me
That knife teresa, give me that knife give me that knife teresa
Can you picture me there?
There I m almost there
I'm almost there I m almost there
Teresa, what would you die for? What would you die for?
What would you die for, teresa? What would you die for?
Teresa, give me that knife teresa, give me that knife teresa
Give me that knife teresa, give me that knife teresaEmbed
