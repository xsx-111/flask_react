Real Love LyricsReal love is scary
You try to hide when it looks for you
You never know what it will do
Not real love
Real love is a long stone bed he said
His face a mask of indifference
And it don't care about
Me or you
Not real love
Real love
On a sunny day is a crow on a telephone pole
With something to say
And you feel like someone has just walked on your grave
That's real love
The glory of love, the glory of love
That precious rain that falls from above
First a gently murmur that calls from the heart
And then a great wind that will blow you apart
That's real love
Like a ghost it will pass through you
A spirit that lives on when you are through
And there is nothing that you can do
There is nothing that you can do
The wind in the trees
The smell of wet leaves
The rumble of a passing truck
A streak of blood
Please forgive me for what I've done to you
And lord forgive me for what I'm going to do
In the name of real love
Is scary you try to hide when it looks for you
You never know what it will do
And it don't care about me or you
And there is nothing that you can do about real love anyway
That's what I heard a crow say
But who cares what a crow say anyway
'Specially 'bout, 'specially 'bout
Something so strictly personal
Can you feel it, can you feel it
Like wind on your face
You can get down on your knees
And pray but nothing
You do or say will make it go away
It's like thunder, lightening
The way you love me it's frighteningEmbed
