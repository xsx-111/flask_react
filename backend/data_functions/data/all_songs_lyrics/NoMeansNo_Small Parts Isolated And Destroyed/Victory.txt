Victory LyricsWhen I set out on this journey I thought it would never end
When I started down that road I could not see the end
And when I took that first step I fell in so deep
And all those things that were so hard-won I thought I would always keep
Now what do you think I see standing like a wall in front of me
Defeat, not victory
Defeat, not victory
Defeat, not victory

So what are you going to do? Die?
No you gonna lay down and die?
No I will not admit defeat I will not admit defeat
I will see victory
Pride and deceit have choked my life like weeds
And I lost sight of what I really had what I really need
And all the things I should've valued
I gave away for a prayer and a song
And now when I reach out for them they are gone
Now you know what I see standing in front of me
Like a headstone a fucking monument to human misery
Defeat, not victory
Defeat, not victory
Defeat, not victory
Do I have any friends here?
I can't see
Are any of my friends here?
I can't see
What about you?
Will you be a friend to me?
What about you?
Can you mean something to me?
I've got a question to ask you and then you can ask it of me
It's a simple request and then you can make it of me
Can you forgive me?
Can you forgive me?
Can you forgive me?
Can you see what will be?
Is it victory?
Now I can't show you all the things I've seen
And I can't make you feel anything
Certainly not what they meant to me
And someday I know, no matter how hard we try
We are all going to have to lay down and die
So maybe I should just tell you what I hope and believe
For every defeat there will be a victory
For every defeat there will be a victory in defeat
