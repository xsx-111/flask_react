Sugar Lyrics
I'm yours
And you are here
Don't you
Really want to feel
That my love is turning on
And it feels so real
So tell me what's the deal yeah
I'm coming back
For more and more
You do it to me
Until I can't take no more
And I know
That all of that real
Good loving is oh so real
And I want all your time
When I'm down here
Sugar, dance for me
Sugar, taste so sweet
Climb on and take the wheel
There's nothing here for you to fear
And my love won't lead you wrong
Let me make this clear
Sweeter and sweeter
I'll always make you feel
I'm coming home
I'm oh so low
I need you baby
Come on let's go
Because only you are my lover
And you're so sincere and fine
So divine
And you're all mine
Sugar caramel
Sugar and it taste so sweet
Sugar my fantasy
Sugar you were made for me
Hey, sugar, my fantasy
Sugar and it taste so sweet
Sugar, my fantasy
Oh, my sugar baby loving is so sweet to me

And it taste so sweet
Sugar, you're my fantasy
Sugar, on and on
Sugar
Say I want your baby
Want you loving
Say I want your babyEmbed
