Lonely Rainbows LyricsTonight, I'm yours
And you are mine
I know a place we can hide
I know a place
Where we can finally see the rainbow
And we can fly fly fly fly fly
I know a place
Over the lonely lonely rainbow
Were we can make things right
I know a place where we can
Always be together
And we can go tonight
I know a place where we can live our lives
And I know a place
Where we can see the light
I know a place
Over the lonely rainbow
Where we can make things right
Over the lonely lonely lonely lonely
