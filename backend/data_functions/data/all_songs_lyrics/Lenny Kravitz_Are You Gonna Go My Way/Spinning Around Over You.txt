Spinning Around Over You Lyrics
Baby, tell me that my love isn't good
I don't treat you right, I don't do it like I should

You try to tell me that my heart isn't true
How would I waste my time doing all I do for you?
You ask me baby, why you hesitate
That you just can't wait but it takes the time it takes

Spinning round and round and round and
Spinning round and round and round and
Spinning round and round over you

You think I dissed you, so you packed your bags
You just kicked me around, you just through me out like trash
Now baby, babe, I'm on my knees for you
Well I might be late but what you're going to do?


Baby, baby, give me half a chance, I could treat you right
I'll give you good times and romance
Because baby, baby, I'm in love with you, you're my superstar
Tu es mon petit chouchou, yeah
