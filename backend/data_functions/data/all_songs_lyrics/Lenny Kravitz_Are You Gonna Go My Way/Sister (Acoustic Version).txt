Sister (Acoustic Version) LyricsSister
Did you have to fall in love
With a man that was up to no good
He took your soul an he stole your only heart
Flipped your wig and left a permanent scar
Sister
Did you have to go away
You left your home
And the things you had to say
It didn't feel good to let you slide
I never got to say goodbye
I miss you girl I think I'm gonna cry
If they knock on your door you already gave
You don't need no more of what's ailing you
Just lean on your soul with all that it takes
May God bring back home to America
America
Sister
It's just a test of faith
Your heart is pure so the devil's in your face
I'll see you soon 'cause thy haven't got a case
You'll be free in a beautiful place
If the knock on your door you already gaveEmbed
