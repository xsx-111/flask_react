Is There Any Love In Your Heart LyricsOoh yeah

Tell me baby, what can't you see
That I'm feeling down
If you open your eyes you'd see
That I'm wearing a frown
You'd think about yourself if you thought I was dead
Aw yeah

Baby, baby you walk around
Like you own this town
You whole life is a fantasy
And I'm playing the clown
You talk behind my back
And spend up all my bread

Is there any love in your heart? Ooh yeah
Is there any love in your heart? Ooh

Babe, you say I'm the only one
But you're fucking all my friends
Baby, all that you care about
Is Gucci and Mercedes Benz
You're just the kind that's up on all the latest trends
Is there any love in your heart? Ooh yeah
Is there any love in your heart? OohEmbed
