Heaven Help Lyrics
There comes a time
To be free of the heart
I want to be ready
Ready to start
On a love journey
Got places to go
Made up my mind
And I have got to let you know

Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
Because I decided right now
I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)
I I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)

A funny feeling's
Coming over me
Now I'm inspired
And open to being
In a love place
But it's out of my hands
I'm telling you baby
That you've got to understand
Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
'cause I decided right now
I'm ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)
Ready for love (Ooh oh oh oh oh)

I can't see what's out there for me
And I know love offers no guarantee
I'll take a chance and I'm
Telling you something babe
I got to let you know (oh)

Heaven help the heart
That lets me inside
Heaven help the one
Who comes in my life
Heaven help the fool
That walks through my door
'cause I decided right now
I'm ready for love (I'm ready for love)
I'm ready for love
Ready for love
Take a chance
Take the chance on love
The heart, the fool
Ah ah ah ahEmbed
