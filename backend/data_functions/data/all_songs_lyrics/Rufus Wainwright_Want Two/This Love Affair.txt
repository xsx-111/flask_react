This Love Affair LyricsI don't know what I'm doin'
I don't know what I'm sayin'
I don't know why I'm watching all these white people dancin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
But I do know that I'm walkin'
Where? I don't know
Just away from this love affair
I can't say that I'm cruisin'
Not that I don't like cruisin'
Just that I'm bruisin' from you
I can't say that I'm waltzin'
Not that I don't like waltzin'
Would rather be waltzin' with you
Ooo oh ooo
So I guess that I'm goin'
I guess that I am walkin'
Where? I don't know
Just away from this love affairEmbed
