Crumb by Crumb LyricsCrumb by crumb in this big black forest
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Maybe in you I'll believe
Maybe I'll believe in you
The future of my understanding of love
Many a time I've before
Before I've many a time
Knocked a stranger's door
Discretion hardly I'm known for
Probably has nothing to
Nothing at all in the world to do with you
Just your lower lip on the floor
Baby I gotta get through
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Maybe in you I'll believe
Maybe I'll believe in you
Suddenly I'm not myself
Behind the facade is a lonely fountain head
Suddenly you are the one
Who opens the gates to this unruly garden
Come and let this man adore you
'Cause baby I gotta get through
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
Maybe in you I'll believe
Maybe I'll believe in you
Suddenly you're not yourself
Behind the facade is a lonely angel's stealth
Suddenly I am the one
Who opens the gates to this now blooming garden
Come and let this man adore
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
You I'll believe
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
You I'll believe
Crumb by crumb in this big black forest
You I'll believe...Embed
