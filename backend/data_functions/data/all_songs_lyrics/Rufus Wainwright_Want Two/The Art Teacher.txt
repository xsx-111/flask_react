The Art Teacher LyricsThere I was in uniform,
Looking at the art teacher
I was just a girl then
Never have I loved since then
He was not that much older than I was
He had taken our class to the Metropolitan Museum
He asked us what our favorite work of art was
But never could I tell him it was him
Oh, I wish I could tell him...
Oh, I wish I could have told him
I looked at the Rubens and Rembrandts,
I liked the John Singer Sargents.
He told me he liked Turner
Never have I turned since then
No, never have I turned to any other man
All this having been said
I married an executive company head
All this having been done
A Turner - I own one
Here I am in this uniformish, pant-suit sort of thing
Thinking of the art teacher
I was just a girl then;
Never have I loved since then
No, never have I loved
Any other man4Embed
