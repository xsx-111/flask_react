Waiting for a Dream LyricsWaiting for the present, for the present to pass
Waiting for a dream to last
You are not my lover and you never will be
'Cause you've never done anything to hurt me
There's a fire in the priory
And it's ruining this cocktail party
Yesterday I heard they cloned a baby
Now can I finally sleep with me?
Diving through the rising, through the rising waves of night
Keeping a reflection of you in hindsight
But in turning back the brackish waters will not reflect you
After you have turned the color black of death or something like that
There's a fire in the priory
And it's ruining this cocktail party
Yesterday I heard the plague is coming
Once again to find me
There's a fire in the priory
And an ogre in the oval office
Once again we all will be so broken
Now can I finally sleep again?Embed
