Memphis Skyline LyricsNever thought of Hades under the Mississippi
But still I've come for to sing for him
So southern furies prepare to walk
For my harp I have strung and I will leave with him
Relax the cogs of rhyme
Over the Memphis sky
Turn back the wheels of time
Under the Memphis skyline
Always hated him for the way he looked in the gaslight of the morning
Then came Hallelujah sounding like mad Ophelia for me in my room living
So kiss me my darling
Stay with me till morning
Turn back and you will stay
Under the Memphis SkylineEmbed
