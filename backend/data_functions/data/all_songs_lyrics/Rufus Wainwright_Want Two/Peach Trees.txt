Peach Trees LyricsIs true love a trip to Chinatown
Or being held in one's opium gaze
Under the peach trees
There I'll sit and wait
Is true love a long walk through Bryant Park
Or bein' held in the month of May
Under the peach trees
Under the peach trees
Under the peach trees
There I will be
Will be until you come and get me
'Cause I'm so tired of waitin' in restaurants
Readin' the critics and comics alone
With a waiter with a face made for currency
Like a coin in ancient Rome
And I really do wish you were here next to me
'Cause I'm going to see James Dean
There I will be
Oh under the peach trees
Under the peach trees
Under
Under
Under the peach trees
With himEmbed
