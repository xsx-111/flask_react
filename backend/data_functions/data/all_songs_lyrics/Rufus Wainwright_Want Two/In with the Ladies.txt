In with the Ladies LyricsGet me new faces, new faces, I'm tired of the old ones
Played aces, lost cases, my place is fine let the bulls run
There's one
Little Lord Bosie cut from the daisy chain
Plain to see little Lord Bosie
And to suppose he's headed for Hades
I know the way
Birds and the bees
No need to say please
Because I'm in with the ladies
First must get Mustang just dust won't go bang with a Grand Am
Dang I've a Mustang aw shucks now you're in with the old gang
Sunset Boulevard, Bosie and Santa Monica
Let's get some silver screen babies
Sunset always seems sweeter
After you've traveled far
Bosie relax you're a winner and I am a star
Who knows the way
Birds and the bees
No need to say please
Because I'm in with the ladies
Please
Now in with the ladies
Now that you're in with the ladies nothin' that you can't do
My how you're in with the ladies drinking from that one's shoe
Man how your Tancho pomade is bewitching the whole swooning crew
And how the macho brigade is now wishin' and wantin' some too
Get me new faces, new faces, I'm tired of the old ones
There's one
Little Lord Bosie cut from the daisy chain
Plain to see little Lord Bosie
Is ringing up rosies and pocketing posies
Bunches of Bradys all spoon fed on Wheaties
No longer Euphrates' Tigris's baby
And oh by the way Bosies heading for Hades
Are heading for Hades
Because I'm in with the ladiesEmbed
