The One You Love LyricsThe mind has so many pictures
Why can't I sleep with my eyes open
The mind has so many memories
Can you remember what it looks like when I cry
I'm Trying, trying to tell you
All that I can in a sweet and velvet tongue
But no words ever could sell you
Sell you on me after all that I have done
I'm only the one you love
Am I only the one you love?
The Lady Gloom and her hornets circling round
Is now before us, the screaming's done without moving
One little move and for sure you will be stung
I'm singing "Oh, Jerusalem oh, Jerusalem
See what he's picked up in the park"
Let's fuck this awful art party
Want you to make love to me and only to me in the dark
I'm only the one you love
Am I only the one you love?
We've traded in our snap shots
We're going through the motions
Into the view, I'm leaving you
Down Conduit Avenue into the early morning
Into the early morning
The one I love
Are you only the one I love?Embed
