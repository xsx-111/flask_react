Little Sister LyricsLittle sister come and sit beside me
Beside me
And we'll play a tune on this old piano forte
Just for a while
Just for a while
Just for a while
Til your hair becomes a powdered wig
And I become a total bastard
Feet that hardly reach the pedal
Sewn to a tremendous shadow
Ave, ave
History is on my side
So complain have no shame
And remember that your brother is a boy
Though it seems the stakes contain some integrity
Me I feel it still is based on good old intrigue
Just for a while
Just for a while
Just for a while
You may have to use your hips as fodder
Still putting your best foot forward
Madame didn't stack the cupboard
Ended up like Mother Hubbard
Ave, but hey
History is still a game
So complain have no shame
And remember that round one has just been played
And you are poised for centuries to claim
Follow examples fond
No longer a choice
The world be just a ball to pass or gaze upon
And one more thing
Before we go 'round again
Let's in this maze
Keep out the thread home again
Oh my little-little sisterEmbed
