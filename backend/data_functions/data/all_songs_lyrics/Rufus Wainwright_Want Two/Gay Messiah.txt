Gay Messiah Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

He will then be reborn
From 1970's porn
Wearing tubesocks with style
And such an innocent smile

Better pray for your sins
Better pray for your sins
'Cause the gay messiah's coming

He will fall from the stars
Studio 54
And appear on the sand
Of Fire Island's shore

Better pray for your sins
Better pray for your sins
'Cause the gay messiah's coming

No it will not be me
Rufus the baptist I be
No I won't be the one
Baptized in cum
What will happen instead
Someone will demand my head
And then I will kneel down
And give it to them looking down
Better pray for your sins
Better pray for your sins
'Cause the gay messiah's coming3Embed
