The Dreamer Lyrics
I'm just a dreamer but I'm hanging on
Though I am nothing big to offer
I watch the birds, how they dive in then gone
It's like nothing in this world's ever still

And I'm just a shadow of your thoughts in me
But sun is setting, shadows growing
A long cast figure will turn into night
It's like nothing in this world ever sleeps

Oh, sometimes the blues is just a passing bird
And why can't that always be?
Tossing aside from your birches crown
Just enough dark to see
How you're the light over me

And by your side, girl, where the acres grow
Into the strong and stunning meadow
A cowboy stumbling in the finest field
And nothing good out there won't be old

Oh, sometimes the blues is just a passing bird
And why can't that always be?
Tossing aside from your birches crown
Just enough dark to see
How you're the light over me
Sometimes the blues is just a passing bird
And why can't that always be?
Tossing aside from your birches crown
Just enough dark to see
How you're the light over me3Embed
