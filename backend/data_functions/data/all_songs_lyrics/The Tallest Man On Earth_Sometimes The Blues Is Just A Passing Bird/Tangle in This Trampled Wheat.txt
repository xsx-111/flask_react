Tangle in This Trampled Wheat Lyrics
Been so many days of longing now
Why should it ever be this far?
Where I get frightened
I could never gather birds enough to carry 'round your heart
But I see traces of your thoughts out here
I see a sight; I hear a sound
I only comfort in the brittleness of days when I can
Hold what I just found

In the untired eyes of the laughing child
And the dirtiest sweater he owns
Early, sun-warmed pine
And all those lifelike sins
That will pull out the memories to show
I'm not leaving alone
I'm not leaving alone

If just that weather-beatin' plane was here
Haven't seen it since I came
Can only wonder if it's near or in the skies
When this damn city sounds the same
And sometimes I'm just a tangle in this trampled wheat
I circle like a losing dog
If just tonight that I could be where you are near
And just forget where I am lost
In the untired eyes of the laughing child
And the dirtiest sweater he owns
Early, sun-warmed pine
And all those lifelike sins
That will pull out the memories to show
I'm not leaving alone
I'm not leaving aloneEmbed
