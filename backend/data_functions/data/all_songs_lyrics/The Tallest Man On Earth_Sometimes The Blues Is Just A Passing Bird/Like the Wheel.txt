Like the Wheel LyricsOh I wish I was the sparrow in your kid's eye
That could fly above this summer all day long
On an island in the heart he has to carry
Past the many you have let into your song
And I said, "Oh my lord, why am I not strong?"
Like the wheel that keeps travelers traveling on
Like the wheel that will take you home
In the forest someone's whispering to a tree now
"This is all I am so please don't fall on me
And it's your brother in the shaft that I'm a-swinging
Please let the kindness of forgetting set me free"
He said, "Oh my lord, why am I not strong?"
Like the wheel that keeps travelers traveling on
Like the wheel that will take you home
And on this Sunday someone's sitting down to wonder
"Where the hell among these mountains will I be?"
There's a cloud behind the cloud to which I'm yelling
Oh, I could hear you sneak around so easily
And I said, "Oh my lord, why am I not strong?"
Like the branch that keeps hangman hanging on
Like the branch that will take me home1Embed
