Message To Love - Live At Woodstock LyricsWell, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I said a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today
Well I am what I am thank you
Some people just don't understand
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool
Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool babe
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come along with me
Don't mess with the man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
You better prove to the man
You're as strong as him
Everybody come alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my messageEmbed
