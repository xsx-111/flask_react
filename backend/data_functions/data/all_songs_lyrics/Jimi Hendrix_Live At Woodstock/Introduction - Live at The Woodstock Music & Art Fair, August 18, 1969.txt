Introduction - Live at The Woodstock Music & Art Fair, August 18, 1969 Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen, The Jimi Hendrix Experience

I see that we meet again, hmmm
Yeah well, well, well
Dig, dig, I'd like to get something straight
We ummm we got tired of the experience, and every once in a while we're blowing our minds too much, so we decided to change everything around
And uh, call it "gypsy sons and rainbows"
For short nothin' but a band of gypsies
We have Billy Cox playin' bass
And um, from Nashville, Tennessee, we have Larry Lee playin' guitar over there
We got Juma playin' congos over there, Juma
And we have our Granny Goose, oh excuse me, Mitch Mitchell on drums
And we got Jerry Velez on congos too
You got yours truly on Pete Whistle
What me worry?

I have mine thank you
I have mine thank you, baby

Will you give us about a minute and a half to tune up, okay?
Like we only had about two rehearsals, so uh, we'll only do another primary rhythm thing, but I mean this is the first  of new risers anyways, somebody  putting the Earth
Which is rhythm
