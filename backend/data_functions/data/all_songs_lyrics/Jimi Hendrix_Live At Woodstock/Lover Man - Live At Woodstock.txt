Lover Man - Live At Woodstock LyricsJimi:
"here he comes"
"here he comes take one"
Here he comes, i say
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
Aah i gotta get my head from this pillow
I gotta get outta your
No heart fellin's
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
Oh yeah
Reach down baby and get my runnin' shoes
I gotta get outta here and i got no time to lose
Hey
Here he comes
Here comes your lover now
Here he comes
Here comes your lover man
I gotta get my suitcase
And get the hell outta just as fast as i can
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Here he comes baby
Doo doo....Embed
