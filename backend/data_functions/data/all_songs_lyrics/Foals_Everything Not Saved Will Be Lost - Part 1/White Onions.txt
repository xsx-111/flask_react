White Onions Lyrics
I see a lair, I see a lair, I see a lair
Whoa
I fight for air, I fight for air, I fight for air
Whoa
I see a lair, I see a lair, I see a lair
Whoa
You keep me there, you keep me there, you keep me there
Whoa

It's getting late now, my head goes ka-boom
No escape from this room and I'll wait for a wave
To come wash away, lead me out of this place
I fight for air, don't keep me there
Don't keep me there, I fight for air

I see a maze, I see a maze, I see a maze
Whoa
I break the cage, I break the cage, I break the cage
Whoa
I'm in a maze, I'm in a maze, I'm in a maze
Whoa
I break the cage, I break the cage, I break the cage
Whoa
I see a lair, I see a lair, I see a lair
Whoa
I fight for air, I fight for air, I fight for air
Whoa
I see a lair, I see a lair, I see a lair
Whoa
I see you there, I see you there, I see you there
