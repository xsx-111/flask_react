On the Luna Lyrics
When I was a latchkey kid on the Luna
A free-from-guilt born Babyboomer
Can't you pick me up a little bit sooner?
I’ve been waiting all day, all day
When I was wasting my days at the Lido
I was picking my teeth with a biro
I was keeping it cool with Cryo
Waiting all day, all day

Agitator, extricator, won't you come evacuator?
Infiltrator, hesitater, won't you come emancipator?

A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of

When I was a Kung-Fu kid on the Luna
I was moonin' at the Bella Luna
Trump clogging up my computer
But I’m watching all day, all day
They say that heaven is other people
But the other side's defo evil
Please don’t let there be a sequel
'Cause I’m watching all day, all day
Agitator, extricator, won't you come evacuator?
Infiltrator, hesitater, won't you come emancipator?

A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of

We had it all, but we didn’t stop to think about it
We had it all, but we didn’t stop to think about it
We had it all, but we didn’t stop to think about it
I’ve had a wild one, I’ve had a wild one

A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of

When I was a Kung-Fu kid on the Luna
I was moonin' at the Bella Luna
Trump clogging up my computer
I'm worried all day, all day5Embed
