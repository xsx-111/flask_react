In Degrees Lyrics
We're caught up in silence
I lose you in degrees
See you through the glass doors

I’ve looked all up and down now
I lose you in degrees
Come back around my way again
See me if you please
I'm tongue tied in silence
My words lost on the breeze
Caught up in your orbit still
Release me if you please

I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don’t leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees

I saw the black rain pouring
A lost love on display
Bit by bit and day by day
I know we've lost our way
And I hear your final footsteps
I've lost you by degrees
Pressed up to the glass door
I couldn't watch you leave
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don’t leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don’t leave me on my knees

Around again
I waste my days
Around again
I waste my time
Oh, I know I've wasted time (Around again)
When I’ve tried to please, yeah (Waste my days)
How did I end up here? (Around again)
Where I've come to be, yeah? (Waste my time)
Oh, I feel I've wasted time (Around again)
When I've tried to please, yeah (Waste my time)
Release me when I waste my time (Around again)
Where I’ve come to be here

Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
Am I wasting my time?
I could not persevere
No point wasting my time
I could not persevere3Embed
