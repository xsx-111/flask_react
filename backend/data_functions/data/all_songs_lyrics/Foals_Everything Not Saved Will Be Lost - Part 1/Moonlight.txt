Moonlight Lyrics
I walked into the desert
I walked out of the past
You were riding on a black horse
To sing songs at the table again
I walked into the desert
I walked into the dawn
You came to me on a black horse
To remind me of all I've said and done

"Be lightweight,"
When I roam
"Be lightweight,"
When I roam
"Be lightweight,"
When I roam
"Be lightweight,"
When I roam1Embed
