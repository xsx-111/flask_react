Sunday Lyrics
Time has come and time is gone
Cities burn, we got youth to spend
And time to waste in love
To live again, my friend
Through the flames and through the fire
Cities burn, we don't give a damn
'Cause we got all our friends right here
We got youth to spend

'Cause time away from me
Is what I need to clear my sight and clear my head
I'm coming down over it, coming down over
Coming down over
I'll be right there, I'm coming down over it
Coming down over again

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

When all is said and all is done
Our fathers run and leave all the damage
They've done behind
Left us with the blind leading the blind
And time has come and time is done
Cities burn, we don't give a damn
'Cause we got all our friends right here
We got youth to spend
Time away from me is what I need
To clear my sight and clear my head
I'm coming down over it, coming down over
Coming down over
I'll be right there, I'm coming down over it
Coming down over again

Be right there, I'll be right there
Down I go, I'll scream, I'll go down again
I feel my blood, I did my time
I'm deep in my head, I'm deep in my way
I'm deep in my soul
Here I go
I'll be right there

I'm over it now, over it now, over it, I'm over it
Over it, over it, over it
Going over it, over and over it
Finally over it, over it, over it
Over and over it, over and over it
I mean over it, over and over it
Over it, over and over it
Over and over it
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
(The birds are all singing)
(The birds are all singing)
(The birds are all singing, "It's end of the world")
Time away from me is what I need
To clear my sight and clear my head, clear my head
Clear my head
Clear my head9Embed
