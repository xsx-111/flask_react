The Most Beautiful Girl Lyrics
She may well have been
The most beautiful girl in the world
Her life snuffed out
Like a bulldozer crushing a pearl

The secret committee
Deep in its lair
Conveniently far
From the cold desert air
Puts a tick in a box
Turns the key in a lock
To loosen the bonds in her hair

Sleep if you can
Wrapped safe in your cloak
The tumbledown twilight
Havana smoke
Caught in your throat
Mistress Liberty's dance
Held you in its trance
Her bosoms were loaded with nectar and lances
"Well, boys," she said
"You have broken the trust
Hold on to that stick if you must."
Take a fresh grip
On the crucible rune
The patchwork of ashes
Sweeps away love like a broom
Madness comes down
Like the crackpot of ages
The raging of angels
Cathedral of stars
Christopher Robin says
"Alice, go home now
They're no longer changing the guard"

"Hold on," she said
"You're breaking my heart."
It's weird how the steel rails
Disappear into the dark
They clung to the ivory tower on her braids
They were never afraid of falling
But the bomb hit the spot where the numbers all stop
And the last thing they heard was her calling...

Home
I'm coming home
I'm the life that you gave
I'm the children you saved
I'm the promise you made
I'm the woman you crave
So hold on...
I'm coming home (Hold on, I'm coming home)2Embed
