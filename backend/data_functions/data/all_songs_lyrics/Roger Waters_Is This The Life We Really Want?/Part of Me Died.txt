Part of Me Died Lyrics
The part that is envious
Cold hearted and devious
Greedy, mischievous
Global, colonial
Bloodthirsty, blind
Mindless and cheap
Focused on borders
And slaughter and sheep
Burning of books
Bulldozing of homes
Given to targeted killing
With drones
Lethal injections
Arrest without trial
Monocular vision
Gangrene and slime
Unction, sarcasm
Common assault
Self-satisfied heroic killers
Lifted on high
Piracy adverts, acid attacks
On women by bullies and perverts and hacks
The rigging of ballots and the buying of power
Lies from the pulpit
Rape in the shower
Mute, indifferent
Feeling no shame
Portly, important
Leering, deranged
Sat in the corner watching TV
Deaf to the cries of children in pain
Dead to the world
Just watching the game
Watching endless repeats -
Out of sight, out of mind
Silence, indifference:
The ultimate crime
But when I met you, that part of me died
Bring me a bowl
To bathe her feet in
Bring me my final cigarette
It would be better by far to die in her arms
Than to linger
In a lifetime of regret1Embed
