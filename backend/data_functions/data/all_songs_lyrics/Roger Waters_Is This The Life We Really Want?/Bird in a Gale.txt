Bird in a Gale Lyrics
"We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Check the number and dial again."
"The time from your telephone company is 9:33."
"Please hang up"
"Severe thunderstorms were located along the line extending from  to ."
"Here is the news:"
"In a few moments, you can hear Big Ben ringing out the old year, and ringing in the new."
"Cashier number one, please."
"Hail damage to vehicles is expected. Expect wind damage to roofs, siding, and trees"
"The time now is five minutes past midnight on the first of January."
"Cromarty, Forth, Tyne, Dogger: southwesterly and westerly, five, seven."
"This is London calling"
"At the third stroke, it will be 8:57, precisely."
"Columbia on West Jefferson and Cambria"
"Fisher: southwesterly very westerly, six to gale eight."
"Cashier number six"
"25, precisely"
"And it's also the end of broadcasting"

Are you blowing (You blowing...)
Like a bird in a gale? (Gale, gale, gale, gale...)
Does the pain of your loss seep into your feathers like rain? (Rain, rain, rain, rain...)
Do the bars of your cage feel warm or cold to the touch? (Touch, touch, touch, touch...)
Were my caresses too gentle, did I love you too much? (Much, much, much, much...)
The dog is scratching at the door
The boy is drowning in the sea
(Sea, sea, sea, sea...)
Can I crash out on your floor?
(Floor, floor, floor, floor...)

Double sin, Poirot
Double sin, Poirot
Double sin, Poirot
The time now is
The time now is
The time now is
A happy new year to you all
A happy new year to you all
A happy new year to you all
A happy new year to you all
A happy new year to you all
On the first of January
On the first of January
Double sin, Poirot

The loon is howling at the sea
(Sea, sea, sea, sea...)
Can I crash out on your floor?
(Floor, floor, floor, floor...)
Is there room in the story for me?
(Me, me, me, me...)
