We Rule the School Lyrics
On a beech tree rudely carved
NC love me
Why did she do it?
Was she scared or was she bored?

On a beech tree rudely carved
NC loved me
Why did she do it?
Was she scared, was she pushed?

Do something pretty while you can
Don't fall asleep
Skating a pirouette on ice is cool
Do something pretty while you can
Don't be a fool
Reading the Gospel to yourself is fine

On a bus stop in the town
"We Rule The School"
Written for anyone to read and to see

On a bus stop in the town
"We Rule The School"
Written for anyone with eyes in their head
Do something pretty while you can
Don't fall asleep
Driving from California to New York

Call me a prophet if you want
It's no secret
You know the world was made for men
You know the world was made for men
You know the world was made for men
