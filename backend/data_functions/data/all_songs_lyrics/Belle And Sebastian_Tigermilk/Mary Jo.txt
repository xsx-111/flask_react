Mary Jo Lyrics
Mary Jo, living alone
Drinking tea, on her own
She wants, I don't know what you want

Mary Jo, living alone
Drinking gin, the telly's on
She wants

The night to follow day and back again
She doesn't want to sleep
Well, who could blame her if she wants
The night to follow day and back again
She doesn't want to sleep
Well, who could blame her if she sleeps
Well, who could blame her if she sleeps
Well, who could blame her if she's sleeping

Mary Jo, back with yourself
For company, keep telling yourself you're young
And it will happen soon

Mary Jo, no one can guess
What you've been through
Now you've got love to burn
It's someone else's turn to go through hell
Now you can see them come from fifty yards
Yeah, you can tell
It's someone else's turn to take a fall
And now you are the one who's strong enough to help them
The one who's strong enough to help them
The one who's strong enough to help them all

Mary Jo, you're looking thin
You're reading a book "The State I Am In"
But oh, it doesn't help at all
Cause what you want is a cigarette
And a thespian with a caravanette in Hull

Your life is never dull in your dreams
A pity that it never seems to work the way you see it
Life is never dull in your head
A sorry tale of action and the men you left for
Women and the men you left for
Intrigue and the men you left for dead

Life is never dull in your dreams
A pity that it never works out, Mary
Life is never dull in your dreams
A sorry tale of action and the men you left for
Women, and the men you left for
Intrigue, and the men you left for dead
The men you left for deadEmbed
