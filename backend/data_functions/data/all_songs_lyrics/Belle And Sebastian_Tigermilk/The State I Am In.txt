The State I Am In Lyrics
I was surprised, I was happy for a day in 1975
I was puzzled by a dream, it stayed with me all day in 1995
My brother had confessed he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sister's wedding day

I got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported
Now she's in love
Oh, I was so touched, I was moved to kick the crutches from my crippled friend
She was not impressed 'cause I cured her on the Sabbath
I went to confess
When she saw the funny side, we introduced my child bride
To whisky and gin, to whisky and gin

The priest in the booth had a photographic memory
For all he had heard
He took all of my sins and he wrote a pocket novel called The State That I Am In
So I gave myself to God
There was a pregnant pause before he said ok
Now I spend my day turning tables round in Marks & Spencer
They don't seem to mind
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in

Oh, love of mine, would you condescend to help me?
'Cause I am stupid and blind
Oh, and desperation is the Devil's work, it is the folly of a boy's empty mind
Oh, and now I'm feeling dangerous, riding on city buses for a hobby is sad
Why don't you lead me to a living
And I promise that I'd entertain my crippled friend
My crippled friend

I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in

I gave myself to sin
And I've been there and back again
Oh, yeah5Embed
