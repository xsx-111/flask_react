Electronic Renaissance Lyrics
Play a game with your electronics
Take a step to the discotheque and people
Go outside where there’s someone watching cars go by
And the city tall with steeples

Hand in hand with the electronic renaissance is the way to go yeah
Hand in hand with the electronic renaissance is the way to go, boy
Hand in hand with the electronic glitterati is the way to go
You're learning, soon you will do the things you wanted
Since you were wearing glitter badges

If you dance for much very longer
You’ll be known as the boy who’s always dancing
If you work for much very longer
You’ll be known as the boy who’s always working

Monochrome in the 1990’s
You go disco and I’ll go my way
Monochrome in the 1990’s
You go disco and I’ll go my way
Monochrome in the 1990’s
You go disco and I’ll go Funkadelic, man
Is the way to go
So drop a pill and then say 'hello'1Embed
