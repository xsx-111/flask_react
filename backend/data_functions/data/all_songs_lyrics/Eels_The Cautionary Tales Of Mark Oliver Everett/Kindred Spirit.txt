Kindred Spirit Lyrics
She has an easygoing way
It doesn't matter what you'd say
I understand just what she means
When she says she doesn't care
She doesn't let it wreck her day

She's a kindred spirit
She doesn't have an act
She's got a real big heart
And I gotta win it back

Hard to say how much it meant
The best days I've ever spent
She understands just what I mean
When I say that I don't care
She knows my true intent

She's a kindred spirit
With no plan of attack
She's got a real big heart
And I gotta win it back
Every day I live in regret and pain
You just don't let that get away

There's a kindness that she hears
She knows we're all so full of fear

She's a kindred spirit
When all fades to black
She's got a real big heart
And I gotta win it backEmbed
