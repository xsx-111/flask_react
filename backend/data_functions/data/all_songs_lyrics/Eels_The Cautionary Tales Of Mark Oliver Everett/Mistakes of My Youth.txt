Mistakes of My Youth Lyrics
In the waning days ahead
I gotta look back down the road
I know that it's not too late
All the stupid things I've said
The people I've hurt and let down
But I hope it's not my fate

To keep defeating my own self
And keep repeating yesterday
I can't keep defeating myself
I can't keep repeating
The mistakes of my youth

In the dark of night, I might
Be able to make myself think
That I'm still a younger man
But when the light of day shines down
There's no way to get around it
I'm not the younger man

I keep defeating my own self
And keep repeating yesterday
I can't keep defeating myself
I can't keep repeating
The mistakes of my youth
The choice is mine for making
A better road ahead
The road that I've been taking
Headed for a dead-end
But it's not too late to turn around

In the final moments
I hope that I know that I tried
To do the best I could

To stop defeating my own self
And stop repeating yesterday
I can't keep defeating myself
I can't keep repeating
The mistakes of my youth2Embed
