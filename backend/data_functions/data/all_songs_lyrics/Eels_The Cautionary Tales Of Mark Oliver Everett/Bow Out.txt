Bow Out Lyrics
A lot of what she said
And much of what she did
I don't doubt that she meant well
While drifting and wounded
But it's a game she plays
A game I'd never win
Those days aren't coming back
To change the state I'm in

In the darkness I forgot that the game was all about
Making up reality, and jealousy, and doubt
I bow out

Everything I am
Or what I used to be
Is not part of the hollow shell
Of the man that you see
All the time unsure
All my days, a waste
Never knowing where I stood
Much less which way I face
In the darkness I forgot that the game was all about
Making up reality, and jealousy, and doubt
I bow outEmbed
