Answers Lyrics
Living lost has been the way
Since the day I came along
Drifting through the dead-eyed days
When every turn is wrong

And I knew it was the darkest road
That I'd never know just how
To travel on to get somewhere
But I thought I'd have some answers by now

Meaning to find meaning
In the most meaningless of times
Believing I believed in something
Beyond equals in time

And I opened up my heart and said
This much I'll allow
All who enter welcome in
And I thought I'd have some answers by now

Living lost is not the way
To go from here on out
Attesting in the dead-eye age
Is not all it's about
And I may not have that far to go
I might make it somehow
The brightest light may shine ahead
But I thought I'd have some answers by nowEmbed
