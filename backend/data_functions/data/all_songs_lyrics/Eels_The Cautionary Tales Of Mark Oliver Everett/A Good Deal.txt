A Good Deal Lyrics
My plan to play it cool
Has not been going well
I have such a hard time
Keeping the anger hidden
I've run it through my head
A dozen times or more
And each time it ends with me
Not acting as I did

A grievous oversight that I cannot erase
You couldn't know where to take it to
And none of it matters now, however I appeal
All of it's gone, I've missed a good deal

You disappointed me
In ways I cannot count
But you were the best thing
To happen to me
And that is no reason to
Forget all that you've done
I couldn't expect you to
Give credence to my plea
A grievous oversight that I cannot erase
You couldn't know where to take it to
And none of it matters now, however I may feel
All of it's gone, I've missed a good deal

An effortless beauty I had not come across
It's a heavy loss
And now it's my cross
To bear forever more
I can be sure

And nothing else matters now, whatever I reveal
All of it's gone, I've missed a good dealEmbed
