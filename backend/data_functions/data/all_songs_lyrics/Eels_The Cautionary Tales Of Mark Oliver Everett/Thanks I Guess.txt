Thanks I Guess Lyrics
In the evening when the sun goes black
I sit alone and I plan my stunning comeback

I got your worse and you got my best
I passed the test
I got a lot from your endless mess
Thanks, I guess

I sleep well knowing everything I earned
My companion, the lesson that I've learnt

I got your worse and you got my best
I passed the test
I got a lot from your endless mess
Thanks, I guess

The yellow sky, the blue around the clouds
To still be standing makes a man feel proud

Ahhh ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh ahhhEmbed
