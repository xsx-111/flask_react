Dead Reckoning Lyrics
Flying through the dark
Dead reckoning
My gages can't be trusted
Can't see a goddamn thing
I know the day is coming
That catches up with me
I told you you're no match
But then who could be?
Thought we were the lonely type
On an island of the lost
But it was only me
Because you got lost

I can't change you
I can't change anyoneEmbed
