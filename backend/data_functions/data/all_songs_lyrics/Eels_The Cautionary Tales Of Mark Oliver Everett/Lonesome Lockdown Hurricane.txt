Lonesome Lockdown Hurricane Lyrics
That wind a-blowin'
It's getting strong
The rain a-fallin'
Been falling too long
The pressure in the clouds has changed
Death rattles our window panes
Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricane

They tried to warn us
I didn't care
Said don't be stupid
Get out of there
And now I know it's much too late
Who will discover the remains?
Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricane

Don't you see it?
We're goddamn fools
We always had to break the rules

That wind a-blowin'
It's getting strong
The rain a-fallin'
Been falling too long
The pressure in the house has changed
Death rattles our window panes
Honey, we're in a lockdown hurricaneEmbed
