Good Morning Bright Eyes Lyrics
Good morning, bright eyes
How did you sleep last night?
Well, I didn't sleep so well

The days are going faster
No time for this disaster
Well, I can't do it anymore
And I'm sure

With a heavy heart I tell you this
And if I don't I'll be remissed
There's nothing worse than living lies

I need to be the leader
We don't  the leader
This flame has stayed for all to see
And I've kneeled

We gave it a shot, now I wouldn't discern
Why don't we just back up and call it a day
There's something out there for us both
The days are going faster
No time for this disaster
Well, I can't do it anymore
And I'm sure

Good morning, bright eyes
How did you sleep last night?
Well, I didn't sleep so wellEmbed
