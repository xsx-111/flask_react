Fresh Feeling Lyrics:
You don't have a clue
What it is like to be next to you
I'm here to tell you
That it is good, that it is true
:
Birds singing a song
Old paint is peeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling
Words can't be that strong
My heart is reeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling
:
Try, try to forget
What's in the past, tomorrow is here
Love, orange sky above
Lighting your way, there's nothing to fear

Birds singing a song
Old paint is peeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling
Words can't be that strong
My heart is reeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling
:
Some people are good
Babe in the hood, so pure and so free
I'd make a safe bet
You're gonna get whatever you need

Birds singing a song
Old paint is peeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling
Words can't be that strong
My heart is reeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling
That fresh feeling
This is that fresh feelingEmbed
