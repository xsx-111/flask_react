Lockdown Hurricane Lyrics
That wind a-blowing
It's getting strong
The rain a-falling
Been falling too long
The pressure in the clouds has changed
Death rattles our window panes
Honey, we're in a
Lockdown Hurricane
They tried to warn us
I didn't care
Said "Don't be stupid
Get out of there."
And now I know it's much too late
Who'll discover the remains?
Honey we're in a
Lockdown Hurricane
Don't you see it?
We're goddamn fools
We always had to break the rules

That wind a-blowing
It's getting strong
The rain a-falling
Been falling too long
The pressure in the clouds has changed
Death rattles our window panes
Honey, we're in a
Lockdown HurricaneEmbed
