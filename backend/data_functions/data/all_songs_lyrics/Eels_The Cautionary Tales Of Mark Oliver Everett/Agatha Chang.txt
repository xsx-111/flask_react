Agatha Chang Lyrics
Agatha was beautiful
Her long black hair and aching eyes
Even when she didn't feel so good she looked alright
She always had a smile
And it was good for a while

I wouldn't answer each time the phone rang
But I should have stayed with Agatha Chang

Agatha, she wasn't mean
She didn't cheat, she never lied
Even if she disagreed with you it wasn't a fight
Made you feel like you're both right
But then I lost sight

I couldn't bear to break up my old gang
But I should have stayed with Agatha Chang

What was so important then?
I haven't a clue
How could I have been so blind and cruel?
Agatha, where did you go?
Do I have the slightest chance
I could make up for everything that I did wrong?
But I know it's just a song
And you're probably long gone

Forgot all about her each night that I sang
But I should have stayed with Agatha ChangEmbed
