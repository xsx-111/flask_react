Parallels Lyrics
Woke up lost
In a world I didn't know
I shook it off and
I'm trying to make a go

Ever get the feeling that the story isn't done?
And you know that you are not the only one?

And I know you're out there somewhere
And I know that you are well
Looking for an answer
But only time can tell
Parallels

All things being equal
I'd rather not forget
The things I've seen
And the people that I've met

But something down inside me makes me think there's something more
And I don't have any proof, but I'm sure
And I know you're out there somewhere
And I know that you are well
Looking for an answer
But only time can tell
Parallels

Woke up lost
In a world I can't escape
What I'll become
Is slowly taking shape

Start again is not the end but altogether new
And I'm never giving up 'till I find you

And I know you're out there somewhere
And I know that you are well
Looking for an answer
But only time can tell
Parallels
