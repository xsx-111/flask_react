Series Of Misunderstandings Lyrics
Like a dying man who you tell
You will be alright that is the sell
When you know full well it isn't true
That's what's happened between me and you

I know how you don't want to see
That bored look on my face but you see
I don't think you know how to change it
Inching towards the end bit by bit

It's worth noting that it could be saved
If not for the recent events
A series of misunderstandings
Set the course for a crash landing

If I could do just one thing
Set the clock back many years ago
I'd teach that motherfucker that raised you
How to treat you rightEmbed
