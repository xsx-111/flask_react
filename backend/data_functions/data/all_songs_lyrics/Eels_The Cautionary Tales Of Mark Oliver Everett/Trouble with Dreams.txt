Trouble with Dreams LyricsThere's nothing that i wanna do
More than get alone and be with you
Trouble with dreams is they don't come true
And when they do they can't catch up to you
You don't need a thing from me
But i need something big from you
'cause you know i've got
An awful lot of big dreams
I'm walking down a lonely road
Clear to me now but i was never told
Trouble with dreams is you never know
When to hold on and when to let go
If you let me down it's alright
At least that leaves something for me
'cause you know i've got
An awful lot of big dreams
This is the life that i must lead now
Crossing fingers and wiping brow
Trouble with dreams is you can't pretend
Something with no beginning has an end
You don't need a thing from me
But i need something big from you
'cause you know i've got an awful lot of big dreamsEmbed
