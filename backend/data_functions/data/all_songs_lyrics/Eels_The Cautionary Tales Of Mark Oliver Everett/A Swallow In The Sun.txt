A Swallow In The Sun Lyrics
My love, let me bring
Everything your heart desires
Everything you'll ever need
When you rise, then you retire

Sweet thing, oh my word
Such a very pretty sight
As a swallow in the sun
As a sparrow in the night

My love, can you not feel it
I don't know how to let you go on
A swallow in the sun
A sparrow in the night
All alone

Dear heart, if I may
You are beauty of the earth
You are broken like a glass
You don't know what you are worth

Sweet thing, oh my word
Such a very pretty sight
As a swallow in the sun
As a sparrow in the nightEmbed
