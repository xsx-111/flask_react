Occasional Rain LyricsThere was rain today
And crystal blue was hidden by a cloudy gray
A sudden shower come to chase the sun away
Occasional rain
Damn the weatherman
He seems to work against me any way he can
And he's been dealing tear-drops since the world began
And occasional pain
And blue you, don't believe I'm talking to you
The light is shining through you- still you will not see
Blue you- think I'm trying to undo you
When I only want to seek the Truth
And speak true
I can't tell you when
But someday soon we'll see the sun re-born again
And there'll be light without as well as light within
And occasional rainEmbed
