Golden Circle LyricsToo beat to meet the man today
Mama, I just want to lay here for a while
The wine turned bitter sweet today
Baby, tell me who's the light behind your smile
And Now the circle wheel has turned
Things for which I've yearned
Just vanish like a dream in air
With all the lessons that I learned
I still got badly burned
Retreated to a vacant stare
Well at the very least I find no conflict there
After you've done all you can
Girl, without your guiding hand
I know that I would have to stand
Outside thе golden circle of your love
And now thе circle wheel has turned
Things for which I've yearned
Just vanish like a dream in air
With all the lessons that I learned
I still got badly burned
Retreated to a vacant stare
'Cause at the very least I find no conflict there
Now, after you've done all you can
Girl, without your guiding hand
I know that I would have to stand
Outside the golden circle of your loveEmbed
