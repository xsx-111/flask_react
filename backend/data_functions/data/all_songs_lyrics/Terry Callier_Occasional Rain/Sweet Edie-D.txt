Sweet Edie-D LyricsRumplestilskin's song is a chorus and half too long
I'm a country son, doing all I can
The big city nights got me hung up on the city lights
While I walk the streets, a guitar in my hands
Sweet Edie-D, you mean the world to me
And I love you, but I'm gonna leave you free
Sweet Edie-da, it don't really matter now
While I'm singing Sweet Edie-D
I fell off Noah's ark, I landed in the people's park
Busted my G-string, I forgot what it was all about
I got hung up in a country tune
Blowin' through them changes like a country moon
Barely holding on, tryin' to let it all hang out
Sweet Edie-D, you mean the world to me
And I love you, but I'm gonna leave you free
Sweet Edie-da, it don't really matter now
While I'm singing Sweet Edie-D
Hеre come indepеndent me
Living kind of independently
It ain't the good life, when you're spendin' time alone
Now love is only an idea, sugar
Baby when you're not here
Then I've got nothin' that I can really call my own
Sweet Edie-D, you mean the world to me
And I love you, but I'm gonna leave you free
Sweet Edie-da, it don't really matter now
While I'm singing Sweet Edie-DEmbed
