Segue #5 - Go Ahead On LyricsI'm gonna go 'head on, I'd better go 'head on
I'm gonna go 'head on, goin' to my lonesome home
I've got to see you when you want me
I got to see you when you can
Honey, you got me believin'
That you done got another man
I better go 'head on, I'm gonna go 'head on
I better go 'head on, goin' to my lonesome homeEmbed
