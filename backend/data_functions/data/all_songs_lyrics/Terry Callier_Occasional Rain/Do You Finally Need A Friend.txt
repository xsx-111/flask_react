Do You Finally Need A Friend LyricsI was so sorry when your luck ran out
And the crowd just passed you by
Well now you’re learning what is all about
Do you still have the will to try?
I could have told you there would be a change
You were just to blind to see
Now after all this time, it seems so strange
That you would finally turn to me
Oh you always been a dreamer
Always searching on your own
How can it be
Do you really see?
It’s no good at all
Well, welcome home, baby
It’s been such a long, long time
The trouble’s gone
Let’s leave our tears behind
Just rest your head
And ease your weary mind
Let’s begin again
Do you finally need a friend?
Do you finally need a friend?
So do you finally need somebody, baby?
Well you know I’ve always been your best friend, baby
Do you finally need a friend?
Do you finally need a friend?
Do you finally need a friend?
But do you finally need somebody, baby?
Don’t you know I’ve always been your best friend, baby?
Do you really need me, do you really need me, baby?
Do you finally need somebody, baby?
Do you finally need a friend?
Do you finally need a friend?
But do you finally need somebody, baby?
Do you really need me, do you really need me, baby?
Do you finally need a friend?
Do you finally need a friend?
Do you finally need a friend?
Do you finally need a friend?
Do you finally need a friend?
