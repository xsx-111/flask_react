Trance on Sedgewick Street LyricsCharlie White is slummin', Billy Blues is hummin'
They're ready for the nightly show
Everybody's runnin', 'cause the sons of drums are comin'
There's trouble on the street below
Despair will kick your gate
In black and white are hatin'
While the money makers' havin' fun
Christ, your color's fadin'
Buddha, where are you waitin'?
Turn your halos on and come
Turn your halos on and run
Leather, tinker, tailor man anyone you meet
A Humpty Dumpty sailor man is in a trance on Sedgewick Street
Sweet Saint Peter, pussy-willow eater
Can you teach me how to pray?
A stone wifе-beater, it shows up on your metеr
Take the devil's time to pay
It's the devil's time to play
Handsome Harry couldn't stay, he cut out with Sexy Sadie
Headin' back for where they've been
Tell me who can save
The lady-her reputation's kinda shady
They say she smokes and drinks with men
(That's ok cause I sneak a smoke myself now and then)
Leather, tinker, tailor man anyone you meet
Here comes a flunky what a failure man
He's is in a trance on Sedgewick Street
In the name of peace
Are you gonna pull that bomb release
Just because they told you so?
Fears and doubts increase your angel lost his lease
And sorrow's got a hold on you
Tomorrow's got a hold on you
My man Eddie's steady wailin'
Next month he'll go sailin'
That rascal seems to float along
I just heard ol' Tom was ailin'
They say his health is failin'
I sure hope nobody done him wrong
Leather, tinker, tailor man anyone you meet
A funky junkie and a jailer man
They're in a trance on Sedgewick StreetEmbed
