Blues for Marcus LyricsYou used to say you loved me baby
But now your light don't shine
I got to leave you in the morning good love
And try to straighten out my mind
Well, I gotta straighten out my mind today
I know it's gonna take some time
Yeah, I got to leave you in the mornin' sweet thing
And try to straighten out my mind
I got my bags and my tickets baby
I'm movin' down the line
Goin' straight on back to Golden Gate
Gonna erase you out of my mind
I'm gonna chase you out of my mind baby
Erase you clean out of my mind
Well, I'm goin' straight on back to Golden Gate
Gonna erase you out of my mind
You used to be my pride and joy
But you're too wild to tame
I passed you on the street last night
And you didn't even know my name (or were you stoned girl)
You didn't know my name baby
You were feelin' no pain
I passed you on the street last night
And you didn't even know my nameEmbed
