The Escape Artist LyricsI could be hawk and dove
Fall in and out of love
I could be true to you
Will you be true to me?
Make it easy for me
Make it up just for me
Make it easy for me
Make it up just for me
I paint lines and shapes
On paper and on face
When there is less of me
People see more of me
I was thinking wishfully
Just how pleasing it would be
To be allowed to pick and choose
To not be frightened by my food
I was thinking wishfully
Just how pleasing it would be
To walk at midnight unafraid
To open my door and be safe
She's in pain she's in fear
???
She's in pain she's in fear
???
My mouth it leaks
See me paint it red
See me make a mess
See how I upset
I was thinking wishfully
Just how pleasing it would be
To be allowed to pick and choose
To not be frightened by my food
I was thinking wishfully
Just how pleasing it would be
To walk at midnight unafraid
To open my door, be quite safe
Around in my head
My thoughts play hide and seek
I tongue-twist easily
If words I cannot see
Round and round in my head
My thoughts play hide and seek
I tongue-twist easily
If words I cannot seeEmbed
