My Cherry Is In Sherry LyricsTime is just slipping by
One dies another cries
My feet not on the ground
Tightrope out of bounds
I'm bandaged and disguised
In a hut I may hide
At one time I could fly
Could not drown so died
Kiss kiss me quick
Upon my lips
I kiss you quick
I bite your lip
Feelings that isolate
Feelings that frighten me
I can see through your smiles
You see through me too
Palette of beetle blood
Runs dark to pale
Beetle blood running
Staining my skinEmbed
