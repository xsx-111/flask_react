Mirror Mirror LyricsI stand in the doorway
I sit on my bed
I look out the window
Wishing that I was dead
Want to lose myself
To the other side
Want to find myself
When I try to hide
Show me how to hypnotize
Show me ways to paint my eyes
The nights are long
When I sleep all day
When I'm back to front
Do I get in the way?
My arms open wide
Will you tumble and fall?
My door is open
If you care to call
Show me how to hypnotize
Show me ways to paint my eyes
The man with his paper
And sugar in his tea
The man by the window
Is staring at me
I disturb the flow
When I look at the stars
We've pulled off our coats
And you know where we are
Show me how to hypnotize
Show me ways to paint my eyes
I don't hear you
Asking questions
You, you say
You don't have the time
You don't have the time
I'm the one that's
Asking questions
I'm the one who
Will not play your game
Will not play your game
I don't hear you
Asking questions
You, you say
You don't have the time
You don't have the time
I'm the one that's
Asking questions
I'm the one who
Will not play your game
Will not play your game1Embed
