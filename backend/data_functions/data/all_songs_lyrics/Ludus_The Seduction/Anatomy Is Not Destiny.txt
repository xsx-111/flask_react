Anatomy Is Not Destiny LyricsI don't pull the wings off butterflies
I don't pull the wings off butterflies
My tongue turns purple when I lie
My tongue turns purple
When I lie
When I lie
When I lie
When I lie
Don't pull the wings off butterflies
I don't pull the wings off butterflies
My tongue turns purple when I lie
My tongue turns purple
When I lie
When I lie
When I lie
When I lie
Still don't have a head behind
Still danger whets my appetite
Still don't have a head behind
Still danger whets my appetite
Anatomy is not destiny
Anatomy is not destiny
So why persist in training me?
So why persist in
Training me?
Training me?
Training me?
Training me?
Anatomy is not destiny
Anatomy is not destiny
So why persist in training me?
So why persist in
Training me?
Training me?
Training me?
Training me?Embed
