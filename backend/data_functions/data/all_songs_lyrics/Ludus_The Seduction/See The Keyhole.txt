See The Keyhole LyricsWould you like to unlock me?
Won't you try to unlock me?
You have your key
Give it to me
Get your key now
Unlock me
See the keyhole
Do you have key?
Would you like to unlock me?
I am silver
I am too smooth
See me glitter
Mirror you
See you gentle
See you angry
See you crying for the moon
I'm by nature solitary
When I squeal
I make a noise
What shall I do?
Buckle my shoe
I don't miss a trick
Do you?
Come stick your head
Well in to me
Push into
My smallest part
I have one mouth
Many voices
Hear me as I change my tuneEmbed
