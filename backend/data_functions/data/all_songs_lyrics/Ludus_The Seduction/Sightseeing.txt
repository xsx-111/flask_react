Sightseeing LyricsWhen I can see through you
What can I see
Can I see me
Does my objectivity
Allow me access to your points of view
Can you see what I see in you
You can see what I see in you
You can see what I see in you
You can see what I see in you
You can see what I see in you
You can't feel what I feel
You can't feel what I feel
You can't feel what I feel
You can't feel what I feel
You can't feel what I feel
You can't feel what I feelEmbed
