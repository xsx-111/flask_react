Inheritance LyricsStrange inheritance
A room of your own
Strange inheritance
A room of your own
See the acrobats strain hard
See the acrobats strain hard
See how they practice
See how they practice
See how they practice
And fall
However we go
However we dress
"no" is no
"yes" is yes
However we go
However we dress
"no" is no
"yes" is yes
Strange inheritance
A room of your own
Strange inheritance
A room of your own
See the acrobats strain hard
See the acrobats strain hard
See how they practice
See how they practice
And fallEmbed
