The Heart Remains a Child Lyrics
I dreamed about you again last night
You never have the same face twice
But I always know it's you and
And you're always looking better than you really do
And you really do

I walk around the whole next day
Feeling like a still have something to say
But I don't know what it is
And I don't know how to reach you even if I did, even if I did

Do I wanna hear that you forgive me?
Do I wanna hear you're no good without me?
And am I big enough to hear that you never even think about me
Why should you ever think about me?

And I thought that I'd outgrow this kind of thing
Tell me, aren't we supposed to mature or something
But I haven't found that yet
Is this as grown up as we'll ever get?
Maybe this is as good as it gets
And years may go by
But I think the heart remains a child
The mind may grow wise, but the heart just sulks, and it whines
And remains a child, I think the heart remains a child
Why don't you love me? Why don't you love me? Why don't you love me?Embed
