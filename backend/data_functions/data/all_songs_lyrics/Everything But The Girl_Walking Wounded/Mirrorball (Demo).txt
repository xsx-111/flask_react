Mirrorball (Demo) LyricsYou never knew the teenage me
And you wouldn't believe the things you didn't see
Some pretty, some ugly
And the lovely mirrorball
Reflected back them all
Every triumph, every fight
Under disco light
Come on girl, it's alright
Come on girl, it's alright now
Come on girl, it's gonna be alright now
Well I guess some boys adored me
But the one I loved ignored me
And caused me in the end to murder my best friend
And though I got her letter, it never did get better
And I got out of my head
Then I joined a band instead
Come on girl, it's alright
Come on girl, it's alright now
Come on girl, it's gonna be alright now
Some good times I remember
My birthday that September
We lay down on the lawn
And counted until dawn
The stars that we lay under
And is he still, I wonder, the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirrorball
Mirrorball
Come on girl, it's too late
Come on girl, it's too late now
Come on girl, let it all go
Come on girl, it's too late now
Come on girl, it's gonna be alright
Come on girl, it's never gonna be alright
It's too late now
Let it all go
'Cause it's never gonna be alrightEmbed
