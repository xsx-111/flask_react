Above the Law Lyrics
This is special, this is new
I'm not fazed by you
And are you new this
Your old hand
I feel above the law
I'm coming into land

Can I get pushy
Can I get too mean to you

Why just be myself
I could be someone else
Someone that you might love more
Why just be myself
I could be someone else
Someone that you might love more

I got serious wants, let me petrify
My so-called adult life
Not on the inside
Was shopping in high street chains
Two years of Saturdays
Just renting videos
Painting takeaways
So If I seem unworried now
It doesn't mean I'm rushing rules

Why just be myself
I could be someone else
Someone that you might love more
Why just be myself
I could be someone else
Someone that you might love more

You don't really need to know my plans
You don't really need to know my plans oh
You don't really need to know my plans
You don't really need to know my plans oh

If you've been here before
If you have who will
Someone who you did love moreEmbed
