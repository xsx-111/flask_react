Big Deal Lyrics
You don't know what's wrong, you only know it isn't right
You don't remember for how long, but you wake in tears at night
Big deal
Big deal

You spend four nights a week now looking for your inner child
What you gonna say when you find him?
Suppose you don't like him or he doesn't like you?
Suppose once you wake him up he won't go back to bed and wants to stay up late watching TV?
But you say there must be some reason why you feel this way

Big deal, that's the way we all feel
Big deal, that's the way I feel
Big deal, that's the way we all feel
Big deal, what is it you wanna feel?

You say you wanna get cured, you wanna turn off your head
Oh and you say it hurts, and you feel unsure
First you doubt yourself and then you doubt her

Big deal, that's the way we all feel
Big deal, what is it you wanna feel?
Big deal, that's the way I feel
Big deal, what she think she feels?
What is it you wanna feel?
I don't think you wanna feelEmbed
