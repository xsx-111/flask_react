Before Today Lyrics
I don't want excuses
I don't want your smiles
I don't want to feel like we're apart a thousand miles
I don't want your attitude
I don't want your things
I don't want a phone that never rings

I want your love, and I want it now
I want your love, and I want it now

I don't want your history
I don't want that stuff
I want you to shut your mouth
That would be enough
I don't care if you've been here before
You don't understand
Tonight, I feel above the law, I'm coming in to land

I want your love, and I want it now
I want your love, and I want it now

My heart is that much harder now
That's what I thought before today
My heart is that much harder now
And I thought that it would stay that way, before today
Before today
I don't want a phone that never rings
I want your love, and I want it now
I want your love, and I want it now
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your love
I want your loveEmbed
