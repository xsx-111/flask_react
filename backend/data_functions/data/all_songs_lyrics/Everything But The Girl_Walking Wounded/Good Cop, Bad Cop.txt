Good Cop, Bad Cop Lyrics
I don't wanna feel this way
I don't wanna feel this way

I don't wanna feel this way
Won't somebody take away this feeling
I'm looking at an open sky
It's like my roof has got no ceiling

It's wrong to feel this way
I know it's wrong, I know it's bad
To only see what isn't there
To want and want and never have
But you know there's more to me now, don't you?
You'll always cover for me, won't you?
Won't you?

And this used to look half full
Now some days it looks half empty
And some days it feels like nothing
It always used to feel like plenty

But it's wrong to feel this way
I know it's wrong, I know it's bad
To only see what isn't there
To want and want and never have
But you know there's more to me now, don't you?
You'll always cover for me, won't you?
Won't you?
Won't you?
But I don't wanna feel this way
Won't somebody take away this feeling?
You play good cop, I play bad cop
Still my roof has got no ceiling
Still my roof has got no ceiling

I don't wanna feel this way
I don't wanna feel this way
I don't wanna feel this way
I don't wanna feel this way1Embed
