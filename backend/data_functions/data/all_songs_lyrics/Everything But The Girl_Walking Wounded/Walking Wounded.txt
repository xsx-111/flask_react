Walking Wounded Lyrics
Out amongst the walking wounded
Every face on every bus
Is you and me and him and her
And nothing can replace the us I knew
Nothing can replace the us I knew

And no, I'm never gonna let you go
No I'm never gonna let you go
And now I know I had a choice
Though you never made it clear to me
I thought you never felt it deeply
Now I'm never gonna let you go
No I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause I could have loved you forever
I could have loved you forever

What do you want from me?
You trying to punish me?
Punish me for loving you
Punish me for giving to you
Punish me for nothing I do
Punish me for nothing
Punish me for nothing, for nothing
Out amongst the walking wounded
Every face on every bus
Is you and me and him and her
And nothing can replace the us I knew
Nothing can replace the us I knew

You know I'm never gonna let you go
Now I'm never gonna let you go
And now I know I had a choice
Though you never made it clear to me
I thought you never felt it deeply


Now I'm never gonna let you go
No I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause I could have loved you forever
I could have loved you forever
Or I could have left you forever
I could have left you forever

What do you want from me?
Are you trying to punish me?
Punish me for loving you
Punish me for giving to you
Punish me for nothing I do
Punish me for nothing
Punish me for nothing, nothing
Out amongst the walking wounded
Every face on every bus
Is you and me and him and her
And nothing can replace the us I knew
Nothing can replace the us I knew
Nothing can replace the us I knew

Out amongst the walking wounded
Every face on every train
Is you and me and him and her
Some days I think I could go insane
Some days I think I could go insaneEmbed
