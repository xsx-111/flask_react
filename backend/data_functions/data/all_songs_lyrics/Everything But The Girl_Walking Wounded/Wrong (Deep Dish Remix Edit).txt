Wrong (Deep Dish Remix Edit) LyricsI wanted everything for a little while
Why shouldn't I?
I wanted to know what it was like
I pushed you too far
And you started laying down the law
'Til I didn't love you anymore
Now you can pull a little bit
There's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally, it's gonna break
Wherever you go, I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go, I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
So there we both were, in that little house
Just hanging out
You didn't know what you were about
You turned to me as you were
Threading daisies on a chain
You said, "It's decision time again"
Now you can pull a little bit
There's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally, it's gonna break
Wherever you go, I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go, I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
The gound's gonnna swallow you
I was wrong
The gound's gonnna swallow you
I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrong
I wanted everything for a little while
Why shouldn't I?
I wanted to know what it was like
Now you can pull a little bit
There's a little give and take
And love will stretch a little bit
But finally, it's gonna break
Wherever you go, I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go, I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go, I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
Wherever you go, I will follow you
'Cause I was wrong
'Cause I was wrong
I was wrong
I was wrongEmbed
