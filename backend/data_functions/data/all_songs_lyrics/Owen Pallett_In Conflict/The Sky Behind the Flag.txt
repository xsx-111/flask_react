The Sky Behind the Flag LyricsThe only girl I ever fell in love with
Taught me how to drink as if it needed to be taught
I’d always give the girl another shot
We danced away the difficult times
A sheet of noise to wash away her grievance
And I left, in the fading light at the end of the season
She said I was the guy behind the counter
Who would offer to give to you comfort
When there was none
I said that I'm the sky behind the flag
Oh, don’t need a miracle
Oh, we need to lose control
We only need to lose control
The drive goes on as our conversation
Turns to something something on the radio
Then to the drone
The engine is our anniversary song
And I think as I look over: lucky you
Lucky me and lucky lucky you
We will be together in our strangeness and safety
Oh, don’t need a miracle
Oh, we need to lose control
Oh, Owen why must you always be
First to wake and first to fight
First to wound and first to fly
Oh, don’t need a miracle
Oh, Owen why must you always be
First to wake and first to fight
First to wound and first to fly
Oh, I gotta lose control
Why can’t I lose control?
First to wake and first to fight
First to wound and first to fly
Oh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
