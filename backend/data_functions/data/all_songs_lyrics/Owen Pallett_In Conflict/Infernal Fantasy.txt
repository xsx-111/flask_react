Infernal Fantasy LyricsAcross the overpass it starts to rain
We leave your father’s house enveloped in flames
Owen where were you to stop the fire?
I know no satisfaction only know desire
My arms are tender from the summer sun
Hallucinating as we try to make each other come
Your silhouette a stuttering of tracers
The rising flame reflects across our faces
The mind is merciful in its ignorance
For if we correlated all its contents
We’d give our bodies over to a fire
That knows no satisfaction only knows desire
Wait for sunlight
Wait for another time
Wait for sunlight
Wait for another life
Sun shine through you
Sun shine over you, over you
Sun shine through you
Sun shine over you, over youEmbed
