The Secret Seven LyricsMoon, it rises to break across the river and a moon-faced boy
Would you write a speaking part for me?
A part that puts me somewhere between the elevated road and the water
It don’t get better, the hunger, even back in his arms
No, the water will get higher as fast as you run
Charity think no evil and charity never faileth
Let me feed you with a song
I’m out on the street with an open case and a mandolin
And with every coin, I am born again
Faith will return to you, my friend
Some days, I feel like the end of mankind and some days, the beginning
Watching kids turn into lovers/believers
It don’t get better, the hunger, even back in his arms
No, the water will get higher the faster you run
Sun, it rises to shine upon the wreckage of our broken bloody union
Does it fill your gaps like it fills in mine?
The sunlight creeping 'cross the line to rest upon the site of our ruin
And if your mother doesn’t answer, then give me a call
