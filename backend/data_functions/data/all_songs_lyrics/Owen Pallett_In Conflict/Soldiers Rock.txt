Soldiers Rock LyricsOut on a bicycle a reflection left behind
The desires of your daughters they will never be defined
Wild pedal wild energized by the stolen vodka and triple-sec
Wheels spurting up the flecks of mud on your blue jeans and your turtleneck
I’m out on a bicycle feeling god is on my side
My mother didn’t believe in discipline or the unconscious mind
Ooh when you finally realize our love is found between the waking and the dreaming
Ooh we fight one another in the afternoon we bathe we bathe each other in the evening
Pick up pickup your tiny arm and put it round put it round the shoulder of your mother
Pick up pickup your tiny arm and put it round put it round the shoulder of your mother
Somewhere between the road and the ever-darkening sky
Ooh the greediness of our hearts will not be satisfied
As it is said by the occupants who rally round the outer steps of parliament
So it is said confidentially by the men and women working in the government
Pick up pick up the bayonet and run it through run it through the stomach of your brother
Pick up pick up the bayonet and run it through run it through the stomach of your brother
Pick up pick up your bloody arm and put it round put it round the shoulder of your lover
Pick up pick up your bloody arm and put it round put it round the shoulder of your loverEmbed
