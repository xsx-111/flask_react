Song For Five & Six LyricsAt five and six
Even as a child you felt the terror of the infinite
Stenciling your diagrams of trilogies and pyramids on the face of the infinite
And sing about a poetess, hyacinth around her feet
That it will never come again is what makes our life so sweet
Do you agree or disagree?
There’s a gap between what a man want and what a man will receive
The sun has set on me
There’s a gap between what a man want and what a man will receive
You saved the game
And Escobar came from the grave
To warn you with a bloody hand to never try to make the band
Said like a blister undersole, the body will heal any hole
The body gradually transform and lose its features one by one
Until it is as beautiful as the wind before the storm
Do you agree or disagree?
There’s a gap between what a man want and what a man will receive
The sun has set on me
There’s a gap between what a man want and what a man will receive
The sticks smash on the flatbed
Boys tour the town victorious in war
The sticks smash on the flatbed
Boys on the ballEmbed
