Chorale LyricsOut from the heavens
One of the Seven
Comes to collect me
While I am sleeping
Holy enemy
Leave me, leave me be
I’d be leaving too much behind me
Unfinished and unripened
He is a creature of song
In his hands is a model of the Kingdom of Heaven
But he comes from another world
A world I could not, could never believe in
Leads me to the ocean
Clasps my hand
Shades me from the sunlight
We lay down in the sand
Oh surrender
I cannot surrender
I can see it but I cannot feel it
I can say it but I won’t believe it
He is a creature of song
In his hands is a model of the Kingdom of Heaven
But he comes from another world
A world I could not, could never believe inEmbed
