The Riverbed LyricsHeart, heart in your mouth, hand on the paper
With the new work that you’ve found
The gift of your depression weighs you down, down, down
And when you wake for the sixth straight day with the tanqueray
You will rise, rise again, and drink again
Hurtle hurtle into the breach
Let your body fall out of reach
On the day that you find your 30s have left you childless
Remember when you meet your coupled friends with unease
The world will forget any good they have done
And the world’ll forget any good you have done
Hurtle hurtle into the breach
Let your body fall out of reach
Out of thought, out of house, out of your mind
Lay your head, lay your heart next to mine
And try to admit that you might have it wrong
Try to admit that you might have it wrong
Thunderhead, oh thunderhead
I will be your riverbedEmbed
