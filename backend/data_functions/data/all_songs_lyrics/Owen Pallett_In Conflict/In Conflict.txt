In Conflict LyricsStrung out on the highway, the car inverted
What are you but a drum and a tube and a wire, black heart?
A fire in the dark?
A fire in the dark?
I have no statement for your benefit, young man
Except this: we all will live again
In the eyes of an actor
And the light on the glass
So let me see that ass
Hey, hey, hey!
Sorceress, valkyrie, you let you let yourself believe
Sorceress, come clean, you let you let yourself believe
That there is nothing to lose
There is nothing to lose, there is nothing to lose
Remember when you told me all about the father-ghost?
He whispers at you when you try to pull
“You’re an imbecile and your limbs carry lumber
Your limbs carry lumber.”
The shadow of violence is the shepherd of sense
The shadow of violence is the shepherd of sense
And when I hit the fence
I had a hand on the wheel and a hand on the dial
Man on trial
Man on trial
Hey, hey, hey!
Sorceress, valkyrie, you let you let yourself believe
Sorceress, come clean, you let you let yourself believe
That there is nothing to lose
There is nothing to lose, there is nothing to loseEmbed
