Beautiful Lyrics
Come on baby
Come on girl
Come on baby
Come on girl
I love you baby
I love you now
I love you baby
I love you now

Look at us, we're beautiful
All the people push and pull
But let's just go out and ride
Talk about the things we try
Look at us, we're beautiful
All the people push and pull but
They'll never get inside
We've got too much to hide

Come on baby
Come on girl
Come on baby
Come on girl
I love you baby
I love you now
I love you baby
I love you now
Look at us, we're beautiful
All the people push and pull
But let's just go out and ride
Talk about the things we try
Look at us, we're beautiful
All the people push and pull but
They'll never get inside
We've got too much to hide
Look at us, we're beautiful
All the people push and pull
But let's just go out and ride
Talk about the things we try
Look at us, we're beautiful
All the people push and pull but
They'll never get inside
We've got too much to hide

Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautiful
Look at us we're beautifulEmbed
