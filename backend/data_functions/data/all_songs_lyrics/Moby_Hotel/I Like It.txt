I Like It Lyrics
Oh
Oh
I liked it
I like it a lot
Oh
I like it a lot
Oh
I like it a lot

I liked it
I liked it a lot
Steep there, sooner or not
Right there (right there), there on the ground (on the ground)

Did I say I liked it?
Yes you did
Did I say I liked it?
Yes you did

Oh
I liked it
I liked it a lot
Oh
I liked it
I liked it a lot
I like everything about you
I like everything we try
I like everything we did then
I liked it so good inside
I liked it
So good inside
I liked it
I liked it
No, I liked it a lot
I liked it
Oh let it go
Take this
You did it a lot
It's better
Better then most

Oh
I like it
I liked it a lot
Oh
I like it
I liked it a lot

Oh
Did I say I liked it?
Did I say that now?
Did I say I loved it?
Yes you did
Did you understand?
Did you get it right now?
Did it make sense?
Did it feel good now?
Did I say I liked it?
I liked it a lot
I liked it
I liked it a lot

Did I say I liked it?
Yes you did
Did I say I liked it?
Yes you did

Did I say I liked it?
I liked it a lot
I liked it
I liked it a lot
Did I say I liked it?
I liked it a lot
I liked it
I liked it a lot1Embed
