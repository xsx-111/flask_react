Dream About Me Lyrics
Babe
Oh, dream about me
Lie on the phone to me
Tell me no truth
If it is bad
There's enough in my life
To make me so sad

Just dream about
Color fills our lives
Just dream about
Someone else tonight

Babe
Oh, dream about me
On the phone
Talking quietly
I want to be yours
Oh, won't you be mine
Against red skies
For all time

So dream about us
When we're old
Just dream about
How I will let go
And..
And...

Babe
Oh, dream about me
Lie on the phone to me
Tell me no truth
If it is bad
There's enough in my life
To make me so sad

Just dream about
Color fills our lives
Just dream about
Someone else tonight
Just dream about
Color fills our song
Just dream about
How I will let go2Embed
