Forever Lyrics
Two simple places we wanted to go
Two simple things you wanted to know
Everything around I could not see
I wish I'd known how much you loved me

Oh
We could feel this way forever
We could feel this way forever

I watched the sun as it touches you while you sleep
You gave me something that I wanted to keep
I see you smile you smile like a little child
And hold you crying when it all goes wild

Oh
We could feel this way forever
We could feel this way forever


Oh
We could feel this way forever
Oh
We could feel this way forever
Oh
We could feel this way forever
Oh
We could feel this way foreverEmbed
