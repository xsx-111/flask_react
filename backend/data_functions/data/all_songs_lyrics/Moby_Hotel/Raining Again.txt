Raining Again Lyrics
Never know but nothing less
Couldn't see that I have guessed
Couldn't see, couldn't stay away
I never even stopped to dream and
That I'd see anything and
The world is coming out so cold

Oh, and it's raining again
Loud on your car like bullets on tin
Oh, and its raining again
Open the door and pulling me in

Nothing here but nothing less
Cold heart is stuck in this
Couldn't say the kindest words we knew
Everything I tried to say but
No one listens anyway
I had to give up all that I knew

Oh, and it's raining again
Loud on your car like bullets on tin
Oh, and its raining again
Open the door and pulling me in
Oh, and it's raining
Raining again
Oh, and it's raining
Raining again

Nothing here but nothing less
Everything we both regret
Couldn't say the kindest words we knew
Cause it was winter time and
We wanted some more time and
We watched the girls try something knew
We didn't even stopped to see that
That it was breaking me and
The world is coming out so cold
What you want you couldn't get, you
Couldn't wait for something less, you
Had to give up everything you knew

Oh, and it's raining again
Loud on your car like bullets on tin
Oh, and its raining again
Open the door and pulling me in
Oh, and it's raining again
Loud on your car like bullets on tin
Oh, and its raining again
Open the door and pulling me in
Sadness like water raining down
Raining down, raining down, raining down
Sadness like water raining down
Raining down, raining down, raining down
Sadness like water raining down
Raining down, raining down, raining down
Sadness like water raining down
Raining down, raining down, raining down
Sadness like water raining down
Raining down, raining down, raining down
Sadness like water raining down
Raining down, raining down, raining down

Oh, and it's raining
Raining again
Oh, and it's raining
Raining again1Embed
