Very Lyrics
Soon we'll be naked
Inside, oh inside
Love you won't be alone
Inside, oh inside

Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside

Pain
It's warm in here
So come inside
So come inside

Now we will make it
Just you, you and me
Soon we'll take it
Just you, you and me

Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside
Pain
Yeahhh
Pain
Yeahhh

Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside
Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come inside

Pain
It's warm in here
So come inside
So come inside

Pain
It's cold out there
So come inside
So come insideEmbed
