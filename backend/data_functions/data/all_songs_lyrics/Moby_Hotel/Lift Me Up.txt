Lift Me Up Lyrics
Plain talking (Plain talking)
Take us so far (Take us so far)
Broken down cars (Broken down cars)
Like strung-out old stars (Like strung-out old stars)
Plain talking (Plain talking)
Served us so well (Served us so well)
Traveled through hell (Traveled through hell)
We know how it felt (We know how it felt)

Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama

Plain talking (Plain talking)
Making us bold (Making us bold)
So strong out and cold (So strong out and cold)
Feeling so old (Feeling so old)
Plain talking (Plain talking)
Has ruined us now (Has ruined us now)
You never know how (You never know how)
Sweeter than thou (Sweeter than thou)
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama

Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la
Lift me up, lift me up
Ohla la la la2Embed
