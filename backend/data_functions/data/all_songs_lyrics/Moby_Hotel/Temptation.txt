Temptation Lyrics
Heaven
A gateway to hope
Just like a feeling
I need, it's no joke

And though it hurts me
To see you this way
Betrayed by words
I'd never heard
Too hard to say them

Oh up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I'll walk alone
Find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I'll walk alone
Find my soul as I go home

Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Each way I turn
I know I'll always try
To break the circle
That has been placed around me

From time to time
I find I lost
Some meaning
That was urgent
To myself
I do believe

Oh up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I'll walk alone
Find my soul as I go home
Up, down, turn around
Please don't let me hit the ground
Tonight I think I'll walk alone
Find my soul as I go home

Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Time
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
And I've never met anyone quite like you before
And I've never met anyone quite like you before

Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last time
Oh it's the last time, it's the last timeEmbed
