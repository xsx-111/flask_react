Love Should Lyrics
So we in sleep in bed
We never make
Holding close to love
Love should fade
Holding on to this is the best thing we'll ever do

Morning sun is sweet and soft on your eyes
Oh my love, you always leave me surprised
I feel my heart starts to burst
With all my love for you
 
I know how it rains
I know how it pours
I never could feel this way
For anyone but you

So it takes some time
And slip away
Holding on to love
Love should stay
Holding on to you is the best thing I'll ever do
Evening sun is sweet and soft in your face
I never ever leave this place
I feel my heart starts to burst
With all my love for you
