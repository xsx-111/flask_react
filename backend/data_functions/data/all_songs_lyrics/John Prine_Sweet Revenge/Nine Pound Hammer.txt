Nine Pound Hammer LyricsThis nine pound hammer
Is a little too heavy
Buddy for my size size size
Buddy for my size
So I'm going on the mountain
Just to see my baby
And I ain't coming back
No, I ain't coming back
So roll on, buddy
Don't you roll so slow
Well, tell me how can I roll roll roll
When the wheels won't go?
Roll on, buddy
Pull your load of coal
Tell me how can I pull
When the wheels won't go?
It's a long way to Harlan
It's a long way to Hazard
Just to get a little brew brew brew
Just to get a little brew
And when I die
You can make my tombstone
Out of number nine coal
Out of number nine coal
So roll on, buddy
Don't you roll so slow
Well, tell me how can I roll roll roll
When the wheels won't go?
Roll on, buddy
Pull your load of coal
Tell me how can I pull
When the wheels won't go?1Embed
