Grandpa Was a Carpenter LyricsGrandpa wore his suit to dinner
Nearly every day
No particular reason
He just dressed that way
Brown necktie and a matching vest
And both his wingtip shoes
He built a closet on our back porch
And put a penny in a burned-out fuse
Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower
'Cause Lincoln won the war
Well, he used to sing me "Blood on the Saddle"
And rock me on his knee
And let me listen to the radio
Before we got TV
Well, he'd drive to church on Sunday
And he'd take me with him too
Stained glass in every window
Hearing aid in every pew
Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower
'Cause Lincoln won the war
Now my grandma was a teacher
Went to school in Bowling Green
Traded in a milking cow
For a Singer sewing machine
Well, he called her husband "Mister"
And she walked real tall in pride
And used to buy me comic books
After Grandpa died
Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower
'Cause Lincoln won the war1Embed
