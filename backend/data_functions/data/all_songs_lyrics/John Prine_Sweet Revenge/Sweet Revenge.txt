Sweet Revenge LyricsI got kicked off Noah's Ark
I turn my cheek to unkind remarks
There was two of everything, but one of me
And when the rains came tumbling down
I held my breath and I stood my ground
And I watched that ship go sailing out to sea
Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail
I caught an aisle seat on a plane
And drove an English teacher half insane
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes and red balloons
So I called up my local DJ
And he didn't have a lot to say
'Cause the radio has learned all of my favorite tunes
Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail
The white meat is on the run
And the dark meat is far too done
And the milkman left me a note yesterday
Get out of this town by noon
You're coming on way too soon
And besides that, we never liked you any way
Take it back, take it back, oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone, the black wind still moans
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge without fail
Sweet revenge, sweet revenge will prevail without failEmbed
