Mexican Home LyricsIt got so hot last night, I swear
You couldn't hardly breathe
Heat lightning burned the sky like alcohol
I sat on the porch without my shoes
And I watched the cars roll by
As the headlights raced to the corner of the kitchen wall
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred coal
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm
All wet and warm
Not ten miles away
Approaching my Mexican home
My God! I cried, it's so hot inside
You could die in the living room
Take the fan from the window, prop the door back with a broom
The cuckoo clock has died of shock
And the windows feel no pain
The air's as still as the throttle on a funeral train
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred coal
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm
All wet and warm
Not ten miles away
Approaching my Mexican home
My father died on the porch outside
On an August afternoon, I sipped bourbon and cried
With a friend by the light of the moon
So it's hurry! hurry! Step right up
It's a matter of life or death
The sun is going down and the moon is just holding its breath
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred coal
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm
All wet and warm
Not ten miles away
Approaching my Mexican homeEmbed
