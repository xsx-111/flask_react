Blue Umbrella LyricsFeelings are strange especially when they come true
And I had a feeling that you'd be leaving soon
So I tried to rearrange all my emotions
But it seems the same, no matter what I do
Blue umbrella, rest upon my shoulder
Hide the pain while the rain makes up my mind
Well, my feet are wet from thinking this thing over
And it's been so long since I felt the warm sunshine
Just give me one good reason
And I promise I won't ask you anymore
Just give me one extra season
So I can figure out the other four
Day time makes me wonder why you left me
Night time makes me wonder what I said
'Next time' are the words I'd like to plan on
But 'last time' was the only thing you said
Blue umbrella, rest upon my shoulder
Hide the pain while the rain makes up my mind
Well, my feet are wet from thinking this thing over
And it's been so long since I felt the warm sunshine
Just give me one good reason
And I promise I won't ask you anymore
Just give me one extra season
So I can figure out the other fourEmbed
