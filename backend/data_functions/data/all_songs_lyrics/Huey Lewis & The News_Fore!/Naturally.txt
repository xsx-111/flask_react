Naturally Lyrics
All the birds have been blue
They don't know what to do
Ever since you said goodbye to me
And the flowers in their gloom, have just refused to bloom
'Cause we all want you back, you see, mmm, naturally


All the birds have been blue
They don't know what to do
Ever since you said goodbye to me
And the flowers in their gloom, have just refused to bloom
'Cause we all want you back, you see
And old mister moon
Is left without a tune
And his shadow's lost the harmony
So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
Everything will work out naturally

You know that love is a struggle
And only the strong survive
So it's up to me and you
To do what we've gotta do
To keep our love alive
And now bees have been gone
And they know that something's wrong
Because they don't feel like buzzing at all
And the stars up in the sky, all they do is cry
And that's why the rain must fall
And the early morning sun
He knows that you're the one
And we both miss your company
So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
Everything will work out naturally

You know life, life is a struggle
And only the strong will survive
So it's up to me and you
To do what we gotta do
To keep our love alive (Keep our love alive)


So don't waste any time
Come back and change your mind
We'll be singing harmonies
With the birds and bees
If only you'll be mine
Things will work out fine
Mmm, Naturally (Ooh)
Whew!Embed
