Forest for the Trees Lyrics
When you're a young man, down and out
You really need someone to help you out
It looks like life or death is your only choice
It's really hard to see
The forest for the trees
The forest for the trees

And when you get angry and everything's black or white
You should know that it isn't that simple, no one's always right
You know that your life it worth living
You gotta start taking if no one else is giving
And if you're not afraid to open your eyes
You may be pleasantly surprised
Things are never as bad as they seem
You just gotta learn to see
The forest for the trees
Forest for the trees
You've gotta learn to see


If you need somebody, tell them please
If you want someone, get up off your knees
You know that your life is worth living
You gotta start taking if no one else is giving
And if you're not afraid to open your eyes
You may be pleasantly surprised
Things are never as bad as they seem
You just gotta learn to see
The forest for the trees
Forest for the trees
You've gotta learn to see
(Forest for the trees)
You've just gotta learn to see
(Forest for the trees)
Gotta learn to see
(Forest for the trees)Embed
