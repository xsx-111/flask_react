I Know What I Like LyricsI like things
That go fast
'Cause I know that good things
Don't ever last
I like believing
In what I want to
Don't like no one
To tell me what to do
And I like
The times that we've had
But I couldn't tell you
What's good or bad
I'm only hoping
That you understand
This feeling that I'm feeling
When I'm holding your hand
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do)
I like the sound
Of breaking glass
And if you don't believe me
Why did you ask?
I like leaving town
And coming back home
I'm going to show ya
When we're all alone
And I like
Staying up all night
Watching old movies
Until the morning light
I don't pretend to know
What's right or wrong
But I won't like leaving
If I stay here too long
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do)
Well, what about you?
I like things
That don't change
'Cause the more something changes
The more it stays the same
I might be simple
Take it easy sometimes
But I can be stubborn
When I've made up my mind
I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like)
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
I know what I like
(I know what I like to do)
I know what I like to do
(I know what I like)
I know
(I know what I like)
(I know what I like)
(I know what I like to do)
(I know what I like)
(I know what I like)
(I know what I like)Embed
