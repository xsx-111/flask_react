Simple as That Lyrics
You go to work, work hard all day
At the end of the week, you collect your pay
That's just where it's at
It's as simple as that
You pay your bills the best that you can
But the rising cost sure hurts a family man
While the rich man gets fat
It's as simple as that
And the money goes so fast it ain't funny
(Hah-hah-hah, it ain't funny)
Your mind's made up to get that house on the hill
But you just don't know if you ever will
Because you can't get the cash
It's as simple as that
Cause the man from the bank, he won't give you a loan
Without putting a mortgage on all that you own
(A tit for a tat)
It's how it is
(It's a simple as that)
Oho, and the money goes so fast it ain't funny
(Hah-hah-hah, it ain't funny)
No! It's as simple
It's as simple
It's as simple as that
Hey!

Before you know it the kids are all grown
And married off with kids of their own
(Now it's all in the past)
True story, yeah
(It's as simple as that)
You've reached the autumn of your life
And all that's left is you and your wife
(And a dog and a cat)
It's how it is
(It's as simple as that)
Ooh, and the money goes so fast it ain't funny
(Hah-hah-hah, it ain't funny)
No, it's as simple
It's as simple
It's as simple as that
Hey-yeah!
It's as simple
It's as simple
It's as simple as that
Even though
Hey-yeah!Embed
