Deep Sunless Sea LyricsDie to forgive
Try not to live
With these eyes anger
Keep me from danger
Be with me here
Without the fear
Without the lies
All loving eyes
Keep me from danger
Please be with me
Deep sunless sea
Nothing to hide
Just rise with the tide
Keep me from danger
Free me from anger
Keep me from danger
Free me from angerEmbed
