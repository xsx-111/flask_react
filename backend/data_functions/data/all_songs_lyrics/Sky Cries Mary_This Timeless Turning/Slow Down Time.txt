Slow Down Time LyricsSlow down time
The soul of the earth escaped into the sky
Don't be afraid to leave your body behind
Slow down time
There's never been a mind
There's never been a time
There mirrors on the wall
These mirrors always lie
The soul of the earth escaped into the sky
Don't be afraid to leave your body behind
Slow down timeEmbed
