Scapegoat LyricsI'll run to the corner
I'll be back by 3:00
Just sleep away the day
And watch some TV
I'll bring you some food
If you'd like some to eat
If you need some money
Then I'll work the streets
I'll be your scapegoat
I'll be there
I'll hold your hand
When scratch and shake
I'll be there the moment
The moment you wake
I'll rob and steal
I'll lie and cheat
I'll lay by your side
I'll pray at your feet
I'll be your scapegoat
I'll be there
Yes it's all my fault
We're all enslaved
No I'm not a saint
And no one is saved
I'll be your scapegoat
I'll be there
When you dieEmbed
