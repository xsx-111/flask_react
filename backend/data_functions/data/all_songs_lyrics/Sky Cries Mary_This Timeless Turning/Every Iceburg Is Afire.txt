Every Iceburg Is Afire LyricsAll the statues are headless
All the homeless are bedless
All the hungry are breadless
All the comies are redless
All the heavens are starless
All the drunkards are barless
Streetwalkers are carless
All the big-talkers
They are cigarless
All the drug stores are drugless
All the persians are rugless
All the worst dress are best list
All the night clubs
They get the guest list
All the oceans are streetless
All the poets are beatless
All the dreamers are feetless
Let all the the diseased be diseaseless
The whole world is moonshine
Everythings a pipe dream
Everyones a shadow
Religions are smoke screens
The whole world's a wino
Oceans getting higher
We're all going swimming
Every iceberg is a fireEmbed
