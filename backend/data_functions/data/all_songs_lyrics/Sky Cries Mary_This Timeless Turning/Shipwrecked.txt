Shipwrecked LyricsThere's no returning
This turning inside
This Timeless Turning
This burning inside
Further than any place
Than any place else
Further than feelings
Feelings I've never felt
White water falls my mind
So much flashes by
Moving fire up your spine
I saw you burning
Death into autumn
I saw you turning
Air into water
I heard you laughing
I heard you crying
I heard you singing
I saw you dying
There's no returning
This turning inside
This timeless turning
This burning insideEmbed
