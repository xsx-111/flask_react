Vuh LyricsLook past the skin
That hides the heart
Past the eye
That hides the tear
Look past the smoke
That hides the fire
Past the dust
That hides the mirror
Look past the skin
That hides the passion
Past the fear that
Hides the pleasure
Look past the ocean
That hides the desert
Past the ghosts that
Hides hells treasuresEmbed
