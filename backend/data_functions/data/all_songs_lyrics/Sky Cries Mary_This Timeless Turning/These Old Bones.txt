These Old Bones LyricsOld stories at the end of the road
New skin stretched across these old bones
Red earth it's the color of heat stoned black
Black stoned feet
A mother sings without moving her lips
Stories told with her hands and her hips
Song of love, of wars lost and won
Of who built the fire in the heart of the sun
Who built the fire in the house of the sun
She saw the earth move to hold up the sky
She saw the sunshine to give the wind it's eyes
Old stories at the end of the road
New skin stretched across these old bonesEmbed
