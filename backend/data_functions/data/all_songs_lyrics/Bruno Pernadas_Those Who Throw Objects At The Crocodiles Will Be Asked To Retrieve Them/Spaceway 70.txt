Spaceway 70 LyricsEverything turns around gold
Since you’ve been homesick
'cause my eyes were blood shot from snow
The night that I met you
Ice-cold dreams make the road safe
I’m floating on the surface
At one point, I thought I could die but nothing ever happened
Silver flash rings going nowhere
Thousand jewels in the water
I get up and walk through the hallway
Haven’t see your face around here
Alligators in a bad mood
Frightening little kids
Peeling off their dreams
On an lousy Sunday
Everyone’s a bit insane
You can’t rely on pain
You cannot miss the game
Across the outer blue space
How could you ever die?
How could you ever be mine?
You go wondering how it should be
In a space town
Sometimes I think I miss Debbie
In a desert I have found you
Alligators in a bad mood
Frightening little kids
Peeling off their dreams
On an lousy Sunday
Eating candy bars, old hats
Kitchen stuff and cash
Doesn’t matter when
Solitude and daydream
Space way seventy
Blue stars in the highway
Splashing down a little rock wall
If we had time
You have been away
Doing crazy things
Catching all the planes
While I sit and wait
I felt I could rest a lifetime
But you see more people than I do
Traveled the world in a spacecraft
Yelling at your mother's boyfriend
Everything turns around gold
Since you’ve been homesick
At one point, I thought I could die
But nothing ever happenedEmbed
