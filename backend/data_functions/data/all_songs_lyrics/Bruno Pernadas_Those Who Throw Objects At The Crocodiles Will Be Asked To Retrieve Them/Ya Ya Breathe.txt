Ya Ya Breathe LyricsSometimes I go
Wondering about
And you know, how bad can it be?
And you know, how bad can it be?
'Cause sometimes I die
Thinking of you and me
But you don't see it
Far as I know
Down
And I don't care if you die tomorrow
And it's your last goal
Never had guessed 'cause you're always so far
And it seems like you're building a time trap
On your own
Sometimes I go
Wondering about
And you know, how bad as can be
And you know, how bad can it be?
'Cause sometimes I die
Thinking of you and me
But you don't see it
Far as I know
Down
And you can go into the sea
And you can go and walk and say
What have I done to myself
|: If you collapse it's all the same:|
Long ago, long ago...
YA YA BREATHE II
What am I doing here, said the young man to the sacred bull
I travelled so far to get here, and yet I still don't know why
I must have done something wrong in the pathway
That's not the face I was hopping to see, that's not it
That's not my loved one Said the young man to the sacred bull
They were singing a song, a lullaby
Long ago, long ago
I don't belong here
This is not my place on earth, he said
Follow the white line, and you shall find the golden path
Said the sacred bull to the young man
Follow the golden path, and you shall find what you're looking for
But that's not the song they 've been searching for
That's not the sound
That's not the loved one
Long ago...
I met a guy
Who talked talks so loud
He thinks he's great
He think's he's hot
And I don't mind
I don't care
I don't mind
I don't care whatever happens
And who knows what could happen
Who cares?
I know a guy
That used to cry
Who used to say things like
You won't die, as long as I'm around
As long as I'm around
You ain't telling me
I met a guy
Who talks so loud
He thinks he's great
He think's he's hot
And I don't mind
I don't care
I don't mind
I don't care whatever happens
And who knows what could happen
Who cares?Embed
