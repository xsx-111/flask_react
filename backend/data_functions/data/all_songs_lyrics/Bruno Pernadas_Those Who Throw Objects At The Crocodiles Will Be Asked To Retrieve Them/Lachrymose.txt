Lachrymose LyricsSometimes I stop and wonder
Will you start a fight?
You drive by and  places
I thought I saw you try
Oh what amassed
Almost a year now
Oh what a star you are
Stop making sense down by the water
It's over my head now
Way over my head now
Way over my head now
Don't even ask me why
I know it all by heart
Western complex is over
We get along just fine
Oh what a beauty drives me to nowhere
Oh what a star you are
Overtime sleeping nothing to say now
It's over my head now
Way over my head now
Way over my hеad now
It's over my head now
Way over my hеad now
Way over my head nowEmbed
