Valley in the Ocean LyricsWill this plan take me down?
No will I sell it to you
Will this plan take me down?
No will I sell it to you
Don't smile or you might stumble

That is no good
Hi, everything's all-
Right

Look on your paycheck
Do you wonder?
Valley in the ocean
Are you laughing?
Look on your paycheck
Do you wonder?
Sun glistens on pretty snow
In a small car
Sun turns it upside down
Smoking under the stars
Notice no one's in the room
Sun glistens on pretty snow
In a small car
Sun turns it upside down

Wade by the water
And everything will be okay Embed
