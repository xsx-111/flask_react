On this old mountain
On this old mountain ooh
On this old mountain ooh
On this old mountain
On this old mountain, ooh

Never trust deja vu
How would you know?
How could you know that I'd be lost without you?
Lost without you
How would you know?
How could you know that I'd be lost without you?
Lost without you
