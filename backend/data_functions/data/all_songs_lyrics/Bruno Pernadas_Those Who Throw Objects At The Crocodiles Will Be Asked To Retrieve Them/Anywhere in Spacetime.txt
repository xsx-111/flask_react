Anywhere in Spacetime LyricsThe queen of hearts, you know that one?
Anywhere in space time
Anyway you found me
Anywhere in space time
I'll be on the moon above you
I think you're not Carol
I think she wants to live in your head
And I don't believe you
Ever since I met you
You say that you want me to stay
And Carol's head is upside down
I tell you "you're mine"
Never will I let you go
I think you're not Carol
I think she wants to live in your head
And I don't believe you
Ever since I met you
You say that you want me to stay
But I don't trust you
Even so
Real time makes no senseEmbed
