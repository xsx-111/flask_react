Calm Before the Storm Lyrics
So we set sail on that day
All our hearts in disarray
That only four could go
Only really goes to show

This heart (this heart) to be broken
This heart (this heart) to be broken
And it's calm before the storm
And it's calm before the storm

Soon we found a rocky cove
Little place to call our own
It was sheltered far away
From the eyes of yesterday


Soon our time was running out
A useless cause, no need to shout
We were waiting for the rain
And you were screaming when it came

It's calm (it's calm) before the storm
It's calm (it's calm) before the storm
It's calm before the storm
It's calm before the stormEmbed
