Sir Queen LyricsOh Sir Queen, here again
What it means to be a friend
So you're working out, and take it everyday
Sir Queen, you're building up my day!
Ahah, you live, you love again
You live, you love again
And now it's time, to make your choice
To where you , raise your voice
So you're working out, and keep it for a find
Sir Queen, you're building up my mind!
Ahah, you live, you love again
You live, you love again
To the end, of the day we go
Wondering what, is left to show
So you're working out, and keep it for a find
Sir Queen, you're building up my mind!
Ahah, you live, you love again
You live, you love againEmbed
