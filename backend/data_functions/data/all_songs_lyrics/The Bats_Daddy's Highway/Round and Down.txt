Round and Down LyricsI must be out of luck
Is what you say to me
I've heard it all before
It's begging by decree
We go round and down
And hug it up the town
We go round and down again
We go up and down
And every other way
We go round and down again!
I must be true to you
Wandering away
These games are wearing thin
I've had enough today
We go round and down
And hug it up the town
We go round and down again
We go up and down
And every other way
We go round and down again!
We've crashed into the night
For the last time I feel
"We knew this had to be,"
I cry into your ears!
We go round and down
And hug it up the town
We go round and down again
We go up and down
And every other way
We go round and down again!Embed
