Mad on You LyricsSome people say
That there's time
When you need them own
I wouldn't know
But I'll tell if this monkey's true
This monkey's true
What can be done
Those people are mad on you
What can be done
It goes so wrong
It goes so wrong
It goes so wrong
There will be days
That admit
To what it was
I didn't take much ??
??
What can be done
Those people are mad on you
What can be done
It goes so wrong
It goes so wrong
It goes so wrong
What can be done
Those people are mad on you
What can be done
It goes so wrong
It goes so wrong
It goes so wrongEmbed
