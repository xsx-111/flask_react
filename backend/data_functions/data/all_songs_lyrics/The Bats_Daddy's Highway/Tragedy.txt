Tragedy LyricsYou should see the letter I got today
It came up from the blue-eyed gray
Tragedy begins at home, or so I'm told
Tragedy begins at home, or so I'm told
I can see your arm is decorated
Showing to me how long you've waited
Tragedy begins at home, or so I'm told
Tragedy begins at home, or so I'm told
Come on and sit close to where I am
See if we can make a smaller land
Tragedy begins at home, or so I'm told
Tragedy begins at home, or so I'm told
Tragedy begins at home, or so I'm told
Tragedy begins at home, or so I'm toldEmbed
