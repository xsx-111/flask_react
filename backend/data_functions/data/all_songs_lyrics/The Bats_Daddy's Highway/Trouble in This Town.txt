Trouble in This Town LyricsLeaving you with someone
Put me on my skill
But you could be so unsure
And lead me to the rail
And there's no trouble in this town
It's the making of your mind
There's no trouble in this town
You might leave me in this place
And make a name for you
And I don't work on history
And that's my only clue
And there's no trouble in this town
It's the making of your mind
There's no trouble in this town
And I've been waiting back at home for much too long
And I couldn't believe what I have song
?? is at the gate
Drive a message home
Until I can no longer stay
And leave you hear alone
And there's no trouble in this town
It's the making of your mind
There's no trouble in this town
And there's no trouble in this town
It's the making of your mind
There's no trouble in this town
And there's no trouble in this town
It's the making of your mind
There's no trouble in this townEmbed
