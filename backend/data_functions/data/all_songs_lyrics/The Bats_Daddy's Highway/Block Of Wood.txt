Block Of Wood Lyrics
Came around, to see what we do
This much I know to be true

And it doesn’t look good
And I’m feeling like a block of wood
So take me away
I know not where

Up and down, in all through the town
Who knew the place, lose their crown

And it doesn’t look good
And I’m feeling like a block of wood
So take me away
I know not whereEmbed
