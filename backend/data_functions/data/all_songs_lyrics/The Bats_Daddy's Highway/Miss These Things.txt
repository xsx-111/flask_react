Miss These Things LyricsSo now it goes
Back to the start
When we would say
We’ll win the parked cars
I miss these things from you
I miss them more each day
I miss these things from you
Why don’t they go?
Through the woods we go
Looking for the dark
We’d never stay too long
Like in the parked cars
I miss these things from you
I miss them more each day
I miss these things from you
Why don’t they go?
And the patterns always change
When you come into view
There’s nothing else like you for me
We beg along
To be here tonight
We won’t be seen
‘Till it feels right, cars
I miss these things from you
I miss them more each day
I miss these things from you
Why don’t they go?Embed
