Candidate LyricsWho is the candidate today?
And can you say it another way?
Who will believe you now?
After all that you've said and done?
We need to know more than you can say
Than it ever was
We need to show more than we know
Now that it's back to you, back to you
Back to you
Now you can tell me
The time that will never be
I want to hear all
Those tales of history
We've got to find our parting is bad
You've been hiding here
You've got to speak before you creep here
And it's back to you, back to you
Back to you
Who can help you now
That you've turned away
From things that you know
Things that you've learned today
You need to go back to a place where
They're in time with you
You're the candidate
You work it out now
That it's back to you, back to you
Back to youEmbed
