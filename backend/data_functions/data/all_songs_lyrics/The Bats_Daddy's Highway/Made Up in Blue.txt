Made Up in Blue LyricsHe's my man and his mind is up in blue
All these friends he'd been talking to
Couldn't waste coming to an end now
Rolling past all this waiting for his time
And I don't know my mind's made up in blue
All those friends you've been talking to
??
Puts his boots on to another day
??
There are times though when you're in control
And I don't know my mind's made up in blue
All those friends you've been talking to
And I don't know my mind's made up in blue
All those friends you've been talking to
??
Even it's been some time before
The old lady has blue eyes still growing
Because I get to know my friend before
And I don't know my mind's made up in blue
All those friends you've been talking to
And I don't know my mind's made up in blue
All those friends you've been talking to2Embed
