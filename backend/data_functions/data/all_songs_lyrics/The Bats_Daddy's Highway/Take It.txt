Take It Lyrics
"You try to take it and you try to make it,"
I say to you
We've never been like this before, I suppose
We must be true
I've been waiting and I've been taking
Time over you
Just shows what a little presence of
Mind can do

And I've been here, waiting in the wings
Like a little lost soul, trying on your things

I've been taking this and that to
Try and ease my mind
There's little that I need to know and little
I need to find
I've been here and I've been there, but now
I'm going back
They say it's just a little spirit that
I tend to lack
