Some Peace Tonight LyricsThere she is, watching away
Hoping for something to show
But she knows it's true till the end
There's nothing coming her way
But just you wait
There'll be morning sky
Bringing you some peace tonight
There will be another change
Bringing you some peace tonight
So, she goes down to the wharf
To see if her man is there
What she knows is true till the end
Her man is not a (?)
But just you wait
There'll be morning sky
Bringing you some peace tonight
There will be another change
Bringing you some peace tonight
But just you wait
There'll be morning sky
Bringing you some peace tonight
There will be another change
Bringing you some peace tonightEmbed
