Had to Be You LyricsSo he wandered down a hole again
With all the doors open wide
There is so much that I can't see
When I'm looking through this still night
Heard about these things before I know
Never thought they would be like this
(?) along the bed by unseen (?)
Keeping us awake through the night
I won't believe in what you say
Until you show what you saw
When it came, again tonight, to me
Then I knew, it had to be youEmbed
