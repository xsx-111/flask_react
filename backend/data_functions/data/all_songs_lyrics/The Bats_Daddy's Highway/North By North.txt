North By North LyricsSome people are happy most of the time
But they don't know they're in line
I don't know what to do with you
I don't know how to deal with you
North by north
I'm still following home
North by north
I know your name
North by north
I'm still wondering why
I find out what you're meaning now
Your term is darkness anyhow
I can't find out what it is with you
If there is one thing I can't get through
North by north
I'm still following home
North by north
I know your name
North by north
I'm still wondering why
Absolve the waiting that you've done
Take away those moments of fun
There won't be much left there for you
I'm taught we've a choice in what we do
North by north
I'm still following home
North by north
I know your name
North by north
I'm still wondering why (why, why)Embed
