Mid City Team Lyrics...2, 3, 4
Oh sister, do you know
What's happened to me?
Oh sister, do you know
(?)
I've been lost in love, since you went away
Oh brother, can you tell
Me about your past?
Oh mother, can you tell
Just how long I'll last?
I've been lost in love, since you went away
Oh father, can you tell
What's happened to me?
Oh father, can you tell
I'm not as happy as can be?
I've been lost in love, since you went away
I've been lost in love, since you went away
Hey, hey, hey!
Since you went away, hey, hey, hey, hey
Since you went away (I've been lost in love, since you went away)
Hey, hey, hey, hey...Embed
