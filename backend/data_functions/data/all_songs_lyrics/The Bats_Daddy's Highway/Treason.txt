Treason LyricsSo we go together like chalk and cheese I know
You may mind my reason go on and tell me now
And I know that we're apart but it won't be for long
And that's why I sing this song and that's why I carry on
So we're out together looking a sight to see
You may call it treason go on and tell me now
And I know that we're apart but it won't be for long
And that's why I sing this song and that's why I carry on
"We'll get along better this way," she said
"We'll get along better this way," she said
"We'll get along better this way."
And the end of the year is looming affecting all the things we do
You may mind my reason marks against my very name
And I know that we're apart but it won't be for long
And that's why I sing this song and that's why I carry on
"We'll get along better this way," she said
"We'll get along better this way," she said
"We'll get along better this way."Embed
