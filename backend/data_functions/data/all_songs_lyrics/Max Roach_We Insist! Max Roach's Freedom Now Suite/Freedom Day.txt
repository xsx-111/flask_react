Freedom Day LyricsWhisper, listen, whisper, listen. Whispers say we're free
Rumors flyin', must be lyin'. Can it really be?
Can't conceive it, can't believe it. But that's what they say
Slave no longer, slave no longer, this is Freedom Day
Freedom Day, it's Freedom Day. Throw those shackle n' chains away
Everybody that I see says it's really true, we're free
Whisper, listen, whisper, listen. Whispers say we're free
Rumors flyin', must be lyin'. Can it really be?
Can't conceive it, don't believe it. But that's what they say
Slave no longer, slave no longer, this is Freedom Day
Freedom Day, it's Freedom Day. Throw those shackle n' chains away
Everybody that I see says it's really true, we're free
Freedom Day, it's Freedom Day. Free to vote and earn my pay
Dim my path and hide the way. But we've made it Freedom DayEmbed
