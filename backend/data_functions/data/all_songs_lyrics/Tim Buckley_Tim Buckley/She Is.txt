She Is LyricsShe is the day that gives me time
To love and linger, love my life
Til night comes on with sundown scythe
To end the pause of pantomime
She is the day of love
She is the bridge on which I wait
To watch the river 'neath me flow
All swimming and surging far below
Along the deep and bending straights
She is the bridge of love
She is the air I breathe entranced
Awake or sleep, in storm or cold
A wind to wash my lifted palm
A sky that calls me out to dance
She is the air of love
She is the day through which I walk
Towards the bridge where she stands
She is the air I breathe to sing
She is the smile without demands
She is the smile that keeps me warm
With matchless laughter, eyes ablaze
No mischief mystery she plays
Upon the flute of early morn'
She is the smile of love
She is the air of love
She is the day of loveEmbed
