Song of the Magician LyricsWhen I sing I can bring everything on the wing
Flying down from dizzy air
To the ground because I care
You will be love and your love will live
When I smile I beguile all the while every mile
As I walk across the sky
Of the clockwork of your eye
You will be love and your love will live
Casting spells from the well I can tell you of bells
Listen to my magic voice
Learn the tunes of children's toys
You will be love and your love will live
When I die do not cry hear my sigh passing by
After I have turned to wind
I will try to help you bend
You will be love and your love will liveEmbed
