Grief in My Soul LyricsI've got ten thousand troubles, a million woes
I got grief in my soul nobody knows
I got heartaches, I got stingin' water fallin' out of the sky
I got a long lost lover, got a reason to die
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes
I got grief in my soul nobody knows
I got sorrow
I'm in a storm that'll spare no travelin' man
I fear tomorrow
Got a love that died long before it began
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes
I got grief in my soul nobody knows
Got a cold chain
I got rain fallin' on my head from above
I got a bad pain
I got a gal don't know the meaning of love
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes
I got grief in my soul nobody knows
I got heartaches, I got stingin' water fallin' out of the sky
I got a long lost lover, got a reason to die
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes
I got grief in my soul nobody knowsEmbed
