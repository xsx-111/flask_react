Wings Lyrics
Although you've spoken many times before
A sight of birth he leaves you by a door
And now you know he doesn't understand
And all you need is the warmth of his hand

And if he'd smile your loving blood would dance
One silent kiss leaves you in a trance
And now you know you cannot live alone
How you know your future is unknown?

One day the questions die
On wings of chance you fly

And on that day your laughs and tears will rise
Fall as free as seabirds climb the skies
And you will love when love comes your way
And when it comes there's nothing more to say
And now you know you don't need his hand
Now, you know you don't have to understand

One day the questions die
On wings of chance you fly1Embed
