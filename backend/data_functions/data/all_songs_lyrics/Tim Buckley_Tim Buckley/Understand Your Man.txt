Understand Your Man LyricsWell let me tell all you pretty women
One tiny word of advice
Tell you pretty woman
One tiny word of advice
Just do me one favor
Won't you understand your man
You gotta wake up in the mornin'
Keep your lovin' daddy by your side
Wake up in the mornin'
Keep your lovin' daddy by your side
Just do me one favor
Won't you please understand your man
Well let me tell you, Miss Molly
Tell you 'bout my lovin' back home
I got a sweet little woman
You know that she'd never make me roam
She's the only woman that I know ever understand her manEmbed
