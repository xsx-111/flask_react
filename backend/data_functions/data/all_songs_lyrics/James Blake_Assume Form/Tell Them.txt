Tell Them Lyrics
You'd like to stay long, though you're a wanderin' soul
And you've got to move on from the squandered soil
When you get what you came here for
Will you leave in the dead of night?
In the hall is a wall of horrors
You're the yonder light

You can't return the sacred time you steal
The fact betrays the way you feel
And the sight delays the right to heal
You decide to stay long

I didn't plan to stay long
I didn't plan to stay long (Stay long)
I didn't plan to stay long
I didn't plan to stay long (Stay long)
In the snake pit so long, I've got posters up (Stay long)
Been defending so long, I don't know how to stop (Long)

Heart, tell them what you came for
Heart, tell them what you came for
Heart, tell them what you've been daydreamin' about
What the evening's about to
You can't return the sacred time you steal
The fact betrays the way you feel
And the sight delays the right to heal
You decide to stay long

I didn't plan to stay long
I didn't plan to stay long (Stay long)
I didn't plan to stay long
I didn't plan to stay long (Stay long)
In the snake pit so long, I've got posters up (Stay long)
I've been defending so long, I don't know how to stop (Long)
I'm so afraid

Tell them what you came for
Heart, tell them what you came for
Heart, tell them what you've been daydreamin' about
What the evening's about to

Ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
Tell them what you came here for
Oh, oh, oh, stay long
Oh, oh, oh, stay long
Oh, oh, oh, stay long
Oh-oh-oh-oh, long8Embed
