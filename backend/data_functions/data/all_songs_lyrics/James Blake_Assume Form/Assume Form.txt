Assume Form Lyrics
Now I'm confiding, know I may have
Gone through the motions my whole life
I hope this is the first day
That I connect motion to feeling
We spin slowly, we spin slowly 'til morning

You know, you know, you know, you know
Appearance is nothing
You know, you know, you know, you know
Appearance is nothing
Now you're my lover, know that
I fell at your ways
Ashamed lover
When you touch me, I wonder what you would want with me

It feels like a thousand pounds of weight holding your body down in a pool of water, barely reaching your chin

I will assume form, I'll leave the ether
I will assume form, I'll be out of my head this time
I will be touchable by her, I will be reachable
I couldn't tell you where my head goes either
But it wanders 'til I'm high up
Where I'm not all here, and there's no karma
When you touch me, I wonder
I always wonder what you could want with me

I will assume form, I'll leave the ether
I will just fall and be beneath her
I will be touchable, I will be reachable
'Cause I can already see that this goes deeper

Now you can feel everything
Doesn't it seem more natural?
Doesn't it see you float?
Doesn't it feel connective?
Doesn't it see you crying?
Don't you know your best side shows when you're unaware?
Not thinking, just primal
Now you can feel everything
Doesn't it get much clearer?
Doesn't it seem connected?
Doesn't it get you started?
Doesn't it make you happier?
Doesn't it feel more natural?
Doesn't it see you float?
Doesn't it seem much warmer
Just knowing the sun will be out?10Embed
