Are You in Love? Lyrics
Are you in love?
Do your best impression for me
I try my hardest for you
Are you in love?
Are you in love?

Are-are we as one?
Everything desperate leaves behind
Don't take away this one defense of mine
I reserve the right to disappear
I reserve a table for old time
Back then, it wouldn't have even crossed my mind
But I promise you, your place is safe
Now what about mine?
Unless you can calm my mind for me
This could easily slide, it could slide for me
This could easily slide, it could slide for me
Into borrowed time, borrowed time
Borrowed time, borrowed time, borrowed time
No idea of how many lied to me
But the memories survive, survive in me
It's all on thin ice, thin ice, thin ice
Your answer will die, will die with me
Are you in love?
Do your best impression for me
I try my hardest for you
Are you in love?
Are you in love?
Are you in love?
Do your best impression for me
I try my hardest for you
Are you in love?
Are you in love?5Embed
