Power On Lyrics
I thought I might be better dead, but I was wrong
I thought everything could fade, but I was wrong
I thought I'd never find my place, but I was wrong
And where I least wanted to look, it came along

I thought sex was at my pace, but I was wrong
I thought it mattered what I'd say, but I was wrong
I thought you were second place to every song
I thought you'd overstayed your welcome
I was wrong, power on, power on

Have you ever coexisted (Power on)
So easily?
Let's go home and talk shit about everyone
Let's go home, finally

Will the waters ever still? That's what I want
And with every inhalation I'm further up
'Til I can only see the outline of the storm
From space I can see that I was wrong
Power on, power on
Power on
Power on
Power on
I thought I'd always have my way to come along
I thought the table'd still be laid, but you were strong (You were strong)
I thought that I could hide my face, but I was wrong
And where I least want you to look, you carry on, carry on

I thought sex was at my pace, but I was wrong
I thought it mattered what I'd say, but I was wrong
I thought you were second place to every song
I thought you'd overstayed your welcome
I was wrong, power on, power on

Have you ever coexisted (Power on)
So easily?
(Power on)
Let's go home and talk shit about everyone
(Power on)
Let's go home, finally

Drop a pin on the mood that you're in
Drop a pin on the mood that you're in
Drop a pin on the mood that you're in
Drop a pin on the mood that you're in
If it feels like a home
Power on, power on
If it feels like a home
Power on, power on, power on
If it feels like a home
Power on, power on, power on
Power, power on
Power on, power on, power on
If it feels like a home
