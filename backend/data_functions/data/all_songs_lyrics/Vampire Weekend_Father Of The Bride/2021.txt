2021 Lyrics
Boy, boy

2021, will you think about me?
I could wait a year, but I shouldn't wait three (Boy)
I don't wanna be (Boy)
2021, will you think about us?
Copper goes green, steel beams go rust (Boy)
It's a matter of (Boy)

Boy, boy
Boy, boy

2021, will you think about me?
I could wait a year, but I couldn't wait three (Boy)
I don't wanna be (Boy)
2021, will you think about us?
Copper goes green, steel beams go rust (Boy)
It's a matter of (Boy)3Embed
