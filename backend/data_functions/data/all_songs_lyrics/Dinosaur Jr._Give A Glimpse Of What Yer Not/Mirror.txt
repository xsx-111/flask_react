Mirror LyricsI've been crawlin' around since I met you
I've been thinking about how to get you
It seems only the time that I left you
I've been crawlin' around since I met you
I've been wondering how not to upset you
To explain and then all that would lead to
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
I've been crawlin' around but there's no trust
It's a shame cause I should get to know us
There's a strumblin' then that's in focus
I don't see no reason
I don't feel the need to try
To wonder why you can
Mix it with the season
I don't want to go and step
When you're so upset again
I've been crawlin' around undetected
It seems only a time for inspection
To explain it now section by section
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
Waste of time
I've been crawlin' around since I met you
I've been thinking about how to get you
It seems only the time that I left youEmbed
