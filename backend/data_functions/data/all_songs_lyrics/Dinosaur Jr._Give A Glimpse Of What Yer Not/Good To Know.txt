Good To Know LyricsBring me over from the shoulder it's a slipping in I should
Ask you what it meant to leave it out believing  the rug
And I'm crawlin' out the window
And I'm crawlin' out the window through the floor
You can help me find the key it is to door
Trouble starts remembering all he had before
Time's a wastin' on the people that seem scared and overrun
Sinkin' deep into the essence of the wasteland mountain come
Not my love
Not my love
Not my love
Not my love
And I'm callin' out to meet you
And I'm callin' out to meet this come through
And I tried to see a way to pull it through
And I know you know the only thing to do
Not my love
Not my love
Not my love
Not my love
Dreams  seems so inbetween  not enough
Tryin' to find what I don't see as a section  makes it tough
Not my love
Not my loveEmbed
