Tiny LyricsComing out I'm deep in doubt
I'll meet you
Calling out it's always with a stare
I can't give you less than what I mean to
I'll pretend that I don't see you babe
I want to know, I want to go
I'm all alone, I want to know
You place a friend, I'm overwhelmed
I need to
Fear is good, you understood it wrong
Box is overflowing and I see you
Feelings is I can't be friends for long
(Chorus)
I know it
I know it for sure
I'll blow it
I know that, it's her
Did I show you a compass of Yer
I'll know it
I'll know it
(Chorus)
Calling out give me something to cling to
Call and take you back and you know where
Call your friends it all depends on me too
Call me back, I'll get on track, I swear
I wan't to know
I wan't to know
I wan't to knowEmbed
