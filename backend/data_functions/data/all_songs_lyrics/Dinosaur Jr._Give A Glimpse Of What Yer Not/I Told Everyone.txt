I Told Everyone LyricsEverybody
Everybody said hello
Every reason
Every myth that's left unknown
Tell the family
Tell them where you thought we'd go
No discussing
Cuz I don't know when it's unknown

To say it's different than before
Left no trace
I showed everyone
I couldn't face
Right on track
I told everyone
Still in tact
Rack my brain
It's a pain
All wrapped up
Inside me
Tell them all
On the fence
On the mend

Every reason
Everyone you could have known
Kept me busy
Everywhere you want to go
Rack my brain
It's a pain all wrapped up
Inside me
Tell them all
On the fence
