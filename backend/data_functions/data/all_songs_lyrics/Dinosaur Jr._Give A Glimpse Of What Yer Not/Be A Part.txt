Be A Part LyricsCome on and be a part of me
Come on and feel if it could be
Brokenhearted
Come on I don't need her to know
When we started
Come on and try and let me go
Come on and be a part of you
Come on and say it isn't true
Brokenhearted
That ain't no way to make it stand
So it started
Come on explain with me again
I don't see a way out
I don't see a reason why
Come on just try and let me see
Come on I need is all I mean
Brokenhearted
I need to feel it breakin' free
Can we start it?
I can't wait till it follow me
I don't know the way out
I don't know the reasoning
The color when it came out
The little things are meant to be
Where's my time
Where we met
Where I find, right in line
The space to shine
Is all a blip
And so am I
Come on and see another through
Come on and tell me if it's you
Come on and let me go again
Come on it's time to tell me when
Brokenhearted
Brokenhearted
Brokenhearted
BrokenheartedEmbed
