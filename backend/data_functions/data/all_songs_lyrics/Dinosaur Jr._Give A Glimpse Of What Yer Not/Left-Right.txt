Left/Right LyricsLeft right I made
A march of mistakes
I held to my word
I held and reversed
Like left faces right
I'll never get inside
My fate is my fate
I'll lie back and wait
I lie and i lied
I lied to believe
And slowly i caved
Let fear claim my faith
Till you broke me down
Spoke to my heart
Then i followed your voice
Got carried away, and

And if you want it, i need it
If you could need what i want...
We left right on time
There's no other time
Then when we all give in
An carried away and ...
And if you want it, i need it
If you could need what i want...Embed
