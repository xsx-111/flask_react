Lost All Day LyricsOh baby what went wrong
You and me, you and me
Oh baby way too long
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
I can't take myself
I can't take a reason
I make it hell
I've been lost all day
I've been gone forever
Should I say?
Oh baby what went wrong
You and me, you and me
Oh baby gone too long
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
I don't know my way
I don't trust the reasons
You escape
I don't take myself
I don't take it easy
Nothing helps
On my block
I gave everything
Wouldn't stop
On my street
I left everyone
On my knee
Oh baby what went wrong
You and me, you and me
Oh baby one more song
You and me, you and me
You and me, you and me
You and meEmbed
