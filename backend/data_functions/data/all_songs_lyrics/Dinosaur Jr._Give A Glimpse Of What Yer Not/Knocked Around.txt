Knocked Around LyricsCan I look a while?
Can I walk a while the 
Will you see me through
Trying but I can't get to you
Picked another love
Picked another troubled time
When explain so long
Gives a glimpse of while the time
And I miss you all the time
And I miss you all the time
I got knocked around
Let me gather what I found
And I'm leaving now
Give a glimpse of what you know
'Cause I miss you all the time
'Cause I miss you all the time
And I miss you all the time
'Cause I miss you all the time
'Cause I miss you
And I'm lonely
And I've fought enough
For my love
And I read through
You won't hold me
Now that's long enough
Caught up
'Cause I miss you
And I'm lonely
And I've fought enough
For my love
And I read through
You won't hold me
Now that's long enough
Caught up
Let's get into
What you showed me
You've done everything
Except our love
I've grown cold here
While you hold me
Yes I've fought enough
In our loveEmbed
