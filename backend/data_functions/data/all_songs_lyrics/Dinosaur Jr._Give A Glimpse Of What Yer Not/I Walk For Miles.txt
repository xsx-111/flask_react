I Walk For Miles LyricsI walk for miles
I came for you
Stop for a while
I came unglued
Left get me tired
What's left to do
Left there so tired
Won't hold of you
In my state
In my loneliness
In the only place I wait
I walk for miles
I came for you
Stop for a while
I came unglued
Left get me tired
What's left to do
Left there so tired
Won't hold of you
In my state
In my loneliness
In the only place I wait
Set my heart is too
Set my beats on you
I walk for miles
I came for you
I walk for miles
I came unglued
Left get me tired
What's left to do
Left there so tired
Won't hold of youEmbed
