Goin Down LyricsI was sure I left her
Pretty sure you said "No way"
I am gonna get her
I can't go more than a day
I can't face myself
Tryin' to pull together
Tryin' to find the little man
Peace and all that I'm in
I make the others disappear
Well this ain't all myself
Are you with me?
Are you with me when I'm gone?
Are you with me?
Are you with me? Come along
Send it all the way
Send it all the way back home
Are you with me?
Are you with me when I'm gone?
Who knows why you're asking
If it pictures in my hand
I can't go without it
And I hoped you'd understand
I can't wreck myself
Are you with me?
Are you with me when I'm gone?
Are you with me?
Are you with me? Come along
I got more to say
I got more to prove you wrong
Are you with me?
Are you with me when I'm gone?1Embed
