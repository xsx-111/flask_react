Love Is... LyricsYou fed it all the time but it had grown so thin
A light the light can't find; the shadow wrapped in skin
Let it fall on you
Let it pin you down
Till you tell the truth
No matter what they say, there's no award for pain
So if you asked for it don't ask for it again

Let it fall on you
Let it pin you down
Till you tell the truth
Careless: what i wished for, what i did
But ruthless, once i had a taste of it
If you lose all it all to gain it
That's a choice that you have made
And the beauty of a life above the law
Love is the law
Love is the law
Here, here comes the age
Where forgiveness is a sin
If you're still
So full of rage
That only poison lets you heal
Now don't forget it
Don't belie
What you saw
Love is the law
Love is the law
Love is the law, I'll follow all it recommends
Let it fall on you
Let it pin you down
Till you tell the truth
Let it fall on you
Let it pin you down
Till you tell the truthEmbed
