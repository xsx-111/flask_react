The Moderately Talented Yet Attractive Young Woman vs. the Exceptionally Talented Yet Not So Attractive Middle Aged Man LyricsYour simple songs, small creations
Always needing validation
Your pouty face, your great photos
Without them, baby, who would notice?
We met once, we were alone
Backstage in Dallas, got your phone number
What a good kisser
I left for Tempe and I missed her
But onstage you aren't strong
I don't recall any songs
But when you sang you hit the notes
I'll give you that, you didn't choke
And you looked so good
Like an actress from Hollywood
And your eyes, they would glisten
But no one listened
And one day you'll be forty
And trust me, babe, it ain't sporty
You'll be pleased to be reviewed
'Cause there's always something new
Someone young, press-friendly
You'll be searching in the alley
Travel hard, 'round the globe
But does anyone know?
The moderately talented old woman
Dreams that she once had
You're a dream, a burning star
The way you sing and play guitar
The way your words cut through
You cast a spell on the room
But your eyes are fog
And in your heart, many scars
Lost friends, ex-lovers
Hidden dads, buried mothers
I could only love you like a friend, dark soldier
Cause I got someone else, and you're older
I didn't mean to go along, but God I love your songs
What a night, what a moment, but don't read it wrong
The moderately talented young woman
The exceptionally talented old man
The moderately talented young woman
The exceptionally talented old man1Embed
