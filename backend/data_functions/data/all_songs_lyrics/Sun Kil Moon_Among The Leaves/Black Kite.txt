Black Kite LyricsFrog goes croak croak
Nicotine stains my throat
On this slow moving boat
I am looking for you
Down the river
Along the sea
Up in the sky a big black kite follows
Stranger with skin pale as the moon
Awoke me in my hotel room
On my mid connection to an unknown world
I'm hoping to find you
Down the mountain
Pear and apple trees
Up in the breeze a big black sheet falling
Empty park so lifeless and quiet
I walk it every day
On my way to china town
To by presents for my love
Black kite
Black kite
Telephone beside my bed
Will it ever ring?
Paper laying at my door
There outside the window
The black kite
Black kite
