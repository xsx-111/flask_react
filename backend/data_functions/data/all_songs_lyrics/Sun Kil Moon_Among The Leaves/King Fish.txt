King Fish LyricsI sit here and wait on the banks of the Carquinez Strait
Watching pelicans swim for a beak of sunning king fish
And I meditate up shore from the golden gate
Watching sea lions bask in sunshine
And find that my eyes can still be awed and surprised
All night I hear wails of the Union Pacific rails
Of ally cat scratch, of lost baby humpbacks
Of incoming ships in from their epic long trips
And of mothers dying, these sounds never leave
Be there for them, spend every moment you can
And love your girl dearly, look deep into her soul
And say that I love you before your body turns cold
I love my girl dearly and also her little dog Boo
We’re a small pack and hey, we’re happy too
I sing her a song, I write her a poem
I gave her my bed and the keys to my home
Whenever we want, we’ll just pick up and go
Out to the forests, to the mountains of El Dorado
Take morning walks, along the rivers that shine
Like old silver dollar, Buffalo Nickels and dimes
One day she may leave if I lie or I cheat
But I hope that she don’t, because I need her so
I tie on my bait on a pier on the Carquinez Strait
With others I cast, sharing some time and some laughs
I come home so proud when my stringer is heavy and full
When the night crickets chirp and they shut down the old arsenal
And my wonderful love, she’ll cook my favorite dish
Dungeness crab and a plate of pan fried kingfish
We’ll fall asleep when our stomachs are full
And in the morning I’ll wish for a bigger catch of king fishEmbed
