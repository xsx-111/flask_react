Lonely Mountain LyricsOh, tiring city, leave you from time to time
People with things in their ears cutting me off in line
Get on the long yellow highway, need to get the hell out
Hassles, hassles, hassles always stacking up
Oh, jilted lover, why won't you leave me be?
Why must you grind your ax against my fruit bearing tree?
Oh, lonely mountain, quiet, peaceful, and green
Out here in isolation, don't hear no ambulance screams
Oh, bitter friend, envious of others' jobs
Envious of others' freedom, gotta work hard to find your sweet spot
Devoted my whole life, nothing came by luck
Your dad paid for your college, my dad gave me five bucks
Oh, endless sessions down here at Ellis and Hyde
My elbows at the desk, I listened and scrutinized
Come home, lay down in bed, drum loop stuck in my head
Tried to shut my brain off and open Night Stalker again
Oh, lonely record, no longer has a home
Only money comes when I get out on the road
Oh, lonely ocean why must I cross
To end up in Puerto Real, Spain, where I'll turn and I'll toss?
Oh, lonely singer lies there awake, looks at the clock
Flipping through a black book, relearning songs that he's forgot
Oh, eager fan follows me show to show
Well, if I have a good night, I might come out and say hello
Oh, patient lover waiting by the phone
I call her from my layover and tell her I'm coming home
Scattered lights of south San Francisco sparkle like diamonds
When the night is black and my airplane's downward gliding
Oh, love I missed you, lie down next to me
Sway with me like the ocean 'til I fall into a deep long sleep
Oh, dandelions coming up from the ground
I reach for a notebook, write down some words and try to wind downEmbed
