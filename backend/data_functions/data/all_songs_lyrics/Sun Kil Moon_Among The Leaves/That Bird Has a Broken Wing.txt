That Bird Has a Broken Wing LyricsFoghorns blowing, all day sirens
Long trip, still unwinding
Had trouble getting out of bed
Basked in the grey of fog instead
Phone rang, sun ain't shining
City I live uphill and trying
Walked 'round the corner, kid said with a zing
That bird has a broken wing
Sister cracked diamonds in two
They laughed, that pigeon flew
Into the street, Market at Hyde
Bus came, that pigeon died
I'm outside, gotta come see you
There's something I gotta tell you
There's a burning in my body
Little Cipro, I'll be well
What kind of man travels and sings
No kids no food to bring
Home in his trunk, home to his stable
Family with a picnic table
Oh melody, why all this
Why you dodging my every kiss?
Okay so I brought home a little sting
From a girl who didn't mean anything
Smoked like a chimney dressed like a witch
Didn't even speak much English
Met her at midnight, took her to my room
She didn't even stay past two
Could've been Belgian, could've been French
Could've been Dutch, I didn't get a chance
To get a number, to get a name
Went to sleep, woke up and got a train
I know you're hating me pretty bad
But I ain't some tool named Brad
Up at seven, home by five
Hasn't got it up since winter time
I really love you more than that
But I'm half man, other half alley cat
I really love you more than that
But I'm half man, half alley cat
Foghorns blowing, cats are hiding
God damn Blue Angels flying
Having trouble falling asleep
Gotta get to the doc this week
Went to his office, told him about the trip
Checked it out, wrote me a slip
Said it seems you're here too often
Next time use a little more caution
Sat me down, had a little chat
Men are men, but we're all half alley cat
Sat me down, had a little chat
Men are men, but we're all half alley catEmbed
