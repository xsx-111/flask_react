Red Poison LyricsWalking down Green on my way Chinatown
Our flight was coming, soon to touch down
Went to pick up some china I'd chosen
The man said to me, "But these are red poison"
I took a step back, "But they're so beautiful
You use them and you'll fall like a mule
So what's the price?" he shot me a scowl
But wrapped them and sold them to me anyhow
The table is set, it's just the right tool
A slow painful death for the unknown fool
For her I await with thick bloody steaks
Served on decadent red china plates
I picked up some more and I keep them around
Keep my ear close to the ground
Waiting for others get rid of them slow
Watch their skin turn, watch their eyes dozeEmbed
