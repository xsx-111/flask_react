Elaine LyricsThe hospital called last night
They said you'd gone code silver
They sent the police out searching
Found you down at Fifth and Minna
High on crack cocaine
You and Juan Valdez
They sent him back to jail
And they put you back to bed
They called in the morning
Said you were found outside and put the phone down
Your cat jumped on my lap
And I laid down and I took a nap
Feeling bad and full of shame
Had I somehow contributed to your pain?
I wish I could help you with your problems
But babe, I got enough of my own
I feel asleep and dreamed of you
The PA said code blue
I hailed a taxi cab
Got there and found you up in West Two
My beautiful sweet Elaine
All that was killing you finally drained
From your sweet angelic face
And I kneeled down and whispered your name

I cried and I cried
You crawled off in a corner and you died
And I kissed my sweet Elaine goodbye
And I walked off in the night
I walked out in the rain
And there you were again
Looking down on my from high
Like a cloud in the sky
I cried and I cried
I remembered all the nights
That I loved my sweet Elaine
That I kissed my sweet Elaine
And then I looked up high
I saw you floating in the sky
And I cried and I cried
Like a baby, I cried
Not much to pick from in my view
Trees that shake when the wind comes through
And boats, I guess, and the water is blue
But I only feel alive when the birds fly
Not much to pick from in my record collection
I sold them all away, don't want no recollection
I put them in the past, don't want to hear the songs
Just want to play guitar and sing my own
The phone rang, I picked up
It was you, you said you were out there waiting
I hailed a taxi, pulled up front
There stood a pretty lady
Smoking a cigarette
Looking eight pounds heavier
I helped you into the back
And put your bags in the trunkEmbed
