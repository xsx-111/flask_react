Weird Science Lyrics
From my heart and from my hand
Why don't people understand
My intentions?
(Weird, ooo!)

Weird science
Plastic tubes and pots and pans
Bits and pieces and
The Magic from my hand will make
Weird science (Ooo!)
Things I've never seen before
Behind bolted doors
Talent and imagination
Weird science
Not what teacher said to do
Makin' dreams come true
Living tissue; warm flesh
Weird science (Ooo!)
Plastic tubes and pots and pans
Bits and pieces and
Bits and pieces

My creation, is it real?
It's my creation, ooo, my creation
It's my creation!
(Weird science)
(Weird)
(Ooo!)

Weird science (Ooo!)
Magic and technology
Voodoo dolls and chants
Electricity, we're makin'
Weird science
Fantasy and microchips
Shootin' from the hip
Something different, we're makin'
Weird science (Ooo!)
Pictures from a magazine
Diagrams and charts
Mending broken hearts and makin'
Weird science
Something like a recipe
Bits and pieces and
Bits and pieces and

My creation, is it real?
It's my creation, I do not know
No hesitation, no heart of gold
Just flesh and blood, I do not know
I do not know!
From my heart and from my hand
Why don't people understand
My intentions?

Oooh, weird science
Magic and technology
Voodoo dolls and chants
Weird science
Things I've never seen before
Behind bolted doors
Weird science
Not what teachers said to do
Bits and pieces and
Bits and pieces and

My creation, is it real?
It's my creation, I do not know
No hesitation, no heart of gold
Just flesh and blood, I do not know
It's my creation
It's my creation (Ooo!)
My creation (Oooo!)
My creation, It's my creation!
From my heart and from my hand
Why don't people understand
My intentions?
(Oooo, weird!)

Ooooo, weird science (Ooo!)
(Weird!)
Weird science
Weird science (Ooo!)
Ooh whoa whoa whoa
(Bits and pieces, bits and pieces bits and pieces)
Ooooh, weird science
(She's alive!)
(Bits and pieces and)
Weird
Ooh whoa whoa whoa
Ooooh, weird science
Science
(Bits and pieces and bits and pieces and)
(Bits and) Science
Weird
Weird science
(Bits and pieces)

My creation, is it real?
It's my creation, I do not know
(Ooo!) My creation, is it real?
Just flesh and blood, just flesh and blood
Just flesh and blood!
