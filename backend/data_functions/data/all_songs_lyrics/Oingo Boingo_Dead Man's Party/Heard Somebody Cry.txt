Heard Somebody Cry Lyrics
I thought I heard somebody cry
I thought I heard somebody

I went to see what I could find
Like flowers in the dead of night
Like shadows in the moonlight
I thought I heard somebody cry
A choir with a single voice
A picnic on a cliff
Antenna like an insect
To pick up all your thoughts

It isn't true
I am not the ghost
Without a soul
Come
Listen to my heart
You feel the beat
Stop
Listen to the sound
Of moving feet
Walk
Through the halls at night
When I'm asleep
(I don't believe) I don't believe
(I don't believe) I don't believe
The shoe is on the other foot
The glove is on the fist
The fist is like a cannonball
But it feels like a kiss
I got a bed that's real soft
In a room that's always sad
I thought I heard a window sigh
I thought I heard somebody cry

It isn't true
I am not the ghost
Without a soul
Come
Listen to my heart
You feel the beat
Stop
Listen to the sound
Of moving feet
Walk
Through the halls at night
When I'm asleep
(I don't believe) I don't believe
(I don't believe) I don't believe
It isn't true
Listen to my heart
You feel the beat
Stop
Listen to the sound
Of moving feet
I don't believe
(I don't believe) I don't believe

A choir with a single voice
A picnic on a cliff
Antenna like an insect
To pick up all your thoughts
I sip the running water
Like rivers from your eyes
I thought I heard somebody cry
Somebody might be lost
I thought I heard somebody cry
I thought I'd go and see
I thought I heard somebody cry
Somebody might be me4Embed
