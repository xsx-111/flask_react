No One Lives Forever Lyrics
You worry too much
You make yourself sad
You can't change fate
But don't feel so bad
Enjoy it while you can
It's just like the weather
So quit complaining, brother
No one lives forever!

Let's have a party
There's a full moon in the sky
It's the hour of the wolf
And I don't want to die
I'm so happy
Dancin' while the grim reaper
Cuts, cuts, cuts
But he can't get me
I'm as clever as can be
And I'm very quick, but don't forget
We've only got so many tricks
No one lives forever!

You think you got it rough? (Rough)
What about your darling doggy?
Ten short years
He's getting old and groggy
I don't think it's very fair
Cold, chop, low
But it's all relative, my friend
No one lives forever!
Let's have a party
There's a full moon in the sky
It's the hour of the wolf
And I don't want to die
I'm so happy
Dancin' while the grim reaper
Cuts, cuts, cuts
But he can't get me
I'm as clever as can be
And I'm very quick, but don't forget
We've only got so many tricks
No one lives forever!

Hey!
Oh (Oh)

You worry too much
You make yourself sad (sad)
You can't change fate
But don't feel so bad
Enjoy it while you can
It's just like the weather
So quit complaining, brother (brother)
No one lives forever!
Let's have a party
There's a full moon in the sky
It's the hour of the wolf
And I don't wanna die

No one beats him at his game
For very long, but just the same
Who cares there's no place safe to hide?
Nowhere to run, no time to cry
So celebrate while you still can
'Cause any second, it may end
And when it's all been said and done
Better that you had some fun
Instead of hiding in your shell
Why make your life a living hell?
So drink a toast and down the cup
And drink to bones that turn to dust, 'cause
No one, no one, no one, no one
No one, no one, no one, no one
No one, no one, no one, no one
No one lives forever!
Hey!1Embed
