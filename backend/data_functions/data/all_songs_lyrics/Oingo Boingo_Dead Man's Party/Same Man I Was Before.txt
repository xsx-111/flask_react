Same Man I Was Before LyricsI'm not the same man I was before
I haven't changed my perception
I haven't lost my protection
I haven't lost, haven't lost, haven't lost
What I have, lost intentions
Two by two, coming in through the door
(Singing like a bird)
Boys and girls, voices joined in song
(Voices in the air)
Firecrackers making so much noise
(Flying in the air)
They all start yelling at me:
"Everything you do is wrong"
I'm not the same boy I was before
But I haven't changed my desires
I've not extinguished the fires
I haven't lost wide-eyed wonder
I haven't lost, haven't lost, haven't lost
That stupid fear of thunder
Two by two walking hand in hand
(Walkin' in the air)
The bones come marching from the Promised Land
(Comes from everywhere)
Their voices carry like the sound of glass
(Breaking on the ground)
It burns my ears when they sing:
"Everything you do is wrong"
Everything you do is wrong
I'm not the same ghost I was before
But I converse with the spirits
When people talk, I don't hear it
I walk through doors when no one sees me
I disappear, disappear, disappear
Whenever it may please me
Two by two, walking hand in hand
(Walkin' through the air)
The bones come marching from the Promised Land
(Comes from everywhere)
Their voices carry like the sound of glass
(Breaking on the ground)
It burns my ears when they sing
"Everything you do is wrong"
Everything
"Everything you do is wrong" (Same man, ooh)
I'm not the same man I was before
(Same illusion)Embed
