Help Me LyricsWhen you spend your whole life
Building stone castles
When the walls start to crumble...
Exposed to the world
When the wind burns my face...
And the smoke burns my eyes
I can't ever cry...
I can't ever cry
You gotta help...
To make me somebody
You gotta help...
To open my eyes
The temperature's rising
How a cool drink would help
I've been thirsty for years...
I've been thirsty for years
I'm hungry for something...
Just the touch of your flesh
To soothe and refresh...
To soothe and refresh
You gotta help...
To make me somebody
You gotta help...
To open my eyes1Embed
