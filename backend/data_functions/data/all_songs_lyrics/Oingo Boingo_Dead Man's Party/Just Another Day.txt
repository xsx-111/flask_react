Just Another Day Lyrics
There's life underground

I feel it all around, I feel it in my bones
My life is on the line when I'm away from home
When I step out the door, the jungle is alive
I do not trust my ears, I don't believe my eyes
I will not fall in love—I cannot risk the bet
'Cause hearts are fragile toys—so easy to forget

It's just another day, there's murder in the air
It drags me when I walk, I smell it everywhere
It's just another day where people cling to light
To drive away the fear that comes with every night

(It's just another...) it's just another day
(It's just another day) it's just another day
(It's just another...) it's just another day
(It's just another day) it's just another day
It's just another day when people wake from dreams
The voices in their ears that will not go away

I had a dream last night: the world was set on fire
And everywhere I ran, there wasn't any water
The temperature increased, the sky was crimson red
The clouds turned into smoke and everyone was dead
But there's a smile on my face
For everyone
There's a golden coin
That reflects the sun
There's a lonely place
That's always cold
There's a place in the stars
For when you get old

There's razors in my bed that come out late at night
They always disappear before the morning light
I'm dreaming again of life underground
It doesn't ever move, it doesn't make a sound
And just when I think that things are in their place
The heavens are secure—the whole thing explodes in my face

(It's just another...) it's just another day
(It's just another day) it's just another day
(It's just another...) it's just another day
(It's just another day) it's just another day
There's a smile on my face (it's just another day)
For everyone (it's just another day)
There's a golden coin (it's just another day)
That reflects the sun (it's just another day)
There's a lonely place (it's just another day)
That's always cold (it's just another day)
There's a place in the stars (it's just another day)
For when you get old (it's just another day)
(It's just another day, it's just another day)
(It's just another day, it's just another day)
(It's just another day, it's just another day)
(It's just another day, it's just another day)
(It's just another day, it's just another day)
(It's just another day, it's just another day)
(It's just another day, it's just another day)
(It's just another day, it's just another day)1Embed
