Not Beautiful Anymore Lyrics

You can be with somebody you like to be with and just touch their cheek or hold their hand and it's the most beautiful thing in the world
You don't need sex under LSD
You don't have to - you don't have to – that – it's – it's... I would – I would think it's just... I don't know what's... It's a weird trip
I don't think that... having children... could make up for what I'm gonna get out of it eventually
You can – you can be with somebody you like to be with and just touch their cheek or hold their hand and it's the most beautiful thing in the world
You don't need sex under LSD
Because... because you're so satisfied with just holding hands that going... going for more than – than that isn't beautiful anymoreEmbed
