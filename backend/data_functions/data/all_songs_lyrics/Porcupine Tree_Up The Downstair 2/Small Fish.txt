Small Fish LyricsThe first thing that I saw as
The fisherman smiled at me
Were fields of empty people
Floating out to sea
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
The small fish gave a cry
The next thing that I saw as
Things were fading fast
Were dreams of children's laughter
Smouldering to dust
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
The small fish gave a cry
The last thing that I saw as
My life passed by
Were fields of empty people
Laying down to die
The rain lashed down in darkness
A lizard blinked an eye
And time stopped in the silence
To watch the burning skyEmbed
