Fadeaway Lyrics

I sat in the room with a view
The girl in the photograph knew
Can't you see?
Why is she laughing at me?

I stumbled through the dark unaware
The face in the hall isn't there
Tomorrow has gone
Where do the voices come from?


Watching the leaves as they blew
Lost in the room with a view
Climb the wall
You did not know me at all

I fell through a hole in the floor
The audience cried out for more
Fadeaway
It's just another day
Hit heaven far too high
Hit heaven far too high
Hit heaven far too high
Hit heaven far too high
Hit heaven far too high
Hit heavenEmbed
