On Lankershim LyricsAnd it all but seems my lifetime dreams have ended
And I know some people hope they won't come true
On Lankershim, Lankershim
Lankershim, I can't stop doing it anymore
I can see flamingo trees of envy
Locked upon the poles of death for you
Well it just gets bigger till you can't seem to figure out
I walk away but I still can't seem to figure it out
I walk away, yeah
I walk away, I walk away
I walk away, I walk away
When someone loves you but you just can't figure it out
Just walk away, just walk away, just walk away
Oh, you walked away
You walked away
Forever, forever, and ever, and ever, and ever
Well, you spent time trying to make it
But you spent your money getting high
Well I know can make it back 'cause I'm only 25
And my friend, she's only 20
And she's an actress and so far
She said, you know, she said she can get me partsEmbed
