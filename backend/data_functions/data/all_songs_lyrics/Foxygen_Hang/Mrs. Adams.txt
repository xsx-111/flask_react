Mrs. Adams LyricsHere I am
In this Hollywood bar
Press my face against the glass
Can't you see I'm making reservations?
Ah, for her birthday
Hey, Mrs. Adams
What you doing now with a gun in your mouth?
Jokers and clowns you just feel down
Hey!
Oh, I got to go with you
Don't you believe 'em, when you seem 'em coming down
'Cause you'll end up in the ground
Ah hey, Jackie, can't you seem 'em coming down
From the attic with Sam? That's me
And it don't you feel down, just feel down on your birthday?
Poor Mrs. Adams with the corpse in her attic
And her birthday party's at seven
Oh, God, it's almost eleven
Oh lord, we got to go, we got to go
Oh, I got to go
Poor Mrs. Adams in the snow
Now I'm hanging from a rope
Huh!
Just hang on, Mrs. Adams
You spend your money now that you know you got away, yeah
Just hang on, Mrs. Adams
Put the pieces back down in the ground
Just hang on, Mrs. Adams
You spend your money now that you know you got away, yeah
Just hang on, Mrs. Adams
Put the pieces back down in the ground
Mrs. Adams!Embed
