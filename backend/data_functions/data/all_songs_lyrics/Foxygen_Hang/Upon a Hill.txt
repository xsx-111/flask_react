Upon a Hill Lyrics
I sit upon a hill
And through the windowsill, she slowly sings a song for me
And in her eyes, she hands me my disguise
And served upon a plate, my heart would slowly rot and die and just be buried in the trees
And if I ever see the sun, it'll be for everyone
Not just for me (Not just for me)
Shalalalalalala, lalalalala (shalalalala)
Someday I'm gonna sit myself right down that hillside there and see

And if our love shall die
Throw our souls up in the sky and candelabra in the sea
Sing a song for me
And it won't be so fine
To just be speaking with our minds
And just be laughing at the trees
And if you see me, give the sign
And just sing a song for me
Oh, the hills roll down
And they silence every living creature's sound
While flamingos dance on spaceships with black fire in their mouths
Sing a song for me
If you see it then just sing a song for me
If you see it then just sing a song for me
If you see it then just sing a song for meEmbed
