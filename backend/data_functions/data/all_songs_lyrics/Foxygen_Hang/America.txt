America LyricsMerry Christmas from the pines
Hallelujah, amen
Just another wish, just another dream
Just a witch who comforts you when you're dying
When you're dying
America
America
How could I have known to have used you?
How could I have known to have used you?

If you're already there, then you're already dead
If you're living in America, whoa
Our heroes aren't brave, they've just got nothing to lose
Because they're all living in America, whoa
In America, whoa
And the movie girl said, "You're wanted on set"
But you only play yourself when you're in Hollywood3Embed
