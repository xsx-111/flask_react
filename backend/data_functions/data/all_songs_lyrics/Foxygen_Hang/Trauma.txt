Trauma Lyrics
For all you people who confuse and abuse
Be gone from your parapets into the fire
Trauma (Trauma)
Trauma (Trauma)
Trauma,  yeah

Ooh, yeah set me free from the trauma
(Trauma) Trauma
(Trauma) Trauma
Everyone has their own trauma (trauma)
Trauma (Trauma)
Trauma just like me
Oh, trauma
If I could get over this trauma (trauma)
Trauma, trauma
Oh, everyone, everyone has their own trauma
Oh, their own trauma
Some are big and some are much larger
Oh, but they come from our mothers and fathers
Among others

I got the paper from the lawn today
Don't get out that much these days, anyway
But how can I tell you if I don't know what to say?
Remember when we used to speak between the stars
And I see you with flamingos in the yard
But how can I love you if I don't know who you are, yeah?
How can I love you if I don't know who you are?
In the cool ocean
Cool ocean
Cool oceanEmbed
