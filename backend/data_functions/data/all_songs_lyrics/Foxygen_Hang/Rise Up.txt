Rise Up Lyrics
Rise up, see for yourself
You got to pull yourself up
From the fires of Hell
Rise up, and see for yourself
When all the world's gone
Nobody else
And when the city spits itself out into that big ocean
The wonderful wisdom of thee

Quite a few shall wonder, very few shall know
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wonders where the red fern grows
Everybody wants to save their souls
And everybody wonders though very few shall know
Wonders where the red fern grows
And everybody wonders where the red fern grows

It's time to wake up early
Start taking care of your health
And start doing all the hard things
And believe in yourself
And follow your own heart, if nothing else
And listen to your own dreams, nobody else's will do, will do
Everybody wonders, very few shall know
Everybody wants to change the world
And everybody wonders where the red fern grows
Everybody wants to save their souls
You've been searching all your life
For something 'til you realized
That what you seek was with you all the time
And everybody wonders where the red fern grows

Sing a song for love, sing a song for love
It's not hard to tell it's Christmas at the Flamingo Hotel
