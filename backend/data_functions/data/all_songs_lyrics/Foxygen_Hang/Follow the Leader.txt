Follow the Leader Lyrics
Hey baby, you know it's true
I'm in love with you
Babe, but you never (Never gonna be what I want)
No, you're never gonna be (Never gonna be what I want)
Yeah, All the shotgun lovers on the avenue
Yes, it's true, he's much too old for you
Babe, but you never (Never gonna be what I want)
No, you're never gonna be (Never gonna be what I want)

I know sometimes everyone wants to be someone else
So follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
And the leader is you
Yeah, follow the leader
Follow the leader
And the leader is you

(Hot fun!) Fun in the summertime
There's no better way to spend our time, baby
But that's never (Never really what's it's about)
No, no, no, no, that's never really what it's about
Oh yeah, I know what you're thinking
You could never get me to cheat on you
Babe, but it's never (Never really what's it's about)
Stop making me feel (Never really what's it's about)
I know sometimes everyone wants to be someone else
Oh, you people know that's true, yeah
So follow the leader
Follow the leader
Just follow the leader
And the leader is you
Yeah, you follow the leader
Follow, follow the leader
And the leader is you, yeah, you3Embed
