Into the Night LyricsInto the night
I cry out
I cry out your name
Into the night
I search out
I search out your love
Night so dark
Where are you?
Come back in my heart
So dark
So dark
Into the night
Shadows fall
Shadows fall so blue
I cry out
I cry out for you
Night so dark
Where are you?
Come back in my heart
So darkEmbed
