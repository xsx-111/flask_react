Sleeping In Blood City LyricsI'll take you sleeping up the street
I'll take you very softly
I'll take under the parking light
I'll hold you very softly
Just like a soul, your face will shine
Even though your mind's been blown
Was the type of love, a much better kind
When you were on your own?
You are taken, going down
Way down to Blood City
You are taken, going down
Through the bloody red eyes of Blood City
Look above you for the sky is black
And the asphalt is blue
Throw yourself right down on your back
And look at me for what to do
I don't take what is given to me
I just take it from the land
Was the type of love a much better kind
When you were with another man?
You are taken, going down
Right down to Blood City
You are taken, going down
Through the bloody red eyes of Blood City
I'll take you sleeping up the street
I'll take you very softly
I'll take you under the parking lights
And hold you so softly
Just like a soul, your face will shine
Even though your mind's been blown
Was the type of love, a much better kind
WHEN YOU WERE ON YOUR OWN??!!!
You are taken, going down
Right down to Blood City
You are taken, going down
Through the bloody red eyes of BLOOD CITY!Embed
