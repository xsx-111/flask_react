The Fire of Love LyricsThe fire of love is burning deep
The fire of love won't let me sleep
Oh my love, hear this my plea
Because of you, it's burning me
The sun beats down with its fiery glow
Knows I won't see my love no more
I'm sorry for the things I've done
Forgive me dear, my only one
My baby's back, once more she's mine
To have and hold till end of time
The moon shines down from up above
Its light to cool the fire of love
The fire of love
The fire of love
