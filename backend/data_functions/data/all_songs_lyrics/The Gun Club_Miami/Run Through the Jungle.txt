Run Through the Jungle LyricsSome are coming on passenger
Some coming on a freight
Others will come walking
And none have time to wait
I will run through the jungle
I will run through the jungle
I will run through the jungle
And I won't look back
And get me out of this water
Before it starts to rise
I've never been no Christian
I don't want to be baptized
I will run through the jungle
I will run through the jungle
I will run through the jungle
And I won't look back
I started to kill my woman
'Til she lay across the bed
She looked so ambitious
I took back everything I'd said
I will run through the jungle
I will run through the jungle
I will run through the jungle
And I won't look back
I will run through the jungle
I will run through the jungle
I will run through the jungle
And I won't look backEmbed
