Mother of Earth LyricsI've gone down the river of sadness
I've gone down the river of pain
In the dark, under the wires
I hear them call my name
I gave you the key to the highway
And the key to my motel door
And I'm tired of leaving and leaving
I can't come back no more
Oh, my dark-eyed friend
I'm recalling you again
Soft voices that speak nothing
Speak nothing to the end
Oh, Mother of Earth
The blind they call
But, yet stay behind the wall
Their sadness grows like weeds
Upon my thighs and knees
Oh, Mother of Earth
The wind is hot
I tried my best, but I could not
And my eyes fade from me
In this open country2Embed
