Carry Home LyricsCome down to the willow garden
With me
Come go with me
Come go and see
Although I've howled across fields and my eyes
Turned grey
Are yours still the same?
Are you still the same?
Carry Home
I have returned
Through so many highways
And so many tears
Your letter never survived the heat of
My hand
My burning hand
My sweating hand
Your love never survived the heat of
My heart
My violent heart
In the dark
Carry Home
I have returned
Through so many highways
And so many tears
Carry Home to where I am from
Carry to the place that I have come
Carry to the dust and flies behind me
Carry to the cracks and caves on the face of me
Oh, but I didn't change, I just had to work
Yeah, but I didn't change, I just had to work
And now I'm home, and now I'm home
Do you still want me?
Now, that I'm home
Come down to the willow garden with me
Come go with me
Come go and seeEmbed
