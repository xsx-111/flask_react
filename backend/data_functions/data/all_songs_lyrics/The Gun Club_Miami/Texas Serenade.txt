Texas Serenade LyricsHe's dead on the lawn
Of the house that he owned
What will they say about him?
He had medals
He was in the war
What will they say about him?
He had folks in Houston
But, he moved out west
What will they say about him?
The Mexican neighbors
All the women stand crying
What will they say about him? about him?
Always ask me, but I don't know anymore
Always ask me, but I don't care anymore
He was the violent kind
He saved me once or twice
What should I say about it?
I tried so hard
But, I just said "Fuck it!"
And what should I say about him?
Always ask me, but I don't know anymore
Always ask me, but I don't care anymore
That he's dead on the lawn
That he's dead on the lawn
What will they say about him?
What will they say about him?
What will they say about him?
Please don't ask me
Please don't ask meEmbed
