John Hardy LyricsJohn Hardy was a vicious little man
He carried two guns every day
He shot down a man on the West Virginia line
I see John Hardy gettin' away, poor boy
See John Hardy gettin' away
John Hardy went up to that free stone bridge
Where there, he thought he was free
A death to men, called nobody his own
Siad, "Johnny come and go with me" poor boy
"Johnny come and go with me."
John Hardy had a pretty little wife back home
The dress that she wore was blue
She come to the jailhouse with a loud shout
Said, "Johnny, I've been true to you", poor boy
"Johnny, I've been true to you."
She said
John Hardy sent out to the East Coast
Sent for his folks to come and go his bail
But, there was no bail allowed for the murderin' man
They sent John Hardy back to jail
Sent John Hardy back to jail
Who's going to shoe your pretty little feet
Who's gonna glove your hand
Who's gonna kiss your rosy red cheek
It's gonna be that steel drivin' man
Be that steel drivin' man
She said
Now he's sittin' alone there in his cell
Tears rolling down his eyes
He's been the death of many, a poor man
Now, he is ready to die, poor boy
Now he is ready to die
Sigin' "I've been to the east, I've been to the west"
"I've seen this whole wide world around"
"I've been to the river and I've been baptized"
"Take me to my hanging in the ground"
"Take me to my hanging in the ground"
She saidEmbed
