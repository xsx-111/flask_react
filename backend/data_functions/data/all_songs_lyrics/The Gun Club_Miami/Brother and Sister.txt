Brother and Sister LyricsWhy do you keep me
Way underground?
My sight is dying
As was the sound
Why do you paint me
And cover me with jewels?
Where are we going?
What are we going to do?
You used to say, you'd take me home
But, I keep falling to the sister
Brother falls unto the sister
Keep getting pushed further and further
Away
The sins of me
They buzz and hiss in the trees
Their little skeletons
Will harm no one
Why do you always
Bring them back to me
They're kingdom come
And earth will be done
On heaven and earth and me
You used to say, you'd take me home
But, I keep falling to the sister
Brother falls unto the sister
Keep getting pushed further and further
Away
And who is that there
Always beside you
When I count us together
Together we are only two
I had a dream
And there was foxfire in your hair
I am your brother, your lover
I give you my blood
I will follow you anywhere
You used to say, but, you never know
But, I keep falling to the sister
Brother falls unto the sister
Keep getting pushed further and further
AwayEmbed
