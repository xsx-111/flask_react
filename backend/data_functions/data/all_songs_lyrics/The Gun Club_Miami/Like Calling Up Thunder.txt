Like Calling Up Thunder LyricsYou sent a Jack O'Lantern over to my house
To charm me from my kill
I've crosses far too much to bear
But, you said you will
Now, you look away, look away
Look away, and leave me alone
I'm calling up thunder
Hands to the open sky
Calling up thunder
To the wind and open sky
To help myself
To help myself
I'm calling up thunder
I'm calling up thunder
With the tears warm against your red dress
Embedded in my brain
I see that we were alike
But, we were not the same
Now, you look away, look away
And leave me all alone
I'm calling up thunder
Hands to the open sky
I'm calling up thunder
To the wind and the open sky
To help myself
To help myself
I'm calling up thunder
I'm calling up thunder
The ghosts, they crawl on the floor
Wondering at it all
I promised I would join them
But, the gesture was too small
Now, I look away, look away
Look away back to myself
I'm calling up thunder
Hands to the open sky
I'm calling up thunder
To the wind and the open sky
To save myself
To save myself
I'm calling up thunder
I'm calling up thunderEmbed
