The Gardener LyricsI sense a runner in the garden
Although my judgements known to fail
Once built a steamboat in a meadow
Cause I'd forgotten how to sail
I know the runner's going to tell you
There ain't no cowboy in my hair
So now he's buried by the daisies
So I could stay the tallest man in your eyes, babe
I sense a spy up in the chimney
From all the evidence I've burned
I guess he'll read it in the smoke now
And soon to ashes I'll return
I know the spy is going to tell you
It's not my flag up in the pole
So now he's buried by the lilies
So I could stay forever more in your eyes, babe
I sense a leak inside my phone now
From all the lies I have told
I know he has your private number
And soon he'll make that vicious call
I know the leak is going to tell you
There ain't now puppy on your leash
So now he'll fertilize the roses
So I could stay the king you see
In your eyes, babe
In your eyes, babe
So now we're dancing through the garden
And what a garden I have made
And now that death will grow my jasmine
I find it soothing I'm afraid
Now there is no need for suspicion
There ain't no fraud kissing your hand
I won't be lying when I tell you
That I'm a Gardener
I'm a man
In your eyes, babe
In your eyes, babe
In your eyes, babe
In your eyes, babe6Embed
