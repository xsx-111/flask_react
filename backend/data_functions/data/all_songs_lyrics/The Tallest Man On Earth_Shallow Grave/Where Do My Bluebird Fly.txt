Where Do My Bluebird Fly LyricsOh, well I know you stroke the set-up baby
Of all the leaves up in the ground
And I know our song is old but heavy
As I see dry leaves fallin' down, oh
With all this fever in my mind
I could drown in your kerosene eyes
Oh, you're just a riddle in the sky
Oh, where do my bluebird fly?
And as the early sigh of dawn will thunder
I see you stir the fog around
And when you find the voice and gears of sunset
We'll hear that high and lonesome sound, oh
And I will question every wind
If they gone through the glow of your eyes, oh
You're just a riddle in the sky
Oh, where do my bluebird fly?
I say, where do my bluebird fly?
Oh, well I know you stroke your feathers baby
Upon the ghosts along my trail
And I know well I was sold and buried
Before I knew it was for sale, oh
With all this fever in my mind I could aim for your kerosene eyes, oh
You're just a target in the sky
I say, where do my bluebird fly?
I say, where do my bluebird fly?Embed
