This Wind LyricsNobody knew what the raven would do
If he found you with rain in your hands
Like a dog set on wheels you will lope down the street
From the sound of the scratch in his claws
As the buildings grew high you knew nothing bout time
But an arrow just brushin' your chin
You said, "Damn be this wind is still movin' on in
To the bones and the bed of my soul."
You said, "Damn be this wind it's still movin' on in
To the bones and the bed of my soul."
Like a fox on the run from the well-informed son
With the bearings for cannonball love
Just like nobody said where that eagle was fed
'Till you stood on the black cross in June
Just like nobody said where that eagle was fed
'Till you stood on the black cross in June
And nobody said that the raven was dead
So you hid all your tears in the grass
Sure, it could look like dew, but they're laughin' at you
And they'll send in their clowns when you're lost
Sure, it could look like dew, but they're laughin' at you
And they'll send in the clowns when you're lost
You said, "Damn be this wind it's still movin' on in
To the bones and the bed of my soul."Embed
