Into the Stream LyricsI've set the rain
To be cold and hard
I've set the sun
To be bright and sharp
To wake you up
From your hollow dream
I'll shake your bed
With a thunder strike
From my hand
Let's come all steal
We will lie and cheat
And turn around
All their limit signs
And redirect this
This great old boring road
Into the depths
Of a lion's mouth
Just to see
If there's something we believe
Our dog will drink
Till the ocean's gone
And he will pull
Till the collar breaks
And everyone
That he will run down
Will see his limbs
As they grow and bleed
But we'll see
If there's something they believe
Let's say goodbye
To the weather girl
Just let her die
When we killed her sound
And when the screen
Is all dark and charged
The limousine
Will be parked outside
In the street
For us to throw into the stream1Embed
