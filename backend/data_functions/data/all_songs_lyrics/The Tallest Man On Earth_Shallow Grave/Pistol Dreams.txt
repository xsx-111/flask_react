Pistol Dreams LyricsSo deep into the orchard you will stumble on the skin of snakes
So let me know your nerves, we'll lose the road
And I will boil the curtains to extract the drugs of springtime
But the unicorn it stirs up as a mule
I said throw me in the fire now, c'mon
I said throw me in the fire now, c'mon
And far out on the ocean with a colored nail I'll force the whale
We'll tattoo all our crimes across his back
Can't you see him swim up to the harbor of the city with the shiver in our buildings as we drown
I said throw me in the fire now, c'mon
I said throw me in the fire now, c'mon
Cause we will paint our house with water
To have an outlet for the sigh
And as I never see the changes
I will be useless as I try
As I say baby don't cry
You said I look just like Mosiah on a cloudy night just findin' out
The wise men lost but still they found a son
And deep into the orchard you will lead me by the skin of snakes
To let me know my sentence as they dry
I said throw me in the fire now, c'mon
I said throw me in the fire now, c'mon
Cause we will paint our house with water
To have an outlet for the sigh
And as I never see the changes
I will be useless as I try
As I say baby don't cry
The colors of the water streams been floatin' through our pistol dreams a long time
And I never went to see the fall before the barrel builder call
Forgive, oh me
You said throw me in the fire now, c'mon
I said throw me in the fire now, c'mon
Cause we will paint our house with water
To have an outlet for the sigh
And as I never see the changes
I will be useless as I try
As I say baby don't you cry1Embed
