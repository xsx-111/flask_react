Shallow Grave LyricsCome see the ripples on the water
As I throw pebbles in the pond
To let the sky go past its surface
Empty my pockets filled with stones
My pockets filled with stones
Come see the sadness of the sailor
As I will scratch his deep blue floor
Already in my years of bad luck
Oh, I broke his mirror long before
Oh when I dive into the water
I've raised the bottom to be saved
It's just a shallow grave
I found the darkness in my neighbor
I found the fire in the frost
I found the season once claimed healthy
Oh, I need the guidance of the lost
But when I dive into the water
I've raised the bottom to be saved
It's just a shallow grave
'Cause when I dive into the water
I've raised the bottom to be saved
It's just a shallow grave
It's just a shallow graveEmbed
