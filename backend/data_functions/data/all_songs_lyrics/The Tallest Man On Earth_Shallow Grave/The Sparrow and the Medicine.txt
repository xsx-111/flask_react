The Sparrow and the Medicine LyricsWhen you mend the patches of my clothin'
You know every thread goes through my heart
Guessin' that the river's gonna dry up
Well, I said that's not the reason why we bard
Lookin' 'round the corner where I left you
Wonderin' whatever led me there
Knowin' that a quiet, unconscious feeling
Could be bought to drown a memory anywhere
She said, "I don't want your medicine and I don't need the sparrow in my heart"
When I'm covered by the thunder I get rid of all your breath deep in my lungs
Splayed in the wind apart
And when I touch the ceiling on a spring day
Wishin' it could heed up every crow
So that they could lift me by my shoulders
Take me from this frozen lake and let you know
Just that I want to be your medicine I want to feed the sparrow in your heart
When I'm covered by the thunder I'll get rid of all the breath deep in our lungs
Splayed in the wind apart
Hell I'm still standing 'round the corner where I left you
Diggin' up a quite sufficient track
Never know when you're behind that angle with a tranquilizer gun in your sweet pair
Oh I want to be your medicine I want to feed the sparrow in your heart
When we're covered by the thunder we'd become just one and feel the lightning shard
Splayed in the wind apartEmbed
