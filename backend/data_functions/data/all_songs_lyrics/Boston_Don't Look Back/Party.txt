Party Lyrics
Oh yeah, well you know I don't get off on working day after day
I wanna have some fun while I'm here
I play the game when its going my way
And theres nothing like a party when its kicking into gear
Im getting ready for a party tonight
Yes Im getting ready to cruise
And if you've got something for me
Ive got something for you

Baby, its a party and nobody cares
What we're doing there
Baby, its a party as long as you're there
Its a party, party, party

I can't believe it when some people say
That it's a sin that way we live to die
You know, there's never been a more natural thing
There's a brand new story, but it's the same old lie
So come on get ready for the time of your life
Cause I'm getting right in the groove
And if you've got something for me
Ive got something for you
So come on, oh come on, let's go get down

Get down and party if you need a cue
You're sure to find one in the crowd
Just meet your friends and have a toke or two
In a place where they can never play the music too loud
And get ready for a party tonight
Cause Im getting right in the groove
And if you've got something for me
Ive got something for you


Now a man doesn't live on bread alone
He's got to have some loving each and every night
And a woman's got to have it if the truth be known
Let's get together honey, it's alright
I said, let's get together honey, it's alright
So come on, let's get together honey, it's alright

Aww, get down
Get down and partyEmbed
