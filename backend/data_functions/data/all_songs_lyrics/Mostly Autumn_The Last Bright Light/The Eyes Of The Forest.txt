The Eyes Of The Forest LyricsI have seen you cutting down trees
Trees that were planted
To aid you to breathe
And I've seen you pluck carelessly
Fruit yet unripened
Then discard their seeds
Over mist, through leaves
I have seen
Change in the fields
Where corn once stood in sheaves
Scattering poisons?
Tainting our earth
No salute to life's cycle
No hope of rebirthEmbed
