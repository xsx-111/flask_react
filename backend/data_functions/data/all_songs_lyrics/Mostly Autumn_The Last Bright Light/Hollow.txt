Hollow LyricsI remember who you are
If you take me back I'll follow
Your eyes are bright in a tunnel of dark
You look different, have you changed your ways?
You'll still be here tomorrow
That keeps you fighting for today
You walk with a dream in your bag
That you've carried through all
The good times and bad
You've followed the road
To the top of the world
Too long
Deepest senses, patient time
Don't waste your final chances
You cannot hold on to the fire
It makes no difference
How it ends
The days have left you hollow
Too fast around the bendEmbed
