Half The Mountain LyricsHalf the mountain shines
Half the water shines
But all of my heart
Is burning slowly
All of my heart
Is burning quietly
Half the raincloud falls
Half the thunder rolls
But all of my heart
Is burning slowly
All of my heart
Is burning quietly
All of my heart is missing you
The woman inside me has gone
And the night falls cold
But all of my heart is burning
But all of my heart is burning quietly
All of my heart is missing youEmbed
