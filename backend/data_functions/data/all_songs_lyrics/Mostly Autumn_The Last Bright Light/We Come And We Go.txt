We Come And We Go LyricsWe come and we go
In the time it takes to think
Someone else must take control
We live and we dream
If we try to take it all
We're really gonna miss the show
We come and we go
But I know
It's something to believe
It's just a matter of time
What a dance, what a play
It's something to believe
It's just a matter of time
What a gift, the starry sky
Scatters time across the world
The chorus of a bird in flight
In the wind a sense of change
As we all know in our hearts
Nothing will remain the same
As we come and we go
We'll know
There's something to believe
It's just a matter of time
What a game, what a laugh
It's something to believe
It's just a matter of timeEmbed
