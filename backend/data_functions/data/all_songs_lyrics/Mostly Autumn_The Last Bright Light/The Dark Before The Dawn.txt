The Dark Before The Dawn LyricsDarkness before the dawn
See me turning
Tossing and turning
Heartbreak has swallowed the sun
No more love, no more love
When it's gone, you can't hold on
When it's gone, killing love
Whispers define the dark
The devil's playground
Is pulling my heart
Memories haunt the night
Try so hold on, try to be free
When it's gone, you can't hold on
When it's gone, killing loveEmbed
