The Last Bright Light LyricsI'm grieving for the dreams that you could have had
Mist in the rain, snow on the rising tide
Over and over they disappear
I'm grieving for the love that we should have had
The feeling was there, I just couldn't say the words
Holding you tight as we said goodbye
The last bright light
The last bright light
The last bright light
I'd rather put life in your heart
Than money in your hand
I'd rather put dreams where they could fly
Than let them disappear
In the emptiness
A cold heart dies
I hope that you know that I love you
The bright sun is swelling out of control
Nature is losing a child of her own
Burning her hands she's holding the fort
To the last
The blue pearl is swallowed, snow on the rising tide
Thoughts will scatter like ancient remains
Beyond the night sky
The last bright light
The last bright light
The last bright light
The last bright light
I'd rather put life in your heart
I'd rather put dreams where they can fly
The terrible truth, the tears and the filth
The ghost of a winter so dim in your eyes
Standing alone, the sun in the night
Burning the autumn, the world on its knees
I hope that you know that I love you
I hope that you know that we love you
Away in the emptiness a cold star dies
I know that you know that we'll miss youEmbed
