Mother Nature LyricsTime to look and see
In colurs of time, we know who we are
Breathing the air that is sweet
Time to think of her
Here's to the lady, her eyes never sleep
With every weather that ends
Breaking the towers and tables of land
She's holding the skies to defend
All of us
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries
Time for love of her
Taken for granted, we know that you are
Alone with the cold of the stone
Painting your pictures on great Western skies
The world on its knees below
For all of us
All of us
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for love
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for love
In the golden fields, the rain
As the summer feels a change
On the mountains dressed in gold
As the wind blows through her hair
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for love
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for love
Sometimes, sometimes
Sometimes
She cries out for loveEmbed
