Shrinking Violet LyricsSafe until the darkness falls
To loneliness a demon calls
Creeping in, arousing my fears
To breathe a language that noone else hears
Can I cope alone tonight?
The shrinking violet I've become inside
To you I may seem insecure
But did you know me what I was before?
I remember dancing as a child
A careless confidence danced with me
Whatever happened to the sun?
Only seemed to notice when it had gone
Lead me back to where it seems
I danced alone in sunlit dreams
Unafraid to play with fire
With a view through a child's eyes, naive and wild
Can I cope alone tonight?
The shrinking violet I've become inside
To you I may seem insecure
But did you know me what I was before?
I remember dancing as a child
A careless confidence danced with me
Whatever happened to the sun?
Only seemed to notice when it had gone
If I ever meet again with her
Could I tell her I could live with her?
If I ever meet again with her
I will tell her I could live with her
I will cope alone tonight
I'll fight these demons that I've tried to describe
I won't be so insecure
I will show you what I was before
I will dance then as a child
A careless confidence will dance with me
I'll be warmed there by the sun
You would notice when I had goneEmbed
