Six White Horses LyricsSix white horses coming two by two
Six white horses coming two by two
Coming for my mother, no matter how I love her
Six white horses coming two by two
Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels
Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels
So broken hearted, up now they started
Woah now horses! Easy on the wheels
See them horses pulling on a rein
See them horses pulling on a rein
Sunshine and Sorrow, Yesterday, Tomorrow
Bedlam and Barlow Billy are their names
Some bright morning, what will you see?
Some bright morning, what will you see?
Some bright morning looking on it coming
Some bright morning, what will you see?
There's six white horses coming after me
Six white horses coming after me
Pretty as a picture, certain as the scripture
Six white horses coming after meEmbed
