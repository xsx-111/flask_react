Scarlet Town LyricsBuddy I went down to Scarlet Town
Ain't never been there before
Well, you slept on a feather bed
I slept on the floor
Now I don't mind a lean old time
Or drinking my coffee cold
But the things I seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul
Well, look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
Now I spent some time in New Orleans
And in Cairo on a bend
But Scarlet Town brought me down
Low as I ever been
Ahh, look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
On the day I came to Scarlet Town
You promised I'd be your bride
You left me here to rot away
Like Polly on the mountainside
Ahh, look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
Now you may hide in Scarlet Town
For a hundred years or more
But the man who knows what time it is
Is knocking at the door
So fare you well, my own true love
If you ever see me around
I'll be looking through a telescope
From hell to Scarlet Town
Now, look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town todayEmbed
