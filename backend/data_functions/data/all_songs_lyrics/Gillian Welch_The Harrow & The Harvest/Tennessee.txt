Tennessee LyricsI kissed you 'cause I've never been an angel
I learned to say Hosannas on my knees
But they threw me out of Sunday school when I was nine
And the sisters said I did just as I please
Even so, I try to be a good girl
It's only what I want that makes me weak
I had no desire to be a child of sin
Then you went and pressed your whiskers to my cheek
Fa la li li, fa la li lee
Now let me go, my honey-o, back to Tennessee
It's beefsteak when I'm working
And whiskey when I'm dry
And sweet heaven when I die
Now I've tried drinking rye and gambling
Dancing with damnation is a ball
But of all the little ways I've found to hurt myself
Well you might be my favorite one of all
Fa la li li, fa la li lee
Now let me go, my honey-o, back to Tennessee
It's beefsteak when I'm working
Whiskey when I'm dry
Sweet heaven when I die
Why can't I go and live the life of Riley?
Why can't I go back home to apple pie?
'Cause your affront to my virtue was a touch too much
But you left a little twinkle in my eye
Fa la li li, fa la li lee
Now let me go, my honey-o, back to Tennessee
It's beefsteak when I'm working
And whiskey when I'm dry
And sweet heaven when I die
Now some had come confessing of transgressions
And some had come confessing of their love
You were there strumming on your gay guitar
You were trying to tell me something with your thumb
Fa la li li, fa la li lee
Now let me go, my honey-o, back to Tennessee
It's beefsteak when I'm working
And whiskey when I'm dry
And sweet heaven when I dieEmbed
