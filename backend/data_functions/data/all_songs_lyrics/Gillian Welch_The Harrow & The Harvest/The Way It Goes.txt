The Way It Goes LyricsBecky Johnson bought the farm
Put a needle in her arm
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
And her brother laid her down
In the cold Kentucky ground
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
That's the way that it goes
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when she and I were friends
Well, Miranda ran away
Took her cat and left LA
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
She was busted, broke and flat
Had to sell that pussycat
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
That's the way that it goes
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when he and I were friends
See the brightest ones of all
Early in October fall
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
While the dark ones go to bed
With good whiskey in their heads
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
Now Billy Joe's back in the tank
You tell Musso, I'll tell Frank
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
Did he throw her down a well?
Did she leave him for that swell?
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
That's the way that it goes
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when all of us were friends
When you lay me down to rest
Leave a pistol in my vest
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
Do you miss my gentle touch?
Did I hurt you very much?
That's the way that it goes
That's the way
That's the way that it goes
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
That's the way that it ends
Though there was a time when you and I were friendsEmbed
