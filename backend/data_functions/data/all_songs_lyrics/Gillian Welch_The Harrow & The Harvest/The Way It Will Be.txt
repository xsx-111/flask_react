The Way It Will Be LyricsI lost you awhile ago
Still I don't know why
I can't say your name
Without a crow flying by
Gotta watch my back now
That you turned me around
Got me walking backwards
Into my hometown
Throw me a rope
On the rolling tide
What did you want me to be?
You said it's him or me
The way you made it
That's the way it will be
We were seven years on the Burma shore
With Gatling guns and paint
Working the lowlands door-to-door
Like a Latter-Day Saint
Then you turned me out
At the top of the stair
And you took all the glory
That you just couldn't share
I've never been so disabused
I've never been so mad
I've never been served anything
That tasted so bad
You might need a friend
Any day now, any day
Oh my brother, be careful
You are drifting away
Throw me a rope
On the rolling tide
What did you want me to be?
You said it's him or me
The way you made it
That's the way it will be
The way you made it
That's the way it will beEmbed
