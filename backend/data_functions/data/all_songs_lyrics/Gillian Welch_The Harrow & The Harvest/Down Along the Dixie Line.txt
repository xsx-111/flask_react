Down Along the Dixie Line LyricsWay down in Dixie, oh do they miss me
Down along the Dixie Line
Banjos a-strummin', horseflies a-hummin'
Ripe melons on the vine
The gold and the grey, we'd sing "look away"
Way down along the Dixie Line
I spent my childhood walking the wildwood
Down along the Dixie Line
Freight trains a-squallin', highballs a-ballin'
Four engines at a time
I was so happy with Momma and Pappy
Down along the Dixie Line
Can't you hear those drivers wail?
Can't you see those bright rails shine?
Gonna catch that fireball mail
Leave the North Land far behind
A river of whiskey flows down in Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line
They pulled up the tracks now, I can't go back now
Can't hardly keep from crying
Oh do they miss me way down in Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line
Can't you hear those drivers wail?
Can't you see those bright rails shine?
Wanna catch that fireball mail
Leave the north land far behind
Down along the Dixie LineEmbed
