Seven Days LyricsOne
One day, one day of paradise
One day, one day of paradise
All truth is opinion, believe me
Discussion has become a privilege
Creativity is a salesman's PR exercise
Style is the new currency
Two
Two days, two days of paradise
Two days, two days of paradise
No-one is safe outside the shopping centres
Reality is just an MTV buzzword
We are all just a target audience
Bigger choice of identical things
Three
Three days, three days of paradise
Three days, three days of paradise
So much to buy, so much to buy
Four
Four days, four days of paradise
Four days, four days of paradise
Life is a metaphor for television
Ideas are now soundbites and they never bite back
Everything is OK at Lies-R-Us
Off-the-pog crowd control
Five
Five days, five days of paradise
Five days, five days of paradise
The community is now anti-social
Do it yourself is against the law
Poverty is a fashion statement
The alternative has become the mainstream
Six
Six days, six days of paradise
Six days, six days of paradise
So much to buy, so much to buy
Seven
Seven days, seven days of paradise
So much to buy, so much to buy
Seven days, seven days of paradise
So much to buy, so much to buyEmbed
