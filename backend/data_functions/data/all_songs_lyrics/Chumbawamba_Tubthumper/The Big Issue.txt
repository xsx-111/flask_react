The Big Issue Lyrics
There are those, spend the night
Under bridges over by the river
Down in the park through the winter
But there's a house that I know
Safe and warm, and no one ever goes there
Down where the priests bless the wine

She's been born into the wrong time
She keeps nonsense on her mind
She's a poet, she's a builder
She's as bored as bored can be
She's a have-not, she's a know-all
She knows just how to say yes
She's skating frozen chaos
'Til the no-good gods are dead

But sometimes in the dead of night
Woken by the city lights
She wonders how she keeps alive

This is the girl who lost the house which
Paid to the man who put up the rent and
Threw out the girl to feather his own sweet home
She's a clueless social climber
Likes the wrong side of the bed
She's a pick-me-up and she's a drink-to-me
In the company of friends
She's tried every variation
She's so common, she's so cold
She's homesick for a future
Can't stomach what she's told

On every street in every town
All her days are up and down
At home among the lost and found

This is the girl who lost the house which
Paid to the man who put up the rent and
Threw out the girl to feather his own sweet home

Here's the good Samaritan
Looks away and carries on
Looks away and carries on

This is the girl who lost the house which
Paid to the man who put up the rent and
Threw out the girl to feather his own sweet home
This is the girl who lost the house which
Paid to the man who put up the rent and
Threw out the girl to feather his own sweet home
(There are those, spend the night)
This is the girl who lost the house which
(Under bridges over by the river)
Paid to the man who put up the rent and
(Down in the park through the winter)
Threw out the girl to feather his own sweet home
(But thereâ€™s a house that I know)
This is the girl who lost the house which
(Safe and warm, and no one ever goes there)
Paid to the man who put up the rent and
(Down where the priests bless the wine)
Threw out the girl to feather his own sweet home

Thank you for every tree and flower
Thank you for every sky of blue
Thank you, I should be every hour
Truly thanking you

(I only recognize two tunes: Silent Night and God Save the Queen.)
(And I only know which is which 'cause one of them everybody stands up to.)Embed
