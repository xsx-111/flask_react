Smalltown LyricsAnd every morning comes too soon
All your nights are sleepless
Poison arrows
To ruin your tomorrows
Below suspicion
Cafes full of people dressed as spies
And all I know
Is guilt for being different
It's always raining stones
There's a killer in the home
In a small town
Everybody looks the same
There are unwritten rules
Unspoken words
Should I pack my fear and go?
I have to leave somehow
Before they run me out of town
I have to leave somehow
And every morning comes too soon
All your nights are sleepless
Poison arrows
To ruin your tomorrows
There are unwritten rules
Unspoken words
Should I pack my fear and go?
I have to leave somehow
Before they run me out of town
I have to leave somehow
I have to leave somehow
Before they run me out of town
I have to leave somehow
I have to leave somehow
Before they run me out of town
I have to leave somehow
I have to leave somehow
Before they run me out of town
I have to leave somehow
