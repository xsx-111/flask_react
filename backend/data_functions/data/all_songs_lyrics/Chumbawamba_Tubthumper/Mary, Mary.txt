Mary, Mary LyricsHail Mary, full of grace
The Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for sinners now and at the hour of our death
Amen
No virgin me
For I have sinned
I sold my soul
For sex and gin
Go call a priest
All meek and mild
And tell him: "Mary no more a child"
It's raining stones
It's raining bile
Throw in the luxury
Of your denial
So I don't deny
I don't make do
I press alarms
Place bets on truth
I'm so up and down
And I love what's not allowed
I was lost, now I see
And now I'm growing old disgracefully
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to
Hail Mary, full of grace
The Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb
Jesus, Holy Mary, Mother of God pray for sinners now and at the hour of our death
Amen
I'll spit on floors
And do more drugs
Burn every bill
Get drunk on love
Wear next to nothing
In the pouring rain
Be a bad example
And do it all again
I'll be un-careful
I'll cause some scenes
And I'll never talk
Of used-to-be's
Tattoo my face
I won't go grey
Be a dancing queen
I'm growing old disgracefully
I'm so up and down
And I love what's not allowed
I was lost, now I see
And now I'm growing old disgracefully
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to Mary?
Whatever happened to
Mary, Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Mary, Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Mary, Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Mary, Mary, Mary, quite contrary
