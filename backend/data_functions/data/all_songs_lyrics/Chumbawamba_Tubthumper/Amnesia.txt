Amnesia Lyrics
Goodbye to the summer
Sold down the river
Unhappy ever after
Well, did you ever?

Did you ever reach for the glued-down penny?
Same old joke and it's not funny
Burns are red, bruises blue
Out with the old, cheated by the new

Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)

You sing the same old verse
Stick like glue, for better or worse
What goes around comes around
Again, again, again

This heart, pulled apart
Hydra fighting, head-to-head
Burns are red, bruises blue
Out with the old, cheated by the new
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)

(Ooh-ooh)
Amnesia
(Ooh-ooh)

Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)

Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)
Do you suffer from long-term memory loss?
(I don't remember)

(Cut the head in half using a bandsaw)
(And scoop the brains out)
(Blast the brain out with water or air)
(Suck the brain out through a hole in the head)
(What about free speech?)
(What about free speech?)
(What about free speech?)
(Look, that's not the point)
(You're giving this place a bad name)
(I've got my position to think of)Embed
