Scapegoat LyricsAftershave and smoke
And the same unfunny jokes
They say they'll take you "anywhere but there"
Believe every half whispered, half remembered lie
Where truth is a luxury they can't afford to buy
Scapegoat, looking for a scapegoat
Scapegoat, looking for a scapegoat
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame
Backed into a corner
He barricades his life
Fastens up the shutters every night
This island is big enough for every castaway
But most of us are looking 'round for someone else to blame
Scapegoat, looking for a scapegoat
Scapegoat, looking for a scapegoat
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame
There's always someone else for you to blame (Scapegoat, looking for a scapegoat)
There's always someone else for you to blame (Scapegoat, looking for a scapegoat)
There's always someone else for you to blame (Scapegoat, looking for a scapegoat)
There's always someone else for you to blame (Scapegoat, looking for a scapegoat)

(Aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune, but what the fuck does that matter?)
(And I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you.)Embed
