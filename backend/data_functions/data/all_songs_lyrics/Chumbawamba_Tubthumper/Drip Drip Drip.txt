Drip Drip Drip Lyrics
Eat, sleep and crap
For it to prey on your needs
Down a dark street
In backwater Leeds
I seen yer comin'
Come in, lads!
You seen the ads?
Too bad, bad, bad
What you get
Is what you see
It's trickle-down theory
And it's coming to me
Life's a whip-round
And I got the whip
It's a sinking ship
Drip, drip, drip

Drip-drip-drip goes the water
Drip-drip-drip goes the water
Drip-drip-drip goes the water
Drip-drip-drip goes the water

Take me in
Throw me out
Put me up
Let me down
Dark, satanic
Run-of-the-mill
Sing us a song
And I'll send you the bill
My nicotine grip
My smoking gun
It's how I get my fun
Better run, run, run
Your olfactory nerves
All up the spout
You can't smell a rat
When your nose is out
Rent to kill
By any other name
Kiss an old flame
Shame, shame, shame

Drip-drip-drip goes the water
Drip-drip-drip goes the water
Drip-drip-drip goes the water
Drip-drip-drip goes the water

Take me in
Throw me out
Put me up
Let me down

Drip-drip-drip
Drip-drip-drip
Drip-drip-drip
Drip-drip-drip
Drip-drip-drip
Take me in
Drip-drip-drip
Throw me out
Drip-drip-drip
Put me up
Drip-drip-drip
Let me down
Drip-drip-drip
Take me in
Drip-drip-drip
Throw me out
Drip-drip-drip
Put me up
Drip-drip-drip
Let me down
(Get this guy out of the way)
(Hey! Hey!)
(Excuse me!)
(Could you move, please?)
(Whoever you are)
(Since he's wearing a tie, it doesn't mean to say you're bloody important)Embed
