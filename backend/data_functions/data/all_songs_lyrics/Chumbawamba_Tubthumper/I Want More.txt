I Want More LyricsBlue-rinse sugar
Wipe-clean couple
Pinched last supper
Counting pretty penny
John Betjeman
Some dead liar
Quiet pink picture
Under heavy manners
This is tearoom England
They'll kick your face in so politely
This is tearoom England
They'll kick your face in oh so nicely
I want more!
No hurry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
Don't worry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
No hurry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
Don't worry (More!)
So sorry (I want)
Bite-size china
Tea or tartar
Lipstick traces
Table set to bless
Sweet charity
Lukewarm whisper
Still-life platter
Under heavy manners
This is tearoom England
They'll kick your face in so politely
This is tearoom England
They'll kick your face in oh so nicely
I want more!
No hurry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
Don't worry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
No hurry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
Don't worry (More!)
So sorry (I want)
No Hurry
So sorry
Don't worry
No Hurry
So sorry
Don't worry
I want more!
No hurry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
Don't worry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
No hurry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
Don't worry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
No hurry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
Don't worry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
No hurry (More!)
So sorry (I want more!)
Don't worry (More!)
(I want more!)
(More! I want more!)
(More! I want more!)
(More! I want more!)
