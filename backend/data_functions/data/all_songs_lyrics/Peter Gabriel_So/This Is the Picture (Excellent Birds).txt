This Is the Picture (Excellent Birds) Lyrics
Flying birds, excellent birds
Watch them fly
There they go
Falling snow, excellent snow
Here it comes
Watch it fall
Long words, excellent words
I can hear them now

This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture

I'm sitting by the window
Watching the snow fall
I'm looking out
And I'm moving, turning in time
Catching up, moving in
Jump up
I can land on my feet, look out
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture
This is the picture

Looking out, watching out
When I see the future I close my eyes
I can see it now

I see pictures of people
Rising up
Pictures of people
Falling down
I see pictures of people
They're standing on their heads, they're ready
I see pictures of people
Rising up
I see pictures of people
Falling down
I see pictures of people
They're standing on their heads, they're ready
They're looking out
Look out
They're watching out
Watch out
They're looking out
Look out
They're watching out
Watch, watching out
I see pictures of people
I see pictures of people
They're watching, they're watching
I see pictures of people
They're watching out, watch out
I see pictures of people
They're watching out, watch out
I see pictures of people
They're watching, they're watching
I see pictures of people
They're watching out, watch out
I see pictures of peopleEmbed
