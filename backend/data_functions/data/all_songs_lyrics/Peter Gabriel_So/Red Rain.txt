Red Rain Lyrics
Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

I am standing up at the water's edge in my dream
I cannot make a single sound as you scream
It can't be that cold, the ground is still warm to touch
Hey, we touch
This place is so quiet, sensing that storm

Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

Well I've seen them buried in a sheltered place in this town
They tell you that this rain can sting and look down
There is no blood around, see no sign of pain
Hey, no pain
Seeing no red at all, see no rain
Red rain is coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

Red rain
Oh! Oh!
Putting the pressure on much harder now
To return again and again
Red rain
Just let the red rain splash you
Let the rain fall on your skin
Red rain
I come to you, defenses down
With the trust of a child
Oh!

Red rain coming down
Red rain
Red rain is pouring down
Pouring down all over me

And I can't watch anymore
No more denial
It's so hard to lay down in all of this
Red rain coming down
Red rain is pouring down
Red rain is coming down all over me
I see it

Red rain coming down
Red rain is pouring down
Red rain is coming down all over me
I'm bathing in

Red rain coming down
Red rain is coming down
Red rain is coming down all over me
I'm begging you

Red rain coming down
Red rain coming down
Red rain coming down
Red rain coming down
Over me in the red, red sea
Over me
Over me
