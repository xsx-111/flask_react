Solo LyricsGood morning, good afternoon
And what have you got to say?
Well I'm waiting, but I can't stay long
It's such a lovely day
There's a time to be talking
And a time when it's no use
Right now I think the things you say
Are liable to confuse
I've just gone solo
Do you play solo?
Ain't life a solo?
What a wonderful way to live
She's travelling all over the world
Why, the fame and all the golden
Opportunities unfurled
No time for the gent with the Mulliner Bentley
And heaven knows what else
Why, he wouldn't even stand a chance
With all his oil-wells
She just went solo
Do you play solo?
Ain't life a solo?
I've always lived in a mansion
On the other side of the moon
I've always kept a unicorn
And I never sing out of tune
I could tell you that the grass is really greener
On the other side of the hill
But I can't communicate with you
And I guess I never will
We've all gone solo
We all play solo
Ain't life a solo?Embed
