Whispering Grass LyricsWhy do you whisper, green grass
Why tell the trees what ain't so?
Whispering grass
The trees don't have to know
Why tell them all your secrets
Who kissed there long ago?
Whispering grass
The trees don't need to know
Don't you tell it to the breeze
'Cos she will tell the birds and bees
And everyone will know
Because you told them once before
Yes you told them once before
It's no secret anymore
Why tell them all the old things
They're buried under the snow
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees
'Cos the trees don't need to know
Now don't you tell it to the breeze
'Cos she will tell the birds and bees
And everyone will know
Because you told them once before
Yes you told them once before
It's no secret anymore
Why tell them all the old things
They're buried under the snow
Whispering grass, don't tell the trees
'Cos the trees don't need to knowEmbed
