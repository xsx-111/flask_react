Friends LyricsI've watched you rise up and I've watched you fall down
'Til you've lost everything but what money can own
And you feel alright now, but for how long?
You feel alright now, how long?
Do me a favour, stay away from my door
I could use some good company but I don't care for yours
No more pageants, no more
No more pageants, no more
I find your words empty and you know as a rule
To you I have purposefully never been cruel
But you waste my time, such fools
You waste my time, such fools
My love is not here, my love is away
You've caught me alone but you've nothing to say
And it's time to leave now and you know the way
And it's time to leave and you know the way
Go and live in the country and I'll stay in town
I have everything but what money can own
And I'll be just fine now, so long
I'll be just fine now, so long
So longEmbed
