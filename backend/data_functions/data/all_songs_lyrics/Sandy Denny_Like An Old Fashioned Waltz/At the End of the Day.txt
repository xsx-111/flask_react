At the End of the Day LyricsOh babe you are the one I love
You are the one I'm thinking of
You know it's still a long long way
But I'll be home at the end of the day
I'll sing my songs just for you
And I'll bring my love home to you
I can hardly wait to see your face again
But I'll be home at the end of the day
Just miles and miles of rosy sky
I'll fall asleep by and by
I'm crying now 'cos you're so far away
But I'll be home at the end of the day
Oh babe you are the one I love
You are the one I'm thinking of
So many words I need to say
You'll hear them all at the end of the day
But I'll be home at the end of the dayEmbed
