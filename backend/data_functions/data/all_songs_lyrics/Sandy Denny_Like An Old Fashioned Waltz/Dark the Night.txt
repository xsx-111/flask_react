Dark the Night LyricsLove, oh don't we know how can the river flow
Without you
Warming like the sand upon the land
How can we doubt you?
Dark to me the night and dim the morning light
Tomorrow
How can we not see the simple melody
Of sorrow?
Oh to be with you, oh to see them through
Those days when we think you are gone
They are so lonesome, and so long
What shall we do?
Parting comes to soon, my weary tune
Has lost its pleasure
Waiting for the time, this lonely wine
Has lost its treasure
Dark to me the night and dim the morning light
Tomorrow
How can we not see the simple melody
Of sorrow?
Oh to be with you, oh to see them through
These days when we think you are gone
They are so lonesome, and so long
What shall I do?Embed
