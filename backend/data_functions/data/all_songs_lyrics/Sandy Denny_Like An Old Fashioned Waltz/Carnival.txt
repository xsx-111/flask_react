Carnival LyricsThe Summertime's escaping, and the carnival's away
And the sunshine is awaiting for another sunny day
Breakers whisper to the shells upon the shore
And hear the seagulls they cry for more
And hear the gulls they cry for more
Good day to you sweet Autumn, so gently you appear
Why I never even realised those rustic times were near
The moment's changing from a dusty green to gold
The Summer fair she has grown old
The Summer fair she has grown old
And away in the blue of the skies and over the trees
How the carnival flies on the wings of a breeze
You've had your time and now it's mine for me to go
These colder days they move too slow
These older days they move too slow
So the Summertime is leaving, and the carnival's away
So the sunshine is relieving us of all our sunny days
But I'll be waiting for to greet your fleeting calls
So come back soon the carnival
So come back soon the carnival
Come back soonEmbed
