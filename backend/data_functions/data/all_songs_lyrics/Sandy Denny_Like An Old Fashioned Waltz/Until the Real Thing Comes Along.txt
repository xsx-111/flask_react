Until the Real Thing Comes Along LyricsI'd work for you, I'd even slave for you
I'd be a beggar or a knave for you
And if that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
I'd gladly move the earth for you
To prove my love dear and its worth for you
And if that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
With all the words dear at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you darling, come what may
My heart is yours, what more can I say
I'd sigh for you, I'd cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky fo you
And if that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
I'd sigh for you, I'd cry for you
I'd tear the stars down from the sky fo you
And if that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes alongEmbed
