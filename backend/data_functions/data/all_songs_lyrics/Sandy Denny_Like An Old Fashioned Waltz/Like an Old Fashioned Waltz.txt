Like an Old Fashioned Waltz LyricsRoses are red, and violets are blue
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls
Like the music we hear
Those things we'll always hold dear
Like an old fashioned waltz
When the moonlight shines down
On the Hollywood world
And the heroine waits for her beau to return
And violins play from behind garden walls
How I'd love to remain with the silver refrain
Of an old fashioned waltz
As they dance round the floor
And there's no-one else there
And the world is no more and there's never a care
By the perfect lagoon where the nightingale calls
With only the moon and the nostalgic tune
Of an old fashioned waltz
Roses are red and violets are blue
Primroses pale on a velvet green hue
Warm summer days by cool waterfalls
Like the music we hear
Those things we'll always hold dear
Like an old fashioned waltz
Like an old fashioned waltz
An old fashioned waltzEmbed
