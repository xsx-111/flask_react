Jellybones LyricsFor so long, I trailed you, now here I am
But I can't stand with these jellybones
Checked myself into emergency, urgently
Drove up in my bone-camarrow, thinking only about you
The doctor walked her crew of surgeons to the table where I lay
I came to, and my kneecaps were off
And they were soft, I had jellybones
I woke him up and broke the news
After everything was sewn
"Son, you've got a full-blown case
Of what is known as jellybones"

Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jellybones
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jelly, jelly, jelly
Jelly, jellybones...

But this is love, so we'll survive
This is love, so we'll survive
But this is love, so we'll survive
This is love, so we'll survive
This is love, so we'll survive
This is love, so we'll survive1Embed
