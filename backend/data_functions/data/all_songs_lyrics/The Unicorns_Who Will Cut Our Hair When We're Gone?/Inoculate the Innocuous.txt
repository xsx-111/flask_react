Inoculate the Innocuous LyricsSmall doses, daily
Absorbed and collected
In the glands and fatty tissues
Over time, over time, oh
Somewhere in the asshole of my eye
There's a muscle which relaxes when you cry
Somewhere in the eye of my brain
There's a muscle which makes me go
Storage cells for hidden substance
But new flavours and aromas go on
Reflect on your absence
Genuflect in my presence
Remove your abscess
They say it's cancer
(Flavourful, beautiful, flavourful, beautiful)
(Flavourful, beautiful, flavourful, beautiful)
(Beautiful, flavourful, beautiful...)
(Beautiful, flavourful, beautiful, flavourful)
(Ah...)
Bananas help me unwind
Watermelon makes it awesome1Embed
