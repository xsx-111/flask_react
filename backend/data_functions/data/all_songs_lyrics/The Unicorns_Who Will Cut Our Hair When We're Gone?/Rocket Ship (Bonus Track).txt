Rocket Ship (Bonus Track) LyricsI'm going on a trip far away
I'm leaving today
I'm leaving today
Rocket ship
Rocket ship
My bags are packed and I'm ready to go
My bags are packed and I'm ready to go-o-o
To Planet X
There's this girl there
Her name is X, I'll say, "Hello
You don't know me, but I don't know you either"
(Okay, baby, let's make this one.)
(Rocket ship!)
Our bags are packed and we're ready to go
Our bags are packed and we're ready to go-o-o
Stars are blurry, we're moving fast
We're going on a trip far away
We're leaving today
Our home is our rocket ship
