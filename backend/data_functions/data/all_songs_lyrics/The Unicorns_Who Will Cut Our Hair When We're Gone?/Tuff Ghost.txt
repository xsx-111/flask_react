Tuff Ghost Lyrics
Tuff ghost, tuff crowd, tuff love
Sit down, sit down, sit down
Tuff ghost, tuff crowd, tuff love
Sit down, sit down, sit down
Say something now
Say something now

(The tuff ghost disappears for three days
The tuff ghost is set in his ways
I don't want to hurt you)
Well you can't, 'cause I'm already dead
(The tuff ghost is invincible
No guts came out when he bled)
Well I lift weights, but I don't sweat
I go for a swim, but I don't get wet
(I don't careâ€”) I don't care about anyone else
I'm a strong dead man, looking out for himself
(I think you're suffering, that's why you're so mean
You're already dead)

I can see right through...
See right through...
See right through...
Right through you...
See right through...
See right through...
See right through...
See right through...1Embed
