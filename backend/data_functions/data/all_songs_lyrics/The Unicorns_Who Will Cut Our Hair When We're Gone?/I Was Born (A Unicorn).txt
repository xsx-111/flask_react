I Was Born (A Unicorn) Lyrics

I was born a unicorn
I missed the ark but I could've sworn you'd wait for me
I was born a unicorn
I could've sworn you believed in me
Then how come all the other unicorns are dead?

We're never gonna stop
I think I wanna stop
We want one "us"
Okay, I'll do push-ups
I write the song
I write the songs!
You say I'm doing it wrong
You are doing it wrong!

P-P-Put your crystals under my pillow
Send your epistle to my bedfellows
It also says, it also says, it also says

When dreaming beasts are dying down, on out, they're there. We agree they're there. They're there; alive and shorn
If I stop believing in you
If you stop believing in me
If I stop believing in you
If you stop believing in me

We're the Unicorns
We're more than horses
We're the Unicorns
And we're people too!2Embed
