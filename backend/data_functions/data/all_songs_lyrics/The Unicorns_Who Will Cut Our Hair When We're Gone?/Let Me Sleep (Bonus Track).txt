Let Me Sleep (Bonus Track) LyricsJust turn the lights off
Are the curtains drawn?
There's another that should

Just turn the lights off
Are the curtains enough?
There's another that should

I'm so tired
I'm so tired
I'm so tired
I'm so tired
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
I'm so (I'm so) tired (tired)
I'm so (I'm so) tired (tired)
I'm so (so) tired (tired)
I'm so (so) tired (tired)
I'm so tired
