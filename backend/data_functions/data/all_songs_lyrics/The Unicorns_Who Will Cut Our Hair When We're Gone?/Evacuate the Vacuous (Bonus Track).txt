Evacuate the Vacuous (Bonus Track) LyricsSomething warm would be something nice
To keep me from moaning in the morning
And mourning through the night
Alright
Take your things from my house
Evacuate my life
It's over, rescind
Oh oh!
Uh-oh!
And everything's okay
In its own little way
(Everything's oh-oh-oh-okay)
And everything's okay in its own little way
Every thing's okay in its own little way
Every thing's okay in its own special way
And everything's okay
Clap your hands
Clap your hands in slow mo
Clap your hands
As the camera follows us
Slow mo
So, take your things from my house
(Something warm, something nice)
Evacuate my life
(To keep me from moaning in the morning)
It's over, rescind
And mourning through the nightEmbed
