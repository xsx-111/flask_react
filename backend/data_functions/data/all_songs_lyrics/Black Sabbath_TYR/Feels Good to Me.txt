Feels Good to Me LyricsThe chapter is opened and the pages are turned
The writing say many things but who was concerned
Where can we run to now, when will we learn?
When it's lost, it's gone forever
For years they told me what I should to do
Down to the places I go and who I should talk to
But that don't matter no more since I found out the truth
And it feels good to me
The world is turnin'
Forever turnin'
Forever yearnin'
For the love of life
And you're wrong if you think that I'm afraid to love
It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me
I wonder, I wonder does it not seem strange to you
Just how the tables have turned on me and you?
How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?
When it's lost, it's gone forever
The world is turnin'
Forever turnin'
Forever yearnin'
For the love of life
And you're wrong if you think that I'm afraid to love
It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me
Feels good
It feels good to me
How long can we go on livin', livin' the way we do?
It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels good
Feels good to me
It feels good
It feels good to me
It feels goodEmbed
