The Sabbath Stones LyricsFire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World possessions, endless tears
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years
World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime
Words are poison, passion bleeds
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds
The time of dreams has turned
The night is gone and light shines on
Where darkness once would hide
With spirits high, our fears were born

Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs within you
The reason for your restless heart
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones
Fire and water, wind and rain
Wings that carry hell in every vein
World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime
Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer
Each step brings fear
The eyes of they that see have evil stare
Watch over me

Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs within you
The reason for your restless heart
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones
And He's the keeper of the Sabbath Stones
What God is this that stands to hear his people cry?
What hand would strike and watch his people die?
What life that takes, what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes, take heed the Sabbath Stones
What life that takes, what future did we earn?
It's our mistakesEmbed
