Ego Lyrics
Runnin' wild, round a roundabout
Got it figured out, why you only go in circles
Blue print line all your walls around
All them building blocks
No exit, no exit

Baby I know my gospel but I ain't a preacher
Sorry to burst your bubble, but somebody needs to

We'll feed your ego
Ego
Bang bang baby, down you fall
Ain't you Mister Know-It-All?
Ego
Ego
Bang bang baby, down you fall
Ain't you Mister Know-It-All?

Sing it loud just like you believe
How to perceive
Everything you said was perfect
Livin' life so delusional
You could lose it all
No question, no question
Baby I know my gospel but I ain't a preacher
Sorry to burst your bubble, but somebody needs to

We'll feed your ego
Ego
Bang bang baby, down you fall
Ain't you Mister Know-It-All?
Ego
Ego
Bang bang baby, down you fall
Ain't you Mister Know-It-All?

I bet you stopped to see the car crash, didn't you?
You told yourself that it's a rotten world, didn't you?
Personified the greatness, reaped the rewards
Convinced the words are something real 'til they're strikin' the chord
You musta been
Pushing weights or your headpiece is so big
You so right my brother, what a way to live
Top of the food chain, chuck in the loose change
But who are they to say you got no taste
You got no whole bars, mister know it all
No gold star, he don't know that he won't go far
'Cause he ain't no fool, but he's tucked up at night
With a belly full of "I'm so cool", and that's a lie
Baby I know my gospel but I ain't a preacher (I ain't a preacher)
Sorry to burst your bubble, but somebody needs to

We'll feed your ego
Ego (Something's got to give)
Bang bang baby, down you fall
Ain't you Mister Know-It-All?
Ego
Ego
Bang bang baby, down you fall
Ain't you Mister Know-It-All?

Something's got to give
Something's got to give
Something's got to give
