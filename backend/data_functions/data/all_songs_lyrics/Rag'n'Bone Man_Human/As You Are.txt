As You Are Lyrics
You raised the lights when it was frightening
Calmed the storm when it was rising
You found me there where I was hiding
All I have is here and now

If the ground beneath our feet is disappearing
I'll be here beside you, always be right near you
Remember me, won't you?

I know we've all got our problems
And it's a blessing that we made it here so far
If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise
I promise to take you, take you as you are

When I was reaching out in the dark
When the streets below just looked so far
When I forgot everything that I was
All I needed was your love

If the earth beneath our feet is old and caves in
For a second we are fighting, when it's late in the evening
Don't let me go, dear
I know we've all got our problems
And it's a blessing that we made it here so far
If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise
I promise to take you, take you as you are

Take you as you are, as you are
Take you as you are, as you are
Take you as you are, as you are
As you are

I know we've all got our problems
And it's a blessing that we made it here so far
If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise (I promise)
I promise to take you, take you as you are

I know we've all got our problems
And it's a blessing that we made it here so far
If you lay here in these arms tonight I promise
I promise to take you, take you as you are4Embed
