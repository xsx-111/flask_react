Wolves (Solo Version) Lyrics
Dun dun dun dee-dee dun dun

I don't wanna drown no more
Sick of the same old people
The kind that will sell your soul
Trade it for a shining stone
Ain't nothing in this life for free
Running from the greatest evil
It finally dawned on me
A man's gotta fight temptation

Keep the wolves from the door
I hear them scratching like I don't know better?
Won't you keep the wolves from the door
It won't be long before I cave in and open up the-

I don't wanna go back home
Too many staring faces
Wishing they could drag me down
Waiting to pull me under
I've shaken off my chains
But I still feel those shackles
Living inside of me
I know I gotta fight temptation
Keep the wolves from the door
I hear them scratching like I don't know better
Won't you keep the wolves from the door?
It won't be long before I cave in and open up the-

It's a fine line walking when they're scratching at my door
Head full of voices screaming out for more
And I can see the shining of his blade
And I can see the shining of his blade
It's a slow road to nowhere walking with the dead
It's hard to keep on moving with you hanging 'round my neck
And I can see the shining of his blade
And I can see the shining of his blade

Keep the wolves from the door
I hear them scratching like I don't know better
Won't you keep the wolves from the door
It won't be long before I cave in and open up the-
Keep the wolves from the door
I hear them scratching like I don't know better
Won't you keep the wolves from the door
It won't be long before I cave in and open up the doorEmbed
