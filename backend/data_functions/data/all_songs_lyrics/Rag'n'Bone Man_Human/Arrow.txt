Arrow Lyrics
All your love keeps me in chains
Just like the river I come back again
All your fear keeps me right here
You'll be the arrow, the arrow

Time's up, I'm roll run
The fire's out, the stars are burning
Don't speak, say something my love
The walls are cracked, our hearts are falling
God knows how I didn't see this coming
Can you hear the sound of skies crying?
My love, my love

All your love keeps me in chains
Just like the river I come back again
All your fear keeps me right here
You'll be the arrow, the arrow

All your love keeps me in chains
Just like the river I come back again
All your fear keeps me right here
You'll be the arrow, the arrow
The winds change
This love was begging
To feel the same
But you gave me nothing
I'm here again
The sky is crying above, above
If you told me then
What I know now
I'd be long gone, but I'm here somehow
Can you hear the sound?
The sky fell down on us, on us

All your love keeps me in chains
Just like the river I come back again
All your fear keeps me right here
You'll be the arrow, the arrow

So the story goes
We weren't high enough, high enough
Don't you need this no more?
Are you strong enough, strong enough
To lose it, to fool yourself?
So hard to understand
Guess I didn't wanna change
This hold on me, this hold on me
All your love keeps me in chains
Just like the river I come back again
All your fear keeps me right here
You'll be the arrow, the arrow

All your love keeps me in chains
Just like the river I come back again
All your fear keeps me right here
You'll be the arrow, the arrow5Embed
