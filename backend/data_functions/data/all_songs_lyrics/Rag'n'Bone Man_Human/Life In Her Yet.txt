Life In Her Yet Lyrics
Ooh...

She still remembers a time that was uncomplicated
But sure as the sun rise she's seen things that you'll never see
Losses and heartache amount to her strength
But oh, how they both take their toll

She's still here fighting
Better know there's life in her yet

Time will take us all, and turn us into stones
It leaves us with regrets and picks apart the threads
Hung over fragile bones

Let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go

Her hands tell the story of hardships that we'll never know
Her face is a map of a lifetime on well traveled roads
But those eyes tell nothing of a soul that is spared
A heart that is longing for death
She's still here fighting
Better know there's life in her yet

Time will take us all, and turn us into stones
It leaves us with regret, it picks apart the threads
Hung over fragile bones

Let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go
Let her go
I can't let her go
I can't let her go

Let her go
Let her go
Let her go2Embed
