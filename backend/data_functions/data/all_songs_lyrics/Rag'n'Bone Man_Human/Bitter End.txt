Bitter End Lyrics
You swear to god but I'm a non-believer
And you're losing faith while I've been holding on
Trying to find the root of all that's come between us
Trying to save what's left before everything is gone

Sweet love, my oldest friend
Have we come to the bitter end?
No make up, no pretend
Have we come to the bitter end?
The bitter end (Oh-oh-oh)
The bitter end (Oh-oh-oh)

Too many years of battle scars, and now we're broken
And all the words you said been hanging over my head for time
And all of the lines we've crossed, they've finally bust us open
As a thousand tiny paper cuts align

Sweet love, my oldest friend
Have we come to the bitter end?
No make up, no pretend
Have we come to the bitter end?
The bitter end (Oh-oh-oh)
The bitter end (Oh-oh-oh)
Have we come to (Oh-oh-oh) the bitter end?
Oh, the bitter end (Oh-oh-oh)
The higher we rise, the further we fall
When we crash down
Through all of these years
I can't accept it's over now
I won't let go

Sweet love, my oldest friend
Have we come to the bitter end?
No make up, no pretend
Have we come to the bitter end?1Embed
