Be the Man Lyrics
We're bound by this
Running circles and we're walking in reverse
It's hard to change a love like this
The writings on the wall, so strong it hurts

I've been holding back my love
For reasons I can not define
I'm still the man you want
It's just hard to tell you so

We're going through changes, changes, changes, yeah
With hard times I'm sure are ahead
You gotta have faith in, faith in, faith in me (Faith in me)
'Til I can be the man I said I'd be
'Til I can be the man
'Til I can be the man

We're bound by this
And I don't have to say a word to you
I guess that's how freedom feels
Knowing that its just us in a crowded room
But I've been holding back on love
For reasons I can not define
I'm still that man you want
It's just hard to tell you sometimes

We're going through changes, changes, changes, yeah (Changes)
With hard times I'm sure are ahead
(We'll make it through I'm sure of it)
You gotta have faith in, faith in, faith in me (Faith in me)
'Til I can be the man I said I'd be
'Til I can be the man
'Til I can be the man
'Til I can be the man
'Til I can be the man

We're going through changes, changes, changes, yeah (Changes)
With hard times I'm sure are ahead
(We'll make it through I'm sure of it)
You gotta have faith in, faith in, faith in me (Faith in me)
'Til I can be the man I said I'd be
'Til I can be the manEmbed
