Odetta Lyrics
You were always trying to fill the void my brother
Habits old, tryna find that something new
Never still in the arms of a lover
Seeking darkness wherever light may shine through

Along came the morning of another
Blindsided by a sweet surprise

Odetta, don't you know
That you saved this young man's soul?
And he can watch you getting wise
And you go watch him growing old

You always searching for destruction
Now you bear the scars of a path in which you chose
It takes a brave and a stronger kind of woman
To follow where such a broken man can go

Along came the morning of another
Blind sided by your sweet surprise
Odetta, don't you know
That you saved this young man's soul?
He go watch you getting wise
And you go watch him growing old

You got to hold him close
Odetta, don't you ever let him go
Might be a long wild road
Although we may need you then
We need you now more than ever

Odetta, don't you know
That you saved this young man's soul?
He go watch you getting wise
And you go watch him growing old
