Innocent Man Lyrics
I've been a victim of some sorry circumstance
That was committed by somebody else's hand
And only heaven knows how I've ended up so broke
I ain't guilty but I'm left fearing the stand

It's not my crime
Why do I have to pay?
I'm doing time, this feeling I can't shake
I'm lost in the suffering for nothing
My heart don't understand
It's beating for an innocent man

How was I supposed to know that I'd be fooled?
And the sweetest kiss could ever be so cruel
I could always let it go, but it's out of my control
Now I'm right back here still holding on to you

It's not my crime
Why do I have to pay?
I'm doing time, this feeling I can't shake
I'm lost in the suffering for nothing
My heart don't understand
It's beating for an innocent man
Man, man
Man, man

From wanting to needing
You cut me, I'm bleeding
This heart keeps on beating for you

It's not my crime
Why do I have to pay?
I'm doing time, this feeling I can't shake
I'm lost in the suffering for nothing
My heart don't understand

It's not my crime
Why do I have to pay?
I'm doing time, this feeling I can't shake
I'm lost in the suffering for nothing
My heart don't understand
It's beating for an innocent man
