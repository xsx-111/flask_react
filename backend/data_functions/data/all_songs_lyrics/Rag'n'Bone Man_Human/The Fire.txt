The Fire Lyrics
I had a dream, to wash myself
Of this great affliction
So hard to say, I get tongue-tied
Speak without conviction

All the weight of my worries
And the fear that surrounds me
Embeds on you too
I cannot stand here as a man
Place all the blame into your hands
And leave it with you

I've been lost
Lost in the fire of love
I've been lost
Lost, lost in the fire of love

You felt the heat of the sunshine
Before I met you
Now reached inside
Pour your heart out
And left you in the shadows
All the weight of my worries
And the fear that surrounds me
It bears on you too

I've been lost
Lost in the fire of love
I've been lost
Lost, lost in the fire of love

From the days I can face you sober
To the times that I would rage when you would tip me over
We was always on the edge of never-ending
But hands kept on clenching
This last hour's descending
Why you pretending I was pulling down the bricks?
I was young and you were sick
'Cause at the time I drained the life
From everything that ever lived
Man have seen the devil in me
Fire straight from out the pit
But I don't blame myself
Now I see you
I've been lost
Lost in the fire of love
I've been lost
Lost, lost in the fire of love

All that's wrong with me
Is wrong with youEmbed
