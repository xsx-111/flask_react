Healed Lyrics
Must've drank a lot of pain
Judging by the way it aches
I must've sold a lot of secrets
Everyone a heavy weight
Of all the fears that I face
You're the first one I defeated

Everything I know
And everything I don't
You took 'em all and shook 'em to the floor
Now I've laid the ghost
Of what I hate the most
You blew them all away and closed the door

And I'm healed when you love me like
You love me like that
Yeah I'm healed when you love me like
You love me like that

Love has such a bitter taste
When you're lying in its wake
At least I know I've got a reason
Now I'm all that can relate
In a better place
When I know I've broken even
Everything I know
And everything I don't
You took 'em all and shook 'em to the floor
Now I've laid the ghost
Of what I hate the most
You blew them all away and closed the door

And I'm healed when you love me like
You love me like that
Yeah I'm healed when you love me like
You love me like that

Nobody knows like my baby knows
Nobody goes like my baby goes
Nobody knows like my baby knows
Nobody, nobody

And I'm healed when you love me like
You love me like that
Yeah I'm healed when you love me like
You love me like that
And I'm healed when you love me like
You love me like that
Yeah I'm healed when you love me like
You love me like thatEmbed
