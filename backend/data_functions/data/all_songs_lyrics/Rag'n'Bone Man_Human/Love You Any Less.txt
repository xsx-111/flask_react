Love You Any Less Lyrics
Sunlight is too much for you to bear
It's high time that you came up for air
Don't hide a single thing behind your perfect skin
Don't keep your secrets in a prayer

There is nothing you can say or do
I won't cut you loose, no
So break the silence
And know that we can brave it all

If you're hoping we'll be home
Don't be afraid to ask for help
It won't make me love you any less
It won't make me love you any less
Don't hide behind me
You're strong enough to face the fall
It won't make me love you any less

No shame, no hurt, nothing to lose
My love my heart don't need to prove

And there's nothing you can say or do
There's no one that can change my mind
It's not a weakness, we all have our crosses to bear
If you're hoping we'll be home
Don't be afraid to ask for help
It won't make me love you any less
It won't make me love you any less
Don't hide behind me
You're strong enough to face the fall
Woah, it won't make me love you any less

Time to come in from the cold
Time to let the truth be told
It won't make me love you any less

If you're hoping we'll be home
Don't be afraid to ask for help
It won't make me love you any less
It won't make me love you any less
Don't hide behind me
You're strong enough to face the fall
Woah, it won't make me love you any less3Embed
