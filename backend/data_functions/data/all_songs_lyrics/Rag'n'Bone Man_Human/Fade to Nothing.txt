Fade to Nothing Lyrics
Don't you be so foolish
To think that I'll be around
When you make your mind up, yeah
With your feet on solid ground

I could be anyone, anyone
As long as you got every single thing you want
Think you'll be running this show all alone
That's where you got me wrong

How many times can we put ourselves through this war
Like all the lovers that have been here before?
How many times can we watch this fade into nothing?
No nothing, no nothing at all

Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...

Don't ask for my opinion
If you can't face the truth
Everytime I leave myself open
You're lining me up to lose
I could be anyone, anyone
As long as you got every single thing you want
Think you'll be running this show all alone
That's where you got me wrong

How many times can we put ourselves through this war
Like all the lovers that have been here before?
How many times can we watch this fade into nothing?
No nothing, no nothing at all

Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...

Why do we sit and suffer
Through our darkest days?
Each time we play it over
We make the same mistakes
And that's where we got it wrong

How many times can we put ourselves through this war
Like all the lovers that have been here before?
How many times can we watch this fade into nothing?
No nothing, no nothing at all
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...
Ooh ooh...1Embed
