Your Way or the Rope Lyrics
Your way or the rope
Or the rope oh, oh, oh
Your way
Your way or the rope
Or the rope oh, oh, oh

Why do I feel so let down
When this is how it's always been?
May seem like a small thing now
But it's deep under my skin

'Cause when your mind's made up
There's nothing I can do to change it
And do you think your time is worth more than mine?
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting yeah

And it's your way yeah
Your way or the rope
Or the rope oh, oh, oh
It's your way
Your way or the rope
Or the rope oh, oh, oh
Standing where I'm supposed to be
Going nowhere, thanks to you
Oh would it really put you out
To make me feel significant?

'Cause when your mind's made up
There's nothing I can do to change it
And do you think your time is worth more than mine?
I'm still waiting, I'm still waiting yeah

And it's your way yeah
Your way or the rope
Or the rope oh, oh, oh
It's your way
Your way or the rope
Or the rope oh, oh, oh

Don't (no, no, no,  no)
Don't (no, no, no,  no)
Don't
Make me wait
Don't (no, no, no,  no)
Don't (no, no, no,  no)
Don't
Make me wait
Why is it your way yeah
Your way or the rope?
Or the rope oh, oh, oh
Your way
Your way or the rope
Or the rope oh, oh, oh
Why is it your way
Your way or the rope?
Or the rope oh, oh, oh
Your way
Your way or the rope
Or the rope oh, oh, oh

Don't (no, no, no,  no)
Don't (no, no, no,  no)
Don't
Haha, make me wait1Embed
