Information Travels Faster Lyrics
I intentionally wrote it out to be an illegible mess
You wanted me to write you letters, but I'd rather lose your address
And forget that we'd ever met and what did or did not occur
Sitting in the station, it's all a blur

Of dancehall hips, pretentious quips
A boxer's bob and weave

And here's the kicker of this whole shebang: You're in debt and completely fooled
That you can look into the mirror and objectively rank your wounds

Sewing circles are not solely based in trades of cloth
There's spinsters all around here taking notes
Reporting on us

As information travels faster
In the modern age, in the modern age
As our days are crawling by
So slowly
Information travels faster
In the modern age, in the modern age
As our days are crawling by
So slowly
Information travels faster
In the modern age, in the modern age
As our days are crawling by
So slowly
Information travels faster
In the modern age, in the modern age
As our days are crawling by
So slowlyEmbed
