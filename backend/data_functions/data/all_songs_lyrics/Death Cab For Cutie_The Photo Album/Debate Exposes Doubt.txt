Debate Exposes Doubt Lyrics
The workadays were propping the bar
Quietly erasing the week
And I was in a corner booth
Thinking, pretending to read
About the impossibility
Of one to love unconditionally
And the words that we drive into the ground
Their repetition starts to thin their meaning

Then everything got frighteningly still
As they entered and intersected the floor
And I tried to choke my stare
At the perfection that others would kill for
But all of the parts are the same on every face
Few variables change
The differences pale when compared
To the similarities they share

Finally, there is clarity
And there is purpose after all
But every night ends the same, as I'm
Collapsing once more by your side
Finally, there is clarity
This tiny life is making sense
And every drop numbs the both of us
But I, alone, am staggeringEmbed
