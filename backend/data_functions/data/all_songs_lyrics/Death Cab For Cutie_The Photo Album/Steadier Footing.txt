Steadier Footing Lyrics
It's gotten late, and now, I want to be alone
All of our friends were here; they all have gone home
And here I sit, on the front porch
Watching the drunks stumble forth into the night
You gave me a heart attack; I did not see you there
I thought you had disappeared so early, away from here

And this is the chance I never got
To make a move, but we just talk about
The people we've met in the last five years
And will we remember them in ten more?

I let you bum a smoke; you quit this winter past
I've tried twice before, but like this, it just would not lastEmbed
