Blacking Out the Friction Lyrics
I don't mind the weather
I've got scarves and caps and sweaters
I've got long Johns under slacks for blustery days

I think that it's brainless to assume
That making changes to your window's view
Will give a new perspective

And the hardest part is yet to come

I don't mind restrictions
Or if you're blacking out the friction
It's just an escape, it's overrated anyways

The hardest part is yet to come
When you will cross the country aloneEmbed
