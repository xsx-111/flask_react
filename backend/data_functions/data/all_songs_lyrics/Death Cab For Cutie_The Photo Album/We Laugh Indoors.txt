We Laugh Indoors Lyrics
When we laugh indoors
The blissful tones bounce off the walls and fall to the ground
Peel the hardwood back to let them loose
From decades trapped and listen so still
This city is my home, construction noise all day long
And gutter punks are bumming change
So, I breed thicker skin and let my lustrous coat fill in
And I'll never admit

That I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
And I've always fallen fast
With too much trust in the promising
That no one's ever been here
So, you can quell those wet fears
And I want purity
I must have it here right now
But don't you get me started now
Oh, don't you get me started now
Don't you, get me
Don't you, get me


December's chill comes late
The days get darker and we wait
For this direness to pass
There's piles on the floor
Of artifacts from dresser drawers
But I'll help you pack

I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you
I loved you, Guinevere
I loved you, Guinevere, I loved you3Embed
