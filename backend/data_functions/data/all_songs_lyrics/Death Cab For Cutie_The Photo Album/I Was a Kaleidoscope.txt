I Was a Kaleidoscope Lyrics
I put on my overcoat and walked into winter
My teeth chattered rhythms
And they were grouped in twos or threes
Like a Morse code message was sent from me to me
And cars on slippery slopes, they're stuck
People pushing through their mittens as I was beginning
To feel it soaking through my shoes
Getting colder with every step
I took to your apartment, dear

And I was a kaleidoscope
The snow on my lenses distorting the image
Of what was only one of you
And I didn't know which one to address as all your lips moved

And this is when I forget to breathe
And all the things I scripted, they sound unfounded
And it's that look that you're giving me
That tells me exactly what you are thinking
This ain't working anymore

They got their mothers worked into a panic
Sledding down hills into oncoming traffic
Then parents layered clothes until the children couldn't move and then left them outside 'til their noses were blue
And I got left there, too
I put on my overcoat and walked into winter
My teeth chattered rhythms
And they were grouped in twos or threes
Like a Morse code message was sent from me to meEmbed
