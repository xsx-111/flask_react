Coney Island Lyrics
Sitting on a carousel ride
Without any music or light

Everything was closed at Coney Island
And I could not help from smiling

I can hear the Atlantic echo back
Roller coaster screams from summers past

And everything was closed at Coney Island
And I could not help from smiling
Brooklyn will fill the beach eventually
Everyone will go except meEmbed
