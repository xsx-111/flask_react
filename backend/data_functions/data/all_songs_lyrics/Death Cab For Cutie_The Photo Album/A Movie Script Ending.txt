A Movie Script Ending Lyrics
Whenever I come back
The air on Railroad is making the same sounds
And the shop fronts on Holly are dirty words
Asterisks in for the vowels
We peered through the windows
New bottoms on barstools, but the people remain the same
With prices inflating
Inflating
As if saved from the gallows
There's a bellow of buzzers
And people stop working
And they're all so excited, excited

Passing through unconscious states
When I awoke, I was on
The highway, highway
Highway, highway

With your hands on my shoulders
A meaningless movement, a movie script ending
And the patrons are leaving
Leaving
Passing through unconscious states
When I awoke, I was on
The highway, highway
Highway, highway
Highway, highway
Highway, highway

And now, we all know the words were true
In the sappiest songs, yes, yes
I'll put them to bed, but they won't sleep
Just shuffling the sheets to toss and turn
You can't begin to get it back

Passing through unconscious states
When I awoke, I was on
The onset of a later stage
The headlights are beacons on
The highway, highway
Highway, highway
Highway, highway
Highway, highway2Embed
