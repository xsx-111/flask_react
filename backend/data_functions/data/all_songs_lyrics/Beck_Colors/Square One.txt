Square One Lyrics
I’ve been watching the wheels turning
But I’m learning to enjoy the ride on the road to nowhere
I hope we get there soon
’Cause it’s a place we’ve been before
Knocking on purgatory’s door
To find a place in the sun
A chameleon changing colors on demand

‘Cause this is life and it’s alright
Taking detours in your mind
You’ll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
When you lower your expectations
And you’ve run out of patience
It’s all a part of the plan when you’re lost in the world
And you’re going down hard for the girl

I’ve been running the lights in the city
Saying "Who can I be running from?"
My demons told my skeletons, "He won’t get very far"
And when I got to the dark side of the moon
All the trouble I thought I knew
It left me out in the cold
Spinning out of control on a broken carousel
Now tell me this is life and it’s alright
Chasing windmills in your mind
You’ll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
On the road to tomorrow
Gonna have to beg, steal, or borrow
It’s all a part of the plan when you’re dead to the world
And you’re going down hard for the girl

For the girl
For the girl
For the girl
For the girl
See you on the other side of love all alone
For the girl
Sooner or later at the end of the world
For the girl
See you on the other side of love all alone
For the girl
Sooner or later at the end of the world

‘Cause this is life and it’s alright
Taking detours in your mind
You’ll be fine if you try
To keep your eyes on the consolation prize
On the road to Valhalla
Karma riding shotgun with drama
It’s all a part of the plan when you’re lost in the world
And you’re going down hard for the girl1Embed
