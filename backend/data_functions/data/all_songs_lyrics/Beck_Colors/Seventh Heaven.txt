Seventh Heaven Lyrics
I want to see you with the pharaoh's curse
The apple flower doggerel, the batteries burst
And I'm out in the city in the typical noise
With the suntan ellipse and the filigree of energy
What you want and what you need
Now I'm down on my knees with a pocket full of widows
You can do it down here what you never did there
When you feel untethered from the broken veneer

Don't tell nobody I'm here
Don't tell nobody I'm here

Now I'm far from the world
In your seventh heaven
Now I'm far from the world
In your seventh heaven
Now you gotta let me know
Now you gotta let me know
Now you gotta let me know
Oh you gotta let me know

I'm gonna take it with me
I'm gonna take it with me
I'm gonna take it with me
I'm gonna take it down
Take it down with me
A second language, a burden of hope
I've seen it all come clean like a guillotine rose
A photograph, a low life laugh
We'll shoot for the empire, land in the dust pile
I want to wake up in the shadow of a fever pitch
With the gold glass heart sending messages
I hear the voice over the phone
She pauses, says "They'll never, never, never go"

Oh can I stay here with you?
Oh can I stay here with you?

Now I'm dead to the world
In your seventh heaven
Now I'm dead to the world
In your seventh heaven
Now you gotta let me know
Now you gotta let me know
Now you gotta let me know
Oh you gotta let me know

I'm gonna take it with me
Someday there might be something better
You can change your mind but you can’t forget her
Someday there might be something better
You can change your mind but you can’t forget her
So let it rise to the highest high
In the satellite sky
So let it rise to the highest high
In the satellite sky
Up to the seventh heaven
Seventh heaven
So let it rise, rise, rise
To the highest height
In the satellite sky

Now I’m starting to fall
From your seventh heaven
Now I’m starting to fall
From your seventh heaven
Now you gotta let me know
Now you gotta let me know
Now you gotta let me know
Oh you got to let me know

Love a love a love a love
Love a love a love a love
Love a love a love a love
Love a love a love a love (Seventh heaven)
Love a love a love a love
Love a love a love a love
