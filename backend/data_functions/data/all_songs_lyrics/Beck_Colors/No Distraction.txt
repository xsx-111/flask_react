No Distraction Lyrics
It’s not the words I want to tell you
It’s not the tension that I feel
It’s not the face that I’m showing you today
That betrays the way, the way I want to feel
What I need
What I need
What I need right now is right here
Right in front of me
What I need
What I need
What I need right now is right here
Only you and me

A million times, a million thoughts
And I really don’t know what I want
But then I see you, now I’m almost lost
And everything that I know went wrong
And if it means that it’s done and I’m a fool
But I want to forget what we’ve been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
Losing our way, sometimes, it’s cruel
No distraction
No distraction
Can I, can I be with you?
No distraction
No distraction
Can I, can I be with you?
They pull you to the left
They pull you the right
Pull you in all directions
They pull you to the left
Pull you the right
Pull you in all directions

It’s not the objects that I hold in my possession
It’s not the worldly things that shine
Sometimes the worst will come and bring us back together
Well, help me out and get me through that night
What I need
What I need
What I need right now
Is all right, right in front of me?
What I need
What I need
What I need right now
Is you – you, only you and me

A million times, a million thoughts
And I really don’t know what I want
But then I see you, now I’m almost lost
In everything that I know went wrong
And if it means that it’s done and I’m a fool
When I want to forget what we’ve been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
Losing our way, sometimes it’s cruel

No distraction
No distraction
Can I, can I be with you?
No distraction
No distraction
Can I, can I be with you?
They pull you to the left
They pull you the right
Pull you in all directions
Pull you to the left
Pull you the right
Pull you in all directions
I’m losing time
I’m losing time
There’s so many ways
To live or love or die
I’m losing time
I’m losing time
I’ve wanted to know
Are you still on the line?
Wasting time trying to prove things
Instead of proving my love
I’m losing, I’m losing my mind
Oh oh oh

A million times, a million thoughts
And now I really don't know what I want
But then I see you, I’m almost lost
In everything that I know went wrong
If it means that it’s done and I’m a fool
Don’t want to forget what we’ve been through
Just to save us both from what we knew
Losing our way, sometimes it’s cruel

No distraction
No distraction
Can I, can I be with you?
No distraction
No distraction
Can I, can I be with you?
They pull you to the left
They pull you the right
They push you in all directions
Pull you to the left
Pull you the right
They push you in all directions2Embed
