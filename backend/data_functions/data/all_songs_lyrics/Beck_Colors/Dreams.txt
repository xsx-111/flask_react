Dreams Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ah, oh, oh

Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your rÃªverie
Time is here, don't go to sleep
Streets are running on the brink
They say that we've got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
'Cause there's trouble on the way
Oh, there's trouble on the way
Oh oh, get a dog and pony for a judgment day

Here we are (oh oh oh)
Running circles, around around around around (oh oh oh)
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's makin' me high, I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Now can these broken wings free me
About a light-year from reality
If you want to fall in a dream
You could put the weight right onto me

Here we are (oh oh oh)
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's makin' me high, I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world

Ahh, stop fucking with my dreams, dreams, yeah
Ahh, stop fucking with my dreams, dreams, yeah
Ahh
Here we are (oh oh oh)
Running circles, around around around around
When nothing's right, just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
She's makin' me high, she's makin' me high
Dreams (dreams, dreams)
D-d-d-dreams (oh oh oh)
All day and all night
I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ah, oh, oh
I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world30Embed
