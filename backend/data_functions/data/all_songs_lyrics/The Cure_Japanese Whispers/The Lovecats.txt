The Lovecats Lyrics
We move like cagey tigers
We couldn't get closer than this
The way we walk, the way we talk
The way we stalk, the way we kiss
We slip through the streets while everyone sleeps
Getting bigger and sleeker, and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know

Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to tea, huh?
We should have each other with cream?
Then curl up in the fire
And sleep for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream
Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We missed you hissed the lovecats
We're so wonderfully, wonderfully
Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you
We should have each other to dinner, huh?
We should have each other with cream?
Then curl up in the fire
Get up for awhile
It's the grooviest thing
It's the perfect dream

Hand in hand is the only way to land
And always the right way round
Not broken in pieces, like hated little meeces
How could we miss someone as dumb as this?

I love you, let's go
Oh, solid gold
How could we miss
Someone as dumb as this?17Embed
