Speak My Language Lyrics
It was only yesterday
Waving arms across the street
Your white face left me blue
How can I say all the things
I have to say to you
Oh all the people here
All look the same
The little time I spend with you
We drink each other dry

Mammnnarghaassstmmetc
Speak my language

It was only yesterday
My eyes touched yours across the street
We cut the words
And waved goodbye
And dropped off the edge of the world

Mammnnarghaassstmmetc
Speak my language
Mammnnarghaassstmmetc
Speak my languageEmbed
