The Dream Lyrics
You're too far away
Too far away to touch
And this mother's love inside me
Hurts too much
Prettily waving
Playing on the sand
Dreaming of everything
Dancing, dancing
In our hands
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing
Dancing, dancing

Dizzy, dizzy, dizzy
As I speak
Like a tumbling cat
I watch in fascination
Like a vampire bat
Don't do it, don't do it
Don't do it, don't do it
Don't give it away (Give it away)
We'll use it up tomorrow
If we don't use it today
If we don't use it today
If we don't use it today
If we don't use it today
If we don't use it today
Rest your head
Oh, just put it outside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night
The dream
The time love died
The night
The dream
The time our love died

We pushed it in our mouths
Pushed it deep inside
All wrapped up in ribbons
The night
The dream
The time love died
The night
The dream
The time our love died2Embed
