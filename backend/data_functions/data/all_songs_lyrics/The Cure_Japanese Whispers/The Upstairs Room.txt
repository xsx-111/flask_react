The Upstairs Room Lyrics
I love it, all these games we play
I close my eyes, you run away
I'm sure I asked you to stay
But now you're gone
Today I feel a grey pulse in my head
I turn off the lights and crawl into bed
I try to think of sunshine
But my body goes wet
With the first crash of thunder

I don't think I could love
Anyone but you
That's for sure

And when it gets to Fall
It's my turn to go
Oh, the kiss, so alcoholic and slow
Arranged a meet for Saturday
I thought you would know
That I always sleep alone

I don't think I could love
Anyone but you, dear
That's for sure
That's for sure
That's for sure
That's for sure
The upstairs room is cool and bright
We could go up there in Summer
And dance all night
Your sister started talking at a minute after ten
'Til everyone jumped up
And then fell over again
In April you can join them
And stare at me
At the ghost from your past
At the ghost from your past
At the ghost from your past
At the ghost from your past

I don't think I could love
Anyone but you, dear
That's for sure
That's for sure5Embed
