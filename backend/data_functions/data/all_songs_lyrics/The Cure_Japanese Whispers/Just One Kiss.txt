Just One Kiss Lyrics
Remember the time that you reigned all night?
The Queen of Siam in my arms
Remember the time that the islands sank?
But nobody opened their eyes

Remember that time that the trees fell down?
The wood crashing through the wall
Remember the sound that could wake the dead?
But nobody woke up at all

Somebody died for this
Somebody died
For just one kiss
Just one kiss

Remember the time that the sky went black?
We waited alone on the sands
Remember the taste of the raging sea?
But nobody held out their hands

Somebody died for this
Somebody died
For just one kiss
Just one kiss
Just one kiss
Just one...
