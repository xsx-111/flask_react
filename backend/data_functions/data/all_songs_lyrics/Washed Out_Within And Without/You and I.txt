You and I LyricsHolding soft, to holding back, to keep his own heart
All in all, you need to learn to let it go
Feelings for her
For all you know
You keep yourself from rising tone, no future holds
Slowly look up, you're looking hard to find love
Low key, fatal tune
Hold me, you know this wasn't planned
Hold me close, you'll hold
Hold me now, to keep it all in sand
Hold fire, you'll hold
Under unnatural circumstances, I forget about your vain pretenses
But if you want to recreate the sea, another sky for me, I got you
Under unnatural circumstances, I forget all of your vain pretenses
But if you want to recreate for me, another sky and see, I got you
(Personify)
So hold me, you know this wasn't planned
Hold me close, you'll hold
Hold me now, to keep it all in sand
So hold fire, you'll hold2Embed
