Far Away Lyrics
You said hello
When you passed me by
You said your heart was lost
You left your world exposed, long gone
You left your voice inside

And now far away
She's got it
And now far away
She's far
And now all the thoughts, forgotten
And now all the hope is gone

You said no words as you walked on past
You said you were alright
You left your world exposed, long gone
You left your voice inside

And now far away
She's got it
And now far away
She's far
And now all the thoughts, forgotten
And now all the hope is goneEmbed
