Eyes Be Closed LyricsInside your voice resounds
Your thoughts realign
Your words feel cold tonight
Your short sweet life
Hear voices all in time
Hear the words calling back
Feel the wave form now, ride the foam
See the world clearly now
Rising up you float outside yourself
Find the source of light
You fly home, you go closer now
Rising towards the light2Embed
