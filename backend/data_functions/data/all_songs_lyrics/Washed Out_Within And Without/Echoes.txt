Echoes LyricsYou can't reach out
Your world weighs down
You toll, they ran
Reverse, the day goes by
You fight to hide
Your world withdraws
You toll, we pass
Reverse, the day goes by
Folding back, you stand to try
Falling from the night
So your light is bright now
Fortunes are too slight
Folding back, you stand to try
Falling from the night
So your light is bright now
Fortunes are too slight1Embed
