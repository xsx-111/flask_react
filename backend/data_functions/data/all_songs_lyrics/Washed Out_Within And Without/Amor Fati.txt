Amor Fati Lyrics
Don't try to find words now, you'll fall
Let go, reach out
The choice is yours to find

Inside you've got the light to guide
Your fate decides the roads you're going to find

Relax, slow down
Let hope decide
Even though he's hard to forgive
But you can't help fall in love
If you know your flaws, you know that
You'll be all right in time

Inside you've got the light to guide
Your fate decides the roads you're going to find

Inside you've got the light to guide
Your fate decides the roads you're going to find6Embed
