Soft LyricsInside
You know
It's not your fault
There comes a time
For all we've got inside
Free forming now
The soul's sweet guide to light

Hear you call out
Before sweet time
Through the sunbeams, you cry
All you've wanted will work out fine
The world is soft
In time
You know
You've got it all

Hear you call out
Before sweet time
Through the sunbeams, you cry
All you've wanted will work out fine
The world is soft3Embed
