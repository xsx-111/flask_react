A Dedication LyricsI forgot wolves run
Between, half the time I'm so dead
It's okay - this'll help, inside
I won't fall behind
I won't forget all that I've done
Don't be scared it's over now, I swear
Try to push it back
Try to keep from missing love
It's okay - this'll help, inside
I won't fall behind
I won't forget all that I've done
Don't be scared
It's fine
It's okay, it's over now5Embed
