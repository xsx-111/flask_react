Weightless LyricsCome close, lay next to me
Come close, lay next to me
I need to tell you something important
So stay close, remain next to me
I need to feel important
Because it's your eyes I don't believe
And my heart, you will, you will mislead
Do you know the consequence that comes with having such confidence?
Holding all the weight in my life
Then you turn and walk away from me
So what is this now, you ask of me?
What's makes your pain such an urgency?
Now I want out, so plain to see
Once again my dear, a brand new tragedy
Holding all the weight in my life
Then you turn and you walk away from me
Holding all the weight in my life
Then you turn and you walk away from me
Bleeding all the strength from my life
Then you turn and you run away from me
Youâ€™re bleeding all the strength from my life
Then you turn and you run away from meEmbed
