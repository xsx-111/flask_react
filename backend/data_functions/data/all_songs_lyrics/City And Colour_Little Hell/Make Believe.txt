Make Believe LyricsI was raised in Catholic school
Taught to obey that one golden rule
That is he who sits in the heaven above
Deserves all your praise, devotion and your love
Because he had a son who had died for our sins
And with that sacrifice came a sense of contrition
That we all seem to feel
When we're down on our knees
Looking up to God
Hoping he'll answer all our needs
But I tend to believe that it's all for naught
And when the sun does set
All our souls will rot
Along with our flesh and our bones
And our blood
Will seep into the earth
Reconnecting with the mud
And I think to myself
"What a beautiful lie,"
To waste being devout
To what could all turn out to be a lie
To be a lie
Now I do not know
But I have been told
If you don't believe in Him
Well, then the devil owns your soul
But let us just examine what's below this land
It's the story of a man
With a pitchfork in his hand
Could you honestly believe
In such a tall, tall tale
Something that sounds so make believe
Just like the sailor and the wind
Well, I guess that this song
Has sealed my own fate
Lucifer won't take me
Ain't crossing through no pearly gates
But if either one exists
Well, that's fine by me
I will gladly spend the afterlife
Waiting in purgatory
Purgatory...Embed
