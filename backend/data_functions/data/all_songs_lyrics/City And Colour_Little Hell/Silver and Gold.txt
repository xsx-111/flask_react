Silver and Gold LyricsLast night I dreamt that they dropped a bomb
Oh the sea ran dry and the winds had calmed
The skyscrapers fell, and crumbled to dust
Their skeletons of steel were covered in rust
And everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
Oh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
Colours were drained straight from the sky
And nothing living had survived
The mountains were merely removed from the earth
And silver and gold had lost all its worth
And everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
Oh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
I woke from the dream in a cold, cold sweat
I was full of doubt and deep regret
For suddenly it was so clear to me;
There was nothing left in which to believe
And everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared
Oh everything I loved and feared had all at once disappeared1Embed
