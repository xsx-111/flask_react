Sorrowing Man Lyrics
Sorrowing man, look how worn you've become
You once were Lord of the barren sea
There's blood on our hands, in this perfect madness
You're living on borrowed time
Oh how you have lost your way
Oh how you have lost your way
There's no sympathy for we don't know the cure
Cause what you've got, well it runs too pure
But you've lived and breathed more than any man I know
But you're not done, oh, at least, I hope
Oh how you have lost your way
Oh how you have lost your way
In this life that we have made together
Oh how you have lost your way
Oh how you have lost your way
Oh how you have lost your way1Embed
