Fragile Bird Lyrics
When she sleeps
There is a fever dream, yeah
It brings a night terror
To harm this fragile bird
She speaks in tongues
Her words they come undone, yeah
And with a wayward mind
She struggles through the night

All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
Through the night
Through the night
These cold nightmares
They make her worse for wear
Lost in the dark
She's got a heavy heart

And when she wakes
In her fragile state
Well, she calls my name
Hoping that I keep her safe

All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
All the I can do
Is hope she makes it through
Through the night
Through the night
Through the night
Through the night
All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
All that I can do
Is hope she makes it through
Through the night2Embed
