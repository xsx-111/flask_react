Natural Disaster LyricsCan you imagine all the homes abandoned and all alone?
With no one left to care for them, wilting in moss
The paint is peeling off the walls
The corners are filled up with dust
Cigarette smoke hangs in the air
And the grass ain't growing like it did long ago
Whether a natural disaster ripped it from its foundation
Or an economic tragedy tore apart its family
They're all empty
The pipes have long since seized
The windows are all boarded up
There's no electricity flowing through these lifeless veins
Cracks are running down the walls
Where picture frames used to hang
A hint of heartbreak still lingers in the air
And weeds have choked the breath out of it long ago
Whether a natural disaster ripped it from its foundation
Or an economic tragedy tore apart its family
They're all empty
They're all emptyEmbed
