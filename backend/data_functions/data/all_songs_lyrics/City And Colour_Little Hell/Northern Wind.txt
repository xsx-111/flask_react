Northern Wind Lyrics
You're the Northern Wind
Sending shivers down my spine
You're like fallen leaves
In an autumn night
You're the lullaby
That's singing me to sleep
You are the other half
You're like a missing piece

Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
You don't know
What you do to me
You are all four seasons
Rolled into one
You're like the cold December snow
In the warm July sun
I'm the jet black sky
That's just before the rain
Like the mighty current
Pullin' you under the waves
Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
You don't know
What you do to me
I'm the darkest hour
Just before the dawn
And I'm slowly sinking
Into the slough of despond
Like an old guitar
Worn out and left behind
I have stories left to tell
They're of the healing kind
Oh my love
Oh my love
Oh my love
If I could just
Find you tonight
If I could just find you tonight
Oh my love
Do do do 11Embed
