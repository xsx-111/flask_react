We Found Each Other in the Dark LyricsI heard the church bells from afar
But we found each other in the dark
And when the smoke does finally pass
We will rise above all the ash
Cause we're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
We're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
We're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
At last
So bright, the flames burned in our hearts
That we found each other in the dark
Black beast, out in the wilderness
We are fighting to survive and convalesce
But we're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
We're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
We're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live
Like the rest
Through the black soulless water
And the cold lonely air
On the rock restless seas
The vessel in deep disrepair
And the swans they started singing
But then oh, rejoice!
I can still hear your voice
Then I heard the church bells from afar
But we found each other in the darkEmbed
