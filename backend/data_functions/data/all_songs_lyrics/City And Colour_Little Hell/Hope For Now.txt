Hope For Now LyricsThis highway's dark and empty
Just miles and miles of endless road
I've got a sickness pounding in my head
I'm at the mercy of the ghost
What will it take to live as if I would not another day?
To live without despair, and to be without disdain
How can I instill such hope, but be left with none of my own?
What if I could sing just one song and it might save somebody's life?
I sought after, after reasons to stay
I was lost, I was lost
Then the sky turned black
And the rains poured down
I was waiting, waiting to be found. oh, no
How can I instill such hope, but be left with none of my own?
What if I could sing just one song and it might save somebody's life?
Then I would sing all that I could sing
Cause that is when, when I feel that I'm not just counting time
Oh when I sing all that I can sing
Maybe just for a moment things would seem all right
Oh when I sing, oh when I sing
Oh when I sing, oh when I sing2Embed
