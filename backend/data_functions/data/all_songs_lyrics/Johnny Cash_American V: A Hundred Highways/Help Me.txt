Help Me Lyrics
Oh, lord, help me walk
Another mile, just one more mile;
I'm tired of walking all alone
And lord, help me to smile
Another smile, just one more smile;
Don't think I can do things on my own

I never thought I needed help before;
Thought that I could get by - by myself
But now I know I just can't take it any more
And with a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm begging You please for help

Oh come down from Your golden throne to me, to lowly me;
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand
Release the chains of darkness
Let me see, Lord let me see;
Just where I fit into your master plan


With a humble heart, on bended knee
I'm begging You please for helpEmbed
