Rose of My Heart Lyrics
We're the best partners this world's ever seen
Together as close as can be
But sometimes it's hard to find time in between
To tell you what you mean to me

You are the rose of my heart
You are the love of my life
A flower not fading nor falling apart
If you're tired, rest your head on my arm
Rose of my heart

When sorrow holds you in its arms of clay
It's rain drops that fall from your eyes
Your smile is like the sun come to earth for a day
You brighten my blackest of skies


So hard times or easy times, what do I care
There's nothing I'd change if I could
The tears and the laughter are things that we share
Your hand in mine makes it good
