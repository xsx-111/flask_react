Nancy From Now On Lyrics
Oh, pour me another drink
And punch me in the face
You can call me Nancy
Every man wears a symbol
And I know I have mine
I've got my right hand stamped
In the concentration camp
Where my organs scream
"Slow down, man!"

Ooh, how was I to know
Milk and honey flowed
Just a couple states below?
Ooh

Oh, hook me up to the tank
And roll me to the door
I'm going where my body leads me
I can fend for myself
With what looks I have left
I'll put away a few
And pretty soon I'll be breaking things like Howard Hughes
Ooh, how was I to know
Milk and honey flowed
Just a couple states below?

Ooh, give me how it was
Our place under the sun
Before the devil made me run
"Run, boy"
"Run, boy"
