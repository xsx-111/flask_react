Everyman Needs a Companion Lyrics
Every man needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Every man needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

John the Baptist took Jesus Christ
Down to the river on a Friday night
They talked about Mary like a couple of boys
With nothing to lose
Too scared to try

Every man needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Every man needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

Joseph Campbell and The Rolling Stones
Couldn't give me a myth
So I had to write my own
I got hung up on religion
Though I know it's a waste
I never liked the name "Joshua"
And I got tired of "J."
Every man needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need youEmbed
