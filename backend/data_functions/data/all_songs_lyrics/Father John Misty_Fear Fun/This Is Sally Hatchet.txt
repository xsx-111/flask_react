This Is Sally Hatchet Lyrics
Ooh, ooh

Born the daughter of a comedian
Middle of the eighties
Someone turn that awful mouth-breathing down, or else
Sally Hatchet lives in a hole in the ground
The longer it keeps raining, the more she has to struggle
To maintain a wonderful time, oh, yeah

Go on and laugh it up without me
I've got smoke in my lungs
And a past life in the trunk, oh
Ooh, ooh

Pretty rattled by the way that she
Empties a few clips out
Do I have a choice now?
Point that thing away from me, lady, oh4Embed
