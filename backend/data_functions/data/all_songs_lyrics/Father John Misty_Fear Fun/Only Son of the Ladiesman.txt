Only Son of the Ladiesman Lyrics
When I heard the Ladies' Man was dead
I saw the rolling stone stop moving
Saw my ancient hero on the Sunset Strip
He left behind a legacy of ruin
Now painted ladies want to hold my gun
Wonder if the whole time I'd been acting
When I sang "Moon River" in that silent film
Had I really made a sound when they called "Action"?

I swear that man was womankind's first husband
They all died in a line to save him
I'm a steady hand, I'm a Dodgers fan
I'm a leading brand, I'm a one-night stand
I'm a ladies' man

Ooh, only son of the Ladies' Man
Ooh, only son of the Ladies' Man

Couldn't see his used up body at the funeral
By virtue of the flailing of his conquests
They tied down his casket with a garter belt
Each troubled heart was beating in a sequined dress
Someone must console these lonesome daughters
No written word or ballad will appease them
The cowboy and the cop shot down the Ladies' Man
The humid nights in LA are now silent
I swear that man was womankind's first husband
(Ooh) Only son of the Ladies' Man
(Ooh) Only son of the Ladies' Man
(Ooh) Only son of the Ladies' Man
(Ooh)6Embed
