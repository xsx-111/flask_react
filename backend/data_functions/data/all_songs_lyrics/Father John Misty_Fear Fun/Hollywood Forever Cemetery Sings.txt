Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings Lyrics
Jesus Christ, girl
What are people going to think?
When I show up to one of several funerals
I've attended for Grandpa this week
With you with me
But someone's got to help me dig
Someone's got to help me dig

Jesus Christ, girl
It hasn't been long so it seems
Since I was picking out an island and a tomb for you
At the Hollywood Cemetery
You kiss on me
But we should let this dead guy sleep
We should let this dead guy sleep

Jesus Christ, girl
I laid up for hours in a daze
Retracing the expanse of your American back
With Adderall and weed in my veins
You came, I think?
Because the marble made my cheeks look pink
But I'm unsure of so many things
Someone's got to help me dig
Someone's got to help me dig
Someone's got to help me dig12Embed
