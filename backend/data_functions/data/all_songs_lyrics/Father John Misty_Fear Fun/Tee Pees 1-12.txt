Tee Pees 1-12 Lyrics
Well, you took me to the movies, you took me to the dance
You took me to your warehouse tied up in the back of your van
You said, "whip it out," and I started to shout
"I'm in love with a woman again!"
Well, you took me to your office, we went to meet your folks
We went out to the garden shed where you took off all my clothes
And I was terrified by the look in your eyes
But there's a lot to loving I don't know
Well, you took me to the ceremony to sweat out all my fear
Came across a cosmic serpent with hands woven into his hair
If he's my spirit guide, I'm gonna stay inside
I'm never sleeping in a teepee again

No no, no no no no no!

Well, you asked me where I came from in the middle of round ten
I thanked you for the compliment before you clarified what you meant
You said, "What the hell are you doing here?
There's a prowler in my apartment"
Trout Fishing in America made me go and buy a pole
But by the time I got around to reading the book
I was a celebrated deep sea pro
Was drinking greyhounds way below the ground
On my very own TV show
Well, we went to get some work done, so our faces finally matched
The doctor took one look at me and took a skin graft out of my ass
If this is what it takes to take you on a date
I'm gonna put my member behind glass
If I make it out alive of Hollywood and Vine
I'll build a cabin up in the Northwest
No no, no no no no no!
