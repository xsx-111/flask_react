Worried Life Blues LyricsOh lordy lord, oh lordy lord
It hurts me so bad for us to part
But someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
So many nights since you've been gone
I've had to worry and grieve my life alone
But someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
So many days since you went away
I've had to worry both night and day
But someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
You're on my mind every place I go
How much I love you, nobody know
Yeah, someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
So that's my story, this is all I've got to say to you
Goodbye, baby, I don't care what you do
But someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Oh lordy lord, oh lordy lord
It hurts me so bad for us to part
But someday, baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymoreEmbed
