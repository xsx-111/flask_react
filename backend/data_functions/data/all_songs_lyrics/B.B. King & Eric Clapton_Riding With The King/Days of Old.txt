Days of Old LyricsWay back yonder in the days of old
The men was workin', but not savin' any dough
Then came a woman lookin' real cool
She said to herself "Now, that's my fool"
I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well you can't break the rule
Because every man is some woman's fool
Met a girl on the avenue
She was shy and I was blue
Like a teacher and a student at school
Looked at me and said "You're my fool"
Gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
Man I can't break a rule
'Cause every man is some woman's fool
Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was workin', but not savin' any dough
Then came a woman lookin' real cool
She said to herself "Now, that's my fool"
I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well you can't break the rule
Because every man is some woman's fool
I'm gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
Well I can't break the rule
Because every man is some woman's foolEmbed
