When My Heart Beats Like a Hammer LyricsWhen my heart starts beating like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
Oh, when my heart starts beating like a hammer
And my eyes get full of tears
You know you've only been gone 24 hours, baby
Oh, but it seems like, it seems like a million years
Now if I ever mistreated you, baby
You know I didn't mean no harm
Oh, if I ever mistreated you, baby
God knows I didn't mean no harm
You know I'm just a little country boy, baby
And I was raised right down on the cotton farm
Oh, you give me so much trouble, baby
Babe, that I don't know what to do
Oh, you give me so much trouble, baby
Baby, I don't know, I don't know what to do
Oh, I ain't got nothing, I ain't got nothing now, baby
Babe, and it's all on, it's all on account of youEmbed
