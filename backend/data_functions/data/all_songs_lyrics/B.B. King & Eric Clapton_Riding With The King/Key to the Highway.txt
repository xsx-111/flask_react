Key to the Highway LyricsI've got the key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
Gonna leave here running
Walking is most too slow
I'm going back to the border
Baby, where I'm better known
Because you haven't done nothing, baby
But drove a good man from home
When the moon peeks over the mountain
Little girl, I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roam this highway
Until the break of day
Oh give me one more kiss, darlin'
Just before I go
'Cause when I leave this time, little girl
I won't be back no more
I got the key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here running
Walking is most too slowEmbed
