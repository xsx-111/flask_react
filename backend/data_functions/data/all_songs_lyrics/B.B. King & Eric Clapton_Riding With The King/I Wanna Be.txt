I Wanna Be LyricsI wander helplessly day by day
It's so much easier to run away
My mind is telling my body so
Never knowing which way to go
I'm always there for you, baby
You let me see if we can get closer everyday
I wanna be held by you
I wanna be touched by you
I wanna be, I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be anything you want me to
Don't mean nothing when you're growing old
Nobody knows what the future holds
I am left with a bitter taste
Turn away from that beautiful chase
But I'm always there for you, baby
You let me see if we can get closer everyday
I wanna be, I wanna be held by you
I wanna be touched by you
I wanna be, I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be, wanna be anything you want me to be
I wanna be held by you
I wanna be touched by you
I wanna be, I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be anything you want me to be
I wanna be held by you
I wanna be touched by you
I wanna be, I wanna be loved by you
I wanna be anything you want me to beEmbed
