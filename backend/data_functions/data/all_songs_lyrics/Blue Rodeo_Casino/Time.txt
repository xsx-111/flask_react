Time Lyrics
An endless chain of days go by
Can't scratch the surface still I try
I'm going down feeling underground
Just kicking the leaves all around this town
Can't catch the beat I'm feeling ill
Too much time to kill

Time, time, time
Time to kill

Follow the footsteps down the stairs
Painted doorways dirty rails
Take a ride on the evening blue
Gonna check out the crowds on Mott Avenue
Gonna watch the waves on Jamaica Bay
Far rock away

Time, time, time
Time to kill
Time, time, time
Time to kill
