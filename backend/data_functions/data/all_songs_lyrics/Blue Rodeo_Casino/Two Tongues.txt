Two Tongues Lyrics
If you have the Midas touch
Why does everything around here look like rust?
And if your house is in such perfect order
Why are your kids running around in rags from second hand counters?

Yeah, tell me why
Yeah, you tell me why
Is it because you got two tongues in one head?

You can change your words in mid-direction
You're a freaked out flathead hollow-eyed bad hallucination
Useless prayers from obedient lips
Life's too good in the house of the privileged

Well, tell me why
Yeah, you tell me why
Is it because you got two tongues in one head?


Well, tell me why
Yeah, you tell me why
Is it because you got two tongues in one head?
Is it because you got two tongues in one head?
Well, tell me why
Yeah, you tell me why
Is it because you got two tongues in one head
Is it because you got two tongues in one headEmbed
