What Am I Doing Here Lyrics
On this useless night
With you so far away
I stand in front of this ferris wheel

And I wonder what am I doing here
And I wonder what am I doing here

And all the drunks just stumble by
And mumble their abuse
Tell me what is the use

And I wonder what am I doing here
And I wonder what am I doing here

After so long nobody's wrong
After so long nobody's right
After so long nobody's wrong
After so long nobody's right

On this useless night
With you so far away
I stand in front of this ferris wheel
And I wonder what am I doing here
And I wonder what am I doing here
And I wonder what am I doing hereEmbed
