After the Rain Lyrics
Oh, if I had my way, I would never go back
With my back to the wall, just let myself fall
Watch the daytimes turn black
But now and again I find, you cross my mind

Oh, if I was a train, I would never slow down
My head in the sky and the world goin' by every nowhere town
As I write one more letter to you
No, I can't change the things that I do, oh

One day when you discover
Just why I ran, ran away from you, lover
Well, I know I'm to blame, feel so ashamed
Called out your name
Oh, after the rain


Well, what do you want me to do?
I've thrown away everything for you
Well, I've wasted my dreams
Each day it seems
Losing my way back to you
It's time for a change
What else could I do?
With the clock ticking time
Better make up my mind
Is it me or is it you?
Yeah, tonight as I'm losing control
I will drink to the queen of my soul

One day when you discover
Just why I ran, ran away, ran away from you, lover
I know I'm to blame, feel so ashamed
Called out your name
Oh, after the rain
After the rain
After the rain
After the rain
After the rain
After the rain
Oh, after the rain
After the rain
After the rainEmbed
