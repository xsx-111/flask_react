Last Laugh Lyrics
I should have seen through it but you were so intent
The nervous breakdown on an overworked bed
You couldn't wait to get over the edge

You were drunk on the silver
When he took your crown
He took from you everything that wasn't tied down
Well you said he was an angel
With the chains of gold
Too bad they weren't strong enough to hold

The clock of world is just a dream
Still I shouldn't be jealous of the ones who lay flowers at your feet
Yeah my desire has finally put you out of reach

You were drunk on the silver
When he took your crown
He took from you everything that wasn't tied down
Well you said he was an angel
With the chains of gold
Too bad they weren't strong enough to hold
Now all your saviours wait their turn in line
While you sit in the corner
And drink yourself blind
The last laugh has finally been had
But it's not what you think
The last laugh has finally been had
And it don't taste so sweet
Now you're finally on your own
Last thing he said to you was see you around

You were drunk on the silver
You were drunk on the silver
You were drunk on the silver
Now you're going to leave me with the last laughEmbed
