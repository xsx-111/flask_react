5 A.M. (A Love Song) Lyrics
With every breath, we grow further apart
And sometimes I wish we didn't know how to talk
And we sort out the who said? You said, who said? I said
I only wish I came a little better prepared

5 a.m., these things will pass
Tomorrow won't be our last

Funny how I'm always here with you
I never meant to change your world
Or change your point of view
I only want to hold you when I feel a little blue
I hope you know I'll always be there for you

I know by now I should be sound asleep
But my mind won't let me, feels like it's going to explode
And I'll say that you're right if you just say that I'm right
Let's hit the hay and call this case closed

5 a.m., things get so strange
Tomorrow won't be our last
Funny how I'm always here with you
I never meant to change your world
Or change your point of view
I only want to hold you when I feel a little blue
I hope you know I'll always be there for you


Funny how I'm always here with you
I never meant to change your world
Or change your point of view
I only want to hold you when I feel a little blue
I hope you know I'll always be there for youEmbed
