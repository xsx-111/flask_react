Trust Yourself Lyrics
Someday soon and I don't know when
Your little world will come crashing in
Don't think twice, I'll be around
Turn your back, someone's gonna let you down

You know that it's true
Nobody led you on, they left that to you
Now you'll be alone
When the sun comes up
With your tattered little dreams and a broken cup
Then you'll have to trust yourself
And don't believe in any more lies

You waste your time and think too much
Really make a mess of the things you touch
Poor little bird with a broken wing
Better look around now, you know you're losing everything

It's just a game, thought you had it all lined up
But somehow that's changed
Now you'll have to run and not get caught
And you'll have to hide if you like it or not
Then you'll have to trust yourself
And don't believe in any more lies

Someday soon and it won't be long
You'll ring the bell but they'll all be gone
They took your jewels and your statues too
Left you with a pile of things
You never learned how to use
Well here it comes again
You showed us where it all began
Well here's where it ends

And you'll be alone when the sun comes up
Tattered little dreams and a broken cup
Then you'll have to trust yourself
And don't believe in anymore
Trust yourself
And don't believe in any more
Trust yourself
And don't believe in any more lies
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeahEmbed
