Til I Am Myself Again Lyrics
I want to know where my confidence went
One day it all disappeared
And I'm lying in a hotel room miles away
Voices next door in my ear
Well, daytime's a drag, nighttime's worse
Hope that I can get home soon
But the half-finished bottles of inspiration
Lie like ghosts in my room

Well, I wanna go
I know I can't stay
But I don't want to run feeling this way

'Til I am myself
'Til I am myself
'Til I am myself again

There's a seat on the corner I keep every night
Wait 'til the evening begins
I feel like a stranger from another world
But at least I'm living again
There are nights full of anger
Words that are thrown
Tempers that are shattered and thin
But the moments of magic are just too short
They're over before they begin
Well, I know it's time
One big step
I can't go, I'm not ready yet

'Til I am myself
'Til I am myself
'Til I am myself again

I had a dream that my house was on fire
People laughed while it burned
Well, I tried to run but my legs were numb
I had to wait 'til the feeling returned
Well, I don't need a doctor to figure it out
I know what's passing me by
When I look in the mirror
Sometimes I see traces of some other guy

Well, I wanna go
I know I can't stay
I don't want to run feeling this way

'Til I am myself
'Til I am myself
'Til I am myself againEmbed
