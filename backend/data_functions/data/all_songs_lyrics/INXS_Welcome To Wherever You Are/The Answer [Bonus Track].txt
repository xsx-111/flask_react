The Answer  LyricsI am like you are sure of difference
For the reason without treason
Hoping if we fall down you see
All things broken into pieces
All of you take time win free sufferin'
Wait through all love straight to your head
Feel like I am like you are sure of
Difference for the reason without
Treason hoping if we fall down
You say all things broken into
Pieces all of you take time win free
Sufferin' wait through all love all love
Straight to your head feel like I am
Like you are sure of difference for the
Reason without treason hoping
If we fall down you say all things
Broken into pieces all of you
Take time win free sufferin' made into
All love straight to your head feel like
All your life all your life all your life all your life
All your life..Embed
