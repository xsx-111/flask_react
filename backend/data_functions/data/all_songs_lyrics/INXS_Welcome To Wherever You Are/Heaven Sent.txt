Heaven Sent LyricsYour eyes are like deep wells of desire
Once in your arms I'm on fire
You were sent girl so perfectly true
Changing my life
Now I'm a survivor
Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Late at night when the evening fire has died
There's a look in your eye
Seductive images fly
Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you
One day you'll see what angels can see
Dressed in black if she comes back
I think I'll loose my mind
Tuesday she works
In the library uptown
Some useful knowledge
Can always be found
Don't burn the library
Till you've read all the books
Sometimes in life
You get a second look
Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
That's what I call you
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
