Wishing Well LyricsIf you ever want to taste it
Go down to the wishing well
Poison in the well won't make it
Keep yourself as strong as can be
All men I'll take you
Take you down and tell you why
I said woman gonna take you
Take you down a well that's wide
If you ever want to taste it
Go down to the wishing well
Poison in the well won't make it
Keep yourself as strong as can be
Take it to the river
Take it to the world
I say loving heart
Gonna show the way
Gonna show the way
Gonna show the way
Gonna show the way
Gonna show the way
If you ever want to taste it
Go down to the wishing well
Poison in the well won't make it
Keep yourself as strong as can be
All men
Watch ya seeing
Living it all for the life
Say all men what ya seeing
Gonna change your ways
Gonna change your ways
Gonna change your mind
If you ever want to taste it
Go down to the wishing well
Poison in the well won't make it
Keep yourself
As strong as can be
If you ever gonna taste it
Never look right or left look ahead
I'm the healer
You're believing
Gonna carry ya to the end
Gonna carry ya to the end
If you ever want to taste it
Go down to the wishing well
Poison in the well
Won't make it
Gotta keep yourself
As strong as can be
I'm a healer
I'm a healerEmbed
