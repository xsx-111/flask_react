Leave Me Lonely Lyrics
Dangerous love (Ooh)
You're no good for me, darling (Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you turn me away (Ooh)
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me (Ah-ah-ah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby, more

Is it love when so easily you said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried? Mmm
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, and cry and cry?

So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

You're a dangerous love (Ooh)
Maybe you're no good for me, darling (Ah-ah-ah)
Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I'd rather you leave me lonely (Ooh)
Even though it hurts
Ooh, you're a dangerous love, oh, hey
Dangerous love (Ooh)
You're no good for me, darling (Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you turn me away (Ooh)
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me (Ah-ah-ah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby, more

So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

You're a dangerous love (Ooh)
Maybe you're no good for me, darling (Ah-ah-ah)
Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I'd rather you leave, leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
You're a dangerous love, baby

Dangerous love (Ooh)
You're no good for me, darling (Ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you turn me away (Ooh)
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me (Ah-ah-ah)
I get a chill inside (Ooh)
And nothing frightens me, baby, more41Embed
