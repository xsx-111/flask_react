Moonlight Lyrics
The sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing, but we won't be watching tonight
Every look (Every look), every touch (Every touch)
Makes me wanna give you my heart (Ooh)
I be crushin' on you, baby
Stay right where you are, 'cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight

I kiss his fingertips as I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips (Puts his lips) on my neck (On my neck)
Makes me wanna give him my body
I be fallin' for you, baby, and I just can't stop, 'cause

I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
(Baby, I be fallin')
You're my moonlight, moonlight
He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when heâ€™s holding me tight
And he calls me "moonlight" too101Embed
