Suicide Dream 2 LyricsWhat would it mean to live a life that wasn't like this? That's a question
Looked at a picture of my father and I look just like him. That's what I'm asking'
To think about my home and I just feel the sting of a history that's born in the soil
What would it mean to live a life that wasn't like this?
When I was five what was happening in my life?
And who's to pry when I stand and there's no one crying and now I weep
For every time what was happening in my life
And now I know I was happy then, happy just helping my folks survive
But in my sight, my sight, my sight
Say oh, what's happened everyday to feel your grace
Say oh, what's happened everyday to see your pride
Say oh, what's happened everyday that I was insane
When I think about her
You should pay for what you did but I really can't commit to the stairs
And now I'm under stress the love is over, I can not tell. I mean I waited on, I waited on you
And you just had a baby and I see you once again
And whenever I see your baby I know which way to go
And when I think about her, it's like there's just this weight down on my chest and I sit and there's like there's no air, no air, no air
We're wanted everyday and I wait, for snow
Been waiting for you to sow my fate to show (you gotta show me)
And I wasn't in any pain and my plans were foiled
Said whoa whoa air, no air, no air
We're wanted everyday and I wait, for snow
Been waiting for you to sow, my fate to show (you gotta show me)
That I wasn't in any pain and my plans were foiledEmbed
