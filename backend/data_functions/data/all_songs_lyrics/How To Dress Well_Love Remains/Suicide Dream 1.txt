Suicide Dream 1 LyricsSaid I was sleeping in the back of a car that we took, that we took
And I was wondering how I could see my own face
It said in the world in the side I'm on my way back
And I was sleeping in the back of a car that we took, that we took
And now I'm just missing you
Said I was wondering how can the world we know be lost
How many roads left to go on the road
I mean my god why are we both so alone and I was lost
In my little suicide dream
And now I think about you daily, daily
Talked to your sister that girl is crazy, she's crazy
And man I can't believe you got a baby, a baby
But that's a trip that life goes on and on
In my little suicide dreamEmbed
