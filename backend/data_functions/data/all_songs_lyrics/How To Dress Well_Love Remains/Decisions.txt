Decisions LyricsI was on the phone with some cold lady
Who would have my mind
I was in the waking cold
Watch me lose myself, I rest
Who was in the cold with some cold lady?
Please don't run, hey yeah
Who would have my mind
I was in the waking cold
Watch me lose myself, I rest
Girl, I am waiting
Don't forget to check your cell phone
There's no mistaking, yeah
Don't forget about your real homeEmbed
