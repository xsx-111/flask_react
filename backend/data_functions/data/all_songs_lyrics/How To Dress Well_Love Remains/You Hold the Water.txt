You Hold the Water LyricsNever had a heartache, I mean it
I don't wanna be by myself, all alone
Never had a heartache, I mean it
I don't wanna be by myself, all alone
Never was
You came a long way
We held the water
We had it all
So right, so right
They are long-gone
We were long-gone
We had it all
So right, so right
And am I born to die
To lay this body down
And as my trembling spirits fly
Into a world unknown
You came a long way
We held the water
We had it all
So right, so right
They are long-gone
We were long-gone
We had it all
So right, so right1Embed
