Volume LyricsVolume is pleasant (3x)
If you like the source
There is no reason to be discouraged
Don't be discouraged
Just turn the knob to the left
Turn up the volume (3x)
Let's go
Volume (3x)
Turn up the volume
Forget the picture
Turn up the volume
Forget the picture
Turn up the volume (3x)
When girls meet boys
Turn up the volume (3x)
Forget the picture
Turn up the volume
Forget the picture
You can even dance
Don't be succumbed
On a sunday (2x)
When you go out
Don't be discouraged (2x)
Turn up the volume (2x)
Volume is pleasant
Let's dance
Turn up to volume (3x)
Forget the picture
Try to remember
Try it before or after
You can even danceEmbed
