Feast on My Heart LyricsFeast on my heart
Drill a hole in it
I want you to drown me in it
Pick up the scalpel
I want you to do it
I missed the turnoff
This map has too many symbols
Punch a hole in it
I want you to do it
Drown me through my heart
Pull down your eyebrows
Uncross your arms
I didn't choose your sorrow
No need to worry
Feast on my heartEmbed
