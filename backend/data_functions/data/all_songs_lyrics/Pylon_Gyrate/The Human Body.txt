The Human Body LyricsThe human body is a very useful tool
They know how to function
Without going to school
We have our bodies
And we have our lives
We must protect them
Protect them all the time
I can walk-I can run-I can see
I can talk-I can drive-I can steer
I can think-I can even hear
I can lift-I can drop-I can sweep
I can mop-I can think-I can breathe
I can sing-I can eat
I have my safety glasses
I have my safety shoes
I'm putting in my earplugs
Use caution in what you doEmbed
