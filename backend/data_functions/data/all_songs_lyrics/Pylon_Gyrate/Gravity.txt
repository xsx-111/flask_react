Gravity LyricsGravity it has you in its hold
You cannot resist the urge
You cannot motivate your feet
You cannot it pulls and pulls
You cannot resist the urge
You cannot move you cannot dance
You cannot motivate you cannot
Your feet they feel like steel
You cannot feel your heel
You cannot resist the urgeEmbed
