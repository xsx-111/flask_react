Danger Lyrics
Danger
Be careful
Be cautious
I'll get you unaware
Look out
I'll get you

Danger
Be prepared
I'll catch you unaware
Look out
I'll get you
Go for it
Be careful

Danger
Look out
I'll get you unaware
Be careful
Be cautious
Look out then
Danger
Look out
Be cautious
Be careful
Be prepared
I'll get you unaware


Danger
Look out
Be cautious
Be careful
Be prepared
Watch out
