Working Is No Problem LyricsWorking is no problem
Just as long as I keep my mind
Working in a factory
Science is no fun
There must be more than this
I need to make some home improvements
Think I'll call guys that know about it
I get up and go to work tomorrow morning
I'll be clean but not neat
I am not a race car driver
Everything looks the same
I am not an advanced pronoun
I get my lessons in the rain
I am not a race car driver
Everything looks the same
Putting things in boxes
I look at them and pack them
I am not a smart person
But I try to have my funEmbed
