Turn the Light Lyrics
I go out at night and paint the stars
I go out at night and leave my head on the bed
I go out at night and race my heart
I go out at night and leave my head on the bed

Starry, starry night
This is how I wanna live
Gonna lay me down in love
I got so much more to give
Starry, starry night
This is how I wanna live
Gonna lay me down in love
I got so much more to give

Tonight, my love
We'll turn to light tonight
Tonight, my love
We'll turn to light tonight, tonight

I go out at night into the dark
I go out at night and leave my head on the bed
I go out at night to where you are
I go out at night and leave my head on the bed
Starry, starry night
This is how I wanna be
Gonna turn that dial up
And that love will set me free
Starry, starry night
This is how I wanna be
Gonna let my body shine
And that love will set me free

Tonight, my love
We'll turn to light tonight
Tonight, my love
We'll turn to light tonight
Tonight, my love
We'll turn to light tonight
Tonight, my love
We'll turn to light tonight, tonight

Into the light
Your love takes me high
Into the light
Into the light
Your love takes me high
Into the light4Embed
