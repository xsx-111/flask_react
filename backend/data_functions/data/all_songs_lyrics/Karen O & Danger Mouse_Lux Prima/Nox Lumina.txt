Nox Lumina LyricsSomewhere in my room
Sometimes, I don't lock the door
Every time I close my eyes
Someone else's paradise
Turns me into someone new, somewhere
Somewhere in my room
Sometimes, I lie on the floor
Every time I close my eyes
Someone else's paradise
Turns me into someone new (Somewhere)
Somewhere in my room
Sometimes, I don't lock the door
Every time I close my eyes
Someone else's paradise
Turns me into someone new (Somewhere)
Somewhere in my room
Sometimes, I don't lock the door
Every time I close my eyes
Someone else's paradise
Turns me into someone new
Every time I close my eyes
Turns me into someone newEmbed
