Redeemer Lyrics
Blood moves still in my deep blue vein
Gotta cut my teeth on a diamond chain
My lips are cracked, all black and blue
You're not coming for me, I'm coming for you

You're not coming for me, I'm coming for you
Not coming for me, I'm coming for you
Not coming for me, I'm coming for you
Not coming for me, not coming for me

They let me out, I've done my time
I'm breathing out, out of the light
And I've got lust, and you got lost
So I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you

Pry me loose from your deep blue vein
Gotta squeeze my heart, my heart's not sane
My skin is cracked, all black and blue
You're not coming for me, I'm coming for you

You're not coming for me, I'm coming for you
Not coming for me, I'm coming for you
Not coming for me, I'm coming for you
Not coming for me, not coming for me
They let me out, I've done my time
I'm breathing out, out of the light
And I've got lust, and you got lost
So I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you
They let me out, I've done my time
I'm breathing out, out of the light
And I've got lust, and you got lost
So I'm coming for you, I'm coming for you

If you wanna lose your maker
You gotta shake, shake her off your tail
If you wanna lose your maker
You gotta shake, shake her off your tail
If you wanna lose your maker
You gotta shake, shake her off your tail
If you wanna lose your maker
You gotta shake, shake her off your tailEmbed
