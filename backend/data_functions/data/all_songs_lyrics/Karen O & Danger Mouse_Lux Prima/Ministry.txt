Ministry Lyrics
Light on the street, keep me blind
Sand on my feet, you're running me out of town
Out of my mind
Thousands of leaves, they bury me under her eyes
Mild breeze is telling me it's not my time
She's not mine

So day by day, I'll turn my dreams
Into a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love
Day by day, I'll turn my dreams
Into a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love

I'm lost in the sea of sweet design
Smoke that I breathe awakens me and she's divine
But she's not mine

So day by day, I'll turn my dreams
Into a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love
Day by day, I'll turn my dreams
Into a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love

Heaven up above, may lift my thoughts of you
Hand that touched the earth
Make me lovely and touch me, too
Make me crystal pure, cast my heart anew
So day by day, I'll turn my dreams
Into a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love
Day by day, I'll turn my dreams
Into a ministry, a ministry, a ministry of her love2Embed
