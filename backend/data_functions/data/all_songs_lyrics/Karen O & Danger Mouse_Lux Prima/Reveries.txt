Reveries Lyrics
Veil of thorns disguises me
When I'm at the door, I go quietly
Into your arms, I lose myself
Through space, I fell
Through space, I fell

As I slip down underneath
Please don't tempt me with your ecstasy
So when I go, I go quietly
Out of your arms
Through space, I fell

Through space, I fell
Through space, I fell
Out of your arms
Through space, I fell
I've falling deep through my reveries
Into your arms
Through space, I fell

Through space, I fell
Through space, I fell
Out of your arms
Through space, I fell
I've falling deep through my reveries
Out of your arms
Through space, I fell1Embed
