Drown Lyrics
When the darkness looked away
And the stars don't frown on me
When the fire's burning blue through you
We're alive inside a flame
And the night's a brighter shade
When the fire's burning blue through you

Please, let me drown
Please, let me drown

Pool emotes without color
It knows the sea is dark there
Without light, it knows the fire, they can't find it

When the tide pulls away
Not the one you need to save
All the lies, they were coming true with you

So please, let me drown
Please, let me drown
Feeling alight in my shoes
Feeling alight on my feet
Feeling alight in my shoes
Light the fire, oh, light the flame
Light the fire, oh, light the flame
Feeling alight on my feet
Light the fire, oh, light the flame
Light the fire, oh, light the flameEmbed
