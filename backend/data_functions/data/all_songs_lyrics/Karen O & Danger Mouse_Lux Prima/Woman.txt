Woman Lyrics
If you want it, then you take it
Forget what you see when you close your eyes
Girl, you'll make it

I'm a woman, what you see
I'm a woman, what you see
I'm a woman, what you see
What you see ain't what I need, oh

You don't want it, then don't take it
No rest for the weak, no sleep at night
You can make it
You're gonna want it, you're gonna make it
You forget what you see when you close your eyes
You can take it

I'm a woman, what you see
I'm a woman, what you see
I'm a woman, what you see
It run through me, it run through me, oh

Won't you come be my friend
Won't you come be my friend
Cause the only other friend I could ever be is to me
I'm a woman, what you see
I'm a woman, what you see
I'm a woman, what you see
It run through me, it run through me, oh

I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yeah-eh-eh
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yeah-eh-eh
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yeah-eh-eh
I'm a woman, I'm a woman, yeah-eh-ehEmbed
