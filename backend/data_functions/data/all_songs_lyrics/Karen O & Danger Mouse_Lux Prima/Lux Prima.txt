Lux Prima Lyrics

Faithful
Sunshine

No eyes open, no eyes closed
No smoke on your breath, no eyes closed
No sun on the glass, no darkness
No eyes, nobody but you

I'm nowhere, I'm no one, I'm nobody
There's nobody but you
I'm nowhere, I'm no one, I'm nobody
There's nobody but you

Look, boy, you stay on my mind
Look, boy, you stay on my mind
Look, boy, you stay on my mind
Look, boy, you stay on my mind

No eyes open, no eyes closed
It's not what you said, no eyes closed
No drops in the glass, no one listening
No sound, nobody but you
I'm nowhere, I'm no one, I'm nobody
There's nobody but you
I'm nowhere, I'm no one, I'm nobody
There's nobody but you

(No, no, no eyes open)
No one listening
(No, no, no eyes open)
No sound, nobody but you
