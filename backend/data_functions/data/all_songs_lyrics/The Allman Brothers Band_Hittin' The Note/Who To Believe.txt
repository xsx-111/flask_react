Who To Believe LyricsWoke up this morning, something robbed me of my sleep
Reached for you but all I felt was a cold and empty sheet
Three nights on the road babe, and I don't know where you been
Say you're working late could it be you got another man
Somebody said they saw you in a little club downtown
Your arms around a stranger, y'all was really goin' to town
You say they're just jealous, that you'll always be mine
But nigh time has a thousand eyes, could they all be blind?
Or am I a fool, am I a fool?
Cause this confusion is killing me
They all say that you're doing me wrong
But our love is much too strong
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
Who to Believe?
Baby I really need you, I love you like a child
But I won't have no cheatin' woman tellin' lies and runnin' wild
I really want to believe you when you say that you'd be true
But everywhere I look, seems like the finger points to you
Or am I a fool, am I a fool?
Cause this confusion is killing me
They all say that you're doing me bad
But you're the best thing I've ever had
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
Who to Believe?
Or am I a fool, am I a fool?
Cause this confusion is killing me
They all say that you're doing me wrong
But our love is much too strong
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
Or am I a fool, am I a fool?
Cause this confusion is killing me
They all say that you're doing me bad
But you're the best thing I've ever had
Somebody tell me, somebody tell me
