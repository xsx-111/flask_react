Old Before My Time LyricsThere is a long hard Road follows for behind me
Its so cold I'm about to die
Chasing a dream around the world
Its got me feeling down
Though it use to make me high
Looking for answers searching for the truth
In an ocean of lies
Trying to find a reason to make the whole thing right
Will make you old before your time
When I was younger
I thought I ruled the world
It was an oyster at my feet
Dancing to my own drum
Fishing out the pearl
Wish I would have been much more discreet
I've lived a lifetime
Acting out apart
Its been a long uphill climb
Now all the things that use to mean so much to me
Has made me old before my time
Chorus:
Wondering aimlessly,wondering down
Would it ever be much different now
Remind me of the past
I slip into a dream
Funny things ain't never what they seem
Solo:
Living like children
Never doing what we are told
Would not hesitate to take a chance
That road behind me now was paved with fool's gold
Its almost time for the victory dance
No more feeling guilty
For things I never did
Feeling nothing for my crime
Living like a gypsy
Dreaming like a kid
It's made me old before my time…
There is a long hard road, it lies so far behind me…Embed
