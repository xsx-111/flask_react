High Cost of Low Living Lyrics
You're the life of the party, everybody's host
Still you need somewhere you can hide
All your good time friends
And your fairweather has-beens
Lord knows, just along for the ride
You think you're a survivor
But boy, you better think twice
No one rides for nothing
So, step up and pay the price

It's the high cost of low living
Ain't it high time, you turn yourself around?
Yeah, the high cost of low living
Is bound to put you six feet in the ground

So many here who love you
But still, you just can't tell
The real ones from those who drop your name
All the while behind your back
They rip the flesh right from your bones
You should know by now, we're all fair game
You've been chasing each dream with whiskey
From here to Tokyo
Using up all your real friends
Places left to go
It's the high cost of low living
Ain't it high time, you turn yourself around?
Yeah, the high cost of low living
Is bound to put you six feet in the ground

Don't look behind you
Ah, don't look back
Don't try to find reason in the past
Past is gone, gone at last

It's high cost of low living
It's high time you turn yourself around
Well, the high cost of low living
Is bound to put you six feet in the groundEmbed
