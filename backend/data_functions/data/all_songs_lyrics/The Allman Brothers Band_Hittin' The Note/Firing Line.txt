Firing Line LyricsKnown you since you've been born
Raisin' hell even as a child
Nothing's changed since that day
You're still out running wild
Hellhound on your trail
Gettin' closer with every passing mile
Hey now baby
Don't you think it's high time
To change your life's direction
Get off the firing line
Well your luck just ain't been running
Lord, very smooth these days
I think it's finally come down
You're gonna have to mend your ways
With your head up in the clouds
You cannot see through the haze
Hey now sweet baby
Don't you think it's high time
To change your life's direction
Get off the firing line
Step outside, take a look aroud
Do you see anyone who cares?
Spent your whole life steppin' on your friends
Still you ain't nowhere
Search for a new direction
But the past is all you'll find
You can count up all your mistakes
Blame it on your criminal mind
When you lay down with snakes
You come up poisoned every time
Hey now baby
Don't you think it's high time
To change your life's direction
Get off the firing line
Get off the firing line
Get off the firing lineEmbed
