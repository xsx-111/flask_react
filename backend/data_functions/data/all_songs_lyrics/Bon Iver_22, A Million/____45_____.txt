____45_____ Lyrics
Well I been carved in fire
Well I been carved in fire
I been caught in fire, whaaaa
Well I been caught in fire
I been carved in fire
I been caught in fire
What comes prior to


I been caught in a fire
I stayed down the other night
I been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)
I been caught in fire
I stayed down the other night
(5 lane divers)
I been caught in fire
I stayed down
(Without knowing what the truth is)

Fire
