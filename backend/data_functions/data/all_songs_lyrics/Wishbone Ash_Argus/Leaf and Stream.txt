Leaf and Stream LyricsFind myself beside a stream of empty thought
Like a leaf that's fallen to the ground
And carried by the flow of water to my dreams
Woken only by your sound
Alone I've walked this path for many years
Listened to the wind that calls my name
The weeping trees of yesterday look so sad
Await your breath of spring again
Far beyond the hills
Where earth and sky will meet again
Are shadows like an opening hand
Control the secrets
That I've yet to find and wonder at
The light in which they stand
Find myself beside a stream of empty thought
Like a leaf that's fallen to the ground
And carried by the flow of water to my dreams
Woken only by your sound
Far beyond the hills
Where earth and sky will meet again
Are shadows like an opening hand
Control the secrets
That I've yet to find and wonder at
The light in which they standEmbed
