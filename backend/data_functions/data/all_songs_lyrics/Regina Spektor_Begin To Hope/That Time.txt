That Time LyricsHey, remember that time when I found a human tooth
Down on Delancey
Hey, remember that time when we decided to kiss anywhere except the mouth
Hey, remember that time when my favorite colors was pink and green
Hey, remember that month when I only ate boxes of
Tangerines, so cheap and juicy
Tangerines
Hey, remember that time when I would only read
Shakespeare
Hey, remember that other time when I would only read the backs of cereal boxes
Hey, remember that time I tried to save a pigeon with a broken wing
A street cat got him by morning and I had to bury pieces of his body in our building's playground
I thought I was gonna be sick
I thought I was gonna be sick
Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke Parliaments
Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke
Marlboros
Hey, remember that time when I would only smoke
Camels
Hey, remember that time when I was broke
I didn't care I just borrowed from my friends
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
Hey, remember that time when you OD'd
Hey, remember that other time when you OD'd for the second time
Well, in the waiting room, while waiting for news of you, I hallucinated I could read your mind
And I was on a lot of shit, too, but what I saw, man...
I tell you it was freaky
