Hotel Song Lyrics
Come in, come in

Come into my world
I've got to show, show, show you
Come into my bed
I've got to know, know, know you

I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my
You will never be my fool
Will never be my fool

Floaters in my eyes
Wake up in a hotel room
Cigarettes and lies
I am a child, it's too soon

I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my
You will never be my fool
Will never be my fool
A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress?
I figured out her number
It's on a paper napkin
But I don't know her address

I wade downstairs
The porter smiles to me a smile I've bought
With a couple of gold coins
A sign that I've been caught

I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my
You will never be my dear
Will never be my dear, dear friend

Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum
A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress?
I figured out her number
It's on a paper napkin
But I don't know her address

Come into my world
I've got to show, show, show you
Come into my bed
I've got to know, know, know you

I have dreams of orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my
You will never be my dear
Will never be my dear, dear friend

Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend
Ba-da-da-dum, ba-bum
Dear, dear friend1Embed
