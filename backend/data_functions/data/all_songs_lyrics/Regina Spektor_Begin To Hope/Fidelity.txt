Fidelity Lyrics
Shake it up

I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost in the sounds

I hear in my mind
All these voices
I hear in my mind
All of these words
I hear in my mind
All this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart
Well, it breaks my heart

Suppose I never ever met you
Suppose we never fell in love
Suppose I never ever let you
Kiss me so sweet and so soft
Suppose I never ever saw you
Suppose you never ever called
Suppose I kept on singing love songs
Just to break my own fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Just to break my fall
Break my fall, break my fall

All my friends say that of course it's
Gonna get better, gonna get better
Better, better, better, better
Better, better, better

I never loved nobody fully
Always one foot on the ground
And by protecting my heart truly
I got lost in the sounds

I hear in my mind
All of these voices
I hear in my mind
All of these words
I hear in mind
All this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

I hear in my mind
All of these voices
I hear in my mind
All of these words
I hear in my mind
All of this music
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart

And it breaks my heart
Oh and it breaks my heart
Oh and it breaks my heart
Oh and it breaks my heart
Breaks my heart
Oh and it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
Oh and it breaks my heart19Embed
