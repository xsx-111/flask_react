Summer in the City Lyrics
Summer in the city
Means cleavage, cleavage, cleavage
And I start to miss you, baby, sometimes
I've been staying up drinking
In the late night establishments
Telling strangers personal things

Summer in the city
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
So I went to a protest just to rub up against strangers
And I did feel like coming
But I also felt like crying
And it doesn't seem so worth it right now

And the castrated ones stand in the corner smoking
They want to feel the bulges in their pants start to rise
At the sight of a beautiful woman
They feel nothing but anger
Her skin makes them sick in the night
Nauseous, nauseous, nauseous

Summer in the city
I'm so lonely, lonely, lonely
I've been hallucinating you, babe
At the backs of other women
And I tap them on the shoulder
And they turn around smiling but
There's no recognition in their eyes
Oh, summer in the city!
Means cleavage, cleavage, cleavage
Don't get me wrong, dear
In general I'm doing quite fine
It's just when it's summer in the city
And you are long gone from the city
I start to miss you, baby, sometimes

When it's summer in the city
And you are so long gone from the city
I start to miss you, baby, sometimes
Oh, I start to miss you, baby, sometimes
Oh, I start to miss you, baby, sometimesEmbed
