Is It True? Lyrics
How come you love him when he
Takes you for a fool
He's only looking for a good time
How can he love you when he
Treats you mean and cruel
He's not the best thing that you could find

Is it true?
I can't believe it
Is it true?
I just can't see it
Is it true?
Is that you?

When we were young, we didn't really have a care
You were hung up, i had a good line
I never knew it then but, man, i was in love
How could i know it was the right time?


Yes, i was so wrong
For leading you on
There wasn't much i could do
I was a wild one, but i can change some
If that's important to you
Is it true- you've lost that feeling?
Is it true- you might be leaving?
Is it true?
She's really leavingEmbed
