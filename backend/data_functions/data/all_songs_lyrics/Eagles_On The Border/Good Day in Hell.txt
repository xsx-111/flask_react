Good Day in Hell Lyrics
Move in
Can't you see she wants you
She has you deep in her eyes
You been wondering why she haunts you
Beauty in the devil's disguise
She can tell you all about it
She sees it in the stars
She'll burn you if you try to put her down

Oh well, it's been a good day in hell
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound

Higher
She can keep you loaded
Feeding you whiskey and wine
Fire
The devil's on the phone
He laughs and says you're doing just fine
In that big book of names
I wanna go down in flames
Seein's how I'm goin' down

Truckin', that's all that I've been doin'
Every girl's a fork in the road
Stuck in some sticky situations
Feelin' like I wanna explode
All this gratification
And sick conversation
Someone get me out of town
Oh well, it's been a good day in hell
And tomorrow I'll be glory bound2Embed
