You Never Cry Like a Lover Lyrics
You never cry like a lover should
Sigh when it feels real good
Or see the sky through the stone and wood
You never cry like a lover
I thought i saw somebody i loved
Sleeping deep inside you
If i could catch you in an unguarded moment
I'd stay right here beside you
You never smile at me late at night
Laugh out loud when we get it right
You can't get loose if there's too much light
You never smile like a lover
Try a little harder
I can't live with you baby, can't live without it
Try a little harder
And sometimes i believe in love
Sometimes i doubt it
But your life goes on
Like a broken down carousel
Where somebody left the music on

I was hoping you were the one 

You never move like you used to do
Pour it out when you're feeling blue
Somebody must have put some pain on you
You never cry like a lover
(you never cry like a lover)
Cry
(you never cry like a lover)
You never cry
(cry like a lover)
Come on and cry
(you never cry like a lover)
You never cry
(cry like a lover)
You never cry
(cry like a lover)2Embed
