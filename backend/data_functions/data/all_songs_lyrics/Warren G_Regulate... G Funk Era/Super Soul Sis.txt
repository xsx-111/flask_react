Super Soul Sis Lyrics
Well it's the super, the duper, the Landcruisin' trooper
 at time they hang on my rhymes like Mr. Cooper
I'm takin' you to a zone that's much far from wackness
So please could you tell me oh but buddy can you hack this?
Yo, oh no, grab a hoe, debatables, gettin' her flows on
Like FloJo, runs in a marathon
Smooth like chocolate, so call me Big Mamma Kane
Feels like another one goin' out for her reign
Step back, because I happen to be all that plus tax
And got more subscribers than HBO or Cinemax
Mile after mile, I rip style after style
Cracked open all the valves, ooh I'm glad I used Dial
'Cause it can get funky when I'm singin' my song
But I just flow on, and so on, not stinky 'cause I roll on
And then I hear encore and I won't give it a rest
That's how I got the motherfuckin' Super on my chest

Fly through the sky gettin' love
(The whole wide world will watch me)
Fly through the sky gettin' love
(The whole wide world will watch me)

Mister it's the, Masta Aces of the spade
Rappin skills are thinner than niggas on AIDS
Up up and away it's the Super Soul Sis
I talk so much shit, I got halitosis
I knows this, I flows this, how funky, you stank
You a walkin' blood bank I withdraw my shank
Thanks for the memories, remember me no remedies
So render the vicinity or catch a cap like a Kennedy
'Cause I'm the Superwoman rapper of this era, hail
Chasin' MC's, got em on the run like Smurfs from Azrael
No bluff, the magic I puff, I'm chokin' sho 'nuff
I'm takin' a bite out of rappers if my name was MC NiGruff
(She's hotter than the South land on fire)
All you MC's desire, to run through my pyre
I'm turnin' heads like the Exorcist while flexin' this
'Cause it's the Super Soul Sis
Fly through the sky gettin' love
(The whole wide world will watch me)
Fly through the sky gettin' love
(The whole wide world will watch me)

Sat on the outside, but now I'm in the arena
A superfly mackadocious one you never seen a
Soulful, cause I got a bowl-full of soul
Strollin because I have no vehicle to roll
But bring it bring it back to the topic of this flow of mine
I can flow upbeat, to a slow beat, and be offbeat and still on time
I rhyme, and swim waves of soul like Billy Ocean
Never ashy, lyrics that soothe ya like some lotion
'Cause I can Krush any Groove bust on any move ya make
I keep my rhymes attached, like trains to a freight
Break ya Achy like Billy Ray, I'm fuckin up the industry
And fins to be, Nanu Nanu like Mork and Mindy

Fly through the sky gettin' love
(The whole wide world will watch me)
Fly through the sky gettin' love
(The whole wide world will watch me)5Embed
