King of Spain Lyrics
I never knew I was a lover
Just cause I steal the things you hide
Just cause I focus while we're dancing
Just cause I offered you a ride
Still I am not from Barcelona
I am not even from Madrid
I am a native of the North folk
And that can mess up any kid

Well if you could reinvent my name
Well if you could redirect my day
I wanna be the King of Spain

And I will settle in Pamplona
And I'll provoke the bulls with words
And then I'll send a man to meet them all
The blood is fake, so I have heard
And all the senoritas sighing
Will be the fountain of my lies
But while we're floating in siestas
You search for bottles and for knives
Well if you could reinvent my name
Well if you could redirect my day
I wanna be the King of Spain

And I wear my boots of Spanish leather
Oh while I'm tightening my crown
I'll disappear in some flamenco
Perhaps I'll reach the other side
Why are you stamping my illusion?
Just cause I stole some eagle's wings
Because you named me as your lover
Well, I thought I could be anything

Well if you could reinvent my name
Well if you could redirect my day
I wanna be the King of Spain2Embed
