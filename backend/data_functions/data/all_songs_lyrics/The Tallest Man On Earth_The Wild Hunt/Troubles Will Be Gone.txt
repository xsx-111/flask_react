Troubles Will Be Gone LyricsOh, when it's god I see in headlights kneeling down
On frozen highways
And salvation in white knuckles on a wheel
And the deer is in the audience
By the border of the darkness
Where forgiveness grows and slowly winds away
Well there's a question somewhere asked with
All the answers inside
But I'll never find the kid before she's gone
Well the day is never done
But there's a light on where you're sleeping
So I hope somewhere that troubles will be gone
But now the ghost is in my jacket
And my stairs were built in anger
Winding forcefully but end up where I stand
But there are no rocks or salt and nails
I load my cannons not to kill you
Simply lost the words to tell you I'm afraid
And there's a sign up to a hill to see the far of the land
Well the sign will tell you
"Turn if there's a one"
Still the day is never done
But there's a light on where you're sleeping
So I hope somewhere that troubles will be gone
Oh darling, when it's you I see in headlights
Driving down the golden highway
And salvation in the beauty of some brace
And the deer is gone without me to the valley of surrender
There is still another world along its tracks
But there's that sign up to a hill to see the far of the land
Well the sign will say
"There's still a higher one"
And now the day is slowly setting down
And the lights on where you're sleeping
So I hope somewhere that troubles will be goneEmbed
