The Drying of the Lawns Lyrics
She said I cannot tell you why, she said I'm in a rush
There are softer dreams for you to think about now love
Things that you have seen this night runs by that the river's flow
I can use you if you're in the flame, I'm a growin' old

And no this is not the summer dream she said
It's just the drying of the lawns I want to leave out there

Well, I've said I've sailed the frozen corners of the dark Atlantic Sea
And I drifted on the waves and the mirage beneath
And never have I felt such numb and pointless searchin' true
As when I set my eyes and torched the plans on the mark of you

And no this is not the summer dream she said
It's just the drying of the lawns I want to leave out there

She said you follow me like sheep that think this cane could do some harm
But I tell you, boy I'm frightened still with a sister's heart
I set my eyes upon the shore whenever you wake up
I'm leavin' 'cause you don't fear what you're dreamin' of
And no this is not the summer dream she said
It's just the drying of the lawns I want to leave out there

But I will stand down in the hallway with no thought to leave the set
Of a movie I will sure as hell not end just yet
If evenings are for romance then this mornin' is for us
It will never end and our last dream will leave this house

And no this is not the summer dream I said
It's just the drying of the lawns that want to leave us here
Oh, it's the drying of the lawns that want to leave us hereEmbed
