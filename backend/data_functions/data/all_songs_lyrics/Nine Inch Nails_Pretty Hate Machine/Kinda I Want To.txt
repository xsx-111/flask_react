Kinda I Want To Lyrics
I can't shake this feeling from my head
There's a devil sleeping in my bed
He's watching you from across the way
I cannot make this feeling go away

I know it's not the right thing
And I know it's not the good thing

But kinda I want to
Kinda I want to

I'm not sure of what I should do
When every thought I'm thinking of is you
All of my excuses turn to lies
Maybe God will cover up his eyes

And I know it's not the right thing
And I know it's not the good thing

But kinda I want to
Kinda I want to
Kinda I want to
Kinda I want to
Kinda I want to, maybe just for tonight
We can pretend it's alright
What's the price I pay?
I don't care what they say

I want to
I want to
I want to
I want to
I want to
I want to
I want to
I want to

I'll take my chance tonight3Embed
