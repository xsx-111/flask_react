Jonny Sniper Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen
Show your appreciation for Jonny Sniper!
(Okay, Jonny, let's go!)
Rise, taste the air
Lock and load, pull the trigger
Climb to new heights
And tell me, tell me what you hear

A whisper from the wind
And I can't help but listen
It warns us of disaster
And I can't help but wonder
Can anyone hear the same distress call?

So this is a quest to save the world
And he'll always be here for another
Another day, another chance to rescue

(Okay, Jonny, lock and load)
This is all I need to feel alive
(Remember now, aim small, miss small)
The crashing of white waves
And I can't help but listen, oh
The screaming of the Earth
And I can't help but...

So this is a quest to save the world
And he'll always be here for another
Another day, another chance to rescue

And this is all I need to feel alive, oh yeah
("Hey Jonny!") This is all I need to feel alive
"Way to save the world!
Way to save the world!
Way to save the world!
Way to save the world!"

So this is a quest to save the world
And he'll always be here for another
Another day, another chance to rescue
So this is a quest to save the world
And he'll always be here for another
Another day, another chance to rescue
This is all I need to feel alive
This is all I need to feel alive
This is all I need to feel alive
This is all I need to feel alive
This is all I need to feel alive
This is all I need to feel alive
This is all I need to feel alive
This is all I need to feel alive
This is all I need to feel aliveEmbed
