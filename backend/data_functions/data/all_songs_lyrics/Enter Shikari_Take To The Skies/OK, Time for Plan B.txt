OK, Time for Plan B Lyrics
Let this battle commence, one last time
Let this battle commence, one last time
Let this battle commence, one last time
And I hope for your sake that you're on our side
Let this battle commence, one last time
And I hope for your sake that you're on our side

Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah, you've lost the will to do what's right again
Look what you've done to yourself
We were shy
We'll fight like sharks
We'll fight like dogs
Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah, you've lost the will to do what's right again
Look what you've done to yourself, yeah

We've tried to communicate
But we've got no patience
Let's reclaim this throne
Why should we negotiate?
Let's finish this now!
Let's settle this now
For once and for all!
Let's settle this now
For once and for all!

Let this battle commence, one last time
And I hope for your sake that you're on our side
Let this battle commence, one last time
And I hope for your sake that you're on our side

Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah, you've lost the will to do what's right again
Look what you've done to yourself
We were shy
We'll fight like sharks
We'll fight like dogs
Look what you've done to yourself
Yeah, you've lost the will to do what's right again
Look what you've done to yourself
We were shy
We'll fight like sharks
We'll fight like dogs
The time has come to think again
To think again
Look what you've done to yourself

OK, time for plan B
This means war!
This means war!
This means war!
This means war!
Everyone freezes
And waits for the earth to move
Everyone freezes
And waits for the ground to shake

Let's make the earth move
Let's make the ground shake
Let's make the earth move
Let's make the ground shake
Let's make the earth move
Let's make the ground shake
Let's make the earth move
Let's make the ground shakeEmbed
