Enter Shikari Lyrics
Shit! Shit!

"I've been hiding here for a thousand years
Waiting for your ghost
I've been hiding here for a thousand years
Waiting for your ghost"
Your life's about to flash before your eyes
Your life's about to flash before your eyes

Stand your ground; this is ancient land
I was guided here by the spirit’s hand
We shall meet at hell's gate
This is fate (This is fate)
This is fate (This is fate)
“Not all is lost,” the spirits cry
You will be hunted (We shall seek)
Perseverance, turn the page
Enter Shikari! Enter Shikari!

We're not hiding (We're not hiding)
We're not hiding (We're not hiding)
We're not hiding, now (We're not hiding, now)
I'm in the zone
I'm in the zone
Alright

And still, we will be here, standing like statues
And still, we will be here, standing like statues
And still, we will be here, standing like statues
And still, we will be here, standing like statues
And still, we will be here, standing like statues
And still, we will be here, standing like statues1Embed
