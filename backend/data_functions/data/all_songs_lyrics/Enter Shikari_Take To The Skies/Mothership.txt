Mothership Lyrics
"Go tell all your friends that this is the end!
Go tell all your friends that this is the end!"
"Go tell all your friends that this is the end!"
"This is the end!"

I don't understand a word you're saying
What are the clouds running from?
There's something in the air, tonight
(Something is wrong) Spit it out!

"I just fell from the Mothership
They said that
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed"

There's something in the air
There's something in the air
In the air, in the air
Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
In the air, in the air
Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
And I'll scream with a thousand voices...
I am sane! I am sane!
My soul felt so safe, up there
No self-centered natives destroying our earth

"I just fell from the Mothership
They said that
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed"

Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Walk the plank!
Walk the plank! Walk the plank! Walk the plank!
Walk the plank!

Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers were always lying on the ocean bed3Embed
