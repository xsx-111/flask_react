Adieu Lyrics
And I long for you to appear
After losing your way across star riddled skies
To carry you home
And I long for you to appear
After losing your way across star riddled skies
To carry you home
I cherish my loss
A gentle reminder
That life is unkind
At the best of times
And I long for you to appear
After losing your way across star riddled skies
To carry you home
I cherish my loss
A gentle reminder
That life is unkind
At the best of times
Brace yourself 'cause I think I'm coming for you
Brace yourself 'cause I think I'm coming for you
Look up into the sky, look up into the sky
Brace yourself 'cause I think I'm coming for you
Brace yourself 'cause I think I'm coming for you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you

Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you

Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding you
Home could be anywhere when I am holding youEmbed
