Labyrinth Lyrics
Help! The air turns black
The birds drop from the sky
This eagle has landed
I'm choking on your pride

And the walls are closing in
And you don't appreciate
That in my hands (Tonight!)
Is where your fate lies
Her face drains

(Stand) Stand up and take a bow
You have no reason to celebrate
(You're) You're lost in the labyrinth
Scream now, it's not too late

Help! The air turns black
The birds drop from the sky
This eagle has landed
I'm choking on your pride

And the walls are closing in
And you don't appreciate
That in my hands (Tonight!)
Is where your fate lies
Her face drains
(Stand) Stand up and take a bow
You have no reason to celebrate
(You're) You're lost in the labyrinth
Scream now, it's not too late

Nothing seems to break the walls down
Break the walls down
Nothing seems to break the walls down
Break the walls down

We'll break the walls
We'll break the walls
We'll break the walls down
We'll break the walls (We'll break the walls!)
We'll break the walls (We'll break the walls!)
We'll break the walls down

Well, it looks like the end is nigh for our friends here
He's finding it hard to keep his head
Especially with his girl screaming in his ear
We've gotta ask ourselves, do they deserve this?
It's a minute to make your mind up o'clock
Speak now or forever hold your peace!
Will he make it out?
I hope he makes it out
He's gonna make it out
He's gotta make it out
(Stand) Stand up
(You're) You're lost
