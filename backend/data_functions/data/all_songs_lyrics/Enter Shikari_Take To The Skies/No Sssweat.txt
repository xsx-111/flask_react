No Sssweat LyricsWhere's your respect?
(Where's your respect?)
Why bite the hand that feeds you?
It's not over yet
(It's not over yet)
Plenty more fingers for you to nibble
I'd like to see you get your teeth round this
I'm sure your jaw will sorely be missed
Not even salt can make your hands taste good
I'm still crunching your lifeline
Not even salt can make your hands taste good
I'm still crunching your lifeline
You do this every fucking time
No sweat, no tears, no guilt
You do this every fucking time
No sweat, no tears, no guilt
Not even salt can make your hands taste good
I'm still crunching your lifeline
Lifeline, lifeline, lifeline
Blood fills your palms
Lifeline, lifeline, lifeline
Blood fills your palms
Lifeline, lifeline, lifeline
Blood fills your palms
Where's your respect?
(Where's your respect?)
Why bite the hand that feeds you?
It's not over yet
(It's not over yet)
Plenty more fingers for you to nibble
I'd like to see you get your teeth round this
I'm sure your jaw will sorely be missed
Not even salt can make your hands taste good
I'm still crunching your lifeline
Not even salt can make your hands taste good
I'm still crunching your lifeline
You do this every fucking time
No sweat, no tears, no guilt
You do this every fucking time
No sweat, no tears, no guilt
Do this one more time and I'll bite your fucking fingers off!Embed
