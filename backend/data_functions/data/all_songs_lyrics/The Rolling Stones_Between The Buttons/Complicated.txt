Complicated Lyrics
She looks so simple in her way
Does the same thing every day
But she's dedicated to having her own way
She's very complicated

Women seem to fill her mind
And many men in so short time
But she's underrated, she treats me oh so kind
She's very complicated
Yeah!

We talk together and discuss
What is really best for us
She's sophisticated, my head's fit to bust
'Cause she's so complicated
Break!

Yeah!

She knows just how to please her man
She's softer than a baby lamb
But she's educated, doesn't give a damn
She's very complicated
Break!
Na na na na na
Yeah!

She looks so simple in her way
Does the same thing everyday
But she's dedicated to having her own way
She's very complicated
Break!

Break!
Na na come on, baby!
Na na na na na
Na na na na, yeah
A-come on, baby
Uh! Come on, babeEmbed
