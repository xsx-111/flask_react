Something Happened to Me Yesterday Lyrics
Something happened to me yesterday
Something I can't speak of right away
Something happened to me
Something oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday

He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something
Something very strange I hear you say
You're talking in a most peculiar way
But something really threw me
Something oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday (yesterday...)

He don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause
Something
What kind of joint is this?
Take your partners

He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something
Someone says there's something more to pay
For sins that you committed yesterday
It's really rather drippy
But something oh, so trippy
Something happened to me yesterday (right!)

He don't know just where it's gone
He don't really care at all
No one's sure just what it was
Or the meaning and the cause
Something
Someone's singing loud across the bay
Sitting on a mat about to pray
Isn't half as loony
As something oh, so groovy
Something happened to me yesterday (right!)
He don't know if it's right or wrong
Maybe he should tell someone
He's not sure just what it was
Or if it's against the law
Something
Well, thank you very much
And now I think it's time for us all to go
So from all of us to all of you
Not forgetting the boys in the band
And our producer, Reg Thorpe
We'd like to say, God Bless
So, if you're out tonight, don't forget
If you're on your bike, wear white
Evening, all1Embed
