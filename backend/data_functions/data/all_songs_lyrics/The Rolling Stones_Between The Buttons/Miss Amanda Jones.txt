Miss Amanda Jones Lyrics
Down and down she goes
Our Amanda Jones
I said down and down and down and down
She'd look really lovely at home
'Til somebody going to come up and ask her
To live happily ever after, Miss Amanda Jones

On and on she goes
Little Miss Amanda Jones
I said on and on and on and on
Just watch her as she grows
Don't want to say it very obviously
But she's losing her nobility, Miss Amanda Jones

Hey girl, don't you realize
The money invested in you?
Hey girl, you've just got to find
Someone who'll really pull your family through

Up and up she goes
Our Amanda Jones
I said up and up and up and up
She looks quite delightfully stoned
She's the darling of the discotheque crowd
Of her lineage she's rightfully proud, Miss Amanda Jones
Hey girl, with your nonsense nose
Pointing right down at the floor
Hey girl, your suspender shows
And the girl behind you looks a bit unsure

Round and round she goes
The world of Amanda Jones
I said round and round and round and round
The balls and the dinners and shows
The little girl, she just wanders about
'Til it's time for her coming out, Miss Amanda Jones

Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and round
Round and round and roundEmbed
