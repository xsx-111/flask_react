Breathe Lyrics
A blue-black shade of love
Sent from above
My hands are tied two worlds alone
And this I know
Your breath's like wine
And just like clouds my skin crawls
It's so divine the sky it glows with fields of light

Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me
I love you
And on this day I will love you
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time

My hands shake clasped with fear as you come near
To say goodnight just like a dove
A peaceful sign
To help us by as you come in
Let this begin
Stars fall like dust our lips will touch
We speak too much
Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me
I love you
And on this day I will love you
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time

Did you know that I love you?
Come and lay with me
I love you
And on this day I will love you
You make me feel alive
And I'll love you
Until the end of time

I've got a lot to say if you will let me
It's always hard when you're around me
But here right now there's interest in your eyes
So hear me out and hear this the first time

That I love you (come and lay with me)
That I love you (and on this day)
That I love you (you make me feel alive)
That I love you
Til' the end of time5Embed
