Secret Crowds Lyrics
(If I had my own world)
(I'd build you an empire)

If I had my own world
I'd fill it with wealth and desire
A glorious past to admire
And voices of kids out walking dogs
Birds, planes, cleanest cars

If I had my own world
I'd love it for all that's inside it
There'd be no more wars death or riots
There'd be no more police-packed parking lots
Guns, bombs sounding off

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence
If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence
Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder

If I had my own world
I'd show you the life that's inside it
The way that it glows when you find it
The way it survives with its families
Friends or its enemies

Let's make this a new world
I swear you can go if you want to
I know that you have that within you
Inventing the first clean and usable
God's greatest miracle

If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence
If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence
Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder
Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder
Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder
Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder4Embed
