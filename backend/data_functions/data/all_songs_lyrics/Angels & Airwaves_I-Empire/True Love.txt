True Love Lyrics
(She's scared...She's a star...Burning across the night time sky)

Yo eh oh eh oh eh oh eh 

The snow has come down on top of everything
The town is alive and well without you (She's scared)
The lights they peer out of the leafless trees
And you won't be alone I am beside you

Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh

(True love)
The stars in the sky illuminate below
The light is the sign that love will guide you home
The stars in the sky illuminate below
If the world were to die the light would guide you

Tears spilling out across a dead end street
Your house is a lonely box that holds you (She's a star)
The star, bright and loud, is in dire need
Of the fear it is an empty fear inside you
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh

(True love)
The stars in the sky illuminate below
The light is the sign that love will guide you home
The stars in the sky illuminate below
If the world were to die the light would guide you
The stars in the sky illuminate below
The light is the sign that love will guide you home
The stars in the sky illuminate below
If the world were to die the light would guide you


The stars in the sky illuminate below
The light is the sign that love will guide you home
The stars in the sky illuminate below
If the world were to die the light would guide you
(True love)
The stars in the sky illuminate below
The light is the sign that love will guide you home (True love)
The stars in the sky illuminate below
If the world were to die the light would guide you
(True love)
The stars in the sky illuminate below
The light is the sign that love will guide you home (True love)
The stars in the sky illuminate below
If the world were to die the light would guide you
(She's a star)1Embed
