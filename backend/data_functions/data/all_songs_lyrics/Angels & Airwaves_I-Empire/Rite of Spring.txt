Rite of Spring Lyrics
I was locked all day in the summer heat
In a small brown house in Suburban Street
With a skateboard and my shit guitar
I'd dream all day that they would get me far
My dad would ask me about my grades
The asshole sports that I never played
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late
It was near when I turned sixteen
Got kicked out of school and so it seemed
That things were closing in and ready to blow
My dad moved out about that year or so
It took an hour to start a punk rock band
To offset my fucked up family land
And as I held my mom would start to cry
I swore ourselves a better life

If I had a chance for another try
I wouldn’t change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine
The summers gone the years have passed
My friends have changed, a few did last
The smallest dreams got pushed aside
The largest ones that changed my life
And all I wish for has come to pass
From Rock N Roll to love and cash
It’s all success if it’s what you need
Do what you like and do it honestly

If I had a chance for another try
I wouldn’t change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine

Hey yo oh oh oh
Hey yo oh oh
Hey yo oh oh oh
Hey yo oh oh
Hey yo oh oh oh
Hey yo oh oh
Hey yo oh oh oh
Hey yo oh oh
If I had a chance for another try
I wouldn’t change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mine
If I had a chance for another try
I wouldn’t change a thing
It's made me all of who I am inside
And if I could thank god
That I am here and that I am alive
And everyday I wake
I tell myself a little harmless lie
The whole wide world is mineEmbed
