Call to Arms Lyrics
There's a little black dark scar tire divide
This is it can you hear me?
Have you ever felt a sad heart buried alive?
You can do almost anything
There's a little red bridge with the view of the sun
With a lake I recommend such a setting sight
And the thousands of stars, come out thousands of times
We can go only if you believe
Only if you believe

Do you feel like you've lost everything you can lose?
This is it can you hear me?
When you cry do your tears ever chill up the room?
Calling out in a moment of need
Do you ever lay awake with a look in the eye
Asking God if a wish is too big to deny?
I will offer a line and it's ready for use
Let me know are you ready for me?

I'd like to say that you're my only fear
And when I dream it slowly disappears
And when I wake I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart beat in and out of time
When the storm brings rain snow fate of all kinds
You can feel almost anything
When the day seems to melt fall flat into night
You can feel almost anything
When you can't go on you got to get up and try
This is it can you feel me?
When the bombs come down you will make it alive
But only if you want to believe

I'd like to say that you're my only fear
And when I dream it slowly disappears
And when I wake I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart beat in and out of time
I'd like to say that you're my only fear
And when I dream it slowly disappears
And when I wake I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart beat in and out of time

Out of time (You're my only)
When I dream (You're my only)
When I dream, I feel your heart
When I dream, I'm out of time (I feel your heart)
When I dream, I'm out of time (I feel your heart)
I feel your heart
I feel your heart
I feel your heart
I'd like to say that you're my only fear
And when I dream it slowly disappears
And when I wake I'm right here by your side
To feel your heart beat in and out of time4Embed
