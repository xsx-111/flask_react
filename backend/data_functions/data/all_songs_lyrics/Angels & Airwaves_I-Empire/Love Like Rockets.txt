Love Like Rockets Lyrics
(Due to the marvels of scientific advance
My voice is coming to you from a satellite circling in outer space
Through this unique means, I convey to you and all of mankind
America's wish for Peace on Earth)

I held my head as I left the ground
The belts grew tight as the blast grew loud
A loving wish whispered in my ear
Please leave with grace, all the best my dear
Yeah it's like
I held your hand as I pulled you in
Your lips sealed tight ready to begin
I kissed you first then you kissed my hair
If I ask you once will you ask me every year?

Do you feel alive? (Imagine imagine)
Do you feel alive? (Imagine imagine)

The sun is set in the night time sky
The stars they cast a glow upon my eyes
The earth itself a burning ball of light
Yeah it's like
When our first love was ignited late that night
Do you feel alive? (Imagine imagine)
Do you feel alive? (Imagine imagine)

The stars in your eyes light up the sky with all its light and fire and sound
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with all its light and fire and sound
Do you feel alive? (Imagine imagine)
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with all its light and fire and sound
Do you feel alive? (Imagine imagine)
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with all its light and fire and sound
Do you feel alive? (Imagine imagine)
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with all its light and fire and sound
Do you feel alive? (Imagine imagine)
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with all its light and fire and sound1Embed
