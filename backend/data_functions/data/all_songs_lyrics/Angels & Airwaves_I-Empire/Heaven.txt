Heaven Lyrics
"Everyone, everyone will listen..."
"Here we go, life's waiting to begin."
"--word that you say/Then say it, I will listen."

I will run the streets and hostile lands
I will touch the rain with all I have
I will breathe the air to scream it loud
My feet will never touch the ground
Because the days they feel like ancient clocks
Like when kids grow up and learn to walk
Because your life is full of pure desire
A place so gloriously wired

With lights and sounds
Oh God, this is such a mess
And it's like our world but we're the last ones left
And the hair it stands on the back of our necks
And I swear it shows
Heaven must be just like this

Do you see the hills beneath the clouds?
And the stars as trails to lead you out?
Can you sense the pain that's everywhere?
And if you try you'll never care
And the love you had when you were young
Is right outside for all to come
Because your life is full of pure desire
A place so gloriously wired
With lights and sounds
Oh God, this is such a mess
And it's like our world but we're the last ones left
And the hair it stands on the back of our necks
And I swear it shows
Heaven must be just like this

If you see a light break through the clouds
And fire up like distant towers
Where the world will begin exactly how it ends
When you call for help when you are lost
Forever more at whatever cost
And the world will begin exactly how it ends

Please stay don't go
I got you now are you curious?
Please stay don't go
I got you now, are you curious?
Please stay don't go
I got you now are you curious?
Please stay don't go
I got you now are you curious?
Please stay don't go
I got you now are you curious?
Please stay don't go
I got you now are you curious?
Please stay don't go
I got you now now yeah yea oh yeah oh yeah oh
Here I am1Embed
