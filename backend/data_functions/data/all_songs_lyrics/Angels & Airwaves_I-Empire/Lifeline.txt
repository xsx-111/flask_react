Lifeline Lyrics
With an urgent careful stare
And some panic in those eyes
If I see you lying there
Hoping this was the last time

If you hear a distant sound
And some footsteps by your side
When the world comes crashing down
I will find you if you hide

If you wish it wish it now
If you wish it wish it loud
If you want it say it now
If you want it say it loud

We all make mistakes
Here's your lifeline
If you want it I want to
We all make mistakes
Here's your lifeline
If you want it I want to
Thereâ€™s a field near the dream
I watched it grow with whitest light
I watched us all reach out and lean
For the strength to touch the sky

If you hear a distant sound
And some footsteps by your side
If you feel like coming round
I will take you for a ride

If you wish it wish it now
If you wish it wish it loud
If you want it say it now
If you want it say it loud

We all make mistakes
Here's your lifeline
If you want it I want to
We all make mistakes
Here's your lifeline
If you want it I want to
Oh

If you want it I want to
If you want it I want to
If you want it I want to
If you want it I want to
If you want it I want to
If you want it I want to
If you want it I want to
If you want it I want to1Embed
