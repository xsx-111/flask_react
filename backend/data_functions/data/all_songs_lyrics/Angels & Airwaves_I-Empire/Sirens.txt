Sirens Lyrics
There's a weakness in the window
Place my footprints in the dark room
There's lonely voices like a scarecrow
In the hallway like a lost ghost
In the bedroom I see a shadow
From the moon with light from a candle
On a bed-frame lies a girl
Her reflection in the mirror

Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada
I like your eyes wide
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada
I've been knocking at your backdoor
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada
Nervous like a knife fight
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada
Be careful what you ask for

I do this from time to time
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
When I can never say the things I mean (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to think of you with me
It's a dark night on the West Coast
Then a soft breeze as the sun rose
Then the phone rang like a gunshot
Like a siren on the beach rock
There's a message at the river
A certain package here to the deliver
When the day breaks after nightfall
I will be there you know I will

Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada
I like your eyes wide
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada
I've been knocking at your backdoor
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada
Nervous like a knife fight
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada
Be careful what you ask for


I can hear you breathe
I'm feeling the shake
And the sound of my heartbeat
Can't let go
Do you know
I'm feeling the pain
Of my first love?
I won't let it go
Can't let go
I do this from time to time
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
When I can never say the things I mean (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I want to taste you as you breathe (from time to time)

I do this from time to time
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I can never say the things I mean (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time)
I do this from time to time
Where I like to think of you with me (from time to time)Embed
