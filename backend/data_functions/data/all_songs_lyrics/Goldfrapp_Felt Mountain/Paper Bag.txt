Paper Bag Lyrics
No time to fuck, but you like the rush
And where would we be without sums
Deals we make?

Brown paper bag, makes for a hat
When it rains on your head, mate
Cheers for that

When the world stops for snow
When you laugh, I'm inside your mouth

Sucking the sun, baboons and birds
With the weight of you dear, I forgot

Brown paper bag, makes for a hat
When it rains on your head, mate
Cheers for that

When the world stops for snow
When you laugh, I'm inside your mouth

When you laugh, I'm inside your mouthEmbed
