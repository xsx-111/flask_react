Pilots Lyrics
Armoured cars sail the sky
They're pink at dawn
If I lived forever you just wouldn't be so beautiful
As the sun when it shines all over the world

We're pilots watching stars
The world pre-occupied
We're pilots watching stars
Who do we think we are?

Ice and clouds shimmer outside
Rain just falls at magic hour
It's just the sound of you and me
Time twitching
Murmurs of our friendly machine

We're pilots watching stars
The world pre-occupied
We're pilots watching stars
Who do we think we are?

We're pilots watching stars
The world pre-occupied
We're pilots watching stars
Who do we think we are?
It's just the sound of you and meEmbed
