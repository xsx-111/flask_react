Lovely Head Lyrics
It starts in my belly, then up to my heart
Into my mouth, I can't keep it shut
Do you recognize the smell?
Is that how you tell us apart?


I fool myself to sleep and dream
Nobody's here, no one but me
So cool, you're hardly there
Why can't this be killing you?


Frankenstein would want your mind
Your lovely head, your lovely head
