Human Lyrics
They fall from your mouth
Propelled by your belly and your tongue
I shiver when you shake and I fold into jelly
I think I loved you more than me

Are you human, or a dud?
Are you human, or d'you make it up?

My baby cherry slipped
Pass me through your fingertips
Throw me down like an old rag
I'm not standing, don't look back

Are you human, or a dud?
Are you human, or d'you make it up?
Are you human, or a dud?
Are you human, or d'you make it up?

They went searching for your body
They went looking, but there's nobody
Who smells like you
Who looks like you
You're not human... too
Are you human, or a dud?
Are you human, or d'you make it up?
Are you human, or a dud?
Are you human, or d'you make it up?

Are you human, or a dud?1Embed
