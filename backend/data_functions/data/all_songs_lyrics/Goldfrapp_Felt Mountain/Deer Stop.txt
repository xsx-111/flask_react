Deer Stop Lyrics
And I long to go
Love started here
Shoot your stars
Be a light
Star

Don't you call
Deer stop, bottle in a shell
Shoot your thousand stars over me

Shoot a star
Shoot a star
To be...

Love to come home
You've arrested me now

Say my name, whisper it
Don't ever turn
I'm deliciously wired
I'm falling in a cloud
Shoot your thousand stars over...
Shoot your thousand stars over...

Lalalalalalalalalalalalalala...

Say my name
Whisper it1Embed
