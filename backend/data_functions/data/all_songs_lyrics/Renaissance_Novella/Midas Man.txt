Midas Man LyricsGold - said the man to the many
I want money and I'll make it grow
I will count my worth in gold - wealth untold
I'll sell my soul - Midas Man
Sold - said the man to the many
Work for me, I'll only steal your time
I will count my money out, there's no doubt
I'll sell my soul - Midas Man - Midas Man
I'll take from the blind and I'll get up ahead
I'll sneak up behind and I'll steal
I'll take all that you have
And then all that you've concealed
I'll take anything I can get - I'll make you
I'll break you and I'll make you sweat
Nothing is worth nothing unless it's
Made for Midas Man
Gold - said the man to the many
Pots of gold are all I want from you
Quarter time for treble days the only way
To sell your soul - Midas Man - Midas Man
I'll take from the blind and I'll get up ahead
I'll sneak up behind and I'll steal
I'll take all that you have
And then all that you've concealed
I'll take anything I can get - I'll make you
I'll break you and I'll make you sweat
Nothing is worth nothing unless it's
Made for Midas Man
