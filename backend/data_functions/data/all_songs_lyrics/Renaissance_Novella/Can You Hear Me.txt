Can You Hear Me LyricsMorning people take the news
A paper window on a world
They live on undisturbed
Thoughts may fly like the lonely birds
And lost behind the silent words
Voices are unheard
Put it down to city life
Oh if I understood
Passing by so easily
I'd reach you if I could
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Fly like a song, fly while you're singing
A song without you, is a bird without winging
Some city flights leave in the morning
Some city nights end without warning
Can you hear me call
Evening people see the day
A silhouette on every face
A shadow on their eyes
I take my place within the crowd
We walk the dusty streets around
Encompassing our lives
Put it down to city times
Oh if I understood
Passing by so casually
I'd reach you if I could
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Fly like a song, fly while you're singing
A song without you, is a bird without winging
Some city flights leave in the morning
Some city nights end without warning
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me call
Calling to the sky
The thunder drowns my voice within the rain
And I know you're near me
And I call throughout the storm
I know that you don't hear me
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name
Can you hear me call your name
Can you hear me call
Hear me call your name
I call your name
I call your name
Can you hear me call your name
Night time people find it hard
To hear themselves above the noise
The music holds its own
I recognised a place I'd known
I turned to find it carved in stone
A mirrored smile alone
Put it down to city nights
Oh if I understood
Passing by so far from me
I'd reach you if I could
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Fly like a song, fly while you're singing
A song without you, is a bird without winging
Some city flights leave in the morning
Some city nights end without warning
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me callEmbed
