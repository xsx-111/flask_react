Something That I Said LyricsOkay, kick me in the head
Just 'cause of something that I said
You don't want to know the truth
'Cause you're wild and full of youth
Something that I said
Was it something that I said?
Something in my head
You ain't got no friends no more
'Cause you kicked them to the floor
Time will tell and you will see
That it's down to you, not me
Something that I said
Was it something that I said?
Something in my head
Okay, now you're on your own
Your self-righteousness has grown
So get off your pedestal
Before you ain't got no friends no more
Something that I said
Was it something that I said?
Something in my head
Something that I said
Was it something that I said?
Something in my head
Something that I said
Was it something that I said?
Something in my head
Something that I said
Something that I said
Was it something that I said?
Something in my head
Something, something
Something that I said
Something in my head
Something that I said
Something that I said
Was it something that I said?
Something in my head
Something in my head
Something, something
Something in my head
Something that I saidEmbed
