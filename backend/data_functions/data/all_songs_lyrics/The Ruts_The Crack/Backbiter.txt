Backbiter LyricsDon't burn my ears off, you're talking 'bout fiction
The words you say are catching fire, you're talking 'bout friction
I don't wanna hear about the downers that you found
Don't wanna know the way that you've been messed around
Backbiter, you're a loser
Backbiter, you're a user
Backbiter, you're a loser
Backbiter, you're a user
You stitch up your friends, you think you've got it sown up
But we can see through you, we know that you suck
I don't wanna know about what happened to your life
Don't wanna know the reasons why you're still alive
Backbiter, you're a loser
Backbiter, you're a user
Backbiter, you're a loser
Backbiter, you're a user
Don't burn my ears off, you're talking 'bout fiction
The words you say are catching fire, you're talking 'bout friction
I don't wanna hear about the downers that you found
Don't wanna know the way that you've been messed around
Backbiter, you're a loser
Backbiter, you're a user
Backbiter, you're a loser
Backbiter, you're a user
Backbiter, you're a loser
Backbiter, you're a user
Backbiter, you're a loser
