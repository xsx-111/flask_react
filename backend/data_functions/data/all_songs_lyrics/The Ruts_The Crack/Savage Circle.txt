Savage Circle LyricsLife's a savage circle
Some people dedicate to ruin my life
Life's a savage circle
Okay, baby said you're alright
You think you know me well
Well, you can go to hell
Your thick gives me a frown
Well, baby it's getting me down
Life's a savage circle
Some people dedicate to ruin my life
Life's a savage circle
Okay, baby said you're alright
You wear that look of doubt
Uncertainty is out
You're lying, I'm just like you
I hope I'm getting through
Life's a savage circle
Some people dedicate to ruin my life
Life's a savage circle
Okay, baby said you're alright
You think you know me well
Well, you can go to hell
Your thick gives me a frown
Well, baby it's getting me down
Life's a savage circle
Some people dedicate to ruin my life
Life's a savage circle
Okay, baby said you're alright
You wear that look of doubt
Uncertainty is out
L'm lying, I'm just like you
I hope I'm getting through
You know, I think you know
It's getting me down
It is getting me down
It is getting me down, down, downEmbed
