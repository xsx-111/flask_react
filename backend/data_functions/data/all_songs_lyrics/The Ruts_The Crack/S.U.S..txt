S.U.S. LyricsStanding on the street, just waiting for a bus
This cop pulls up, they're giving me the S.U.S
They say, "Hey sonny, I think you're on our file
Well, you better come with us for a while"
We got you with S.U.S
You look too obvious
You better come with us
And don't make no fuss
We got you with S.U.S
So they shake me down
Try to make me look like a clown
I just stare at the ground
You better come with us
(We got you with S.U.S.)
You look too obvious
(You better come with us)
And don't make no fuss
(Too obvious)
You better come with us
(Don't make no fuss)
We got you with...
We got you with S.U.S
You look too obvious
(We got you with S.U.S.)
You better come with us
(You look too obvious)
And don't make no fuss
(You better come with us)
We got you with S.U.S
(You look too obvious)
Don't make no fuss
(You better come with us)
We got you with S.U.S
(You better come with us)
We got you with...
(You better come with us)
We got you with...
We got you with S.U.SEmbed
