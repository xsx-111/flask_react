It Was Cold LyricsIt was cold, it was night
I was with you, some time ago
But you were laughing to hide your crying
In shock and dazed, we walked away
You said "be careful", some lights were shining
They came much closer, we started hiding
Then it was silent, I heard you breathing
But far away, someone was screaming
Some dogs were growling, we started running
We kept on running until the daylight
And it was cold, the smoke was heavy
Casualties high, no one was ready
It was cold, it was night
I was with you, some time ago
You said "no, no" in desperation
The world we knew in desolationEmbed
