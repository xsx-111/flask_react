Criminal Mind LyricsGot a criminal mind, treat people unkind
Do it just for kicks, and it's a habit that sticks
You do what you wanna
I do what I wanna do
I do it for kicks
And it's a habit that sticks
Got a dodgy background and people push me â€˜round
Do it just for kicks, and it's a habit that sticks
You do what you wanna
I do what I wanna do
I do it for kicks
And it's a habit that sticks
I do it for kicks
And it's a habit that sticks
I do it for kicks
And it's a habit that sticks
Well, the things that are possible, you never say you dare
I've even sliced the cake, so you're on the take
You do what you wanna
I do what I wanna do
'Cause I do it for kicks
And it's a habit that sticks
I do it for kicks
And it's a habit that sticks
Well, I do it for kicks
And it's a habit that sticksEmbed
