Dope For Guns LyricsThe newspaper headlines got it wrong
They try to tell us that dope was too strong
But it ain't dope that threatens youth
They're selling dope for guns, that's the truth
Dope for guns, it ain't fun
Put you on your knees for the Lebanese
Whichever way you please, you're on your knees
Dope for guns, dope for guns
No one suspected but you had elected
Some foreign power but it turned sour
So shoot down your victim, you can't miss him
He's a rung on the ladder for a higher status
Dope for guns, it ain't fun
Put you on your knees for the Lebanese
Whichever way you please, you're on your knees
Dope for guns, dope for guns
Put you on your knees
For the Lebanese
Put you on your knees
Shoot down your victim, you can't miss him
He's a rung on the ladder for a higher status
Well, no one suspected but you elected
Some foreign power but it turned sour
Dope for guns, it ain't fun
Put you on your knees for the Lebanese
Whichever way you please, you're on your knees
Dope for guns, dope for guns
Dope for guns
Dope for guns
Dope for guns
Dope for guns...Embed
