Jah War LyricsThe air was thick with a smell of oppression
The militants joined with angry position
The tension tight with the strain of repression
Young blood boiling hot with agression
Jah war fighting fighting
Jah war, too close frightening
The winds were blowing and stirring up reaction
A storm broke out a militant action
Hot heads came in uniform
Thunder and lightning in a violent form
Jah war fighting fighting
Jah war, too close frightening
Solo
Jah war fighting fighting
Jah war, too close frightening
The air etc
Jah war fighting fighting
Jah war, too close frightening
Fighting fighting Jah war
Too close frightening jah War
Fighting fighting Jah war
Too close frightening jah War
Clarence Baker
No trouble maker
Said the truncheon came down
Knocked him to the ground
See the blood on the streets that day
The blood and the madness
See the blood on the streets that day
....Hey
Fighting fighting Jah war
Fighting fighting Jah war
Fighting fighting Jah war
Fighting fighting Jah warEmbed
