Below The House LyricsWhere does your love lay?
Below the house?
Growing in the darkness
(my love my love my love my love)
Amongst the dirt
Amongst the dust
(my love my love my love my love)
Hidden from the world
(my love my love my love my love)
My love it surely waits
(my love my love my love my love)Embed
