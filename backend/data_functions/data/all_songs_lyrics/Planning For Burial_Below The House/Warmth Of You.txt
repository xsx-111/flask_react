Warmth Of You Lyrics
The warmth of you
The warmth in you
Through and through
Didn't want to leave it
Couldn't bear to leave
I tried
I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried

I wanted you
Thought I needed you
Pain and all
Couldn't stand the distance
Couldn't stand the distance
Though I tried
I tried, I tried, I tried, I triedEmbed
