Feel Like Rain LyricsAnd we feel like rain when the words all sound the same
In the lifeless corners of this empty frame
Though we feel let down by the same old autumn breathing
And winter's curse is just around the bend
With our hands all tied to the blades of their design
We are armed and ready to commit this crime
We love that game but we never play
'Cause we will lose and we wanna stay
The way we are, the way we've been
For far too long
From the falsest smile to the fear of death is why
The pain reminds us that we're still alive
With our hopes on hold and our lack of interest exposed
All hands damage our determined eyes
But the lines are drawn and the red begins to creep
Its way from boredom toward apathy
We love that game but we never play
'Cause we will lose and we wanna stay
The way we are, the way we've been
For far too long
We love that game but we never play
'Cause we will lose and we wanna stay
The way we are, the way we've been
For far too long
Say something finally, we're alone
Alright, is there anyone out there at all?
Say something finally, we're alone
How about a phone call now?
We love that game but we never play
'Cause we will lose and we wanna stay
The way we are, the way we've been
For far too long
We love that game but we never play
'Cause we will lose and we wanna stay
The way we are, the way we've been
For far too long
We love that game but we never play
'Cause we will lose and we wanna stay
The way we are
And we feel like rain when the words all sound the same
As the curtain closes on another dayEmbed
