Invisible Monsters LyricsWoah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Are you listening at all?
Woah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Are you listening to anything I said?
It's hard to believe I cannot exist without you
As hard as I've tried, I cannot confess completely, yeah
These words were not meant to induce acts of likewise behavior (behavior)
It's just part of the curse I'm just trying to stay alive
Woah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Are you listening at all?
Woah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Are you listening to anything I said?
It's hard to admit, my weaknesses can consume me
I search for the cure in the bottles of varied volumes, yeah
The joke of it is I express myself without purpose (A purpose for living)
Yet you devour my small bits of madness and make believe
Woah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Are you listening at all?
Woah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Are you listening to anything I said?
If I can pretend, I don't depend
I can deny, deny denial
Yet when push comes to shove, and all the above I decide to live the lie
Woah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Are you listening at all?
Woah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Can you hear me?
Woah, Woah, Can you hear me?
Woah, Woah, Can you hear me?
Woah, Woah, Are you out there?
Woah, Woah, Are you listening to anything I said?Embed
