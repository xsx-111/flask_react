Hangman LyricsFed up with "made you look"
And dirty crooks without a clue
They all wear the same face
And it says, "Hangman, I'm onto you"

Hangman, it's not your fault
Commit this to memory
The bright ideas
Always get lost along the way
Last call for medicine
To count me in and turn me loose
I never meant to hide anything
But I'll never tell the truth

Commit this to memory, commit this to memory
Commit this to memory, commit this to memory
Commit this to memory, commit this to memory
Commit this to memory

I'm just a guy that never tried
I'm just a stupid fuck with brilliant luck and sometimes a bright idea
So shower me in a chorus of compliments and verse I don't deserve
I might run but I'll never hide
Hey, that's not right
You can't complain
"Everything's gonna be just fine"
Said the pen to the dotted line
If memory serves
Then mark my words
This game's called "catch me if you can"
And with wine will salute all our bitterness
Fed up with "made you look"
And dirty crooks without a clue
They all wear the same face
And it says, "Hangman I'm onto you"1Embed
