Make Out Kids Lyrics
They carve the message deep within our broken hearts that fail to mend
Make out kids never had a chance to be best friends

She's into math and magazines
Director's cuts and gray cell green
Armed with an eye for contradictions
She sees completely through me

I'm fond of Twin Peaks afternoons
Inexpensive wine with cordon bleu
Armed with a plethora of insecurities
We keep each other amused
And we sing:

Hooray for the madness, we are better by design
Let's hope we'll never have to say goodbye
Say goodbye

Snowed in sleep over winter break
Cocktails and miniature mistakes
Lights out, we're covered in each others' warm embrace..
And we sing:
 x2
Hooray for the madness, we are better by design
Let's hope we'll never have to say goodbye
Say goodbye
If we keep swimming, maybe this will never die (never die)

We fail to keep in touch these days
I'm liquid cold, she's murder grey
Hollowed by circumstance that pushed us both away

They carved a message deep within our broken hearts that failed to mend
Make out kids never had a chance to be best friendsEmbed
