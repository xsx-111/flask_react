Time Turned Fragile LyricsTiny hands, recycled cans, the metal bands I could not stand
The time you cried and threw your crayons across the floor
These are the things I think about when I'm alone without you
I wonder of your whereabouts and hope like hell you're happy where you are
You used to say that you're just fine
But I still wonder all the time
Hockey games, medical claims, police reports, terrible grades
J, I'm so proud of all the things that you have done
These are the things I think about when I'm alone without you
I wonder of your whereabouts and hope like hell you're happy where you are
I'm alright, I'm alright
I can see through everything you say, and all the lessons I never learned..
You used to say that you're just fine
But I still wonder all the time
Do you still believe in the stories told
To you by my friends and I when you were four years old?
How it got so cold that words just froze
We had to wait 'til summer to find out what was said
One of the best times that we had
I know I say that I'm just fine
But I hope you wonder from time to time
I was nervous from the start that our muscles might tear us apart
(Are muscles tearing us apart?)
From the words that carve our lives to the words that take us by surprise
(I was never taken by surprise.)
From the sounds that disappear to the changes we begin to fear
(I can hear you clearly.)
One day I'll fail to breathe and all you'll have are memories
(All we are are memories.)1Embed
