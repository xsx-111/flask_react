Hold Me Down Lyrics
I found a letter that said:
"I'm sorry that you were asleep when I wrote these words down
You'd think I'd ought to be used to that by now
Save for a few of those late night episodes
Missed opportunities, and I don't cares,
There's not a lot that I feel obliged to share or talk about"

I'll have my brother stop by this Saturday
To pick up my things just make sure you're not there
This may sound bad, and don't take it the wrong way
I love you, however

You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down

You're the echoes of my everything
You're the emptiness the whole world sings at night
You're the laziness of afternoon
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloom
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
Cancel our dinner with Max and Coraline
Feed Jacky's gerbil and try to stay clean
We'll talk it over after I've had some time
Alone to sort it out

You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down

You're the echoes of my everything
You're the emptiness the whole world sings at night
You're the laziness of afternoon
You're the reason why I burst and why I bloom
You're the leaky sink of sentiment
You're the failed attempts I never could forget
You're all the metaphors I can't create
To comprehend this curse that I call love
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?
How will I break the news to you?1Embed
