Resolution LyricsI like the universe, but she messes with my words
I'm not talking planets or galaxies and
The distance just makes it worse
I know what you're thinking, this probably sounds rehearsed
So let's give it up for the New Year
Did this party of two have you slightly confused?
Now that our things are divided
She refuses to speak and I'm driftin' to sleep at the wheel
Liquids, powders and pills, not quite taken against my will
The tastes test of girls, from all over the world
Who refuse to accept my excuses
She put up with so much of my madness and my self-abuse
She would tend to my wounds and fill me with food when I'd stumble in drunk for breakfast
She was right to take off before she was consumed
So let's give it up for the New Year
Did this party of two have you slightly confused?
Now that our things are divided
She refuses to speak and I'm driftin' to sleep at the wheel

I like the universe, but she messes with my words
I'm not talking planets or galaxies and
The distance just makes it worse
You're totally right, every action was well rehearsedEmbed
