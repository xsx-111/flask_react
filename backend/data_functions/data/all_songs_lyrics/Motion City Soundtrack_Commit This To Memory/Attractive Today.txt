Attractive Today LyricsI am wrecked, I am overblown
I am also fed up with the common cold
But I just hate to say goodbye to all the metaphors and lies
That have taken me years to come up with
Say it's true, say you like me (I like you)
Just for the night, for me it's been eternity
And as I gently sip this drink, I think about my lack of future
And all the places I could learn to fall in love
I know I shouldn't waste my time
Wishing I'd been better designed
Yet for some reason, still think
I am wrecked, I am overblown
I am also fed up with the fucking common cold
When I just want to feel alive for the first time in my life
I just want to feel attractive today2Embed
