With Teeth Lyrics
She comes along
She gets inside
She makes you better than
Anything you've tried
It's in her kiss
The blackest sea
And it runs deeper than you
Dare to dream it could be

With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth

Wave goodbye
To what you were
The rules have changed
The lines begin to blur
She makes you hard
It comes on strong
You've finally found
The place where you belong
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth

I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again
I cannot go through this again

With teeth
With teeth
With teeth
With teeth

She will not let you go
Keeps holding on
She will not let you go
Keeps holding on
This time, I'm not coming back
She will not let you go
This time, I'm not coming back
She will not let you go2Embed
