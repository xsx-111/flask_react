Getting Smaller Lyrics
Getting a little erratic here
And I don't know who to trust
I guess they got a way of reading my mind
I guess I got to adjust
I've got my arms that flip flop flip flop flip
I got my head on a spring
Well I thought I got you on my side
I haven't got fucking anything

I'm just a face in the crowd
Nothing to worry about
Not even trying to stand out
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
And I got nothing to say
It's all been taken away
I just behave and obey
I'm afraid I am starting to fade away

Uh huh
I kind of see through the cracks
When I press up on the wall
I'm not looking to stand up real high
I'd be happy to crawl
I think I'm losing my grip
But I can still make a fist
You know I still got my one good arm
That I can beat
I can beat myself up with
I'm just a face in the crowd
Nothing to worry about
Not even trying to stand out
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller
And I got nothing to say
It's all been taken away
I just behave and obey
I'm afraid I am starting to fade away

Hey, and for what it was worth
I really used to believe
That maybe there's some great thing
That we could achieve
And now I can't tell the difference
Or know what to feel
Between what I've been trying so hard to see
And what appears to be real

Fading away
Fading away
Fading away
Fading away
My world is getting smaller everyday
Hey hey hey hey, and that's okay
My world is getting smaller everyday
Hey hey hey hey, and that's okay
My world is getting smaller everyday
Hey hey hey hey, and that's okay
My world is getting smaller everyday
Hey hey hey hey, and that's okay6Embed
