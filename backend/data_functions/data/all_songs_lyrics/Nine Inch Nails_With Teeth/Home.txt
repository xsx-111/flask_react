Home Lyrics
Everything
Is catching up with me
I awake
To find I'm not at all where I
Should be
And it feels
I'm getting to the end
And it's hard
To figure out what's real, and what's
Pretend

To break from what we're tied to
God knows how much I've tried to

And I am still inside you
And I am still inside you

I escape
Every now and then
And to think
I find myself back here again
And again
I used to know who I was
Until you came along
I return
To the only place I've ever felt
That I belong
To break from what we're tied to
God knows how much I've tried to

And I am still inside you
And I am still inside you1Embed
