Every Day Is Exactly the Same Lyrics
I believe I can see the future
'Cause I repeat the same routine
I think I used to have a purpose
Then again, that might have been a dream
I think I used to have a voice
Now I never make a sound
I just do what I've been told
I really don't want them to come around
Oh no

Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain
Every day is exactly the same

I can feel their eyes are watching
In case I lose myself again
Sometimes I think I'm happy here (Sometimes)
Sometimes, yet I still pretend
I can't remember how this got started, oh
But I can tell you exactly how it will end

Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain
Every day is exactly the same
I'm writing on a little piece of paper
I'm hoping someday you might find
Well I'll hide it behind something
They won't look behind
I am still inside
A little bit comes bleeding through
I wish this could've been any other way
But I just don't know, I don't know
What else I can do

Every day is exactly the same
Every day is exactly the same
There is no love here and there is no pain (Every day)
Every day is exactly the same (Exactly the same, Every day)
Every day is exactly the same (Every day)
Every day is exactly the same (There is no pain)
There is no love here and there is no pain (Every day)
Every day is exactly the same (Every day is the same)16Embed
