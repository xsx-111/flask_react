Beside You in Time Lyrics
I am all alone this time around
Sometimes on the side I hear a sound
Places parallel I know it's you
Feel the little pieces bleeding through

And on (And on)
This goes on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
This goes on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on

Now that I've decided not to stay
I can feel me start to fade away
Everything is back where it belongs
I will be beside you before long
And on (And on)
This goes on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
This goes on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on (And on)
And on

Ooo we will never die
Ooo beside you in time
Ooo we will never die
Ooo beside you in timeEmbed
