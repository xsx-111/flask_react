You Know What You Are? Lyrics
I tried to sneak myself through, tried to get to the other side
(I tried to sneak myself through, tried to get to the other side)
I had to patch up the cracks and the holes that I have to hide
For a little bit of time even made it work okay
Just long enough to really make it hurt
When they figured me out and it all just rotted away

Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on get back to where you belong

You better take a good look cause I'm full of shit
With every bit of my heart I've tried to believe in it
You can dress it all up, you can try to pretend
But you can't change anything
You can't change anything
In the end

Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on get back to where you belong
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are
Remember where you came from, remember what you are

Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on get back to where you belong
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on get back to where you belong
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on get back to where you belong
Don't you fucking know what you are?
Go on get back to where you belong3Embed
