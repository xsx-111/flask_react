Back Pack LyricsYou were dead
By the time that I had found you
Your blood was spilled
On the couch where we had first kissed
So I carried you West
To the sea, so I could wash you
Your body felt just like a backpack
And I don’t know what they did to your face
And I don’t like it
You lived large
Till the day they finally caught you
They cut out your tongue so you would not scream
When you came to
And you pissed blood
And then they chained you up when you turned blue
Your body felt just like a t-shirt
And I wanna build a tower
To all the nicer things you could have been
But I don’t like it
You were dead
By the time that I had found you1Embed
