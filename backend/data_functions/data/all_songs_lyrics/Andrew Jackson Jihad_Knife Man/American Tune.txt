American Tune Lyrics
I am white
And I've got everything I need
No one clutches their purses when they're in a room alone with me
And I can drive through any neighborhood I please
At any hour, and the police don't do a thing

So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight white male in America
I've got all the luck I need

I'm a guy getting paid more than a girl with a degree
And I can walk down the streets after dark
No one wants to rape me
And I can get a girl pregnant
And just as easily flee
Just like my straight white male dad did to me

So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
I've got a pile of broken mirrors
And I'm walking under ladders
And I'm spilling tons of salt because to me that doesn't matter
Because my skin and my gender and my orientation
Are the best things to have when you live in this nation
I recommend it highly

So if I see a penny on the ground
I leave it alone or fucking flip it
I'm a straight white male in America
I've got all the luck I need
Shit's going to work out for me
I'm a straight white male in America
I've got all the luck I need3Embed
