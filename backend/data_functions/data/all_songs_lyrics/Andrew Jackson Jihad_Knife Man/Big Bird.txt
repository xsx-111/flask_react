Big Bird Lyrics
I'm afraid of the way that I live my life
I'm afraid of the way I don't
I'm afraid of the things that I wanna do but I won't
I'm afraid of God
I'm afraid to believe
And I'm afraid of all the loved ones that I made leave
I'm afraid that my dog doesn't love me anymore
I'm afraid of the social laziness that let Kitty Genovese die
And I'm afraid of the mob mentality
That makes otherwise normal people go blind
I'm afraid of the way the world works
And I'm afraid of the words in my notebooks
I'm afraid that you all know that I am a pervert

But the Big Red Bird that lives under the city
Doesn't give a damn about me
And it dies every night
By burning alive

I'm afraid of my grandfather's cancer
And I'm afraid of my mom's dying arm
I'm afraid that I've somehow caused my family harm
I'm afraid that the ones I love won't have enough
I'm afraid that the ones I love won't have enough
It's harder to be yourself
Than it is to be anybody else
I wish I were a little less of a coward
But the Big Red Bird that lives under the city
Doesn't give a damn about me
And it dies every night
So I bought a knife
I am a knife
I am a Knife Man8Embed
