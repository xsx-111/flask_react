Hate, Rain on Me LyricsI wish I had a bullet big enough to fucking kill the sun
I'm sick of songs about the summer
And I hate everyone
I'm gonna load my rifle, gonna aim it at the dying star
I wanna live in a bubble
I need a getaway car
Hate, rain on me
Hate, rain on me
How can I be someone that you love
If you hate me?
And how can I be someone you respect
If you call me lazy?
I've got to get out of my skin
But I don't know where to begin
And right now I feel worthless
And I feel crazy
Hate, rain on me
Hate, rain on me
I wanna put on my sweatpants
You know I'm trying to quit
I want to give a shit again
I wanna put on my sweatpants
But don't you know I'm trying to quit
I want to give a shit again
Hate, rain on
Hate, rain on
Hate, rain on me
Hate, rain on
Hate, rain on
Hate, rain on me2Embed
