No One LyricsWho do you call on when you have no one?
Who do you call on
When you have no one?
This might not be nice to say
But I'll say it anyway
When you have no one
You are no one
I used to work at the people pound
I used to watch them line up
Some sleeping on the ground
Their diabetic bellies gleaming, fat and round
When you have no one
You are no one
Like I said, I used to work at the people pound
All these no ones put together
Just like a human lost and found
If they let them all be someones
There wouldn't be enough to go around
It's better for us all that there are no ones
And I knew a lot of no ones 'round that time
They used to all be someones until something took their life
And all of their someones disappeared while they're stuck waiting in a line
And for them now, no one seems to have the time
I knew someone who had a disease
And it took away all that mattered
His brain and dignity
And I tried my best to fight it off, to try to set him free
Now that someone is no one to me
Who do you call on when you have no one?
Who do you call on when you have no one?
This might not be nice to say
But I'll say it anyways
When you have no one
You are no one
And it takes no one to know one1Embed
