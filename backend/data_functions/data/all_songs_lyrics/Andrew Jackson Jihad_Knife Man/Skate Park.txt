Skate Park Lyrics
The skate park is only fifteen Minutemen songs away
And there's nothing I would rather do on this terrible fucking day
Than break, break, break my bones
And feel the pain of self-improvementâ€‹

It's not your job to make everybody happy
You don't have to answer to anyone or anybody

Just stick, stick, stick to your guns
And don't quit until you feel like changing them

And it's a sin and a shame
To keep yourself from knowing
The things that make you beautiful and complete
When we lie to ourselves
We can feel our insides rotting
When the world should be bowing at our feet
At our feet

Stick, stick, stick to your guns
And don't quit until you feel like changing them
Stick, stick, stick to your guns
And don't quit until you feel like changing them
Stick, stick, stick to your guns
And don't quit until you feel like changing themEmbed
