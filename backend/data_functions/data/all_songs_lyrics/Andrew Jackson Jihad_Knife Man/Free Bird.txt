Free Bird Lyrics
There's a tongue in my mouth
There's a lock on the door
And I can't imagine wishing for more
I've paid for my crimes and I've unlied my lies
And now I'm adorned with a clever disguise

I'm free as a bird
I'm free from my words

There is a pill I've been meaning to swallow
And it's shaped like a record
That I'd love to borrow
And covered in shit I've been meaning to wallow in
I don't know where I'll be tomorrow

I'm free as a bird
I'm free from my words
I'm free as a bird flying over the sea who just can't find the summer

If there's a God in the sky or a Devil below
That doesn't matter to me
'Cause I see Satan's face when I look in the mirror
I see God inside all of the people I meet
I am free as a bird
I'm free from my words
I'm free as a man who's out wandering the streets, looking for shelterEmbed
