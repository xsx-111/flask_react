Distance Lyrics
The first month after you left
I drank and jerked off till I slept
I went to work when I had to
And then came home
I fed the dog when I had to
I fed myself when I had to
Went out of town when I had to
And then came home

And I know this won't last forever
But god damn it, it feels like forever
Since we've been together
Till we'll be together again

The second month after you left
I still felt real depressed
But I've got plenty of other things to spend my time on
I hate whiny fuckin' songs like this
But I can't afford a therapist
Sorry guys, here's a solo

And it's harder to be yourself
Than it is to be anybody else
I wish that I were someone closer to you

And I know this won't last forever
But god damn it, it feels like forever
Since we've been together
Till we'll be together again
