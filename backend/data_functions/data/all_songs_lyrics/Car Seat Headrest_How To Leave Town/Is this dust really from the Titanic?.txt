Is this dust really from the Titanic? LyricsThe cool thing about having a lot of artist friends
Is getting to see a lot of unreleased or unfinished work being tossed around casually
As if it was just another average part of their life
Since, obviously, for them, it is
At the same time, though, even though these artists will share this stuff with you freely if you're
As they say, "in the know"
You get the feeling that they wouldn't want it to be seen this way to the larger audience they're creating for
As something that can be placed into the context of a life

The shitty thing about having artist friends is getting into the front seat of their car and having to rest your feet on fast food burger wrappers and empty Gatorade bottles
It's depressing to realize that these people that you've thought had a much better hold on life than you don't really have their shit together. At least, not in the normal sense. And if I'm being honest, it does kind of matter. Apparently, it's impossible to be an artist and not have puked-in car cup holders. I'm not excluding myself from this
