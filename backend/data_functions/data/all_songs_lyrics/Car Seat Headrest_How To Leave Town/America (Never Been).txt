America (Never Been) Lyrics
You can drive across the whole thing
In four days
If you really wanted
Leaving custom thank you notes
In all the houses
You ever haunted
In this whole solar system
We've only met one type of life
It's the living kind of life
And it's not one I recognize

America
America
America
America
America
America
America
America
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
I said "excuse me" to the ocean
Because I thought I had got in its way
At first, I didn't think it heard me
But then I saw it wave
You can spend every living moment thinking
How can I get out alive?
But is it really then, can you really call it
Hey man, just shut up and drive
I thought we'd be on the road all night
When that ice storm hit in Texas
And when we pulled into the gas station
It was like a frozen oasis

Oh, sweet mama, does that neon sign shine for me?
Is there a street where my name glows all through the night?

And I've never read (America)
No, I've never been (America)
I just never went (America)
I have never seen (America)
And I've never wrote (America)
I have never been (America)
No, I never spoke (America)
All I want to see (America)
All my fantasies are faking orgasms
They're only in it for the money I made up for them
I trade in ideas, opinions, and artistry
And my face is on every dollar
This is heaven but heaven is here
(This is heaven but heaven is here)
This is heaven but heaven is hard
(This is heaven but heaven is hard)
Because your lover is listening to music you don't know
And you're tangled up in the headphone wires
You know our problems, they don't end
Just because we get boy/girlfriends
Is this your salvation plan?
Is this your salvation plan?

There's only one type of love
It's the loving kind of love
But when you're mad at me it's the end of times
And I'm mad at you all the other times

Have I ever really (been in love)?
I guess I've never really (been in love)
Have I ever really (been in love)?
Not in the way I'm thinking (been in love)
Haven't really (been in love)?
I've just never really (been in love)
Oh, have I ever really (been in love)?
No no, I've never really (been in love)
Real life's a mess
But at least you're not paying rent
You've been making it, maybe even breaking even
You oughta be content
It doesn't make sense
You're still sitting on the fence
When the yard is yours
And it was money well spent

And I've never read (America)
No, I've never been (America)
I just never went (America)
I have never seen (America)
America (America)
America (America)
Democracy (America)
Biographies (America)

Civil rights! Basically (America)
Bright lights! Living in the city (America)
Second prize in a beauty pageant (America)
200 dollars, this is life, this is your life! (America)
America! (America)
America! (America)
This is heaven (America)
I think that this is heaven! (America)
This is the place (America)
This is the place! (America)
This is the place! (America)
This is the place! (America)1Embed
