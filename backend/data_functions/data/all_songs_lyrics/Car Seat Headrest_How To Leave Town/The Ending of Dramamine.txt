The Ending of Dramamine Lyrics
The drunk's face breaks into sweat
As his friend falls under the wheels
But the headlights don't flinch
And the engine doesn't stutter
Oh yeah
Think about myself
I think about myself
Care about myself
I care about myself
I only care about myself
And other fears too stupid to mention
The ending of "Dramamine" scared Degnan
The way that you all see me
That's who I am, but not who I need to be
Moving my joke body
Through the cold November night
Haha
Hate yourself
Do you hate yourself?
I don't hate myself
I tolerate myself
I wish I was someone else
But it seems too stupid to mention
I know I'll be ripped in heaven

I was young, I was thin
I had money and I loved you
But then came the shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
I need a name for what I'm feeling
Then I can start to work on a meaning
Speaking of the shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah

In a crowded room you will
Hear your own opinion voiced
You can sit back without a word
Watch it spread or fall silent
Oh yeah
If it's too late to speak
I could get out of bed
Find a pencil and write
Leave it for you to find
If the moment is gone
To say I figured out what the problem was
I'd been thinking about it earlier
Hey! Can you hear me now?
Am I alone in my futile efforts?
Sometimes I get so mad
I can't do the few things I usually can
Which is sad
Occupying space
I know I take up space
Will there be a space
For my soul in space?
That's heaven to me

And now I'm young, and I'm thin
I have money and I love you
But here comes the shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
(Thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon)
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
(Thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon)
I need a name for what I'm feeling
Then I can start to work on a meaning
Speaking of the shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
(Thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon)
Shabba de bop bop be shibby day, oh yeah
(Thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon)
And in the sky, there is a place
Where it's warm, and you're there
And I've got the power now
Yeah, I know what to do
To make you feel something besides pain
'Cause it's the love
That we've come to expect, to deserve
And then we fuck and it's nice
It's not a complicated mess
And my back doesn't hurt
And your head doesn't tell you to kill yourself
So we smile and embrace
Until we don't know who we are

I can't hear a thing now
I guess I belong to me now
But when night fell on Montana
I found a rest stop completely deserted
But I still felt the eyes upon me
So I drove away
(Thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon)
(Thanks for fucking with my head, come again soon)10Embed
