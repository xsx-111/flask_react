After Me LyricsThere's a line on her jeans, that a ballpoint made
From a careless mistake, that she can't wash away
And there's a heart on her sleeve, from a spill of red wine
There's a piece of green in the blue of her eyes
She named it after me
There's a stay dog she feeds, that she found in the street
And he loves her to hold him, but he won't let her keep him
And he claws at the door to be let out at night
And she makes do without him, and she worries about him
She named him after me
So if you ever decide, that you have to escape
And travel the world, and you can't find a place
Well, you could wind up believin'
That paradise is nothin' more than a feelin'
That goes on in your mind
So if you ever find out what that is
There's somethin' you could do
'Cause if I ever hold that golden dream again
I want to tell you I'm gonna name it after youEmbed
