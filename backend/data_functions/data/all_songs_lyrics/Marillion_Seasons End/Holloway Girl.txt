Holloway Girl LyricsI was out in the cold of a north london street
A cog in the hurrying world
Above the walls and the gate police
I caught a glimpse of a Holloway girl
She was reachin' out of a window
From a space just a few inches wide
'till the hand of justice pulled her back inside
One day, freedom will unlock your door
Hold on. Believe on
Be who you were before
One day, freedom will unlock your door
I know how hard it can be to wait
For proof you were right all along
Self destruction is easy for you
We know what you're capable of
But like a needle in a haystack
The truth gets so disguised
In a kingdom built on madness and on lies
One day, freedom will unlock your door
So hold on. Believe on
Be who you were before
In deepest darkness
The faintest light shines bright
So hold on, hold on
It's gonna be alright
You're lookin' up at a mountain
Between you and the outside
But there isn't a mountain in this whole world
Hasn't been climbed
One day, freedom will unlock your door
So hold on. Believe on
Be who you were before
In deepest darkness, the faintest light shines bright
So hold on. Hold on
It's gonna be alright
One day, freedom
One day, freedom
One day, freedom will unlock your doorEmbed
