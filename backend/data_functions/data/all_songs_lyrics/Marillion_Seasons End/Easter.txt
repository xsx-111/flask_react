Easter LyricsA ghost of a mist was on the field
The grey and the green together
The noise of a distant farm machine
Out of the first light came
A tattered necklace of hedge and trees
On the southern side of the hill
Betrays where the border runs between
Where Mary Dunoon's boy fell
Easter here again
A time for the blind to see
Easter
Surely now can all of your hearts be free
Out of the port of Liverpool
Bound for the north of Ireland
The wash of the spray and horsetail waves
The roll of the sea below
And Easter here again
A time for the blind to see
Easter
Surely now can all of your hearts be free
What will you do?
Make a stone of your heart?
Will you set things right
When you tear them apart?
Will you sleep at night
With the plough and the stars alight?
What will you do?
With the wire and the gun?
That'll set things right
When it's said and done?
Will you sleep at night?
Is there so much love to hide?
Forgive
Forget
Sing 'never again'1Embed
