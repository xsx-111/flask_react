Hold On To Yourself LyricsI'm so far away from you
I'm pacing up and down my room
Does Jesus only love a man who loses?
I turn on the radio
There's some cat on the saxophone
Laying down a litany of excuses
There's madhouse longing in my baby's eyes
She rubs a lamp between her thighs
And hopes the genie comes out singing
And she lives in some forgotten song
And moves like she is zombie-strong
Breathes steady as the pendulum keeps swinging
You better hold on to yourself
Well, cities rust and fall to ruin
Factories close and cars go cruising
In and around the borders of her vision
She says oh woah woah woah
As Jesus makes the flowers grow
All around the scene of her collision
Oh you know, yes, I would
I would hold on to yourself
In the middle of the night
I try my best to chase outside
The phantoms and the ghosts and the fairy-girls
On 1001 nights like this
She mutters open sesame and Ali Baba and his forty thieves
Launch her off the face of the world
Well, you know
Oh baby, I'll come back
And I'll hold on to yourself
Babe, I'm 1000 miles away
And I just don't know what to say
Cause Jesus only loves a man who bruises
But darling we can clearly see
It's all life and fire and lunacy
And excuses and excuses and excuses
Well, you know if I could I would
Yeah, I would lie right down
And I'd hold on to yourself
Yeah, I would lie right down
And I would hold on to yourself
One day I'll come back to you
And I'll hold on to yourself
Yeah, I'm gonna come back
Gonna lie down
And I'll hold on to yourself2Embed
