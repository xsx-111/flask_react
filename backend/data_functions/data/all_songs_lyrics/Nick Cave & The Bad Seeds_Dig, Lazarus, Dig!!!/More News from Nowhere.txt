More News from Nowhere LyricsI walk into the corner of my room
See my friends in high places
I don't know which is which or who is whom
They've stolen each other's faces
Janet is there with her high head and hair
Full of bedroom feathers
Janet is known to make dead men groan
In any kind of weather
I crawl over to her
I say hey baby
I say hey Janet
You are the one, you are the sun
And I'm your dutiful planet
But she ain't down with any of that
Cause she's heard that shit before
And I say uh huh, oh yeah you're right
Cause I see Betty X standing by the door
With more news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere
And it's getting strange in here
Yeah it's getting stranger every year
More news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere
Alright now
Now Betty X is like Betty Y minus that fatal chromosome
Her hair is like the wine dark sea in which sailors come home
I say hey baby I say hey Betty X
I lean close up to her throat
This light you are carrying is like a lamp
Hanging from a distant boat
It is my light says Betty X
Betty X says this light ain't yours
And so much wind blew through her words
That I went rolling down the hall
For more news from nowhere
More news from nowhere, uh huh huh
And it's strange in here
Yeah it gets stranger every year
More news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere, uh huh huh
I turn another corner
I go down a corridor
And I see this guy
He must be about one hundred foot tall
And he only has one eye
He asks me for my autograph
I write nobody and then
I wrap myself up in my woolly coat
And I blind him with my pen
Cause someone must have stuck something in my drink
Everything's getting strange lookin'
Half the people have turned into squealing pigs
The other half are cooking
Well let me out of here I cried
And I went pushing past
And I saw Miss Polly singing with some girls
I cried, "Strap me to the mast"
For more news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere, uh huh huh
It's getting strange in here
And it gets stranger every year
More news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere
Well then a black girl with no clothes on
She danced across the room
We charted the progress of the planets
Around that boogie woogie moon
I called her my nubian princess
Gave her some sweet back fatass jive
Spent the next seven years between her legs
A-pining for my wife
But then by and by it all went wrong
I fell washed up on a shore
She stared down at me from up in the storm
And I sopped up on the floor
For more news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere uh huh huh
And don't it make you feel alone
Don't it make you wanna get right on home
More news from nowhere
More news from nowhere, let me hear it now
Well here comes Elena with two black eyes
She's given herself a transfusion
She's filled herself with panda blood
To avoid all the confusion
I say the sun rises and falls with you
And various things about love
But a rising violence in me cuts all my circuits off
Well Elena she starts screaming
Her cheeks are full of psychotropic leaves
Her extinction was nearly absolute
When she turned her back on me
For more news from nowhere
I said more news from nowhere
And it's getting strange in here
Yeah it gets stranger every year
More news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere
Alright
Alright
I bump and crash into Deanna
Hanging pretty in the door frame
All the horrors that have befallen me
Well Deanna is to blame
Every time I see you baby
You make me feel so unalone
And I wipe my face into her dress
Long after she'd gone home
With more news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere
And don't it make you feel alone
Yeah and don't it make you wanna get right back home
More news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere
Alright
And don't it make you feel so sad
Don't the blood rush to your feet
To think that everything you do today
Tomorrow is obsolete
Technology and women
And little children too
Don't it make you feel blue
Don't it make you feel blue
For more news from nowhere
With more news from nowhere
Don't it make you feel alone
Yeah and don't it make you wanna get right back home
More news from nowhere
Yeah more news from nowhere
One last time
Well I gotta say
Yeah I gotta say
Goodbye
Goodbye
