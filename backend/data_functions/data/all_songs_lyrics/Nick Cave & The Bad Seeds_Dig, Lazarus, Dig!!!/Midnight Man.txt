Midnight Man LyricsHold that chrysalis in your palm
See it split and change
It won't do you any harm
It's just trying to rearrange
It was born to live a day
Now it flies up from your hand
It's beautiful
It's the one they call
Your ever-loving man
Wolves have carried your babies away
O your kids drip from their teeth
The nights are long and the day
Is bitter cold beyond belief
You spread yourself like a penitent
On the mad vibrating sand
And through your teeth
Arrange to meet
Your midnight man
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around!
O baby don't you see
Everybody wants to be
Your midnight man
Don't disturb me as I sleep
Treat me gentle when I wake
And don't disturb me as I sleep
Even though your body aches
Even though your body aches
To serve at his command
Between the walls
She still adores
Her ever-loving man
Close your eyes, sleep in him
Dream of your lost sons and daughters
Me, I'll raise up my dorsal fin
And glide up and down the waters
I'll glide up and down the waters
Then I'll walk upon the land
And I'll call 'em out
The ones who doubt
Your midnight man
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around!
Don't did you see
Everybody wanna be
Your midnight man
It's early in the morning
And I don't know what to do
It's early in the morning
And I can't believe it's true
As I lay in the moment
And it's happening again
Well, I called you once, I called you twice
Ain't I your midnight man
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around to my place!
Everybody's coming around!
They want you, they love you, they need you
To be, your midnight man
Everybody's coming here
Everybody's coming here
Everybody's coming here
To be your midnight man
To be your midnight manEmbed
