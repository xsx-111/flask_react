Our Favorite Recording Session Lyrics
Hey hey come in they come
O.k. boys, take one
Danny and the Juniors set a groove stuck them blblblblu shoot
Say shoot
I should
Why don't you say "shoot" quick right as the song
Danny and the Juniors set a shoot stuck them down in the bloot, spoot
Fruit, toot
O.k. let's get ready
Let's dub, let's overdub a little a little finger 
No, no, no Clem no!
By greckins you put a little, little bit, a little finger popping on thar
It's going to be a million-and-two seller
Hey, will you take off that hat? You look like George Washington!
I'll throw you across the river
You'll throw me across? The what? The Pontiac?
I'll throw you across the river. I threw a silver dollar across, I can
Throw you
When you hear the countdown, everyone shut up because it's awful tight

Yeah
Let's make it
Sitting in my car
Say t-shirts
T-shirts in my car
Sorry
Outside your lawn
What's wrong?
I broke that tie thing
Oh thanks!
It's his tie thing
Gee whiz
I have another one, thank you
How much are they?
I have two more
You do not
I bought them for 99 cents a piece
You, You did?
I know where you can get them
Here we go
For 99 cents
We're on
You got a better deal than I did
I know
Is this mike on?
All the way from Hawthorne California we're flying over Carl Wilson who's
Going to jump 600 feet into a two foot cup
Into a damp rag
Come on
Hey look, I'm going to leave you home
Hey you guys just a second, I forgot my note
Just a second I'm going to go to the piano
O.k. let's make one Charlie
You guys ready, let's goEmbed
