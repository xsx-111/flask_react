Do You Remember Lyrics
Little Richard sang it and Dick Clark brought it to life
Danny and the Juniors hit a groove, stuck as sharp as a knife

Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll

Chuck Berry's got to be the greatest thing that's come along
(Hum diddy waddy, hum diddy wadda)
He made the guitar beats and wrote the all-time greatest song
(Hum diddy waddy, hum diddy wadda)

Well now do you remember all the guys that gave us rock and roll
(Hum diddy waddy doo)

Elvis Presley is the king
He's the giant of the day
Paved the way for the rock and roll stars
Yeah the critics kept a knocking
But the stars kept a rocking
And the chopping didn't get very far
Goodness gracious great balls of fire
Nothing's really moving until the saxophone's ready to blow
(Do you remember, do you remember)
And the beat's not jumping until the drummer says he's ready to go
(Do you remember, do you remember)

Let's hear the high voice wail (oooooooooo)
And hear the voice down low (wah-ah ah-ah)
Let's hear the background
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and roll
Um diddy wadda, Um diddy wadda
They gave us rock and rollEmbed
