Drive-In Lyrics
Ooo wah
Ooo wah

Everytime I have a date there's only one place to go
That's to the drive in
It's such a groovy place to talk and maybe watch a show
Down at the drive in
Forget about the plot, it'll do very well
But make sure you see enough so you're prepared to tell

About the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)

If the windows get fogged you'll have to take a breath
(Ooo waah ooo)
Down at the drive in
(Wah wah ooo)
Or the cat dressed in white will scare you both to death
Down at the drive in
A big buttered popcorn and an extra large coke
A few chili dogs and man I'm going broke
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
Yeah at the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)

Don't sneak your buddies in the trunk because they might get caught
By the drive in
(Wah wah wah ooo)
And they'd look kind of stupid getting chased through the lot
(Wah ooo)
Around the drive in

If you say you watch the movie you're a couple of liars
And "Remember only you can prevent forest fires"
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)Embed
