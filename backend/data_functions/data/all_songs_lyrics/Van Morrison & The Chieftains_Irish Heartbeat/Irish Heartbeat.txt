Irish Heartbeat Lyrics
Oh won't you stay
Stay awhile with your own ones
Don't ever stray
Stray so far from your own ones
For the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own ones

Don't rush away
Rush away from your own ones
One more day
One more day with your own ones
Yes the world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own ones

There's a stranger and he's standing at your door
Might be your best friend, might be your brother
You may never know

I'm going back
Going back to my own ones
Back to talk
Talk awhile with my own ones
This old world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own ones
This old world is so cold
Don't care nothing for your soul
You share with your own onesEmbed
