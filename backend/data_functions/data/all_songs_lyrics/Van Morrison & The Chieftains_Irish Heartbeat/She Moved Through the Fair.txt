She Moved Through the Fair LyricsMy young love said to me
My mother won't mind
And my father won't slight you
For your lack of kind
She stepped away from me
And this she did say
"It will not be long love
Till our wedding day"
She stepped away from me
And she moved through the fair
And fondly I watched her move here
And move there
And she went her way homeward
With one star awake
As the swan in the evening
Moved over the lake
Last night she came to me
My young love came in
So softly she entered
That her feet made no din
And she came close beside me
And this she did say
"It will not be long love
Till our wedding day"Embed
