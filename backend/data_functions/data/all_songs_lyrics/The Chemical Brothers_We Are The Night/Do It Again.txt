Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Oh my God, what have I done? (Do it again)
All I wanted was a little fun (Do it again)
Got a brain like bubblegum (Do it again)
Blowing up my cranium (Do it again)
Oh my God, what have I done? (Do it again)
All I wanted was a little fun (Do it again)
Got a brain like bubblegum (Do it again)
Blowing up my cranium (Do it again)

Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha

Oh my God, what have I done? (Do it again)
All I wanted was a little fun (Do it again)
Got a brain like bubblegum (Do it again)
Blowing up my cranium (Do it again)
Oh my God, what have I done? (Do it again)
All I wanted was a little fun (Do it again)
Got a brain like bubblegum (Do it again)
Blowing up my cranium (Do it again)
Turn off my robotic brain
All my thoughts are all the same
(All insane)

Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

Paint my face and bang my drum
Hold my bone up to the sun
Bang my drum and paint my face
On my plane to hyperspace

Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Oh my God, what have I done? (Do it again)
All I wanted was a little fun (Do it again)
Got a brain like bubblegum (Do it again)
Blowing up my cranium (Do it again)
Oh my God, what have I done? (Do it again)
All I wanted was a little fun (Do it again)
Got a brain like bubblegum (Do it again)
Blowing up my cranium (Do it again)

Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha
Ooh, yeah, ah-ha

Turn off my robotic brain
All my thoughts are all the same
(All insane)1Embed
