All Rights Reversed Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Heaven's down (oh)
And Hell is up (oh)
All rights reversed (oh, oh)
Proven by the planets and their movements (oh)
While down on earth (oh)
The primal chaos (oh)
Is pushing backwards (oh)
But even then the danger never stops

And no one's stopping
It never stops
And no one's stopping
It never stops
And no one's stopping
It never stops
And no one's stopping

Oh, oh, oh, oh
It never stops (oh)
And no one's stopping (oh)
All rights reversed (oh, oh)
Undertaking kopyleft while flying sideways (oh)
While down on earth (oh)
The primal chaos (oh)
Is pulling forward (oh)
And there are other threats below

It never stops
And no one's stopping
It never stops
And no one's stopping

It never stops
It never stops

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
Never stops
And no one's stopping
It never stops
And no one's stopping
It never stops
And no one's stopping
It never stops
And no one's stopping
It never stops
And no one's stoppingEmbed
