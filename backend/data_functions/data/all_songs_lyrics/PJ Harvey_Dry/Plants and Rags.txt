Plants and Rags Lyrics
Plants and rags
Ease myself into a body bag
Plants and rags
Ease myself into a body bag

Dreamt of a man
He fed me fine food
He gave me shiny things
I dreamt of a man
He fed me fine food
He gave me shiny things

White and black
You looking for the sun, boy?
The sun doesn't shine down here, no, no, no
White and black
You looking for the sun, boy?
The sun doesn't shine down here, in the shadows

House and home
Who thought they could take away that place?
Outside, and they lead us out quietly
Lead us outside, and the lead us out quietly
House and home
Who thought they could take away that place?
Outside, and they lead us out quietly
Lead us outside, and they lead us out quietly1Embed
