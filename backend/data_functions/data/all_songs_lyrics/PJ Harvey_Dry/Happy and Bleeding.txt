Happy and Bleeding Lyrics
She'd burst
Dropped off
Picked the fruit
And realize
I'm naked
I'm naked, too

So cover my body
Dress it fine
Hide my
Linen and lace
Been sewing ever since
Since time began

More than the hills
More than the trees
More than the mountains, you
More than I can see
In front of me
More than the mountains, you

So fruit flower myself inside out
I'm happy and bleeding for you
Fruit flower myself inside out
I'm tired and I'm bleeding for you
This fruit was bruised
Dropped off and blue
Out of season, happy I'm bleeding
Long overdue
Too early and it's late, too
Too early and it's late, too
Mind and body
I would and I would not do

Fruit flower myself inside out
I'm happy and bleeding for you
Fruit flower myself inside out
I'm tired and I'm bleeding for you

Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you

Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'm
Fig, fruit, flower myself inside out for you
Happy I'm bleeding, happy I'mEmbed
