Joe Lyrics
Joe, ain't you my buddy thee?
Stay with me when I fall and die
Always thought you'd come rushing in
To clear the shit out of my eye

Joe, ain't you my buddy thee?
Lay my enemies out in lines
Come in close and I'll wash your feet
With my hair I'd mop them dry

With my hair I'd mop them dry
Something over there I do not like
There's no use in wondering

Joe, you be my buddy please
In this hell and dead-lock time
When I'm trussed in that headache tree
Cut me down with your silver knife

Cut me down with your silver knife
Something over there I do not like
There's no use in wondering1Embed
