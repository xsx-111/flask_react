Water Lyrics
Water
Walking
Walking on water
Walking
Walking on for years, and years, and years
Taking it into my head
Living by the right lines
Reading what the very man said

Water
I'm walking
Walking on water
Walking
Walking on

Nighing on eleven years
Taking it into my head
Mary, Mary drop me softly
Been reading what your very man said
Nighing on eleven years
Taking it into my head
Leave my clothes on the beach
I'm walking down into the sea
Prove it to me
Prove it to me
Prove it to me

Now the water to my ankles
Now the water to my knees
Think of him, all waxy wings
Melted down into the sea
Mary, Mary, what your man said
Washing in all over my head
Mary, Mary, hold on tightly
Over water, under the sea

Wa-wa-wa-water
Wa-wa-wa-water
I'm walking
Walking on wa-wa-wa-water
I'm walking
Walking on wa-wa-wa-water
Walking
Walking on wa-wa-wa-water
Walking
Walking on wa-wa-wa-water1Embed
