Oh My Lover Lyrics
Oh, my lover
Don't you know it's all right?
You can love her
And you can love me at the same time
Much to discover
I know you don't have the time but
Oh, my lover
Don't you know it's all right?

Oh, my sweet thing
Oh, my honey thighs
Give me your troubles
I'll keep them with mine
Take at your leisure
Take whatever you can find but
Oh, my sweet thing
Don't you know it's all right?

It's all right
It's all right
There's no time
So it's all right
What's that color
Forming around your eyes?
Waltz, my lover
Tell me that it's all right
Just another
Before you go, go away
Oh, my lover
Why don't you just say my name?

And it's all right
Say it's all right
There's no time1Embed
