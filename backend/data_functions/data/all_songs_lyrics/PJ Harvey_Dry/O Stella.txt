O Stella Lyrics
Stella-Marie you're my star
Stella-Marie you're my star
Stand on ground look up at her
Just hanging in gold stone
Just hanging there, face froze

But I think I see her smiling
Think I see her smiling
Think I see her smiling
Think I see her smiling

Go, go, go
Go, go!

Stella-Marie you're my star
In your blue, blue tavern, you light my lantern
O Stella's large
Pink on her face
It's glowing this place

A place for heroes only
Place for heroes only
Place for heroes only
Place for heroes only
Go, go, go
Go, go, go, go!

Stella Marie you're my star
I pin you to my chest
Sell you to the rest
I kiss her gown
Send those angels down to woo me now

I think I see her smiling
Think I see her smiling
Think I see her smiling
Think I see her smiling

Go, go, go
Go, go!
Go, go, go
Go, go!
Go, go, go
Go, go!1Embed
