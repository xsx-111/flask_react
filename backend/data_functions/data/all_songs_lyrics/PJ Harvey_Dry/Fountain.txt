Fountain Lyrics
Stand under fountain
Cool skin, washed clean
Wash him from me

Along comes wind, a big bone shaker
Blows off my clothes, completely naked
What to do when everything's left you?

La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum
La-da-da-dum

Out of the blue, it is he
Vision to me, bearing leaves
Petals green, covers me in all my shame

Hand in hand, he's my big man
Stays with me some forty days
No words then goes away â€“ I cry again
On my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind
And on my hill I wait for wind1Embed
