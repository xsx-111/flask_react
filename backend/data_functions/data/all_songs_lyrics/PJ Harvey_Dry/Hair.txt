Hair Lyrics
Samson, the strength
That's in your arms
Oh to be your stunning bride

Samson, your hair
Glistening like sun
Oh would that it were mine

Samson, your hair that's in my hands
I'll keep it safe
You're mine, you're mine

He said "Wait!", said "Wait!"
"Delilah my babe, Delilah my babe"
Said "Wait!", said "Wait!"
"Delilah my babe, Delilah my babe"
Said "Wait!", said "Wait!"
"Delilah my babe, you lied in my face
You cut off my hair, you lied in my bed"

Samson, you'll stay with your 'Lilah
I hold you in my hands
Your hairy strength
My man, my man
He said "Wait!", said "Wait!"
"Delilah my babe, Delilah my babe"
Said "Wait!", said "Wait!"
"Delilah my babe, Delilah my babe"
He said "Wait!", said "Wait!"
"Delilah my babe, Delilah my babe"
Said "Wait!", said "Wait!"
"Delilah my babe, you lied in my face
You cut off my hair, you lied in my bed"Embed
