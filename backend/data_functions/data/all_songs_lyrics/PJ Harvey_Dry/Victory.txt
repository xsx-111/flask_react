Victory Lyrics
I stumble in and in
You fit me with those angel wings
Send me gold, set me high
Set it up I'm in the sky

And the storm is gone (And the storm is gone)
And the temperature's high (And the temperature's high)
And delight is dining (And delight is dining)
At my table

'Till I think ha-ha-ha how lucky we are
Angel at my table, God in my car
Get it at sea, take a ship
I'd christen her 'Victory', she'd make it

Victory
Victory

Come on boys, let's push it hard
You bump down push your motor car
Come on boys, you've done us proud
You can sweat, dig, I'll mop it right off your brow
Victory
Victory
Victory
Victory

'Till the storm is gone ('Till the storm is gone)
And the temperature's high (And the temperature's high)
And delight is dining (And delight is dining)
At my table
'Till the storm is gone ('Till the storm is gone)
And the temperature's high (And the temperature's high)
And delight is dining (And delight is dining)
At my table1Embed
