Belispeak Lyrics
Grandma, my sleep is narrow
Bid you bring me some strong drink
Strain out the pulps and set them close outside
For when my belly, for when my little belly speaks
Grandma, there's air beneath my bed
And it whispers
And it whispers when I rest
Bid hem the skirts in salt and vinegar, vinegar
And hover closely, oh hover closely under head

Grandma, the water is rising
My boundless hair has gotten green
I'll be your swimming forest island
Bid you walk safely, safely over me

Grandma, my hands have wandered
And my legs, my little legs are getting weak
Bid lend me your wispy frame
And guard my powers, guard my precious powers in its cage
Grandma, I've been unruly
In my dreams and with my speech
Drill little holes into my eyelids
That I might see you, that I might see you when I sleep
Grandma, the water is rising
My boundless hair has gotten green
I'll be your swimming forest island
Bid you walk safely, safely over me

I'll be your swimming forest island4Embed
