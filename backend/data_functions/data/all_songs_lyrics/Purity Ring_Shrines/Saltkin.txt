Saltkin Lyrics
There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form a salt, sprinkle it around me
There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form a salt, sprinkle it around me

Sleep is a welcome gadget
In our headbondhood
The crawling animals will seek
All things warm all things moist
I will relentlessly shame myself
In rest in wake in front of
My truly born beloved
For here I lie in wait
Hush little heart
Steal my sweating lips
Wield my starving hips

There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form a salt sprinkle it around me

Into a bright bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
Into a bright bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
Into a bright bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
The creeper's blood is seeping
From this undead wooden headboard
Varnish my forehead red in evening
Drip down over my jowls
Bid them writhe and sprout their
Heavy feathers lift my drooping head

There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form a salt sprinkle it around me

Into a bright bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
Into a bright bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return
Into a bright bound sea surrounded fury
Our bodies will return

There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form a salt sprinkle it around me
There's a cult, there's a cult inside of me
Form a salt sprinkle it around me7Embed
