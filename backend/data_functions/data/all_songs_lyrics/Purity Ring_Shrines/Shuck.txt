Shuck Lyrics
When the moon is full
And I've pried
I'll take up your guts
To the little shed outside
I'll shuck all the light from my skin
Then I'll hide it in you
I'll pluck the long grass
That grows from me and hide it (in you)

I'll pretend that I'm blind in one eye
And I'll hide it in you
It's like your head is crumbled
And hiding in you5Embed
