Obedear Lyrics
I came down over
The sleepy mountains where
Our wide toes plunged into
The weeping shale to tear our
Skin up off from the bottom
Leaves our ankles bare
Don't just wander back and forth
And leave it

Build it into pinnacles and shrines of some
Some ghastly predicament of mine you'll find
Leaves us plastered to a bed of hairs with
Me all coiled up near the bottom with my chest un-bared

Oh but dear the sky is low
Gather up its harm and gods with grateful arms
Oh but dear the sky is low
Gather up its harm and gods with grateful arms

Oh but dear the sky is low watch
Fluent sea men rig their rudders so they'll
Graze it with their wind arrows
'Tis in the fathoms that-that they brush below-low
Oh my dreams come back to me
Back to me, back to
Oh my wrinkles build on me
Build on me, build on

Oh but dear the sky is low
Gather up its harm and gods with grateful arms
Oh but dear the sky is low
Gather up its harm and gods with grateful arms18Embed
