Crawlersout Lyrics
Sea water is flowing from the middle of my thighs
Wild buffalo are dancing on cliff tops in the skies
Adorn me in feathers from dead birds
And contemplate the size of leather pelts to wind me in
Put shutters on my eyes, oh

They'll cover the hills with their sweet flesh and soft nails
They'll cover the doors with the screams that their minds dispose

Write it down, write it down
Down the names and dates of the daughters
Who bore out of me like grandmother's vines
They hang from the planks of my cedar grave
Grow pretty long lashes and beards
Guarding the rain of me from them heedless, trampling toes
Gathering honeybees in their sockets and creases and holes

They'll cover the hills with their sweet flesh and soft nails
They'll cover the doors with the screams that their minds dispose

They'll weave their long souls
Into the frame to grow their foliage in
They'll sew their long hairs
Into their beds to keep them crawlers out
To keep them crawlers out
To keep them crawlers out
To keep them crawlers out
Keep them crawlers out
Keep them crawlers out14Embed
