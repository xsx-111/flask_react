Bangkok Lyrics
Like you, I've been around the world, seen a million girls
I've seen Bangkok, I've seen Bangkok
Black, blue, red, wise, evil, very nice
Very nice

Like you, I've been around the world, worn a million pearls
I've seen Bangkok, I've seen Bangkok
I've seen Bangkok, I've seen Bangkok
 x4
So bring out your dead, bring out the light
Bring out your dark birds in flight
Bring out your red roses too
Hey, what's got into Sunny?

Oh, what's got into Sunny?
Hey, what's got into Sunny?Embed
