Hell LyricsI'll take my chances on the road
On the inside, I'm an ocean
Like a wheel set into motion into the storm
I'll take my chances
I'll take my chances on the road
On the inside, I am an ocean
Like a wheel set into motion into the storm
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Every murderer voted out of office is sold down the river
Every time I try to look into your eyes, an angel flies by
Baby, it's dumb
Look what I've become
Scum, a relic, a satellite
I was born bright
Now I'm dark as a well
A kite washed up on the shoreline
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down here, it's hell
It's hell down hereEmbed
