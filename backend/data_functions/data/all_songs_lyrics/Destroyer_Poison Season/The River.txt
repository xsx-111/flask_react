The River LyricsShe despises the direction this city's been going in
She rises above it all, cause after all, someone’s got to go free
And someone’s got to follow
The river...
Escape from New York. Escape from LA. Take it from me, leave London
You study your Braille. You listen to the hail outside
A comedy of souls. A plot thick with holes
In a windowless room on the outskirts of town, overlooking
The river...
You're living, you're breathing. You're living, you're breathing
You try to believe in, but you don't believe
You want them to go, they never leave...
Lily-colored livers
The rich man shivers for reasons unknown in the wind
"I'm over before I begin," he says
"I'm over before I begin to go,"
He says...Embed
