Archer on the Beach Lyrics
Careful now, watch your step, in you go
The Ash King’s made of ashes, the Ice Queen’s made of snow
And Archer’s where you left him, with his arrows stuck inside a peach
Awake on your crutches in the moonlight, Archer on the beach

Careful now, watch your step, in you go
The Ass King’s made of asses, the Ice Queen’s native snow
And Archer’s where you left him, with his arrows slightly out of reach
Impossible raver on your death bed, Archer on the beach

Careful now, watch your step, in you go
The Ice Queen’s made of ashes, the Ash King’s made of snow
And Archer’s where you left him, with his arrows all in a heap
Stapled to the neck of the storm, Archer on the beach

Careful now, watch your step, in you go
Careful now, watch your step, in you go
Careful now, watch your step, in you go

The problem with Destroyer is...
The night wears a thousand stitches above her right eye
The problem with Destroyer is...
The night wears a thousand stitches above her right eye
Then waves goodbye!
And then waves goodbye...Embed
