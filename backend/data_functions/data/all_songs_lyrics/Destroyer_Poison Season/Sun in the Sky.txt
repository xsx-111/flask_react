Sun in the Sky Lyrics
You don't start the fire
You just turn it on
Yours is to always know not why
Just turn your head and walk away
Dinosaur in the ice
Buffalo on the plain
Sun in the sky still rising
Children lost in the grain
Sun in the sky still rising
Children lost in the grain

Suffering every way you'd look
Really good in that thing
I tried to write a book for you
Couldn't hold the pen, couldn't find the paper
Tender is the night
That sweeps us up in its folly
I left my keys on the kite
And my violin on the trolley
I left my keys on the kite
And my violin on the trolley

What's in that dark glove?
Is it a song about Gloria?
Is it a song about love
And the stars up above?
You drink a cup of wine
To settle your nerves
You float down the Rhine
Beside your plastic bag
You float down the Rhine
Clutching a plastic bag
It's a miracle every time
I open my mouth
And silence is golden
It blinks and it sighs
It takes a look outside
At a ball on a tether
I know a lot about the light
And I heard a bit about the weather
I know a lot about the light
I heard a bit about the weather

To see you crane your neck
When the world's at war
When the world's at war
You get a tick in your neck
Some bands like the strife
Some bands like to shimmy
Bombs go off in your eye
I'm so much deeper than the damage
Bombs go off in your eye
I'm so much deeper than the damage

Dinosaur in the ice
Buffalo on the plain
Sun in the sky still rising
Sun in the sky still rising
Sun in the sky still rising
Sun in the skyEmbed
