Times Square Lyrics
Jesus is beside himself
Jacob's in a state of decimation
The writing on the wall wasn't writing at all
Just forces of nature in love with a weather station

Artists and repertoire
Hand in hand through the great doorway at dawn
The writing on the wall said, "Jesus saves"
The writing on the wall mentions Honey playing a game with the waves

You can follow a rose wherever it grows
Yeah, you can fall in love with Times Square
Times Square

Judy's beside herself
Jack's in a state of desolation
The writing on the wall wasn't writing at all
Just forces of nature in love with a radio station

You can follow a road to the ocean
Times Square
Times Square
Times Square
Oh, you could fall in love
Oh, you could fall in love
Oh, you could fall in love
