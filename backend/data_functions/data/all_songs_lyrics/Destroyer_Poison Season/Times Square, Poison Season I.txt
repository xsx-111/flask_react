Times Square, Poison Season I LyricsJesus is beside himself
Jacob's in a state of decimation
The writing on the wall wasn't writing at all
Just forces of nature in love with a weather station
Artists and repertoire
Hand in hand through the grey doorway at dawn
The writing on the wall said, "Jesus saves"
The writing on the wall mentions Honey playing a game with the waves
You can follow a rose wherever it grows
Yeah, you can fall in love with Times Square
