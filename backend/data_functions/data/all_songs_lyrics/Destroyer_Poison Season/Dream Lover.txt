Dream Lover Lyrics
Dream lover, I know
Someone's idea of fun
You and me fall in some city
Lovers on the run
Lovers on the run

Haunted starlight gets in your eyes
Grabs hold of us and turns us around
All the signs say you're in for a surprise
All the signs are saying this way to town
All the signs are saying this way

You're sick in bed
You're sick in the head
You'd love a dog to play dead
You'd love a dog to play dead
I think I used to be more fun
Ah shit, here comes the sun
Oh shit, here comes the sun
Look, here comes that sun
And now, here comes that sun
And lovers on the run
And lovers on the run
And lovers on the run
Dream lover, I know
Dream lover, I know
