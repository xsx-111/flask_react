Forces from Above LyricsForces from above deny you the right to be free in your own way
Forces from above love the camps of the world
Forces from above deny you the right to be free in your own way
Forces from above, wish you were here, we think the world of you
I tried to follow the lines to the letter
I was in love with you and your sweater
Oh, forces from above
I climbed high the cathedral steps, it was getting on
The evening progressed like a song
But forces from above
I got paid and then I wrote a song
I got paid and then I rode a song into the heavens
Ba-dum bum
Ba-dum bum
Ba-dum bum
I tried to follow the lines to the letter
On her deathbed, she said, "I hope you get better"
Oh, forces from above
I climbed high the cathedral steps, it was getting on
The evening progresses like a song into the heavens
Into the heavens
Into the heavens
Into the heavens
Into the heavensEmbed
