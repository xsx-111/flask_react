Girl in a Sling Lyrics
Two stars, three stars
The night sky above used to mean everything
Two horses in love
Girl in a sling

How come your eyes come
In and out of focus in the park
All alone, early spring
Girl in a sling

 x2
I've been sifting through these remains for years
Bitter tears, bitter pills
Oh, it sucks when there's nothing but gold in those hills!
Girl, I know what you're going through
I'm going there too
Girl, I know what you're going through
I'm going there too

I'm going there too
I'm going there...1Embed
