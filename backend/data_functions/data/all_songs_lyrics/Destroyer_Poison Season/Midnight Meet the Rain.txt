Midnight Meet the Rain LyricsYou make a plea for me to come to my senses
Just like the time before, the time before that
Visit the symphony and I smell a rat, well
Midnight meet the rain
Midnight meet the rain
Midnight meet the rain
You were standing on deep waters
We fill our cups with rum
And raise a toast to them
And raise a toast to the world of scum around us closing in
I travel light towards the light
I suffered a terrible fright last night
And I've got no interest in getting dressed today
To go outside and play a game you know so well
You make a plea for me to come to my senses
Just like the time before, the time before that
I visit the symphony, I smell a rat, well
Midnight meet the rain
Midnight meet the rain
Midnight meet the rain
You've been standing on deep waters
Midnight meet the rain
Midnight meet the rain
Midnight meet the rain
You've been standing on deep waters
You've been standing on deep waters
You were standing on deep watersEmbed
