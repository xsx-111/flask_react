Times Square, Poison Season II LyricsJudy's beside herself
Jack's in a state of desolation
The writing on the wall wasn't writing at all
Just forces of nature in love with a radio station
You can follow a road to the ocean
Times Square
Times Square
Times Square
Oh, you could fall in love
Oh, you could fall in love
Oh, you could fall in loveEmbed
