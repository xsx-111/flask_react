Shadows in the Rain Lyrics
What key is this in?
Wait! Wait! What key is it in?

I woke up in my clothes again this morning
I don't know exactly where I am
And I should heed my doctor's warning
He does the best with me he can

He says I suffer from delusion
But I'm so confident I'm sane
It can't be no optical illusion
How can you explain

Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain

And if you see us on the corner
We're just dancing in the rain
I tell my friends there when I see them
Outside my windowpane

Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain


Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain

I woke up in my clothes again this morning
I don't know exactly where I am
And I should heed my doctor's warning
He does the best with me he can

He says I suffer from delusion
But I'm so confident I'm sane
It can't be no optical illusion
How can you explain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain
Shadows in the rain1Embed
