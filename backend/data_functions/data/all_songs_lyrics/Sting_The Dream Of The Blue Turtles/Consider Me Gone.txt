Consider Me Gone Lyrics
There were rooms of forgiveness
In the house that we share
But the space has been emptied
Of whatever was there
There were cupboards of patience
There were shelf loads of care
But whoever came calling
Found nobody there

After today, after today
Consider me gone

Roses have thorns
And shining waters mud
And cancer lurks deep
In the sweetest bud
Clouds and eclipses
Stain the moon and the sun
And history reeks
Of the wrongs we have done

After today, after today
Consider me gone
I've spent too many years
At war with myself
The doctor has told me
It's no good for my health
To search for perfection
Is all very well
But to look for heaven
Is to live here in hell

After today, after today
Consider me goneEmbed
