Wichita Lineman Was a Song I Once Heard Lyrics...broadcast you’re listening to now
Yes I'm that preacher everybody's talking about
The Dr. Williams givin' out them red hot lessons ten dollars
New York and New Jersey every week
All the way down the east coast
From Boston clean down to Atlanta Georgia last week
I tore down the east coast
And from somewhere, I hear
Do somethin' to help you
Do somethin' to help yourself
Come get your mojo hey
Go in to Atlanta City an' be a winner
Go down to Atlanta City come back fat as a rat
Why should you be a loser when you can be a winner
Yes ma'am yes sir I-
Brooklyn, New York
Brooklyn, New York
Get ready!
Dr. Williams will be in Brooklyn, New York
Tomorrow evenin' - Monday evenin'
6 pm until 8 pm
I'm talkin' to the hot... red hot, big money spending scum
An' you be there - 6 o'clock tomorrow evenin'
And then I hear
Bronx, New York
Get on the telephone, call 50 of your friends
Tell all your friends who need some help
Dr. Williams comin' to the Bronx New York
Dr. Williams comin' to the Bronx New York
Dr. Williams will be in the Bronx New York
Straight straight hot hot hot hot hot red hot
Big money blessing, can’t nobody stop these suckers
Even the devil in hell can't stop it
I'm getting ready to leave but I want you to know I love you
I'm talkin' to you baby
I'm talkin' to you sucker
I'm talking to (?) brother
I love you - I love you
I have a special phone number where you can call me so that I can send you a special giftEmbed
