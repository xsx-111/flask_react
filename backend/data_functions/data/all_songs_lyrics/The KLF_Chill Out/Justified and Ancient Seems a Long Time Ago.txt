Justified and Ancient Seems a Long Time Ago LyricsAnd we like to roam the land
We're justified and we're ancient
I hope you understand
We don't want to upset the apple-cart
And we don't want to cause any harm
But if you don't like what we're gonna do
You'd better not stop us cause we're coming through
All the way down the east coast
All the way down...
And we like to roam the land
We're justified and we're ancient
I hope you understand
We don't want to upset the apple-cartEmbed
