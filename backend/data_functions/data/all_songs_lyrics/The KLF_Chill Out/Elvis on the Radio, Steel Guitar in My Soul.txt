Elvis on the Radio, Steel Guitar in My Soul LyricsAs the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto
And his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto
As the snow flies
As the snow flies
As the snow flies
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born in the ghettoEmbed
