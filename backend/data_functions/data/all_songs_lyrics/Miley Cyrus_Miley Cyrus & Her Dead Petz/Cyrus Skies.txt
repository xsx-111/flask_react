Cyrus Skies Lyrics
Eyes are strange
They say everything while our mouths just try to sing
Singing something
I can never fall forever and ever
So I try to understand it all, but I fail to live it up
I'm still standing here forever without sunshine in my mind

Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
There's some kind of love that's so much higher
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar

I've seen death, I’ve seen truth
I've heard lies, I've seen birth too
I've seen happiness, I've seen pain
I've seen the sun come up and I've kissed the moon
I’ve heard voices through the wall
I've seen figures in my bed
I feel protected by things I don't understand
And that's more than you could say

Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
There's some kind of love that's so much higher
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liarEmbed
