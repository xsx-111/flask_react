Milky Milky Milk Lyrics
The milky, milky
The milky, milky, milky milk
The milky, milky milk
The milky, milky milk
The milky, milky milk

The purple that is collapsing
Head for the hills
And prepare your intellect to flow
Oh, oh, oh
The game of life is changing
Man is about to awake
Electric sun beams dancing
In a liquid in my skull

The milky, milky milk
Your tongue licking me so hard
And from sucking on your nipples
Licking milky, milky stars

I feel like a slab of butter
That is melting in the sun
Aggression melts away (The milky, milky milk)
Now that you and me are one (The milky, milky milk)
I made a 'nilla sundae
And the greatest truth appear
That opened up the flood tides
Of the last two billion years
I ask myself a question
What the fuck is God?
But I knew that I knew it
From the milky, milky gods

The milky, milky milk
Your lips get me so wet
While I'm singing all the verses
From the Tibetan Book of Dead

The milky, milky milk
The milky, milky milk
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's kind of a molecular thing
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's kind of a molecular thing
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
I feel like a slab of butter (Yeah, I'm digging it)
That is melting in the sun (Yeah, I'm digging it)
Aggression melts away (Yeah, I'm digging it)
Now that you and me are one (The milky, milky milk)
(Yeah, I'm digging it)
Now that you and me are one (Yeah, I'm digging it)
Now that you and me are one (The milky, milky milk)
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah
