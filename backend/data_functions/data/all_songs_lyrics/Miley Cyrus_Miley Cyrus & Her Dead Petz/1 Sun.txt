1 Sun Lyrics
We all walk around and waste life
It's just gonna go on forever
Like there's some eternal endless supply of what it takes to keep us alive
There might be a day when everything goes away
To remind us how ungrateful our culture is
We need to take time to replace what's stolen from Mother Nature

We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

I once heard Grace Jones say I have my own concept of time
I always think 'bout that 'cause I've always felt like
I was running a little behind
What's in front of me?
I don't know, 'cause I can't see what hasn't started to grow

We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)
Wake up, world
Can't you see the earth is crying?
Wake up, world
Can't you see all the clouds are dying?
And maybe one day there won't be rainbows
Grass won't be green and the sky won't be blue
I don't wanna see a cyclone
There's no sun, no moon
No me, no you

We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)5Embed
