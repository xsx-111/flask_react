Space Bootz Lyrics
Sitting here with nothing to say
Looking out the window
It just rained, but the sun's up for the day
And there's probably a rainbow
But I don't care 'cause all the colors left with you
Thinking about driving around in your car
I never thought that we would take it very far
I just love talking, and then parking, then we'd go walking
I loved you so much
I just started watching TV
I get so high 'cause you're not here smoking my weed
And I get so bored 'cause you're not here to make me laugh
You're so cute in your space suit
In your space boots
Space dude
Since you've left, I've started to drink
Sometimes now, when I do drugs I'll start to overthink, and I start crying
I think I'm dying
But I'm just tripping
Start spiraling down this hole

Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Every time we talk I feel like shit
I guess I was just tryin' to avoid letting myself feel like this
'Cause it makes me feel like I might die
But every second I'm doing that anyway
My biggest fear is not being with you
The pain is so excruciating I don't know what I'd do
We're both vegan
It makes it easy to think youâ€™d never hurt anything
Living intentionally

Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Space dude in your space boots and your space suit
