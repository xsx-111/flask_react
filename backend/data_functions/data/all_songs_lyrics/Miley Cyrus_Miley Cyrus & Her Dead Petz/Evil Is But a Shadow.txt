Evil Is But a Shadow Lyrics
Evil is but a shadow that always accompanies the good
You can try to have a world, a world without the shadow
But it will be a dark, dark and hopeless world
'Cause it would be a world, a world without light too
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

The light of nature
The light of the true
The light of silence
The light of all I do
The brigter it shines from the mountain
The more evil hides in its hole
Enjoy soo hard to defeat us
A world starting to lose your control
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control

We won't stop
We'll let it go, it drop
How'd it get to be so obvious?
I'll have fun
We won't stop
We'll let it fucking drop
We won't stop, oh
I'll have fun
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world2Embed
