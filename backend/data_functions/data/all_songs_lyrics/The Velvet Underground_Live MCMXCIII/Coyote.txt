Coyote Lyrics
Coyote goes to the top of the hill
Doing the things that coyotes will
Staring at the sky, at the moon
You know he starts to howl

Coyote goes to the mountain top
Looks over down at the river, says "What a drop
No tame dog is gonna take my bone"

Coyote at the top of the hill
Doing the things coyotes will
You got to cast the first stone
Cast the first stone



Jackal up on the top of the hill
Doing the things that jackals will
Cast the first stone


Coyote up on the mountain top
Says "What a drop
You got to cast the first stone
Cast the first stone
Cast the first stone
You gotta cast the first stone"Embed
