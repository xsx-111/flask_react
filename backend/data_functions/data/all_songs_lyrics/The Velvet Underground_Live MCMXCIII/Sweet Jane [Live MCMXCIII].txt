Sweet Jane  Lyrics
Standin' on the corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack's in his corset, Jane is in her vest
And me, I'm in a rock 'n' roll band
Huh
Riding a Stutz Bear Cat, Jim
Ya know, those were different times
All the poets studied rules of verse
And those ladies they rolled their eyes

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

Now Jack, he is a banker
And Jane, she's a clerk
And both of them save their monies
When they come home from work
Oh, sittin' down by the fire
Ooo, the radio does play the classical music there, Jim
The March of the Wooden Soldiers
All you protest kids
You can hear Jack say
Getting there


Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane

Some people they like to go out dancin'
And other people they have to work. Just watch me now
And there's even some evil mothers
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt
You know that women never really faint
And that villians always blink their eyes
And that children are the only ones who blush
And that life is just to die
But anyone who ever had a heart
They wouldn't turn around and break it
And anyone who ever played a part
They wouldn't turn around and hate it

Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when he smiles
Heavenly wine and roses
Seems to whisper to her when she smiles


Oh, la la la la la la
Oh, la la la la la la
La la la la la la
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
