Mononokay Lyrics
What does it mean to be happy?
And am I getting better?
I used to make excuses for myself but it’s not the weather
I’ve tried to rid myself of my anxious tendencies
But I have to accept my head for what it is to me
I’m not super human
Well I’m barely alive
But I would kill to leave my house and not be afraid of the outside
So I started thinking
It’d be so nice
To not have trouble sleeping
I haven’t slept in nights

So I called to apologize
For every night
I told you I didn’t want to live my life
But I hung up
Before you picked up
'Cause I changed my mind

I know more about plants
Than I know about myself
And if giving up doesn’t make you stronger then why the hell am I still here?
Call me depressed
And tell me to get over it
It’s not in my head
And it’s in my blood
So I called to apologize
For every night
I told you I didn’t want to live my life
But I hung up
Before you could pick up
Cause I changed my mind
And I’ve gotten better at getting better
And I’ve gotten better at getting better
At being me
I’ve gotten better at getting better
And I’ve gotten better at being me 
At being me3Embed
