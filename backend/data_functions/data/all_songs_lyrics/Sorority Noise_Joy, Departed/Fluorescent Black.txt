Fluorescent Black LyricsI felt you whimper, and I felt you shake
Collapse in my lungs, and I felt your shape
I was a boathouse, alone on a lake
Clear in my thoughts, an emptying fate
You were like water, drown in my eyes
Breathe in my voice, with each one I take
I'm just an orchard in the late winter months
And you're just a harsh wind that blows me away
I feel you break with every night that you lie awake
I was an old man, lying awake
Widowed in bed, at my own wake
I am the night sky, closing my eyes
Counting the stars, that you see in mine2Embed
