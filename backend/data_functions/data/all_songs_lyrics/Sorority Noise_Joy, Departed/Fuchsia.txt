Fuchsia LyricsFlower girl
I am not what I seem
I'm the reason
Your leaves are withering
My sun has set
And I will never keep you warm again
How I long to be in bloom for you
How I long to be in bloom with you
Pollen eyes
I fear that I'm falling asleep
Winter's calling me
Far sooner than it ought to be
How I long to be the soil to keep you safe
Will I ever be more than my mistakes?
Stoner veins
I'm feining death
I'm losing breath
And sense of time1Embed
