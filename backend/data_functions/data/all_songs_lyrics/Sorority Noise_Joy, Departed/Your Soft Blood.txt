Your Soft Blood LyricsHow do you become
more to your friends
than a conversation
piece
Does it make you feel better
knowing
you got the best of me?
I wanna mean enough to someone
that they feel the need
to tell me they feel the same
I can be replaced
I can be replaced
Less than perfect ideologies
this half-hearted psychology
is bringing about the part of me
that can't go to parties
and stays in my room
that can't go to parties
and stays in my room
Define me with long hair and cheap wine
refine me to slurred lines and blank stares
define me with long hair and cigarettes
don't chalk me up to anything less than sin
Define me with long hair and cheap wine
refine me to slurred lines and blank stares
define me with long hair and cigarettes
don't chalk me up to anything less than sin6Embed
