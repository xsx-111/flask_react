Art School Wannabe Lyrics
Wiping my eyes of sleep
Drinking yesterday morning's coffee
Slam my head against the wall
Put the same black jeans on
Wear a hat so you can't see my hair

Maybe I won't die this time
'Cause maybe I'll be fine this time

Maybe I'm my own greatest fear
Maybe I'm just scared to admit that
I might not be as dark as I think
Maybe I am not the person
That I never wanted to be
Maybe I'm my own greatest fear
Maybe I'm just scared to admit that
I might not be as dark as I think
I might not be as dark as I think

So here's the thing
I'm doing fine
I know that I'm not worth your time
You need a change
I'm still the same
You took everything but my name
Maybe I won't die this time
Maybe I'll be fine this time

Maybe I'm my own greatest fear
Maybe I'm just scared to admit that
I might not be as dark as I think
Maybe I am not the person
That I never wanted to be
Maybe I'm my own greatest fear
Maybe I'm just scared to admit that
I might not be as dark as I think
I might not be as dark as I think

Maybe I'm my own greatest fear
Maybe I'm just scared to admit that
I might not be as dark as I think
Maybe I am not the person
That I never wanted to be
Maybe I'm my own greatest fear
Maybe I'm just scared to admit that
I might not be as dark as I think
I might not be as dark as I think4Embed
