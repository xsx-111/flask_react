Using LyricsI started using again
Left my heart in Rocky Hill hole burning in my head
Needed a distraction from my head
Devil on my shoulder said try this instead
So I started using again
I started sleeping again
Traded late nights and sheep for vicodin
The guilt burning in my chest set in
I started sleeping again

I stopped wishing I was dead
Learned to love myself before anyone else
Become more than just a burden
I know I'm more than worthy of your time
I started smoking again
Guess I missed coughing my lungs up every morning
Needed anything to keep me breathing
To prevent my blood from bleeding
I started smoking again
I started loving again
Thought when I lost that will to live I could never feel again
I'll give it one more shot and let someone in
I started loving again
I started loving again
I started loving again
I started loving again
I stopped wishing I was dead
Learned to love myself before anyone else
Become more than just a burden
I know I'm more than worthy of your time
I'm more than worthy of your time
I'm more than worthy of your time9Embed
