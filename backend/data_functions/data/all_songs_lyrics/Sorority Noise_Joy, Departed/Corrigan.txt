Corrigan Lyrics
All I wanna be
is the one you sometimes miss
when you're with your friends
I wanna be the spit that tingles on your lips
and if you find yourself
scared to be alone
All I wanna be
is the house you call a home

All I'll ever be
is the sound of grinding teeth
the autumn wind that blows your hair
and the hand that's out of reach
If you think you can't find a way to breathe
all I'll ever be is the smoke to clear the sea

I will never be the one you need
I only hope to be the solid ground beneath your feet
I will never be the turning of your leaves
I just hope to be the one you call when you can't sleep
I will never be the one you need
I only hope to be the solid ground beneath your feet
I will never be the turning of your leaves
I just hope to be the one you call when you can't sleep.6Embed
