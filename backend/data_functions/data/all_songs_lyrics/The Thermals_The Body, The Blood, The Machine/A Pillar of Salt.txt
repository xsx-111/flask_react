A Pillar of Salt LyricsWe were born to sin
We were born to sin!
We don't think we're special sir
We know everybody is
We built too many walls
Yeah we built too many walls!
And now we gotta' run
A giant fist is out to crush us
We run in the dark
We run in the dark!
We don't carry dead weight long
We send them along to heaven
I carry my baby
I carry my baby!
Her eyes can barely see
Her mouth can barely breathe
I can see she's afraid
She can see the danger
And we don't want to die
Or apologize
For our dirty god
Our dirty bodies
Now I stick to the ground
I stick to the ground!
I won't look twice at dead walls
I don't want my wife a pillar of salt
I carry my baby
I carry my baby!
Her eyes can barely see
Her mouth can barely breathe
I can see she's afraid
That's why we're escaping
So we won't have to die
We won't have to deny
Our dirty god
Our dirty bodies!Embed
