St. Rosa and the Swallows LyricsPassing the corners we kissed in the rain
Passing the old rusted warning signs
What did they say?
I think they said 'Run'
Passing the roofs of excuses we made
Passing these open windows
What made me turn away?
How did I fight, the flat days and the static nights?
Saint Rosa, she flies
She flies with the swallows
Saint Rosa, I feel
I could follow back to Capistrano
And I will hold you tight
Through the cold days
And the frozen nights
Passing our enemies
Passing our friends
Passing the means we use to tell the difference between
It's subtle
And I try to remember
If I was ever lonely
If I was ever low
Hell, hell yes I was low
How did I fight, the flat days and the static nights?
Saint Rosa, she flies
She flies with the swallows
Saint Rosa, I feel
I could follow back to Capistrano
And I will hold you tight
Through the cold days
And the frozen nights
Passing all the days I switched to auto mode
Days for which I've nothing to show
Pausing on the days I'm afraid I'll forget
The day's only clear for a second
The day's only clear for a second
Day's only clear for a second
But I will hold you tight
Through the cold days
And the frozen nights
(Yes)
When it's cold, cold, coldEmbed
