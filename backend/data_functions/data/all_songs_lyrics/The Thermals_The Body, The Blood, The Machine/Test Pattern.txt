Test Pattern LyricsI believe, I believe
I could see, I could see you
Forever in my hand
But I believe, I believe
I could leave
And if you noticed
Then you would understand
And so I feel blown
Wide and low
If I feel you suffer and stand
'Cause I believe, I believe
I could see, I could see you
Forever in my hand
So you can call this a test pattern
So you don't have to commit
So you can change any day
I believe, I believe
You can see, you can see me
Forever by your side
And I believe, I believe
If you leave, if you leave
I would cry, I would cry, I would cry
Why do I feel so crazy now?
Why am I losing my mind?
'Cause I believe, I believe
You can see, you can see me
Forever by your side
Still, you can call this a test pattern
So you don't have to commit
So you can change any dayEmbed
