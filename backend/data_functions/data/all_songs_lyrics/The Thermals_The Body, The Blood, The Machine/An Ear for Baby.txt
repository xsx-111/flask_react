An Ear for Baby LyricsPull out your dead roots
Pull out your best suit
It's time to inspect the subjects
Lose your intentions
Lose your common sense
It's time to groom you for judgement
Stick to a numb stare
Strip to your underwear
It's time for you to be cleansed
Keep your eye's straight
For Christ's sake
Remember we're your friends
Good luck getting over the fence
Good luck putting even a dent in
The mission, the plan
Just breathe, you don't need to understand
Can you hear me? The siren's on
Let the water run, leave the lights on
An ear for baby if you need it
Can you hear me? I'll repeat it
Draw the bridges, dig the ditches steep
We're gonna need a new border
Get thyself in line, it's time for reassignment
Time for the new first world order
We got a job to do
We don't ask we tell you
Work is freedom, sloth is sin
So pull out your dead roots
Pull out your best suit
You know the one they're gonna bury you in
Good luck getting God on the phone
Good luck getting even, atone
You can trust me, it's not a test
And I won't leave you in this mess, any questions?
You in the back
Can you hear me? The siren's on
Let the water run, leave the lights on
An ear for baby if you need it
Can you hear me? I'll repeat it
Good luck getting over the fence
Good luck putting even a dent in
The mission! The dream!
The body, the blood, the machine
Can you hear me? The siren's on
Let the water run, leave the lights on
An ear for baby if you need it
Can you hear me? I'll repeat itEmbed
