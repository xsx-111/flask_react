Back to the Sea LyricsTwo by two
Lord we'll take 'em two by two
We'll lead 'em to the bedroom floor
We'll lead 'em in the dead of morning
Two by two
Lord we'll take 'em two by two
We'll lead 'em through the pouring rain
We'll lead 'em to the gas chamber
But not me
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
Back to the sea
Judge us now
Lord won't you judge us now
Everybody stand on two legs
Everybody kneel on two knees
But I'm turning around
And I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
(Yeah) I'm gonna crawl
Back to the ocean I know
Back to the ocean I need
Back to the sea
And all I need to evolve
Is to believe
So I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
I'm gonna crawl
Back to the sea1Embed
