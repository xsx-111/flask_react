I Might Need You to Kill LyricsLocusts, tornadoes
Crosses and Nazi halos
They follow, they follow
Lashes and grins
Ass-backwards medicine
They follow, they know
I might need you to lead
And part the sea so we can cross
If they follow us still
I might need you to kill
Every room and
Every human at will
They'll drown your disease
They'll pound you with the love of jesus
They follow, they follow
They'll own your days
They're only God's babies
They follow, they know
I might need you to hack
And cover the tracks so we can hide
If they sight us still
I might need you to kill
They can tell me what to read
They can tell me what to eat
They can beat me and send me the bill
But they tell me what to feel?
(Hey), I might need you to kill
Yeah, I might need you to kill
I might need you to kill1Embed
