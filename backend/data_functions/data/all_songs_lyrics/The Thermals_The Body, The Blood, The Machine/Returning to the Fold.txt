Returning to the Fold Lyrics(Wait)
I regret leaving my soul
I forgot I needed it to feel
And maybe when I die
I'll just grab it real quick
I'm coming right back
I regret leaving my mind
I forgot I needed it to think
And maybe to keep me alive
I can't believe I got so far
With a head so empty
But I still have eyes
Wait for me, wait for me
But I still have feet
Wait for me, wait for me
(Wait)
I regret leaving at all
I forgot I needed God
Like (a) Big Brother
And maybe when I die
Yeah, when I die
I won't die escaping
I'll die returning to the fold
But I still have eyes
Wait for me, wait for me
But I still have feet
Wait for me, wait for me
But I still have faith
If I ever had faith
Wait for me, wait for meEmbed
