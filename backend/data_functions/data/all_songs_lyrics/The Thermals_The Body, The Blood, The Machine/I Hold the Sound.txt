I Hold the Sound LyricsThe light out
We don't talk
We don't talk
We sleep now
The door locked
The door locked
We don't talk
We sleep now
I hold you
I hold the sound
We sleep now
It's safe now
We can move
The world is over
The world is over
It's early still
The sun is cold
The world is over
The world is over
I hold you
I hold the sound
I hold the sound
I hold the sound
We walk now
We can breathe
The world is flat
The sky is round
It's early still
The moon is cold
We walk now
We walk alone
I hold you
I hold the sound
I hold the sound
I hold the sound
I hold the sound
I-I hold the sound
The light out
We don't talk
The light out
We sleep nowEmbed
