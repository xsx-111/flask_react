Red Red Wine Lyrics
You got to be Deux Chablis?
Hey now, that ain't no stuff for me
Château Timberlay
As long as I can't see
Gallo or Muscatel
Either one would be just swell
I didn't come here to fight
Hey, just as long as that ain't white

Now, I ain't no connoisseur cat
C-conno-sewer rat

Red red wine on Sunday
Always tastes so good
Red red wine, gimme red red wine
Red red wine if you would

Hey now, as long as it is red
Oh, I'll set 'em up until we're dead
A Saturday sipping beer
Let's get a jug without a year
Now I ain't no connoisseur cat
But hell, you guessed that

Red red wine on Sunday
Just like Martin said
Red red wine, gimme red red wine
Set us up 'til we're dead

Yeah, man
Yeah, ha-ha-ha-ha, whoo!

I ain't no connoisseur cat
S'all about sewer rat

On Sunday
Just like Martin said
Red red wine, gimme red red wine
Set us up 'til we're dead (Ah!)
Red red wine, red red wine
Gimme a little— 'til we're dead
Red red wine, red red wine
Red us up 'til we're—Embed
