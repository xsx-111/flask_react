Never Mind Lyrics
Absolution is out of the question
It makes no sense to apologize
The words I thought I brought, I left behind
So never mind

All over, but the shouting, just a waste of time
Never mind
All over, but the shouting, just a waste of time

I'm not ready as I'll ever be
I climb the walls, I fall into the sea
I'm not ready as I'll ever be
And I suppose your guess is more or less as bad as mine

All over, but the shouting, just a waste of time
Never mind
All over, but the shouting, just a waste of time
And I suppose your guess is more or less as bad as mine

You oughta tell me
You oughta say if you're not sure
Oh, you oughta tell me
You got to help me remember
Never mind
All over, but the shouting, just a waste of time
Never mind
Over, but the shouting, just a waste of time
Never mind
Never mind
Never mind
Never mind

The words I thought I brought, I left behind
So never mindEmbed
