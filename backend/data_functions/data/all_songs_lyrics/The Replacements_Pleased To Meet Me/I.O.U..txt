I.O.U. Lyrics
Get me out of this stinkin' fresh air
Ninety days in the electric chair
Step right up, son
Gonna show you something ain't never been done
You're all fucked

Losing it don't cost much
On the dotted line, "You suck"
Never do what you're told
Plenty of time to eat it when you're old
You're all wrong, and I'm right

Please be on your honor
Please be on your side
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
(Back in here) Whoo! Whoo!

Listen to the story, alright
I'm losing all I own on that dotted line
Step right up, son
Gonna show you something ain't never been done
You're all wrong, and I'm right
You see, I want it in writing
I.O.U. nothing
Want it in writing
I.O.U. nothing
Want it in writing (Whoo! Yeah)Embed
