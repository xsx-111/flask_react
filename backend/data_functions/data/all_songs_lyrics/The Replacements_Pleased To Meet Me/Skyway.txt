Skyway Lyrics
You take the skyway
High above the busy little one-way
In my stupid hat and gloves
At night, I lie awake wonderin' if I'll sleep
Wonderin' if we'll meet out in the street

But you take the skyway
It don't move at all like a subway
It's got bums when it's cold
Like any other place, it's warm up inside
Sittin' down and waitin' for a ride
Beneath the skyway

Mmm-mmm, mmm
Mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm

Oh, then one day
I saw you walkin' down that little one-way
Where the place I'd catch my ride most everyday
There wasn't a damn thing I could do or say
Up in the skyway
Skyway
