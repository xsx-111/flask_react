Nightclub Jitters Lyrics
Nightclub jitters
I take a drink before I hit the town
Nightlife critters
Scurry to that sultry, smoky sound
Hurry now, the sun is goin' down
To the nightclub jitters
Only thing that scares me is the dark
The nightlife critters
"What's the cover? Where should we park?"
Stay at home just once for a lark

They say, "Now, don't be a stranger"
It really don't matter to me
I'd be willing to wager
That it don't matter much if we keep in touch

The nightclub jitters
I take a drink before I hit the town
The nightlife critters
They scurry to that sultry smoky sound
Oh, hurry now, the sun is goin' down

They say, "Now, don't be a stranger"
Hell, it really don't matter to me
I'd be willing to wager
That it don't matter much if we keep in touch
Don't matter much 'cause I got a touch
In the nightclub
In the nightclub
In the nightclub
In the nightclub
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oohEmbed
