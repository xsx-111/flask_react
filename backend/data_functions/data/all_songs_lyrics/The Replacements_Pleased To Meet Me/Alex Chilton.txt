Alex Chilton Lyrics
If he was from Venus, would he feed us with a spoon?
If he was from Mars, then that'd be cool
Standing right on campus, would he stamp us in a file?
Hangin' down in Memphis all the while

And children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
Yeah, I'm in love with that song"

Cerebral rape and pillage in a village of his choice
Invisible man who can sing in a visible voice
Feeling like a hundred bucks, exchanging good lucks face to face
Check-checkin' his stash by the trash at St. Mark's Place

And children by the million sing for Alex Chilton when he comes 'round, 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
Well, I'm in love with that song"

I never travel far
Without a little Big Star, ooh-ooh

Runnin' 'round the house, Mickey Louse and tarot cards
Falling asleep with a flop pop video on
And if he was from Venus, would he meet us on the moon?
If he died in Memphis, then that'd be cool, babe

And children by the million wait for Alex Chilton to come around, 'round
They sing, "I'm in love, what's that song?
I'm in love with that song
I'm in love, what's that song?
Yeah, I'm in love with that song"

Oh! Come on!1Embed
