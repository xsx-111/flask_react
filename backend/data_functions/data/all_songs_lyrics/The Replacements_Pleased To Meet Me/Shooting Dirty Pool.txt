Shooting Dirty Pool Lyrics
Rock 'n' roll with loud mouth
Spew in my glass
Stroke another one down
Right behind my back

Do us all a favor, get yourself a spine
Everybody's choking on the grapevine
Loud mouth!

Shooting dirty pool
Spewing dirty lies
Shooting dirty pool
Spewing dirty lies, oh-oh

I heard it on the airwaves
I've seen it in my glass
Oh, get your money on the table
Get your head out of your ass

You're the coolest guy that I ever have smelt
Ain't a notch on nobody's belt
Do you vow?
Shooting dirty pool
Spewing dirty lies
Yeah, shooting dirty pool
Spewing dirty lies, oh-oh

Why don't you get a haircut, sister? (That's it!)
Loud mouth!


Shooting dirty pool
Spewing dirty lies
Shooting dirty pool
Spewing dirty lies, oh-oh
Shooting dirty pool
Shooting dirty pool
Shooting dirty pool
Spewing dirty lies, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-ohEmbed
