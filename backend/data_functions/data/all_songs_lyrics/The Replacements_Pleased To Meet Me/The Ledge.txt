The Ledge Lyrics
All eyes look up to me
High above the filthy streets
Heed no bullhorn when it calls
Watch me fly and die, watch me fall

I'm the boy they can't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
All the love sent up high to pledge
Won't reach the ledge

Wind blows cold from the west
I smell coffee, I smell doughnuts for the press
A girl that I knew once years ago
Is tryin' to be reached on the phone

I'm the boy she can't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
All the love sent up high to pledge
I'm the boy she can't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
All the love sent up high to pledge

Priest kneels silent, all is still
Policeman reaches from the sill
Watch him try to try his best
There'll be no medal pinned to his chest, yeah

I'm the boy they couldn't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
I'm the boy they couldn't ignore
For the first time in my life, I'm sure
I'm the boy for the last time in my life
All the love that they pledge
For the last time will not reach the ledge
