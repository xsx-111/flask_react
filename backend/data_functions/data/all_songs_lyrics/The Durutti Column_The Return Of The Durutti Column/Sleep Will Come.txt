Sleep Will Come LyricsEvening is unreal
When morning leaves the moon
Approaching most in tears
He dances draped and new
Armed with many warnings
We face the ancient mold
If God and battles over
Just one of many roads
Forgotten dream
Peace will come and with it sleep
I clear my mind
Peace will come and with it sleep
Forgotten dreams
I clear my mind and
Peace will come and with it sleep
Forgotten dream
Peace will come and with it sleep
I clear my mind
Peace will come and with it sleep
Forgotten dream
I clear my mind
Peace will come and with it sleepEmbed
