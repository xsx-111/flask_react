Florence Lyrics
She could be my little freckled-face fidgeter, me but miniature
Sleeping on the sofa 'til she tackles and I tickle her, the whisperer
Uh, I could be your listener, telling me your stories
But I'm showing her a signature, the scribbler
Saying that she's finished but I tell her eat her spinach
And she'll see the sky's the limit, trust
'Cause when we're with it I can feel there ain't no limit
Just be free, me and my sister, I can see the skies are limitless
Uh, I feel her brush her hand across my cheek 'til I speak
I yawn and say "Good morning", keep her sweet, squeeze her deep
'Til she giggles, starts to wriggle in the sheet
Then she disappears and sweeps me off my feet, I need to eat
Uh, I'm reminded of the handshakes
Remember that I promised her some pancakes
So I stagger to the stove and start to stand braze
See, I'ma make 'em like my Nan makes

I see you perching on the corner of the weeping window pane
You're growing up fast just like the flora
The world is yours, come shine or rain

I could be your freckled-face figure, her but bigger
Shelter her from school when all the snitches start to snigger
I'll be sticking with her, hold her close and deeper within her
She would better me reading the recipe while cooking dinner
My little sinner wander walking in the park
Put her to bed then end up talking 'til it's dark
She spins a web and I get caught up in the laugh
I should go but though I know I shouldn't ask
See, my sisters like, "Nah, there's one more task"
I ain't bored of one, I'm laying with her 'til the morning come
More begun, I'ma warm her like the morning sun
"Good morning, Ben", again, we talk until the morning's done
Uh, and I'm reminded of the handshakes
Remember that I promised her some pancakes
So I stagger to the stove, start to stand braze
See, I'ma make 'em like my Nan makes
I see you perching on the corner of the weeping window pane
You're growing up fast just like the flora
The world is yours, come shine or rain
Whilst you're here beside me
Just know I'm only one pancake away
You'll know where to find me
Any time, any place10Embed
