No Worries Lyrics
We call it Manila
Rebel coming through with a skrilla
No worries
No worries
No worries
Uh, check, I don't ever, I don't ever
Check
No worries

I don't ever worry 'bout my next step
Uh, or ever even worry 'bout my next cheque
Like it's the best bet, trying to protect neck
Living in this hurry, only worry is my next breath
'Cause you can get left and ghost with the rest
And end up most, raise a toast to the death like it's blessed
But the second guess pokes through your chest
'Til you rest where your breddas left, wishing you were next
But the best don't fade, flicker where the flame blows
Uh, the circle still be tighter than some cane rows
I feel the pain, never worry if the pain shows
Maybe only reason I be feeling like I paint those images that fit
Quick like the minute that you flip
'Fore your finish, feel the ignorance and dip
Still you slip for a minute, blame the Guinness that you sip
Little piss, missing ignorance and bliss
No worries
So don't worry
I know it's all about the money
But we ain't in a hurry
Nah, it's no worries
So don't worry
I know it's all about the money
But we ain't in a hurry, nah
No worries

No drama, nah, nada
You falling out your tree, tryna be the top banana
Even the apple of my eye turn green with envy
When every jungle animal is on a feeding frenzy
Fear and loathing on this helter skelter
When all we really need is food, clothing and shelter
Played the hand they dealt ya down till the last card
You claim king but only jokers have the last laugh
So when alarm bells ring, we don't do a thing
But sing, it's sink or swim and the tide is in
Every night is a title bid
You gotta float when you're the butterfly that they tryna pimp
And pack a sting for those buzzing 'round your honeybee
But never sweating when it's coming to the currency
The money been the root of evil since Genesis
So I let the ink chase the paper when I'm penning this
No worries
So don't worry
I know it's all about the money
But we ain't in a hurry
Nah, it's no worries
So don't worry
I know it's all about the money
But we ain't in a hurry, nah
No worries

Nah, we ain't in a hurry
We ain't in a rush but we're steady pacing
Chasing payments is a blatant but we're staying patient
Pumping product from this basement, tryna make a statement
But ain't nothing changed when I check my statement
Remain determined 'cause the work is being put in
I'm aware of what I'm cooking and the people overlooking
Mastering this recipe before we hand it out
But still living hand-to-mouth
Thought I had it figured out, what a setback
That time is money that I'll never get back
And yeah, I get that, but listen, 'F' that
No time to dwell, 'cause only time will tell if it works
Flipping verses, filling purses is a gift and a curse
And so I live for the better and I learn from the worst
I'm burning, earnings will curve and it's discerning at first
Determine money for music is the plan I prefer
To tell my mother I'm a man of my word, it's no worries
No worries
So don't worry
I know it's all about the money
But we ain't in a hurry
Nah, it's no worries
So don't worry
I know it's all about the money
But we ain't in a hurry, nah
No worries

Ah, we just made some money for our family
Plan A worked out, we didn't need no plan B
Brothers upset, saying they can't stand me
Talk about the money that they hand me
Reckon we were angry, I'm sitting crisp
With my jigga Chris
Another freestyle, I know you lot are feeling this
Never hit and miss, sit another hit of this
Thinking of the lyric I should finish with, blahEmbed
