The Seamstress (Tooting Masala) Lyrics
Reckons I got a drinking problem
I've been sinking a lot of whiskey
Reminiscing about the shit forgotten
Never worry about ones who'd miss me, trust
'Cause I ain't thought about the past time
See, I just pour another glass like
I ain't up in the morning, still yawning from the last night
Time never been on my side, sit as the stars fly
'Cause dark eyes turn blueish
Need something newish, half-dark, half-Jewish
Someone to ruin all this dark I'm doing
From the barside, fluent in that Pharcyde sewage
I knew it, knowing that she could beat this
Deep stitch had me woven like the seamstress
Uh, got me say, I wouldn't repeat this
But deep this, reckon she could be the seamstress

Uh, she could be the seamstress
Deep this
I reckon she could be the seamstress
Uh, I need this

Now I got this sink in my belly so I drink 'til I fill it up
And lay back up in my bed 'til I'm feeling rough
She was feeling tough, trust, never feel enough
So I back the whole damn glass and never spill a touch
Trust, uh, still don't change nothing
Same bluffing, same blame with the same something
Same pain, spelt her name in the same substance
Shame say it ain't the same when the rains coming
'Cause there was something about her leaving
Colder for the evening, had me sober for the feeling, uh
Holding out hope, there's hoping to believe in
I was holding out for you but you were nowhere to be seen and
Uh, I was on my Jacks
Uh, tidying the flat
Mmm, just me and my cat
Reminiscing on the times I was single and haps
