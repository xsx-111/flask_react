Mrs C Lyrics
This is for Eliza

Mother told me to bring some flowers
But I was running late
Didn't wanna rush it, bought something safe
Shit, left it on the train in the fucking rain
Strange, I'd do it all the same just to come again
The pain, I know your girl's being strong for you
Telling me the world ain't long for you
I'm tryna make her laugh any way I can
Press her head into my hands but I'm feeling quite responsible
So I'ma keep her safe, don't you worry 'bout it
And keep that smile on her face 'til the summer clouded
And this ain't nothing to replace all the love that's shrouded
But I can see it on your face, you'd be fucking proud
And everybody else is too
'Cause your Eliza's a reflection of you
So when you're rested in the setting to soothe
Remember every single blessing is true, trust

And so I'm saying everybody else is too
'Cause little Harvey's a reflection of you
I'm saying everything you say rings true
Even Alex a reflection of you
And I can see it in the way you move
That my Eliza's a reflection of you
I'm saying everybody else is too
'Cause everybody else is too
No-one makes a better bagel, some'll come close
But the way you make the bacon is the bun toast
It's something special, couldn't sum it up in one quote
So these first four lines devoted to that one dose

Everybody else is too
'Cause little Harvey's a reflection of you
I'm saying everything you say rings true
Even Alex a reflection of you
And I can see it in the way you move
That my Eliza's a reflection of you
I'm saying everybody else is too
'Cause everybody else is too

Everybody else is too
'Cause little Harvey's a reflection of you
I'm saying everything you say rings true
Even Alex a reflection of you
And I can see it in the way you move
That my Eliza's a reflection of you
I'm saying everybody else is too
'Cause everybody else is too1Embed
