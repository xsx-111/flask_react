Sun of Jean Lyrics
Ayy, we just supported Nas
Whose world is this? Bruv, of course it's ours
Saying I ain't been the same since I caught the scars
They don't fade, I ain't ashamed, watch us fall from Mars
'Cause it's the fallen parts and all the dust settles
And we all call on ours fast as we pluck petals
Uh, we let the love pour into our brain
Another day doing more to maintain
Saying finally those tears in my mother's eyes
Tears from the other side
Tears of joy, her little boy's got his mother's pride
You don't know nothing 'bout the rain 'til you come inside
And watch it trickle past the pane as the summer rise
'Cause ain't no love inside my heart
Uh, except for my mother and my diehards
I stay firm, little brother keeps my mind sharp
If I lost yours, come and find ours

I've got pleasures
Becoming pressures
They make me want to drift away
They make me want to drift away

I wasn't running from the beast, I was running from myself
Running out of street, she was worried 'bout my health
Wasn't worried it was beef, wasn't worried it was girls
She was worried it was me and my mother couldn't tell
Something bigger than the world
Ay, for me and Ryan
Ay, now he could see that I've been crying
Tell a little lie and say there's something in my eye
And from the second he could see that I've been lying
He would think I wasn't trying
Telling him, look, honestly, I'm dying
To be the bigger man, the one that you're relying
On, I keep it strong, so I tell another lie
'Cause it's the only way to keep me from denying
So I tell him, brother, listen, listen, when the sun don't glisten
All the days turn grey and the love goes missing
Hate won't fade and the front row hissing
You're the only one who keeps my heart wishing
I've got pleasures
Becoming pressures
They make me want to drift away
They make me want to drift away
I've got pleasures
Becoming pressures
They make me want to drift away
They make me want to drift away

Call me the son of Jean, my little submarine
Me and my mother, there ain't nothing that can come between
Call me the son of Jean, my little submarine
Me and my mother, there ain't nothing that can come between
'Cause I'm the son of Jean

Uh, but she said that it ain't me without ADHD
88 keys, I was turning eighteen
She would stay and say please with a face that say cheese
Always tryna make peace like a plate of baked beans
That was me and my bean
That was me and my Jean
That was me and my Jean
He was a scribble of a boy, all hair and mischief
A two-foot tale of trouble, the bee's knees
A cartwheeling chatterbox of tricks, completely fearless
I had to carry a first aid kit, my band-aid boy
I had my heart in my mouth wherever we went
He'd do backflips into the pool when he was tiny
And the lifeguards would get all stressed out
He was a proper Mowgli, he embraced everything
Took things apart to see what made them tick
Such busy fingers
He would empty sugar packets onto the tables
In restaurants to draw pictures in
He used to draw on anything
Fantastical creatures with ferocious fangs
And now he draws with words
And I find lyrics on my till receipts and bills
He was never still and barely slept, so neither did I
I could never understand how he could watch TV
Upside down while kicking a ball
His eyes shone with wonder
Music flowed through him like a current
He'd upend a stool to use as a microphone
Singing away for his grandparents
He turned the world upside down and we're richer for it
He was and is a complete joy
The world is his, that scribble of a boy2Embed
