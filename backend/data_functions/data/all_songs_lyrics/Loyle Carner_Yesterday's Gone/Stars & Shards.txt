Stars & Shards Lyrics
I used to know this nigga Sonny who was ironically dark
Never consumed by the money but selling dro in the park
Became a main habit of his, bagging the piff
Cornucopias quoting the man, he was blagging the piff
It wasn't simple
Simpler than the previous maturity, he was lacking it
He was never mischievous, devious was closer
Only relevant if leaving us
He was too afraid so he stayed, forced to believe in trust
Honesty was the commodity he never possessed
Nevertheless, manipulate a woman beating his chest
Reaping the stress, seeking the breast, reeking of cess
Hear the pitter-patter, missing the latter, weeping to death
Without a shoulder to cry on, no one left to rely on
He was followed by some men in black like the belt of Orion
In the report, said he was caught dead in the snort
And was shredded, he never even embedded a thought

Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle

So let me start from the beginning, I’ll pad the middle with simple
Cutest of the children always displaying a dimple
Never talking out of line or defined as he fought the vine
But an awkward spine left him severed over single
Proud in the corridors, a wrong in yours
While the janitor was mopping floors
He was dropping whores on all fours, left her begging for a reason
Treason left him cold, never froze for an evening
But the body heat never seemed to keep his body sweet
On another meat, looking for another blonde to beat
Now the streets became his mistresses, turning his witness
'Cause when a weak spits, you don’t know who be holding hit list
Switch shift, he’s stumbling on the war path
Whores bark, meditating up in the raw dark
For more dark, he’s knowing that’s when the war starts
Cutting more lines than disabled kids up in Thorpe Park
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle

So I said the life that you’re living don’t seem to be making sense
Shaking pence out the cookie jar, looking hook on the bends
Losing friends, rookie, he spends all of his tens
On the little bit of leaf that will leave him stuck in the ends
He started to shot, losing the plot, itching his scrot
Little street corner located, dropping his crop
Others would watch, smother the block under the spot
'Til he found himself surrounded by brothers robbing his gwap
Didn’t seem to be the average type, caught a badge in sight Coppers turning foxes and it just wasn’t the rabbits' night
He wasn’t known for just a couple of minutes
Scrolling through his phone trying to bell a couple of digits
But nobody would answer
Chancer who took his last chance at a glance
In the drug deal stance
And now he dance with the devil in the park by the treble
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle

Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle
Stars and shards of glass will harm if they meddle7Embed
