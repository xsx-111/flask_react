Mean It In The Morning Lyrics
Only say it if you'll mean it in the morning
To me it seems a little more important
To see if she be breezy with that easiness of autumn
Before we get all caught up in the calling
But the way that I was falling back in '09
Fidget but feeling it was go time
Sitting with my missus, didn't show signs
Lines that were mine, kissing on that cold spine
Love was all and hopeless 'fore I focused on that co-sign
Sitting with my bro Kleff, listening to Mos Def
Waiting on a day's pay, promising to post cheques
But didn't have a bigger brother who would know best
Melting on the inside, trying not to show stress
But your choice, it was only your voice
That could sooth me and save 'til I'm showing your boys
How to glow, others grow, blowing your noise
So I stop and I thank you for showing those joys

'Cause they were saying I'm the lucky one
'Cause I was swaying with the change
Feeling ashamed when the money comes
But I've been waiting here for days, trust
And they would say when the others run
That she'd be waiting in the rain
Can't complain what the others done
I'll be the lucky one
Wish I could love you like I know I should
Waiting for better for forever while we're growing good
Feel like that young spun, living off my mum
Saying it wouldn't be fun, but it's dumb, 'cause I know it would
Hoping to show it like the growing of the sunsets
One guess, waiting for the day that we were undressed
And say the days seemed to fade as the fun gets
Few and far between, coming clean, coming one chest
Pressed like apple in the cider she was sipping
Uh, now we were drunk and she would listen
Longing for the later when you shaded her with kissing
And you coloured all her numbers
With the love that you've been missing
Now you sit indifferent, crippled in the heat
A little brittle from the evils that you speak
You see it deep, still you're wishing underneath in the sheet
But you need to keep it sweet

'Cause they were saying I'm the lucky one
'Cause I was swaying with the change
Feeling ashamed when the money comes
But I've been waiting here for days, trust
And they would say when the others run
That she'd be waiting in the rain
Can't complain what the others done
I'll be the lucky one2Embed
