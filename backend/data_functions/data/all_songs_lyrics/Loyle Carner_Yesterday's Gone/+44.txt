+44 Lyrics
You might find that you text this
At 2:00am to the girl you never slept with
But never mind at times thinking she's the best fit, eccentric
But ever elegant with them best bits, the next this text hits
Starts to wriggle where you left it
A sugar-soaked sentiment for sceptics
Then start to giggle as the ridicule reflects this
Stress, second guess, now you wish you didn't send this
'Cause you don't mean what you said in that text
And you don't mean what you'll be telling her next
You just feel a little lonely
Needing someone to press your forehead against chest
When you're needing a rest, this stress got you falling apart
No facade in your heart 'cause it's all that you are
But now you feel a false start's got you calling your past
And they ain't answering you, nah, 'cause it's all in a laugh, uh1Embed
