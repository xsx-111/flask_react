Swear Lyrics
 Oh for fuck's sake
 Mind my f... things!
 (laughs) Were you gonna swear just then?
 No!
 Were you gonna swear?
 No! You're mean telling everyone it's 'cause I swear at you. That's wicked!
 You did start it though
 No I didn't! Who started it? You, you shmoo!
 The only reason I swear is because you raised me and you swear
 I did not!
 You do swear
 I used to not swear for ages and then eventually you said to me, "Mum it's okay to swear you know." That's so true I never used to swear around you, mind ya bootsEmbed
