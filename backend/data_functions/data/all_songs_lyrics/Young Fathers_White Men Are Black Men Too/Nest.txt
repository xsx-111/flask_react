Nest LyricsHere we are
(Hey!)
Here we are
Baby
Been all around
Tasted pleasure
Took a little something from nothing
Made it into something for someone
You held me well
I’ll hold you well
You keep me warm
All day
All day
Pushing through the storm
All I got is my health
Pendulum has swung
She’s won my darling
Feed me mama
Food for the village
Feed me mama
Food for the village
A special bond baby
You’re in my arms baby
I feel you now baby
Hey mister
I really did you wrong sister
I really did you wrong sister
(Made it happen made it happen)
Hey hey mister
I really did you wrong sister
I really did you wrong sister
I really did you wrong
Hey mister
I really did you wrong
Really did you wrong
Really did you wrong sister
Hey hey mister
Really did you wrong sister
I really did you wrong sister?
Baby baby
You keep me warm
(Special bond)
All day
All day
Feed me mama
Pushing through the storm all
I got is my healthy
Feed me mama
Pendulum has swung
She’s won my darling
Feed me mama
Food for the village
A special bond baby
You’re in my arms baby
I feel you now baby
Hey mister
I really did you wrong sister1Embed
