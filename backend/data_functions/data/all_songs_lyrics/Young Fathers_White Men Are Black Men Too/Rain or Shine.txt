Rain or Shine Lyrics
(I may not be around, I may not be around)
No Jesus in my life
No demons in my life
(I may not be around, I may not be around)
Some say that I'm shy
But I think I'm alright
(I may not be around, I may not be around come rain or shine)

When the day ends, I'm alright (When the day ends, I'm alright)
Give me strength, give me pain (Give me strength)
The eternity is all the same (The same, the same)
Keep on searching for some strange
More power's not the cure (More power's not the cure)
Your position's not secure
You see him but don't see me
Ain't he handsome, ain't he free? (Ain't he handsome, ain't he free?)
Let the tyrant walk right in
Feed yourself, feed your kin
There's typhoid in the water (Hysteria, hysteria)
And he's giving out the orders
Some say I'm a magician (Some say I'm a magician)
Some say that I'm shy
I missed the initiation (I missed the initiation)
I'm ready to fly
(I'm ready to die)
I may not be around come rain or shine (x16)
(I could do more, I could care less) (x6)

I ain't strange enough
I ain't strange enough
Need help for my condition
Keep on spitting in the water
They keep sipping, they keep wishing
Imma show you where
Where to go down in the squalor
Get you hot under the collar
On the hotline show
I ain't strange enough
I ain't strange enough2Embed
