John Doe LyricsIn here you will find
Your two degrees of freedom
I say your name before I fly
Let you know I’m leaving
Touch the new world
See the breadline
Take it in take it in go
Thirty years and now he's flat lined
Say it ain’t say it ain’t so
Make the moula
Woo di hoorah
Rake it in rake it in more
Hang the hangman
Bang the gangbang
Call me John Doe
Let the good times roll
Call me John Doe
Let the good times roll
I got my morals
Beg or borrow
See these hands are empty
Hold the night-time
Wrong is right aye
All the fake is true
Street is church babe
Give me first aid
Gimme gimme gimme more
Which is worst babe
A kiss or curse me
Take me
Take me
Take me
Take me home
You're gonna find me dining with death
I’m gonna tell you how this ends
Call me John Doe let the good times roll
Call me John Doe let the good times roll
Liquidate the dreams so they can find somebody else
Exasperate the means
Its all about wealth
Choose to represent me like a dick caught in zipper
Ally I be on my own marching through the Champs-Élysées
I’m easy
Laissez les bon temps rouler 2Embed
