Still Running Lyrics
Here’s another ticket
Goodnight

Tonight I don't love God
My time to enjoy life
My time to ignore life
You're gonna die in my arms (oooh oooh)
Hiding from the torture (Where where)
Fire’s what you’re under
Still runnin' 

The devil’s boots don't creak
Dial the number but you don't speak
Dumb enough to be the bait
Ninety nine percent are waiting at the gates
Hate the motto
Pay up come back tomorrow
Suck it up like you fucking need it
Still runnin' 

The devil’s boots don't creak
Dial the number but you don't speak
Hundred percent is bloody blasphemy
(Still runnin) 
Motherfuckers dumb enough to wait
Tonight I don't love God
(Oooh oooh)
My time to enjoy life
(Where where)
My time to ignore life
You're gonna die in my arms
(Oooh oooh)
Hiding from the torture
(Where where)
Fire’s what your under
Still runnin'
When is the time?
When is the time to lay the roots?
When is the time to play it cool
What happened to the man who paid his dues?
(What happened)!!
What happened to girl who broke the rules?
(What happened)!!
What happened to the man who paid his dues?
What happened?! what happened?!
(What happened)!!
Tonight I don't love God (What happened)!!
You're gonna die in my arms (What happened)!!
I may do worse
I may find a job without pleasure1Embed
