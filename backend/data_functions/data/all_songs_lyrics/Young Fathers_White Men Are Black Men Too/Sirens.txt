Sirens Lyrics
Riding along with a dusty picture
Sure is getting hard to say I missed you
It’s in his blood it’s in his nature
Husband a
Brother
A friend
But it’s just too much
Too much
Oooh it's just too much
But you’ll try a little more again
A husband
A brother
A friend

Sirens 

Our leading light
You walk upright
Such a vision in morning light
You sing the words you’ve never seen
And you talk to your god and in your dreams
The police are on cocaine
And they wanna know my name
Said they love me all the same

Radio’s
Hyping up a little more
Oh my oh my oh my
Who’s next
The bullet never knows
Bang bang bang
Goes the lazarino
Hit the bulls eye
Fi fi fi finito
Shed them scales like a serpent
(ah ah ah)
Allergic to safety, too urgent
Too nervous

I’ll put the blame on you
When god is dead
You point the gun at me
Take me instead
And I know there’s violence
I see that look in his eyes
And I know it's violence
Everything won’t come out clear
Violate the silence
The silence
The sirens
The sirens
(Sirens)
