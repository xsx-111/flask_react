Shame Lyrics
Nothing but a barefaced lie
Is all you cunts can hold on to
I suggest you downgrade fast
Before it's a shame on you

Imma sing, "What a shame on you"
Where's your gall when it's a shame on you?

Nothing but a barefaced lie
Is all you cunts can hold on to
I suggest you downgrade fast
Before it's a shame on you

Is this what you're missing?
The diamonds and the gold
All my dodgy dealings
Just got deadly
Just got deadly
Just got deadly
(It ain't right) Is this what you're missing?
(It ain't right) The diamonds and the gold
It ain't right
It ain't right, baby
It ain't right
It ain't right for me and you
It ain't right
I ain't right
For you, you, you, you
For you, you, you, and
What you do to feel better?
What you do to feel good?

Nothing but a barefaced lie
Is all you cunts can hold on to
I suggest you downgrade fast
Before it's a shame on you

Imma sing, "What a shame on you"
Where they going, it's a shame on you

It ain't right
It ain't right, baby
It ain't right
It ain't right for me and you
It ain't right
I ain't right
For you, you, you, you
For you, you, you, and
What you do to feel better?
What you do to feel good?2Embed
