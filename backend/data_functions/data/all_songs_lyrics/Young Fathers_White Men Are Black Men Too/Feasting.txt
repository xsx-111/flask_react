Feasting Lyrics
I’m just feasting with panthers
Rolling around in their shit
You won't leave with answers
I still believe you love me

(Oh why)
Settle down settle down
With a love encounter
I can buy you a new language
Watch out
I said watch out
Without a shadow of a doubt
Settle down settle down
With a love encounter
I can buy you a new language
Watch out
There’s a shadow without a doubt
Whoosh!Embed
