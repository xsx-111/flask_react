Get Started LyricsGet Started
Simmer simmer down
Somebody
Take it on the chin and leave
The party
Which ever sins you gon need
Get started
Get started
Get started
Draw a line
Slide right in
Ruin a life
Gonna get fixed
Get a script
Life is cheap
Take my hand
Let you go
Who knows?
She said to me
(Said to me)
By any means
She wants to leave
Cut me deep
(Cut me deep)
Draw a line
I drew a line
You’re killing all the birds
That’s why they don’t sing anymore
(With any luck)
You’re willing your worst
(With any luck)
Bring blood on the floor
(With any luck)
I’ll try and I’ll try
(With any luck)
Cause my soul is malnourished
(With any luck)
I’ll try and I’ll die
Cause I’m being punished
I’m coming
I’m coming
Simmer simmer down
Somebody
Take it on the chin and leave
The party
The party
Get started
