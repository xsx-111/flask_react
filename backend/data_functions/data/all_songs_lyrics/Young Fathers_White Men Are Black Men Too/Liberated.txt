Liberated LyricsLiberated - is that how I feel?
This rude awakening
In this part of the town
Downtown baby you know
That I can’t let you stay
For it’s me me me me and more me
In my selfish ways
Ooou wish that I can say I love you
Without holding back back
I’m just a man
On the verge of being
The man
The man
The man
Don’t runaway
Runaway
Hey yeah yeah
Don’t hesitate
For a second
You point that knife at me
(At me)
Dig in real deep
The demon now needs ya
(Needs you)
A friend of mine
I’m a friend of his
The cockatoo sings for a stranger
Is all the same
Is all the same
So so so so
My lady is strange
She make me wanna
She make me wanna
Don’t run away
Don’t tell me why your waiting on me
Don’t tell me while your waiting on me
Don’t runaway
Runaway
Hey yeah yeah
Don’t hesitate
For a second
Don’t runaway
Runaway
Hey yeah yeah
Don’t hesitate
For a secondEmbed
