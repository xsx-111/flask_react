27 Lyrics
I know that it’s hard for me
I know it’s disheartening
Hanging low
Its gonna haunt you in your sleep
I can make it easy
Easier to breathe
It all seems wrong when you're picking out your coffin
I’m 27 and not in heaven
I killed a man with my bare hands, please forgive me
Lack of passion
Leave the dumb boy alone
I know your God is here right now
At least not for long
Save the embarrassment
Take your juju off of me
I do not agree
That it’s blasphemy
I’m 27
And not in heaven
Say what there is what there is to say when there’s nothing to say Nothing at all
Don’t say what there is what there what there is to say when there’s nothing to say at all
Say what there is what there is to say when there’s nothing to say Nothing at all
Don’t say what there is what there what there is to say when there’s nothing to say at all
One in a million
You look familiar
One in a million
You look familiar
I'mma haunt you in your sleep
Make it easier for me
I know that’s it’s hard to breathe

Don’t say what there is what there what there is to say when there’s nothing to say at all
Say what there is what there is to say when there’s nothing to say nothing at all
(27)
Don’t say what there is what there what there is to say when there’s nothing to say at all
(And not in heaven)
Say what there is what there is to say when there’s nothing to say Nothing at all3Embed
