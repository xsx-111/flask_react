Dopethrone LyricsDope priest prophecy, doomantra from beneath the sea
Green throne raised to the black sun
Doom child, wake to planet song
Rise
Black amps tear the sky
Feedback will free
Your mind and set you free
Rise
Black amps tear the sky
Riff hewn altar
Wreathed in smoke and weed, yeah
Dopethrone
In this land of sorcery, ah
Dopethrone
Vision through T.H.C, yeah
Dopethrone
Feedback will free, yeah
Dopethrone
Three wizards crowned with weed, yeah
Black monolith charged with unlight
Sacrifice to forever midnight
Towers, titan sonic wave
Sorcery, necromantic slaves
Rise
Black amps tear the sky
Feedback will free
Your mind and set you free, yeah
Rise
Black amps tear the sky
Riff hewn altar
Wreathed in smoke and weed, yeah
Dopethrone
In this land of sorcery
Dopethrone
Vision through T.H.C, yeah

Dopethrone
Three wizards crowned with weed, yeah
