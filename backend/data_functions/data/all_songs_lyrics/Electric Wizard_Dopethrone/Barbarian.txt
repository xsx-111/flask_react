Barbarian Lyrics
The wizard...

He left the northern hills to seek his fortune
A lone Barbarian with only death lust to guide
But he carved a kingdom of stone
King Conan, sitting on his bloody throne, no

His black mane sweeps across his face
Grim and silent with steely blue gaze
Like a panther ready to strike
His blade crashes down to end your life, no

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
Battle prowess, a true measure of a man
You think you're civilized
But you will never understand

Master swordsman of Hyborian Age
His name is a legend to this very day
Even gods cower when his sword is unleashed
Nothing dare face him, neither man or beast, no
Cut a bloody swathe across his battlefield
Red mist rising, break your human shield
Slashed to pieces is to be your fate
Unleash berserker rage no-one shall escape, no

Conan rules with an iron fist
Many people, they look up to him
Battle prowess the true nature of a man
You think you're civilized
But you will never understand

You think you're civilized
But you will never understand
You think you're civilized
But you will never understand
You think you're civilized
But you will never understand
You think you're civilized
But you will never understand
You think you're civilized
But you will never understand
You think you're civilized
But you will never understand
You will never understandEmbed
