I, The Witchfinder Lyrics
"I am Albino, you wish to see me?..."

I am Albino, evil witchfinder
I'll cleanse her sins, for witchcraft I condemn her
My implements of torture are bloody red
My conviction of sorcery will leave you dead
Will leave you dead
Will leave you dead

I am Albino, evil witchfinder
I know she's guilty before I find her
I'll pierce her flesh to find his mark
Torture, my pleasure, true servant of the dark
True servant of the dark

I, the witchfinder
I, the witchfinder
I, the witchfinder
I, the witchfinder
I, the witchfinder
I, the witchfinder
I, the witchfinder
I, the witchfinder
I, the witchfinder
I, I, I, I...2Embed
