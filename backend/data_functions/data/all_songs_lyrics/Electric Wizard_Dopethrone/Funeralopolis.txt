Funeralopolis LyricsFuneral planet, dead black asteroid
Mausoleum, this world is a tomb
Human zombies, staring blank faces
No reason to live, dead in the womb
Death shroud existence, slave for a pittance
Condemned to die before I could breathe
Millions are screaming, the dead are still living
This Earth has died yet no one has seen
Funeralopolis
I don't care, this world means nothing
Life has no meaning, my feelings are numb
Faceless masses filed like gravestones
Sacrificed for the glory of one
Funerary cities, flesh press factories
Corporate maggots feed on the carrion
Funeralopolis, grey morgue apocalypse
Black clouds form to block out the sun
Funeral planet, dead black asteroid
Mausoleum, this world is a tomb
Human zombies, staring blank faces
No reason to live, dead in the womb
Funeralopolis
Planet of the dead
Funeralopolis
Planet of the dead
Death shroud existence, slave for a pittance
Condemned to die before I could breathe
Millions are screaming, the dead are still living
This Earth has died yet no one has seen
Funeralopolis
Planet of the dead
Funeralopolis
Planet of the dead
Funeralopolis
Funeralopolis
Nuclear warheads ready to strike
This world is so fucked, let's end it tonight
Nuclear warheads ready to strike
This world is so fucked, let's end it tonight
Nuclear warheads ready to strike
This world is so fucked, let's end it tonight
Nuclear warheads ready to strike
This world is so fucked, let's end it tonight
Nuclear warheads ready to strike
This world is so fucked, let's end it tonight
Nuclear warheads ready to strike
This world is so fucked, let's end it tonight
Nuclear warheads ready to strike
This world is so fucked, let's end it tonight
