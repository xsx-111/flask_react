We Hate You Lyrics"You see man as a rather dismal creature.‚Äù
"Yes, why not? Look around, you'll see what's there. Fear and frightened people who kill what they can't understand."
A seed of hate from the day I was born
My right to vengeance from me has been torn
Hopeless and drugged - my black emotions seethe
Loveless and cold - my hate begins to breed
Black nebula, seething in my brain
Then your fucking world brings me down again
So I'll take my fathers gun and I walk down to the street
I'll have my vengeance now with everyone I meet, yeah!
A seed of hate from the day I was born
My right to vengeance from me has been torn
Hopeless and drugged - my black emotions seethe
Loveless and cold - my hate begins to breed
We... hate you! (repeat to the end)1Embed
