Vinum Sabbathi Lyrics
"When you get into one of these groups
There's only a couple of ways you can get out
One is death, the other is mental institutions..."

Extracted essence of the stone
Narcotic of the faceless ones
I awake on planet black
Freezing moon, no turning back

Forbidden Sorcery
Vinum Sabbathi

Now I'm a slave to the black drug
Forced to serve this black god
I thought myself a master of the arts
This dimension of misery is my penance

Forbidden Sorcery

Forbidden Sorcery
