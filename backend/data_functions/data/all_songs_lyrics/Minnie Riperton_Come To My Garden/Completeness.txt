Completeness Lyrics
You are my completeness beloved
Every breath of you is my life
Thrill me with your own Lover's Magic
Make me know that I am alive

I need you, my love
Complete me, my love
Be tender, my love
I need you, my love

Live in rapture, loving, needing
Teasing, pleasing, sharing, caring
Waken me, My Love, oh oh
Cherish me, My Love
I belong to you

Tender moments with you enchant me
Kiss me, make my world fade away
Love me as I want you to love me
Make the night melt into day

I need you, my love
Complete me, my love
I need you, my love
Be tender, my love
Live in rapture, loving, needing
Teasing, pleasing, sharing, caring
Waken me, My Love, oh oh
Cherish me, My Love
I belong to youEmbed
