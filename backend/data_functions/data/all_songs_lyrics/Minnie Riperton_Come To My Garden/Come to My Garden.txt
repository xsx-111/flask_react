Come to My Garden Lyrics
Come to my garden, let the stars fill your eyes
Come to my garden and walk with me
Come to my garden, no more dreams filled with cries
Come to my garden please

I'll take your hand and lead you from these bad times
I'll take your breath and give you mine
I'll take your hand and lead you where the truth lies
I'll take you with me now

You know you've lived here all your nights, all your days
You know you've lived here inside my mind
You know you'll stay here, for this you've lived all your life
You know you'll stay right here
You know you'll stay right hereEmbed
