Expecting Lyrics
She is thinking of the year, sixteen
Sixteen
She is taking down her thoughts, reflecting
Expecting
She is musing on her autumn, her dreams
Her dreams
She is making up her mind, expecting
Expecting
She is certain that she likes his schemes
His schemes
She is waiting in the woods, expecting
