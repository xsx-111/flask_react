Oh, By the Way LyricsLa, la, la...
Only in the time it takes to tell you
For not to tell, but to know is wrong...
Only in the time it takes to warn you;
I've known it all by myself to long...
(You've known it all to yourself to long, girl...)
La, la, la, oh...
Only in the time it takes to tease you;
Don't be dismayed by my subtle ways...
Only in the time it takes to kiss you;
I've wasted so many precious days...
I've known too long - this can't go on...
Now that I have found a way, it's up to me;
"Oh... by the way..."
"Oh, by the way..." "Oh, by the way..."
Now that I have found a way, it's up to me;
"Oh... by the way..."
"Oh, by the way..." "Oh, by the way..."Embed
