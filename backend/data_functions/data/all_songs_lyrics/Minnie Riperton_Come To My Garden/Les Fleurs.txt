Les Fleurs Lyrics
Will somebody wear me to the fair?
(To the morning, sing a lovely flower)
Will a lady pin me in her hair?
(Mmm mmm mmm)
Will a child find me by a stream?
(In the lovely, in the sunny shower)
Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream

For all of these simple things and much more, a flower was born
It blooms to spread love and joy, faith and hope to people forlorn
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
If he looks within he finds beauty and power

Ring all the bells, sing and tell the people everywhere that the flower has come
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Throw off your fears, let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born

May mosaydee kaylie lowya roses
(May mosaydee kaylie lowya roses)
Say money ain't na na no oh na
(Mmm mmhmm mmm mmm)
Looking for vayda tay breeze
(Looking for vayda tay breeze)
May mosaydee kaylie lowya roses
(Mmm mmhmm mmm mmm)
For all of these simple things and much more, a flower was born
It blooms to spread love and joy, faith and hope to people forlorn
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
If he looks within he finds beauty and power

(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
(Na na na, na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
(Na na na, na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
(Na na na, na na na na na na na)
(Na na na na, na na na na na na)
(Na na na, na na na na na na na)2Embed
