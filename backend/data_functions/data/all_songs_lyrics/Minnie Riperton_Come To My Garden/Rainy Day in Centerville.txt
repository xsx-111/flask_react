Rainy Day in Centerville Lyrics(C. Stepney - R. Rudolph)
Sitting all alone I hear the tapping of the rain
Dance ballerina dance
Talking with the rain in some small city I feel the pain
She's dancing all alone
Thinking how we'd wait together
Sitting by the fire in weather just like this
Playing lovers' games; hoping the rain would never end
And I thought about the night we met
How the gentle rain fell down, kissed the ground
Then I knew no one ever could take your place
Nothing seems the same but the falling rain
You've gone away
Walking by the sea; sitting beneath a tree;
You are not here..Embed
