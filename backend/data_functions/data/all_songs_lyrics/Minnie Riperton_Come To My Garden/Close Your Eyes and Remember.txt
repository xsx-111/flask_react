Close Your Eyes and Remember Lyrics
Blowing softly through a meadow, laughing like a baby, breeze
(Baby breeze, baby, breeze, baby, breeze)
Tapping lightly at the treetops, whispering among the leaves
(Through the leaves, through the leaves, through the leaves)

You hear the magic song that ancient poets sing, hey, yeah
It's sweet as morning dew, and sounds a lot like springtime

(When you close your eyes) you feel your heart go there
So close your eyes and you may find that
Fireflies were as bright as stars - close your eyes and remember
Summertime lingered on and on - close your eyes and remember
Your first love made the world stand still - close your eyes and remember
Close your eyes and remember
Close your eyes and remember (Remember when...)
The moon was made of cheese

Racing swiftly through the mountains, bubbling along the stream
(Down the stream, down the stream, down the stream)
Sighing sweetly through the hollow, gentle as an infant's dream
(Baby's dream, baby's dream, baby's dream)
You hear the magic song, that ancient poets sing, hey
It's sweet as morning dew, and sounds a lot like springtime

(When you close your eyes) you feel your heart go there
So close your eyes and you may find that
Fireflies were as bright as stars - close your eyes and remember
Summertime lingered on and on - close your eyes and remember

Your first love
Close your eyes and remember
Fireflies
Close your eyes and remember
Summertime
Close your eyes and remember
Your first love...Embed
