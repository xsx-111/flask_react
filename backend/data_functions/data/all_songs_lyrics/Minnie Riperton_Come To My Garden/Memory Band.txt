Memory Band Lyrics
Sail out of the dawn, glide past the day
Drift into the mist, float far away
Lift up the latch, squeaks of the past, dull lighted patch
Sail sideways till morning, backwards till noon

Climb into your head, look where you dare
Sit on every snowflake kissing air
Roam deep in the canyons beyond time
Reach through every curtain clouding mind

Sail out of the dawn, glide past the day
Drift into the mist, float far away
Lift up the latch, squeaks of the past, dull lighted patch
Sail sideways to morning, backwards till noon

Greet each blinking dot before your eyes
Weep with tender roses, petals sigh
Slip under the crack beneath your door
Step over the line where sky meets shore

Climb into your head, look where you dare
Sit on every snowflake kissing air
Roam deep in the canyons beyond time
Reach through every curtain clouding mindEmbed
