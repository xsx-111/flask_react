You Are My Love Lyrics
Oh, now let me tell you a little story about a heartbreaker!

Honey, I don't know why you treat me so bad
Well I tried so hard to make you see it my way
Just think of all the good times we had
But still you only ever wanna fight with me
We got to split apart before we kill
And start to put our minds together
We got to change this hell for leather world
And I will find myself another girl
We got to put our weapons down
And spread a little love around

You know
You are my love (Yes, you are)
You are my love
Oh, yes you are
Honey, you are my love (Yes you are)
You are my love (Yes you are)

Ain't you the girl who did me wrong behind my back
And tried to keep me double booked
We never seem to cross the tracks
And there's so much that you overlooked about me, girl
Remember, you sat down pretty on the windowsill
And made me swallow on your bitter pill
You thought the grass was greener over there
While certain serpents snaked around your hair
So pour a vitriolic coffee cup
And use your blackened heart to fill it up
Well, now honey we get to put our weapons down
And spread a little love around

You are my love
I want you, girl
I need you so (I need you so)
Now we know that
It's no secret
You are my love
You are my world
Light my shadows
Fill the heavens with stars
You're my love
You are my love
You are my lover
I need ya
I want you
Don't let me go
I need you so
Don't let me go
I need you so (Repeat to fade)Embed
