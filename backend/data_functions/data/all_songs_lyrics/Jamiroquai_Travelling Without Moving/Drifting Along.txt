Drifting Along LyricsNowhere to go
But I'll still be cruising
I live this life long
Long long time
You know I'm drifting along
Can't see where I'm going
I will get to my destination
I'm feeling the pressure
All around me crumble
But I won't be put down this time
I'm shifting along
Though I sing a sweet song
We'll murder in the streets where I be livin'
I'm closing my eyes
Don't want to see killin', no
Gentle giants will roam forever
I'm cruising the street
Wondering who I will meet
Oh love has got to
Reign in our world
La la la la
La la la la la la
I don't know where I am going to
La la la la
La la la la la la
I don't know where I am going to
Drifting along
Drifting along
Closing up my ears
To the sound
I don't want to hear cryingEmbed
