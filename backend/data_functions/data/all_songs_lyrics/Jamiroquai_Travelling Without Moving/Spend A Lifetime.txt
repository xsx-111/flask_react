Spend A Lifetime LyricsTouch me in the night time, all I want from you is love
And I know you can give me such sweet moments
To last me so long, you make me feel so strong
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, baby, make it happen
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, oh girl
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, baby
'Cos you make me feel that good
And nothing else matters until you're in my arms, girl
And all those broken promises we made to each other
We have so much more to give I know that we can do this
That's how I want to live eternally, together
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, baby
All I want to do is spend a lifetime with you, oh
Will you make it happen for us now, please this time
You know I need your touch honey, I want your touch honey
Like the morning sun has just begun
Girl, like the rain on my window pane
Girl, if I could make you stay more than one day
Eternally together, yes we
Oh girl I need your touch, oh girl I want your loving
Sweet, you know that we can make it happen
For you and for me to be
All I want to do with you girl is make it happen
All I want to do with you girl is make it happen
All I want to do with you girl is make it happen
For us this time, eternally together we will be, girlEmbed
