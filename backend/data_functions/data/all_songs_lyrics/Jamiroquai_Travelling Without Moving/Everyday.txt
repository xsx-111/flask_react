Everyday Lyrics X8
Yes I do
Yes I do
Yes I do
Yes I do

Baby, maybe
We can spend a little time together now that we're alone
So long I have been waiting
Now can't you let me take you home?
All these things we do
Will make our dreams come true
You want me and I surely want you
Tell me where to go
Tell me what I need to know
To take you on a little ride
Hold me, control me
Let me circumnavigate your body mind and soul
Like a, seed from a flower
I can grow and you must know
Sadness, don't mean a thing
'Cause you and me girl, you know we're in the swing
All the things that I want to get with you on a midsummer night
In the evening light, the sweet evening light
All these things we do
Will make our dreams come true
I want you, you want me
I surely need you baby
And so far what we've done
Has made our lives become
Something more than
Evening light to make it right
All, all I want from you baby
Is sweet loving now
No, I know, yes, I know
I know what I want from you girl
We can make it right
We can hold onto each other tight
Lose your inhibitions
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every little thing we do is right
Every little thing you say is sweet
Every little part of you I'd like to meet
I want you girl, you know I want you
I want you in the evening lightEmbed
