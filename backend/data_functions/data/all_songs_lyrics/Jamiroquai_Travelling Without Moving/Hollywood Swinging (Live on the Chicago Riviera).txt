Not too long ago
I went to the theatre
And I saw the Kool & The Gang show
I always wanted (oh yes I did)
To fit into a band
I got to, I got to:
Sing my songs, sing my songs, sing my songs
And become a big piano playing man
So here I am, here I am, here I am...
Oh, in this Hollywood city
Yeah.. City of stars, movies, women and cars
Well I guess.. I guess I have to stay! Alright!
