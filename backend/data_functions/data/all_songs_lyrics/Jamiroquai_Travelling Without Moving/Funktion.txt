Funktion LyricsWhat are we gonna do tonight?
We should go to a funktion
You know I love it
Come on and let me get through
I need to put in on you
You got me hooked up, baby
You know it's breakin' my mind
I want your body all the time
Delicious, she drives me crazy
The perfume that you wear seems to hang in the air
It's boogalicious and while that DJ's bustin' grooves
I've been makin' all the moves to taste your kisses
You know, honey
We're going to a funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, party people, get down)
We're going to a funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're going to a funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Come on like dat)
We're going to a funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know we're going to a party
It don't take much to start me, I'm a freakin'
Some people get their kicks when their shirts begin to stick
In a sweat down
(I got to get down)
Why don't you come on with me, lady?
I don't want to hear your maybes, I wanna get sexual
Girl, you got the body of a goddess and I want you at your hottest
Ooh, you wanna be my queen?
(Let's hit the scene)
Come on to the funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're going to a funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're going to a funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Now come on and drop it for me like diz)
We're gonna paint the town red
And then I'm takin' you to bed to spend the nighttime
And now that rhythm is complete
You got the world at your feet, you're outtasight
You don't have to be suggestive
I just want to get connected at the party, party
Why don't you groove down with me and join my funky family?
Ooh, you know

Now put your zoot suit on
Because we've got to move along
And we're gonna go dancing
These are disco nights and the moon is right for romancing
You know you're gonna dig it
But you just can't help to swing it to the music
Now all the girls grab a guy and the guys grab a thigh
So get loose
We're going to a funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
Get down to the funktion, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'll meet you at the funky junction, yeah, yeah, yeah
