Virtual Insanity (Live at the Verona Amphitheatre) LyricsOh yeah, what we're living in (let me tell ya)
It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doing for us
And I'm giving all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see
I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse
See, its a crazy world we're living in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
And I'm thinking what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties that earthly man has made
And now every mother, can choose a color
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane
To synthesize another strain
There's something in these
Futures that we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothing so bad. (happiness)
Oh yeah
I know yeah
Oh this virtual insanity we're living in
Has got to change, yeah
Things will never be the same
And I can't go on
Well we're living, oh oh
Virtual insanity
Oh this world has got to change
'Cause I just, I just can't keep going on
In this virtual, virtual insanity
That we're living in, that we're living in
That virtual insanity is what is
Futures made of virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by this love we have
For useless, twisting, our new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, oh
Futures made of that virtual insanity now
Always seem to, be governed by our love
For useless, twisting, of that new technology
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground, yes we do
Virtual insanity is all we ever know
Yeah is all I haveEmbed
