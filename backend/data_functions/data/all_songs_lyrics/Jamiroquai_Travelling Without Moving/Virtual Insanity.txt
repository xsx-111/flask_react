Virtual Insanity Lyrics
Oh yeah, aw
World we're livin' in
Let me tell ya

And it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doin' for us?
And I'm givin' all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothin's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse
See, woah, it's a crazy world we're livin' in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting, all the new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground
And I'm thinkin', what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties of Earth that man has made
And now every mother can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothin' left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane to synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures that we have to be told

Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting, all the new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground, whoa!

Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothin' so bad
As a meddlin' man
Oh yeah, I know, yeah
Futures made of virtual insanity
Now always seem to be governed by this love we have
For useless twisting, all the new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground

Oh, now there's nothing that we live in
It's all goin' wrong
Out of window, you know
There is nothing worse than a rambling man
There is nothing worse than a foolish mind
Virtual insanity is what we're livin' in
Yeah, yeah, it's alright25Embed
