Travelling Without Moving LyricsGet down, right on, get down
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', yeah hey
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', can't stop, no
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', yeah hey
I know all we're doin' is travelin'
Speed freak, faster than a speedin' bullet
Slow down, got to get down
If I don't, well if I don't I might just lose it
Locked up, you've you've you've got me, honey
Locked up under heavy braking, yeah yeah
You know I've got to hang on
Drive too fast I might be last, oh yeah, now, drive it
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', oh yeah
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', oh yeah
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', oh yeah
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', oh yeah
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', oh yeah
I know all we're doin' is
Travelin' without movin', without movin', without movin'Embed
