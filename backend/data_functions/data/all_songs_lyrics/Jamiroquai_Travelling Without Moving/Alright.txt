Alright Lyrics
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love

You, give me light
So tonight, take me there
I feel your sun
Start to glow and I know it, let me show you that
I want your love, I need your touch
For the rest, of our time together, baby
Come fly with me, eternally
You and me, we were meant to be

Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
We got to get together, baby, hey
Ooh, it's alright now

I see your eyes
Hold the key, to my paradise
Summer in your smile
Well it makes me feel so real
You tell me things, and my heart sings to the world
From islands in the sky
Take my hand, as one we will stand
You know it's never never, to say hello to forever

Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright (right now)
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
I need your touch
I want your love, so much
I need your touch
And I want your love, so much
I really need it, oh now, tonight
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever

Yeah hey
Alright
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever
Yeah hey
Alright
We'll spend the night together
Wake up and live forever2Embed
