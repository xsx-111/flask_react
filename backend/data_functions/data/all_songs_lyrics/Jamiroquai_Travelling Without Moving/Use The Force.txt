Use The Force LyricsOoh...
I must believe
I can do anything
I can heal anyone
I must believe
I am the wind (yeah)
I am the sea (woah-oh)
I am the wind
I am the sea
I am the sun
I can be anyone
Oh this world is mine (this world is mine)
For all of time (for all of time)
I can turn any stone
Call any place my home
I can do anything
I know I'm gonna get myself together
Yeah!
Use the force!
I know I'm gonna work it out. (yaoh)
Use the force!
I know I'm gonna get myself ahead. (yeah)
Use the force!
Use the force!
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha
Ooh
I can go eagle-eyed
Circling in the sky
Learn to love my life
I don't need no strife
I must believe
(I must believe, I must believe)
I'm a rocket man
(I must believe, I must believe)
I'm a superstar
(I must believe, I must believe)
I can be anyone
I can step beyond
All of my boundaries (boundaries)
It won't be hard for me
To feel what there must be
Oh...
I know I'm gonna get myself together
Yeah!
Use the force!
I know I'm gonna work it out. (yaoh)
Use the force!
I know I'm gonna get myself ahead. (yeah)
Use the force!
Use the force!
Ah-ha-ha
Ah-ha-ha-ha
Woah
I can do it do
Ooh I can do anything
Anything
