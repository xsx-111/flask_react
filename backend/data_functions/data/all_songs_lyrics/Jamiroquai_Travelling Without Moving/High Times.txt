High Times Lyrics
You don't need your
Name in bright lights
You're a rockstar
And some tin foil
With a glass pipe
Is your guitar - now yes it is!

Little Angela
Suffers delusions
From these high times
She's been cleaning up
Since she was fourteen
On the main line
And her hunky funky junky
Of a boyfriend
Got her on late nights
With her skirt tight
Whoa, she's a wild thing
Oh, letting it all swing
God bless our high times!

Don't you know that last night
Turned to daylight
And a minute, became a day
Last night
All my troubles
Well they seemed so, so far away
I'm searching
My reflection
For a glimpse of another me
I've got to get away from all these high times
'Cause these high times
Are killing me!
Now these high times go on and on and on
High times to rock your mind, yeah

This twisted, crystal kingdom
Where you live your nine lives
And your head spins
With purple cyclones
Made of Dexedrine
(Gimme some of that)
And when the phone rings
You think bad things
Well, these are high high high high times, yeah
In any backstreet
When you take a hot seat
Make sure you check your flight times
Whoa, mama!


Now drop it this time
Paranoia will destroy ya (x3)
Paranoia
Paranoia
This time!

La la la la la la
High times (oh yeah)
Ooh, we're living in high
High times, yeah
Last night
Turned to daylight
And a moment
Half a world away
Time can be so precious
When you throw your
Life away
I can't help living it up
Letting it all go wrong
I can't believe in these white lines
Knowing my life has gone
Kids wanna give it up
Kids wanna give it up
Time to let your mind be free
Searching for eternity (x3)
Kids wanna give it up
Kids wanna give it up
Yeah, alrightEmbed
