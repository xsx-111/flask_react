Easy Exit Station LyricsHow d'you get to be so beautiful?
How d'you get to be so?
When all my weaknesses are shining through
How'd it get to be so?
'cause you're still mine
And I'm still yours
There's no one left to fall behind
When one's illusion is the other's proof
How'd it get to be so?
Sometimes I find it hard to say what I want to say
How'd it get to be so?
'cause you're still mine
And I'm still yours
There's no one left to fall behind
So you combed the explanation
It's an easy situation
Don't you know?
You know
Just a wispy conversation
It's an easy exit station
Don't you know?
You know
'cause you're still mine
And I'm still yours
There's no one left to fall behindEmbed
