Amazing LyricsWhen all you want to do is rock
But you don't want to bear the shock, no more
When its just sweat that fills your eyes
Belated feelings that you have denied
When every wolf is at your door
Just like a hundred times before
But you don't want to leave the end
You were amazing
And we did amazing things
And I wouldn't change it
'Cause we were amazing things
Rebuilding bridges in your mind
Your eagerness now is on the line
The plastic mountain at your feet
Divided streets now as you look to find a seat
When every wolf is at your door
Just like a hundred times before
But you don't want to see the end
You were amazing
And we did amazing things
And I wouldn't change it
'Cause we were amazing things
And I really didn't want that push today
No I really didn't want to end this way
But the things that seem to bind us
Are the things we put behind us on this day
You were amazing
And we did amazing things
And I wouldn't change it
'Cause we were amazing thingsEmbed
