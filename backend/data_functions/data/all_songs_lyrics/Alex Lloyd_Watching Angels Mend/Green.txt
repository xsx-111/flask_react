Green LyricsThis house is your own
Still living alone
It don't make you sad
But I think it's good to be green
The summer is gone
And spring don't belong
The traces are here
For long winter
I miss the green
It used to be clean
If you want to be free
Please don't fall for me
I could be anyone
But your friend
If you open the door
I'll give a whole lot more
I could be anyone anyone
Yeah
Assumption is good
Though not likelihood
My feeling is true
I want to be
Living with you
The truth it begins
We're breathing it in
With shadows of doubt
In time we will
All miss the green
It used to be clean
If you want to be free
Please don't fall for me
I could be anyone
But your friend
If you open the door
I'll give a whole lot more
I could be anyone
But your friend
Anyone Anyone
Anyone Nah Nah Nah no
Anyone Anyone
Anyone Yeah
If you want to be free
Please don't fall for me
I could be anyone
But your friend
If you open the door
I'll give a whole lot more
I could be anyone
But your friend
Anyone Anyone
Anyone Nah Nah Nah no
Anyone Anyone
Anyone Yeah
Seeing is believing
The feeling is deceiving
You know it's the truth
When you find that you
Can't talk
Leaving on this
All into chaos
Seeing is feeling is seeing is
Feeling is you
Feeling is you woah
Nah Nah Nah no
Anyone Anyone
Anyone YeahEmbed
