Trigger LyricsIt's a new day
Wasting away
Nothing to lose my friend
By the street lamp
Watching them move
On to the bus again
You're the old school
Breaking the rules
Party till the end
So you feel more
Something for
Hoping to make amends
Do you need
Somebody
Could it be anyone
But I know the answer
You're somebody
And if you feel this way again
These days you know they get better
If you feel this way again
These days can only get better
Star grace
Over your face
Into the night again
It's a cruel life
With nothing to bear
When everyone's a friend
It's a sweet song
All gone wrong
Don't seem like it will end
Put the blue sky
Into your life
Hope to make amends
And if you feel this way again
These days can only get better
If you feel this way again
These days can only get better
Sink sink it's coming round
Living it up
When you're feeling downEmbed
