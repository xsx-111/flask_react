My Friend LyricsOne day they'll pay to know your name
But you'll be dancing in the rain
You touch your heart to feel the beat
Must take precautions in the street
And all it was to know you
Ten seconds that I owe you
Will it be coming round again?
Just time to share a cigarette
I promised I would not forget
I'd like to see your face again
My friend
Angelic model sickness pill
How much they pay to see the stills
Ambition seems to serve you well
You trapped them deep inside your
Spell
And all it was to know you
Ten seconds that I owe you
Will it be coming round again?
Just time to share a cigarette
I promised I would not forget
I'd like to see your face again
Share my mind
Wish I'd leave it all behind
Much too much
To pay before you touch
In my mind we should leave it all behind
Cause it ain't got the strength anymore
No it ain't got the strength anymore
My friend
A pilot missile through the heart
As good a place to make a brand
New startEmbed
