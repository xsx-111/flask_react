Sleep LyricsTonight the tv is my friend
Life's misdemeanours
Won't let the magic in
Some inspiration
Then it stops
But when the rain it comes
It never wants to stop
Sleep sleep
It doesn't hurt to be here any more
Sleep sleep
A box of you is lying on the floor
God wants to know the long weekend
He'll get to know his son
Jesus as a friend
All superheroes fast asleep
It gets so busy seven days a week
Sleep sleep
It doesn't hurt to be here any more
Sleep sleep
A box of you is lying on the floor
For all misguided modesties
Illusions of the past
Not everything that's meant to be
Is always going to last
I love you
I love to turn you on
I love to turn you on
