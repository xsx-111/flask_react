Lost in the Rain LyricsI'll take you where you want to go
Under the city beneath it's tow
How much d'you think you're gonna see
Start to believe in. trusting is free
Don't get lost in the rain no more
Treading your imprint close to the door
It's only lonely when you don't know how far
Making it different asking for more
No place for where it used to be
Looking for comfort in all the wrong places
And this wall is slowly coming down
Leaving the fence now. moving it round
Don't get lost in the rain no more
Treading your imprint close to the door
It's only lonely when you don't know what for
Making it different. asking for more
Sing it loud now make it pure
You make it pure
You make it
Sing it loud now make it pure
You make it pure
You make it
Sing it loud now make it pure
You make it pure
You make it
Don't get lost in the rain no more
Treading your imprint close to the door
It's only lonely when you don't know what for
Making it different asking for more
Your in my arms again
Your in my eyes
Your in meEmbed
