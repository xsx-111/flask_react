GOD OF LOVE LyricsClean up the saints and wipe the blossoms
Stage a coup in Evangelion
Virginity!
Clay of my mouth, arise!
Hold seven solar systems in my hand
Kiss them and lick them with my little tongue
God of love, you granted me a swarm of bees
God of love, you took the Kaaba through the gash
Swan on the surface, arise!
Weeping little cosmos, announce!
Call of the lambs on the rise
Soft little hand, let go
Child in a cape, take charge
Eyes of the wooly lamb, well up
Bray at the nebula of Christ
Hold my teeming handEmbed
