PASAQALIA LyricsStay inside with my murderer
Claim my bride excelsior
Gates of light
Cage of skies
Crippled lion
Skulls of time
Stay away from my little girl
Stay away from my little baby
Tie the knot of nothingness
Face the scalding truth
Aging foal
Nailed to the coals
Stay away from my little girl
Stay away from my little baby
Stay away from my little girl
Stay away from my little babyEmbed
