HAQQ LyricsHaqq, haqq
Glowing authority
Haqq, haqq
Scourge of majesty
Sitting across from my tears
As I slither into the sun
I fear and love the pink alien in my womb
I offer a torrent of tears to the pyre of the world
I claim the mantle of nowhere
Glaze my spirit with quartz thorns
Stretch galaxies across my ribs
Ingest my tendons with a hoard of liquid teethEmbed
