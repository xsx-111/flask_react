HAJJ LyricsPower of God
Eyelash of grace
I eat the faultline of the stars
Pistons made out of marble dripping into a grail
Eyelash, eyelash of the hajj
Hajj, hajj
Intriguing polyanna
Hajj, hajj
Conditioned sycophant
Weeping ruby fire onto a sword
With 40,000 blades
Power of God
Eyelash of grace
Indigo and violet stems
Gently overtake my rageEmbed
