VIRGINITY LyricsI needed rain to condemn my domain
I chose the pain to betray the broken flame
I shot the life through a pair of grey wet embers
Take me back to the purple rock
Untie my act and revise the past
I crushed the game in the name of my female father
All the same
Show me to the magnetic room
Hand me off to my golden groomEmbed
