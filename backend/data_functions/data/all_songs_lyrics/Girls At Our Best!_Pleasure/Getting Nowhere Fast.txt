Getting Nowhere Fast LyricsYou're not looking forward and you are not looking back
You've lost the warranty, you'll never get your money back
My baby's buying me another life, getting nowhere fast
I am pretty smart, I don't do what they want me to
I don't and nor do you, that's what the general public do
My baby's buying me another life, getting nowhere fast
It makes you feel good, you've answered all the questions right
He's won a holiday, that'll help you sleep tonight
My baby's buying me another life, getting nowhere fast
We're not looking forward and we are not looking back
We've lost the warranty, we'll never get our money back
My baby's buying me another life, getting nowhere fast
My baby's buying me another lifeEmbed
