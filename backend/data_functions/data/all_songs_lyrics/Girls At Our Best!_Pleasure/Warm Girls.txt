Warm Girls LyricsWhat a gushing parade of lipsticks and locks
Swirling lime-green silks flutters and frocks
I ski and I ride and my fianc√© and I love to travel all the girls are so friendly
We do enjoy this life so much we're all such wonderful friends
And I love mental children
Love mental children
Love mental children
Love mental children
What a gushing parade of lipsticks and locks
Swirling lime-green silks flutters and frocks
Watch us dance and if you lip-read you can see what the BBC teaches
You watch me when you've lost your appetite for your wife
I can suggest you do the rest
Only in your head
Only in your head
Only in your head
Only in your head
Only in your head
In your head
Girls at our best!
Girls at our best!
Girls at our best!
Girls at our best!
Girls at our best!
Girls at our best!Embed
