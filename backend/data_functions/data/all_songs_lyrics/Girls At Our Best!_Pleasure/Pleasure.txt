Pleasure LyricsOne two go to Pleasure City Avenue
Three four head for Fun Land for a treasure tour
One two go to Pleasure City Avenue
Three four head for Fun Land for a treasure tour
Decorate the walls and doors it makes them all look nice
Take the cat out for a walk and help it kill the mice
This is heaven we are good as gold we won't grow old when we're told
One two go to Pleasure City Avenue
Three four head for Fun Land for a treasure tour
One two go to Pleasure City Avenue
Three four head for Fun Land for a treasure tour
Burn and throw and walking slow and sitting in the street
Swim and splash and eating trash and chewing on some treat
This is heaven we will die of pleasure no measure of leisure
One two go to Pleasure City Avenue
Three four head for Fun Land for a treasure tour
One two go to Pleasure City Avenue
Three four head for Fun Land
Selfish and lazy your room's full of toys
Stupid or idle you're out with the boys
Oh Daddy can't you see you're as bad as me?
Take a free ride through the town we do it for a lark
Holding hands with my best friend don't have to wait 'til dark
This is heaven we are good as gold we won't grow old when we're told
One two go to Pleasure City Avenue
Three four head for Fun Land for a treasure tour
One two go to Pleasure City Avenue
Three four head for Fun Land for a treasure tourEmbed
