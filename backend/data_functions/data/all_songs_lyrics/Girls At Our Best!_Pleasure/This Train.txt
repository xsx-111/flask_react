This Train LyricsThis train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, this train
This train is bound for glory, if you ride it you must be holy
This train is bound for glory, this train
This train don't carry no jokers, this train
This train don't carry no jokers, this train
This train don't carry no jokers, cigarette puffers, or cigar smokers
This train don't carry no jokers, this train
Wa-ho wa-ho wa-wa-wa-ho
This train don't carry no dancers, this train
This train don't carry no dancers, this train
This train don't carry no dancers, hoochie-cooch smoochers, or Charleston prancers
This train don't carry no dancers, this train
This train don't carry no extras, this train
This train don't carry no extras, this train
This train don't carry no extras, don't carry nothing but the heavenly special
This train is bound for glory, this train
Bound for glory
Bound for glory
Bound for gloryEmbed
