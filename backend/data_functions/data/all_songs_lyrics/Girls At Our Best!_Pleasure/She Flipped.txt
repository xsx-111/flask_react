She Flipped LyricsMy elder brother, he's an entertainer
Each day he has to go to court
Sometimes to tease her, always to please her
Suits him to play the jack of hearts
He stands on his head at the end of the bed
He really winds her up
And hides in the maze to leave her in a daze
Last thing at night he pulls her down
Da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da
Da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da
He blows her a kiss, then he gives it a miss
This fool will drive her mad
Goes head over heel, he knows how it appeals
Last thing at night he knows she's flipped
Da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da
Da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da
Da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da
My elder brother, he's an entertainer
Each day he has to go to court
Sometimes to tease her, always to please her
Suits him to play the jack of hearts
Performs a request then he chats up a guest
She never gets a break
Arranges a trick with himself on a stick
Last thing at night my lady loves
Da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da
Da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da
Da-da da-da-da-da da-da-da
Slip off your hose your lips red and rosy scarlet livery
Go out tonight you walk on the outer side sexy chivalry
Buy me a shirt take me on holiday gentile rivalry
Slip off your hose, your lips red and rosy, scarlet livery
Go out tonight, you walk on the outer side, sexy chivalry
Buy me a shirt, take me on holiday, gentile rivalry
One day he'll get caughtEmbed
