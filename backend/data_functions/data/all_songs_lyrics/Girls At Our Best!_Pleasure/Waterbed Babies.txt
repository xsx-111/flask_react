Waterbed Babies LyricsDown and under coming up for fresh air
Jump up and down knowing that it won't tear
Floating forever feeling like I don't care
Rolling on rubber just for the three of us
Wrap me in water warm and wondrous
Sink into deep sleep dreaming of too much
Aquamarine is my name
Water babies in the sea
Watermelons are for tea
Waterbeds are made for me
They make my mouth water
Down and under coming up for fresh air
Jump up and down knowing that it won't tear
Floating forever feeling like I don't care
Rolling on rubber just for the three of us
Wrap me in water warm and wondrous
Sink into deep sleep dreaming of too much
I go for trips down the Seine
Water babies in the sea
Watermelons are for tea
Waterbeds are made for me
They make my mouth water
Water chutes are slippery
Water sports in Tahiti
Waterbeds are made for me
They make my mouth water
Aquamarine is my name
I go for trips down the Seine
H2O for tea today
H2O for tea today
H2O for tea oh
H2O for tea oh
H2O for tea today
Water babies in the sea
Watermelons are for tea
Waterbeds are made for me
They make my mouth water
Water chutes are slippery
Water sports in Tahiti
Waterbeds are made for meEmbed
