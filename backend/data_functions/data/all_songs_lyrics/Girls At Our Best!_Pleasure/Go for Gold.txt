Go for Gold LyricsFar away from the desert I can recognize the sound
It's coming from the sea and the channel
I can see them, they're lying in the sun
They don't work much, they're busy having fun
They're not artists, you never see them frown
They play loud music and vamoose out of town
They got guitars
They drink in bars
They come from Mars
They don't drive cars
They big pop stars
Funky cowboys take a gamble, go for gold
Funky cowboys, very many records sold
They've all got girlfriends at home
Running riot at the local rodeo
Hear their records on the national radio
Their girlfriends go out with other boys
Se√±oritas with smiles on their lips
'Cause funky outlaws wear leather on their hips
Sell-out Sundance is looking at his sex gun
He don't know how the west is won
They got guitars
They drink in bars
They come from Mars
They don't drive cars
They big pop stars
Woo
Funky cowboys take a gamble, go for gold
Funky cowboys, very many records sold
They've all got girlfriends at home
Running riot at the local record store
Big discounts keep you coming back for more
Their girlfriends go with other boys
Funky cowboys never fight red Indians
Funky cowboys often look like Indians
They always guarantee a good show, that's where to go
They're very flash, get paid in cash
They're so young, I hope they don't grow oldEmbed
