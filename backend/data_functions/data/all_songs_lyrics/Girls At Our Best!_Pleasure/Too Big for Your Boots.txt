Too Big for Your Boots LyricsI will take a chance a large advance with some romance
Today we will eat cake I'll take a free blank tape
Down the Champs-Elysees they pay our fees it grows on trees
I know that he's very old he's told me that he's old enough to be my sugar daddy
I know he's so sweet his suit is cute he's sweet enough to be my sugar daddy
Let's go for one more ride he'll tread on your toots
Too big for your boots
Don't push it anymore he'll tread on your toots
Too big for your boots
I know that he's very kitsch and what a cinch he's rich enough to be my sugar daddy
I know he's so dark and in the stark he's sharp enough to be my sugar daddy
Let's go for one more ride he'll tread on your toots
Too big for your boots
Don't push it anymore he'll tread on your toots
Too big for your boots
Let's go for one more ride he'll tread on your toots
Too big for your boots
Don't push it anymore he'll tread on your toots
Too big for your boots
Let's go for one more ride he'll tread on your toots
Too big for your boots
Don't push it anymore he'll tread on your toots
Too big for your boots yes he is
Too big for your boots
Yes they're too big for your bootsEmbed
