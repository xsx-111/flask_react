Fast Boyfriends LyricsHi there, do you want a dance?
Cool drinks, holidays in France
Talk more, I love to hear your voice
You're fun, but there is so much choice
Some girls never settle down
Some girls have houses in town
I hope you don't think I'm a freak
But I always have to fall in love once a week
Oh, oh, here we come fast boyfriends
24 hour to take away
Oh, oh, here we come fast boyfriends
Last four minutes then thrown away
Garbo stayed home every night
Her love never saw the light
Raquel goes out everyday
Boyfriends never stay away
Some girls love a broken heart
Some girls love culture and art
I hope you don't think I'm a freak
But I always have to fall in love once a week
Here is my date today, wonder if I will pay
Now you see me now you don't
Your time is up, you're out of date, you're too late
Oh, oh, here we come fast boyfriends
24 hour to take away
Oh, oh, here we come fast boyfriends
Last four minutes then thrown away
Oh, oh, here we come fast boyfriends
24 hour to take away
Oh, oh, here we come fast boyfriends
Last four minutes then thrown away
Thrown awayEmbed
