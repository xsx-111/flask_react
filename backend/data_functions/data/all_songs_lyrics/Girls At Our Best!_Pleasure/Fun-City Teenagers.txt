Fun-City Teenagers LyricsYou can celebrate over a C.B. send me three three six
You can violate over a waveband and hold me three one four
Meet me in Money Town Fun City lights
Fun City teenagers all around tonight
You can make a date over a channel send me three three six
We infatuate you over headphones hold me three one four
Meet me in Money Town Fun City lights
Fun City teenagers all around tonight
Something free give to me
I'm going on a shopping spree no charge for liberty -- teenybopper rule
Something free give to me
I'm going on a shopping spree no charge for liberty -- teenybopper rule
You can celebrate over a C.B. send me three three six
You can violate over a waveband and hold me three one four
Meet me in Money Town Fun City lights
Fun City teenagers all around tonight
Something free give to me
I'm going on a shopping spree no charge for liberty -- teenybopper rule
Something free give to me
I'm going on a shopping spree no charge for liberty -- teenybopper rule
Something free color TV
I'm going on a shopping spree no charge for liberty -- teenybopper rule
Fancy a pair of shoes?Embed
