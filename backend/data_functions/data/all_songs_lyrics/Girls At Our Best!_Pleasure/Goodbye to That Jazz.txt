Goodbye to That Jazz LyricsWe will all applaud when the final curtain falls
Wave our little flags
Standing up to pray to the soup of the day
I say goodbye to that jazz
Run until you drop, you will get to Camelot
All that razzmatazz
Honor those on high, he's a wonderful guy
I say goodbye to that jazz
Goodbye to that jazz
Go to Toy Town with Taiwan
Welcome home to Pakistan
See my sister in Siam
Please to stay with me in Japan
We are in Ethiopia
Going out with Arabia
Stay the night in Bolivia
Entertaining in India
We will all applaud when the final curtain falls
Wave our little flags
Standing up to pray to the soup of the day
I say goodbye to that jazz
Goodbye to that jazz
No tradition anymore
No time for Anne Boleyn
Send me to the bloody tower
Someone tear off her head
No dark ages that has had it paint a palace red
Go to Toy Town with Taiwan
Welcome home to Pakistan
See my sister in Siam
Please to stay with me in Japan
We are in Ethiopia
Going out with Arabia
Stay the night in Bolivia
Entertaining in India
We are in Ethiopia
Going out with Arabia
Stay the night in Bolivia
Entertaining in IndiaEmbed
