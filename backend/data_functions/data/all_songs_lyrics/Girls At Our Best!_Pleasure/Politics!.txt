Politics! LyricsI love to hear the Democrats when they're partying all night long
Love to hear the Sacred Sect when they're saluting their favorite song
I love to see you smiling when you're traveling 'round the world
Love to see you smiling when you're kissing little girls
We want you -- U.S.A
We really do -- C.I.A
Your wife too -- K.G.B
The chosen few -- E.E.C
Get in line -- F.B.I
You're looking fine -- I.C.I
(It's really time -- ...)
Now you're mine -- K.G.B
I love to hear the Democrats when they're partying all night long
Love to hear the Sacred Sect when they're saluting their favorite song
I love to see you smiling when you're traveling 'round the world
Love to see you smiling when you're kissing little girls
Left right left right stomping down all through the night
Left right left right now I've got you in my sight
Left right left right did you get the money right
Of course you know what we need
We want you -- U.S.A
We really do -- C.I.A
Your wife too -- K.G.B
The chosen few -- E.E.C
Get in line -- F.B.I
You're looking fine -- I.C.I
(It's really time -- ...)
Now you're mine -- K.G.B
We want you -- U.S.A
We really do -- C.I.A
You know you've got nothing to lose
We want you -- U.S.A
We really do -- C.I.A
Your wife too -- K.G.B
The chosen few -- E.E.C
Get in line -- F.B.I
You're looking fine -- I.C.I
(It's really time -- ...)
Now you're mine -- K.G.B
We want you -- U.S.A
We really do -- C.I.A
You know you've got nothing to lose
We want you -- K.G.B
We really do -- U.S.A
Your wife too -- F.B.I
The chosen few -- I.C.I
Get in line -- (...)
You're looking fine -- (...)
Now you're mine -- U.S.AEmbed
