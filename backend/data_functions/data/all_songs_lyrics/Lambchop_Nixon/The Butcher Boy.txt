The Butcher Boy LyricsShe went upstairs to make her bed and not a word to her mother said
Her mother went upstairs too, saying daughter, daughter what troubles you
Oh mother, oh mother I can not tell
That butcher, that butcher, that boy I love so well
He courted, he courted, he courted my life away
And now at home, at home he will not stay
There is a place, a place in London town
Where that butcher, that butcher, that boy he goes and sits down
And takes that strange, that strange girl on his knee
And tells her and tells her and tells her what he won't tell me
Her father, her father, her father came home from work
Saying my daughter, my daughter, my daughter she looks so hurt
He went upstairs, upstairs to give her hope
And found her, and found her hanging from a rope
He took a knife, his knife and, and cut her down
And in her bosom, her bosom these words he found
Go dig my, dig my grave both wide and deep
And place a marble slab at my head and feet
And over my coffin, my coffin a snow white dove
To warn the world, the world that I died for loveEmbed
