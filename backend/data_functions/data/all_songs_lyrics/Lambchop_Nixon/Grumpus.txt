Grumpus LyricsOooooh (what's the matter with the boy?)
Oooooh (did he really have to be so sure?)
But you're not thinking
Ride around without a sound
Restless boy in a restless town
And you commence to drinking
A bottle up, a bottle down
A bottle white, a bottle brown
Another day peels away
Oooooh (what's the matter with the boy?)
Oooooh (do you really want another try?)
Part of the process
Is sifting through the piles of shit
That tell us you don't mind a bit
From a different angle
Such power rarely deviates
In times of love, in times of hate
Another spring will come
Faithful friends all around you
Wonder why you feel so low
Look at me, if you really want to see
The comedy and the clown
Oooooh (what's the matter with the boy?)
Oooooh (has he really given up for sure?)
Here's a new solution:
Be square and kind to all your friends
Stop staring through the bitter lens
Ancient institution
This learning not to demonstrate
Your asinine and callous traits
It could take some practice, I know
It could take some practice, I knowEmbed
