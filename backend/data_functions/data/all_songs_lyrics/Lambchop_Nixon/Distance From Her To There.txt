Distance From Her To There LyricsSo shy tonight
I'm told you were
I'm in the thick of it
I've been a dick with it
You'll get used to it
Well, I'm alright, well as you were
There's no use for this
It's not a theater kiss, no
It's like a railway piss
The lights outside tonight are far from home
And I'm out drinkin' in the yard
And I fell sadder for
The sad old bone
It's not far, really babe
It's just not that far
And by the light and so you were
It's such a cleaner wish
A much softer fist
A much weaker wrist
And by tonight you'll wait for her
So little hell to pay
It just works out that way almost any day
The lights outside tonight are far from home
And I'm out drinkin' in the yard
And I fell sadder for
The sad old bone
Ah, It's not far, really babe
It's just not that farEmbed
