What Else Could It Be? LyricsIt's the bad way you feel today
Brush the dog and you
Walk away oh there it is baby, you know that they feel the same
They wave as you turn away
Got your mind but you cannot stay sooooobaby you say what...high
As strante as it feels today I better die
It's the same any thought of you
Another sweet sweet soul...yeah yeah it's a
Man in a winter mood something about you (stop) baby
(stop) da da (DAH) da da (stop) da da da
Oh fell the breeze our soul you see 'em saying ohhhh
Baby they are saying...feel good just a storm is your
Heart try to raise some understanding see me standing
They are stone...gone
Is a problem we see today californ...california It's the
Way that you will be sorry, sorry is a man as he will be
Sorry sorry (stop) baby (stop) da da (stop) da da (stop)
Da da da daEmbed
