The Petrified Florist LyricsA goofy Libra
A drafty car
I do believe ya
I've stepped on my guitar
A borrowed bender
A liver ends
Until you've seen her
It's really just pretend
A coward's trade
A careful foray
Against the blade
A patent answer
I can't wait to get my hands on her
The closing of the coor
The blistered buttered roar
Oh, callous even hand
In the village of the damned
A broken glass
A broken table
The spitting image
If I was able
A frightened bird
The written word
This daily logic
Has become absurd
And when you see her smile
I'll have the fever for a little while
You'll never ever leave her
My crippled friendEmbed
