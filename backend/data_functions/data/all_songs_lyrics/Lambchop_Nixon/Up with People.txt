Up with People LyricsYeah there comes a booming sound
It used to come from underground
Now it emanates
From a kind of welfare state
Of the soul
Yeah baby of the soul
And of the sweet, sweet soul
Let's be certain
The deliberate monologue
As sure as if it will fall
Across you
Unto you
Will most certainly leave the doing
The doing undone
Come on undone
Come on undone
We are doing
And we are screwing
Up our lives today (today) 
(Up our lives today)
What's that we chanted
It's this we planted
Come on progeny (progeny) Embed
