You Masculine You LyricsThe shape of the sun
Ah, pretty ways
Pretty ways and things to come
When this day is done
You will collapse
Collapse into (the funnel of) my arms
And as always
They're not that strong
And as always
You do believe
And as always
I'm very wrong
About the cut
Above the bleed
April she finds the sugar time
And so slow, syrupy yeah
She'd be inside
You shed away a shadow as we go
And you know
It's not that bad
And I'm so
Into the blue
And it's so, like goofy sad
I just fly above the few
The last thing we do
Turn our heads around
Closer to the ground
You're falling
You and your masculine you
Forever benched
Sitting by the dirty window
And you know
It's not that bad
And I'm so
Into the blue
And it's so, like goofy sad
I just fly above the few
Though this seems to be a drag
You skirt around the things that's comfortable
Purple peppers, dirty rags
Make your life albeit more portable
To turn around to follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me1Embed
