Nashville Parent LyricsBut it just looks so cold there from the bottom
Another part of another ritual
Standing in the kitchen, arms are braced against the counter
Swallowing like mercury down the drain
And the neighbors have been drinking
And they are raising quite a stink
Pretty soon they will be fighting
It can get pretty ugly
The city makes a hooting sound tonight
The owl on the roof has got it right
If it's left up to him
He'll take that stupid grin
And decapitate a rodent or a mouse
Take the B train or the shuttle
At the exit have a smoke
Try to spit onto the sidewalk
Instead you wipe it off your chest
I don't wanna freak but the tongue erodes
Each time we speak
On a timely mission
Oh you look pretty swell in your new position
Fiberglassm funny face upon the wall
It's funny when it's not funny at all
And if it's up to him
You can take the ways of sin
And smash them like glass against the wall
But it's nothing too pathetic
Full of rhetoric and doubt
Carry on like little creatures
In the fields of our loveEmbed
