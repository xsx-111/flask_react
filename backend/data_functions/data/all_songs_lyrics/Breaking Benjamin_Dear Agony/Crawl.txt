Crawl Lyrics
A shadow of a man
I am nothing less
I am holding on
Still holding on
And every now and then
Life begins again
I am holding on
Still holding on

I'm not like you
Your faceless lies
Your weak, dead heart
Your black, dead eyes
I'll make it through
But not this time
Your hope is gone
And so is mine

Live! Fight!
Crawl back inside!
Sick! Blind!
Love left behind
And I won't live your weak, wicked lie
You pull me in
I'm one step behind
Show me where it hurts
And I will make it worse
Are you holding on?
Keep holding on
Dilated eyes
Shine for one last time
Are you holding on?
Keep holding on

You're not like me
Your faceless lies
Your weak, dead heart
Your black, dead eyes
I'll break you in
And let this die
Your hope is gone
And so is mine

Live! Fight!
Crawl back inside!
Sick! Blind!
Love left behind
And I won't live your weak, wicked lie
You pull me in
I'm one step behind
I'm becoming a monster
Just like you
After it all
You'll try to break me, too
Falling forever
Chasing dreams
I brought you to life
So I can hear you scream

Live! Fight!
Crawl back inside!
Sick! Blind!
Love left behind
And I won't live your weak, wicked lie
You pull me in
I'm one step behind

I'm one step behind
I'm one step behind1Embed
