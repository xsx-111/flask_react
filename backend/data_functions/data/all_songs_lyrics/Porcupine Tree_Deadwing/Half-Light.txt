Half-Light LyricsSuch a pale light
Such a long night
Pick up that key
Don't drop your gaze in your coffee
Is it me?
Do I look beautiful in the half light?
It's been so long
Years have gone
Since I belonged
Hold me please
Stay with me
And I will sleep
I will go now
But I will be with you
Hold my gaze
Hold me inside you
It's been so long
Years have gone
Since I belonged
Hold me please
Stay with me
And I will sleep1Embed
