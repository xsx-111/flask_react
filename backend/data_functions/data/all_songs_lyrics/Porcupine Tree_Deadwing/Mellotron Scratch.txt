Mellotron Scratch LyricsA tiny flame inside my hand
A compromise I never planned
Unravel out the finer strands
And I'm looking at a blank page now
Should I fill it up with words somehow?
I whispered something in her ear
I bare my soul but she don't hear
The scratching of a mellotron it always seemed to make her cry
Well maybe she remembers us collecting space up in the sky
(The scratching of a mellotron it always seemed to make her cry)
Nothing rises from my feet of clay, but it's OK
Red mist spreads across my fingertips, ardour slips
I lay her gently on my clothes
She will leave me yes I know
And I'm looking at a blank page now
Should I fill it up with words somehow?
The scratching of a mellotron it always seemed to make her cry
Well maybe she remembers us collecting space up in the sky
(The scratching of a mellotron it always seemed to make her cry)
Nothing rises from my feet of clay, but it's OK
Red mist spreads across my fingertips, ardour slips
(Well maybe she remembers us collecting space up in the sky)
Don't look at me with your mother's eyes or your killer smile
Sing a lullaby
Don't look back into black
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down
Don't look back into black
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down
Don't look back into black
(To end as friends; so painful)
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down
(Don't look down; shut it down)...Embed
