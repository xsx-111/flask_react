Arriving Somewhere But Not Here Lyrics
Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river rushing through your ears
Arriving somewhere, but not here

Did you imagine the final sound as a gun?
Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out was a song?
Arriving somewhere, but not here

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
And all of my dreams, sacrificed


Ever had the feeling you've been here before?
Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
Ever thought from here on in your life begins and all you knew was wrong?
Arriving somewhere, but not here

All my designs, simplified
And all of my plans, compromised
And all of my dreams...

Did you see the red mist block your path?
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you feel the envy for the sons of mothers tearing you apart?
Arriving somewhere, but not here13Embed
