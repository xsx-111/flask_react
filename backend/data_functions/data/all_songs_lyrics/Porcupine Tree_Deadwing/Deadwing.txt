Deadwing Lyrics
And something warm and soft just passed through here
It took the precious things that I hold dearer
It rifled through the cling and disappeared
The creeping darkness makes the small hours clearer

Like a cancer scare, in a dentist chair
Sucking in the air, wire across the stair
Kicking down the door at your local store
When your world of bore forces through the floor
Unexpected news, wearing high-heeled shoes
Blowing out the fuse, paying all your dues
Tempering lullaby, like a fractured tie
It's a worthless lie to the public eye

I don't take waifs and strays back home with me
My bleeding heart does not extend to charity


Yes I'd have to say I like my privacy
Did you know you're on closed-circuit TV?
So smile at me
And a dream you had, of your mom and dad
On a beach somewhere, and the boys aren't there
With the cancer threat in a cigarette
Deadwing lullaby, find a place to hide

And from the yellow windows of the last train
A specter from the next life breathes his bargain of pain
I look with you into the speeding black rain
Afraid to touch someone, afraid to ask her for a name


And in the morning when I find I have lost you
I throw a window open wide and step through2Embed
