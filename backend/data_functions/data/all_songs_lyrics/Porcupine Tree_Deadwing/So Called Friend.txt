So Called Friend Lyrics
Lip read, a mountain stream, fibres in the car
Shut down, a cheerless town, a head rolls in the park
Once seen my libertine undresses in the dark
She puts her love inside to break us both apart

With you I felt brand new, you opened up the sky
What need to punish me with surgery and lies?

Sleep well my so called friend, a virus in your heart
She bends my so called friend and rips my life apart

In sound escape is found from carving out the day
My gift a weight that lifts, my eyes give me away
You tell me all the things you know I want to hear
You stain the subterrain with sarin gas and fear

Sleep well my so called friend, a virus in your heart
She bends my so called friend and rips my life apart

What kind of friend are you?
What kind of friend are you?
You're so cold
What kind of friend are you?
What kind of friend are you?
So called friend
I miss the holy bliss of sun across the bed
How sad that all my plans seem foolish now instead

With you I felt brand new, you opened up the sky
What need to punish me with surgery and lies?

Sleep well my so called friend, a virus in your heart
She bends my so called friend and rips my life apart

What kind of friend are you?
What kind of friend are you?
You're so cold
What kind of friend are you?
What kind of friend are you?
So called friend
What kind of friend are you?
What kind of friend are you?
You're so cold
What kind of friend are you?
What kind of friend are you?
So called friend
Sleep well my so called friend, a virus in your heart
She bends my so called friend and rips my life apart
Sleep well my so called friend, a virus in your heart
She bends my so called friend and rips my life apartEmbed
