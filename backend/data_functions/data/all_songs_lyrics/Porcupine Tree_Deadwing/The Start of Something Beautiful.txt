The Start of Something Beautiful LyricsAlways in my thoughts you are
Always in my dreams you are
I got your voice on tape
I got your spirit in a photograph
Always out of reach you are
Cold inside my arms you are
Simple like a child you are
I remember when you took my hand and led me through the rain
Down inside my soul you are
The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent, forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Well think again
Mother lost her looks for you
Father never wanted you
I trust to love and then I find you never really felt the same
There's something in your heart so cruel
The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent, forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Well think again
The more I show the way I feel the less I find you give a damn
The more I get to know the less I find that I understand
Innocent, the time we spent, forgot to mention we're good friends
You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Well think again5Embed
