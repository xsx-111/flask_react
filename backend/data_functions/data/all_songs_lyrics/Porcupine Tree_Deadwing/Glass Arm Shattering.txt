Glass Arm Shattering LyricsFeeling all your touching
Feeling all your blood
Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your love
Seen it through a windscreen
Seen it through the glass
Seen it in a bad dream
Seen it in your heart
Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your love
Feeling all your touching
Feeling all your loveEmbed
