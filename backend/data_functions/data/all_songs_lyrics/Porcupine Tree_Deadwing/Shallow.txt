Shallow LyricsI don't remember
Did something in my past create a hole?
Don't use your gender
To drive a stake right through my soul

I live to function
On my own is all I know
No friends to mention
No distraction, nowhere to go

Shallow, shallow
Give it to me, give it to me
Scissors cutting out your anger
Shallow, shallow
No good to me, not if you bleed
Bite your tongue, ignore the splinter
This city drains me
Well maybe it's the smell of gasoline
The millions pain me
It's easier to talk to my PC

I live to function
On my own is all I know
No friends to mention
No distraction, nowhere to go
Shallow, shallow
Give it to me, give it to me
Scissors cutting out your anger
Shallow, shallow
No good to me, not if you bleed
Bite your tongue, ignore the splinter6Embed
