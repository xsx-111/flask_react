Night Windows LyricsIn the stick count for the song of knowing you're gone
Glancing up at where you lived when you lived here
I see you, suddenly alive and nearly smiling
Stop and hold my breath and watch the way you used to be
The full moon makes our faces shine
Like over-ironed polyester
Then disappears behind the clouds
And leaves me under empty rows of night windows
We could walk to where these streets get pulled together
A blinking line with gravel shoulders squared towards an end
Where the radio resounds from doppling traffic
Where the power lines steal s's from the hourly news
De-pluralize our casualties
Drown the Generals out in static
We'd turn and watch our city sprawl
And send us signals in the glow of night windows
But you're not coming home again (Night Windows)
And I won't ever get to say (Night Windows)
Remember how... I'm sorry that... I miss the way... could we?
Remember how... I'm sorry that... I miss the way... could we?
