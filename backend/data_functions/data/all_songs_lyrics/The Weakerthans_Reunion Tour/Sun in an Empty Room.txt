Sun in an Empty Room LyricsNow that the furniture's returning to its Goodwill home
With dishes in last week's papers, rumours and elections, crosswords, an unending war
That blacken our fingers, smear their prints on every door pulled shut
Now that the last month's rent is scheming with the damage deposit
Take this moment to decide (Sun in an empty room)
If we meant it, if we tried (Sun in an empty room)
Or felt around for far too much(Sun in an empty room)
From things that accidentally touch (Sun in an empty room)
Hands that we nearly hold with pennies for the GST
The shoulders we lean our shoulders into on the subway, mutter an apology
The shins that we kick beneath the table, that reflexive cry
The faces we meet, one awkward beat too long, and terrify
Know that the things we need to say (Sun in an empty room)
Have been said already anyway (Sun in an empty room)
By parallelograms of light (Sun in an empty room)
On walls that we repainted white (Sun in an empty room)
Sun in an empty room
Take eight minutes and divide (Sun in an empty room)
By ninety million lonely miles (Sun in an empty room)
And watch the shadow cross the floor (Sun in an empty room)
We don't live here anymore (Sun in an empty room)3Embed
