Hymn of the Medical Oddity LyricsOh, all the words I should not know
That those doctors wrote on me
Swell up and thrum their syllables.
Won't let me get to sleep
The sun will start late and clock out early
So I drive around and wait for it
Follow familiar roads
Emptied of every memory
Under a sheet of silence and unmarked snow
Then idle in some parking lot
Smoke half a smoke and ask
St. Boniface and St. Vital
Preserve me from my past
Repair our potholes, prevent plant closures
And if they remember me at all
Make them remember me
As more than a queer experiment
More than a diagram in their quarterly
Make them remember meEmbed
