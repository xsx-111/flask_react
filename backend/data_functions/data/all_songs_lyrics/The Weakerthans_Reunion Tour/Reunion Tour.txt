Reunion Tour LyricsRolling cable slick with beer to hang up on
The broken stands, the house lightsâ€‹ lit
Our injuries for crowds with plastic cups
That clapped beneath bartenders' sleepy brooms
And boom, boom, boom
Boom, went amps and cases down the stairs
Into the parking lot out back
A burst of moon, a blast of air
An understanding somewhere
Between the turning signal clicks
The shiny food we found with gasoline
The daily prayers of set-lists, tender jokes about
Retards and crashes and queers
I lost the chiming ring of keys to everything
I lost the chiming ring of keys to everything
I lost the chiming ring of keys to everything
Safe and safely locked away back home
Safe and safely locked away back home
Safe and safely locked away back home
Safe and safely locked away back homeEmbed
