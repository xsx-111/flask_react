Civil Twilight LyricsMy Confusion Corner commuters are cursing the cold away
As December tries to dissemble the length of their working day
And they bite their mitts off to show me transfers, deposit change
And I can't stop finding your face in their faces, all rearranged
And angry like you never were
And I ease us back into traffic
Dusk comes on and I wonder
Why I'm always remembering you
At civil twilight
For the most part, I think about golfing and constantly calculate
All the seconds left in the minutes, and so on, et cetera
Or recite the names of provinces and Hollywood actors
Oh, Ontario; oh, Jennifer Jason Leigh
But this part of the day bewilders me
Streets slow down and ice over
Dusk comes on and I struggle
Stop to stop, to stop thinking of you
In civil twilight
Hey, every other hour I pass that house
Where you told me that you had to go
I wonder if the landlord has fixed the crack
That I stared at instead of staring back
At you, my chance to say something
Seemed so brief, but it wasn't
Now I know I had plenty of time
Between the sunset and certified darkness
Dusk comes on and I follow
The exhaust from memory up to the end
Of civil twilight
At civil twilight
At civil twilight
At civil twilight2Embed
