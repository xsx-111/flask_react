Your Warm and Tender Love LyricsI was lost in the deep and darkest night
No direction, not a single hope in sight
When I saw a fire burning brightly through
The storm that raged above
In the shadows of your warm and tender love
I was a stranger to the land and life around
In constant danger, being hurt by what I found
And of hurting what I treasured most
Foolish eagle never dove
Till I fell upon your warm and tender love
In the shadows of your warm and tender love
Now I gaze in peace at the lonely sky
That is raging high above
Safe in the shadows of your warm and tender, tender love
In the shadows of your warm and tender loveEmbed
