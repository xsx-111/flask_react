Daytona LyricsDiamond dream when the sun don't shine
I close my eyes to see
Twelve wild horses in silver chains
Callin' out to me
Ooh Daytona
Shine your light on me
Ooh Daytona
Shine your light on me
Now she ain't easy
So you take good care
Or she will scream down on your lust
She can please you
Like no other
Or she can leave you eating dust
Ooh Daytona
Shine your light on me
Burning passion
Light my day
Let me sit inside your wonder
Cloudless daydream
Oh dance of dances
To have tamed the sound of thunder
Ooh Daytona
Shine your light on me
Ooh DaytonaEmbed
