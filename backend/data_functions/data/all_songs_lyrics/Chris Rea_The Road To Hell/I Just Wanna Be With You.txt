I Just Wanna Be With You LyricsI just wanna be with you
No matter what they say
Just wanna be with you
Every night and every day
Cold nights, dark days
I wanna be with you
I just wanna be with you
Till the final curtain falls
Just wanna be with you
Then know nothing at all
Cold nights, dark days
I wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
I know there's a price to pay
For doing what we do
But I just wanna be with you
Just wanna be with you
Don't wanna hold you down
Whatever that you do
Shine on, sweet angel
'Cos I just wanna be with you
I wanna be with youEmbed
