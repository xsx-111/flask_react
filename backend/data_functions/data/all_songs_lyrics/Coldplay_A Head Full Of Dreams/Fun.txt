Fun Lyrics
I know it's over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits for a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh

From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
But, come on, don't give up, don't say we give in
Don't say it's over, don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
I know it's over before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
"I know it's over," Icarus says to the Sun
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight til it's over, fight til it's done
Ah-ah-ah

But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh

From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopped it in its tracks
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

'Cause you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

But then, maybe we could again8Embed
