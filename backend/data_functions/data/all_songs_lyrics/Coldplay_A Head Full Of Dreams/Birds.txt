Birds Lyrics
Been standing in the corner, studying the lights
The dreaming of escape will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up and got me in the rays
So I guess I’d better stay
‘Uh uh no come on’ you say

It's a fools gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start 'What if
I won’t see you again’
Around here you never want to sleep all night
So start falling in love, start the riot and

Come on rage with me
We don’t need words
And we’ll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing, but geography
Come on and raise it
Come on and raise this noise for the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on it’s not over if you mean it, say loud
Come on all for love, out from the underground

Away with me
We don’t need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds, flying free
Holding on in the mystery
Fearless, fearless, fearless

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Fearless together
You said ‘we’ll go through this together’

When you fly won’t you
Won’t you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you’re so cool7Embed
