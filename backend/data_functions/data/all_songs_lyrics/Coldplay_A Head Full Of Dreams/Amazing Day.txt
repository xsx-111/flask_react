Amazing Day Lyrics
We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"

And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and its weight"
And here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day

We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place where you can be who you are

And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms, I just wanna sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh
And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
"Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?"
Oh thanks God, mustâ€™ve heard when I prayed
Cause now I always want to feel this way

Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today7Embed
