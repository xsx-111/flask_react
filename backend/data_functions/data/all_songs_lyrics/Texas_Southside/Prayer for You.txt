Prayer for You LyricsAll I see is the truth now
That's all I want you to know
That I'll never turn my back on you
And leave you out there on your own
I could never hide my feelings
I could never let you fall
And I want you to remember
All the love that I've found
Oh I say a prayer
A prayer for you
Oh for you
I could never make a promise
I'd only break it in the end
Then you're looking for the answers
You'd never trust in me again
I could never watch you suffer
I could never let you down
And I hope you soon discover
All the truth that I've now found
Oh I say a prayer
A prayer for you
Oh for you
Oh I say a prayer
A prayer for you
Oh for youEmbed
