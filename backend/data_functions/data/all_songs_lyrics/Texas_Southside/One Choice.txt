One Choice LyricsThere's only one reason left for me to stay
But you won't like the reason why
Tried so many times to get through the two of you
But you don't even want to try
Times are hard and people need all they have got
Look around and see what's left today
Ain't so easy making it on your own
What more do I need to say
There's only one choice to be made
And I can't help it
If you take the wrong way
Never knew a good thing
Till it moved away
Now it's too late to turn it back
You'd buy the world if it would make me stay
Listen now to what I have to say
There's only one choice to be made
And I can't help it
If you take the wrong way
There's only one choice to be made
And I can't help it
If you take the wrong way
Sitting here thinking
But nothing seems to change
And I can't stand it anymore
There's always someone trying to pull you down
Do you really want this constant war
There's only one choice to be made
And I can't help it
If you take the wrong way
There's only one choice to be made
And I can't help it
If you take the wrong wayEmbed
