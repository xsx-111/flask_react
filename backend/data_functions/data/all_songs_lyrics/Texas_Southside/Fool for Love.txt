Fool for Love LyricsHave you heard the sound of disappointment
It tears at you
Why didn't I realise that I could be conned by you
Taken for a fool
But as the lights go down
There's no one left around
What will you do
Now you've hurt me
I won't let you stay
No matter what you say to me now
I won't let you stay
No matter what you say to me now
Hear what I'm saying it's not what I'm thinking
My head is like a chain of thoughts
Twisted in vain
When will you ever learn
That it's always the hard way
Now that we're through
I've nothing left to prove
To convince you
To convince you
I won't let you stay
No matter what you say to me now
I won't let you stay
No matter what you say to me now
I won't let you stay
No matter what you say to me now
You never cared what happened
Now you're the one whose laughing
Fool for love
Those rumors were true I was your fool
I won't let you stay
No matter what you say to me now
I won't let you stay
No matter what you say to me nowEmbed
