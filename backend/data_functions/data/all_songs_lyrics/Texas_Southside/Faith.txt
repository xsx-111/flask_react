Faith LyricsBelieve in
In what I'm saying
It's so much harder
When it's you who is listening
When I see suspicion in your eyes
You know it hurts me
It turns my head around
No words could explain
You've got to have faith in me
Nothing left to lose
You've got to have faith in me
Nothing left to lose
I'm gonna prove myself true to you somehow
Have faith
Deceiving
Deceiving only you
Why should I care
When it means nothing to you
When I see life coming closer
I turn and pray
Was it all in vain
Will my world change
You've got to have faith in me
You've nothing left to lose
You've got to have faith in me
You've nothing left to lose
I'm gonna prove myself true to you somehow
Have faith
Oh pleasing you has proven to be
To be my weakest link yeh
But if I change no place is safe
Safe from a piece of mind
You've got to have faith in me
You've nothing left to lose
Please have faith in me
You've nothing left to lose
You've got to have faith in me
I'm gonna prove myself true to you somehow
Have faith
You've got to have faith in meEmbed
