Fight the Feeling LyricsI've looked down the saddest city lane
I've looked at the people with faces of pain
I can't forget it
I can't forget it
I looked into your eyes
You think it just a game
Their faces keep on looking
But it's all in vain
I can't forget it
I can't forget it
Fight the feeling
Show me your strenght
Fight the feeling
You've got to fight to the end
You keep telling me my mind is too cruel
But I can't help it if I live by these rules
You'll never change them
You'll never change them
You took me for a fool
And read my thoughts
You never realised that I couldn't be bought
I can't forget it
You will regret it
Fight the feeling
Show me your strenght
Fight the feeling
You've got to fight to the end
You can only push me so far
Before I can't take no more
I've made the vow
You've lost me now
Don't push me so far
Fight the feeling
Show me your strenght
Fight the feeling
You've got to fight to the endEmbed
