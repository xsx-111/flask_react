Tell Me Why LyricsEven now I can see that day
The fear in your eyes
Tell me why
Were you so afraid
Somethings they turn out this way
Fire the bullet and find
That you don't know what you left behind
When we laid you to rest
Tell me why were you so afraid
Tell me why were you so afraid
You walk this line
You walk this line of hate
Where to people are so blind
Blind to the evil it creates
Never say to much
Never think out loud
Tell me why were you so afraid
Tell me why were you so afraid
I know one day you'll find a way
To heal the wounds
I know one day you'll find a way
To heal the wounds
Tell me why were you so afraid
Even now I can see that day
The fear in your eyes
You gave all you lived for
Whilst you kept your pride
Tell me why were you so afraid
Tell me why were you so afraidEmbed
