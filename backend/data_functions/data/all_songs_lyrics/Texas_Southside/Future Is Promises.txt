Future Is Promises LyricsI saw him today at the station
There was something on his mind
I felt I was on the devil's mission
Trying to steal him from a friend
I know it hurts you
And you can't ask why
I know it hurts you
Takes a train to cry
Your only future is promises
For so many years
Your only future is promises
I know you can make it if you try
You've been living life in the past
I'm gonna reach out I'm gonna grab your heart
You've been living life in the eyes of a stranger
You've gotta free your mind
Cause I want to get nearer
You're only future is promises
For so many years
You're only future is promises
I know you can make it if you try
Take the chance and make the move
But I don't think that I will approve
For once I've finally realised
Being with her wasted your life
Your only future is promises
For so many years
Your only future is promises
I know you can make it if you try
You only future is promises
For so many years
Your only future is promises
I know you can make it if you tryEmbed
