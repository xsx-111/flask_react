In the Meantime Lyrics
Tonight I wish I had someone to love me
Tomorrow, who knows how I'm gonna feel
But tonight, I wish I had someone beside me

But in the meantime, I don't have no one
That I can make love to
I don't have no one to satisfy me
But in the meantime, I'll make due what I have

Today I'm glad that I'm alone
Tomorrow, who knows how I'm gonna feel
But today I'm glad
There's no tears and no sorrow

But in the meantime, I don't have no one
That I can talk to
I don't have no one to understand me
But in the meantime, I'll make due what I have
But in the meantime, I'll make due what I have
But in the meantime, I'll make due what I haveEmbed
