Anti Love Song Lyrics
No, I don’t wanna love you
'Cause I know how you are
That’s why I’ve been staying away from you
That’s why I haven’t called you
'Cause I know you could possess my body
I know you could make me scrawl
I know could have me shaking
I know you could have me climbing walls
That’s why I don’t wanna love you
'Cause I know how you are
Sure you say you’re right on and you’re righteous
But with me I’d know you’d be right off
'Cause you know I could possess your body too, don’t cha?
You know I could make you crawl

And just as hard as I’d fall for you, boy
Well, you know you’d fall for me harder
That’s why I don’t wanna love you

'Cause I’d know what you’d do to my heart
You’d scorch it just like a hot iron
Leave me burning alone in the dark
'Cause I know you’d could make me suffer
I know you could drive me mad
I know you’d just take me in a circle
And when it got real I know you’d disappear
That’s why I ain’t gonna love you
'Cause I know you like to be in charge
But with me you know you couldn’t control me, don’t cha?
'Cause you know I’d make you drop your guard
'Cause I’d have you eating your ego
I’d make you pocket your pride

And just as hard as I’d be loving you, boy
Well, you know you’d be loving me harder
That’s why I don’t wanna love you

No, no, no
I said I don’t wanna love you
No, no, no, no, no, no
I said I ain’t gonna
No, no, no
I said I don’t wanna
No, no, no, no, noEmbed
