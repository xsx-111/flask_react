Steppin In Her I. Miller Shoes Lyrics
Steppin' high in her I. Miller shoes

She could’ve been anything that she wanted
A cutie thing from her head down to her toes
Instead she chose to be nothing!
So nothing flew from the East to the West Coast
Became a fiend! She was a dancer!
Became a harlet! She was a black Donna queen!
Music men wrote songs about her
Some sad, some sweet, some said were very mean
Rock music played loud and clear for her
Rock music took her youth and left her very dry
She was used and abused by many men
He'll tell her why
Tell her!
Tell her!

She could've been anything that she wanted
She had bells from her head down to her toes
Instead she choose to be nothing!
So nothing flew from the West back to the East Coast
She rendered her services egerly!
Because certain services were all she had to give
And after the passing of a savior
She went and tried everything she could to stay here
A dark mask used to hide her morning face
A dark mask from her face upon her arms
And when they told me that she had died
They didn’t have to tell me why or how she'd gone
I knew!
I knew!

She came to the jungle from Milwaukee!
Steppin' high in her I. Miller Shoes!
She was steppin'! Oh, in her I. Miller Shoes
She came to the jungle from Milwaukee!
Steppin' low in her I. Miller Shoes!
She was steppin'! Oh, in her I. Miller shoes
She came to the jungle from Milwaukee!
She sat down in her I. Miller shoes!
She was steppin'! Oh, In her I. Miller shoes
She was steppin'! Oh, In her I. Miller shoes
Steppin!
She was steppin’! Oh, In her I. Miller shoesEmbed
