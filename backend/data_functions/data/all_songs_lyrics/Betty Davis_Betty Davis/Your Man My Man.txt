Your Man My Man Lyrics
San Francisco, New York, in between
Your man, my man, what does it mean?
You care, I share, who's to blame
He's your man, he's my man, it's all the same
'Cause he's yours, all yours, when he's there
He's mine, I have him, when he's here
You cry, I sigh, what does it mean?
He's your man, he's my man, it's all the same

Chicago, Detroit, in between
Your man, my man, what does it mean?
You believe, he deceives, who's to blame?
He's your man, he's my man, it's all the same
'Cause you need him, you please him
When he's there
I free him, I release him, when he's here
You love him, I love him, what does it mean?
He's your man, he's my man, it's all the same

He's my man (He's my man)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's my man (He's my man)
He don't belong to you, girl
He's my man (He's my man)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's my man (He's my man)
You don't have papers on him, girl
He's my man (He's my man)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's my man (He's my man)
He likes to mess around, girl
He's your man, he's my man
(You better stay away from him, girl)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's your man, he's my man
(Do you hear what I'm sayin', yeah)
He's your man, he's my man
(You better stay away from him, girl)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's your man, he's my man
(And I ain't playin', yeah)
He's your man, he's my man
(You better stay away from him, girl)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's your man, he's my man
(Oh I'll never let him go, yeah)
He's your man, he's my man
(You better stay away from him, girl)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's your man, he's my man
('Cause I plan to keep him, yeah)
But you, you'll fight
(Just what I said) Huh?
(I will fight, do you understand?
Judo, black belt, karate, kung-fu
I don't take no mess)
Girl, I don't want to hear it, girl
I don't want to hear it
Don't be tellin' me to stay away from him
'Cause I don't wanna hear it
(I'll jump right off in your)
You don't scare me, you don't scare me!
(Right up where, I'm not tryin' to
You better listen to me, girl)
I don't wanna hear it, I don't wanna hear it
(Yeah listen, you got to)

He's your man, he's my man
(You better stay away from him, girl)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's your man, he's my man
(Do you hear what I'm sayin', yeah)
He's your man, he's my man
(You better stay away from him, girl)
Uh, uh, uh!
He's your man, he's my man
(And I ain't playin', yeah)
No!
He's your man, he's my man
(You better stay away from him, girl)
Uh uh, nuh-uh!
He's your man, he's my man
('Cause I find you keep him, yeah)
He's your man, he's my manEmbed
