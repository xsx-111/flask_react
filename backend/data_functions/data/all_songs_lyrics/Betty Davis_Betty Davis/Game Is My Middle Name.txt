Game Is My Middle Name Lyrics
Rock on, heavy one
Tell me the world is real
Get inside my head
Just mess up my mind
Do me in, do me in
I could dig it now
Do me in, do me in
If you can do it now
Come on, now!
Go on, open up
Your bag of tricks
Anything you've got
To give, I'll take it
You're fine, so fine
Whatever you want that's what I'll be
You're fine, so fine
Your fool, your woman, I'm free
Free

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Game is my middle name
Whatever you wanna play
Said I'll play it with you now
Game is sure 'nuff my middle name
Listen
Go on and deal
Red stop, green go
Follow the leader
Win or lose, I'll show
Come on, now!

Rock on, heavy one
Tell me the world is real
Get inside my head
Just mess up my mind
Do me in, do me in
I could dig it now
Do me in, do me in
If you can do it now
Come on, now!
Go on, open up
Your bag of tricks
Anything you've got
To give, I'll take it
You're fine, so fine
Whatever you want that's what I'll be
You're fine, so fine
Your fool, your woman, I'm free
Free
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Game is my middle name, uh, huh, huh
Whatever you wanna play
You know, I'll play it with you now

Whatever you wanna play, said yeah, I'll play it with you now
