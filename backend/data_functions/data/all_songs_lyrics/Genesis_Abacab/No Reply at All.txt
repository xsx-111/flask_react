No Reply at All LyricsTalk to me, you never talk to me
Ooh, it seems that I can speak
I can hear my voice shouting out
But there's no reply at all
Look at me, you never look at me
Ooh, I've been sitting, staring, seems so long
But you're lookin' through me
Like I wasn't here at all
No reply
There's no reply at all
Dance with me, you never dance with me
Ooh, it seems that I can move
I'm close to you, close as I can get
Yet there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all
I get the feelin' you're tryin' to tell me
Is there somethin' that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be readin' stop or go?
I don't know
Be with me, seems you're never here with me
Ooh, I've been tryin' to get over there
Oh, but it's out of my reach
And there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all
I get the feelin' you're tryin' to tell me
Is there somethin' that I should know?
What excuse are you tryin' to sell me?
Should I be readin' stop or go?
I don't know
Maybe deep down inside
I'm tryin' for no one else but me
Too stubborn to say, "The buck stops here
It's not the one you're lookin' for"
But maybe deep down inside, I'm lyin'
To no one else but me
Oh, but my back is up, I'm on my guard
With all the exits sealed
Listen to me, you never listen to me
Ooh, and it seems there's no way out
I've been tryin' but we cannot connect
And there's no reply at all
There's no reply at all
There's no reply at all
No reply at all
Is anybody list'nin?
Oh, there's no reply at all...2Embed
