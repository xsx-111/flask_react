Like It or Not LyricsOh, don't you know I've been on my own?
But I'm coming home
And I'd like you to be there
I feel a little cold in the air
And you're not anywhere
You're just another face I used to know
But there is still a chance
To hold on to our love
'Cause I gave you everything
Everything I had
Ooh, like it or not, you have done it this time
And like it or not, I've had enough
Ooh, like it or not, there's a lot I could say
'Cause I've got a lot on my mind
It won't be very long
You're just another face
That I once used to know
And I gave you everything
But what have I got to show? Oh, oh
Oh, like it or not, you are out on the street
And like it or not, that's where you will stay
Oh, like it or not, there's another thing, darling
Well, I just could not stand another day
'Cause if you wanna know
There is still a chance
To hold on to our love
'Cause I gave you everything
Everything I had
Everything I had
It's been a long, been a long, long time
Since I held anybody, since I loved anyone
Oh, it's been a long, been a long, long, long time
But if I'm right or if I'm wrong, does it matter anyway?Embed
