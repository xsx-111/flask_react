Dodo LyricsToo big to fly
Dodo ugly, so dodo must die
Dog go, with fear on its side
Can't change, can't change the tide
Dog baiter, agitator
Asking questions, says he wants to know why
Ain't no reason that money can't buy
Mink, he pretty, so mink he must die
Must die, must die
Sun, he giving life in his light
Part of the system
Friend to man and friend to the trees
No friend to the snowman
Where does he go? What does he do?
Does he meet with the mole, the stream, the cloud
And end up at the bottom of the sea?
Fish, he got a hook in his throat
Fish, he got problems
Where does he go? What does he do?
Does he hope he's too small, to poor a haul
Who'll end up bein' thrown back in the sea?
I'm back in the sea
Caretaker, horror movie
Only one eye, only needs one boot
Sweet lady, she know she looks good
Vacuum coming for the bright and the brute
Big noise, black smoke
So pig-headed, couldn't see the joke
But it ain't funny, ask the fly on the wall
It's only living, it don't matter at all
At all, at all
Pimp, he make you drool and grunt
He got an answer
One, he got a dream of love
Deep as the ocean
Where does he go? What does he do?
Will the siren team with Davy Jones
And trap him at the bottom of the sea?
I'm back in the sea
I'm back in the sea
I'm back in the seaEmbed
