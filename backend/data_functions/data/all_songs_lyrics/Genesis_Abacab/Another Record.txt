Another Record LyricsIt's funny, you know
'Cause there's an old rock 'n' roller
He's got nowhere to go
Did you ever think of takin' him in?
Somebody help him, somebody please
Put another record on
'Cause he likes that song
It's funny, you know
He never done nothin', done nobody wrong
Didn't thing about changin' his name
But I'm gonna tell him it's the same old game
Put another record on
Round, round, round and around, oh
Oh, see him smile
Well, lately I've seen him
Walkin' down the street, kinda movin' his feet
Everyone I know looks the other way
Somebody help him, somebody say:
Put another record on
Round, round, round and around, oh
Oh, see him smile
Just put another record onEmbed
