Love Is (What I Say) LyricsThis is
Food of love
Dare say
They got it wrong
Smiling
You and I
Thinking
Never say die
What I say now
What I say now
I don't think we know each other
Enough to lie
Enough is enough anyway
These changes
Lives alone
Drowsing
By the fire
Out of depth
He becomes
A man without
Quality
What I say now
What I say now
I don't think we know each other
Enough to lie
Enough is enough anyway
This life
The food love
This is
They got it wrong
Smiling
You and I
Thinking
Never say die
What I say now
What I say now
I don't think we know each other
Enough to lie
Enough is enough anyway
You and I
What I sayEmbed
