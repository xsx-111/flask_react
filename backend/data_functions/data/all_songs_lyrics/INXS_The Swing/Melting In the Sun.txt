Melting In the Sun Lyrics
I'm melting in the sun
And this is what they call the life
I suppose too much sun
Makes a desert Arab say
And I really love this country
There's a lot I wanna see

Great expectations
Of all we seem to be
And the winner
And the winner, the winner

Do you wanna make a story up?
There's enough it always seems
If it happened this morning
Tonight we'll see it on TV

Great expectations
Of all we seem to be
Great expectations (Take a look around you, take a look around you)
Of all we seem to be (Take a look around you, take a look)
And the winner
And the winner, the winner
She was twelve and knew the world
Her boyfriend knew a dance to this
Everybody's got advice
Take a snake, take a ladder
And this is what they call the life
I'm melting in the sun

Great expectations
Of all we seem to be
Great expectations (Take a look around you, take a look around you)
Of all we seem to be (Take a look around you, take a look)
And the winner
And the winner, the winnerEmbed
