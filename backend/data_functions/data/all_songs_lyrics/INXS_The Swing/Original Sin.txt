Original Sin Lyrics
You might know of the original sin
And you might know how to play with fire
But did you know of the murder committed
In the name of love - yeah
You thought what a pity

Dream on white boy
Dream on black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

There was a time when I did not care
And there was a time when the facts did stare
There is a dream and it's held by many
Well I'm sure you had to see
It's open arms

Dream on white boy
Dream on black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away
Dream on black boy
Dream on white girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away
Dream on black boy
Dream on white girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams are washed away
Dream on, play with fire
White boy, black girl
Dream on, in the name of love
Black boy, white girl
Dream on, white boy, black girl
Black boy, white girl
Dream on, the name of love - yeah
You thought what a pity
