Dancing On the Jetty LyricsWatch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's going to teach me
Peace and happiness
We could sit here forever
Just never get old
Listen to the world
Letting God's tyres down
Hit cities, sharp nights
Rag clothing
Dancing on the jetty
So our feet stay dry
Watch the world argue
Argue with themselves
Who's going to teach me
Peace and happiness
Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's going to teach me
Peace and happiness
Blood is upon the steps
Two thousand years ago
Pray like hell then we go to fight
Another war in a holy land
Shot the world
True story
Snap decision
In a moment's glory
We're gonna watch them keeping it strong
Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's going to teach me
Peace and happiness
Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's going to teach me
Peace and happiness
We're making trouble
We change tracks
Fool the system
Take time to take notice
Hit city
Sharp nights
Rag clothing
Dancing on the Jetty
Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's going to teach me
Peace and happiness
Watch the world argue
Argue with itself
Who's going to teach me
Peace and happinessEmbed
