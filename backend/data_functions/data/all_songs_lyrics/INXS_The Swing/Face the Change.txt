Face the Change LyricsTurns back to front
Turns hate to love
The simple things that mean a lot
Turns rock to sand
Turns ice to snow
It's you and me about to grow
Change the face of a magazine
Face the change of a million years
Stare in shock at what you saw
Take a breath, better lock the door
Tell your children what to do
Mistakes and all they still love you
Change the face of a magazine
Face the change of a million years
Turns rough to smooth
Turns don't to do
To reminisce turns me to you
Turns war to peace
Turns greed to need
The consequence of visionaries
Change the face of a magazine
Face the change of a million years
Stare in shock at what you saw
Take a breath, better lock the door
Tell your children what to do
Mistakes and all they still love you
Change the face of a magazine
Face the change of a million years
Turns back to front
Turns hate to love
The simple things that mean a lot
Turns rock to sand
Turns ice to snow
It's you and me about to grow
Change the face of a magazine
Face the change of a million years
Stare in shock at what you saw
Take a breath, better lock the door
Tell your children what to do
Mistakes and all they still love you
Change the face of a magazine
Face the change of a million yearsEmbed
