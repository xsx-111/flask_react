The Swing LyricsIt's the swing
It's the swing like a pendulum
It marks the moments as the years go by on an innocent face
The swing, into never never land
There was a darkness like an old friend
That scratched and crawled up the wall
Into my life
Into my destiny
Into my desire
It's the swing
It's the swing like a pendulum
So look behind you when the race has run
And the winner is made
The swing into never never land
There was a darkness like an old friend
That scratched and crawled up the wall
Into my life
Well it's the swing
The swing like a pendulum
Between the kisses and between the lines
There is nothing to hide
The swing into never never land
There was a darkness like an old friend
That scratched and crawled up the wall
Into my life
Into my destiny
Into my desire
Yeah, the swing
It's the swing like a pendulum
It's the swing
It's the swing like a pendulum
It's the swingEmbed
