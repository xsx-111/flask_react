Heart Like a Levee LyricsSweet May morning
Lying in bed with nothing to say
We'll pretend all we wanna
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be on my way
Sing me a river
Go easy on me, I'm not doing too well
Do you hate me, honey
As much as I hate myself?
Heart like a levee
I swing for the mountains in double-time
Is it too heavy, honey?
Did I carry my piece of the fire?
Standing in the wake with the sky still changing
What's it going to take to keep you missing the rambling rake with a heart of obsidian?
Standing in the wake with the sky still changing
Sing me a river
I'm a peach tree jumper with rain in my shoes
If you let me, honey
I'll set the world on fire for you
Sing me a summer
Oh, that Cincinnati moon - like a wheel in the sky - shows two roads, honey
Tell me which one leads to mine?
Sing, little sister
Be patient with me when I don't have a rhyme
Will you grieve me, honey?
Did I give you a reason to try?
Standing in the wake with the sky still changing
What's it going to take to keep you from taking this so serious?
I know the dead are raging
Standing in the wake - yes I've seen the changes
Heart like a levee
I swing for the mountains in double-time
Do you hear me running?
Did I carry my piece of the fire?Embed
