Like a Mirror Loves a Hammer LyricsYes, in the dark of the day
I want to give it all away
Tear this high mountain down
And keep nothing for myself
If you go - go by
Build a wall I cannot climb
Fix a lock I cannot break
Oh, a mirror loves a hammer
When the river's running backwards
Do the dance of many colors
They call us to keep moving
Yes, babe - I can feel it
I'm watching your dark legs
Flashing like some battlefield
Should I drown in the Atlanta rain?
Yes, babe - I can't stand it
In the dew of the dawn
I want to call and blow my horn
Yes, beat this mountain down
And give nothing to myself
Yes, one more time around
Tell me that you need me now
Tell me that you love me still
Like a mirror loves a hammer
I'm gonna run to the city of Refuge
See the spirit in the water
Now the servant calls the masterEmbed
