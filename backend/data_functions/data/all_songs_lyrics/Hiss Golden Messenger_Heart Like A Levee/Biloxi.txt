Biloxi LyricsI was born on the Junco River
Where the dragon surely dwells
And Saint George stood with a mighty word
And told it well
Hey, babe, it's your birthday
My sweet little one
Six years old and truth be told
You're the only one
It's hard, Lord
Lord, it's hard
It's hard, Lord
Lord, it's hard
Yes, everybody in the whole damn place has gotta have a good time
Yeah, nah nah
Say Biloxi
It's tough all over
Ah, Houston
You scared me sober
But all around my old hometown I was known as a loner
Oh you know I wasn't lonely, I just liked being alone
It's hard, Lord
Lord, it's hard
It's hard, Lord
Lord, it's hard
Oh, everybody in the whole damn place has gotta have a good time
Yeah, nah nah nah nah
Oohoohoohoohooh
Oohoohoohoohooh
Oohoohoohoohooh
I was down by the Junco River
Where the dragon surely dwells
And Saint George stood with a mighty word
And told it well
It's hard, Lord
Lord, it's hard
It's hard, Lord
Lord, it's hard
There's one way in and there's one way out and we're gonna have a good timeEmbed
