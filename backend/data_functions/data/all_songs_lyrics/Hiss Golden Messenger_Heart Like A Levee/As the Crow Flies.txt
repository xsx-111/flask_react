As the Crow Flies LyricsVicksburg
Plaquemine
Issaquena, Rosedale, True Vine
21 years
As the crow flies
Watching the wheels roll backwards
Lucinda in the evening
Long-legged girl with a country way of speaking
Red apple moon
Oh, river, I'm gone - hey
Pull the needle and thread
Sing little bird
Sing for high summer
Don't get down
You're nothing but a number
Woodstock
Storm King
West Saugerties in the pouring rain
Rider Waite - low card
Walt Whitman Bridge, daylight be thy name
Rented rooms
Little shinbone child - was that you?
Blue horizon - late again
West Lafayette, babe
And tomorrow's a dream
Sing little bird
Sing for high summer
Don't get down
You're nothing but a numberEmbed
