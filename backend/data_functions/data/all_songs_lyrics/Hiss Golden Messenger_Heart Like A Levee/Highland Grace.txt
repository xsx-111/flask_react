Highland Grace LyricsYes, and then there came a stranger
Call her Highland Grace
A rearranger
I'd been searching in the mirror, but seeing my own face didn't make it any clearer
I'd rage against the hard times while others smiled to say, "Hey, take it easy."
Yes and lo, this little angel was standing in the rain
Oh, just what I needed
Yes and ain't that just like a Saturday child?
Bound for Avalon with the birds 'round her head
She loves with the love of a gentle child
I was a fool of the rule before I met her
Yes, good morning, Matokie
Tell me about those great expectations
When I set the river on fire
You laughed in my face
When things got dire
Yea, and sleep went to slaughter
I saw you drift away, farther and farther
Yes, my eyes pinned like diamonds, head of smoke for days
I loved you, little liar
Yes and ain't that just like a Saturday child?
Bound for Avalon with the birds 'round her head
She loves with the love of a gentle child
Hey, fool of the rule
Not everything's for sale
And if you can't buy it
You can stand and deny it
And if you can't see it
Will you refuse to believe it?
And if you can't count it
Oh you can't help but doubt it
But loving her was easy
The easiest thing in the world
Oh loving her was easy
The easiest thing in the world
Oh loving her was easy
The easiest thing in the world1Embed
