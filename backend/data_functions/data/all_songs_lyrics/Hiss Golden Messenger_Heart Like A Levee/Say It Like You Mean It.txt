Say It Like You Mean It LyricsSay it like you mean it
If you don't mean it, it don't mean nothing at all
We've been strugglers
Blackhearts brothers
Sunday's mothers never could tell us apart
Now I know what you say:
It's a mean old world
I've seen it, it all seems like a game
I want a new, new river every time I look down
Oh, a spirit to move me, babe
Desire
Like a wire
Lead the choir
Tripping on that Orange County wine
Morning sinner
Meet your maker
Revelator
You tell me yours and I'll tell you mine
Now I know what you say:
It's a mean old world
I've seen it, it all seems like a game
I want a new, new river every time I look down
Oh, a spirit to move me, babe
Say it like you mean it
If you don't mean it, it don't mean nothing at allEmbed
