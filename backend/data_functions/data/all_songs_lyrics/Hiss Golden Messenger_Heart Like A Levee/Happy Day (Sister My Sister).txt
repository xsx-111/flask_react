Happy Day (Sister My Sister) LyricsTake all of the grace
And all of the sorrow
Put it on me
Set it free
For a moment
Just a moment
Can I carry it?
O happy day
Thank you, my spirit
But these games we play
Say what you mean
When we talk, we crosstalk
Why do we do it?
I was just a fool
A real stone fool
So let me be your fool
I'm not hurting anybody
Brother, my brother
Sweet, serious boy
You remembered me all these years
You had to wait, I know you waited, I know you waited
Am I good for it?
Sister, my sister
What should I do?
Should I wade in that river?
With so many people living just
Just above the waterline?
I was just a fool
A real stone fool
So let me be your fool
I'm not hurting anybody
Mother, my mother
What should I do?
Do I walk on the water?
With so many people living just
Just above the waterline?Embed
