Passiona Lyrics
The people in the apartments across the street
Literally and metaphorically look down on me
Tangled in tenderness, why do I have to live like this?
I was tempted by your company and you've already noticed me
And I'm sorry for what I say when I don't know what I'm saying
And you don't have to play this cat-and-mouse game I am playing
I'm just a pretty sad person in a quite surreal place
And I don't look up from my phone
Because I know I won't see your face
And it's pathetic, it's also not a competition

And I'm absolutely, infinitely
More scared of you than you are of me
And I've always been the one that cares too much

And I hope you're happy, I hope you've slept
I'll try not write another record about the pain in my chest
I'm just so glad I could be someone that you wanted
And I don't recognise these stars, I'm unfamiliar with this skyline
I was born and bred in bars
Now nothing man-made is in my eye line
Turn and walk back to the house that they saved after the war
And I am questioned once again
Get asked what I would do that for
And our host tells me I'm sick, tentatively hands me a spliff
And I know he's forgotten my name, but I don't remember his
And I'm absolutely, infinitely
More scared of you than you are of me
And I've always been the one that cares too much

And oh God, if only it was that easy
To run from what I've achieved, I've let it define me
I'm having panic attacks on German TV
This is not work ethic, it's survival technique
And there's nothing I can really do
So I sit in the band room, start fights to get attention from you
There is nothing I am qualified or smart enough to do
Sit in the band room and start fights to get attention from you

And I walk off into the corn field, every cut's a new relief
I might stop talking altogether if you stop talking to me
And if I'm really supposed to be here
Why has no one come to that conclusion?
I'm out of place amongst the band boys
I can't suspend disillusion
And music industry professionals
Yeah, they can all go and fuck themselves
And it's just me and Chris
But he's stoned as shit and passin' out
That was okay once, for some reason, it's sad now
For some reason, it's sad now
For some reason, it's sadEmbed
