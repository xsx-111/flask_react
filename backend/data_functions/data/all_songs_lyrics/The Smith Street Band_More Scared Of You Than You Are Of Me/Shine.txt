Shine Lyrics
Finally not waking up dreaming of your ghost
And music is for everyone
Why was I always the last to know?
No idea how hard it was to get this close
With all this extra baggage
And a graft that will not accept the host
These tattered coat-tails, these torn tennis shoes
I am not smarter than many
But I do think that I'm smarter than you
Dappled sunlight that the warm air reciprocates
You look up long enough to notice
But not long enough to appreciate that

Down here in the flight path
Down here in the flight path, we do our best
Down here in the flight path, we do our best
To keep our heads up

I'll sing loud at water falling on stones
I want well-timed time with friends
And well-timed time that I'll spend alone
Throw my body into insignificant positions
I'm gonna make more starts
Complete more chances and more finishes
Fly through the world like a whirling dervish in a hurricane
Take off my clothes and run screaming in the pouring rain
Kiss people even when I'm pretty sure it's a mistake
And try to find a love that not for a second I'll have to fake
Down here in the flight path
Down here in the flight path, we do our best
Down here in the flight path, we do our best
To keep our heads
Down here in the flight path
Down here in the flight path, we do our best
Down here in the flight path, we do our best
To keep our heads

And the sun will rise
In the same place every day
It would be arrogant to think
That we could change anything
Except maybe block its rays
But who would wanna do that anyway?
And I will rise
In a different place almost every day
It would be arrogant to think (It would be arrogant to think)
That we could change anything (That we could change anything)
But if you're here to block my rays
You're gonna have to get the fuck out of my way

'Cause I will shine on you
Like it was the only thing I ever wanted to do
I will shine on you
Like it was the only thing that ever mattered
And all I was put on this earth to do
I will shine on you
One day it's gonna spit me out
But I just gotta stick my landing
Be okay with being talked about
It's hard to not feel loved right now
Let's wrap our arms around each other
Shake our imperfect bodies around
One day it's gonna spit me out
But I just gotta stick my landing
Be okay with being talked about
It's hard to not feel loved right now
Let's wrap our arms around each other
Shake our imperfect bodies around

Down here in the flight path
Down here in the flight path, we do our best
Down here in the flight path, we do our best
To keep our heads1Embed
