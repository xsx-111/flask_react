Run into the World Lyrics
Like the drive home from a 30-hour flight
Part of me wants to be dead
Part of me's so happy to be alive
When you start crying in the middle of a fight
I never wanna see you sad
But that does not mean that you are right
And I wake and I pace around the bed
Doesn't mean I can't be near you
But being alive makes me stressed
You fall asleep as I'm patting your head
In mine, I am repeating, "I'm glad we are not dead
I'm glad we are not dead"

If you need me I'll come running
Would have thought that I'd proved that
Can divide our despair
Could've conquered our sad, and

Run into the world, run into the world
Run into the world

I don't think it's cool that you started 'cause it is what I sing about
I'm learning not to romanticise destroying tissue with self-doubt
Take time to appreciate what's in between
When the medicine wears off, and when the sleeping pills kick in
And If you need me I'll come running
Would have thought that I'd proved that
Can divide our despair
Could've conquered our sad, and

Run into the world, run into the world
Run into the world
Run into the world, run into the world
Run into the world

And if you think you can take it
Go on, just take it all

It's like I'm running for the train that will hit me
Stayed up all night for a sun that won't rise
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
If nothing gets better, neither will I
And I'll do this so much better next time
I'll do this so much better next time
I'll do this so much better next time
I'll do this so much better next time

Run into the world, and run into the world
Run into the world
Run into the world, run into the world
Run into the world

And if you think you can take it
Go on, just take it all1Embed
