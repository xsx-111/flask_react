25 Lyrics
It was so cold in the top room
But I didn't wanna risk waking you
So I let it sit in my feet and my fingers
With everything I burn, the dull ache, it lingers
And I don't know if I'll be able to complete
What other people do each day without noticing
And I don't know if I'll be able to compete
With the way I feel these days about almost everything

One bad week for a life of breathing
A few nights lay awake for an eternity of sleeping
I wanna feel it now
Cough me in, breathe me in and spit me out

I am someone in your passenger's seat
I'm your punching bag
I will let you kick the shit outta me
And I'll hold your hand
I'll be whatever you tell me to be
And I'll understand

Breathing out cold air in my own house
And wondering why I could not afford a solution to that by now
And I'm sure everything seems romantic
In reality, it's uncomfortable to deal with
Falling asleep every other afternoon
To the sound of being alone and having nothing to do
And I'm sure moving in straight away made you feel safe
But it probably wasn't great for my mental state
And one bad week for a life of breathing
A few nights lay awake for an eternity of sleeping
Wanna feel it now
Cough me in, breathe me in and spit me out

I am someone in your passenger's seat
I'm your punching bag
I will let you kick the shit outta me
While I hold your hand
I'll be whatever you tell me to be
And I'll understand

If I can't see
A future for you without evil
A future for me without you will
Only make it better
So I start hoping
Then I stop smoking
Because the ducks are in a row and
This is my best chance to get my shit together

When I turned twenty-five, I was terrified
Still haven't learnt to do the dishes
My mum was my age when I became alive
So I stopped hoping and I quit smoking
Because the writing's on the wall
And it's been there for a while
And it sure is nice to remember things, yeah

I am someone in your passenger's seat
I'm your punching bag
I'll let you kick the living shit outta me
And I'll hold your hand
I am whatever you tell me to be
And I understandEmbed
