Laughing (Or Pretending to Laugh) Lyrics
Woke up laughing on a hardwood floor
In a five-storey walk, up somewhere in New York
Still smiling from laying out on the roof
Still smiling from opening my eyes and looking at you
And if I walk around Brooklyn with my headphones in
Hot cup of coffee that I spill while I'm air-drumming
Will I one day bump into you as if by accident
See if you wanna go somewhere and get a drink?

'Cause I've been laughing or pretending to laugh
I've been crying or pretending to cry
But I could stand on this corner
And watch you walk my way for the rest of my life
I've been laughing or pretending to laugh
I've been crying or pretending to cry
But I could stand on this corner
And watch you walk my way for the rest of my life

And it was snowing when we drove back through the city
Wanted to climb up on your fire escape
And kiss you on your pretty face
But I lay in the van and I stared into space
Half-smiling, half-flying, half-asleep, half-awake
And I just really needed you to know
That you don't have to wait out this snow alone
And maybe I am just a reminder of home
But I still think we made each other feel something good
And I've been laughing or pretending to laugh
I've been crying or pretending to cry
But I could stand on this corner
And watch you walk my way for the rest of my life
I've been laughing or pretending to laugh
I've been crying or pretending to cry
But I could stand on this corner
And watch you walk my way for the rest of my life

And I don't wanna marry you just yet
But at least let me get you a cider
And I don't even think I'd have to pay for it
Hopefully, there's a couple left on the rider
And just because I've got a lot to learn
Does not mean that I am inherently a piece of shit
Just because I don't think I know everything
Doesn't mean that I don't know anything
And I don't wanna marry you just yet
Although it'd probably help with my visa
And can we just continue having this conversation?
I'll just go and get us both a Bacardi Breezer
And just because I've got a lot to learn
Does not mean that I am inherently a piece of shit
Just because I don't think I know everything
Doesn't mean that I don't know anythingEmbed
