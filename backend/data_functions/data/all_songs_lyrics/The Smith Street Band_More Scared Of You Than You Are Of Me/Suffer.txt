Suffer Lyrics
Young love is just practice for a far more ancient
And hopefully successful bond
Between someone who is scared
And someone that they've incorrectly assumed to be strong
You only want me when I've got my keys in my hand
And I'm looking for my wallet and I'm lacing up my shoes
You only want me to change when the way that I have
Always been has a new negative effect on you

The unlucky over-achiever
Cannot help but throw rocks at my parents' house
I entertain myself with people I've never liked
And motherfuckers that till now I've only spoken about

Go forth and suffer for your art
If it's all you look for, you will always find the dark

I'm lonely and angry and desperate
I smashed up my furniture, broke my finger doing it
I'm half-crying, half-laughing and half-pissed
And I wanna fuck everybody in the supermarket
Everyone is so proud of their own self-reliance
Right up until the cheque comes and you have to pay for dinner
Everyone is so perfect and so open-minded
Till you have a conversation where you are not the winner, and
The unlucky over-achiever
Cannot help but throw rocks at my parents' house
Entertain myself with people I've never liked
And motherfuckers until now I've only spoken about

Go forth and suffer for your art
If it's all you look for, you will always find the dark
Go forth and suffer for your art
If it's all you look for, you will always find the dark

You're the worst thing that ever happened to me

Go forth and suffer for your art
If it's all you look for you will always find the dark
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
Go forth and suffer for your art
If it's all you look for you will always find the dark
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
You're the worst thing that ever happened to me
You're the worst thing that ever happened to meEmbed
