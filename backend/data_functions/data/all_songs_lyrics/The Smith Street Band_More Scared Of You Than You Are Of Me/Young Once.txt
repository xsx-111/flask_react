Young Once Lyrics
Go for it

I was so damn clever in my own little world
Gone and made the perfect gesture for the perfect girl
But nothing ever really works out like that
On the day and the day after
The feeling of disaster that I've truly got to know
In the months since I came home
Came back, nothing ever really works out like that

And we were young once
So was everyone
I guess something about it felt important

If I could remember the name of everyone I'd kissed
Does that mean they'd remember mine?
Was there something in that momentary bliss?
Such a beautiful waste of time
Today we sat together like the family we had made
And it was real and it was something and we ate off plastic plates
And we all work our dream jobs and I'm not lacking in ambition
I am a building of a person that's scheduled for demolition
And we were young once
So was everyone
I guess something about it felt important
And we were happy once
So was everyone
I guess I never realised it was so important

What if I was right for someone else?
And what if I never learn how to live with myself?
And what if when I leave, you find someone that completes you?
Will that change anything
Or will I turn back into a pattern I'm so used to?
Pattern I'm so used to

And we were young once
So was everyone
I guess something about it felt important
And we were happy once
So was everyone
I guess I never realised it was so important
And we were young once
We were young once
We were young once
Again, again
Again, again
We were happy once
Again, againEmbed
