Forrest Lyrics
She yelled, "Tell Jesus he's a fucking loser
The wedding went better than the party with the city boozers"
Learnt you can't take photos of the stars
The cops will drive you home if you're too drunk to start the car
Drove through late night highways soaked in heavy cloud
Gripped your leg a little tighter when we started spinning out
Sat motionless across both lanes
I looked at you and said, "It's okay! We're okay!"

I wanna kiss you on the mouth
A little bit too hard
It took years to figure out
Who we actually are, woo!

Don't play two shots around here, mate
Pub rules are you deal with whoever you've decided to play
Juddy got back from visiting his cousin in jail
But his cousin had escaped!
You said you didn't want anyone to talk
And I suggested you stopped being so goddamn memorable
Slowly turned around in a muddy clearing
One day back towards the mountain
One step closer to disappearing and I said
I wanna kiss you on the mouth
A little bit too hard
It took years to figure out
Who we actually are
I wanna kiss you on the mouth
A little bit too hard

And pack a bag for the city
Sometimes coming home
Feels more like leaving
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh
Satellites and magnets
Patience and sleep
And I'm staring down the barrel
And you look so good

Toward the fire we will go
Dumb kids on a country road
Payday beers are drunk and thrown
Into next fortnight's overflow
Despite my deeply seeded doubts
Still wanna kiss you on the mouth
I wanna kiss you on the mouth
A little bit too hard
It took years to figure out
Who we actually are
I wanna kiss you on the mouth
A little bit too hardEmbed
