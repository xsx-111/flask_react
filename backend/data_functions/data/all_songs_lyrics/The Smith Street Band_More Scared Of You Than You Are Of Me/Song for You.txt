Song for You Lyrics
Rejection's a constant, bitterness comes with age
Once or twice a lifetime you get days like today
And I hope no one pissed on this milk crate
I hope no pissed on this milk crate
Where there's no tidying up and nothing falls and no one breaks
You can't say I'm disgusting if you don't mean it that way
And I hope no one comes down this laneway
I hope no one comes down this laneway
And I woke up before the sun in the arms of a tough girl
Heard me speaking lately
You've heard me speaking about her and

Last night I said, "I love you" without a hint of fear
Last night I said, "I love you"
Nothing exploded, no one disappeared

And the realisation shatters through me
That I'm the villain in this movie
But I've got no script and no direction
I just want you to let me love you
I just want you to let me love you
I just wanted you to let me
Dialogue is diluted by strangers and thin walls
Little murmur runs through the audience the first time he calls
But you hang up and a sinking feeling falls amongst the crowd
Someone whispers to their wife
"My God, what's she doing now?"
"My future never really mattered much at all"
I mutter to you down a telephone lying on the bathroom floor

And last night I said, "I love you" without fear
Last night I said, "I love you" and I disappeared

And the realisation shatters through me
That I'm the villain in this movie
But I've got no script and no direction
I just want you to let me love you
I just want you to let me love you
I just wanted you to let me

And all I think I'd need to cast off insecurities
Is for you to write something for me
Like I write for you incessantly
But I don't live in your mind the way that you do in mine
And my feet stick to the floor of the shower
But we get evicted in three-quarters of an hour
And you rub papaw on a new tattoo and say
"One day there'll be a song about you"
One day there'll be a song for you
One day there'll be a song about you
One day there'll be a song for you
One day there'll be a song about you

And I know that you hated me that time
But I've made up for that now, haven't I?
Soaked in spotlights
Spitting vitriol without the corresponding kind

One day there'll be a song for you
One day there'll be a song about you
One day there'll be a song for you
One day there'll be a song about you
One day there'll be a song for you
One day there'll be a song about you
One day there'll be a song for you
One day there'll be a song about you
One day there'll be a song for you
One day there'll be a song about you
One day there'll be a song for you
One day there'll be a song about youEmbed
