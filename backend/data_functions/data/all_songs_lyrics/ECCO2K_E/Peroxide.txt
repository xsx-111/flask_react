Peroxide Lyrics
(True friend)

At the bus stop, crushing rocks
(Crush, crush, crush, crush, c-c-crush, crush)
They all stare at me, I don't care at all
(Oh my god, fuck you)
Everywhere I go, they look at me wrong
(What, what the fuck are you looking at?)
Every day go the same, gotta stay strong
(Trust, trust, trust, trust me, it gets so much worse)

Something feels so wrong (Something feels so wrong)
It's the way I look or the way I walk
Why are you scared of me when I'm not so hard?
No peroxide, I stay dark
"Don't go around him, you might get robbed"
Chop off your body parts (Chop, chop, chop)
Chop his arm off and take his watch

(I'm not afraid of anything)
Crush, crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush, crush, crush
At the bus stop, I be crushin' rocks
They all stare at me, I don't care at all
Crush, crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush, crush, crush
(True friend)
At the bus stop, crushing rocks
(Crush, crush, crush, crush, c-c-crush, crush)
They all stare at me, I don't care at all
(Oh my god, fuck you)
Everywhere I go, they look at me wrong
(What, what the fuck are you looking at?)
Every day go the same, gotta stay strong
(Trust, trust, trust, trust me, it gets so much worse)

Something feels so wrong (Something feels so wrong)
It's the way I look or the way I walk
Why are you scared of me when I'm not so hard?
No peroxide, I stay dark
"Don't go around him, you might get robbed"
Chop off your body parts (Chop, chop, chop)
Chop his arm off and take his watch

At the bus stop, I be crushin' rocks
They all stare at me, I don't care at all
(Crush, crush, crush, crush, c-c-crush, crush)
(I'm not afraid of anything)
