Cc Lyrics
I can change the rules
I can change the rules
I can change the rules
So let's do it
I can-can-can
So let's do it
(I'm not afraid of anything)
So let's do it

All my senses are clues
I can change the rules (Change the rules)
So let's do it (Security)
Okay, let's do it
Okay, let's do it
I can change the rules
Break my wrist  (Security)

Break the chain, I change the lock-piece
Break the chain, I change the not-peace
Break the chain, I change the rule
Break the chain, I change the rule
I can-can-can
 (Security)
Okay, let's do it
Droplets meet the surface
Turn to circles
Into circles
Energy is eternal
One with the earth
Universal
Energy is eternal

Break the chain, I change the lock-piece
Break the chain, I change the not-peace
Break the chain, I change the rule
Break the chain, I change the rule
I can-can-can (Yeah)
Let's do it (Let's do it)
Think I can, let's do it

I'm not afraid of anything
Energy is eternal6Embed
