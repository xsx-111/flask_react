Time Lyrics
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop

Absorbs to the core
I wish I fall, I sink through the floor
Unless I lost, I lose nothing more
The more I want, the more loses all
The will is lost, I will kiss the gods
I kill my gods and play God of War
I talk to walls and walk through their doors
I kiss my forehead and dance on my corpse

The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
Absorbs to the core
I wish I fall, I sink through the floor
Unless I lost, I lose nothing more (I'm not afraid of anything)
The more I want, the more loses all
The will is lost, I will kiss the gods
I kill my gods and play God of War
I talk to walls and dance through their doors
I kiss my forehead, dance on my corpse

The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
The clock don't stop
Hey, wake up, get up, stand up
Hey, wake up, get up, stand up
Hey, wake up, get up, stand up
Hey, wake up, get up, stand up8Embed
