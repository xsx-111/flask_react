Fruit Bleed Juice Lyrics
I'm not afraid of anything
True friend
Sweet like juice, sweet like juice
Sweet like juice, sweet like juice
It's sweet like juice, it's sweet like juice
It's sweet like juice, it's sweet like juice (True friend)

It's nothing special
It's sweet like juice (It tastes like juice)
It tastes like nectar (The darkest fruit)
It's sweet like juice (The dark)
I want the sweetest juice, you are the darkest fruit

I drink from you, I drink you
I drink you, I drink you2Embed
