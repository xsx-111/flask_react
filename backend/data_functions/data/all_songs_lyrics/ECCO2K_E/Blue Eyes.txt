All of my friends have (Blue eyes)
All of my friends got blue eyes
All of my friends got blue eyes
All of my friends got blue eyes
All of my friends got blue eyes
All of my friends got blue eyes
All of my friends got blue eyes
All of the rest, all the rest
No one left, no one left
All the rest are gone, they left
All the rest, no one left
All the rest is gone, they left
Everybody else is gone, they left
Everybody else is gone, they left
Everybody else, no one
(True friend)5Embed
