AAA Powerline Lyrics
Crushing rocks with Oyster Card
So nauseous, can't sleep it off
Backseat of some car
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
Crushing rocks with Oyster Card
So nauseous, can't sleep it off
Backseat of some car
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
Crushing rocks with Oyster Card
So nauseous, can't sleep it off
Backseat of some car
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
Crushing rocks with Oyster Card
So nauseous, can't sleep it off
Backseat of some car
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
Crushing rocks with Oyster Card
So nauseous, can't sleep it off
Backseat of some car
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
Crushing rocks with Oyster Card
So nauseous, can't sleep it off
Backseat of some car
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
Crushing rocks with Oyster Card
So nauseous, can't sleep it off
Backseat of some car
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
Crushing rocks with Oyster Card
So nauseous, can't sleep it off
Backseat of some car
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
(Will I ever be whole again?)
Zip-tied up, can't move my arms
(Will I ever be home again?)
No iris, black star and cross
(Will I ever be whole again?)
Skin so soft covered in g'Loss
(Will I ever be home again?)
Powerline, I hold the charge
