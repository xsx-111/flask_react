Sugar & Diesel Lyrics
(I'm not afraid of anything)
Who said this was supposed to be easy?
Silence, I hear my heart beating

You make it look so easy
Forbidden fruit, want to reach for it
Squeeze the juice out and bleed it
Break the skin up and peel it
I'm someone else around people
(Please, don't make me do something evil)
Lick my lips and eat it
We don't mix together, sugar and diesel

More, more, got to have it
No more, I can't handle it
No one gets to heaven
Uh-oh, that's embarrassing
Oops, no, something happened
Someone please call an ambulance
No more, got to have it
No more, I can't handle it

What's this feeling, what do I call it?
I can't stop thinking, I don't talk about it
Sometimes I don't look where I'm walking
God play tricks on me and I fall for it
Guess I'm sorry, it's my fault
I could have stopped whenever I wanted
Take what you want, I don't want this
A part of me became toxic
Got to get a grip, got to stop it
Got to breathe poisonous oxygen
I can't eat, but it's nothing
Can't go to sleep, but it's nothing
Always something, but it's nothing
Out of nowhere into nothing
I can't stop it, it's compulsive
Someone do something
I brought the bag out like it's nothing
Out of nowhere into nothing (New)
Don't tell anyone
Keep my mouth shut or I spill out my guts
Oh, pretty please with sugar on top
I can stop whenever I want
More, more, got to have it
No more, I can't handle it
No one gets to heaven
Uh-oh, that's embarrassing
Oops, no, something happened
Someone please call an ambulance
No more, got to have it
No more, I can't handle it

Can't have it
No more, can't handle it
No, no, can't have it
No more, can't handle it
No, no, can't have it
No more, I can't handle it
I'm not afraid of anything
(No more, I can't handle it)13Embed
