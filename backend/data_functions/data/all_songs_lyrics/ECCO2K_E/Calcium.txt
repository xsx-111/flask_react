Calcium Lyrics
Think I fell for someone, oh, what's going on?
I'm still covered in Dry g'LOSS and I can't take it off
Oh, and it's just me and myself, just the two of us
Spend some time alone with you now, you're my only one
I've got a thing for you, a thing for you?
I think of you, am I going crazy?
A thing for you, a thing for you
A thing (Don't take me back again, don't take me back again)

It's so hard to hide but so easy to find
(Lost my shine, I star and cross my eyes)
And my heart is blind, I star and cross my eyes
(Lost my shine, I star and cross my eyes)
Hydrogen peroxide, lime and ice
(Lost my shine, I star and cross my eyes)
Silver lights, I let it oxidize (Oxidize)

I've been rolling oxen bone
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Baby, kiss me through the phone
Ecco2k, I lost all hope
Smoking on dope, I feel so cold
Smoking on dope, I feel so cold
Live on islands made of stone
Rob that nigga for his coat
Twenty-five thousand on Silk Road
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, that glow
Obviously silver, not no gold
Tried to keep up and he went broke
Steaming hot, they don't want no smoke
2g K, went to the hole
And my heart is fine, I star and cross my eyes
Can never let you cross my mind
Oh, I try, it happens all the time (I'm not afraid of anything)
And my heart is blind, I star and cross my eyes
Can never let you cross my mind
Oh, I try, it happens all the time

Oh, I'm unraveling, and I’m panicking
Feel like I'm paper-thin, and now I’m tearing
Help me please, give me calcium, I think I'm fracturing
I need bandaging, don't take me back again
I feel like Marilyn, but I'm not acting again
This might be the end, I think it might be
I'm seeing evil men, am I imagining them?
I think I might be

I've been rolling oxen bone
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Baby, kiss me through the phone
Ecco2k, I lost all hope
Smoking on dope, I feel so cold
Smoking on dope, I feel so cold
Live on islands made of stone
Rob that nigga for his coat
Twenty-five thousand on Silk Road
Shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, that glow
Obviously silver, not no gold
Tried to keep up and he went broke
Steaming hot, they don't want no smoke
2g K, went to the hole
(Lost my shine, I star and cross my eyes)
Double K crystals kiss my nose
(Lost my shine, I star and cross my eyes)
Ecco2k, I lost all hope
(Lost my shine, I star and cross my eyes)
Live on islands made of stone
(Lost my shine, I star and cross my eyes)
Twenty-five thousand on Silk Road

Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
Double K crystals kiss my nose
I feel like I'm flying and sinking at the same time
Like I'm being pulled from below and from above (True friend)
