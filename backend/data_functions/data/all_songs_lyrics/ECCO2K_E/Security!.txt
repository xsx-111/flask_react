Security! Lyrics
I'm in my room, talk to the walls
I hear them sing, la-la-la-la
Falling backwards into the dark
I hear the voices talk so loud
Carry me softly, pull me down
I shut my eyes, cover my mouth
Tell me how
Something so beautiful can taste so foul
So foul
Something beautiful can taste so foul
Look around
Something beautiful can seem so
Worthless
Worthless
Worthless
Worthless
Security

So beautiful, so perfect
So beautiful, so perfect
So beautiful, so perfect
So beautiful, so perfect
Perfect
Security, perfect
How did you get so perfect?
I wish that I was perfect
You make me feel so dirty
You make me feel so naked
Ohh, I know it's worth it
I want to see you waste it
I want to be perfect
You make it look so perfect
Security, perfect
I know I'll never be perfect
One o'clock, 2 AM to 6 in the morning
One o'clock, 2 AM, I don't recognize myself
Now every time I close my eyes I see the corpses
Every time I look in the mirror I see monsters
One o'clock, 2 AM to 6 in the morning
I can’t hear my thoughts over this running water
Every time I look in the mirror I feel nauseous
Every time I look in the mirror I see monsters
What would you ask if you had one wish?
If you could choose only one thing to fix?
If you had the chance, would you change something?
You could lose yourself, would you take that risk?
What would you ask if you had one wish?
If you could choose only one thing to fix?
If you had the chance, would you change something?
Worthless
Security

So beautiful, so perfect
So beautiful, so perfect
So beautiful, so perfect
So beautiful, so perfect
Perfect
Security, perfect
How did you get so perfect?
I wish that I was perfect
You make me feel so dirty
You make me feel so naked
Oh, I know it's worth it
I want to see you waste it
I want to be perfect
You make it look so perfect
Security, perfect
I know I'll never be perfect6Embed
