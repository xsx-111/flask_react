Feel Lyrics
Woman, what are you doing?
You're driving me to ruin
The love that you've been stealing
Has given me a feeling

I feel like I'm dying
I'm never gonna live again
You just ain't been trying
It's getting very near the end

I feel like I'm dying
I'm never gonna live again
You just ain't been trying
It's getting very near the end

Woman, what are you doing?
You're driving me to ruin
The love that you've been stealing
Has given me a feeling

I feel like I'm dying
I'm never gonna live again
You just ain't been trying
It's getting very near the end
I feel like I'm dying
I feel like I'm dying1Embed
