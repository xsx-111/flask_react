Try Again LyricsLord, I've been trying to be what I should
Lord, I've been trying to do what I could
But each time it gets a little harder
I feel the pain
But I'll try again
Lord, I've been trying to be understood
And lord, I've been trying to do as you would
But each time it gets a little harder
I feel the pain
But I'll try again1Embed
