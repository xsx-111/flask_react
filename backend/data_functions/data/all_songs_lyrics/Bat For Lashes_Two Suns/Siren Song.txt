Siren Song Lyrics
Are you my family?
Can I stay with you a while?
Can I stop off in your bed tonight?
I can make you smile

In the morning I'll make you breakfast
In the evening I'll warm the bed
And I'll always be happy to kiss you
Promise I'll never get sad

'Til the siren come calling, calling
It's driving me evil, evil
Momma was a heartbreaker
Loved you the same way I do
But I've got so much wickedness and sin

My name is Pearl
And I love you the best way I know how
My blonde curls slice through your heart
When the sirens come calling
It won't be long
Until you're running
Help you dress yourself up fancy
And bathe you when you get sore
I'll be good, I think I could
Be all you would want and more and more

Be proud when you dazzle the wanderers
Glitter your eyes for the town
Tell every last boy that you're my man
I'll try not to let you down

'Til the siren come calling, calling
It's driving me evil, evil
Momma was a heartbreaker
Loved you the same way I do
But I've got so much wickedness and sin

My name is Pearl
And I love you the best way I know how
My blonde curls slice through your heart
When the stars are exploding in your eyes
It won't be long until you're running
No, it won't be long 'til you're running
It won't be long until you're running
It won't be long until you're running
Cause I'm evil, evil...2Embed
