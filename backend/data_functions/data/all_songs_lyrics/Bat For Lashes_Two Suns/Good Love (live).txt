Good Love (live) LyricsIn the night time we are found
Misty sorrow swoop unbound
Whisper you mean it, say you'll stay
Hold my heart till brighter days
Now I am searching how to get alone
This queen of heart's dancing on her throne
But I need sorrow, baby, life's sorrow is the drug
So will I ever find that place they call good love?
Good love
Passed it last night in a dream
Good love
And my heart caught fire
I drove past true love once, in a dream
Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed
Then the magician disappeared as quickly as he came
And with a sound like white magic caught in a black car's blazing trail
The house set fire to my heart
Like an inferno we shone rays
I swallowed the sun in your form
I woke up and you were crying
I woke up and you were saying
Good love
Passed it last night in a dream
Good love
Cause my heart caught fire
Good love
Passed it last night in a dream
Good love
Cause my heart caught fireEmbed
