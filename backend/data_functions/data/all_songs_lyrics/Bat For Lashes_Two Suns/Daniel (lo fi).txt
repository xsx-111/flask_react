Daniel (lo fi) LyricsDaniel, when I first saw you
I knew that you had a flame in your heart
And under wild blue sky
Marble movie sky
I found a home in your eyes
We would never be apart
And when the fires came
The smell of cinders and rain
Perfumed almost everything
We laughed and laughed and laughed
And in the golden blue
Car you took me to
The darkest place you knew
And you set fire to my heart
When I run in the dark
(Daniel)
Into a place that’s lost
(Daniel)
Under a sheet of rain in my heart
(Daniel)
I dream of home…
But in the goodbye bed
With my arms around your neck
Into our mouths the tears crept
Just kids in the eye of the storm
And as my house spun round
My dreams pulled me from the ground
Forever to search for the flame
For home again
For home again
When I run in the dark
(Daniel)
Into a place that’s lost
(Daniel)
Under a sheet of rain in my heart
(Daniel)
I dream of home…
When I run in the dark
(Daniel)
Into a place that’s lost
(Daniel)
Under a sheet of rain in my heart
(Daniel)
I dream of home…Embed
