Glass Lyrics
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth

Went over the sea
What did I find?
A thousand crystal towers
A hundred emerald cities
And the hand of the watchman
In the night sky
Points to my beloved
A knight in crystal armour…

And I tried to hold him
I tried for the cream
I’ll make a suit of colours
To stop the blinding mirrors
Sew a cape of rainbow
Stifle up the beam
With the perfect armour
With the perfect dream…

To be made of glass!
When two suns are shining
The battle becomes blinding
To be made of glass!
But we’re light and light and light
And light and light!
And from two suns spinning
At two different speeds
Was born a hot white diamond
Burning through the rainbow
Flames fell into orbit
To hold eternally
Two heavenly spirits
That just wouldn’t see

To be made of glass!
When two suns are shining
The battle becomes blinding
To be made of glass!
But we’re light and light and light
And light and light!

Hey, oh
Hey, oh oh oh
Hey, oh
Hey, oh oh oh
Hey, oh
Hey oh oh ohEmbed
