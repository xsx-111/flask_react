The Big Sleep Lyrics
How can it be the last show? (how can it be?)
How can it be the last show? (how can it be?)

No more spotlights coming down from heaven
It's a goodbye, it's curtains down time
Not even out of my dress
And already my voice is fading
Goodbye, my dears (goodbye)
And into the big sleep1Embed
