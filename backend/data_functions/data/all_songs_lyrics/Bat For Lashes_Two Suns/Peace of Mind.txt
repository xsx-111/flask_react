Peace of Mind Lyrics
Look at this and look at us
We wonder, oh, we’re wandering
And I don't like to say we're lost (say we're lost)
Try my best with leading us (with leading us)

Build a ladder to the sky (to the sky)
Sit up there and say 'Oh my!' (say 'Oh my!')
Does looking down make me a Queen? (make me a Queen)
With all the sorrow that I’ve seen (that I’ve seen)

And if I ever get back down…
Find a map that takes me back
Through the wounded, through the wars
To a time that came before

To hover-board into the sun
And bring back when my time is done
A mother for this childless world
And an arrow of light for every boy and girl

And peace of mind
Peace of mind
Peace of mind (peace of mind, oh, peace of mind)
Peace of mind (peace of mind, oh, peace of mind)
Peace of mind (peace of mind, oh, peace of mind)
Peace of mind (peace of mind, oh, peace of mind)
Oh, piece of mindEmbed
