Travelling Woman Lyrics
Hang on travelling woman
Don’t sacrifice your plan
Cause it will come back to you
Before you lose it on the man
Never fall in love with potential
Cause you can see with your own eyes
All the pretty faces and sorry words
Can take away your pride

Got to listen to the vision
Some may say a dream, words from the unseen
Or it can make you tired, tell you lies and make you fall
Make you tired, tell you lies, make you fall
Make you tired, tell you lies, make you fall

Hang on travelling woman
Don’t sacrifice your plan
Cause it will come back to you
Before you lose it on the man

Got to listen to the vision
Play in the ashes of what you once were
Got to listen to the vision
Play in the ashes of what you once wereEmbed
