Two Planets Lyrics(We are strangers in a strange land
Wanderers in a vast and unknowable universe)
Show me moonlight on the sunrise
I've seen so many planets dancing
I've seen too many people hiding
Show me sunset and I won't forget
That I am one of two planets dancing
I am one of two planets dancing
Shallow man!
Sign your name
On my sun!
The song of Solomon
Died in the battleground
The song of Solomon
Died in love's battleground
I am full
Shattered by this sinning time
For all your suffering by night
Oh warm, but under bright
And life is so much dark and light
Day cannot exist without a night
And you are not separate from me
I am a heart that's full of life
And to be shared
On this night
Feel my hands
Feel my life
For the Sun
And the stars
Are my Mother
And my sister
I know where the form is changing
I know that the stars will follow me...Embed
