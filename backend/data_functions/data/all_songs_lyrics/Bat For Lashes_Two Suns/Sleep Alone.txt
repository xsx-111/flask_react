Sleep Alone Lyrics
You know, my darling, I can't stand to sleep alone
No sweetheart in the dark to call my own
You're my own, you're my own, I can sing it, I can groan
But the darkness is a stranger and I'm lonely, lonely, lonely, low...

Last night's parties and last night's horrorshow
Smiling and whirling and kissing all I know
Give my soul, give my soul, sing it free across the sea
A lonely spell to conjure you, but conjure hell is all I do

Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mama told me
The dream of love is a two hearted dream
Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mama told me
The dream of love is a two hearted dream

They say for every high, high there must be a low, low, low, low, low
From every sun ascending a lonesome moon will grow, grow, grow, grow
Drive my heart, drive my heart, into the fire of a burning heart's desire
A lonely spell so you be seen, do you hear me coming in my blue dream?

Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mama told me
The dream of love is a two hearted dream
Lonely, lonely, lonely, 'cause my mama told me
The dream of love is a two hearted dream
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely, lonelyEmbed
