Daniel Lyrics
Daniel, when I first saw you
I knew that you had a flame in your heart
And under wild blue skies
Marble movie skies
I found a home in your eyes
And we'd never be apart

And when the fires came
The smell of cinders and rain
Perfumed almost everything
We laughed and laughed and laughed

And in the golden-blue
Car you took me to
The darkest place you knew
And set fire to my heart

When I run in the dark, Daniel
Into a place that's lost, Daniel
Under a sheet of rain in my heart, Daniel
I dream of home
But in a goodbye bed
With my arms around your neck
Into our mouths the tears crept
Just kids in the eye of the storm

And as the house spun round
My dreams pulled me from the ground
Forever to search for the flame
For home again!
For home again!

When I run in the dark, Daniel
Into a place that's lost, Daniel
Under a sheet of rain in my heart, Daniel
I dream of home
When I run in the dark, Daniel
Into a place that's lost, Daniel
Under a sheet of rain in my heart, Daniel
I dream of home6Embed
