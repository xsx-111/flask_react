Moon and Moon Lyrics
Lover, when you don't lay with me
I'm a huntress for a husband lost at sea
If I had you here, braid our hair together
I'd be boy and you'd be girl, beautiful

Calling moon and moon
Shoot that big, bad hand
It'll track me to your door
And I won't see you no more

When this wild world (wild world)
Is a big bad hand (big bad hand)
Pushing on my back (my back)
Do you understand? (understand)

When I get home (get home)
Been in the jungle (jungle)
Where's my bear to lick me clean? (lick me)
Feed my soul milk and honey

Calling moon and moon (shoot that, shoot that, shoot that)
Shoot that big, bad hand (shoot that, shoot that, shoot that)
It'll track me to your door (shoot that, shoot that, shoot that)
And I won't see you no more (shoot that, shoot that, shoot that)
I won't see you no moreEmbed
