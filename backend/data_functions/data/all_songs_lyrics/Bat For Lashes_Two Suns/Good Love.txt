Good Love Lyrics
In the nighttime we are found
Misty sorrow swoop unbound
Whisper you mean it, say you'll stay
Hold my heart till brighter days

Now I am searching and I'll do it alone
This Queen of Hearts dancing on her throne
But I need sorrow, baby, like sorrow is the drug
So will I ever find that place they call 'Good Love'?

Good love
Past it last night in a dream
Good love
And my heart caught fire

I drove past true love once, in a dream
Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed
And the magician disappeared as quickly as he came
And with a sound like white magic caught in a black car's blazing trail

The house set fire to my heart
Like an inferno we shone and raged
I'd swallowed the sun in your form
I woke up and you were crying
I woke up and you were saying
Good love
Past it last night in a dream
Was that 'Good Love'?
Cause my heart caught fire (went up in flames)
Good love
Past it last night in a dream
Was that 'Good Love'?
Cause my heart caught fire (went up in flames)Embed
