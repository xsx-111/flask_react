Lonely (live) LyricsLonely, lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place, lonely
Lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
I thought that I knew
All that there was to
Lonely, lonely, lonely
Melanie Jane
Won't feel the pain
Lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
I thought that I knew
All that there was to
Lonely, lonely
Lonely eyes, lonely face
Lonely, lonely in your place
And I still love you
I still love you
Lonely, lonelyEmbed
