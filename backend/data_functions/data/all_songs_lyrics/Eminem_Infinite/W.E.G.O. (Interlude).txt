W.E.G.O. (Interlude) Lyrics
Yeah, Soul Intent, checking in
Number one, baby this week
You know what I'm sayin'?
This is M.C. Proof

And DJ Head!

Checkin' in on W.E.G.O
You know what I'm sayin'?
Ayy, yo, we got the number one
Requested song, of the day
Coming up next
It's a local 313 talent
He goes by the name of Eminem
And it's called, It's O.K4Embed
