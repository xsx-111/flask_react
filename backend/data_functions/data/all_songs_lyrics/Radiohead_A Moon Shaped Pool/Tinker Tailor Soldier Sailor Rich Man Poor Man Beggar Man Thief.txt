Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief Lyrics
All the holes at once
Are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey

The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

All the birds stay up
In the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here
Come to me
Before it's too late

The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes21Embed
