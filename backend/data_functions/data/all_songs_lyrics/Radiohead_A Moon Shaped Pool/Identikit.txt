A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me
A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes won't let me in
And now I know it's never gonna be, oh, me

The sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love, that we all can love, that we all

But now I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know

Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create, that we can
Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create, that we can create

But when I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know, I don’t want to know34Embed
