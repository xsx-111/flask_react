Do You Remember When LyricsI overheard someone mention your name
I overheard now my heart feels the pain
I though that I would get over you with time
But here you are again you're back in my mind
Time moves slowly since you've gone
Away (Tick-tock Tick-tock)
Life moves slowly since you've gone
Away (Tick-tock Tick-tock)

Do you - Do you remember when
Our hearts - Our hearts were together then
You're gone - We're out on our own again
My love - Do you remember when
I walk the room where we both used to sit
I walk the room and I refuse to admit
That I'm all alone and our love's been left behind
And now, once again, you are back in my mind
Life's so empty since you've gone
Away (Tick-tock Tick-tock)
I'm so empty since you've gone
Away (Tick-tock Tick-tock)

You're gone
You're gone
You're goneEmbed
