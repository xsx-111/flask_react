Flamethrower LyricsAll day long she holds it back
Back with all her might
She carries a burnin' torch inside
She holds it firm and tight
She punches out the clock
While it keeps punchin' out her life
She's a flamethrower, red-hot glower
Flamethrower at night
The things she wears to work
They hang off her kinda loose
Her blouse don't fit, the pants ain't right
She ain't no front page news
But when her work is done
And the daytime turns to night
The headlines flash in neon
That the girl has taken flight
Chairman of the board
Won't look her in the eye
The fire of her vision
His money just can't buy
Silently she waits
Silently she contemplates
She can make 'em tremble
You know the reason why
She's a flame - flamethrower
She's a flamethrower at night
She's a flame - a red-hot glower
She's a flamethrower at night
You might think you're burnin'
All your candles at both ends
Maybe you should go to church
To make up some amends
But if you think you're fireproof
So cool and much too much
Don't dare go near my baby
'Cause she'll melt you with her touch
I forget the darkness
I forget the pain
When she's movin' through my heart
And when she's pumpin' through my veins
She's the part inside me
I never can control
And she's the only reason
I know I've got a soul
