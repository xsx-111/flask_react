My Children LyricsTo create, pass on, pass on
What's mine, now yours, pass on
Written in stone, no longer in sand, pass on
Pass on, to create
To grace, what's mine, now yours, I'm gone, pass on
To create, create, pass on, pass on
What's mine, now yours, I'm gone, pass on, create, create
In stone
Not sand, pass on, I'm gone, to grace
Pass on, in stone, pass on
All mine for yours, pass on
To give all, give all, pass on
Next mine, now gone, pass on
To grace, pass on
To grace, pass on
Give all, give all, give all, give all to
To my children
Ain't got no mother
Came from my temple, all, when I thought them
And my children
I never loved them
Why feel that way when their existence is my business?
And my children
They never listen
Vaped in the brain, feral vessals of my self-interest
My children
They are the future
Good luck with the mess I left, you innovators
My children
Pay dividends
Vomit and rage spewing forth in the drive-thru
So don't lean on me, man 'cause I ain't got nothing to give
A-don't lean on me, man 'cause I ain't got nothing to give
A-don't lean on me, man 'cause I ain't got nothing to give
A-don't lean on me, man 'cause I ain't got nothing to give
To my children
Oh, my children – they’re right behind you
Oh, my children – they’re gonna beat you
Oh, my children – if you let them
Oh, oh, my children2Embed
