Male Plague Lyrics
I said it three times, guess I'll say it four
I'm sad and sick to watch you devolve 
Your pen has gone gray 
The view has been walled 
And no one knows what you're saying at all

See-through skin - barnacles of age 
Male plague, male plague
Old days misremembering
Male plague, male plague
You think the world gives you a stroke 
Male plague, male plague
Fear of the future of losing your hold
Male plague, male plague 

Hey figurehead, what you gonna do?
Her truth moves too fast for you
Hurled upon the stage 
The act has gone sour 
Sad sacks pickled in jars

See-through skin - barnacles of age
Male plague, male plague
False news beamed right in 
Male plague, male plague
Every boy wants to be a cop
Male plague, male plague
Punching down - you punch them out
Male plague, male plague 
Everybody knows it's gonna kill you some day 
Everybody knows it's gonna kill you some day 
Everybody knows it's gonna kill you some day 
Everybody knows it, tastes it, feels it 
Everybody knows it's gonna kill you some day 
Everybody knows it, needs it, wants it
Everybody knows it's gonna kill you some dayEmbed
