Night-Blooming Cereus Lyrics
In the far desert 
On a distant blasted plain 
A forgotten corner
Amid the death of all things 
Not under the blinding sun or the cultivator's toil

Only in darkness does the flower take hold
It blooms at night, it blooms at night

In the old city, in abandoned shells
On a desolated edge 
Amid the death of all things 
Not under the scornful eye or the corporation's hand 

Only in darkness does the flower take hold 
It blooms at night, it blooms at night

In my own head
Near the hole where hope drains out
And fear is branded deep 
Amid the death of all things 
Not under law or the thoughts I had before
Only in darkness does the flower take hold 
It blooms at night, it blooms at night 

In a valley filled with flowers unseen in the dark
In a valley filled with flowers unseen in the dark
It blooms at night 
It blooms at night 
It blooms at nightEmbed
