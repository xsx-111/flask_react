Here Is the Thing LyricsDread 2017 18
Air horn age
Age of horn blowing
Mental corkscrew
Starwipe to gloom
Pulling cork, snoring out all day
Woke up in the stadium district 
Here is the thing, here is the thing
Hey, well now later the hour
Now you know innovative thievery in parking structures
Landing least of the horrors
Least of the horrors
At least they are well lit, well
Here is the thing, here is the thing
Old billionaire dead, buried in his hair shirt
New face loves surveillance, comic sans, parroting an ape
Here is the thing, here is the thing
From foot to gut - come on stone - quicken stone- pass through- pass without pain- take everything- reach rock roll- reach rock roll- pass through silent- put shiny bezoars fresh in the pot- for sales- from an old goat- and the gut
Here is the thing, here is the thing
And it will be with you for the rest of your life
It lives in your home 
Under roof and floor, every room
In the ground 
In the day
In the grind of the day
It grows fat off your fear
And it will be with you for all your life
Here is the thing, here is the thing, there is the thing
It makes you choose between necessity and health 
Anything can do what you do
It drops like dung both poverty and wealth
Here is the thing, giggling and gagging
False test 
Time to pull the profits from their chest 
Here is the thing, here is the thing 
(unintelligible ranting)Embed
