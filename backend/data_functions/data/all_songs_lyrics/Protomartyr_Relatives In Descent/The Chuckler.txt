The Chuckler Lyrics
It meant a lot to me then
It matters less to me now
And any pleasure derived 
Was knowing that they'd never feel as good
As a badge pinned on a thrift store coat
That smelled of sauerkraut and cloves

An angry customer's face 
Confused because they didn't get their way
Is something they would never allow
But they have to allow
Because this pitiful exchange
Will be the sole high point of our day

I guess I'll keep on chuckling
'Til there's no more breath in my lungs
And it really doesn't matter at all
Ha ha

War and rumors of war
Clouds of poison in the sky
And poison in the soil
Oh Lord, how I wish there was a better ending to this joke
It meant a lot to me then
It matters less to me now
All calls are answered
It's no bother, I just wanted to talk 
To the direct marketer
From Bangalore or was it Mahabalipuram?

He tried to sell me on a credit card
I asked about the weather and whether his life was hard
You say your name is Lazlo?
I don't think that is true
Because Yar, I know a Lazlo
And he doesn't sound half as smart as you

I guess I'll keep on chuckling
'Til there's no more breath in my lungs
And it really doesn't matter at all
Ha ha

War and rumors of war
Clouds of poison in the sky
And poison in the soil
Lord, how I wish there was a better ending to this joke
War and rumors of war
Clouds of poison in the sky
And poison in the soil
Lord, how I wish there was a better ending to this joke1Embed
