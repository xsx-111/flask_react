Caitriona LyricsThey bathed me
They clothed me 
Not in the dress I loved
All those years ago
They dropped me 
In the cheap plot 
To save a couple dimes
Seems like such a crime
And all that loving, that's leaving
Replaced now with complaining down in this hole 
And I'll be spitting on the living
'Til I get my cross of Connemara stone
To save money  for his plain wife
My stupid son never grasped the finer points of life
My guts burst 
But my mind stays sharp 
In this cold clay
The cemetery dust 
And all that loving, that's leaving
Replaced now with complaining down in this hole 
And I'll be spitting on the living
'Til I get my cross of Connemara stone
They'll keep talking and talking eternally
Fussing and fighting eternally
Cursing and crying eternally 
Bawling, back-biting eternally1Embed
