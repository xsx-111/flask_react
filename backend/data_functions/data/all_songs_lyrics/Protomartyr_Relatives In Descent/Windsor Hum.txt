Windsor Hum Lyrics
The sound that you're hearing across the river
Saying "everything's fine"
The sound across the river into your brain pan
Saying "everything's fine"
The sound going across the ocean
Saying "everything's fine"

It says want, want, want, want, want what you are given
Need need need need need what you'll never have 
It says want, want, want, want, want what you are given
Need need need need need what you'll never have 
Never have, and never will, never will

The old Windsor humming
Across the river
From the U.S. of A
Saying, "everything's fine"

It says want, want, want, want, want what you are given
Need, need, need, need, need what you'll never have 
Never have, and never will
The Windsor hum
The Windsor humming
The winds are hummingEmbed
