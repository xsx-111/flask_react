Corpses in Regalia Lyrics
From a high window
I spied a pale brown thing
Though it was very far away
I heard its voice inside my head:
"You've been spending your time
With corpses in regalia 
You better get to stepping while you can" 

They have a certain charm
The way they move
The way they mouth the words
Drinking Balthazars

Decent people don't live like that
Decent folk don't live that good

Fools on the beach
The sand is little bones 
Watch where you go
Watch where you go 
Watch where you go
They know how to slow time
The way they gloam 
The way they promote the brand 
Drinking Nebuchadnezzers 

Decent people don't live like that 
Decent folk don't live that good 

Oh, you fools
There's teeth in the surf 
Watch where you go 
Watch where you go 
Watch where you go
Watch where you go

From a high window
I spied a pale brown thing
Though it was very far away
I heard its voice inside my head:
"You've been spending your time
With corpses in regalia 
Better get to stepping while you can"Embed
