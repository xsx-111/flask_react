Up the Tower Lyrics
I gave him a cigarette
So he opened up his head
The man forever on the corner
He called it his pre-vision:Â 
Unhorse for me, dear sir
The marble emperor
Defenestrate the king

The howling waves of people
Crashing through the first blockade
The guards - they washed away
They thundered up the stairwell
Until they reached that golden door
They knocked upon the golden door

Knock it down Knock it down
Knock it down Knock it down
Knock it down Knock it down
Knock it down Knock it down
Knock it down Knock it down
Knock it down Knock it down
Knock it down Knock it down
Knock it down Knock it down
The portraits in the hallway
Look better smashed upon the floor
Gaudy baubles - turned to dust
The hatred he brewed within us
Is now crashing loud upon his shore
The vultures returned to roost

What a lovely view
Horizon looks like fire
Open up the window
Let the light in

Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
Throw him out Throw him out Throw him out
What a lovely view
From the window
What a lovely dreamEmbed
