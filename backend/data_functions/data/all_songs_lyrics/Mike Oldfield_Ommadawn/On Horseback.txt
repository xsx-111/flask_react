On Horseback LyricsI like beer, and I like cheese
I like the smell of a westerly breeze
But what I like more than all of these
Is to be on horseback
:
Hey and away we go
Through the grass, across the snow
Big brown beastie, big brown face
I'd rather be with you than flying through space
I like thunder, and I like rain
And open fires, and roaring flames
But if the thunder's in my brain
I'd like to be on horseback
Some like the city, some the noise
Some make chaos, and others, toys
But if I was to have the choice
I'd rather be on horseback

Some find it strange to be here
On this small planet, and who knows where
But when it's strange and full of fear
It's nice to be on horseback
Some are short, and others tall
Some hit their heads against the wall
But it doesn't really matter at all
When you happen to be on horseback

So if you feel a little glum
To Hergest Ridge you should come
In summer, winter, rain or sun
It's good to be on horseback


You know, I'd rather be on horseback1Embed
