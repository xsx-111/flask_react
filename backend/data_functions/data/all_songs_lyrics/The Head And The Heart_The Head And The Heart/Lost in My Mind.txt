Lost in My Mind Lyrics
Put your dreams away for now
I won't see you for some time
I am lost in my mind
I get lost in my mind
Momma once told me
"You're already home where you feel loved,"
I am lost in my mind
I get lost in my mind

Oh my brother
Your wisdom is older than me
Oh my brother
Don’t you worry ‘bout me
Don’t you worry
Don’t you worry
Don’t worry about me

How’s that bricklaying coming?
How’s your engine running?
Is that bridge getting built?
Are your hands getting filled?
Won’t you tell me, my brother?
'Cause there are stars up above
We can start moving forward
How’s that bricklaying coming?
How’s your engine running?
Is that bridge getting built?
Are your hands getting filled?
Won’t you tell me, my brother?
'Cause there are stars up above
We can start moving forward
Lost in my mind
Lost in my mind
Oh I get lost in my mind
Lost, I get lost, I get lost in my mind
Lost in my mind
Yes I get lost in my mind
Lost, I get lost, I get lost
Oh I get lost
Oh I get2Embed
