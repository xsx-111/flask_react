Honey Come Home Lyrics
Honey, come home
My stubborn ways are behind me now
They're behind me now

And there's nothing here
That will not break down
Like you never did

The kids say hello
To us in our separate homes

Darlin' please come home
I've cleaned out the fridge
Wiped the counters off
And put away my clothes

Do you remember every block
Every minute of every walk we used to take
We were young, so many years ago

And I think of all this time
That we've wasted with all our fighting
And I cry
Just wanna die with the one I love
Beside me
"Someday," you said
Someday you will miss my head
Lyin' next to yours
In our marriage bed

Do you remember every block
Every minute of every walk we used to take
We were young, so many years ago

Oh God, I love my vices
But they've taken me to places
That I never thought I'd go
And I am ready to be home

And I think of every spark
Every whisper in the dark
Now it's time
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love
Beside me
Honey, come home
My stubborn ways are behind me now2Embed
