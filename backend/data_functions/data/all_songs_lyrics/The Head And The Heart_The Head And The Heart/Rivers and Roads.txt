Rivers and Roads Lyrics
A year from now we'll all be gone
All our friends will move away
And they're goin' to better places
But our friends will be gone away
Nothin' is as it has been
And I miss your face like hell
And I guess it's just as well
But I miss your face like hell

Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh
Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh

Been talkin' 'bout the way things change
And my family lives in a different state
If you don't know what to make of this
Then we will not relate
So if you don't know what to make of this
Then we will not relate

Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh
Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh
Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh
Ohhh uh oh uhhhh oh

Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you
Rivers and roads
Oh rivers and roads
Oh rivers 'til I reach you
Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you
Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you
Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you
Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you

Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you
Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you
Rivers and roads
Rivers and roads
Rivers 'til I reach you30Embed
