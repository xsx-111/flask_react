Cats and Dogs Lyrics
Somewhere underneath the floorboard, I will sweep my garden
Underneath the cupboard lives a mouse and he discovered
There was nothing there, nothing there
To discover

Falling from the sky, there are raindrops in my eyes
And my thoughts are diggin' in the backyard
My roots have grown but I don't know where they are
Don't know where they are, don't know where they are
My roots have grown but I don't know where they are

Cats and dogs and rooster calls
Telephones and pay phone stalls

They take away the lonely days
For now
They take away the lonely days
For nowEmbed
