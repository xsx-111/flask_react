Sounds Like Hallelujah Lyrics(One, two, one two three four)
I'm just waitin' on the sun
To close his eyes and call it a night
So we can put all our differences aside
I'm just waitin' on the moon
With all the stars and all its gloom
We can watch it fall right back in to place
So I won't keep myself around
Just to keep you warm
Woo-oo-oo-oo
Woo-oo-oo-oo
Ooh-oo-oo
Woo-oo-oo-oo
Woo-oo-oo ooh-oo-oo
Momma don't put no gun in my hand
I don't wanna end up like these men
Momma don't put no gun in my hand
I don't wanna end up like these men
I'm not walkin' away
I'm just hearin' what you're sayin'
For the first time
Sounds like hallelujah for the first time
For the first time
Singing like hallelujah for the first time
And I'll miss you someday
I'll miss you someday
I'll miss you someday
I'll miss you someday
I'll miss you someday
I'll miss you
I'm not walkin' away
I'm just hearin' what you're sayin'
For the first time
Sounds like hallelujah for the first time
For the first time
Singin' hallelujah for the first timeEmbed
