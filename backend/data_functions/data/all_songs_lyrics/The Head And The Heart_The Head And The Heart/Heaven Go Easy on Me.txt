Heaven Go Easy on Me LyricsGod, what are we doin'?
Can't live this way forever
Gotta make ourselves some money
Or be thrown out with the bathwater
My sister and my brother
Look to me for answers
And our fathers and our mothers
Wanna know they raised us right
Wanna know they raised us right
Is it that the good life is the simple one
(Sittin' in the lawn watchin' leaves go by)
Readin' good books and playin' songs
Watchin' the wind blow through your front yard
Don't follow your head
Follow your heart
And while you're sittin' all alone in your room on your bed
And your windows are open but you won't go out, no
Ah, heaven go easy on me
And while you're sittin' all alone in your room on your bed
And your windows are open but you won't go out, no
Ah, heaven go easy on me
It's damn good to've met you, I hope that you stay
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
We're well on our way
(All these things are rushing by)
(All these things are rushing by)
(All these things are rushing by)
(All these things are rushing by)
(All these things are rushing by)
(continued in background)
All things must end, darlin'
All things must end, darlin'
All things must end, darlin'
All things must end, darlin'
(All these things are rushing by)
(All these things are rushing by)
Ah, heaven go easy on meEmbed
