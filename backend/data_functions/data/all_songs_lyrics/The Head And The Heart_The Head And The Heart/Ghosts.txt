Ghosts LyricsBoys in the street are talking about leaving, they're leaving
Looking for places to go
Boys in the street are talking about leaving, they're leaving
Looking for places to go
Andy built his coffin down in Carolina
Told me he was running from something
But I think he's just out chasing girls
When Mary moved all of her shit to Chicago
Her mother made sure that she left with her Bible
But you won't find her face on Sundays

All my friends are talking about leaving, about leaving
But all my friends are sitting in their graves
All my friends are talking about leaving, about leaving
But all my friends are sitting in their graves
Is it any wonder why we all leave home?
People say, "I knew you when you were six years old"
And you say, "But I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed."
Mom and Dad, if only you could see me now
Been here for a year and now I own this town
Cause I've changed, I've changed, I've changed, I've changed
All my friends are talking about leaving, about leaving
But all my friends are sitting in their graves
All my friends are talking about leaving, about leaving
But all my friends are sitting in their graves
One day we'll all be ghosts
Tripping around in someone else's home
One day we'll all be ghosts, ghosts, ghosts
Ghosts, ghosts, ghosts
One day we'll all be found
No longer lost, we're just hanging around
One day we'll all be found, found, found
Found, found, found3Embed
