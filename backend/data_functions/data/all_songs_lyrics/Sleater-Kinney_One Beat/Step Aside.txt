Step Aside LyricsWill you come knocking on my door?
Pull me pick me off the floor
I might need something to get me going
Feel it one time IT ROLLS dig it
When I feel worn out when I feel beaten
Like a used up shoe or a cake half-eaten
There's only one way to keep on feeling
Move it up one time IN TIME
This mama works till her back is sore
But the baby's fed and the tunes are pure
So you'd better get your feet on the floor
Move it up one time TO THE BEAT, TO THE BEAT, TO THE BEAT, TO THE BEAT
These times are troubled these times are rough
There's more to come but you can't give up
Why don't you shake a tail for peace and love
Move it up one time FOR LOVE
JANET CARRIE CAN YOU FEEL IT
(Knife through the heart of our exploitation)
LADIES ONE TIME CAN YOU HEAR IT
(Disassemble your discrimination)
When violence rules the world outside
And the headlines make me want to cry
It's not the time to just keep quiet
Speak up one time TO THE BEAT, TO THE BEAT, TO THE BEAT, TO THE BEATEmbed
