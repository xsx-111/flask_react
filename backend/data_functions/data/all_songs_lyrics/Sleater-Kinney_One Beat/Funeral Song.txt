Funeral Song LyricsStay away from the haunted heart
Stay away from the haunted heart
You swore to yourself that you'd make a new start
Just like the demon with the poison dart
There's nothing left to see
Turn out the light
There's nothing left to see
Turn out the light
Stay away from the burning house
Stay away from the burning house
To get inside, you'll never get out
Die together before the flames go out
Burn your baby make you scream and shout?
Burn your baby make you scream and shout?
Build it up just to tear it down
Nothing left but ashes of doubt
There's nothing left to see
Turn out the light
There's nothing left to see
Turn out the light
Put it in the ground sing a funeral song
Put it in the ground sing a funeral song
Have the neighbors over and we'll sing along
Lowering the coffin on a love gone wrong
Hey there now what did you bury today?
Hey there now what did you bury today?
Buried the love that I hoped would stay
Nothing says 'forever' like my very own grave
There's nothing left to see
Turn out the light
There's nothing left to see
Turn out the light
There's nothing left of me
Turn out the light
No one here but me
Turn out the lightEmbed
