Hollywood Ending LyricsYou stay on 'til you're good and raw
Go back and forth, a little see-saw
Hoping that this ride will end
But when it does you go again
Can't get that monster
Out of my mind
She's got my hair and
She's got my eyes
She follows me wherever I go
Speaking for me and
Wearing my clothes
You hang on 'til your hands are sore
Blistering you still want more
You think there's something here for you
Go out and buy yourself a clue
Can't get that monster
Out of my mind
She's got my hair and
She's got my eyes
She follows me wherever I go
Speaking for me and
Wearing my clothes
In Hollywood where all the lights are low
And truth's as rare as the winter snow
She wanted a place arid as her soul
Where her only job was never to grow old
When the lights are shining
Will you see my skin
Or just the shell that
I'm packaged in
I've held my tongue
And I've hid my sores
If I'm less of myself
Will you love me moreEmbed
