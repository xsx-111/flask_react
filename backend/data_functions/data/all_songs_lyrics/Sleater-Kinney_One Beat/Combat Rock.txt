Combat Rock LyricsThey tell us there are only two sides to be on
If you are on our side, you’re right, if not you’re wrong
But are we innocent, the paragons of good?
Is our guilt erased by the pain that we’ve endured, endured?
Hey, look, it's time to pledge allegiance
I love my dirty Uncle Sam
Our country's marching to the beat now
And we must learn to step in time
Where is the questioning? Where is the protest song?
Since when is skepticism un-American?
Dissent’s not treason, but they talk like it’s the same
Those who disagree are afraid to show their face, their face
Let's break out our old machines now
It sure is good to see them run again
Oh, gentlemen, start your engines
And we know where we get the oil from
Are you feeling all right now?
(Is this why we unite?)
Paint myself red, white, blue
(There are reasons to unite)
Are you singing let's fight now?
(If you hate this time)
Innocent people die, uh oh
(Remember, we are the time)
Show you love your country, go out and spend some cash
Red, white, blue hot pants, doing it for Uncle Sam
Now flex our muscles, show them we’re stronger than the rest
Raise your hands up, baby, are you sure that we’re the best, the best?
We'll come out with our fists raised
The good, old boys are back on top again
And if we let them lead us blindly
Past becomes the future once again
Are you feeling all right now?
(There are reasons to unite)
Paint myself red, white, blue
(Is this why we unite?)
Are you singing let's fight now?
(If you hate this time)
Innocent people die, uh oh
(Remember, we're the time)
Are you feeling all right now?
(There are reasons to unite)
Innocent people die, uh oh
(Is this why we unite?)
No one's ever 
(If you hate this time)
No one's ever 
(Remember, we are the time)Embed
