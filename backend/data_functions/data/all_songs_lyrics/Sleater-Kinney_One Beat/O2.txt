O2 LyricsI wanna run away
I wanna get away
But I will never get up
Oh won't you help me up
I rely on oxygen
I depend on the bitter snow
I rely on oxygen
I depend on the bitter cold
I want to know
Why it hurts to stay
And hurts to go away
Will I be ok?
Crawled out of the mud
This filth you called your love
Slept for countless days
But I will be ok
I wanna run away
I wanna get away
But I will never get up
Oh won't you help me up
I rely on oxygen
I depend on the bitter snow
I rely on oxygen
I depend on the bitter cold
(I didn't know I could feel this low
So afraid that I'll watch you go
I didn't know I could feel this low
So afraid that I'll watch you go)
Take my strength out
But I'm not down
Write this reverse
I'm not down
I wanna run away
I wanna get away
But I will never get up
Oh won't you help me up
Take my strength out
But I'm not down
Write this reverse
I'm not downEmbed
