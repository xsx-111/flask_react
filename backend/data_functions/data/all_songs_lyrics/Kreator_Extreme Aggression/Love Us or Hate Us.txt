Love Us or Hate Us LyricsDon't try to tell us
What is right for us
We don't give a fuck anyway
Don't try to steal
Imagination from us
Things we believe
We will never betray
Those who has the power to
Suck us dry - throw us away
Those who never could create
Destroy the music of today
Those devoid of any feeling
Those who make the compromise
Betray themselves to make a deal
Sell their soul at any price
Sounds without feeling
Energy of aggressions
From money-hungry brains
And not from the heart
Fortune, fame and glory
Are their obsessions
Salesman, deaf to music
Blind to art
No honesty, just sterility
A cautious sound they make
Without creativity
It's still the same
As another age
When they took the words
Of truth and put them
To a flame
No more
Love us or hate us
No more
Love us or hate us
Some have eyes
And still can't see
Their plastic noise is
Anything but music to me
Mechanized and computerized
Switch off your brain and
Make sounds that dehumanize
No more
Love us or hate us
No more
Love us or hate us
Don't try to take our dreams
Away from us
We will never be like you
Love us or hate us
It doesn't matter to me
We don't want to be a part
Of this sick societyEmbed
