Some Pain Will Last Lyrics
Intense devastation of nature
Constructing a future for a man
The world is sold dirt cheap
For promises, no one can ever keep
There is no hope, just decay
Creation leads only to chaos
The seas full of tears they've created
A new kind of pain that lasts forever

The very first years of your life
Mother makes things right
But soon you just cannot deny
This is only a lie
We live in a world of hate and deceit
Corruption and greed
Wait, my friend, you will see
Misery's coming your way
Horror and pain
Reserved for you

Some pain will last, last forever
Some pain will last
Eternal slaves of morbid minds
Helpless and blind
Dealers of heartless oppression
Controlling mankind
Resistance is quelled, it's birth incomplete
No chance to succeed
And those, those who don't care
If you live or die
Are never around
To shoulder the blame

Some pain will last, last forever
Some pain will last

Time, time flies so fast you will feel
Still a child of tomorrow you'll be
A man full of hopes and of dreams
Dreams are destroyed easily, so easily
Dreams are destroyed so easily
Prepare, prepare for some pain yet unknown
Planned and arranged for so long
Chemical mutants arise
A generation born just to die, born just to die
A whole generation born just to die
Walking on thin ice
Lost in the storm's eye
Desolated oceans that one day
Were teeming with life
They conquered all the forests
And plundered all the seas
They tortured our souls and minds
With a pain that will last foreverEmbed
