Extreme Aggression Lyrics
Extreme aggression
From an extremely insane mind
Resting unconscious
Pushed up by white lines
Inhuman violence
I never thought it would come this far
Sadistic intensions
My greed for blood is growing more
And more

Extreme aggressions
Seeing you suffer brings pleasure to me
Extreme aggressions
My aggressions became too extreme to be
Kept under control

Hallucinations
From the darkest part of my brain
I still can't believe it
Am I really insane?
Hear screams from your torment
As I commit my heartless crime
I hear you pleading
But no one hears the screams
Of this soul of mine
Extreme aggressions
Ruining your life means nothing to me
Extreme aggressions
My aggressions became too extreme to be
Kept under control

Society, what have you done to me?
Society, bring you to your knees

Once before I die
Now that I have lost the will to live
Once before I die
I want to take revenge on
Those who've led me to

Extreme aggressions
My emotions, twisted by your lies
Extreme aggressions
Condemned my soul to hell for all timeEmbed
