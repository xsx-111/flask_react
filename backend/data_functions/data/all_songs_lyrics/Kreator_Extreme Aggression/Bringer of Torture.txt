Bringer of Torture LyricsYoung girl so sweet and once so innocent
Your life so brutal, true emotions suppressed
You scream, but he won't hear a word till he's had his away
Victim of the cruelest kind of love
Against his urges there's no defence
The one who gave you life stole your innocence
You want to be free at any cost, but you're chained by the shame
And all your hope seems to be lost

Bringer of torture
Bringer of torture
You're not afraid of dying
What could be worse than this life
You're terrified of the pain
That always returns every night

Bringer of torture
Bringer of torture
Insanity and terror, hand in hand
Childhood dreams comes to an end
The situation, so vile and insane will never be always
He's coming back again, again and again
