Betrayer LyricsThis is a song which
I use to describe what I feel
About people like you
No sense for humanity, no idea about life
This premise has been proved
You used my trust to satisfy your brainless lust
Your word isn't worth
More than puke in the dust
Betrayer!
Betrayer!
Misleader, you twisted things to satisfy
Deceiver, this greedy lust you can't deny
Betrayer!
Betrayer!
How could I be so naive
To believe all the lies
You so easily told
I think I've learned my lesson too late
The story took time to unfold
Now I see your true face
Behind your mask, a cheat, a fake
Your word isn't worth more than puke in the dust
Betrayer!
Betrayer!
Ignorant twisted mind
Maybe it would help
To think before you speak from time to time
Pretend to be a friend of mine
But you would sell your mother if you could
For less than a dime
Intelligence lost
Brain deceased
So you will loose
Fall to your knees
Guys like you I cannot stand
Maybe I must speak another language
Before you understand
Misleader, you twisted things to satisfy
Deceiver, this greedy lust you can't deny
Betrayer!
