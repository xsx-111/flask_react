Fatal Energy Lyrics
Lies, I can't stand these lies anymore
These tells about a better world
A better world for you and me
Hate, our hate is growing, that's for sure
Future thoughts till us with rage
Uncertainty about our fate

Cry out in fear of the future
Cry out in fear of the unknown
Cry out in fear of our planet
That the human race calls its own

And the gods are watching from lofty places
Indifferent to you and me
I wonder if their creations can handle
The violent forces of fatal energy

Violence, cruel violence in the minds of all
The killer instinct is still intact
It never leaves our minds alone
Greed, our greed will cause us to fall
Destroy the land of unborn sons
I hear them cry, I hear them call
Screaming in desperation
Screaming from hunger and pain
Scream for relief from this misery
Searching for someone to blame

And the gods are watching from lofty places
Indifferent to you and me
I wonder if their creations can handle
The violent forces of fatal energy

Easy, it's so easy to control our fate
Turn the world into a bomb
That destiny will detonate
Tomorrow, tomorrow it will be too late
When the children cry in the fear of death
A horrid death they can't escape

Crying tears of confusion
Crying for they don't understand
Crying because their young lives
Will be taken by their creator's hands
And the gods are watching from lofty places
Indifferent to you and me
The test is through, the human race
Destroyed, destroyed by the fatal energyEmbed
