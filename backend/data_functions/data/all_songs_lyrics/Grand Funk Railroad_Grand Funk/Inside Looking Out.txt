Inside Looking Out LyricsI'm sitting here lonely like a, a broken man
I serve my time doin' the, the best I can
Walls and bars they surround me
But, I don't want no sympathy
No baby, no baby
All I need is some tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burning oven
And, when my time is up, you'll be my reefer
Life gets worse on a God's green earth
Be my reefer, I got to keep smokin' that thing
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I said now baby, let me smoke it
Cause I feel good, yes, I feel good
It makes me feel alright
Feel alright
Feel alright, feel alright
Ice cold water runnin' through my veins, you know that
They try and drag me back to work again
Pain and blisters on my mind and hands
I work all day making up a, a nickel bag, nickel bags
The oats they're feeding me are driving me wild
I feel happy like a new born child
Now, when my time is up, you wait and see
These walls and bars won't keep that stuff from me
No, no, keep that stuff from me
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Make me feel alright
Make me feel alright
Make me feel all
You better c'mon up and get down with me
I'll make you feel real good, baby
Ah, just you walk and see
You make me feel alright
Make me feel alright
Said, I feel alright
Yes, I feel all, alright
Yes I, yes I, I, I, I, I2Embed
