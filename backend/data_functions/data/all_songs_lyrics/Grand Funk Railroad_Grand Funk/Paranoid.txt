Paranoid LyricsDid you ever have that feeling in your life
That someone was watching you?
He don't have no reason, that's right
But still he's there watching you
Someone is waiting just outside the door
To take you away, yeah
Everybody knows just what he's there for
To take you away, yeah
But, you don't know why he's been waiting
But, you don't know why he's been waiting
Spent too much time anticipating
Spent too much time anticipating, yeah
Did you ever think it could be you
That's just outside the door?
There's just one way to find out if it's true
So, what you waiting for?
Get yourself together now, my friend
And step outside the pad
If there's no one waiting for you there, my friend
I think you should be glad
But, who wasn't there that you should look out for?
(But, who wasn't there that you should look out for?)
Get back inside your wall, and shut the door
(Get back inside your wall, and shut the door)
You don't have nobody, don't need nobody, can't love nobody
You're better off by yourself
You ain't feelin' too bad, you're driving me mad and say you're bad
You're better off by yourself
You don't have nobody, don't need nobody, can't love nobody
You're better off by yourself
You ain't feelin' too bad, you're driving me mad and say you're bad
You're better off by yourselfEmbed
