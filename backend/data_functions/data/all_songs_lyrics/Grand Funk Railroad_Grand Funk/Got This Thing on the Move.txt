Got This Thing on the Move LyricsCome on over to my side, it's where you wanna be
Come on over to joy ride and let your morals be
Ain't no way to deny it, if it's in your soul
You don't know 'till you try it, baby, let the good time roll
Let me taste your life, let me fill your stream
Let me make you feel it right now, just lay back and dream
Got this thing on the move, it's beginnin'
Got a strange kind of feeling under my skin
I hear my baby knockin' at my front door
She knows what I got, she wants some more
And when it's all over, I start to come down
Think just a restin' place, I'll leave the groundEmbed
