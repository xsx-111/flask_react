If Not Now, Then When? Lyrics
(Check, check, check)

If not now, then when?
When the forest's nearly gone
When the hole's in the ozone
When the bees are gone
If not now, then when?
When the ocean's coming up
When the rain just won't stop
When the fire's burning
If not now, then when?

If not now, then when?
When Big Pharma's ripping me
When my data's tracking me
When my phone is spying
If not now, then when?
When my choicе is monitored
When computers arе cleverer
When our food is poison
If not now, then

This is an emergency
Need to act more quickly
This is no quandary
This is an emergency
Woo!
This is an emergency
Need to act more quickly
This is no quandary
This is an emergency

When the oceans turn to black
When the animals are dead
When the birds are gone
If not now, then when?
When the blue sky turns to black
When Gaia hangs by a thread
When all the people die
If not now, then when?5Embed
