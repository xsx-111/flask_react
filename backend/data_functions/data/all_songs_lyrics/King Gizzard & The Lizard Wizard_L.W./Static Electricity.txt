Static Electricity Lyrics

Split you and me, static electricity
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity

Singularity at the point of contacting
Lightning strikes deep inside digital cells in my mind
Torn apart like a baguette
Rip the husk from the brown rice
Lacerate the pig flesh and shape the machine out of clay
Blow the brain up in your hand and replace the ashes with static

Split you and me, static electricity
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity

Strangers divergent
They were once one, now they're two
Species come late to the fold
Ships in the night sail home
Cannonball falls from the sky
Sever the deck with a mind
Made of metal in plain sight
Invisible ball of death
Run by a rogue mutant brain
In a bubble of golden static
Split you and me, static electricity

Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity
Split you and me (Split you and me)
Static electricity
Split you and me (Split you and me)
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Split you and me
Static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricity
Split you and me, splitting bodies, static electricityEmbed
