East West Link Lyrics
All the highways like terminal airways
All the highways like sapien DNA

We can build a road
We can cut a tree
We can shoot a bird
Nobody will see

All the highways like terminal airways
All the highways like sapien DNA

Never ever wanna be on the other side of karma for digging underworld
Never wanna get up, never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world
Woo!
Woo!

We can kill the worms
Underneath the trees
We can tunnel in
Nobody will see
All the highways like terminal airways
All the highways like sapien DNA

Never ever wanna be on the other side of karma for digging underworld
Never wanna get up, never wanna get out of bed when I live in this world2Embed
