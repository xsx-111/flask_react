Supreme Ascendancy Lyrics
How can you get away with a murder?
Scot-free when you're found guilty in the first degree
It's pretty simple when you're so powerful
It's who you know
Untouchable, lying through your teeth
Break the doctrine, they're all laughing
Double-parking tax-free control monopoly
So complacent, it's adjacent to the demons you summon from your faculty

Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs

Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy

Satan in a cassock casting black magic
Childhoods tragically ripped from their shaking feet
Conscious yet inadequate
The bullshit catalyst
Far flung inaction by the ministry of presbytery
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
You're not above the law, no matter your beliefs
Supreme ascendancy, tomfoolery
Holy hands of God
Justice impedes

Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy
Supreme ascendancy
Permanent purgatoryEmbed
