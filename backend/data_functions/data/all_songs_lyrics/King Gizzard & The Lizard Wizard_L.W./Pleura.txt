Pleura Lyrics
Bone stock brewed up, graveyard shoot up
Came in trapdoor, thrown up on the floor
Servants of the lord of lung slaughter
The Necromancer
Woo!

Orange baby always squealing
Cradle snatch the new world fading
The final test, it takes your breath
Desecrates our grave
Woo!

Drink the blood of that you spill
Underneath the whippoorwill
One more piece of Jenga to pull
Then Necromancer will thank us all

Eager to assimilate
And I choose you to walk on your pleura

Drink the blood of that you spill
Underneath the whippoorwill
One more piece of Jenga to pull
Then Necromancer will thank us all
Suck the life from what you love
I learnt that from the orange one
No one to answer to after the fall
Necromancer will dance on us all
Drink the blood of that you spill (Pleura, Pleura, Pleura...)
Underneath the whippoorwill (Pleura, Pleura, Pleura...)
One more piece of Jenga to pull (Pleura, Pleura, Pleura...)
Then Necromancer will thank us all

Eager to assimilate
And I choose you to walk on your pleura
Cheat me out of living my life?
I exercise my right to die6Embed
