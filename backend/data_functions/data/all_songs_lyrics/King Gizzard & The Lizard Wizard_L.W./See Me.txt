See Me Lyrics

How can anybody see me when I am invisible and
How can anybody be the friend of someone impossible?
How can everything in my sight be so far into the distance?
How can every day I survive turn so easily to night?

How can anybody see me?
I'm invisible
How can anybody see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore


How can anybody see me when I am a hidden person?
How on earth can someone like me be intangible to others?
How do all the people do the things that pеople do around me?
How can anybody move whеn our planet is suffocating?

How can anybody see me?
I'm invisible (See me)
How can anybody see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore (See me)

How can anybody see me?
I'm invisible (See me)
How can anybody see me?
I'm a shadow here forevermore (See me)

See me, see me, see me, see me
