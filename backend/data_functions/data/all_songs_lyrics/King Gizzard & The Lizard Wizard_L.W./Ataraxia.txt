Ataraxia Lyrics
Take no position on good or bad
Much watched is the doing, so fuck the tarot's read
The life I lead, it has a taste
Like milk drank from the teat, curdles at a certain age

Get with ataraxia
Force it into being
Suck face
Ataraxia
Lower the ceiling
What if I amount to
Nothing at all?
Inside, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think

Shame the mirrors that stretch my hips
Mute the hypochondria that whispers spoilers in my ear
I'm not a father yet so don't ask again
Salt the snail and teach it to obtain

Lay in
Ataraxia
Set the kindling
Weigh in
Ataraxia
Absolve me of my skin
Shamе him, name him
Cut me down to size
Insidе, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think

Get with ataraxia
Force it into being
Suck face
Ataraxia
Lower the ceiling
What if I amount to
Nothing at all?
Inside, it hits me up
I care too much about what I think
Ataraxia
