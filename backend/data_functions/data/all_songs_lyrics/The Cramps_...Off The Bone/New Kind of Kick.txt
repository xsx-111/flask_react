New Kind of Kick Lyrics
Life is short
Filled with stuff
Don't know what for
I ain't had enough

I've learned all I know
By the age of nine
But I could better myself
If I could only find

Some new kind of kick
Something I ain't had
Some new kind of buzz
I wanna go hog mad

I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' for
Something I ain't had before
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' and lookin' to find

Some new kind of kick
Some new kind of kick
Gimme a kick
I want a kick
Like baby needs mom
Like Susie needs dick
This baby need
Some new kind of kick

I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick

I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' for
Something I ain't had before
I'm lookin' and lookin' and lookin' and lookin' to find

Life is short
Filled with stuff
Don't know what for
I ain't had enough

I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I want some new kind of kick
I wa-wa-wa-want
Energy
Bar code
Drano hotshot
Wack attack
Helium
Nitrous oxide
Formaldehyde
