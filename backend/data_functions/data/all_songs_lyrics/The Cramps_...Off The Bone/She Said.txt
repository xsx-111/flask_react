She Said Lyrics
Why's don't I tell you what it is?
I wen' out last nigh' and I got messed up
When I woke up this mornin'
Shoulda seen what I had inna bed wi' me
She comes up at me outta the bed
Pull her hair down the eye
Looks to me like a dyin' can of that commodity meat

And says
And says
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Wooooeeeeahhh!

So this time we got way over here
(Where?! Where?!)
I don't know, since it was early dawn's light
She jumped up outta the car
She pulled her hair down her eye
She looked to me like a dinosaur 'bout to jump outta that seat
She said
She said
She said
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Wooooeeeeyahhhh!

So this time we got way over here
And then we went way down here
We got all the way over
'n that lady sound like this:
Wooooo!
Wooooo!

She said
She said
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Yoo ee ah ah!
Wooooaaahhyahh!
So this time we went way over there
Now things was really gettin' goin'
Boilin' up with the blisters
She sound like this:
Woooo!
Woooo!
She jumped up outta the car
Pulled her hair down her eye
And do you know what she tol' me?
Do you know what she try to tell me?

She said
Woooo, it feel so goood!
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
Woo ee ah ah!
