Domino Lyrics
Well there's a cat in town that you might know
He goes by the name of Domino
Long key chain and a diamond ring
A blue sport car, he's a crazy thing
Oh, they love him so
And there goes Domino, Domino, Domino, oh

Well the girls all think he's a real gone guy
And they all flip when he walks by
Dandy clothes and big white shoes
Ready to go, never sings the blues
They love him so
And there goes Domino, Domino, Domino, waah

A cool black hair, and a solid style
Long side burns and a crazy smile
Just ask the girls and they'll tell you so
They dig that cat called Domino
Well they love him so
And there goes Domino, Domino, Domino, oh

Alright, go
Uh
Hey
Well, Domino come and go
Yeah, Domino, they love him so
Get out of the way
Here comes Domino, Domino, Domino, oh

Domino, go man, go
Domino, they love him so
Get out of the way
Here comes Domino, Domino, Domino, ohEmbed
