The Crusher LyricsRape!

Do the hammer lock
Do the hammer lock
Do the hammer lock, you turkey necks
Do the hammer lock
Do the hammer lock, you turkey necks
Everybody's doing it

Do the eye gouge
Do the eye gouge
Now do the eye gouge, you turkey necks
Now do the eye gouge
Do the eye gouge you, turkey necks
Everybody's doing it

All right, you turkey necks
I wanna teach you how to do the Crusher
And if you don't learn it now
I'm gonna get ya in the ring
Now first you take your fist
And you put it on your waist
Then you squeeze your partner's head
Until she's blue in the face
Yeah, do the crusher
Do the crusher
Do the crusher, you turkey necks
Do the crusher
Do the crusher, you turkey necks
Everybody's doing itEmbed
