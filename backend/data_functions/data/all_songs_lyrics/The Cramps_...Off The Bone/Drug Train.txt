Drug Train Lyrics
Hey people, all aboard the drug train!
Going to Plasteredville, Anyville, and Miltown (yaaaay!)

We're on the drug train
Have a nice day (thank you)
We're on the drug train
Now watch me get on board
I used to know where I was going
'Till I got on board the drug train

I'm going to show you how
To get on board
You put one foot up
You put another foot up
You put another foot up
And you're on board the drug train
(Hey people!)

All across the snow-capped mountains
Down in the tranquil valleys
Open up that Golden Gate
Don't fall off this drug train now
Woo-hoo, the drug train
I see Elvis with your mother
On the drug train
Sherlock Holmes looks for clues
There's something to do on the drug train
Sigmund Freud is slipping and sliding
With all of your friends on the drug train

Wow, the drug train, woo-woo
The drug train, woo-woo
Come on everybody and get on board the drug train, woo-woo
Come on everybody and get on board the drug train, woo-woo
The drug train, woo-wooEmbed
