Lonesome Town Lyrics
Some people call me a teenage idol
The smile and say they envy me
I guess they got no way of knowing
How lonely it can be

There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And we call it Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay

You can find a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is heart full of tears

Going down to Lonesome Town
Where the broken hearts stay
Going down to Lonesome Town
To cry all troubles away

In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
We can learn to forget
Maybe down in Lonesome Town
We can love to forgetEmbed
