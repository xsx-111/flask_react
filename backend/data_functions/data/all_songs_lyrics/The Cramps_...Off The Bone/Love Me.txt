Love Me LyricsAahh
Uhh, let's go!

Press your lips to mine
And whisper I love you
Gotta have chance that lasts
We've got a lot to do

Don't hesitate
I can't wait
...
Love me

You set my soul on fire
Every muscle in my body's burning with desire

Baby kiss me do
Make me know you're mine
Love me with desire
Oh honey, this is fine

Don't hesitate
I can't wait
...
Love me
You set my soul on fire
Every muscle in my body's burning with desire

I want you to be in my heart
Because it's a-runnin' wild
Got to make you mine
We've got a little time

Don't hesitate
I can't wait
...
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love meEmbed
