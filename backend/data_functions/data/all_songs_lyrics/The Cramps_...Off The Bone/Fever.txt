Fever Lyrics
No one knows how much I love you
No one knows how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's a-hard to bear

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever!
In the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever!
In the morning
Fever all through the night
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very bad affair
But when her daddy tried to kill him
She said, "Daddy-o don't you dare!"

"He gives me fever
When he kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever!
I'm his missus
So Daddy-o treat him right"

Everybody's got the fever
That is something we all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loves Juliet
Juliet, she felt the same
But when she put her arms around him
He said, "Julie, baby, you're to blame"
"You give me fever
When you kisses
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever!
In the morning
Fever all through the night"

Well, now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
The Cramps are born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade

We give you fever
When you're rocking
Fever 'til you live and learn
Fever!
Till you sizzle
But what a lovely way to burn

What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn1Embed
