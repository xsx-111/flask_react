Human Fly Lyrics
Well I'm a human fly
I, I said F-L-Y
I say buzz buzz buzz
And it's just becuz
I'm a human fly
And I don't know why
I got 96 tears and 96 eyes

I got a garbage brain
That's driving me insane
And I don't like the ride
So push that pesticide
And baby I won't care
'Cuz baby I don't scare
'Cuz I'm a reborn maggot using germ warfare
Rock

I'm a human fly
I said F-L-Y
I say bzz bzz bzz
And it's just becuz
I'm an unzipped fly
And I don't know why
And I don't know why
But I say
Bzzzzzzz
Rock tonight, and I say
Bzzzzzzz
Rocket ride, and I say
Bzzzzzzz
But I don't know why
Aw, I just don't know why3Embed
