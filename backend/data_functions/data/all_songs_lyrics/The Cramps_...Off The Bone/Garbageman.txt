Garbageman Lyrics
You ain't no punk, you punk
You wanna talk about the real junk?
If I ever said (BEEP) I'd be banned
Cause I'm your garbageman
Well, if you can't dig me, you can't dig nothing
Do you want the real thing, or are you just talking?
Do you understand?
I'm your garbageman
Yeah, now it's up from the garage and down the driveway
Now, get outta your mind or get outta my way
Now do you understand?
Do you understand?

Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-i
The bird's the word, and do you know why?
You gotta beat it with a stick
You gotta beat it 'til it's thick
You gotta live 'til you're dead
You gotta rock 'til you see red
Now do you understand?
Do you understand?
I'm your garbageman
Aw, dump that on mine...

Yeah, it's just what you need when you're down in the dumps
One half hillbilly and one half punk
Eight long legs and one big mouth
The hottest thing from the north to come out of the south
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Whoo, I can't lose with the stuff I use
And you don't choose no substitutes
So stick out your can
Cause I'm your garbageman
Here it comes now

Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-i
The bird's the word, and do you know why?
You gotta beat it with a stick
You gotta beat it 'til it's thick
You gotta live 'til you're dead
You gotta rock 'til you see red
Now do you understand?
Hmmmm?
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
All right, now goEmbed
