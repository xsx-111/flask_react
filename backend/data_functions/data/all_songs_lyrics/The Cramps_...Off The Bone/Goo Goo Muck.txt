Goo Goo Muck Lyrics
When the sun goes down, and the moon comes up
I turn into a teenage goo goo muck
Yeah, I cruise through the city and I roam the street
Looking for something that is nice to eat

You better duck
When I show up
The goo goo muck

I'm the night headhunter looking for some head
With a way out body underneath that head
Well I'll get you baby with a little luck
'Cause i'm teenage tiger and a goo goo muck

You better duck
When I show up
The goo goo muck


Yeah, the city is a jungle and I'm a beast
I'm a teenage tiger looking for a feast
I want the most but i'll take the least
'Cause i'm a goo goo muck tiger and a teenage beast
You'd better duck
When I show up
The goo goo muck

The goo goo muckEmbed
