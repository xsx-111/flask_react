The Way I Walk Lyrics
The way I walk is just the way I walk
The way I talk is just the way I talk
The way I smile is just the way I smile
Touch me baby and I'll go hog wild

The way I love is just the way I love
Come on and be the one I'm thinking of
Touch me baby, it feels so good
Sometimes I think I wanna but I don't know if I should, oh no

The way I walk is just the way I walk
The way I talk is just the way I talk
The way I smile is just the way I smile
Touch me baby and I'll go hog wild

The way I love is just the way I love
Come on and be the one I'm thinking of
Touch me baby, ooh, it feels so good
Sometimes I think I wanna but I don't know if I should, oh

The way you love me's got to cramp my style
Oh, little baby, I would say bye-bye
Love me, baby, love me right
Love me morning, noon and night, alright1Embed
