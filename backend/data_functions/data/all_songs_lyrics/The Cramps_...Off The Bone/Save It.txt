Save It Lyrics
Mwahahaha!
Mwahahaha!
Mmm...
Uh, uh, uh

Shakes me up to see you walk
It tears me up to hear you talk
You drive my nerves the way you pant
You got more love than I'll ever get

So save it baby, save it
Now don't you dare waste it (oh no)
Save it baby, save it
You don't know how I crave it
If love could kill the way you thrill
So save it all for me

I love the way you use your talk
The way you tremble in my heart
You got more love than I could miss
But I can't spare the smallest kiss
So save it baby, save it
You don't how I crave it
Save it baby, save it
Now, don't you dare waste it
If love could kill the way you thrill
So save it all for me, yeah

Uh, shake me up with your swingin' hips
You send my soul with your clingin' lips
Your loves like a well that won't run dry
I can't drink it all, but it's fun to try

So save it baby, save it
Now don't you dare waste it
Save it baby, save it
You don't know how I crave it
Love could kill the way you thrill
So save it all for me
So save it all for me
So save it all for meEmbed
