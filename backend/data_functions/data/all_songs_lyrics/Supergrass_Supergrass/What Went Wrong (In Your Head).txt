What Went Wrong (In Your Head) LyricsWhat went wrong in your head?
While we slept in our beds
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
What went wrong in your head?
We played along with what you said
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
What went wrong in your head?
God save the unstable, they stand alone
Ain't done no wrong, it's such a beautiful life
I'll need some salvation, wave you on
Ain't done no harm, with a wonderful life
What went wrong in your head?
While we slept in our beds
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
What went wrong in your head?
God save the unstable, they stand alone
Ain't done no wrong, it's such a beautiful life
I'll need some salvation, wave you on
Ain't done no harm, with a wonderful life
God save the unstable, they stand alone
They ain't done no wrong, it's such a beautiful life
I'll need some salvation, wave you on
Ain't done no harm, with a wonderful lifeEmbed
