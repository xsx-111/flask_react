Eon LyricsI know you're out there
We saw a shooting star
We don't know what you done
You're near for a star
But now we know it
We don't know who you are
We don't know what you done
You're near for a star
We're slowly fading
Your glow is almost gone
We don't know what you done
You're near for a starEmbed
