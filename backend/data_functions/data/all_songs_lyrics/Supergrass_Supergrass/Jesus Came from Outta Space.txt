Jesus Came from Outta Space LyricsJesus came from outta space and travelled from beyond the stars
He came down for peace on Earth and left in a second-hand car
The old men came to watch their sheep, lit their fire while the records played
Talked all night till they lost the plot, and they fell down the english way
Fell down the english way
Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you
Love'll talk, love'll walk, love'll speak out for you
Jesus came from outta space and travelled from beyond the stars
He came down for peace on Earth and left in a second-hand car
In the heavens with the planets in
All the stars seem to look my way (look my way)
Been so long since I came unstuck
Now tryna make you feel that way (tryna make you feel that way)
Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you
Love'll wide, love'll talk, love'll speak up for you
Love'll shake, love'll wake a way, love'll wake up with you
Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you
Come on brother have you lost your touch or have you gone and lost your way
A few hunters came to try their luck, but they died on the way to Bombay
Withered hands lay upon the rocks and raise your glass to the morning age
Next life's gonna be just fine
So I'll see you on the other side, I'll meet you on the other side
Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you
Love'll talk, love'll walk, love'll speak up for you
Love'll shake, love'll wake, love'll wake up with you
Love is all, love is tall, love is older than you
