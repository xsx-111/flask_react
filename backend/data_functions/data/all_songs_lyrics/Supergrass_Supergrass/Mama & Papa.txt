Mama & Papa LyricsWalk in the park and it's getting dark and I don't wanna be alone
Miss my mummy and I miss my daddy, won't you please bring them back home
Fly down the lane through the wind and the rain 'til the fires of the evening go
Miss my mummy and I miss my daddy, won't you please bring them back home
Drift in time as the mountains rise from the floor of the valley below
Seasons change as the rivers meet the sea
Walk in the park and it's getting dark and I don't wanna be alone
Miss my mummy and i miss my daddy, won't you please bring them back home
Tire of the trail as the daylight fails and the shadows of the east do grow
Miss my mummy and I miss my daddy, won't you please bring them back home
Side by side in the countryside with no thought for getting home
Distant stars are the only lights to see
Miss my mummy and I miss my daddy, won't you please bring them back homeEmbed
