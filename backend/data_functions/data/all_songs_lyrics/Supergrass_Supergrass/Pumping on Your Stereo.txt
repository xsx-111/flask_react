Pumping on Your Stereo Lyrics
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?

Well, life is a cigarette
Smoked to the end
But if you rock it a little bit
Then you burn all your friends

The wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes, it's true

Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?

Take a look through your window now
You're all alone on the road
Well, you'll burn all your bridges down
And now you're losing control
The wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes, it's true
If you make a mistake where you couldn't relate to your groove (Yes, that's true)

Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?

(Can you hear us humping on your stereo?)
Well, now that I met you
(Can you hear us humping on your stereo?)
I'll love you as a friend
(Can you hear us humping on your stereo?)
Yeah, but your love is mogadon
(Can you hear us humping on your stereo?)
Love is the end

Well, the wider your eyes, the bigger the lies, yes, it's true
If you make a mistake, well, you couldn't relate to your groove
Yes, it's true

Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can you hear us humping on your stereo?
Can we go home now?Embed
