Your Love LyricsMy love is at the window
I know my love is strange though
And when I said I feel low
She told me through the window
Well I know I'm gonna look right through
It's your love I'm gonna find
When I'm down, yeah I look right through
It's your loving coming by
You walked me through the meadows
We talked until the sun rose
And when I said I need love
You pushed me through the window
Well I know I'm gonna look right through
It's your love I'm gonna find
When I'm down, yeah I look right through
It's your loving coming by
When you know what you wannna do
Don't feel you're on your own, because you're all I see
Well, who knows what you're gonna do, I feel you may be gone
Well I know I'm gonna look right through
It's your love I'm gonna find
When I'm down, yeah I look right through
It's your loving coming byEmbed
