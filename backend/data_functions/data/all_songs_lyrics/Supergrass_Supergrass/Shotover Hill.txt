Shotover Hill LyricsAs the rain's coming down, well it soaks my shoes
There's a path that I'm on, so keep dry
Through the darkness, a glow that could reach everyone
When I come here I don't feel so alone, it's all right, I'm solarised
I'm just tryna carry on, with the life I made
And I know I'm gonna get there (know I'm gonna get there)
Hear the sound of the wind, it howls my name
In the cold light of day, you can see it in my eyes they've changed
When I come here I don't feel so alone, it's all right, it's solarised
I'll just try to carry on, with the life I made
And I know I'm gonna get there (know I'm gonna get there)
When I'm up here I know who I am, it's all right, I'm solarised
I'm just tryna carry on, with the life I made
And I know I'm gonna get there (know I'm gonna get there)
I said I know I'm gonna get thereEmbed
