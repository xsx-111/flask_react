Born Again LyricsWhatever you want, it's all right
There's still a place in my heart, it's all right
There's something calm
You'll need no arms
You're over the moon, she said
You keep me warm
Some other fawn
You're over the moon, she said
Whatever you want, it's all right
There's still a place in my heart, it's all right
Whatever you want, it's all right
There's still a place in my heart, it's all rightEmbed
