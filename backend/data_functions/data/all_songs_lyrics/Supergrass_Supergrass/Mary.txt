Mary Lyrics
I got a girl and her name is Mary
I like to shock her on a basis daily
I like to push you over into my stream
I like to point out that her teeth are green
I tell you stories that you won't understand
I'll have you eating from the palm of my hand
I'm gonna push you further into my dream
The back of every head hold something obscene

Ahhhhh... ay ya ya
Ahhhhh... ay ya ya

I get the feeling you're not ordinary
I got a head like falling masonary
I'll cut your strings, ah yes, a puppet machine
I watch you drop and fall apart at the seams
I meant to get you, let there be no doubt
You wanna try and get your teeth knocked out
I'm gonna push you further into my dream
The back of every head holds something obscene

Ahhhhh... ay ya ya
Ahhhhh... ay ya ya
Ahhhhh... ay ya ya
Ahhhhh... ay ya ya
Ahhhhh... ay ya ya
Ay ya yaEmbed
