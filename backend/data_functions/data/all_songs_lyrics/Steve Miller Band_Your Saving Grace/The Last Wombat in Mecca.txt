The Last Wombat in Mecca LyricsSpoken: The last wombat in Mecca. Take 1
There's some things I can't find
Some are better left alone
There are few things I won't find
Some are better left alone
Like that bulldog in the bathroom
Like that wombat on the phone
As I float in my Lear jet
Without a sling shot or a shield
As I hang in my Lear jet
Without a shotgun or a shield
Hey, a flying saucer wobbled past
With a bulldog at the wheel
Yeah
Can you give us a description
Said the Air Force on the phone
Can you certify you've seen this
Said the Air Force on the phone
No, but here's his passport
And his teeth mark's on the phone
If I take a long vacation
And nail my bulldog to a wall
If I leave this smoggy nation
And nail my bulldog to a wall
If my bulldog keeps his mouth shut
Will you remember me at allEmbed
