Feel So Glad LyricsThere are so many places
You have roamed
So many people
You have known
I know many of them you loved
Some are here, some are gone
None of them could love you
Cause I'm the only one
You've been away
Ohh, so long
And I need you
So, come on
Don't you be sad
Cause it won't be long
I know it's been bad
But you'll soon, soon be home
If I couldn't just be with you
Everything would be fine
If I couldn't just talk to you
It would ease your troubled mind
I'm your love
You're my woman
And you waited so patiently
Darling I'm waitin' here
Come on, come on, come on, come on home
There's so many things you got to hear
Some don't, don't stay away long
Don't stay away long
Well, listen little girl
You know I need you so
I'm savin' all of my love
And that's something you should know
The feeling's gettin' stronger
You know I can't get away
I've got to be with you baby
Each and every day
So hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry homeEmbed
