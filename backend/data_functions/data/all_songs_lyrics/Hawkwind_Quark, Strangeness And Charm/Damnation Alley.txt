Damnation Alley Lyrics
I've got the serum and I'm going to take it
All the way to Boston oh I've got to get through
The going won't be easy but I'm going to make it
It's the only thing that I'm cut out to do

Ride the post-atomic radioactive trash
The sky's on fire from the nuclear flash
Driving through the burning hoop of doom
In an eight wheeled anti-radiation tomb
Thank you Dr. Strangelove for going doolally
And leaving me the heritage of Damnation Alley

Damnation Alleyway

No more Arizona now Phoenix is fried up
Oklahoma City what a pity it's gone
Louisiana Delta where the Mississip's dried up
No more Chattanooga, Cherokee, Lexington


Damnation Alleyway
Damnation Alley
Damnation Alley
Damnation Alley
Damnation Alley

Damnation Alleyway

Radiation wasteland, radiation wasteland
Ashes coming at me, Craters coming at me now
The radiation wasteland
I've got my anti-radiation machine
Oh thank you Dr. Strangelove
I said thank you Dr. Strangelove
For giving me ashes and post-atomic dust
The sky is raining fishes it's a mutation zoo
Going down Damnation Alley Well good luck to you

Armour plated angel, motor-pony express
Armour plated angel, motor-pony express
Armour plated angel, motor-pony express
Armour plated angel, motor-pony express
Armour plated angel, motor-pony express
Armour plated angel, motor-pony express
Armour plated angel, motor-pony express
Armour plated angel, motor-pony express
Going down Damnation Alley
It's one hell of a mess
The sky is raining fishes it's a mutation zoo
Going down Damnation Alley
Well good luck to you
Good luck to you
