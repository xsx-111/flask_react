Fable of a Failed Race Lyrics
Our legends tell we came from a seed
That traveled at a whirlwind speed
'Til it came to rest upon this land
That once was green and is now all sand
That buried us up to our eyes
And made us watchers of the skies
'Til the shadow wings came for our sight
And left us to conspire with nightEmbed
