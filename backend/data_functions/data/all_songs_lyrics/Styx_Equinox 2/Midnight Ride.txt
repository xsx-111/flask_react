Midnight Ride LyricsMidnight ride
Midnight ride
I'm gonna get you while you sleep
Give you a dream you can keep
To yourself little mama gonna make you feel better
You know I'm gonna make you feel better
Well I'm your mystery man in a gold Lincoln
Ain't no reason to do any second thinkin' about it child
You know what I'm talking about child
Midnight ride
(And oh I'm gonna shake ya)
Midnight ride
(Well I'm gonna break ya)
Midnight ride
(Well I'm gonna take you on a)
Midnight ride
Shake yourself
I meet you little girl back at my hotel
Between you and me we're really gonna give 'em hell
I got something mighty special up my sleeve
All you got to do is just say please
I wanna please your mama
Midnight ride
(Well I'm gonna shake ya)
Midnight ride
(Well I'm gonna break ya)
Midnight ride
(Well I'm gonna take you on a)
Midnight ride
I meet you little girl back at my hotel
Between you and me we're really gonna give 'em hell
I got something mighty special up my sleeve
Of all you got to do is just say please
Midnight ride
(Well I'm gonna shake ya)
Midnight ride
(Well I'm gonna break ya)
Midnight ride
(Well I'm gonna take you on a)
Midnight ride
Midnight ride
Midnight ride
Midnight ride
