The Medic Lyrics
She says, "You always smell like cigarettes
And there's always whiskey on your breath
But you're the best that I can do
And I, I think I love you."

Now if you want me to slow down
Just tell me to slow down
Now if you want me to slow down
Just tell me to slow down
Because I want to be loved
Because I want to be loved

She says, "You don't love me you just love sex
But I can't wait around for something better than this
Because you're the best that I can do
And I, I wish I could leave you."

Now if you want me to slow down
Just tell me to slow down
Because I want to be loved
Because I want to be loved
Because I want to be loved
Because I want to be loved6Embed
