Inuit Lyrics
Oh, pure heart's peer caught me gawking
Your hair in the wind, such small lonesome hands
I think I was meant to keep you warm

It was bigger than me
It was bigger than the sea
And I'm not waving, I'm drowning

I felt your waves calming comely
Lights on as is angles casting sides
Infinity and all watered the moon
It was more than I could care

I felt your waves calming comely
Lights on as is angles casting sides
Infinity and all watered the moon
And I'm not waving, I'm drowning

I felt your weights crushing contours
And I felt cascades ripping right through me
My brightest love sent from tundras
Your Arctic touch
My brightest love, it was more than I shared
It was more than you cared
I felt your waves calming comely
Lights on as is angles casting sides
Infinity and all watered the moon
And I'm not waving, I'm drowning3Embed
