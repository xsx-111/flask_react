Rory Lyrics
I wrote you a letter
Asked your best friend to send it
But took to the sea before you could have read it
Retreated to snowcapped waters of the unknown
Extracted my heart while it was still beating
But glowing and red
And I swear that sweat would
Envelop your arms if you broke down and held it

I swear I'm a good man
I swear I'm a good man
So why don't you love me back?
So why don't you love me back?

Instead of twisting up words you just sat there in silence
In wind burnt homes sighing rays from a sunset
And all I could hear was the sound of the wasp nest
My head made a home for the hum of the insects
But my hands shake and shudder at the mention
Of half-written reasons why we'll only be friends

I swear I'm a good man
I swear I'm a good man
So why don't you love me back?
So why don't you love me back?
So why don't you love me back?
So why don't you love me back?
So why don't you love me back?12Embed
