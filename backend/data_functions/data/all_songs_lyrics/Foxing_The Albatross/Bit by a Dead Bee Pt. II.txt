Bit by a Dead Bee Pt. II LyricsOld soul, this feels ugly
Quiet skies seem so low
With the ring of the rising tide
Melancholy feels just like me
Alone, not lonely
I think I'm so detached
That I don't feel sound for anyone anymore
Young soul, apricot belly
I just enthrall and disappoint
Enthrall and disappoint
Enthrall and disappoint
Enthrall and disappointEmbed
