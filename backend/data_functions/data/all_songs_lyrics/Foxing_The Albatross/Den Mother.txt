Den Mother Lyrics
You watched a lukewarm ocean from an archipelago
I fell asleep to the sounds of the cape
As water rushed my nose

And then I swore by my own soul that god would right our wrongs
And then you faked a smile and whispered to me
"Je te fais confiance
So don't go home tired and alone."

If nothing becomes
If nothing becomes
At least soft light lay on us
At least soft light lay on us
If nothing becomes
If nothing becomes
At least soft light lay on us
At least soft light lay on us2Embed
