Bloodhound Lyrics
My bloodhound baying at your door
The wild grass overlapping the front porch
The sound of scratching claws trimmed short
Keeps you buttoned up on the floor
And you're reduced to howls
And I'm not there to drown them out
Swallowing up the room
Letting yourself down

Darling I'll be fine
(The hiccups my mouth emits)
I've left behind my calluses
(This solicitude I won't forgive)
I'll be whatever you like
(All of this inside my head)
I'll be whatever you like
(All of this inside my head)
Your seafaring love to the shore

When the tide rolled in there was nothing left
But an albatross hanging from my neck
And just as you could not contain the sea
You could not contain me3Embed
