Selbstdarstellung
Gay Talese
Ronald Rocking
Euthanasia
Use the words like flowing river touches
Embraces parting hard steel surfaces revealing pages
Beneath the water skin broken like ice flows
Smashed by iron bows on the back of a whale
Comma comma-comma comma-comma comma-ca-ca-ca-ca
Commai comma-commai comma-commai comma-ca-ca-ca-ca
Commu-a commu-a commu-a commun
Communicate
Selbstarstellung
Open hearted
Soon forgotten
But never parted
Com com communicate
Communication
Communicate communicate
Via satellite or solid state
Never never hesitate
Communicate communicate
Communicate communicate
Never never hesitate
Reaching, leaning, scratching vainly
Faces dancing, locked lipped, between thigh secret
Briolette tears drip from frozen masks
As all those death-throe questions don't get asked
Comma comma-comma comma-comma comma-ca-ca-ca-ca
Commai comma-commai comma-commai comma-ca-ca-ca-ca
Commu-a commu-a commu-a commun
Communicate
Communicate
Communicate communicate
Via satellite or solid state
Never never hesitate
Communicate communicate
Communicate communicate
Never never hesitate
Communicate
Never hesitate
Never never hesitate
Communicate communicate
