Man Watching LyricsHe's a fool let's you know's who you say
You can see him coming a mile away
He's got his lapel cut just a little over displayed
And his shoes could be a problem could get in the way
Watch that man
He's your problem
Got something for ya between his toes
Watch that man
He's your contact
He's got his feather shoved right up your nose
He was born in the future
He's getting born here sometime soon
Getting born in the future
He may made up this rule
They put out a police description out for this guy
You know the kind of a guy with a kind of disguise
I don't know quite if his shoulders are wide
Or quite blue was his blue blue eyes
How wide are his ties
How smooth are his eyes
How big are his feet
He dresses so neat
But he's being followed, followed in the street right now
Just like you and me
Too tong too chong who really cares
If your born with long blond hair
On the boarder was the smoggers and bald pieores
And down on 42nd street with all the love flow whores
Watch that man
He's your problem
Got something for ya between his toes
Watch that man
He's your contact
He's got his feather shoved right up your nose
He was born in the future
Tomorrow we can bring another for the new world
Tomorrow we will bring another soul
Tomorrow we can bring another for the new world
Tomorrow we will bring another soul
Tomorrow we can bring another for the new world
Tomorrow we will bring another soul
Tomorrow we can bring another for the new world
Tomorrow we will bring another soul
He was born in the future
He's getting born here sometime soon
Getting born in the future
He may made up this ruleEmbed
