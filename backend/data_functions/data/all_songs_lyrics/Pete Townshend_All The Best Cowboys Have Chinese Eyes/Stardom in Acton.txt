Stardom in Acton LyricsStardom in Acton, that's all they got
Stardom in Acton, that's all they got
Stardom in Acton, that's all they got
Just like the grub that wriggles to the top of the mass
I'm the first to get hooked
Just like the stub of that long cigarette full of hash
I'm the last to get booked
But I'm capable
My love's inescapable
Conquering lethargy
I've got energy
(Stardom) I want a hit
Want my tan, want my cash, want my innocence
(Stardom) I want a script
Want my band, want my stash, want omnipotence
I'll go where the senescent soldier retires
And shiver in south California
Watching the storms and the tangling wires
And rivers that meet on the corner
Like some prostitute
Handing 'round the loot
I am not ashamed
I will stake a claim
(Stardom) Born in a trunk
Got my home, got my car, got stability
(Stardom) I'm Hollywood's son
All alone don't admire anonymity
I'm so angry that you turned me on
I didn't remain your friend too long
I'm so angry that you turned me on
I didn't stay your friend for too long
I'm so angry that you let me see
My totally futile destiny
I'm so angry, you interrupted my dream
Now I know that the power rests in me
(Stardom) I want a hit
Want my tan, want my cash, want my innocence
(Stardom) I want a script
Want my band, want my stash, want omnipotence
(Stardom) Born in a trunk
Got my home, got my car, got stability
(Stardom) But I'm Hollywood's son
All alone don't admire anonymity
Stardom in Acton, that's all they got
Stardom in Acton, that's all they got
Stardom in Acton, that's all they got
Stardom in Acton, that's all they got
Stardom
