Vivienne LyricsTownshend
Vivienne, I could have loved you
Vivienne, you went too far
Faker, that's what I been
With my make up and my false address
Shake up, that's what I seen
I was taken by balls I guess
I got to know but feeling I'm height inside light inside, where has it gone ?
I got to crawl on the beaches and side the line, find the time, I've got to win this time
Where have you gone ?
I'm kicking out in the tracks and the secrets of Babylon
I's kicking down on the directions screw back to Abalone
I feel the same as my friends and my enemies tell me this, who should I blame ?
Am I too live busted head show me why ? Is your kiss just like his, just like his kiss
Are all men the same ?
Vivienne, I could have loved you
Vivienne, I could have loved you
Vivienne
Vivienne
Faker, that's what I been
With my make up and my false address
Shake up, that's what I seen
I was taken by balls I guess
I got to know where the feeling I'm height inside light inside, where has it gone ?
I got to crawl on the beaches and side the line, find the time, I've got to win this time
Where have you gone ?
I could have loved you
Vivienne, I came so only to taking a place at your bar
Innocence up from a trade for a word
Vivienne, you went too farEmbed
