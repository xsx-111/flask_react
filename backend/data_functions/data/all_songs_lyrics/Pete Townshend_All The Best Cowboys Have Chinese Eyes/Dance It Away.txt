Dance It Away LyricsThey say we've got nothing left, (Nothing on the ground)
They say we used it all up (in the desert ground)
Got to be so careful with the rest (we'll break it down)
Or else the nukes are gonna play it tough
Well, I can't stand pessimistic, (uptown)
My creepers got to have their faith , (wait around)
There's only one answer I can think of, (another sound)
Just get up and dance it away
Dance it away
Come on and Dance it away
Come on and dance it away
Get up and dance it away
There are children at the bottom of the ocean, (body now)
And, it's so hard to be so far away, (all around)
Some people have forgotten the explosion, (buff your shoes)
Still throwing punches everyday
We'll still like to think we're human, (and we will say)
And we're gonna drown in our own sweet way, (will get you down)
At times it looks confusing, (take it back)
But, Mr. Can we dance it away
Dance it away
Come on and dance it away
Dance it away
Get up and dance it away
Don't worry, Don't worry, Don't worry
Just dance it away
(music break)
Don't worry, Don't worry, Don't worry
Just dance it away
They say we've got nothing left, (nothing on the ground)
They say we used it all up, (in the desert ground)
Got to be so careful with the rest, (we'll break it down)
Or else the nukes are gonna play it tough
Well, I can't stand because of my stick, (uptown)
My creepers got to have their faith, (wait around)
There's only one answer I can think of, (another sound)
Just get up and dance it away
Come on dance it away
Why don't you just dance it away
Come on and dance it away
Get up and dance it away
Don't worry, Don't worry, Don't worry
Just dance it awayEmbed
