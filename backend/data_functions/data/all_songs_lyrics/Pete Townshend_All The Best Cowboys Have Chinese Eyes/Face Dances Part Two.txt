Face Dances Part Two LyricsI watch you sit and twitching
With a match between your teeth
You seem to have a knack of moving it
It's in time to the beat
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
I can't be distracted
By the stuttering of the kids
I just sit, enraptured
By your fluttering eyelids
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
I can only stare
You make me feel
Like I don't care
I can only stare
You make me feel
Like I don't care
I can only stare
You make me feel
Like I don't care
Your eyes explain a story
That never had a start
Your brow reveals the glory
That's hidden in your heart
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
Your skin is fine china
White as winter snows
Your lips are always shining
Turning up your nose
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
(I can only stare) Face dances tonight
(You make me feel) Fate chances moonlight
(Like I don't care) Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
(I can only stare) Face dances tonight
(You make me feel) Fate chances moonlight
(Like I don't care) Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
(I can only stare) Face dances tonight
(You make me feel) Fate chances moonlight
(Like I don't care) Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
(I can only stare) Face dances tonight
(You make me feel) Fate chances moonlight
(Like I don't care) Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
(I can only stare) Face dances tonight
(You make me feel) Fate chances moonlight
(Like I don't care) Face dances tonight
Fate chances moonlight
(I can only stare) Face dances tonight
(You make me feel) Fate chances moonlight
(Like I don't care) Face dances tonight
