Exquisitely Bored LyricsThe tissue box is empty
No coffee for my cream
Dogs howl in the alley
Crazy women scream
Some kids shout from their pick up truck
They're stoned on life and beer
Fifty radios playing in this street
But I'm still hardly here
Exquisitely bored in California
We take our trouble to the Crest
Exquisitely bored in California
Exquisitely bored, just like all the rest
When the sun shines, things'll get moving
You feel close to the stars
There are good times walking in Laguna
But it rains in my heart
The peasants here are starving
They look like barrels out in space
Pray TV looks like pay TV to me
It's just a curse on the human race
I take a drive up to L.A
In my gas guzzling limousine
There's a whole lot of crazy people up there
Living out a life in sweet ennui
Exquisitely bored in California
We take frustration to the Crest
Exquisitely bored in California
Exquisitely bored, just like all the rest
When the sun shines, things'll get moving
You feel close to the stars
There are good times walking in Laguna
But it rains in my heart
Exquisitely bored in California
We take our trouble to the Crest
Exquisitely bored in California
Exquisitely bored, just like all the restEmbed
