North Country Girl LyricsWhen you travel to the green hills of Ayr
Where the sea breaks windows on the border line
Remember me to a girl who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
Please see for me that her red hair is long
And flows and curls down to her back and breast
Please see for me that her red hair is long
For that's the way I remember her best
North country girl (Oh-oh-oh)
North country girl (Oh-oh-oh)
North country girl (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
North country girl
See that she's warm when the summer ends
When trees are bare and the rivers freeze
She washes her clothes where the river bends
She's working on her knees
See for me that her coat's pulled up close
And her beret frames her sweet, pretty face
See that she's warm and drink her a toast
For I am exiled in a lonely place
Please let me know if she remembers me at all
A hundred times I've hoped and prayed
That way up there near the Roman wall
She didn't suffer when the fall-out sprayed
North country girl (Oh-oh-oh)
North country girl (Oh-oh-oh)
North country girl (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
