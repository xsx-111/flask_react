Stop Hurting People LyricsA love born once must soon be born again
A spark that burned, then died, leaving cinders to be fanned
By the wind and thrown to flame
Flames like tongues impassioned in a moments burst
Tell me, friend, why do you stand aloof from your own heart?
The truth confronts you, the truth confronts you as the sea
Crushing with out detail
Impassioned and detached
Killing with love and power in God's Name
People stop hurting people
People stop hurting people
Love conquers poses
Love smashes stances
Love crushes angles into black
So you, without question
Know your first love is your last
And you will never, you never, never, you'll never love again
But always wish to walk with her into restaurants, it's a clammy tale
To be seen beside her at the public bar footrail
I always wanted to be matched with her
Yet her beauty was so different to mine
My "beauty" needs an understanding and a knowledge of what I am
Hers is enough, earned through eons, for that is what true beauty is
Time's gift to perfect humility
May I be matched with you again
I know the match is bad
But God help me
May I be matched with you again
I know the match is bad
But God help me
May I be matched with you again
I know the match is bad
God help me
May I be matched with you again
Without your match, there is no flame
People stop hurting people

People stop hurting people
People stop hurting people
People stop hurting people
People stop hurting people
