The Sea Refuses No River LyricsI remember being richer than a king
The minutes of the day were golden
I recall that when the joint passed 'round
My body felt a little colder
But now I'm like a sewer channel
Running lime and scag
Let me get at the master panel
Let me at my stack
The sea refuses no river
And right now
This river's banks are blown
The sea refuses no river
Whether stinking and rank
Or red from the tank
Whether pure as a spring
There's no damn thing stops the poem
The sea refuses no river
And this river is homeward flowing
I have seen a trace of strain
In other's eyes, not spoken
I must admit that I enjoyed their pain
But this time it's me that's broken
I demand for you and His
This must be the time
When we decide what freedom is
Turn water into wine
For the sea refuses no river
We're polluted now
But in our hearts still clean
The sea refuses no river
We tried not to age
But time had it's rage
We're washed over the stones
From babies into clones of the mean
The sea won't refuse this muddy river
Won't deny the sulfurous stream
There was a fool in a dressing robe
Riding out the twilight hour
Lonely and cold in an empty home
Trying to assess his power
But now he's like a stream in flood
Swollen by the storm
He doesn't care if he sheds his blood
Let him be reborn
The sea refuses no river
Remember that
When the beggar buys a round
The sea refuses no river
And rain fills the gutters
No time for stutters
This is our chance
To sing and to dance and to clown
The sea refuses no river
And rivers were sprung to drown
The sea refuses no river
No pecking code
Respected for the damned
The sea refuses no river
Whether starving and ill
Or strung on some pill
Just 'cos you own the land
There's no unique hand plugs the dam
The sea refuses no river
And the river is where I am
The river is where I am1Embed
