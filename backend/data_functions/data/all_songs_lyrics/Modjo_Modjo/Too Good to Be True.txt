Too Good to Be True LyricsI saw some sad times I said
I'd had enough of heartbreak
I told myself that I could never fall again
Then sure as fate she came, I
Just had to get to her and
She gave me all her numbers, gave me all her names
Cold and lonely without you
Don't know if I can make it through
Maybe you'll hear this song
You been gone way too long
Too good to let it go, too good to be true
We left and we went home
Unbelievable
I looked into her eyes, thunder in my heart
And we were joined forever
Our bodies slick together
I told her everything, confessions in the dark
Cold and lonely without you
Don't know if I can make it through
Maybe you'll hear this song
You been gone way too long
Too good to let it go, too good to be true
She painted inspiration
Onto my fractured soul, I
Was never sure she knew how much she meant to me
She never trusted me, I know she didn't see
The night she left she killed the heart inside of me
Cold and lonely without you
Don't know if I can make it through
Maybe you'll hear this song
You been gone way too long
Too good to let it go, too good to be true
Cold and lonely without you
Don't know if I can make it through
Maybe you'll hear this song
You been gone way too long
Too good to let it go, too good to be trueEmbed
