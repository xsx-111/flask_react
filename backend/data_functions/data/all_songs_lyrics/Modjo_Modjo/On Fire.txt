On Fire LyricsIt's hard to believe, but I realise it's true
You make me feel, that I'm out to get to you
What you going to do, when the evening comes?
Just give in to me, let me sail on your cloud
My heart's on fire
Full of desire
Gotta make it better
C'mon, try harder
Hearts on sober
Let me take you higher
This burning desire
Will make you surrender
Tone it down, I don't want to go straight
But now is the time, and our love is here to stay
So we had to do, what you done to me
Won't get no relief, if I don't have you
My heart's on fire
Full of desire
Gotta make it better
C'mon, try harder
Hearts on sober
Let me take you higher
This burning desire
Will make you surrender
(My heart's on fire, full of desire
Gotta make it better, c'mon, try harder)
My heart's on fire
Full of desire
Gotta make it better
C'mon, try harder
Hearts on sober
Let me take you higher
This burning desire
Will make you surrender
My heart's on fire...
Full of desire...
Gotta make it better...
C'mon, try harder...
My heart is on fire...
Hearts on sober
Let me take you higher
This burning desire
Will make you surrenderEmbed
