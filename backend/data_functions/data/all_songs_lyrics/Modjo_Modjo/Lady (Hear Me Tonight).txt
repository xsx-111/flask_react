Lady (Hear Me Tonight) Lyrics
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel love, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
Lady (Lady)
Hear me tonight (Hear me tonight)
'Cause my feeling ('Cause my feeling)
Is just so right (Is just so right)

Lady (Lady)
I just feel like (I just feel like)
I feel love (I feel love)
For the first time (For the first time)

Lady (Lady)
Hear me tonight (Hear me tonight)
Can't you see (Can't you see)
You're my delight (You're my delight)

Lady (Lady)
I just feel like (I just feel like)
I won't get you (I won't get you)
Out of my mind (Out of my mind)

Lady (Lady)
Hear me tonight (Hear me tonight)
'Cause my feeling ('Cause my feeling)
Is just so right (Is just so right)18Embed
