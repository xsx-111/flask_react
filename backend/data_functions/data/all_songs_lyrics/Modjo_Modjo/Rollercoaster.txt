Rollercoaster LyricsBreathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Rollercoaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time
Leave me standing here, act like I'm not around
The coast will probably never clear, can I please go
Home now
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in
And there I stay
Lay beside me and listen at the wall
We'll keep on lying until the summer comes
I had that dream about you again
Where you drive my car right off the fucking cliff
And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Rollercoaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time
Make me promise that I will never tell
All I remember's the way her bedroom smelled
I had that dream about you again
Where I wait outside until you let me in
And now I'm breathing deeply, walking backwards
Finding strength to call and ask her
Rollercoaster favorite ride
Let me kiss you one last time good night
Good nightEmbed
