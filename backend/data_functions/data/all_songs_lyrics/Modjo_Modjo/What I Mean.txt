What I Mean Lyrics
What I mean
What I am
What I feel about the meaning of my life
What I need
What I fear
What I like to say and what I lie about

Well I can't get used to it
Or get her off my mind
The way she stole my feelings
And I just can't even cry

I should run my way back home by now
Because I gave her everything I got
I can't stand the way she broke my heart
Because I gave her

All my dreams
All my hopes
All the things I love and that I used to know
God I pray everyday
But I feel so empty since she went away
Well I can't get used to it
Or get her off my mind
The way she stole my feelings
And I just can't even cry

I should run my way back home by now
Because I gave her everything I got
I can't stand the way she broke my heart
Because I gave her


Well I can't get used to it
Or get her off my mind
The way she stole my feelings
And I just can't even cry
This wound may last forever
Or maybe till I die
So I keep holding on
Until I get another try

I should run my way back home by now
Because I gave her everything I got
I can't stand the way she broke my heart
No I can't stand the way she broke my heart
I should run my way back home by now
Because I gave her everything I got
I can't stand the way she broke my heart

I should run my way back home by now
I can't stand the way she broke my heartEmbed
