Peace of Mind LyricsEverybody says that it's not hard to see
What you would like to be
What is the destiny
What you'd like to take and what you'd like to leave
You know I'd love to see
People all around me say that I'm a fool
But it's so hard to choose
When it's just up to you
Have you ever felt your life so tragedy
I was sold to play the game
But I didn't have a name
And I waited all my life to find my own
Have you ever felt like you had to be
Like everyone you see
So you know how to feel
Did you realise it, did it set you free?
D'you know what my mind is made of?
And I don't need to maybe
Got to get rid of these??? inside myself
When it takes some time (some time)
For to draw the line (draw the line)
Will you leave me blind
Because I can't give you what you need
When the creeping inside
When the feeling drowned
I can make you change your mind
People all around me say that I'm a fool
But it's so hard to choose
When it's just up to you
On and on I feel my life, so tradegy
When it takes some time (some time)
For to draw the line (draw the line)
Will you leave me blind
Because I can't give you what you need
When the creeping inside
When the feeling drowned
Can I make you change your mind
Take some time (some time)
For to draw the line (draw the line)
Will you leave me blind
Oh, because I can't give you what you need
When the creeping inside
When the feeling drowned
Won't you leave me blind
(But I can't give you what you need)
Take some time
For to draw the line
Will you leave me blind
When the creeping inside
When the feeling drowned
Let me believe you changed your mindEmbed
