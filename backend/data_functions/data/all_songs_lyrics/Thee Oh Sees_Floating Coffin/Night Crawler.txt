Subtle slayer
Ruined kids again
Put their light out
It's all dark again
And what about parents?
Lost their kids again
And their answer?
Holding hands again
Whoa the children
Falling down a hole
They pull their lives out
Now they're in a hole
What if we're cancelled?
Not so good right now
And what about future?
Without kids aroundEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
