Tunnel Time LyricsHave a look under dishes
And behind the TV
I'll be flipping your lights out
And all the space in between
Can't remember the faces
Or even the names
I've been cleaning up bodies
They all look the same to me
I've been filling the tunnels
With my lantern at night
Slowly scratching the names off
The walls of the mind for goodEmbed
