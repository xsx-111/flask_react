Strawberries 1 + 2 LyricsSweet cannonball
We are neutral
We don't belong here
We are not persons
But I don't really know
Stand the slayer
Say it normal
Where you are
You take it personal
I don't readily know
Say it low
Information
Say it slow
So I learn it
I don't readily know
We are future
We are persons
Without weapons
How refreshing
I don't readily knowEmbed
