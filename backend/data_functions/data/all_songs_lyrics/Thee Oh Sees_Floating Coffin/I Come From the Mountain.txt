I Come From the Mountain LyricsWell, early morning underneath the city
In a tunnel calling "Rescue me!"
I come from the mountain, I've returned again
Without a tear, naturally
Get out, whoo!
Well, early morning underneath the city
In a tunnel calling "Rescue me!"
I come from the mountain, I've returned again
Without a tear, naturally
Yeah, whoo!
Girls like to smile half the time
Boys are the trouble all the time
Sitting in their pockets just a dime
Lifting hefty spirits from the slime
No one likes a heartache or the kind
Everyone's a problem sometimes
Flipping over secrets day and night
Flipping out our insides, what a fright!1Embed
