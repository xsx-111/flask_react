Maze Fancier LyricsA grave inside a cave
A maze inside a maze
Won't grow inside of me
Nothing inside of me
Get lost too soon
Turn around confused
No brains inside of me
No brains inside of me
A grave inside a cave
A maze inside a maze
Won't grow inside of me
Nothing inside of me
Get lost too soon
Turn around confused
No brains inside of me
No brains inside of meEmbed
