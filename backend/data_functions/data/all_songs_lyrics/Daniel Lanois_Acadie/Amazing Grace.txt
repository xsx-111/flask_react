Amazing Grace LyricsAmazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found
Said I was blind but now I see
Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Twas grace that brought me safe this far
And grace shall lead me home
I once was lost but now I am found
Said I was blind but now, now I see the lightEmbed
