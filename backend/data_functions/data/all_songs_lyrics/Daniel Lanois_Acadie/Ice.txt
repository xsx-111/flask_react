Ice LyricsYes, it's cold by the river where you lay
In this godless place I kneel down and I pray
God help us through the night
God help us through the night
Your voice would fill the night
I think of yesterday
I want to hold you
Your worn out hands don't touch me now
Your words don't mean anything
God help us through the night
God help us through the night
Through this foolish night
In your golden arms I want to cry
I want you to hold me
Evil comes, slips through the dark night
'Cause it's cold by the river where you lay
God help us through the night
God help us through the night
Through this foolish night
In your golden arms I want to cry
Yes, it's cold by the river where you layEmbed
