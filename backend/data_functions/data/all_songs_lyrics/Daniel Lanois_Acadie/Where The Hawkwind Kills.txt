Where The Hawkwind Kills LyricsThe suburb walls are closing in
I've looked at you and I've seen you
Through your curtain
With a naked eye from not far
I've shed a tear for you
A flowing fountain
Flaming trees
I'm lost in fields of your hair
From where the hawkwinds kill
And the blood runs thin
I'll go now
Fly I will
From inside the gates of the stripping yard
I can't touch you, I can't feel for this Thunder Town
I want you now while my body's young
My mind is strong away from Thunder Town
From where the hawkwind kills
And the dam runs deep
In this land of heaven
Not so sweet
I turn my back to a godless night
I hear the mighty stranger over Thunder Hill
From where the hawkwinds kill
And the blood runs thin
I'll go now
Fly I will
Over the mountain I must go
To see the valley below
Thunder TownEmbed
