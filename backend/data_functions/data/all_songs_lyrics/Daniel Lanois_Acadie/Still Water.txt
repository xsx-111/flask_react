Still Water LyricsSad eyes, sad eyes
Where you going with that confidence?
Sad eyes, sad eyes
Where you going with that confidence?
I'm going to where the boats go by
Calidonia river flow so wide
I'm going to where the boats go by
Calidonia river flow so wide
Still water, laying over
Still water, laying over
Still water, laying over
Calidonia river oh so wide
Wild eyes in the wilderness
Where you going with the devil in hand?
Wild eyes in the wilderness
Where you going with the devil in hand?
I'm going to build the bridges high
For working money, for working money
I'm going to climb the bridges high
Calidonia brother far away
Still water, I'm laying over
Still water, lay my body down over
Still water, laying over
Calidonia river far away
Sad eyes in the weary night
Have you seen your brother? Have you seen your brother?
Waiting by the river Grand
Caledonia river oh so wide
Going to where the rain falls
Look for my brother, look for my brother
Going to where the rain falls
Caledonia river far away
Still water, laying over
Still water, lay my body down
Still water, laying over
Caledonia river far awayEmbed
