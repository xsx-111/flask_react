Motherly Love Lyrics
Motherly love
Motherly love
Forget about the brotherly and other-ly love
Motherly love is just the thing for you
You know your Mothers' gonna love ya 'til ya don't know what to do

The Mothers got love that'll drive ya mad
They're ravin' 'bout the way we do
No need to feel lonely, no need to feel sad
If we ever get a hold on you
What you need is...

Motherly love (Come on, get it now)
Motherly love
Forget about the brotherly and other-ly love
Motherly love is just the thing for you
You know your Mothers' gonna love ya 'til ya don't know what to do

Nature's been good to this here band
Don't ever think we're shy
Send us up some little groupies and we'll take their hands
And rock 'em till they sweat and cry
What you need is...
Motherly love (Get it now)
Motherly love
Forget about the brotherly and other-ly love
Motherly love is just the thing for you
You know your Mothers' gonna love ya 'til ya don't know what to do

We can love ya 'til ya have a heart attack
You'd best believe that's true
We'll bite your neck and scratch your back
'Til you don't know what to do
What you need is...

Motherly love
Motherly love
Forget about the brotherly and other-ly love
Motherly love is just the thing for you
You know your Mothers' gonna love ya 'til ya don't know what to do

You know I've got a little motherly love for you baby, yeah
You know I've got a little motherly love for you honey, yeah
You know it doesn't bother me at all that you're only eighteen years old 'cause I got a little motherly love for you, babyEmbed
