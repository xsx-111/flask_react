Any Way the Wind Blows Lyrics
Anyway the wind blows is-a fine with me
Anyway the wind blows, it don't matter to me
'Cause I'm through with-a fussin' and-a fightin' with-a you
I went out and found a woman who is gonna be true
She makes me oh so happy, now I'm never ever blue

Anyway the wind blows!
Anyway the wind blows!
Anyway the wind blows!

She is my heart and soul and she loves me tenderly
Now my story can be told, just how good she is to me
Yes, she treats me like she loves me and she never makes me cry
I'm gonna stick with her till the day I die
She's not like you baby, she would never ever lie

Anyway the wind blows!
Anyway the wind blows!
Anyway the wind blows!

Aaah-aah-aah-aah-aaaaah
Aaah-aah-aah-aah-aaaaah
Aaah-aah-aah-aah-aaaaaaaaahh...
Anyway the wind blows!
Anyway the wind blows!
Anyway the wind blows!

Now that I am free from the troubles of the past
Took me much too long to see that our romance couldn't last
I'm gonna go away and leave you standing at the door
I'll tell you pretty baby I won't be back no more
'Cause you don't even know what love is for

Anyway the wind blows!
Anyway the wind blows!
Anyway the wind blows!2Embed
