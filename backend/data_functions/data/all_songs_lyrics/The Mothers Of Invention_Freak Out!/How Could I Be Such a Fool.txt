How Could I Be Such a Fool Lyrics
When I won your love, I was very glad
Every happiness in the world belonged to me
Then our love was lost and you went away
Now I shed my tears in lonely misery

I know now that you never ever really loved me
It hurts me now to think you never ever really cared
I sit and ask myself a thousand times to try and find
What really happened to the love that we shared

How could I be such a fool?
How could I believe all those lies you told me?
How could I be taken in by your sweet face?

You spoiled our love
You ruined my life
I'm so tore down
I'm a terrible disgrace

But there will come a time and you'll regret the way
You treated me as if I was a fool and didn't know
The many times you lied about your love for me
Someone else is gonna know that your love was just a show
How could I be such a fool?Embed
