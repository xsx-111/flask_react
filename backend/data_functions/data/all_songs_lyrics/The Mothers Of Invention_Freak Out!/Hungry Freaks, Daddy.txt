Hungry Freaks, Daddy LyricsMr. America, walk on by
Your schools that do not teach
Mr. America, walk on by
The minds that won't be reached
Mr. America, try to hide
The emptiness that's you inside
But once you find that the way you lied
And all the corny tricks you tried
Will not forestall the rising tide
Of hungry freaks, daddy
They won't go for no more
Great mid-western hardware store
Philosophy that turns away
From those who aren't afraid to say
What's on their minds
The left behinds
Of the Great Society
Hungry freaks, daddy
Mr. America, walk on by
Your supermarket dream
Mr. America, walk on by
The liquor store supreme
Mr. America, try to hide
The product of your savage pride
The useful minds that it denied
The day you shrugged and stepped aside
You saw their clothes and then you cried
"Those hungry freaks, daddy!"
They won't go for no more
Great mid-western hardware store
Philosophy that turns away
From those who aren't afraid to say
What's on their minds
The left behinds
Of the Great Society2Embed
