Who Are the Brain Police? LyricsWhat will you do if we let you go home
And the plastic's all melted
And so is the chrome?
WHO ARE THE BRAIN POLICE?
What will you do when the label comes off
And the plastic's all melted
And the chrome is too soft?
WAAAAHHHHHH!
I think I'm gonna die . 
I think I'm gonna die . 
I think I'm going to die . 
I think I'm going to die . 
I think I'm going to die . 
I think I'm going to die . 
I'm gonna die . 
I think I'm going to die . 
I think I'm gonna die . 
I'm going to die . 
I think I'm gonna die . 
I think I'm gonna die . 
I think I'm gonna die . 
Going to die!
WHO ARE THE BRAIN POLICE?
What will you do if the people you knew
Were the plastic that melted
And the chromium too?
WHO ARE THE BRAIN POLICE?Embed
