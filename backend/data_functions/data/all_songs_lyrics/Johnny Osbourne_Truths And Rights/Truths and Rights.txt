Truths and Rights Lyrics
Render your hearts and not your garments
The truth is there for who have eyes to see
All charity has no place in this judgement
Remember the words of prophecy

Children, run, come the truths and rights
That's what I'm about
You know the truths and rights
Teach it to the children
You know the truths and rights
Teach it to the children
'Cause they should know
Know, know, know, know

Children, say a little prayer
Every night before you go to sleep
'Cause tomorrow is promised to no one
When you think it's peace and safety, Lord
It could be, it could be sudden destruction
'Cause we know, yes, we know

Remember I say these few words to you, oh
Remember the words I'm saying to you right now
And for tomorrow and henceforth I say
Render your hearts and not your garments
The truth is there for who have eyes to see
All charity has no place in this judgement
Just remember the words of prophecy
I said children, run, come the truths and rights
That's what I'm about
You know the truths and rights
Teach it to the children
Run, come the truths and rights
That's what I'm about
You know the truths and rightsEmbed
