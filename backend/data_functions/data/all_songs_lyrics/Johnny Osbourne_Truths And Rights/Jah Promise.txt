Jah Promise Lyrics
Manifestation (Woh-oh-oh, lord)

Just let the truth manifest itself
'Cause‚ man was made out of love
Forever be to your brothers true
'Cause‚ respect is overdue

How could I be unfaithful?
After all the things you have done (Jah Jah)

I ain't gonna break my promise to Jah Jah
I ain't gonna break my promise to him (Never)
I ain't gonna break my promise to Jah Jah
I ain't gonna break my promise no way‚ no way

He gave the moon to brighten up the night
Oh, how the moonlight glow
He gave the stars, they twinkle in the skies
Oh‚ we love the starlight so

But, how could I be unfaithful?
After all the things you have done (Jah Jah)
I ain't gonna break my promise to Jah Jah
I ain't gonna break my promise to him (No way)
I ain't gonna break my promise to Jah
I ain't gonna break my promise to him (No way)

I could never, never break it
'Cause‚ that's the way that I make it

He gave the moon to brighten up the night
Oh, how the moonlight glow
He gave the stars, they twinkle in the skies
Oh, how we love the starlight so

How can I be unfaithful?
After all the things you have done (Jah Jah)

I ain't gonna break my promise to Jah Jah
I ain't gonna break my promise to him (No way)
I ain't gonna break my promise to Jah
I ain't gonna break my promise to him ('Cause, I never-never-never)
I will never, never break it
'Cause, that's the way I make itEmbed
