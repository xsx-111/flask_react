Eternal Peace Lyrics
Tell it to the world, tell it to the people
Searching for eternal peace (Just got to find it)
Calling all the elders to teach it to the children
Searching for eternal peace (Just got to find it)

If we really have united nations (Oh, what a paradise)
(If we could work together) Work together
(And live in harmony) Live in harmony
(Life would be a symphony) Oh, a symphony
Try to help your brothers and never be unkind
Always give a helping hand (Yeah)
Every man a brother, and we really need each other
Living in this troubled time

Tell it to the world
(Tell it to the people) So everyone can understand
(Searching for eternal peace) We just got to find it
Calling all the elders to teach it to the children
Searching for eternal peace
(We just got to find it, we just got to find it)

If we really have united nations (Oh, what a paradise)
(If we could work together) Work together
And live in harmony
(Life would be a symphony)
Oh-oh-oh, what a sweet, sweet symphony
Try to help your brothers and never be unkind
Always give a helping hand (Every man, every man)
Every man a brother, we really need each other
We're living in this troubled time (We just got to do that)
Tell it to the world
Reveal it to the children
