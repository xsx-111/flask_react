Let Me In Lyrics
I'm a knocking at your door
I'm not afraid to knock some more
Oh, lord, I know for sure
You're gonna open up your door
And let me in, good lord, let me in

I'm just a natural man
But I got a righteous plan
I wanna help the needy one
Good lord, you put your hands

Oh, Jahoviah, god and king
Open up your door and let me in

I know what I got to do
I'm gonna do what I've got to do
I'm gonna live my life for you
You better watch all the things you do
You better mind all the things you say
You better live in a Jah Jah righteous way
Little one, do you hear what I say?
Oh, Jahoviah, god and king
Open up your door and let me in

I know that things are gonna get better
I don't have to write you no letter
'Cause I know you're always right beside me
To comfort and guide me

I'm a knocking at your door
I'm not afraid to knock some more
Oh, lord, I know for sure
You're gonna open up your door
You're gonna let me in for sure

Oh, Jahoviah, god and king
Open up your door and let me come in

Oh, Jahoviah, god and king
Open up your door and let me in

I know what I got to do
I'm gonna do what I've got to do
I'm gonna live my life for you
I know the things are gonna get betterEmbed
