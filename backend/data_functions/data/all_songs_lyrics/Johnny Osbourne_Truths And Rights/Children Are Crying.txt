Children Are Crying Lyrics
The children are crying bitter tears
All over the years, all over the years
Mothers are bawling out
Don't know what love is all about
Cross their hearts and they hope to die
Wanna meet their Maker in the sky

One thing I'm asking of you Lord, good Lord
Blessing for the children and prayers for the youth
There got to be a mediator to come forward
And teach the youth the truth
I got to be there at The Levi to bring this message to you

The mothers are crying out
Wondering what life is all about
Some cross their hearts and they hope to die
Wanna meet their Maker in the sky
This is the time of Armageddon
(Armageddon time is now)
But this a revolution of your mind

So watch out, open your eyes and look in your mind
You got to watch your steps as you're going along
War is running out of wars to fight
And peace is achieved if you want it
The children are crying bitter tears
All over the years, all over the years
Mothers are crying out
Wondering what life is all about
Cross their hearts and they hope to die
Wanna meet their Maker in the sky

Open your eyes and open your mind
And learn son, learn
And everything you see the Father do
Ask Him to show you how
Peace is here if you want it
'Cause war is running out of wars to fight

The children are bawling out
Wonder what life is all about
The mothers is crying out
And they don't know what love is all about
Some cross their hearts and they hope to die
Wanna meet their Maker in the sky
Open your mind, open your eyes and see the light
This is the time of Armageddon
Armageddon time is now
Mother, tell me, tell me
Do you know where your children are?
I say mother, mother
Do you know where your children are?Embed
