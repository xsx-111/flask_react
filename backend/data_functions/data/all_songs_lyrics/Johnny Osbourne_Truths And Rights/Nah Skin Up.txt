Nah Skin Up Lyrics
Let's join hand and hearts together
And try to work it out (Don't you see?)

We are all brothers and sisters
So, what are we fighting for?
If love is so lovely and war is so ugly (Lord)
Can't you tell me?
Why must this war be? (Wo-oh-oh-woah)

Mi say, mi can't skin up
We've got to work it out
Solve these problems together

Brother fighting 'gainst brother, father 'gainst son
Lord knows we don't need all these guns
It's not safe to walk the streets anymore
Like we used to do before (And that is why)

Stop skin-skin up, I say
We've got to work it out
Can't find no love this way
We got to solve our problem together (Woh-yeah)
In this crucial time that we live in, I say
What is the judgement for the sin?
If love is so lovely then war is so ugly (Lord)
Can't you tell me?
Why must this war be?

I say a that I can't skin up
Nah skin up
Can't skin up, I say

We got to get together and put out the problem
In a righteous way
Just can't skin up, I say
Got to be serious, in this crucial time
Oh, lord

Can't skin up, I tell you nah skin up
Just can't skin up, nah skin up
We got to get together
And try to solve the problem

I just can't skin up, I can't do that
I got to be serious, lord, I say
In this crucial timeEmbed
