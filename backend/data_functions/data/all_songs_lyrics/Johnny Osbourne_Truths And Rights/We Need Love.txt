We Need Love Lyrics
Wo-ho-ho, la-la-la

When I was a young boy
We used to go to church every Sunday (Oh)

There was handclapping, foot-stomping music
We used to dance in the name of the lord
And now I grow older
Somewhere on the road of life
I wanna sing a song to him
If the whole world could be wrapped up in love
What a beautiful feeling
Such heavenly bliss (Oh, lord)
And the clouds that pierce the sunset (Oh, lord)
Oh, what a beautiful feeling
If the whole wide world could join in and sing

You need love (Don't you?)
People need love (Don’t we?)
We all need love (Don't you?)
Mama need love (Me too)
Papa need love (Me too)
Love, love is a crazy feeling
Of happiness again

'Cause, living in a world without love
Or handclapping, foot-stomping music
For us to get together every now an’ then
Sing a song of love for the children to learn (Wo-ho-ho, la-la-la)
Oh, what a beautiful feeling
If the whole world could join in and sing
Never mind who wants to do their own thing
If we could be like that every time
We could never solve our problems together
But, remember one thing
As a nation and a people that is unified (Remember)

You need love, don't you?
We all need love, don't we?
The children need love, don't we?
The whole world need love, don't we?Embed
