Sing-Jay Stylee Lyrics
Action, to the morning chant
I say, no bother 
Musical sound lead the way
From Kingston to Montego Bay
So, I beg you
Keep on ride all day (Say)

What's your plan, mister music man?
Say, what's your plan, mister music man?
Mi have rub-a-dub an' mi have soul one
We play for natty dread an' we play for soul man
We play sweet music to please everyone

Because, you love all mi music
Mi say, you love all mi music

What kind of style are you really gonna play?
Say, what kind of style are you really gonna play?

Rub-a-dub stylee (Lee-lee, a lee-lee-lee-lee)
Say, rub-a-dub stylee (Lee-lee, a lee-lee-lee-lee)
A dis a singjay stylee
A dis a singjay stylee
I beg a girl a dance an' this is what she do
She looked at me from my head to my toe
She look at my pants an' she look at my shoes

She say "I can't dance with you"
She say "I can't dance with you"

Walking down di road I meet the shoe shine boy
I say, a really have fi shine my shoe
Walking down di road I meet the shoe shine boy
I said, a really have fi shine my shoe

I beg another dance and I started to dance
In the middle of the dance this is what she said to me

"Mister, do you wanna stop this dance?"
We just a make a romance in a dance
We just a make a romance in a dance
You see me done trying
A mi no drink up no 
She say, "Johnny, you are really fi we star"
She say, "Johnny, you are really fi we star"
She say, mi lyrics well crucial
Mi even sing christmas choir

Mi check sister Pearl an' she take me 'round the world
She take me 'round di world in a one night tour
London, Munich, New York, ParisEmbed
