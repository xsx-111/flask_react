Wicked World LyricsWe have sinned so many times before
We see no need to turn back now
We're the world, the wicked world
Marching to hell
We know what we're doing
We're marching to hell
Come and join us have some fun
Dance in joy beneath the neon light
We're the world, the wicked world
Marching to hell
We know what we're doing
We're marching to hell
We're the world the wicked world
We do whatever we please
Forget your cares, sow your wild oats
Sin is a wonderful disease
Lie and steal, it's alright
We have no worry for tomorrow
'cause
We're the world, the wicked world
Marching to hell
We know what we're doing
We're marching to hell
We're the world, the wicked world
We don't believe in God
We don't believe in anything
We find that idea to be rather odd
We pain ourselves as our bodies start to decay
We're getting closer every day
We have sinned so many times before
We see no need to turn back now
'cause
We're the world, the wicked world
Marching to hell
We know what we're doing
We're marching to hell
We know what we're doing, we're marching to hell
Hupt' two three four
