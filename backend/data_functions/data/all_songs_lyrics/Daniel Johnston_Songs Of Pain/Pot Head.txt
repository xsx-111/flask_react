Pot Head LyricsMan you look like old man’s eyes
When I saw you in that room
And now you’re on tour
They booked you in the asylum
You work so hard at being a buffoon
And now you ain’t got no incentive left
You popped your own balloon
You wanted to be somebody
But you ain’t nobody
You ain’t got no body
You’re just a head
You’re just a pothead
I heard one day they said you got so high
You ate up a chicken head and it was still alive
I have some friends who swear you did so don’t deny
Some day you’re gonna get so messed up
You’ll eat the head off your kid
And won’t you be sorry, pothead…
You brag to all your friends
About the fun you had last night
I wonder if you realize you forgot to brush your teeth
And then you’ll come a-bummin’
Asking for some money
You even tried to roll the sacred pages
And you burnt your lip
That lip is has a trench in it
Where that wild weed sits
Sucking like a parasite
Of any sense you might have left
You say that you are happy
And you like stormy weather
Well I think that you’re just dumb
And you don’t know any better
You play your rock and roll guitar
You say you’re gonna be a big star
But everyone in this neighborhood
Knows just who you are
No I ain’t tryin’ to be hard
I don’t mean to be cruel
I’m just tryin’ to say something that’ll shock…
You into going back… to school
Or maybe at least reality
In this year (Pothead)
You wanted to be somebody
But you ain’t nobody
You ain’t got no body
You’re just a headEmbed
