Wild West Virginia LyricsI'm goin' back to the place that I used to call home
I'm goin' back to the place where the antelope never roam
Wild West Virginia
Home of the naive
This boy'd be mighty pleased to see them rollin' hills, rollin' hills
No I don't like John Denver
But I always will remember those rollin' hills
I got a backwoods woman, underprivileged mama, farmer in the dell
Crooked politicians, crater bomb roads
But oh I love it so
Those rollin' hills
Wild West Virginia
Rollin' hills
Wild West Virginia)
Get to shiverin' by the Ohio River in the cold winter
When a snowflake falls on your face you feel just like an iceberg
But I wouldn't trade it for this sticky hot weather in Texas
I'm gonna make an exodus to them rollin' hills
Wild West Virginia
Rollin' hills
Wild West Virginia
I get this wheelin' feelin'
Singin' like Slim Whitman "Oh how I wanna go home"
Away from them big city slickers
Skinny intellectuals and them tall buildin's
Back to wild West Virginia
Home of the naive
This boy'd be mighty pleased to see them rollin' hills
Wild West Virginia
Rollin' hills
God is an artist
And He painted a pretty picture
And He called it West Virginia
With those rollin' hills, rollin' hills, rollin' hills
Wild West Virginia
Wild West Virginia
