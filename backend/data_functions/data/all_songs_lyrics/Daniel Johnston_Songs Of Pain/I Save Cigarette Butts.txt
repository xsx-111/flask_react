I Save Cigarette Butts LyricsI save cigarette butts for a poor girl
Across town
We were making marriage plans
And some guy came over and took her to
A wrestling match
Later that evening Frankenstein
And the beauty queen sat thumbing through
A Better Homes and Gardens magazine
Making plans and holding hands
Along came a spider, sat down beside her
And took her to
A wrestling match
I had this dream about these angels
I had this dream the other night
It was really weird
They were playing guitars
And getting loud
And they spilt beer on Jesus
I save cigarette butts for a poor girl
Across town
I spent a lot of money at the pizza shop
Just to watch the waitresses walk
Back and forth
I go to school, I'm a college student
I have a secret pocket on the inside of my coat
Where I keep this cigarette butt
Meanwhile on the dance floor
The loud guitar solo seems to be promoting wild desires
The music has set their hearts on fire with lust
Sure are a lot of cigarette butts layin' around
I thought I'd give her one more chance
So I went over to see her again at her house
And when I walked in
There was her and him
And they were having a wrestling match
I save cigarette butts for a poor girl
Across townEmbed
