A Little Story LyricsThere was this big guy
And He had a great idea
He built himself a world
And He'd put people on it
But the people they turned wicked
And they soon forgot
Who had made their very being
And put them on their planet
So the God He sent His very own Son
His only holy Son
And He sent him to the world
Cause something had to be done
His son walked around and he told the truth
Like the truth had never been told
He was kind to the poor
His home was the road
Unlike any other heroes
Of which a song could be sung
He never did bad to anyone
He never did no harm
But there were other people who weren't so nice
And they plotted to take his life
And the man knew all about it
But he didn't even hide
And they beat him and they robbed him
And they hung him for being good
And they laughed and made jokes
While they stood in his blood
But there's a happy ending to the story
I think you'll be glad to know
He came back to life in glory
And up from the grave he arose
So before you turn out your light
Remember this one man
Who lived comfortably in Heaven
But gave it all up to hang on a cross
Because he hung for you and me
And he came to set us free
Cause his dad had a great idea
About the way things ought to beEmbed
