Joy Without Pleasure Lyrics
When I was a little kid
And all the people they looked big
I never exactly understood
How to tell the trees from the wood

Joy without Pleasure
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all
Joy without Pleasure
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all

My Mama she took me aside one day
She said you better have fun while you play
'Cause someday you'll wake up and you'll be old
And all of your youth will be gone away
And you work in a factory and you earn your pay
And your fingers will rot and your mind will decay
You'll be happy, so happy with your family and house
But you'll never, you'll never enjoy yourself

Joy without Pleasure
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all
Joy without Pleasure
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all
The Son of Charles Dickens had a little red hen
Danced the watusi like it was a sin
They tried to enjoy it but they feel so guilty
Guilt won't allow you to enjoy a stolen apple

Joy without Pleasure
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all
Joy without Pleasure
Ain't no fun, ain't no fun at all

That song is about Premarital SexEmbed
