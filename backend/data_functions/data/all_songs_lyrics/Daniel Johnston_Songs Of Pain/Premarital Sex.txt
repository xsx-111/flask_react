Premarital Sex LyricsFirst you say you will
Then you say you won’t
Then you say you’re waiting for that special someone
You'll wed someday
It’s guilty temptation
Adolescent lust
Now you’ve got more than just pimples popping out
First you say that you will
But you know you won’t
But you gotta get your thrills
Don’t look at me
Go ahead and take the pill
Premarital sex
At the place that I work
The guys are always talking
About sexual delights
Pleasures of the flesh
You can get it plenty
You can get it nice
You can get it anywhere at anytime
If you pay the price
First, you say that you will
But you know you won’t
But you gotta get your thrill
Don’t look at me
Go ahead and take the pill
