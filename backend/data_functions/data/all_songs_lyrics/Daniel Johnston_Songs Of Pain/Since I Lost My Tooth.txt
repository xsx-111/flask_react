I've been up and I been down
When I been between I just been hangin' around
Things are quite different
And life ain't the same
Since I lost my tooth
Now the women they treat me rude
Not that they ever really treated me that good
I'm a minority and now I know
What it's like and how it feels to be a negro
Doo doo doo doo
It's gettin' down to the nitty gritty
If you can't smile nice and you can't smile pretty
They don't wantchya around they say you look sloppy
When you eat
Well
I've been up and I been down
When I been between I just been hangin' around
Things are quite different
And life ain't the same
Since I lost my toothEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
