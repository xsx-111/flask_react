Urge LyricsGet attached to a rolling stone
And you're liable to get crushed
You're better off to sit at home
And watch the toilet flush
I like to sit and look at her
I like to do that so much
To stand and act mysterious
And to watch her blush
I know I'm such a weird guy
She could never take me serious
There's always that green monkey
In around or near us
I think sometimes of holdin' her
But the picture gets all blurred
I see shadows dancin' on my wall
Thoughts scatter like birds
I wish to God i could touch her hand
Somehow make her understand
The man I somehow wanna be
The man I want her to make me
But she stands so distant and rolls her eyes
She leaves me and I don't know why
Nothing seems to make much sense
I can't appreciate the sky
And so I go home lonely
Like a wolf without a pack
I got nothin to put my love in
Like groceries without a sack
Maybe someday when she gets fat
She'll think about what she's missed
She'll know she'll never get me back
She'll feel just like the pits
She'll sit lonely in her apartment
Thinkin' about what might have been
She'll know her man had come and went
Maybe she'll take me seriously then
Get attached to a rolling stone
And you're liable to get crushed
You're better off to sit at home
And watch the toilet flush1Embed
