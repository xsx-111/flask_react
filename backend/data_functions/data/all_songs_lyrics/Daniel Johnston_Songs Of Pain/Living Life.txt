Living Life Lyrics
Hold me like a mother would
Like I always knew
Somebody should
Though tomorrow
It don't look that good
Well, it just goes to show
Though people say we're an
Unlikely couple
I'm seeing double
Of you

Oh
This is life
And everything's all right
Living living living living living living living living life

Oh
Hope for the hopeless
I'm learning to cope
With the emotionless mediocricy of
Day-to-day living
How can I help but be restless
When everything seems so tasteless
And all of the colors
Seem to have
Faded away
Oh, this is life
This is life
And everything's all right
Living living living living living living living living life

Hold me like a mother would
Like I've always known
That somebody should, yeah
Although tomorrow
It don't look that good
Well, it just goes to show
Though people say we're an
Unlikely couple
