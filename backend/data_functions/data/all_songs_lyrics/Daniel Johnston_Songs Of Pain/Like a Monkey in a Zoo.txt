Like a Monkey in a Zoo LyricsI'm chained to the wall
I'm nothing at all
And my eyes look into the sunset thinking of better things to do
Like a monkey in a zoo
The days go so slow
I don't have no friends
Except all these people who want me to do tricks for them
Like a monkey in a zoo
And it could happen to you
You could be in my place
No it wasn't always like this
Oh but I never saw it coming
I'm so alone
But this is my home
And the bars that surround me keep me from knowing any better
Like a monkey in a zoo
Throw me a peanut
Laugh and make jokes
But I've had enough peanuts and i'm ready to croak
Like a monkey in a zoo
You come to look at me
You seem so amused
But things would look different
If you were in my shoes
I know it's my fault
But I want out
And when I cry out nobody seems to understand
Like a monkey in a zoo
You say I'm cute
You don't know how much that hurts
You don't know how it feels to live in your own dirt
Like a monkey in a zoo
And it could happen to you
You could be in my place
Don't let yourself slip
Don't keep egg on your face
I used to be happy
I can't remember those days
But I sold my freedom for free room and board
