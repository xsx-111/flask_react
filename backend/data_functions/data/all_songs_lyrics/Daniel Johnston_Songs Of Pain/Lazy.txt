Lazy LyricsWell I made some mistakes but
I ain't learned a lesson
That I don't wanna hear about responsibilities
I got less important things to do
I'm lazy - Oh yeah
Lost hopes and dreams down an empty road
See no tomorrow
But I got love for you girl
I'm just too lazy to give it to you
I'm lazy - Oh yeah
Well I quit college and I quit my job
I think I'll quit life
Yeah I'm gonna quit again
I think I'll quit one last time
I'm a quitter - Oh yeah
Quit this, quit that, quit everything
I quit everything I ever began
Quit that, quit this, quit everything
I never finished anything I ever started
But I think I'm gonna quit being a quitter1Embed
