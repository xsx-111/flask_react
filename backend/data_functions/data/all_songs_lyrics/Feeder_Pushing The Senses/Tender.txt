Tender LyricsAche, can't watch you break and shatter
Saved, new lives to make us better
I'm letting you know, cleansing my soul
Been letting you know, for days ...
Turn over everything
Time can heal us again
I'm tender in your arms
Reaching inside of me
Bringing the love I need
The loneliness has gone
Faith, new roads to take together
Days, lying awake, remember
I'm letting you know, cleansing my soul
Been letting you know, for days ...
Turn over everything
Time can heal us again
I'm tender in your arms
Reaching inside of me
Bringing the love I need
The loneliness has gone
I'm letting you know, cleansing my soul
Been letting you know, for days ...
Turn over everything
Time can heal us again
I'm tender in your arms
Reaching inside of me
Bringing the love I need
The loneliness has gone ...
The loneliness has goneEmbed
