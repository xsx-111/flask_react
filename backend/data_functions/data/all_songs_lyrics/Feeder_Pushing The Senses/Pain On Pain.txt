Pain On Pain LyricsStay for life, for life
All you discover
Stay for life, for life
This moment together
To heal yourself, love can heal
Can't watch you fall
Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away
Save yourself, yourself
Lost for a second
Save yourself, yourself
Bury the concious
And heal yourself, you can heal
Can't watch you fall
Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away
Pain on pain
Pain (x4)
Yeah
Wait for love, for love
You know it can happen
Wait for love, for love
The touch of a hand, to heal yourself
You can heal, can't watch you fall
Pain on pain
Don't come back here again
Shame on pain
Took the last breath away
Pain on painEmbed
