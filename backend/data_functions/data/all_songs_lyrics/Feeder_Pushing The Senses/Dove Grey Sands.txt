Dove Grey Sands LyricsSeeing life begin, hear the oceans sing
It takes you back, pulls you back, brings you home
See a face in stone, a hollow moon above an aching sky
Silent night, brings you home
Left without a place, lonely inner space
That you can breathe
It's the essence of our love, my love ...
Led by devotion, celebrate, celebrate, celebration
Dove grey sands
Led by devotion, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate now
Dove grey sands
Narrow days alone, wishing for the sun
Don't hide away, burn to grey, warm the soul
Facing life alone, numbers on a phone
To help you back, send it back, bring you home
Left without a place, lonely inner space
That you can't breathe
It's the essence of a love, my love ...
Led by devotion, celebrate, celebrate, celebration
Dove grey sands
Led by devotion, celebrate, celebrate, celebrate now
Dove grey sands
Feeling like it's over, it's just the start
I can't hear you again
Dreaming of the ocean, as waves come in
I can't hear it again
