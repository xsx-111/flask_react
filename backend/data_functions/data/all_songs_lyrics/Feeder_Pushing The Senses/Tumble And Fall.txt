Tumble And Fall LyricsAll this for nothing
Yeah yeah yeah
Praying and hoping
Fooling yourself...
You know that you can
Give love a reason
Give love a chance
We tumble and fall
Together we crawl
Forever will be
Tumble and fall
Heaven's above us
Yeah yeah yeah
Living in solace
I'd give you it all...
Just for a day
Just for a second
Just for the way...
We tumble and fall
Together we crawl
Forever will be
Tumble and fall
Life's not the same
Since that day you went away
I recall, like the drops of summer rain
That fell on me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
We tumble and fall
Together we crawl
Forever will be
Tumble and fall
Together we crawl
Forever will be
Tumble and fall
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeahEmbed
