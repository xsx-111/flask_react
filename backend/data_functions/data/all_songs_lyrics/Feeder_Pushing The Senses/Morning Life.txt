Morning Life LyricsA new day has begun
And taken us now
Morning life is here
Touch, sight and sound
But you feel, nothing is real
You're flesh and bone, but nothing is real
Today, this could be the only day
Can't let this moment get away
'cause this could be the only way
So call on me, call on me...
Tempers of the world
Dragging you down
The chemistry of life
The touch of a hand
But you feel, nothing is real
You're flesh and bone, but nothing is real
Today, this could be the only day
Can't let this moment get away
'cause this could be the only day
So call on me, call on me
You're fading out, don't fade, you're coming back
You're fading now, don't fade, you're coming back
You're fading out don't fade
You're coming back
Today, 'cause this could be the only way
So call on me, call on me...
Today, this could be the only day
Can't let this moment get away...Embed
