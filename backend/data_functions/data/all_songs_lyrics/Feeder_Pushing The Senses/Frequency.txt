Frequency LyricsCome on in, I hear your voice
Change the frequency, and make that choice
Constitution, find new ground
You've got to know
I think about you every day
You're lying awake on top of silver clouds
Sending Love back down
It's real love (x3)
Can't you feel it? Can't you breathe it in?
Come on in, I hear you sing
Born together, different skin
Superstition, prophecy
You've gotta know
I think about you every day
You're lying awake on top of silver clouds
You're sending love back down
It's real love (x3)
Can't you feel it? Can't you breathe it in?
Real love (x6)Embed
