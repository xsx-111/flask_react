Bitter Glass LyricsThe thought of never knowing
Would kill me just the same
A solitary blossom
Reminders of a friend
What are you saying
You've got nothing to live for
You're tired and you're broken
You just can't free yourself
And all the words we've spoken
And buried in the sand
The raptured and the broken
That taste of bitter glass
What are you saying
You've got nothing to live for
You're tired and you're broken
You just can't free yourself
What are you saying
It's just the thought of rejection
It's pulling you deeper
You just can't free yourself
Your voluntary loving
Apologies have passed
And come around again
The fragments of a reason
The taste of bitter glass
So what are you saying
You've got nothing to live for
You're tired and you're broken
You just can't free yourself
What are you saying
It's just a part of rejection
It's pulling you deeper
You just can't be yourselfEmbed
