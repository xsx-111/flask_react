Pushing The Senses LyricsFeelings you never knew
Pulling you under now
Your fighting the undertow
Before it sucks you down
Pushing the senses
It's pushing the senses now
Come on come on what are you going to do
You can't find another day
Come on come on you're pushing the senses
You're pushing the senses through ...
Always, I can depend on you
But sometimes, it's burning a hole right through
Let's talk about it ...
Staring at photographs
Posted on the wall
Images smiling down
The face of a lonely soul
Come on come on, what are you going to do
You can't find another day
Come on come on you're pushing the senses
You're pushing the senses through ...
Always 'cause I can depend on you
But sometimes, I'm finding it hard to choose
Let's talk about it ...
Always I can depend on you
Sometimes, It's burning a hole right through
Let's talk about it ... (x2)
Always, I can depend on you
But sometimes, sometimes ...
Always, I can depend on you
But sometimes, It's burning a hole right through
Let's talk about it ...
Always, I can depend on you
But sometimes, It's burning a hole right through
Keep pushing the senses through
Let's talk about us ...Embed
