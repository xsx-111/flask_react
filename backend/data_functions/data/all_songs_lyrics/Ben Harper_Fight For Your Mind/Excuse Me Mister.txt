Excuse Me Mister LyricsExcuse me Mr, do you have the time?
Or are you so important that it stands still for you?
Excuse me Mr, won't you lend me your ears?
Or are you not only blind but do you not hear?
Excuse me Mr but isn't that your oil in the sea?
And the pollution in the air Mr, who's could that be?
So excuse me Mr, but I'm a Mr too
And you're giving Mr a bad name, Mr like you
So I'm taking the Mr from out in front of your name
Cuz it's the Mr like you that puts the rest of us to shame
It's the Mr like you that puts the rest of us to shame
And I, I've seen enough
I've seen enough to know
That I've seen too much
Excuse me Mr can't you see the children dying?
You say that you can help them Mr your not even trying
Excuse me Mr, just take a look around
Oh Mr, just look up and you will, you will see it coming down
Excuse me Mr but I'm a, I'm a Mr too
Your giving Mr a bad name, Mr like you
So I'm taking the Mr from out in front of your name
Cuz it's the Mr like you that puts the rest of us to shame
It's the Mr like you putting the rest of us to shame
And I, I've seen enough, I've seen and I've seen and
I've seen enough to know that I've seen too much
I've seen enough, I have seen enough to know, that I have seen too much
See cuz Mr when you're rattling on heaven's gate
By then it's too late
Cuz Mr when you get there they don't ask they don't ask
What you saved
All they wanna know, Mr is what you gave
So excuse me Mr, but I'm a Mr too
And you're giving Mr a bad name Mr like you
So I'm taking the Mr from out in front of you're name
Cuz it's the Mr, Mr like you that puts the rest of us to shame
It's the Mr like you that puts the rest of us to shameEmbed
