Give a Man a Home LyricsHave you ever lost your way
Have you ever feared another day
Have you ever misplaced your whole mind
Watching this world leavin' you behind
Won't you
Won't you give
Won't you give a man
Give a man a home
Have you ever worn thin
Have you ever never known where to begin
Have you ever lost your belief
Watching your faith turn to grief
Won't you
Won't you give
Won't you give a man
Give a man a home
In a world that is unwhole
You have got to fight just to keep your soul
Some would rather give than receive
Some would rather give up before they belive
Won't you
Won't you give
Won't you give a man
Give a man a homeEmbed
