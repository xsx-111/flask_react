People Lead LyricsPeople Lead
When the people lead
The leaders they will have to follow
And all their lies and their alibies
They will have to swallow
And it's you that has the authority
For the one who is right
Is the majority
When the people lead
People take the lead
Children you've got to take your lead
Or you shall be led astray
So as long as someone else
Controls your history
The truth shall remain just a mystery
For you can lead a horse to the water
But you cannot make him drink
You can put a man through school
But you cannot make him think
When the people lead
People take the lead
Children you've got to take your lead
Or you shall be led astray
Watch them try to hide
This world's imposition
But like disease that has come round from remission
When it seems
As if it has left your person
All the while it has only worsened
When the people lead
People take the lead
Children you've got to take your lead
Or you shall be led astrayEmbed
