By My Side LyricsDon't you get ahead of me
And I won't leave you behind
If you get unhappy
Won't you show me a sign
There's no love like lost love
No pain like a broken heart
There's no love like you and me
And no loss like us apart
Promises, promise is
Only a word
And when softly spoken
Is never heard
And a heart
Is not a stone
And is fragile, is fragile
When alone
By my side
By my side
Won't you be by my side
By my side
By my side
Won't you be by my side
My care for you
Is from the ground up to the sky
It's over under up above
Down below and to the side
There's no use in pretending
No use in saving face
For my love is never ending
And you are my saving grace
By my side
By my side
Won't you be by my side
By my side
By my side
Won't you be by my sideEmbed
