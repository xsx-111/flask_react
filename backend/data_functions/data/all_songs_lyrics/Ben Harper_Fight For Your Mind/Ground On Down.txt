Ground On Down LyricsI believe in a few things
God, the devil and love
But I looked from the bottom
And I've stared down from above
And I have faith in a few things
Divinity and grace
But even when I'm on my knees
I know the devil prays
And you're workin' your way
From the ground on down
I hate to say I love you
Because it means that I will be
With your forever
Or we'll sadly say goodbye
And I love to say I hate you
Because it means that I will live
My life happily without ya
Or we'll sadly live a lie
And you're working your way
From the ground on down
On down
Your way from the ground on down
On... (check it out)
Life is short and if you're looking for extension
With your time you had best do well
Cause there's good deeds
And there's good intention
They're as far apart as heaven and hell
I said you're working your way
From the ground on downEmbed
