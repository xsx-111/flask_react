Oppression LyricsOppression, you pray on us when we sleep
Oppression, you chase after the tired, the poor, the weak
Oppression, you know you mean only harm
Opression, you reach out with your long arm
But Oppression, I won't let you near me, oh no
Opression, you shall learn to fear me, yes you will
Oppression, you seek population control
Oppression, to divide and to conquer is your goal
Oppression, I swear that hatred is your home
Oppression, you just won't leave bad enough alone
But Oppression, I won't let you near me, oh no
Oppression, you shall learn to fear me, yes you will
Oppression, I don't see how you sleep
Oppression, for your bleeding conscience I weep
Oppression, you may have the dollar on your side
But Oppression, from the gospel truth you cannot hide
And Oppression, I won't let you near me, oh no
Oppression, you shall learn to fear me, yes you will
Oppression, I won't let you near me, ohhh
Oppression, you shall fear me yes---- you-- wi-----llahEmbed
