Fight for Your Mind LyricsIf your gonna live, then live it up
And if your gonna give, then give it up
If your gonna walk the earth, better walk it proud
And if your gonna say the word, you got to say it loud
Said you got to fight fight fight for your mind
While you got the time
You got fight fight fight for your mind
If your gonna build a house, make it a home
If your gonna pull some weight, pull your own
If your gonna help, then just reach out your hand
And if your getting up, then take a stand
Said you got to fight fight fight for your mind
While you got the time
You got fight fight fight for your mind
If your gonna step then step on in
And if your gonna finish ya got to begin
Don't you fear what you don't know
Just let that be your room to grow
Said you got to fight fight fight for your mind
While you got the time
You got fight fight fight for your mindEmbed
