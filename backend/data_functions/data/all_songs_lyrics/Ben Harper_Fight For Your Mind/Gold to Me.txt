Gold to Me LyricsYou look like gold to me
And I'm not too blind to see
Ah, you look like gold
Said you look like gold
And you make me want to sing
With all the joy you bring
Ah, you look like gold
Ah, you look like gold
Like the rays down from the sun
When a new day has just begun
You look like gold
You look like gold
Now looka here
Cause I've been fooled before
But now I know
I made the mistake in the past
But now I, now I know the difference
From gold, from gold and brass
Its not the kind of gold that you wear
But that kind that can feel my care
Ah hey, you look like gold
Ah, Now you look like gold
Some shine when the day is new
Ah, but they fade when the day is through
But not you, you look like gold
I said you look like gold
Ah, but I been wrong before
But now I know
I made mistakes in the past
But now, but now I know, now I know
Now I know, now I know
The difference from gold and brass
You look like gold to me
And I'm, I'm down on a bended knee
Ah, you look like gold
Oh, you look like gold
I just, I just want you to know
To me you mean so, so, so much more
Than all the gold
Ah, you look like gold
Uh, you shine like gold
Said you look like goldEmbed
