Please Me Like You Want To LyricsDon't do me any favors
Matter of fact why don't you do yourself a few
Your presence, it ain't nobody's blessing
I've got plenty of other things that I could do
Oh no, not another excuse
Your tired silly games
For me are just no use
And now it's plain for me to see
You're with somebody
That you don't want to be
So won't you
Please please me like you want to
Not like you have to
Or won't you just go on and leave me
You know leaving me is the least that you could do
You know leaving me is the least that you could do
You could have spared me so much misery
And told me you just wanted a friend
Believe me there is a difference
When you mean it
And when you pretend
Or was I just your habit
'Cause I know a habit is a hard thing to break
But won't you spare me, a little mercy
There's only so much that I can take
So won't you
Please please me like you want to
Not like you have to
Or won't you just go on and leave me
You know leaving me is the least that you could do
Leaving me is the least that you could do
I said leaving me is the least that you could do1Embed
