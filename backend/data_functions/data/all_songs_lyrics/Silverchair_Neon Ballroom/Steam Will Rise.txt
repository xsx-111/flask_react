Steam Will Rise Lyrics
Contain yourself, I will compress
What I am too
Replace yourself with what you have
Your substitute

Only wanted a piece of myself

Steam will rise
Esteem will rise
Steam will rise
Esteem will rise

Refrain, confess, contain, repress
Pretend I'm dead
Abuse myself, confuse myself
I won't be led

Only wanted a piece of myself
Only wanted a piece of myself
Only wanted a piece of myself
Steam will rise
Esteem will rise
Steam will rise
Esteem will rise


Steam will rise
Esteem will rise
Steam will rise
Esteem will riseEmbed
