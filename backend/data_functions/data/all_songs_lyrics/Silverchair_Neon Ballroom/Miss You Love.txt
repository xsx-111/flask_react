Miss You Love Lyrics
Millionaire say, got a big shot deal?
Iâ€™ve thrown it all away, but
But I'm not too sure how I'm supposed to feel
Or what I'm supposed to say, but

I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle everyday

And I miss you, love

Make room for the prey
'Cause I'm coming in with what I want to say, but
It's gonna hurt
And I love the pain
A breeding ground for hate, but

I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people
Remember today
I've no respect for you

And I miss you, love
And I miss you, love

I love the way you love
But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back
And it's just a fad part of the teen, teenage angst brigade, and

I'm not, not sure
Not too sure how it feels
To handle every day
Like the one that just passed
In the crowds of all the people

Remember today
I've no respect for you

And I miss you, love
And I miss you, love
Remember today
I've no respect for you

And I miss you, love
And I miss you

I love the way you love
But I hate the way I'm supposed to love you back2Embed
