Satin Sheets Lyrics
Just wait for us to say it
And we'll make you lie
And anyone who cares
Lies on satin sheets

And I waste my time on no one
And you think I really care

Wears a saturn bracelet
Lined with cocaine coins
No chance slipped away
Toddler training toys

And I waste my time on no one
And you think I really care


And I waste my time on no one
And you think I really careEmbed
