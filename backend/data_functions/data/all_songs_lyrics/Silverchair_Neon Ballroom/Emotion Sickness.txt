Emotion Sickness Lyrics
Erupt again, ignore the pill
And I won't let it show
Sacrifice the torture
Orchestral tear cashflow

Increase, delete, escape, defeat
It's all that matters to you
Cotton case for an iron pill

Distorted eyes
When everything is clearly dying

Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and

Emotion sickness
Addict with no heroine
Emotion sickness

Distorted eyes
When everything is clearly dying

Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and pray
Burn my knees and
Burn my knees and pray

Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Get up
Won't you stop my pain


Emotion sickness
Addict with no heroin
Good things will pass (it helps with excess access)
