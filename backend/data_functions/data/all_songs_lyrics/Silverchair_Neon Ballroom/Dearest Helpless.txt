Dearest Helpless Lyrics
Dearest helpless, intent's not as bad as the action
Take a breath to distort the fear in your eyes
I don't mean it to hurt
But everytime I hate you, I think of you first

He's made you blind
You're better on your own
I'm just that kind to bring you down

Equalise the pressure it's all too much
Sex, drugs and image is just enough
To get you by in the real world

He's made you blind
You're better on your own
I'm just that kind to bring you down


He's made you blind
I'm just that kind
To bring you, to bring you
He's made you blind
You're better on your own
I'm just that kind
To bring you down1Embed
