Paint Pastel Princess Lyrics
It's only self-rejection
With a mean left
Cold carbon copied coping
And it's mean theft
That's been left behind

Paint pastel princess
Bo and arapax
The shelves when they're broken
I'll beg you, beg you

Waste life when youth is sweeter, neater
Content with contents
Cultures cringing at accents
And it's too tense, camp out
She tastes the candy
Sugarless, cancerous
Crave cocaine cop shows
I'll beg you, beg you

But it's all the same to me
But it's all the same to me
But it's all the same to me
But it's all the same to me

But it's all the same to me
But it's all the same to me
But it's all the same to me
But it's all the same to me

Paint pastel princess
Bo and arapax
The shelves when they're broken
I'll beg you, beg you2Embed
