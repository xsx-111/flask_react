Point Of View Lyrics
Liberate the people that you hate
Then cut yourself again
Elevate then drop back down
And see which ones remain

Remember all that she can say
Is that she knows she wants it

You'll make it through
With another point of view again
You'll make it through
With another point

Accusation, does yes mean no
Or have you changed your mind
Kill the nation before it grows
And be one of a kind

Remember all that she can say
Is that she knows she wants it
You'll make it through
With another point of view again
You'll make it through
With another point

Pretend the world's an ocean
Oh, I'm drowning
Pretend that I'm pollution
Oh, I'm dying
Pretend the steak's a cowboy
And the kiss will kill you

You'll make it through
With another point of view again
You'll make it through
With another pointEmbed
