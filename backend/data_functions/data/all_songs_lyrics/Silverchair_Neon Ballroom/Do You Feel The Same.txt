Do You Feel The Same Lyrics
The moon covered, determined to find
To find my place of hiding
Try to detach, try to decrease
To make it easier on me
Despise myself for what you've done
Sent me back into my world
Hold yourself, 'cause no one will
I'll make it easier

Now I have managed to be the one
To be the victim without the gun

Do you feel the same anyway
Now you've come
Do you feel the same anyway
Now you've come

Stay alert, 'cause I'm obsessed
Surely I can't be depressed
Could I be read if I was see-through
Or would you just read my spine?
Would I be read if I was see-through?
Could I be read if I was see-through?
Would I be read if I was see-through
Or would you just read my spine?

Now I have managed to be the one
To be the victim without the gun

Do you feel the same anyway
Now you've come
Do you feel the same anyway
Now you've come
Do you feel the same, feel the same
Now you've come
Do you feel the same anyway

Hold yourself, 'cause no one will
I'l be there to take the spill
Cleanse your soul, change the tide
And ride the wave back into me

Be the one
Without the gun

Do you feel the same anyway
Now you've come
Do you feel the same anyway
Now you've come
Do you feel the same, feel the same
Now you've come
Do you feel the same anyway
Now you've comeEmbed
