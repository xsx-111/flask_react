Sean Flynn Lyrics
You know he heard the drums of war
When the past was a closing door
The drums beat into the jungle floor
The past was always a closing door
Closing door

Rain on the leaves and soldiers sing
You never never hear anything
They filled the sky with a tropical storm
You know he heard the drums of war
Each man knows what he's looking forEmbed
