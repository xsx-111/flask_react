Car Jamming Lyrics
Tonight they're closing up the world
And sweepin' smoke from cigarette
And what is that funky multi-national
Anthem rocking from a thousand
King Kong cassette decks
Then a shy-boy from Missouri
Boots blown off in a '60s war
Riding aluminum crutches
Now he knows the welfare kindness
Agent Orange colour blindness
As we works from door to door
The violence in the carpets
The error of his wife
Drives the slum-bum dweller
To grind his hunting knife
In homesteads of cigar box
The radios hive like bees
The body in the ice box has no date for freeze

In a car jam

Selling is what selling sells
But only saints on the seven avenues
Can sell the seven hells
Fanning out the drug afflicted leperising zone
Once inside the executive
He never leaves his home
Gorillas drag their victims
Hyenas try to sue (in a car jam)
Snakes find grass in concrete
There is no city zoo (in a  car jam)
By ventilation units the towers meet the streets (in a car jam)
The ragged stand in bags soaking heat up through their feet (In a car jam)
This was the only kindness
It was accidental too
In a car jam

Now shaking single engined planes are trafficking stereos from Cuba
Buzzed the holy zealot mass and drowned out Missa Luba
They drowned out Missa Luba
They drowned out Missa Luba
They drowned out Missa Luba
I thought I saw Lauren Bacall
I thought I saw Lauren Bacall
I swear
Hey fellas
Hey fellas
Lauren Bacall
In a car jam
Yeah I don't believe it
In a car jam (car jam)
Ah yeah positively absolutely

In a car jamEmbed
