Overpowered by Funk Lyrics
If you ain't reggae for it, funk out!
No one knockin' at your door? Funk out!
Overpowered by funk? Funk out!
Combatative, repetitive
Don't life just funk you out?
Asinine, stupefying
Can the clone line dry you out?
Part of the swarming mass? Funk out!
Slugged by the new increase? Funk out!
Scared of the human bomb? Funk out!
Overpowered by funk? Funk out!
Buy dog food
Rogue elephants
Tarzan on a ticker tape
Breakfast cereals?
You know you can't escape
Overpowered by funk
Don't you love our Western ways?
Car crashed by funk
Don't you love our Western ways?
Benny Goodman, trial by jury
A phone box full of books
Is my name in there?
Dustcarts at sunrise
No one gets off the hooks
Car crashed
Food for the hungry millions? Funk out!
Home for the floating people? Funk out!
Over-drunk on power
Funk out!
The final game will be solitaire
Over-drunk on power, funk out

This is a message from Futura
Don't prophesize the future
I liven up the culture
Because I'm deadly as a vulture
I paint on civilization
I have this realization
It's environmentally wack
So presenting my attack
And I'll brighten up your shack
I'm down by law
That's a fact
Just give me a wall
Any building, dull or tall
I spray clandestine night subway
I cover red purple on top of grey
An' hey, no slashing 'cause it ain't the way
The T.A. blew 40 mil they say
We thew down by night
An' they scrubbed it off by day
OK tourists
Picture frame
Tickets here for the graffiti train!
Funk power, over-and-outEmbed
