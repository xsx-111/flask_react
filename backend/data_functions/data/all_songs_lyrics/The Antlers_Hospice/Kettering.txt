Kettering Lyrics
I wish that I had known in that first minute we met
The unpayable debt that I owed you
Because you'd been abused by the bone that refused you
And you hired me to make up for that

Walking in that room when you had tubes in your arms
Those singing morphine alarms out of tune
Kept you sleeping and even, and I didn't believe them
When they called you a hurricane thunderclap

When I was checking vitals I suggested a smile
You didn't talk for a while, you were freezing
You said you hated my tone, it made you feel so alone
And so you told me I ought to be leaving

But something kept me standing by that hospital bed
I should have quit, but instead, I took care of you
You made me sleep and uneven, and I didn't believe them
When they told me that there was no saving you32Embed
