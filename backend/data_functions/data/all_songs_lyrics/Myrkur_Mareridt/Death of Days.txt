Death of Days Lyrics
My heart
Floating down the stream
To nowhere
To nowhere
My heart
Bury me in sea
In the waves I belong
In the waves I belong

Solitude
Away I sail
Away I sail
This common life is not for me
Solitude
My coffin nail
To you I hail
This common life is not for me

My heart
Lay the body soft
At twilight
At twilight
And our heart
Mourn the death of days
We had the nights
We had the nights

Solitude
Away I sail
Away I sail
This common life is not for me
Solitude
My coffin nail
To you I hail
This common life is not for meEmbed
