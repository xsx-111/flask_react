Crown LyricsBorn at night
Many are called, few are chosen
Open mouth
Swallow up the lakes frozen
Am I adored?
Je suis votre amour
Am I a whore?
Cause you are the drug
Solitary are the things i know
In my garden they leave me alone
Soft as blood
An open heart holds no reason
Slice me up
Cause your love was steeped in treason
Am I adored?
Je suis votre amour
Am i your whore?
Cause you are the drug
Solitary are the things i know
In my garden they leave me alone
Sleep little darling
Mother virgin
Darkness serpent come to feed me
Sleep little darling
Bathed in moonlight
On her head a crown of twelve starsEmbed
