Gladiatrix LyricsThrow me in the lion's pit
Watch me fight for it
See your eyes on me
This is not reality
I'm still not ready
I'm still not ready
They're waiting for me
But I'm not ready
I touched their houses
I touched their houses
I touched their houses
I touched their houses
I'm still not ready
I'm still not ready
They're waiting for me
But I'm not ready
I touched their houses
I touched their houses
I touched their houses
I touched their housesEmbed
