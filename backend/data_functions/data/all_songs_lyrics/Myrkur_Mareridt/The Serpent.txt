The Serpent LyricsLook in my eyes
You’ll always see a serpent
Run from the dark
You’ll always always feel it
Down your spine
Try me and suffer
Impure from holy wood
Where angels fall
Cause I put a spell on you
And I broke your book of rules
I put a spell on you
And I am the truth
Flooding your gates
My storm is a disturbance
Can you explain
Your doorway’s always hiding
Try me and suffer
Impure from holy wood
Where angels fall
Cause I put a spell on you
And I broke your book of rules
I put a spell on you
And I am the truth1Embed
