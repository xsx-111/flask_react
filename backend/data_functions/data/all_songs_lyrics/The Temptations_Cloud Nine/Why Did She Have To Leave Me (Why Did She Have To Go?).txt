Why Did She Have To Leave Me (Why Did She Have To Go?) Lyrics
Ooh-oh

Once upon a time, my girl and me
Shared our love so tenderly
Then came the day she said the words goodbye
If she only knew how she changed my life
She was my life, the world to me
But when she left, she took the best of me

Oh, why did she have to leave me, why (Why did she have to say goodbye) (I wanna know why)
Oh, (I wanna know why) I want to know now
Girl (Girl come home, so I can dry wipe my weeping eyes) why don't you come on home, girl
I've been cryin' cryin', now listen

A shadow of man that’s all I am
Since that day my girl has been gone
Was it me oh what it could it be
Only yesterday I was king on the throne
Her whereabouts, I wished I knew
I want to her to know
That without her my life is blue
Now why, (Why did she have to leave me, why did she have to say goodbye) why why why why why why
And woah, (I wanna know why) I want to know now
Girl (Girl come home, so I can dry wipe my weeping eyes) why don't you come on home, girl
I can't stand it here without you no longer, listen

She didn’t have to go
That girl knew how much I loved her so
She was the light in my world
The one and only girl, for me, oh oh-oh-oh

Why, (Why did she have to leave me, why did she have to say goodbye) why why why why why why
Oh, (I wanna know why) I want to know baby
Girl (Girl come home, so I can dry wipe my weeping eyes) why don't you come on home, baby
I can't stand it without you

Since you have been gone
My world is slowly turning to dust
So you see find you I must

Why, (Why did she have to leave me, why did she have to say goodbye) why why why why why why
Why, (I wanna know why) I want to know, oh
Girl (Girl come home, so I can dry wipe my weeping eyes) why don't you come on home, baby
I can't stand it without you, oh
Why, (Why did she have to leave me, why did she have to say goodbye) why why why why why why
Oh (I wanna know why)
Girl (Girl come home)Embed
