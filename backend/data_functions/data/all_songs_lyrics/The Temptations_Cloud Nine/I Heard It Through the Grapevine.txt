I Heard It Through the Grapevine Lyrics
I bet you're wonderin' how I knew
About your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
Between the two of us
You know I loved you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer you would be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would end my life you see
Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you loved some one else

Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
People say believe half of what you see
Oh, and none of what you hear
I just can't help but be confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before?

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevineEmbed
