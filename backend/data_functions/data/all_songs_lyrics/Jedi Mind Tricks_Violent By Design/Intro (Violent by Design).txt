Intro (Violent by Design) Lyrics{movie clip}
Beware the beast man
For he is the devils pawn
Alone among gods primates
He kills for sport, or lust, or greed
Yay he will murder his brother to posses his brothers land
Let him not breed in great numbers
For he will make a desert of his home,and yours
Shun him, drive him back into his jungle lair
For he is the harbinger of deathEmbed
