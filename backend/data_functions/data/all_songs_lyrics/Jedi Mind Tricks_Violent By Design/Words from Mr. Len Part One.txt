Words from Mr. Len Part One Lyrics
Ya, so this is like the third time I called and shit
And um, ya hope you got the call
So you don't call us back for 500 dollars, cause I don't have it

Do not want my money, do not request anything of value of mine

They'll think you're cute, they'll think you're fine
But nine months later that shit ain't mine
Yo, I'm outEmbed
