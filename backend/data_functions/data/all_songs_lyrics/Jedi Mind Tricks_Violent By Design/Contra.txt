Contra Lyrics
The invincible huh?
Yeah, y'all be seeing it
It is what it is indeed, Stoupie
Y'all be knowing huh?
Let 'em know

Hold the device tight, when it's time for a mic fight
You're a pagan trying to battle someone who's Christ-like
The precise knight that smash you with a white pike
Left you bleeding into the ocean under the night's light
Oh you hype right, well meet the soul-benders
Cop that or get shot at like goaltenders
You roll benches till playing fear was fair game
Y'all got fucked up like sex on an airplane
That's why we can't change, we just ill
We blow trees, sip Ole E's and spit real
The clip's filled with the wrath that Cain saw
Then I slash with a leather mask and chainsaw
That's why the brain's raw, that's why your veins pour
That's why you copped my shit nine times at the same store
That's why you entered the dragon and got slashed
And that's why the Hologram counting up cash
What!
Looking for rappers who wanna battle
Don't seem to understand that I'm just that bad
The underground rapper who be wrecking
Whatever ya want yo, whatever ya like

Holocaust rap, javelin toss, the Sha's the boss
I take what's yours, pour poison in your pores
I'm down for the cause my nigga, not because
My soul wasn't made to be lost, stop for the pause
I play forty-eight minutes hard, without the calls
Slicing elbows through ya jaw, need I say more?
Fascinated with four-fours and foul whores
Large gram cook-ups and the ill drug scores
My captivating verses, that'll open all doors
I soar like a condor ready for war, fuck the law!

Listen to the emptiness
Of the raindrops on the ground

Looking for rappers who wanna battle
Don't seem to understand that I'm just that bad
The underground rapper who be wrecking
Whatever ya want yo, whatever ya like
Ominous, leave your brain matter painted on your Stainmaster
Game of Death motherfucker, we draft ya, semi-autograph ya
Keeping L's lit, sending pellets through helmets
Shells hit, you and the fag you share a cell with
Taking niggas out their element, rhyme fighters
Divine writers, time travelers, Sliders
Pale niggas act jail lifers
True tale is that they nail-biters with the trails in they diapers
Shoes never walk nor land, explore land
I expose my scrolls and code it in Fortran
Bullets graze your wig kid, brushes with death
I let the iron clutch grip the bones in ya flesh
Playing on ya wrist like strings on a violin
Dying in a blood pool, wrestling Leviathan
Fucking with gods, Jedi Mind Tricks
Y'all suckers, like niggas born without dicksEmbed
