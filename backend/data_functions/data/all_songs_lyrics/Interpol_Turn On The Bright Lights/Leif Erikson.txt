Leif Erikson Lyrics
She says it helps with the lights out
Her rabid glow is like braille to the night
She swears I’m a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big joke, why should I care?

The clock is set for nine but you know you’re gonna make it eight
So that you two can take some time, teach each other to reciprocate

She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids' gloves
But she doesn’t know that I left my urge in the icebox
She swears I’m just prey for the female
Well then hook me up and throw me, baby cakes, 'cause I like to get hooked

The clock is set for nine but you know you’re gonna make it eight
All the people that you’ve loved, they’re all bound to leave some keepsakes
I’ve been swinging all the time, think it’s time I learned your way
I picture you and me together in the jungle, it would be ok

I’ll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
That is supposing that you don’t sleep tonight
It’s like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don’t bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time
It’s like learning a new language
You come here to me
We’ll collect those lonely parts and set them down
You come here to me

She says brief things, her love’s a pony
My love’s subliminal
She says brief things, her love’s a pony
My love’s subliminal18Embed
