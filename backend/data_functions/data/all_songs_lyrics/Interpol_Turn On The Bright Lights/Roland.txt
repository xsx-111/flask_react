Roland Lyrics
Shhhh
C'mon, c'mon
Hey!

My best friend's a butcher, he has sixteen knives
He carries them all over the town at least he tries
Oh look, it stopped snowing
My best friend's from Poland and, oh, he has a beard
But they caught him with his case in a public place
That is what we had feared

He severed segments and secretly liked that
He always took the time to speak with me, I liked him for that
He severed segments and secretly liked that
(What is this a throwaway? What is this a throwaway?)
He always took the time
He always took the time

C'mon now, pussycat

My best friend's a butcher, he has sixteen knives
He carries them all over the town at least he tries
Oh look, it stopped snowing
And my best friend's from Poland and, oh, he has a beard
But they caught him with his case in a public place
That is what he had feared
He severed segments and secretly liked that
He always took the time to speak with me and I liked him for that
He severed segments and secretly liked that
(What is this a throwaway? What is this a throwaway?)
He was growing on me
(What is this a throwaway? What is this a throwaway?)
(What is this a throwaway? What is this a throwaway?)
He was growing on me
(What is this a throwaway? What is this a throwaway?)
(What is this a throwaway? What is this a throwaway?)

Alright
Yeah
Ahh
Yeah
Yeah, that's the one3Embed
