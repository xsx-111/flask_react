Say Hello to the Angels Lyrics
I want your silent parts, the parts the birds love
I know there's such a place
I had my back turned, you didn't realize
I'm lonely
You lack the things to which I relate
But I see no harm
Come wait, come wait, come wait
It's over
Yeah, one, two, three, do me

When I'm feeling lazy, it's probably because
I'm saving all my energy to pick up when you move into
My airspace
Move into my airspace
And something's coming over me, I see you in the doorway
I can't control the part of me that swells up when you move into
My airspace
Move into my airspace

But each night, I bury my love around you
Oh, each night, I bury my love around you
You're linked to my innocence
This is a concept, this is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention
This is a concept, this is a bracelet
This isn't no intervention
This isn't you yet
What you thought was such a conquest
Your hair is so pretty and red
Baby, baby, you're really the best

Can I get there this way? Yeah, I think so
Can I get there this way? I think so
Can I get there this way? Can I get there this way?
Can I get there this way? Can I get there this way?

We should take a trip now to see new places
I'm sick of this town, I see my face has changed
We should take a trip now to see new places
I'm sick of this town, I see my face has changed

Say hello, say hello, to the angels
Say hello, say hello
