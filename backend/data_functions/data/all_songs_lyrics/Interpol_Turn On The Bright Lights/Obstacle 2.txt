Obstacle 2 Lyrics
I'm gonna pull you in close, gonna wrap you up tight
Gonna play with the braids that you came here with tonight
I'm gonna hold your face and toast the snow that fell
Because friends don't waste wine when there's words to sell

I feel like love is in the kitchen with a culinary eye
I think he's making something special and I'm smart enough to try
If you don't trust yourself for at least one minute each day
Well, you should trust in this, girl, cause loving is coming our way

If you can fix me up, girl, you'll go a long way
If you can fix me up, girl, you'll go a long way

I'll stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days
(Take my love in these small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight
(Take my love in these small doses)
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place
(Take my love in these small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight
(Take my love in these small doses)
In my mind
This is my free time
Because friends don't waste wine when there's words to sell
If you can fix me up, girl, you'll go a long way
If you can fix me up, girl, you'll go a long way

I'll stand by all this drinking if it helps me through these days
(Take my love in these small doses)
I've spent a long time corresponding in my own way
(Take my love in these small doses)
I'll showcase on Route 7 when I find the right place
(Take my love in these small doses)
It takes a long time just to get this all straight
(Take my love in these small doses)
In my mind
This is my free time

To break it all away
Spend it all today
Spend it all today
It took time, then I found you
It took time, then I found you
It took time, then I found you
It took time, then I found you, oh, oh
Ooh
