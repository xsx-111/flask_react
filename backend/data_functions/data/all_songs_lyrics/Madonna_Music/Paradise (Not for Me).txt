Paradise (Not for Me) Lyrics
I can't remember when I was young
I can't explain if it was wrong
My life goes on, but not the same
Into your eyes my face remains

I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground
I was so blind, I could not see
Your paradise is not for me

Autour de moi, je ne vois pas
Qui sont les anges? Sûrement pas moi
Encore une fois, je suis cassée
Encore une fois, je ne crois pas

I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground

There is a light above my head
Into your eyes, my face remains
I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground

I can't remember when I was young
Into your eyes, my face remains
Into your eyes, my face remains

I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground
I've been so high, I've been so down
Up to the skies, down to the ground1Embed
