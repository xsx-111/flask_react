Gone Lyrics
Selling out is not my thing
Walk away, I won't be broken again
I'm not, I'm not what you think
Dream away your life, someone else's dream
Nothing equals nothing

Letting go is not my thing
Walk away, won't let it happen again
I'm not, I'm not very smart
Why should I feel sad for what I never had?
Nothing equals nothing

Turn to stone, lose my faith
I'll be gone before it happens
Turn to stone, lose my faith
I'll be gone before it happens

Selling out, is not my thing
Walk away, I won't be broken again
I won't, I won't fall apart
Dream away your life, dream away your dream
Nothing equals nothing
Turn to stone, lose my faith
I'll be gone before it happens
Turn to stone, lose my faith
I'll be gone before it happens
Turn to stone (Turn to stone)
Lose my faith (Lose my faith)
I'll be gone before it happens
Turn to stone (Turn to stone)
Lose my faith (Lose my faith)
I'll be gone1Embed
