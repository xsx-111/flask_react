Strange Things Lyrics(Blood ran yellow-grey)
The blood ran yellow-grey
(The blood ran yellow-grey)
Why do I breathe? Why do I work?
(I don't have a choice)
Who the hell runs the world?
(He don't feel anything)
Strange things I have seen
(Strange things I have done)
Strange things I have done
(Strange things I have done)
Break the walls, break the walls
(Break the walls)
Break the walls, bring them back to the sound hive
(Bring them back to the sound hive)
I'm going, I'm going
(I'm telling you)
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone1Embed
