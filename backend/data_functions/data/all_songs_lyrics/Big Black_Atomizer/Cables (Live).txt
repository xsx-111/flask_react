Cables (Live) Lyrics
"Louder! Louder!"

Well, I don't know why we come here
Guess I just needed the bang
We walk in the beef, and then we pull on the rope
And then the, then the hammer goes down

Cables!
Cables!
Cables!

So I guess they know
I'm not no company man
But I can pull on a rope, I can kill a cow
As well as any other fucker can

Cables!
Cables!
Cables!Embed
