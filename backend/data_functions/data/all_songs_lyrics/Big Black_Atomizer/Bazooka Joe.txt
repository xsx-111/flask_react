Bazooka Joe LyricsThe Joe man is back
When Joe comes back, Joe's head will crack
When Joe's head cracks
When that big head cracks
It's "Welcome back, Joe
Welcome back, Joe."
You don't have to be alone Joe
You don't have to be alone Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
You don't have to be alone Joe
You don't have to be alone Joe
The Joe man is back
When Joe man comes back, Joe's head will crack
When that big head cracks
It's "Welcome back, Joe
Welcome back, Joe."
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Oh, you don't have to be alone Joe
You don't have to be alone Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe

It's been a long time, Joe
Been a long time, Joe
Been a long time, I know
You don't have to be alone Joe
You don't have to be alone
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Say it ain't so, Joe
Say it ain't so, Joe
Say it ain't so, Joe
You don't have to be alone, Joe
You don't have to be alone, Joe
Place for us, Joe
There's a place for us, Joe
We'll do all the things that you used to do
We'll do all the things that you used to do
Just the way it was, Joe
Just the way it was, Joe
Just the way it was, Joe
Hang with me, Joe
Hang with me, Joe

Show you the ropes, Joe
Show you the ropes, Joe
