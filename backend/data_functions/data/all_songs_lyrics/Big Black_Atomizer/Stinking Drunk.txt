Stinking Drunk Lyrics(Go!)
Been so long
Forgot what it's like
Like swimming, like sex, like a kick in the bag
Like a fistfight
Think it's time I got stinking drunk
Think it's time
Been so long
What brought me to this?
Been so long
Forgot what it's like
Like fighting, like sex, like a kick in the bag
Think it's time I got stinking drunk
Think it's time
You shut up!
(Go!)
Get drunk, get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk, get drunk
Get drunk, get drunk, stinking drunkEmbed
