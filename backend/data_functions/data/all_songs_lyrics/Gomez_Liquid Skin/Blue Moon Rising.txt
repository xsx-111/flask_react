Blue Moon Rising Lyrics(whispered: Some people like that
Some people like that
Some people like that)
Come on all my people, come one and all, one and all
If you want all your people right there right then
Your better lady's dead and they're appalled
And they're appalled
Come into my palace, come and see my hollow walls
The servants crawl
It's gonna be a blue moon rising, rising one and all, one and all
Some people like that
Gonna get them with your money, all that shines gets polished bald
Divide and fall
Gonna get them like a Tweedledee or a Tweedledum
Glossiest sales pitch ain't an equal sum
It ain't gonna be fun
Come into my dreamworld, a simple smile not a loaded gun
Just a shine in the sun
It's gonna be a blue moon rising, rising one and all, one and all
Some people like that
Some people like that
Some people like that
We're sulking like children in the moonlight, aa-ooh
We're sulking like children in the moonlight, aa-ooh
We're sulking like children in the moonlight, aa-ooh
We're sulking like children in the moonlight, aa-ooh
It's gonna be a blue moon rising, rising one and all, one and all
It's gonna be a blue moon rising, rising one and all
Some people like that
Some people like that
Some people like that (repeat to end)
(Ben: Blue moon rising
Blue moon rising)Embed
