Las Vegas Dealer LyricsGoodbye Lauren Lee, my precious Lauren Lee has gone
Gone so far away now, won't be back today or tomorrow
Goodbye Lauren Lee, my precious Lauren Lee has gone out
But is he away with the fairies, is he away with me?
Take him away, it's free, I play anywhere I choose
Did he get into the sequel, how is Leno these days?
Take it away, 'cause I don't care whether we win or lose
Yeah, whether we win or lose
All my chips are down, my precious chips are almost gone
Find a better caller, dealer man without a son
Put it all on one, I feel like number one is on now
But is he away with the fairies, is he away with me?
Take him away, it's free, I play anywhere I choose
Did he get into the sequel, how is Nuno these days?
Take it away, 'cause I don't care whether we win or lose
Yeah, whether we win or lose
Goodbye Lauren Lee, my precious Lauren Lee has gone out
Yeah, whether we win or lose, whether we win or lose
Yeah, whether we win or lose
But is he away with the fairies, is he away with me?
Take him away, it's free, I play anywhere I choose
Did he get into the sequel, how is Nuno these days?
Take it away, 'cause I don't care whether we win or lose
Yeah, whether we win or loseEmbed
