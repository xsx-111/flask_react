Rhythm & Blues Alibi LyricsYou can write your tunes with rhythm and blues as your alibi
You can sell your soul and lay the blame all on the passers-by
You shake your body on the TV screen
It seems to me, you'd try anything twice
And swing it out and use it as your aphrodisiac
You can give it to me, to me
Plain to see that I'll give it you back
You let it flow, let it go, there's nothing to it
Anyone can try anything twice, try anything twice
Chasing after stories that have already been told
Could not look old Son House in the eyes
Unaware you carry such a fragile load
But I've got yours, and you've got mine
It's a rhythm and blues alibi
La la la la la la la la la la laaa..
You can take a trip through your juke joint smoke-filled paradise
You can give it your all, 'cause you are walking a fine, fine line, la
You shake your booty on the TV screen
Seems to me, you'd try anything twice
You'd try anything twice
Well let me hear you now..
Chasing after stories that have already been told
Could not look old Son House in the eyes
Unaware you carry such a fragile load
And I've got yours, you've got mine
It's a rhythm and blues alibi
La la la la laEmbed
