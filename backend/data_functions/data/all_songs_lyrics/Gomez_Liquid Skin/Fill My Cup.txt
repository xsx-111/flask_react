Fill My Cup LyricsWe're nowhere in particular
We're nowhere, nowhere at all
So fill my cup, make me happen
Fill it up, make me smile
Fill my cup, give me a reason
A reason to feel alright
Don't you worry, sweet darling
It's gonna be alright
It seems that I've been sleeping
Been sleeping all my life
Been sleeping all my life
Been sleeping all my life
I sleep alone
On my very own
Sitting sick at home
Baby, up, make me happen
Wake me up, make it right
Weigh me up, give me the reason
The reason to feel alright
Don't you worry, sweet darling
It's gonna be alright
It seems that I've been sleeping
Been sleeping all my life
Been sleeping all my life
Picking up girls who have diseases
That burn me up, burn me up
Been sleeping all my life
Fill my cup, make me happen
Fill my cup, make me smileEmbed
