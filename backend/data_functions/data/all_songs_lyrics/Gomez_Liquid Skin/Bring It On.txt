Bring It On LyricsIf I was inordinately different
Than what you say
I'd lie, I would lie
If you could release me now
You know that I won't hesistate
To lie, I would lie
Bring it on, make it right
Bring it out, to the light
Pick me up, satellite
If it's wrong, make it right
If I lied and told you that
You're difficult or hard to take
I'd lie, I'd still lie
If you tried to please me now
You know that I won't remonstrate
But lie, I would lie
Bring it on, make it right
Bring it out, to the light
Pick me up, satellite
If it's wrong, make it right
We like quiet nights on the island
Weave battered stars round our heads
We can reach new heights in this silence
We're dragged slowly towards the edge
Bring it on, make it right
Bring it out, to the light
Pick me up, satellite
If it's wrong, make it right
Bring it on, make it right
Bring it out, to the light
Pick me up, satellite
If it's wrong, make it right
If I was inordinately differentEmbed
