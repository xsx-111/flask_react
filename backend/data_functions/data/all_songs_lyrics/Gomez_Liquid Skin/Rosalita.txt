Rosalita LyricsRosalita's crawling round the knees
Rest my head, she's calling to me
In my dreams she's there for me
But open my eyes to see you there
I am falling
Sweetness, since you left me
It's been your flag I'm flying
But I'm sick of crying
Why did you choose to deceive me?
Was your plan just to kiss, fuck and leave me?
So, considerately, just please talk to me
I won't portray myself so pitifully
My little conceit, you see
Is that I will not need you more than now
Rosalita's walking out on me
Close the door, she's stalling, I see
She's so sweet, but not for me
But as we sit around and laugh about
She's trying to call me
Darling, though you hurt me
It's not from my lack of trying
You've got a fear of flying high
You have lost your patience
I see myself sink in your estimations
Forget the salutations
Just please study these tears
Your bitter words they just confirm my fears
Gonna let it fuck up all the years
Yet I will not need you more than now
Beautiful bitch, I could consider this a simple glitch
You're just a hopeless stitch in time
But then for your crimes
Please find yourself a little guilty with these lines
Got your conscience on my mind
Because I could not need you more
Oh, I could not need you more
Yeah, I could not need you more than now
Could not need you more than nowEmbed
