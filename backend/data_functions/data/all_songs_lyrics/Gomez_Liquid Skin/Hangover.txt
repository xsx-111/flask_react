Hangover LyricsBe the light from my window
Be the time at my table
Be my hangover girl
Be my hangover girl
Be my hangover girl
Be my hangover girl
Share the wine at my table
Out of my mind see me stable
Find the time, be my cradle
Be my hell of a girl
See my hell of a girl
Be my hell of a girl
See my hell of a girl
She waters down the rain when I get home
Be my hangover girl
See my hangover girl
Be my hangover girl
See my hangover girl
She waters down the rain when I get home
It's gonna rain when I get home
It's gonna rain when I get home
It's gonna rain when I get home
It's gonna rain when I get homeEmbed
