Devil Will Ride LyricsGuess it's bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Guess it's bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
If you will, devil may ride
Invitation makes you feel fly
If you will, devil may ride
Well, the invitation makes you feel fly
If you will, devil will ride
Well, the invitation makes you feel fly
Did you ever even try
When the inspiration's set to run dry?
Well, everybody wants a good time
Yeah, and everybody wants a good time
It's a goodbye
World going mad out there
Throw away all of your treasured possessions
'Cause even the Royal Mail
Can't deliver us from what we've got into
Guess it's bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Guess it's bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
You know it
Oh, so good I could just live for this lie
Oh, 'cause everybody wants to get by
It's too easy to like this living
Been taking it easy again
It's too easy to like this living
If you will, the devil will ride
But the invitation makes you feel fly
Did you ever even try
When the inspiration's set to run dry?
Did you ever even writhe
When the conversation turned to a guy?
And everybody wants a good time
Yeah, and everybody wants a good time
It's a goodbye
World going mad out there
Throw away all of your treasured possessions
Not even the Royal Mail
Can deliver us from what we've got into
Guess it's bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Guess it's bye-bye, baby, bye-bye
Devil will ride
If you will, devil will ride
If you will, devil will ride
If you will, devil will rideEmbed
