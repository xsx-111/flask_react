Pizza Man (Skit) Lyrics Excuse me ma'am, Domino's, your pizza's here
 Pizza? Did I order pizza?
 30 minutes or less
 Oh well, maybe...
 Okay, okay
 Uh
 It's a nice house you have
 Oh yeah, I decorated it, do you like the velvet paintings?
 Yeah, well I'll just wait here by the TV
 Okay, I'll get my money
*Del grunts heavily out of exhaustion, and ends it with saying "alley-oop"*
 Woah! Hold on buster!
 *Laughs*
 What are you doing?
 I'm sorry ma'amEmbed
