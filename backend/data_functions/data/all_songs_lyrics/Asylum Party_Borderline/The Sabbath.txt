The Sabbath LyricsWhite flying horse
Sings the magic
His dream takes you
Back to the beginning
The sorceress
Is black widow
She starts to dance
With fire in her hands
Moonless night
Ninety years old
A young elf
Between darkness and dawn
Voices and drums
All demons are there
Frenzy and moves
It's the sweetest nightmare
Join the pagan mass
Lost souls are free nowEmbed
