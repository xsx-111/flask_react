Better Days Ahead LyricsDo remember
Lost like the last boy
Waiting for more lights
Close to the loam
He keeps on looking for
Squeletal shadows on the ground
How could it last
When fear's so simple
Wake up another day
And how much we laugh
Longing for nothing
You should hope for more better days
Hope for better days1Embed
