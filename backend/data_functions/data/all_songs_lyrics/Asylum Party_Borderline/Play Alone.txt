Play Alone LyricsMy feet cross the present ground
My voice is dead
I can only hear the sound
Of my own shade
I'm filling that hole
Which is just my soul, just my soul
Desire somewhere inside me
Is so close and so far anyway
It makes me see in white and black
This fucking endless movie I call life
Mute love made me lose my faith
And still kills me
Silent wars have changed my face
When will I be free?
I'm playing alone with my poisoned dreams
Poisoned dreams
Desire somewhere inside me
Is so close and so far anyway
It makes me see in white and black
This fucking endless movie I call life
My feet cross the present ground
My voice is dead
I can only hear the sound
Of my own shade
I'm filling that hole
Which is just my soul, just my soul
I'm playing alone with my poisoned dreamsEmbed
