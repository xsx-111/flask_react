Old Dreams Are Not Innocent LyricsSo sad
To live here
To get nothing
By a grey Sunday
Someone was born
Something ended
Old dreams of you
Old dreams satisfy
So dirty
Looking at old ages
Looking at madness
How much time
Before calling
Mother's help
Old dreams of you
Old dreams satisfy
Old dreams are not innocent
So sad
To live here
To get nothing
By a grey Sunday
Something’s ended
Someone has grown upEmbed
