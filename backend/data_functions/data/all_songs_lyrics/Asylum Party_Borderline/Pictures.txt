Pictures LyricsSomething broke one day
And he stopped talking
Something broke in the head
Young child stopped looking out
Something talks away
Some shrieks of laughter
Besounding in the air
An inner call to be loved
Take off those pictures
That make me cry, that kill me
Something comes too late
Lower than whispers
Something has come too late
The mad desire to be here againEmbed
