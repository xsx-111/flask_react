Winter LyricsMystery on your face
Like a sudden spell
Makes me build my own jail
Makes me live in Hell
In these days of Winter
Cold sun shines for you
You feel like in danger
Love's not far from you
I'm creating a new game
But I don't know its rules
Should I find someone to blame?
If I like playing the fool
Hope is going away
You will never know
How I felt in these days
Of one way love and snowEmbed
