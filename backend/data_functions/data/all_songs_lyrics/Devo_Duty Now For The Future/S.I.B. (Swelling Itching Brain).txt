S.I.B. (Swelling Itching Brain) LyricsGot a nervous kind of feeling
Got a painful yellow headache
Every picture in every magazine's turned real
Every face looks out and screams at me, too real
Cold sweat on my collar
Dripping to my boots
The waves of nauseous pain sets off the pressure pad alarms
Gotta get outta here
Gotta get outta here
Gotta get outta here
Gotta get outta here
Got a painful swelling brain
Banging in my head
Got a painful swelling brain
And I called off sick
Got a swelling itching pain
Got me pulling out my hair
Got a swelling itching pain
Clutching at my brain
Got a painful swelling brain
In the back of my head
Got a painful swelling brain
And I called off sick
Got a swelling itching pain
Got me pulling out my hair
Got a swelling itching pain
Clutching at my brain
Got a painful swelling brain
Got me laying on the floor
Got a painful swelling brain
Think I left my senses
Got a swelling itching pain
Seems like endless torture
Got a swelling itching pain
Banging in my head
Got a painful swelling brain
In the back of my head
Got a painful swelling brain
And I called off sick
Got a painful swelling brain
Got me pulling out my hair
Got a painful swelling brain
Clutching at my brain
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain
Driving me up the wall
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain
Dripping out my eyes, ears, nose, and mouth
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain
Imploding my thoughts
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain
Blasting holes in my front lawn now
Got a swelling itching pain, swelling itching pain
Clutching at my brain
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain
Got me laying on the floor
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain
Going out of my skull
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain, painful swelling
Burning up my thoughts
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain, painful swelling
Dripping out my eyes, ears, nose, and mouth
Got a painful swelling brain, painful swelling brain, painful swelling
Tearing me apart2Embed
