Strange Pursuit Lyrics
Intersecting love lines drew us closer every day
Always kept your distance when you felt my presence near you
Love keeps on rolling over

Fly in retreat, I would follow without shame
A stupid spud staggering to the flame
To be had and re-had, be a victim of the pain

Now it's strange, it's so strange
(It's a strange pursuit)
(It's a strange pursuit)
(It's a strange pursuit)

Well I come running like a fat boy in lead shoes
Running like a fat boy huff-puffing after you
It's hopeless to hope for the one thing that I'm wanting

'Cause it's strange, it's so very strange
(It's a strange pursuit)
Darling, I'm dazzled but you know I'm too frazzled
(It's a strange pursuit)
It's takin' my mind apart and lost some of the pieces
(It's a strange pursuit)
You know it's getting tough when you're getting real rough
(It's a strange pursuit)
Darling, I'm dazzled but you know I'm too frazzled
(It's a strange pursuit)
Takin' my mind apart and lost some of the pieces
(It's a strange pursuit)Embed
