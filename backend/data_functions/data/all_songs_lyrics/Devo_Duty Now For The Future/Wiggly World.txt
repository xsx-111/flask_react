Wiggly World LyricsThey say the fittest shall survive
Yet the unfit may live
Let 'em wear gaudy colors
Or avoid display
Hey it don't matter
It's all the same
So I do this and I do that
So I do this and I do that
So I do this and I do that
It's never straight up and down
It's never straight up and down
It's never straight up and down
It's never straight up and down
Oh you got a nickel
I got a dime
I'd like to get to know you
But I haven't got the time
You gotta walk like a mannequin
Roll like a tire
Act on reaction
Dodge the big spud fryer
So wiggle on the bottom
Wiggle on the top
Wiggle up the middle
And laugh a lot
Cause I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world, a wiggly world
I got to tell you
I've been living in a wiggly world now
Wiggly world, a wiggly world
Well I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world, a wiggly wor/d
I got to tell you
I've been living in a wiggly world
WiggIy world, a wiggly world
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Yeah I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world
Oh I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world
Well I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world
Well I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world
Well I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world
Well I've been Iiving
In a wiggly world now
Wiggly world
Well I've been living in a wiggly world
Wiggly world
Oh, I've been living in a wiggly
Wiggly world1Embed
