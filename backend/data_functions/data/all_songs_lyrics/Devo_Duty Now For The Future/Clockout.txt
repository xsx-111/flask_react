Clockout Lyrics
All right
Clock out

I got my coat, I got my keys
I got my head down to my lungs
And move my feet
Me, I got all the secretaries
Down on their knees

Look at ‘em scoot
They gonna clock out

I got my money tied up in stock
I got my mammy take my
Doggie for a walk
Me, I got the biggest little business
Down on the block

Get ready, get set
‘Cause we gonna clock out
Down on all fours
‘Cause we gonna clock out

Take my advice, hear my decree
I'm afraid the futures gonna be
Maintenance free
I got the big brush for your bowl
Baby can’t you dig my plea

Gonna gag
Unless we, uh, clock out

Ooh hoo hoo, no, no, no1Embed
