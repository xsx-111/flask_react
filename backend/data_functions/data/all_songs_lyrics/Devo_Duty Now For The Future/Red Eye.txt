Red Eye LyricsLet me tell you a story
Let me shovel some dirt
Long time, no sugar
And it's starting to hurt
Something's floating in my cola
Something's wrong with my brew
Something's rotten in Idaho
And I don't know what to do
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Only go around once
Gotta quench that thirst
Gotta grab that gusto
Gotta get there first

Something's flattening my cola
Something's wrong with my brew
Something's rotten in Idaho
And I don't know what to do
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
On the Red Eye Express
Gone, gone, gone
With the red eye distress
Gone, gone, gone
