Smart Patrol / Mr. DNA Lyrics
(He's been with the world)
I'm tired of the soup du jour
(He's been with the world)
I wanna end this prophylactic tour
Afraid that no-one around me
Understands my potato
Think I'm only a spud boy
Looking for a real tomato

(He's been with the world)
I'm tired of the soup du jour
(He's been with the world)
I wanna end this prophylactic tour
Afraid nobody around here
Understands my potato
I think I'm only a spud boy
Looking for a real tomato

(He's been with the world)
I'm tired of the soup du jour
(He's been with the world)
I wanna end this prophylactic tour
Afraid nobody around here
Comprehends my potato
Guess I'm just a spud boy
Looking for that real tomato
We're Smart Patrol, nowhere to go
Suburban robots that monitor reality
Common stock, we work around the clock
We shove the poles in the holes
We're Smart Patrol, nowhere to go
Suburban robots that monitor reality
Common stock, we work around the clock
We shove the poles in the holes
We're Smart Patrol, nowhere to go
Suburban robots that monitor reality
Common stock, we work around the clock
We shove the poles in the holes
(shove it)
We're Smart Patrol, nowhere to go
Suburban robots that monitor reality
Common stock, we work around the clock
We shove the poles in the holes

Wait a minute, something's wrong
He's a man with a plan
He's here to do us a favor
A little human sacrifice
It's just supply and demand
Mr Kamikaze, Mr DNA
He's an altruistic pervert, Mr DNA
Mr Kamikaze, here to spread some genes
Mr Kamikaze, Mr DNA
He's an altruistic pervert, Mr DNA
Mr Kamikaze, here to spread some genes
Mr Kamikaze, Mr DNA
He's an altruistic pervert, Mr DNA
Mr Kamikaze, here to spread some-

Wait a minute, something's wrong
He's a man with a plan
His finger's pointed at Devo
Now we must sacrifice ourselves
So many others may live
Oh baby we got a lot to give
This monkey wants a word with you!

Mr Kamikaze, Mr DNA
He's an altruistic pervert, Mr DNA
Mr Kamikaze, here to spread some genes now
Mr Kamikaze, Mr DNA
He's an altruistic pervert, Mr DNA
Mr Kamikaze, here to spread some genes now
Mr Kamikaze, Mr DNA
He's an altruistic pervert, Mr DNA
Mr Kamikaze, here to spread some
One, two, three, four2Embed
