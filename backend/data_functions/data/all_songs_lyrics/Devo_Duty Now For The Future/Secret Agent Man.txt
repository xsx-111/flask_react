Secret Agent Man LyricsYou know I live a life of danger for the FBI
Keeping tabs on our nation on the land, on the sea, in the sky
But every single night before I go to bed
I get down on my knees and thank God
I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given me a number
But they've taken away my name
I got one hell of a job to perform for the U.S. of A
Got the responsibility of our nation's top security
But every night and day, I salute the flag and say
"Thank you, Jesus," 'cause I'm
I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given me a number
But they've taken away my name
You know they got me doin' this, doin' that
And a little bit of something else
Fighting cavities of evil and safeguarding America's health
But not an afternoon passes I don't get up off my ass
Thank you, God, 'cause I'm
I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given me a number
But they've taken away my name
'Cause I'm a secret agent man1Embed
