Blockhead Lyrics
Never leaves a gap
Unfilled
Always pays on time
Always fits the bill
He comes well prepared

Cube top
Squared off
Eight corners
90-degree angles
Flat top
Stares straight ahead
Stock parts
Blockhead!

Never tips over
Stands up on his own
He is a blockhead
Thinking man full grown
He comes well prepared

Cube top
Squared off
Eight corners
90-degree angles
Flat top
Stares straight ahead
Snake eyes
Blockhead
Flat top
Stares straight ahead
Stock parts
Blockhead!

Never tips over
Stands up on his own
He is a blockhead
Thinking man full grown
He comes well prepared

Snake eyes (Blockhead!)
Blockhead (Blockhead!)
Cube top (Blockhead!)
Squared off (Blockhead!)
Eight corners (Blockhead!)
90-degree angles
Flat top (Blockhead!)
Stares straight ahead (Blockhead!)
Stock parts (Blockhead!)
