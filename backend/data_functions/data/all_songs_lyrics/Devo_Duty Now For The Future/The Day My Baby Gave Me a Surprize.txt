The Day My Baby Gave Me a Surprize Lyrics
I got a surprise from my honey
I got a message from my girl
When she picked up a pen from the side of the bed
And wrote me a scribbled note
That she was coming back to see me
She was visiting real soon
Gonna get up from the long, white bed
And leave this cold white room

Wah-ooo
Wah-ooo
Wah-ooo

We would once more live together
Go out on a loving spree
Just like before the accident
My baby would look at me
I saw her sweet face trembling
As she tried to open her eyes
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy
The day my baby gave me a surprise

Wah-ooo
Wah-ooo
Wah-ooo
I got a surprise from my honey
I got a message from my girl
When she picked up a pen from the side of the bed
And wrote me a scribbled note
I saw her sweet face trembling
As she tried to open her eyes
I jumped with the joy of a grateful boy
The day my baby gave me a surprise

Wah-ooo
Wah-ooo
Wah-oooEmbed
