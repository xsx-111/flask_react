Fight from the Inside Lyrics
Hey you, boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you
Know what you're doin'?
You think you're gonna
Set things to rights
You're just another picture
On a teenage wall
You're just another sucker
Ready for a fall

You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, aah!
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

Hey you, boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you
Know what you're doin'?
You think that out
In the streets is all free
You're just another money-spinner tool
You're just another, fool
You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, Aah!
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

Right down the line
Right down the line3Embed
