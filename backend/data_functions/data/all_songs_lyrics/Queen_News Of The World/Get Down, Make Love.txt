Get Down, Make Love Lyrics
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

You take my body, I give you heat
You say you're hungry, I give you meat
I suck your mind, you blow my head
Make love (Make love) inside your bed
Everybody get down, make love

Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get hot
You wanna cool down
Every time I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's too much
Every time I get a
Get down, get down
Get down, make love
(Get down) I can squeeze
(Make love) you can shake me
(Get down) I can feel
(Make love) when you break me
(Get down) Come on so heavy (make love)
(Get down) when you take me
(Make love) You make love
You make love
(Get down) you make love
You make love
(Make love) You can make everybody

Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get high
You wanna come down
Every time I get hot
You say you want to cool down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's too much
Every time I wanna
Get down, get down, get down
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Aah!

Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

Every time I get hot
You wanna cool down
Every time I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's just too much
Every time I wanna
Get down, get down
Get down, make love2Embed
