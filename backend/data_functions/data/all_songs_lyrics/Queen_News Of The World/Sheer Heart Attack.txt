Sheer Heart Attack Lyrics
Well, you're just seventeen
All you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean
There's a lot of space between our ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothing

Hey, hey, hey, hey
It was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey
That made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so
Inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inarticulate

Gotta feeling, gotta feeling
Gotta feeling, like I'm paralyzed
It ain't no, it ain't no
It ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV
Let it drip right down in your eyes
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey
That made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so inar-inar-inar-inar
Inar-inar-inar-inarticulate

Just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?

Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
