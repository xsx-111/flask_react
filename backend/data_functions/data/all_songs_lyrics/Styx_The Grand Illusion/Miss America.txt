Miss America Lyrics
You were the apple of the public's eye
As you cut the ribbon at the local mall
A mirage for both you and us
How can this be real?

We love your body in that photograph
Your home state sure must be proud
The queen of the United States
Have you lost your crown?

Well, aren't you (Miss America?)
Don't you (Miss America?)
Won't you (Miss America, our love?)

Well, are you really who we think you are?
Or does your smile seem to wear you down?
Is the girl who you once were
Screaming to jump out?

In the dream that you must live
A disease for which there is no cure
This rollercoaster ride you're on
Won't stop to let you off
Well, aren't you (Miss America?)
Don't you (Miss America?)
Won't you (Miss America, our love?)
Miss America
Miss America
Miss America
Miss America
Miss America
Miss America
Well, aren't you (Miss America?)
Don't you (Miss America?)
Won't you (Miss America, our love?)

Well, it's true just take a look
The cover sometimes makes the book
And the judges, did they ever ask
To read between your lines?

In your cage at the human zoo
They all stop to look at you
Next year, what will you do
When you have been forgotten?
Aren't you (Miss America?)
Don't you (Miss America?)
Won't you (Miss America, our love?)

Miss America
Miss America
