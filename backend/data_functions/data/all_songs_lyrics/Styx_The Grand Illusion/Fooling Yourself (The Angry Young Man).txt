Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man) Lyrics
Relax, take it easy

You see the world through your cynical eyes
You're a troubled young man I can tell
You got it all in the palm of your hand
But your hand's wet with sweat, and your head needs a rest

And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're kidding yourself if you don't believe it

Why must you be such an angry young man
When your future looks quite bright to me?
And how can there be such a sinister plan
That could hide such a lamb, such a caring young man?

And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're killing yourself if you don't believe it
Get up, (Get up!) get back on your feet
You're the one they can't beat, and you know it
Yeah, come on, (Come on!) let's see what you've got
Just take your best shot and don't blow it
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it
You're killing yourself if you don't believe it
Get up, (Get up!) get back on your feet
You're the one they can't beat, and you know it
Oh, come on, (Come on!) let's see what you've got
Just take your best shot and don't blow it
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh oh ohEmbed
