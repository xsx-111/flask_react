Superstars LyricsYou and I
We will climb so high
We'll be superstars
Whoa whoa you and I
See you've read about me in the papers
You've seen me on the movie screen
You know everything there is to know about me
I'm your late night fantasy
But don't think I can't hear you calling
From the shadow of the 14th row
'Cause I've had the same dreams you've had
Just a few short years ago and that's why I know
You and I
We will climb so high
We'll be superstars
Whoa whoa you and I
We'll just close our eyes
We'll become our fantasy

Superstars, superstars, superstars
Superstars yes, yes, superstars
Step right this way, everyone's welcome
We want your dreams
The offer's simple, momentary immortality, my love
'Cause I've seen them all you know
I've seen them climb and I've seen them fall
I've seen them come and I've seen them go
And through it all there's only one thing that matters love
And that's simply you and I
Yes, you and I for we are superstars
You and I, superstars
You and I, superstars
You and I, superstars
