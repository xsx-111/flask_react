Castle Walls Lyrics
Once in a dream far beyond these castle walls
Down near the bay where the moonlit water falls
I stood alone while the minstrel sang his song
So afraid I'd lost my soul

There in the fog his song kept calling me
Leading me on with its haunting melody
Deep in my heart a voice kept echoing
I knew I'd soon be wandering

Far beyond these castle walls
Where the distant harbor meets the sky
There the battle raged like hell
And every dove there lost its will to fly

Far beyond these castle walls
Where I thought I heard Tiresias say
"Life is never what it seems
And every man must meet his destiny"Embed
