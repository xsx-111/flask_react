Mayfly (The Reflex Revision) LyricsIn the midnight
Can you hear me?
In the madness
Ooh, can you see me?
Mmm, I am waiting
Like a mayfly
It's a cold night
For a May time
In the moonlight
Is there no sign?
Mmm, I am waiting
Like a mayfly
Cold and lonely
Waiting for daylight
As the mayfly
As the mayfly
Take me back there again
Let me feel the same way
As I always used to say
While there’s still time, mmm
While there's still time, mmm
I am waiting
Oh, I am waiting
Yeah, I keep waiting
Waiting for daylight
As the mayfly
As the mayfly
Take me back there again
Let me feel the same way
As I always used to say
While there's still time, mmm
But as I grow every day
Tryna switch off the rain
And join hands in the joy we felt
While there’s still time, mmm
While there's still time, mmm
Oh, endless sleep
Perchance to dream
As a mayfly
Oh, endless sleep
Perchance to dream
As a mayfly
Mmm, as a mayfly
Mmm, as a mayflyEmbed
