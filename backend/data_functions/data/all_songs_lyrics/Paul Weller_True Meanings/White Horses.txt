White Horses LyricsWhy be the bully now in my dreams?
Whenever life falls on me
Let's play the way we were, my love
If there's another life to sow
You're still my little girl
And my special boy
Today we hope to sing
Where does the willow
Learn to grow?
Gift all the treasures
You befall
Hey, let it go
In love's special hold
To dream is to
Let us see through it all
White horses are taking me home
Our love is too faithful to lose
Our baby, our baby is growing
Time flies and it's lonely alone
Hey, you little bird
With your special call
Know we leave
Everything to you
My father told me how to be
Give all the treasures left away
White horses are taking me home
Aw, wild as the wind that does blow
White horses are taking me home
Time flies and it's lonely alone
White horses are taking me home
Don't lay at night
Don't lay at night alone
White horses are taking me home
Wild as the wind that does blowEmbed
