The Soul Searchers LyricsHere's one for the searching soul in the moonlight
It's alright
Head down with a furrowed brow in the deep night
Hey, it's alright
Every night
Every day
And I'm trying to find
The words to say
But I wouldn't want it any other way
Hey, hey
Sleep tight, let tomorrow bring you a new day
It's okay
Head down, let the current take you the long way
It's okay
Every night
Every day
It's all for sale
But it's too late to pay
Still, I wouldn't want it any other way
Hey, hey
So here's one for the searching soul in the moonlight
It's alright
Dream on dedicated and do what you feel like
Hey, it's alright
It's alright
Every night
Every day
I'm a searching soul
For searching's sake
And I wouldn't want it any other way
Hey, hey
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
It's alright
It's alright
A searching soul
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
It's alright
It's alright
It's okay
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
It's okay
A searching soul
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
(I wouldn't want it any other way)
A searching soulEmbed
