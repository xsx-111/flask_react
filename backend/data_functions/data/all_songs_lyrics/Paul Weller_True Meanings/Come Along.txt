Come Along LyricsCome along and be my baby
Though we've only met
I just wanna take you home and
Let nature do the rest
I've been watching you awhile
Put me to the test
Wondering what is going on
Underneath that dress
Watcha say
Let's just play
We got time
Let's just see
Where this leads
And say goodnight to everything
Chances, chances everywhere
Take my chances, I don't care
Lay me down upon that bed
Let nature do the rest
Watcha say
Come what may
We got life
Let's just see
Where the seeds
Are taking us
To anywhere

Come along and be my baby
Let's just sink or swim
In the morning I'll be gone and
You'll go back to him
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-laEmbed
