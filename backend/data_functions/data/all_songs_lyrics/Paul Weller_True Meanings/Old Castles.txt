Old Castles LyricsMoonbeams and twilight
Sit by the fireside and glow
Casting grand shadows
All on the meadows below
But the old king is quiet
Looks into the fire, I think he knows
That his bubble has burst, and what's worse
Is now it shows
His old world is changing
But he don't notice at all
His kingdom is crumbling
But he can't see it and so, oh
Some kings just don't care
Happy just to stare and stare
And bad things will happen
That cause old castles to fall
He could have done something
Inspired a tired old Earth
Done something good, done something right
With which the people could unite and grow
For their old world is changing
But they don't notice at all
Their kingdoms are crumbling
But they can't see it and so, oh
Some kings just can't say no
They'll take till there's nothing to grow
And bad things will happen
That cause old castles to fall
For its roots are rotten
Its old walls and all
And bad things happen
That cause old castles
Cause old castles
Cause old castles to fall
