Bowie LyricsDo you know there's no journey?
We're arriving and departing all the time
You were just mortal like me
God is only just a melody
Make the best of every moment
We are not evolving
Or going anywhere
And it's fine
How can the world lose his name?
Everyone is bawling again
Burn the cross or leave it
Look above, you'll see me
We miss you everywhere
Awaken all the ghosts in your mind
Speak of all the good that you find
Live and learn that life is not unkind
Understand the demons that you fight
I know it just seems cold to leave see
We all have to go
Believe me
But letting go
Is thanking youEmbed
