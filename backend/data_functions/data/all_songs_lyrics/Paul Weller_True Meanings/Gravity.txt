Gravity LyricsGolden lions in Golden Square
Salutations fill the air
Oh, gravity
It follows me
Wherever I go
Find the child inside of me
This rusty key will set him free
Oh, gravity
It follows me
Wherever I go
Singing high, singing low
Send an arrow to your heart
Pierce your lips
With a thousand kisses
Pinch a pocket, learn to tie
I don't care if you'll stay mine
My gravity
Stay close to me
Wherever I go

In my heart you'll always be
The greatest love that I could feel
Oh, gravity
Stay close to me
Wherever I go1Embed
