Glide LyricsGlide, glide
Through a portal to my youth
Where the stillness of silence
Brought its undisputed truth
When the anchor of kindness
Held you safe in someone's arms
And all the fears that kept you awake
At night were strangely calmed
Try, try
See the memories unfold
Don't leave me waiting
In this place so strange and cold
Upon my arrival
In this dark and lonely world
Where I glide, glide way up high

Try, try
See the memories unfold
Don't leave me waiting
In this place so strange and cold
Upon my arrival
In this dark and lonely world
Where I glide, glide way up highEmbed
