May Love Travel With You Lyrics
Wherever your mind wanders
While combing through the years
May love travel with you
Forever and without fear

Have grace to see the virtues
Give thanks to them sometimes
And love travel with you
Forever and all time

To a time
There's no pitchers or batters
Only fine lines
All the geometry
And the grand design
While inside the wonders
Of a science so divine
What is there to change?


To a time
There's no pitchers or batters
Only fine lines
All the geometry
And the grand design
While inside the wonders
Of a science so divine
What is there to change?
Hold steady in the twilight
While facing down the years
May love travel with you
Forever and all timeEmbed
