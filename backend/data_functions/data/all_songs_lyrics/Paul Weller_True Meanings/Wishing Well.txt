Wishing Well LyricsIf I had come along
Given all to chance
If I'd waited for ya
In the wandering rain
There's a girl down a wishing well
Throw down my change
I'm not the one you want
In the wandering rain
Strip all my layers off tonight
Wait for the smoke to go tonight
Give me hope of a brand new day
Fill my soul again
Leave me all your sorrow
In the wandering rain
There's a girl in the wishing well
Sacrifice my eye
I'm not the ghost you call
In the wandering rain
In the wheat field, play in the sun
That's where I'm heading to
Just to walk all along that shore
Feel the sun beam on my face
Find a way to find another
And if you don't know
You'll see
Find a way to grow the garden
You did it before, my darling
Beautiful rose, can't you see?
Look at all you can be
To me
Strip all my layers off tonight
Wait for the smoke to go tonight
Strip all my layers off tonight
Wait for the smoke to go tonight
You can find a way to know
This life's worth living
Skip along and play some more
This love I'm givingEmbed
