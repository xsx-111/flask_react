Movin On LyricsI got the key to my heart
I don't need nothing else
I watch the evening sky
Oh, and it's painting itself
There's such colours and shade
To help my mind reappraise
Its simple beauty unfolds
It struck me deep in my bones
I'm movin on
The moment finally has come
Like a pebble that's thrown
So deep and unknown
So deep in me too
This feeling will do
That I, I'm movin on
I've got love all around
I don't need nothing else
I watch the evening sky
Oh, and it's painting itself
This feeling's strong
You have to go and
Count the cost
Thru' the heartaches and pain
Thru' the darkness again
Till you find yourself back
In the light once again
To show-
You're movin on
I watch the evening sky
And it's painting itself
I'm movin on
The ocean I see in one drop
Like a pebble that's thrown
Small waves from me grow
Into the big picture
To show
That I, I'm movin on
I've got love all around
I don't need nothing elseEmbed
