What Would He Say? LyricsIf he is watching still
I'd feel ashamed
What would he think of us?
So cold and mean
And cold's not what he was
Nor full of bitter thoughts
None that I could see
Nor kept from me
Let a world go by
What a shame
Is there none left to try to save?
Oh, does nothing change?
Only objects alter
All those high class games at the altar
What's inside is nothing, what a waste

In a world full of pain
Why add to it?
When there's none left to blame
You gotta face up to it
Oh, does nothing change?
Only objects alter
All those high class games at the altar
What's inside is nothing, what a waste
Stumbling down a street
Tied at two left feet
Those days so far away
What would he say?
That we've no patience now
We've gone too far
And it only takes a spark
To start a war

Oh
