Yes Lyrics
When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line
My back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool
Of us in the daylight

There we were dying of frustration
Saying, "Lord lead me not into temptation"
But it’s not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone

If you’d only, if you’d only say yes
Whether you will's anybody’s guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I’m just so tired of this loneliness

Hey!

So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming "Let the windows down!"
As I crumble to the ground
If you'd only if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness
I've become so tired of this loneliness8Embed
