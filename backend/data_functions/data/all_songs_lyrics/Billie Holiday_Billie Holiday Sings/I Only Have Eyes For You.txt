I Only Have Eyes For You LyricsAre the stars out tonight?
I don't know if its cloudy or bright
Cause I only have eyes for you
The moon may be high
Maybe, millions of people go by
But I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you
I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue
You are here, so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only got eyes, big bulging eyes
Great big eyes for youEmbed
