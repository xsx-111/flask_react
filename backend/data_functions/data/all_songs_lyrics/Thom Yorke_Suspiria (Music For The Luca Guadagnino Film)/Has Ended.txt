Has Ended Lyrics
I woke up in a city
The soldiers had come home
The ego it had ended
His loud mouth was gone

The witches all were singing
And the water turned grey
And the mirrors and the phones
Caught flame, caught flame

Saying we won’t make this mistake again

Then the idiot was alone, was alone
And the water, it forgave us
And the fascists felt ashamed
At their dancing puppet king

Saying we won’t make this mistake again3Embed
