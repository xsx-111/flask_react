Placeholder Lyrics
This body's closed until further notice
Wandering too close will get you nowhere fast
I'm looking for an option that won't involve you at all
Some help to hoist my sail off of its mast

And its haunting me, but I feel fine
War of worlds in real time
Better off signing a truce that's drawn up in your name
But I hope you go home and admit you
Were wrong for the stress you put me through
Free me from the anchor
Depart these seas and let me do what I have to do

Am I so wrong to think that you are too?
Is it safe to be a pawn
When all the rooks close in on you
I used to be afraid of time before I grew
The sands will slip and the pain will grip
And the guilt will trip all over you

And its haunting me, but I feel fine
War of worlds in real time
Better off signing a truce that's drawn up in your name
But I hope you go home and admit you
Were wrong for the stress you put me through
Free me from the anchor
Depart these seas and let me do what I have to
Running around in circles
The path I always choose
I hate that I can't accept anything more
Than the worn out soles of my shoes
Just say something back
And cut me some slack
Headstrong in the world
With the wind at my back
Running around in circles
The path I always choose
I hate that I can't accept anything more
Than the worn out soles of my shoes
Just say something back
And cut me some slack
Headstrong in the world
With the wind at my back9Embed
