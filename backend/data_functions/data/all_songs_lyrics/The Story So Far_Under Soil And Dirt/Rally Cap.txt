Rally Cap LyricsI should have told you, when we were younger
Talk quenches thirst but does nothing for hunger
And I'm starving, it's been like this for three years now
They tell me take it easy but I don't know how
I've got nothing in common with anything, anymore
I've got nothing in common with anything, anymore
I don't have any place to stay but I wouldn't advise the risk
You leave me in the deep end with ankles made of bricks
But I'm used to dealing with crooks and pricks
They fill the minutes while the clock ticks
I don't have any place to stay but I wouldn't advise the risk
(I've got nothing in common)
You leave me in the deep end with ankles made of bricks
(with anything, anymore)
But I'm used to dealing with crooks and pricks
They fill up the minutes while the clock, it ticks
(I've got nothing in common with anything, anymore.)
I should have told you, when we were younger
Talk quenches thirst but does nothing for hunger
And I'm starving, it's been like this for three years now
They tell me take it easy but I don't know how
I've got nothing in common with anything, anymore
I've got nothing in common with anything, anymore
Self medicate cause I'm sick (I've got nothing in common)
Of cutting ties much too thick (With anything anymore)
Please make this painless and quick
Please make this painless and quick
