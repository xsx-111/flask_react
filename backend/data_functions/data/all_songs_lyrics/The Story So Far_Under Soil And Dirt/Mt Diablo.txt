Mt Diablo Lyrics
Everything about you is somebody else
You're a product of environment and middle class wealth
And sleeping that much won't improve your health
Your interest in me is like dust on the shelf
Easy to brush off despite your mood
Call me a liar I'll show you a fake
My old man told me to think on my own
And I'm sure that's your biggest mistake

Watch the sunrise over Mt. Diablo
If you even bother getting dressed today
You'll avert your eyes neglect the skies
I hate it when you act that way
I miss the old you the one I used to talk to
The one who kept her judgements at bay

Will I ever see you again will I ever see you
And if you cut out scheduled time you'll find piece of mind
Trust me its worth your weight in gold
And if you think you're fine go ahead follow that line
At least none of my friends do what they're told
By what they're sold
Do you look yourself straight in the eyes
And think about who you let between your thighs?
Cut the shit be real with me
You're the only one I ever fucking judge
The one who came to school every day
Woke up for the world, practiced honesty
Her business was hers

Will I ever see you again will I ever see you
And if you cut out scheduled time you'll find piece of mind
Trust me its worth your weight in gold
And if you think you're fine go ahead follow that line
At least none of my friends do what they're told
By what they're sold

And if you cut out scheduled time you'll find piece of mind
Trust me its worth your weight in gold
And if you think you're fine go ahead follow that line
At least none of my friends do what they're told
By what they're sold
Will I ever see you again will I ever see you
And if you cut out scheduled time you'll find piece of mind
Trust me its worth your weight in gold
And if you think you're fine go ahead follow that line
At least none of my friends do what they're told
By what they're sold7Embed
