Roam Lyrics
Give up and go home
Alone, and suffer some more
This head of stone lets no one in anymore
Cause my effort is never enough
I'll start unpacking all of my stuff
Cause I've come to know my place
So let's wreck everything I've built except the base

You have no idea how unproductive it is
To fall in and out of you as often as I do
And lately I've been feeling grey but today
I'm alright no thanks to you

Think I'll go and roam outside your boundary
Walk on the ridge. Far away from the city
Friends of friends prove untrustworthy
Be gone, just like you were at the last party
No SOS until the bottles are empty

Now my hunger isn't wasted anymore
Cause I'm younger but I'm tired and I'm sore
I know where you've been
You’re ruining men
Never again will I let someone in
I know where you've been
You’re ruining men
Never again will I let someone in
You have no idea how unproductive it is
To fall in and out of you as often as I do
And lately I've been feeling grey but today
I'm alright no thanks to you
You have no idea how unproductive it is
To fall in and out of you as often as I do
And lately I've been feeling grey but today
I'm alright no thanks to you8Embed
