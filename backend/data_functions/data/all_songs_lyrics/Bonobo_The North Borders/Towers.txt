Towers Lyrics
You were here for a while
You come to me, docile
Tried to make sense of this

By the time that I expressed
That I had felt helpless
You had turned away from me

I’m in this silence
Erasing towers
I’m walking over

I'm in this burning
A kindness searching
I’m walking over

I’m in this silence
Erasing towers
I’m walking over

You were gone days and nights
Empty spaces, no light
Tried to find peace in this
Looking at those times
So obvious you lied
Saw you hide away from me

I’m in this silence
Erasing towers
I’m walking over

I'm in this burning
A kindness searching
I’m walking over

I’m in this silence
Erasing towers
I’m walking over2Embed
