Heaven For The Sinner Lyrics
We don't need no truth, got plenty
Now it grows on trees
God, I'm glad it's not a race, I'd lose
There's no saint, and there's no sinner
Done more dirt than me
Another who can do more right than me
I need to find a paradise for me

When we want it, we just ask it
God is ready, but you don’t want it
So they tell me, Heaven's waiting for the sinner
God is ready, when you’re ready

World keeps turning
Shine your light
Shine, shine

So they tell me, Heaven's waiting for the sinner
God is ready, when you’re ready
Shine

When we want it, we just ask it
God is ready, when you’re ready
But you don’t want it, God is ready
So they tell me, Heaven's waiting for the sinner
God is ready, when you’re ready
Shine, shine
So they tell me, Heaven's waiting for the sinner
God is ready, when you’re ready
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine

So they tell me, Heaven's waiting for the sinner
God is ready, when you’re ready
