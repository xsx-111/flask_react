First Fires Lyrics
How do you see if the dream is gone?
Fading fires, moving on
Why do you need it, when the waves come?
Over you, to undertow

Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Like the first fires
Running for defences, you don't have to pretend
In the first fires

And if you can find it, don't let go
Hold it tight, keep it close
Don't even fight it, when the leaves fall
Over me, this heavy load

Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Like the first fires
Running for defences, you don't have to pretend
In the first fires

And all your memories are caught in the wind
Of the first fires
Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Like the first fires
Like the first fires
Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Honestly, I can't believe it's burning again
Like the first fires2Embed
