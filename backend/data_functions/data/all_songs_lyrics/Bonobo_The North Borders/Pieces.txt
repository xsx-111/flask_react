Pieces Lyrics
Love is in the eyes of the beholder, I
Used to keep a lighthouse lit for you
Hoping there’s a chance you would stay sober and
Find your way back home without the booze

In this deep hole of shame
I’ve got secrets buried
In this deep hole of shame
There is no one to call

Love is in the eyes of the beholder, I’ve
Kept the clouds at distance from the blue
Hoping there’s a chance we’d change it over
(We were fighting but its over now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)
Picking up the pieces and make do
(Once so reckless but I’m older now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)

Love is in the eyes of the beholder, I
(We were fighting but its over now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)
Used to keep a lighthouse lit for you
(Once so reckless but I’m older now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)
Hoping there’s a chance you would stay sober but
(We were fighting but its over now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)
It’s not up to me to guide you through
(Once so reckless but I’m older now)
(Picking pieces off the ground)
Picking pieces
Picking pieces
Picking pieces
Picking pieces off the ground

Picking pieces
Picking pieces
Picking pieces
Picking pieces off the ground1Embed
