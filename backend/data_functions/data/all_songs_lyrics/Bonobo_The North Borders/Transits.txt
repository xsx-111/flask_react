Transits Lyrics
You’ll never know
Only my soul
Bares the truth
Cares for you
Only my soul

You’ll never see
Stays here with me
Overload, nothing more
Only my soul

Knew you were ready
Cause you had no answers for me

Knew you were ready
Cause you had no answers for me

Knew you were ready
I knew you were, knew you were
Cause you had no answers for me
Knew you were ready
I knew you were, knew you were
'Cause you had no answers for me

Take me back to where love grows
Because I don't want to be here anymore

Take me back to where love grows
I don't want to be here anymoreEmbed
