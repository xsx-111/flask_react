Friends Of Mine Lyrics
Friends of mine
They said they were friends of mine
Said they were passing time
More like a waste of time
Close the door
I said close the door
I've told you twice before
What are you waiting for?

Georgie Davis is coming out
No more heroes we twist and shout
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late
And I know that I'm not taking anymore
Rocky Picture has lost his gun
Leave him out now he's having fun
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late
And I know that I'm not waiting anymore, hey, hey

Silly lies
Don't have to advertise
When will you realize?
I'm sick of your alibis
Running cold
The water's running cold
It's time that you were told
I think you're growing old

Georgie Davies is coming out
No more heroes we twist and shout
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late
And I know that I'm not waiting anymore
Rocky Picture has lost his gun
Leave him out now he's having fun
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late
And I know that I'm not taking any more (hey, hey)

I see you smile
Pictures on the wall, they're all friends of mine
See you standing 'round the back (friends of mine)
Think yourself lucky

Friends of mine
They said they were friends of mine
They were just wasting time
Out on the dotted line
Oh, money's gone
I've known it all along
Why don't you say I'm wrong?
Why don't they drop the bomb?

'Cause Georgie Davies is coming out
No more heroes we twist and shout
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late
And I know that I'm not waiting anymore
Rocky Picture's thrown away his gun
Leave him out now he's having fun
Oh no, not me, I'm not too late
And I know that I'm not taking any more

What you doing, friends of mine?
Holding back now, friends of mine
I've always heard you calling2Embed
