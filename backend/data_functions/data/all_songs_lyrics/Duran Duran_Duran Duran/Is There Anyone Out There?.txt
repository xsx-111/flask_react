Is There Anyone Out There? Lyrics
I never found out what made you leave
Another day's over just an hour to go
Well I tried to phone last night but you never answered
Just left me ringing on the line

Outside is there anyone out there anyone else outside
Woah outside love is there anyone out there anyone else outside

My face in the mirror shows a break in time
A crack in the ocean, it does not align
I tried to sleep last night, but I've caught ya dreaming
About days we used to wonder away


Look out of the window maybe you can call by my name
Another night over babe another light comes on in vain
Well I tried to phone last night but you never answered
You just left me ringing in the air
