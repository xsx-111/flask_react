Night Boat Lyrics
Standing on the edge of a quay
Low lights flashing on the water for me
Fogging my mind darkens my eyes
Silently streaming for a distant sound
Ripple river yellows
Rising for a breath of breeding and drowns
Stillness overcomes me in the night
Listen to the rising water moan

I'm waiting
Waiting for the night bo-oh-oat
I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat

Shudders all through me shudder away
Echo me, echo me (echo me...)
Am I alone or is the river alive
'Cause it echos me, echos me, echos me

I'm waiting
Waiting for the night bo-oh-oat
I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat
Waiting
Waiting for the night bo-oh-oat
I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat
Waiting for the night bo-oh-oat
I'm waiting
Waiting for the night boat

I'm waiting for the night boat4Embed
