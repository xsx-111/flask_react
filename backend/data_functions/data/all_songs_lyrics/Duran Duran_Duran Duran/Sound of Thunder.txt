Sound of Thunder Lyrics
I've been in this grass here
For the last ten hours
My clothes are dirty
But my mouth isn't dry
How does it happen?
Does it fly through the air?
Woah I gave up asking days away
I gave up asking days away

And now I'm lying here
Waiting for the sound of thunder
Waiting for the sound of thunder

Here I am, I'm a dotted line
Cut the corners, tick me to your door
I'm the man who stepped off the path
And I just lie here
It's what I was made for

And now my eyes are closing
But I still feel the land
Leaning out for the touch of my hand
The world spins so fast
That I might fly off
The world spins so fast
That I might fly off
The world spins so fast
I might fly off
Waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunder
I'm waiting for the sound of thunderEmbed
