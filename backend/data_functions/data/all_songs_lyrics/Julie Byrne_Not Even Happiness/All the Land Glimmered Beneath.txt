All the Land Glimmered Beneath LyricsI've been sitting in the garden
Singing to the wind
Searching for an anchor
I've been seeking god within
Well I hold you so dear, my friend
There was a time I called you in the night
When darkness lived in me
And sleep it was not near
I called you so late and you answered me
Lover, I know it is not easy
You must speak out from your depth
And might our fire burn long, might I love you more
Even more than I did before
Will I know a truer time
Than when I stood alone in the snow
And the moon was in the sky and it shone
And all the land glimmered beneath
And I was in my heart, I answered me
I've been sitting in the garden
I've been singing to the wind
I've been searching for an anchor
I've been seeking god withinEmbed
