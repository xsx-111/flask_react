I Live Now As A Singer LyricsThere ain’t no use fighting for me
My heart ain’t in the ring for you
Blue palms glide in the light of a red moon
The Catalinas brought me to the West
And yes I have broke down asking for forgiveness
When I was nowhere close to forgiving myself
And I have dragged my lives across the country
And wondered if travel led me anywhere
There's a passion in me, just does not long for those things
Tell me how'd it feel for you to be here now
At night beneath the universe you walk with me
Shall I be ever near the edge of your mystery1Embed
