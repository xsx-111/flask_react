Sea as It Glides LyricsThe day has been melting away
We've been lying on the shore for a while
And our sun is still
And you are the sea as it glides
You are the sea as it glides
In the kingdom of twilight
In spirit and life
Heat carries across me on the breeze
And the stars are well where they are
For those who belong to them
Yet I carried my burdens where I'd go
And if not I may have ran forever
Leaving fire in my wake
Leaving fire in my wake
You are the sea as it glidesEmbed
