Follow My Voice Lyrics
Follow my voice
I am right here
Beyond this light
Beyond all fear

The clouds are passing by on by, my darling
Your eyes are breathing
I've seen them in the light

I consciously died
I've seen dew on a rose
I've seen a double rainbow
I got a complicated soul
To me, this city's hell
But I know you call it home
I was made for the green
Made to be alone

The clouds are passing by on by, my darling
Your eyes are breathing
I've seen them in the light
And I couldn't let it go
No matter how hard I was trying
The clouds are passing by

I've been called heartbreaker
For doing justice to my own
I, too, been a fault-finder
But that life is broke
How I love you
You're the one my heart chose
And so I will be here
And so I will be here

Beyond this light
Beyond all fear
Beyond this love
Beyond all fear

The clouds are passing by on by, my dear
Your eyes are breathing
I've seen them in the light2Embed
