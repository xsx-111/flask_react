Natural Blue Lyrics
Back on tour
Driving through southwestern towns
That I had been in before
Sun split ember, and fields that span
Forever, forever
Forever

And when I first saw you
The sky, it was such a natural blue
The sky, it was such a natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue

Stars over a back porch
They're talking but I, I don't say much anymore
It's old news but if you're asking
Been a long time since I...
Since I've been moved

But when I first saw you
That feeling, it came over me too
That feeling, it came over me too
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Chicory burns grass at your knees
Walk forward from your open wound
Live in dreams, I'll remain forever
Inside the colors you've shown...
You've shown to me

And when I first saw you
The sky, it was such a natural blue
The sky, it was such a natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
Natural blue
