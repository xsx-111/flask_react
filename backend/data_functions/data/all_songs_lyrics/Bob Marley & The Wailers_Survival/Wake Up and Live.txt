Wake Up and Live Lyrics
One, two, three, four

Wake up and live, you all
Wake up and live
Wake up and live now
Wake up and live

Life is one big road with lots of signs
So when you riding through the ruts, don't you complicate your mind
Flee from hate, mischief and jealousy
Don't bury your thoughts, put your vision to reality, yeah
All together now

Wake up and live, you all
Wake up and live
Wake up and live now
Wake up and live

Rise
You mighty people, yeah
There's work to be done
So let's do it a little by little
Rise
From your sleepless slumber!
Yes, yeah! Yes, yeah
We're more than sand on the seashore
We're more than numbers
All together now
Wake up and live, you all
Wake up and live
Wake up and live now
Wake up and live

You see, one, one cocoa full a basket
Whey they use you live big today, tomorrow you buried in a casket
One, one cocoa full a basket
Yeah, yes
Whey they use you live big today, tomorrow you bury in a casket
What? together now

Wake up and live, you all
Wake up and live
Wake up and live now
Wake up and live
Wake up and live, you all
Wake up and live
Wake up and live now
Wake up and live
Break it down

Come on, man!
How is it feeling over there
(Wake up and live now) All right
(Wake up and live!) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh!
Come on, man
You got to wake up and live
Life is one big road in hands of time
So when you ride into the rust don't you complicate your mind
Free from the hate yeah
And even jealousy
Come bury your thought put your dreams to reality yeah
All together now

Wake up and live, you all
Wake up and live
Wake up and live now
Wake up and live
Wake up and live, you all
Wake up and live
Wake up and live now
Wake up and liveEmbed
