One Drop Lyrics
Feel it in the one drop
And we'll still find time to rap
We're making the one stop
The generation gap
Now feel this drumbeat
As it beats within
Playing a rhythm
Resisting against the system, ooh-wee!

I know Jah never let us down
Pull your rights from wrong
(I know Jah would never let us down)
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

They made their world so hard (so hard)
Every day we got to keep on fighting (fighting)
They made their world so hard (so hard)
Every day the people are dying (dying), yeah
(Dread, dread) For hunger (it dread, dread) and starvation
(Dread, dread, it dread, oh dread) Lamentation
But read it in Revelation (Dread, dread, it dread, dread)
(Dread, dread) You'll find your redemption
And then you give us the teachings of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy
A-you give us the teachings of His Majesty
A-we no want no devil philosophy

Feel it in the one drop
And we'll still find time to rap
We're making the one stop
And we're filling the gap
So feel this drumbeat
As it beats within
Playing a rhythm
Fighting against -ism and schism, singing

I know Jah never let us down
Pull your rights from wrong
I know Jah never let us down
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

They made their world so hard
Every day (we got to keep on fighting) every day!
They made their world so hard
Every day (the people are dying) eh!
(Dread, dread, it dread, dread) A-what make dem a-go on so?
(Dread, dread, it dread, oh dread) A-what!
(Dread, dread, it dread) A-what! (dread)
A-what frighten them? (Dread, dread)
A-what frighten them? Eh!
Give us the teachings of His Majesty, this is a stick up!
We no want no devil philosophy, can you hear?
Give us the teachings of His Majesty
For we no want no devil philosophy

We feel it in the one drop
You're lucky, for we'll still got time to rap
And we're making the one stop, let me tell ya
This generation gap
Now feel this drumbeat, tell you what
As it's beating within4Embed
