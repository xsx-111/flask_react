Babylon System Lyrics
We refuse to be
What you wanted us to be
We are what we are
That's the way (way) it's going to be, if you don't know
You can't educate us
For no equal opportunity
(Talking about my freedom) Talking about my freedom
People freedom (freedom) and liberty

Yeah, we've been trodding on the winepress much too long
Rebel, rebel
Yes, we've been trodding on the winepress much too long
Rebel, rebel

Babylon system is the vampire, yeah (vampire)
Sucking the children day by day, yeah
I say, the Babylon system is the vampire, falling empire
Sucking the blood of the sufferers, yea-ea-ah
Building church and university, wooh, yeah
Deceiving the people continually, yea-ah
I say they are graduating thieves and murderers
Look out now, they are sucking the blood of the sufferers (sufferers)
Yea-ea-eah! (Sufferers)
Tell the children the truth
Tell the children the truth
Tell the children the truth right now
Come on and tell the children the truth
Tell the children the truth
Tell the children the truth
Tell the children the truth
Come on and tell the children the truth

'Cause, 'cause we've been trodding on your winepress much too long
Rebel, rebel
And we've been taken for granted much too long
Rebel, rebel, now
Trodding on the winepress
We've got to rebel, y'all
Yeah we've been trodding on the winepress much too long, yeah4Embed
