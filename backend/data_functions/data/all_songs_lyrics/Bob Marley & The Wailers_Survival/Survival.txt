Survival Lyrics
(Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow!
Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care
That you care
When every time I look around
The people suffer in the suffering
In every way, in everywhere

Say, na-na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na!)
We're the survivors
Yes, the Black survivors

I tell you what, some people got everything
Some people got nothing
Some people got hopes and dreams
Some people got ways and means

Like Daniel out of the lions' den
(Black survivors) Survivors, survivors

So I Idren, I sistren
Which way will we choose
We better hurry, oh, hurry, oh, hurry, whoa, now
Because we got no time to lose

Some people got facts and claims
Some people got pride and shame
Some people got the plots and schemes
Some people got no aim it seems


Like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
(Black survivors)
Thrown in the fire, but-a never get burn
So I Idren, I-sistren
The preaching and talking is done
We've gotta live up, wo now, wo now!
Because the Father's time has come
Some people put the best outside
Some people keep the best inside
Some people can't stand up strong
Some people won't wait for long


In this age of technological inhumanity (Black survival)
Scientific atrocity (survivors)
Atomic mis-philosophy (Black survival)
Nuclear mis-energy (survivors)
It's a world that forces lifelong insecurity (Black survival)
All together now


A good man is never honoured (survivors)
In his own country (Black survival)
Nothing change, nothing strange (survivors)
Nothing change, nothing strange (Black survivors)
We got to survive, you all! (survivors)1Embed
