Ride Natty Ride Lyrics
Dready got a job to do
And he's got to fulfill that mission
To see his hurt is their greatest ambition
But we will survive in this world of competition
Because no matter what they do
Natty keep on coming through
And no matter what they say
Natty do them every day
Natty Dread rides again
Through the mystics of tomorrow
Natty Dread rides again
Have no fear, have no sorrow

All and all you see a-gwan
Is to fight against Rastaman
So they build their world on great confusion
To force on us the devil's illusion
But the stone that the builder refuse
Shall be the head cornerstone
And no matter what game they play
We got something they could never take away
We got something they could never take away

And it's the fire, it's the fire
That's burning down everything
Feel the fire, fire
Only the birds have their wings
No time to be deceived
Oh, brothers, you should know and not believe
Jah say this judgement - it could never be with water
No water can put out this fire
This fire, this fire, this fire
A yaga y'all! Ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there
Because now the fire is out of control
Panic in the city, wicked weeping for their gold
Everywhere this fire is burning
Destroying and melting their gold
Destroying and wasting their souls
Ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there

Tell you what: now the people gather on the beach
And the leader try to make a speech
But the Dreadies understanding that it's too late
Fire is burning
Man, pull your own weight
Fire is burning
Man, pull your own weight
Natty Dread rides again
And me saying Go there, Dready
Oh ride, Natty, ride
And go there, Dready
Riding through the storm
Riding through the calm

Oh ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there2Embed
