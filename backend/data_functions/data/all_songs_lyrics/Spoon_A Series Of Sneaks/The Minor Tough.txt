The Minor Tough LyricsI want to settle this bet and I don't want your shoulder instead
The minor tough's walking past again
A pure extension, yeah
Reach in your pocket and pull out the pant leg of hate
Reach in your pocket and pull out the pant leg of hate
The hardcore will tell me not to say so
But now, Kiara, where'd your sadness go?
You know I would go try and get through to you
If you weren't down at The Back Room
They're standing up the block and down the street
And they'll be out all night, yeah
As I'm out in the car, it comes to me
They're breaking up inside1Embed
