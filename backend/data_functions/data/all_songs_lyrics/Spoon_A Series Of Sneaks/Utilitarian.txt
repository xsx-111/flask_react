Utilitarian LyricsCatacomb, catacomb
Be my security
Count it off, count it off
Be my big sister
I walked forty-six blocks
You've been putting it off but come on
I've got meat in my arms
I've got steel in my teeth, so come on
Making out, taking out
It's utilitarian
Heartache, adulate
It's utilitarian
Oh yeah, we're in love with this perverted world, yeah, come on
When I walk down the steps, I'm just halfway across the world
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah!Embed
