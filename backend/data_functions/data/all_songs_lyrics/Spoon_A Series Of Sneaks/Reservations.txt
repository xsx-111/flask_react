Reservations LyricsHe couldn't answer my...
He couldn't answer my...
He couldn't answer my reservations, no
He couldn't answer my...
He couldn't answer my...
He couldn't answer and I
One little answer
A cheap little answer
Would have meant so much, I
Some kind of response now
Some cheap little answer would've done it for me
And she's never been in the places she oughta
But that doesn't stop her being around
And she's never been in the places that she oughta
She's just a miner's daughter
She's been around but she...
She's been around but she...
She's been around but she's never made it
She's been around with you...
She's been around but she...
She's been around but she's never one to give you reservations
And it's why, oh
Yeah, she's so realized yet uncalculated all of the timeEmbed
