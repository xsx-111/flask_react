The Guestlist / The Execution LyricsReach for a drink when you're in cola land
It may be just what you need but it's never enough
And now, we're sending out but it's never enough
Just what you need but it's never enough
We're sending out but it's never enough
It's just the last time you'll get the truth in
I'm on the guest list / the execution
Reach for a drink when you're in cola land
It may be just the last time you'll get the truth in
I'm on the guest list / the executionEmbed
