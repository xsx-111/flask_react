Advance Cassette LyricsGetting caught has made me think it over
And it told me that you're never coming back here again
We've been doing things the same way for so long
That it took me aback
But I don't think I'll ever hear that sad song again
Don't tell me I've lost you
Advance cassette
Oh no, I just can't believe it
No, don't say that I've lost you
Advance cassette
Oh no, I just can't believe it
Advance cassette
Advance cassette
Advance cassette, yeah
You'll know by the look on their faces when they pass you
You've been dropped off on the Texas highway
I've been out here now for so long that I'm not sure
How you wound me so tight
I'm afraid I won't ever hear that sad song again
So don't tell me I've lost you
Advance cassette
Oh no, I just can't believe in it
No, don't say that I've lost you
Advance cassette
Oh no, I just can't, can't, can't, can't, can't, can't believe itEmbed
