Quincy Punk Episode LyricsMolly said she ought to leave you
Ought to leave you, ought to leave you
Molly said she ought to leave you
Ought to leave you, ought to leave you
Ought to leave you in the ground
Ought to leave you in the ground
Ought to leave you in the ground
Ought to leave you
Ought to leave you
Ought to leave you
When they see you hanging down from on the ceiling
I've got a feeling
That there's no one, if you could speak, would believe you
I-n-t-h-e-g-r-o-u-n-d, ground
Ought to leave you in the ground
Ought to leave you, alright
Molly said she ought to leave you
Ought to leave you, ought to leave you
Molly said she ought to leave you
Ought to leave you, ought to leave you
Ought to leave you in the ground
Ought to leave you in the ground, yeah
Ought to leave you in the ground
Ought to leave you
Ought to leave you
Ought to leave you
Ought to leave you
Ought to leave youEmbed
