Metal Detektor LyricsMetal detector ringing as I'm walking through the door
With every chance I take, I can feel it start to break
To start to break some more
It's going down some more
I'm gonna break the bank of Texas and walk out
It's a lie no more
All through with playing the wall
I'm gonna break the bank of Dakota and walk right back out
It's going down some more
Not gonna fake it no more
Just gonna break the bank of Texas and walk right out
And make the sound of getting kicked when you're down
I'm gonna break the heart of Chicago and walk right back out
Metal detector ringing as I walk on through the door
Metal detector ringing as I'm walking through the doorEmbed
