Staring at the Board LyricsWhat you knew of me was all sad and deformed
Operator, I'm baked and I'm...
Boy, you better take a look in that box because
Sitting on them couches
Sitting on them floors
Well, it's better that that's done and now you're gone
And the one with you, the first
Is the one you feel the worst about
That's why I'm out in central station and I'm staring at the board
I'm staring at the board at central station, one more timeEmbed
