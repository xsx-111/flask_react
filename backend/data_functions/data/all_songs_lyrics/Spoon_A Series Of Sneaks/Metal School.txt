Metal School LyricsI packed all my things in a nylon bag
I kept my eyes open wide
And got out the day the stock went black
What was so alluring has now faded
And just stylistic and jaded
But I'm just glad to get out of there for metal school
If I could take back what we both assumed
Would you spin it back to me on the lazy sue?
It could exist to be where we found it
And we'd just wrap our fingers around it
That's why I'm going to give it all up
Put all that back and enroll in metal schoolEmbed
