Rocket Rocket Rocketship Lyrics
Exhausted all the things I love
And tortured myself, can I just be happy?
When everybody jumps on everything I said
And everybody's telling me that we're best friends
I'd rather be dead or dying

So someone cut me a check (no, no-no, no)
Cashed for all that I'm worth (no, no-no, no)
And divide it by what I've spent
And calculate my net worth
I never got nothing for anything
I feel I've done everything for nothing

And maybe we can fly away from here
Surf on the debris of a broken scene
Sub-suburban wasteland
Pack up everything and get out of here
Everything I fought for is dead to me
Sub-suburban wasteland

You were wrong, I'll buy the farm tonight
I'd like to spend time where no one can see me
I'm pissing down the cracks of a broken dream
United we can change our whole, whole destiny
Come on, nobody's with me
Just send me off with a check (no, no-no, no)
Cashed for all that I'm worth (no, no-no, no)
And I'll say I feel better
But I'll really feel worse
I never feel like feeling anything
I only feel everything for nothing

And maybe we can fly away from here
Surf on the debris of a broken scene
Sub-suburban wasteland
Pack up everything and get out of here
Everything I fought for is dead to me
Sub-suburban wasteland, oh, oh!


And maybe we can fly away from here
Surf on the debris of a broken scene
Pack up everything and get out of here
Everything I fought for is dead to me
Sub-suburban wasteland

And maybe we can fly away from here
Surf on the debris of a broken scene
Sub-suburban wasteland
Pack up everything and get out of here
Everything I fought for is dead to me
Sub-suburban wasteland, a-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-choo
(We'll break it down while breaking in)
And maybe we can fly away from here
(We'll break it down while breaking in)
Surf on the debris of a broken scene
(We'll break it down while breaking in)
Sub-suburban wasteland, a-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-choo
(We'll break it down while breaking in
We'll break it down while breaking in)
Pack up everything and get out of here
(We'll break it down while breaking in)
Everything I fought for is dead to me
(We'll break it down while breaking in)
Sub-suburban wasteland, a-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-choo
(We'll break it down while breaking in)
We'll break it down while breaking inEmbed
