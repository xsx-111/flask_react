Kill the President Lyrics
What's the bullshit for?
Verbal battlefield, syllables of war
I shut myself off, and it happens again
You're not my friend, you're not my friend
You're not my friend, yeah!

The winter knocked on my door like a selfish bitch
I'm glad that you haven't got your wish
In the cold all alone, I've been thinking of everyone but you
And it feels like seventh grade again, and none of this will ever end
I'm just your public malcontent, another extraneous trend
Don't try to be like me, because I'm not one to compete
To obtain the status of a symbol of idolatry

This time I'd really rather be alone
Can we forget this? so I can just go home
This time I'd really rather be alone

Acting unaffected by this hand of fate
Saying "Everything's okay!" with a straight face
I remember when you said I could count on you for anything
And I still hold on but you'll hold off
And play another dumb charade again
I'm driving my car home and never walking in the rain again
I miss the smell of Taco Bell and places that we knew too well
Driving me crazy, driving me crazy
Driving me crazy, it's driving me crazy
This time I'd really rather be alone
Can we forget this? so I can just go home
This time I'd really rather be alone

I'm bleeding profusely from my insides
While you're smiling cause you're stealing all of my best lines
I'm doubled over, and I'm taking my own side

Over and over again, I'm so useless
Now you're becoming everything
(Well, was I ever anything?)
Everyone I love always leaves me
My judgement's been off every time
(Your words will always still be mine)
This time I'd really rather be alone
Can we forget this? so I can just go home
This time I'd really rather be alone

I'm bleeding profusely from my insides
While you're smiling cause you're stealing all of my best lines
I'm doubled over, and I'm taking my own side
And now, I'll be slapped on crowded streets
And in some lame cry of defeat
I'll open up, I'll shout it loud:
"Fuck that! Turn off the new sound!"
I'll be slapped on crowded streets
And in some lame cry of defeat
I'll open up, I'll shout it loud:
"Fuck that! Turn off the new sound!" (fuck that!)
"Fuck that! Turn off the new sound!" (fuck that!)
"Fuck that! Turn off the new sound"
(One, two, three four)

Over and over again, I'm so useless
Now you're becoming everything
(Well, was I ever anything?)
Everyone I love always leaves me
(My judgement's off this time)
(For the last time, what's left beside me now?)
No one in this world is ever listening
Pay attention now, pay attention no-ow
No one in this world's ever listening (pay attention, pay attention)
(Pay attention, pay attention, pay attention, pay attention now)
Pay attention now, better pay attention now na-now now now
At home alone again all night (at home alone again all night)
Expect the worst and you'll be right


You know what? I'm the biggest star here, man, that's the way it is!Embed
