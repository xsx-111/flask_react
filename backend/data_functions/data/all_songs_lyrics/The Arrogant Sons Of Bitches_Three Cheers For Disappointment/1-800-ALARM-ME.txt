1-800-ALARM-ME Lyrics
Go!

Hey, I woke up today (today)
To think about a dream I had, a dream I left so far away
Ten seconds pass and as I think
Twenty minutes pass, I've failed my mission
I'm a waste of life, a waste of mind, where's my ambition?
Chalk up one girlfriend, two broken cars
My band and friends are nothing more
Than parting shots not taken, look how jaded I can be!

When I turned sixteen
Already felt too old to be in this entire scene
Of sighing lazily at unaccomplished dreams

Yeah, it's my home but I think it's time to go
I'll hit once more so I don't wake up
I got no home and I got nowhere to go
I just can't seem to get on top of this situation normal all fucked up

Still, I lay in bed (in bed)
And think of all the dreams I've had and clever remarks I have said
It seems like they all mean nothing
Snooze, alarm reset, that's eight more minutes
This disaster can't exist because I'm not awake to live it
I can't seem to place where life went wrong
It's the wrong chords, it's one lame song
I never know the exit to get off at 'til it's passed
Kick me in the ass
A free shot, get it over with and kick me until I bleed
It seems that's all you need (let's go!), this one's one me

Yeah, it's my home but I think it's time to go
I'll hit once more so I don't wake up
I got no home and I got nowhere to go
I just can't seem to get on top of this situation normal all fucked up

I don't think I'm going outside today
I'll stay in bed all day, declare a personal holiday
So you can take my page right out of your phone book
Burn my seven digits to ashes
I won't be attending any of your classes
Light another smoke as this day passes

I don't think I'm going outside today
I'll stay in bed all day, declare a personal holiday
So you can take my page right out of your phone book
Burn my seven digits to ashes
I won't be attending any of your classes
Eyelids are the sky as this day passes
I wanna stay asleep forever, I wanna stay asleep forever
I wanna stay asleep forever, I wanna stay asleep forever
I wanna stay asleep forever, I wanna stay asleep forever
I wanna stay asleep forever, I wanna stay asleep forever
(Shoot)

"To you they're children, to me they're dollar signs"
"Oh!"Embed
