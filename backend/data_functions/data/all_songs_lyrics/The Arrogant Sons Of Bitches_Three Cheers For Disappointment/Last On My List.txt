Last On My List Lyrics
I wish I could be mad and break something
I wish they took me instead, you were nothing
Short of all the things I'll never be
You would never be bitter like me
You solved my problems like it was your job
I never thought that one day you'd be gone
Or I'd tell you how much late night talks
Really did mean everything to me

Bad times for everyone today

I only wish this could be your pen across the page
And I only wish this could be a song for you sing
And I only wish that it was me in the car that day
And I only wish that I said goodbye before you went away

Then you could tell me how to get through these days

Miniature golf cannot be played
Once the seasons change, end this summer holiday
I knew the sun would shine again
I didn't know that this one was your last
(One, two, three, four)
The summer started off me pacing in a room
Feeling comfort only seconds long, hoping passerbys were you
Not-so-distant memories
I cried that night cause they took you too soon
Hard times for everyone today

I only wish this could be your pen across the page
And I only wish this could be a song for you sing
And I only wish that it was me in the car that day
And I only wish that I said goodbye before you went away

Like everybody else, I have my own shit list, and
I want to you to know that you were at the bottom of it
Little technicalities and indescribabilities
And I can put my finger on it
Now I'm in this fucking van
Five thousand things I won't forget
Your face, move on again, goodbye

How I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
(I only wish this could be your pen across the page)
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
(And I only wish this could be a song for you sing)
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
(And I only wish)
And how I long to share eternal life with you
That it was me in the car that day
And I only wish that I said goodbye before you went away
Then you could tell me how to get through these days

If we had just another day
We'd have a ball instead of pissing it all away
Three cheers for all those summer days
Hey, hey, yeah!
(And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you
And how I long to share eternal life with you)
