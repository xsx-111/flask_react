Disappointment at the Taco Bell Lyrics
Clock is ticking and my shelf life is up
Clock is ticking and my shelf life is up
Clock is ticking and my shelf life is up

Wrong side of the tracks and wrong side of the fence
Wrong thing that I lack, I lack the common sense
My life, and this is all I know
And I've got no time, I've got no mind, I've got nowhere to go
Can't live in your world of the nine, nine to five
You could get your fifteen minutes and I've got my whole life
My life, and this is all I know
And I've got no time, I've got no mind, I've got nowhere to go

Career tests all came back inconclusive
All that I can give is a half-assed attempt
At being like you, I'm not normal like you

Nothing I can say, I haven't said five thousand times
'Cause you've got your way to live and I've got mine
There's nothing to say, I've said it fifteen thousand times
Kiss it goodnight and kiss me goodbye
You think it never hurts, all the con-confusion
All the itches in my nerves and all the hate in my blood
My blood, this isn't what I need
Occupational conformity won't put my mind at ease, no!
Clock is ticking and my shelf life is up
And all bets have been placed for when the wheel is gonna stop
It's gonna stop, it's gonna, this what I need, yeah yeah
This is life and this is love and this is my release, yeah

Pains my soul to separate like this
I guess that's how it is, I'll leave myself to mine
Our paths can't cross now, I wish I had one more chance now

Nothing I can say, I haven't said five thousand times
'Cause you've got your way to live and I've got mine
There's nothing to say, I've said it fifteen thousand times
Kiss it goodnight and kiss me goodbye

It's been a year or two since we've communicated
So don't tell me you're one for me to trust or believe in
I believe nothing, I will not trust anyone again
Anyone again
I've said it fifteen thousand times

My brain keeps spinning and I still can't give up
I've run far off the course, I guess I'm never gonna stop
This clock keeps ticking, sorry, got no more shelf life for ya, baby
Time bomb's ticking, I'll commence blowing up
I'll construe your rejection as a lack of trust

You won't love me once I'm washed up
I'm all washed up, yeah
And I can't trust no one

There's nothing I can say, I haven't said five thousand times
You've got your way to live and I've got mine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've got mine, yeah (I've got mine)
There's nothing to say, I've said it fifteen thousand times
Kiss it goodnight and kiss me goodbye
Kiss it goodnight, kiss me goodbye
Because I've said it fifteen thousand timesEmbed
