Piss Off Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
P-I-S-S   O-F-F, hey!

I remember way back when, when I wanted you to be mine
And now that I kind of had you, I wonder, was all just a waste of time?
And did it make sense jumping into something knowing that I'd get hurt?
I don't know, but my boss thinks not, it makes me less productive at work

And all my friends told me look out
'Cause you were treating me like
I swallowed my pride and bit my tongue
And I thought nothing of it
I blame the whatevership's termination
On why things are never fine
I dreaded this moment from the day that we met
But I have to say goodbye

Now all I do is drink and smoke with all my friends
I regret not moving on even though I said I did, yeah, blah blah
How many times do I have to call you just because you called me first?
You see, we're nothing together but a bunch of obligations that just make me feel worse
And why was I the last to know
When you ride some other guy?
And why should I have even cared
That night you said you cried?
My stomach threw up my daily nutrition
And your anti-morals robbed me blind
I loved you and you blew it and you broke your own heart
So eat this last goodbye

And all that money we blew on each other
Did it mean so little you could just find another?
To replace me, my whatever, I mean, piss off, go to hell
When can I get over this, stop hating myself?
And as the day goes on I'll find someone better
I'll go it alone and brave the cold weather
Through these blizzard-like conditions, screaming if I'm still alive
Piss off, this is the last goodbye

This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
Woo-oo!
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
This is the last goodbye
Oh, the last goodbye
(Oh!)Embed
