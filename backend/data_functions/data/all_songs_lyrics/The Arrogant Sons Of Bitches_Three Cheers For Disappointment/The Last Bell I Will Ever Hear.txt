The Last Bell I Will Ever Hear Lyrics
Well, I lied
I lied to you again
I said I wanted to be friends
I said that it would never end
But I was out before it began
I bit my nails and wrote away
I had been waiting for the day
That it was the end

The clouds
Grey and covering the sky
Barely let the sun slip by
At about 2:05
Everyone was starting to cry
There's nothing that needs more explaining
You can't run my fucking life anymore!

We're going home tonight to tear your pictures off the wall
And I won't spend another memory waiting for your precious telephone call
I won't be sorry for anything I do
Because I live this life for me, not you

Don't think that I'm gonna call you tomorrow
To remember the days gone past
Five, four, three, two, one, it's over
And you can kiss my ass
And if I never see you again that would be too-Embed
