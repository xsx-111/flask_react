Put on Your White Sombrero Lyrics
Put on your white sombrero
Saddle your horse my dear
And ride off into the sunset
You'd better go for there is no
Place for you here

Like an old fashioned hero
You stand before me
Oh, you think our life is a movie
My world is real I live and feel
And I can do without you


Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandanna too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye my friend, this is the end
For me and you

Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings
I'll cry while you're disappearing
Into the night, all dressed in white
Unchained and free, without me
Put on your white sombrero
Like all the cowboys do
Go find a sweet se√±orita
Somebody meek, who'll never speak
Harshly to you

You're such a caballero
Proud, never bending
I want someone who will take me
Just as I am, I need a man
Who is in rhyme with his time

Oh, you'll never take me
Just as I am, I need a man
Who is in rhyme with his timeEmbed
