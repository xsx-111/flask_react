On Tooting Broadway Station LyricsOn Tooting Broadway station
I knelt down and wept
My hands hit the concrete floor
Until my fingers bled
I will cut him out of my heart
I will leave these tears in pools
Tripped over these pourings
Tripped over his feelings
I've cut him out of my heart
Burn, burn his clothes
Burn everything he owned
And the empty chamber left
I'll carry around as this hollowness
That drags in my voice
Burn, burn it all
Burn, burn it all
Benedictory fire
Blessing of these burns
Burn, burn it all
Burn, burn it all
Benedictory fire
Blessing of these burns
On Tooting Broadway station
I lay down and slept
The concrete for a pillow
Fingers in bandages
I cut him out, I lie here dry
I unstitched the bindweed of love
Burn, burn his clothes
Burn everything he owned
And the empty chamber left
I'll carry around as this hollowness
That drags in my voice
Burn, burn it all
Burn, burn it all
Benedictory fire
Blessing of these burns
Burn, burn it all
Burn, burn it all
Benedictory fire
Blessing of these burns
My John of Arc
My John of Arc
My John of Arc
My John of Arc
Burn, burn it all
Burn, burn it all
Benedictory fire
Blessing of these burns
Give me his charred heart
Give me his fillings
And God, give me God to forgive me
Burn, burn it all
Burn, burn it all
Benedictory fire
Blessing of these burns
My John of Arc
My John of Arc
My John of Arc
Fire, fire, fire, fire
My John of Arc
My John of Arc
My John of Arc
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
My John of ArcEmbed
