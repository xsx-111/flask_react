4 Men Lyrics
Stars are falling down
Onto this broken-hearted hungry clown
Because he cannot get his fill
Never thought that he would ever
Want this much from a man
But love is the steepest sharpest slide

Oh here he'd lie at your side
Looking up into the sky
Wondering if this is allowed
But fear rules him easily
It takes lust and strength to
Turn to you and say

I want you and I need you
I want you and I need you

Sun has finally upped and gone
Being bored of everyone
I slip of my shirt and shoes
Time to hate myself again
My small voice and freckled skin
To the safety of the dark
Oh here I'd like between your thighs
Looking up into your eyes
Wondering if this is allowed
But fear rules me easily
It takes lust and strength to
Turn to you and say

I want you and I need you
I want you and I need you

But I haven't got the fattest chance in hell
But I haven't got the fattest chance in hell

So why does the world laugh and take us on these rides
My dear?
I'll shut my epileptic eyes and
Daydream of busy nights, my dear

Because I want you and I need you
I'll crush my arms around
Until I melt inside of you
Oh got I want you and I need you
I'll crush my arms around
Until I melt inside of you
Oh got I want you and I'll have you
I'll be your son your slave and keeper
There were four men in this room...
Why did you have to go and pick on me?
Why?Embed
