Blue Pedal Lyrics
All that was gold has lost its shine
All that was sure has become obscured
Yes there was autumn
Burnished and sleek
Fit for smiling, winged gliding
And now it's tarnished silver
Fading metal rusting hearts

Press the cooling pedal of blue freeze
As she must sleep again
She must sleep again
Turn the collapsing wheel of green
Turn the collapsing wheel of green
Between deaths we are butter
Soft believing melting butter
Well spread and well fed
Good fed on these deaths of our kind
Of our kind

Spiralling outer and outer beyond
What is there, behind the realm of senses
Beyond love, beyond our hopeless
Humanness lies the other side of
The bleeding rainbow where bones are collected
And we have come selected to recover
From this polluted mist
Between births we're tearing
Hard gurgling, snarling, fear
Lean and wary, alert untrusty
Still fed on these deaths of our kind
Where bones are collected and we have
Come selected to recover
From this polluted mist
Outer and outer and outer and outer and outer
Outer and outer and outer and outer and outer
