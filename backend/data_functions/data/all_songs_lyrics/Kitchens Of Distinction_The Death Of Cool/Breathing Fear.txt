Breathing Fear Lyrics
So full of hope that he can't sit still
Even in the presence of strangers
He's expecting his favourite guest
The boy with easy virtues
But when the boy arrives
He's got a black eye
From the lads who plague us outside
He laughs and calls for the world to die
Then hugs and kisses it better

Tell him why do you go to extremes
And how it must show

He's half-full of courage and he
Stumbles to work
Where they bitch about their babies
They ask him where he got his bruises
He mumbles excuses, he lies and lies
He cannot allow them to finish him off
Over-heated, overwrought
He refuses to die like a saint
Half-believed and always deceived
Tell him why do you go to extremes
And how it must show

Giving us grief for centuries now
Can't you ever rest?
Beaten, insulted, skewered and branded
Isn't waking enough?
You're breathing this fear just once a year
We suffocate every day
Hey... you're breathing this fear just once a year
We suffocate every day!Embed
