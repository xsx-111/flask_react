Mad As Snow Lyrics
It's ok, It's ok
I promise I'll stay
Turn down the lights
I'll sit with you
We'll talk like we're friends
Tell me where this troubled love began

We can count the flakes as it snows and snows
We can't get hurt, it melts and fades

Close your eyes
They've all gone now
So it's safe with me

Was it only last week
We got stoned off the sky
Flew under the stars?
Was it only last night
We made crazy promises
Mad as the snow?
We can count the flakes as it snows and snows
We can't get hurt, it melts and fades

Close your eyes
They've all gone now
So it's safe with me tonight

(Close your eyes
They've all gone now)Embed
