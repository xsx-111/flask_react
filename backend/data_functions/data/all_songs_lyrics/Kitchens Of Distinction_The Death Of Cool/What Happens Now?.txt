What Happens Now? Lyrics
Draw me something
Draw the line
Connecting what we did to what happens now
Don't understand how we changed
Not sure I'll ever know
It's all circles, colliding spheres
I closed off, chaos appears

Once we were all smiles and plans
And dressing up to go
Playing outside playing cars
Now it's all been tamed, I yell
"Don't stop! don't leave me here!
Don't stop won't get caught again
You can't go there's no sense anymore"
A tap of tears and a veil of guilt
Taunt me now
Growing growing growing gone
Years pick up speed again

Throw me pointers
No more jibes
There's this ancient knot inside my chest
It works it's way into my throat
Will not let these stories out
Refusal works, it always wins
Too much thought, too few grins
Once we were all smiles and plans
And dressing up to go
Playing outside playing cars
Now it's all been tamed, I yell
"Don't stop! don't leave me here!
Don't stop won't get caught again
You can't go there's no sense anymore"

Free you say, free to roam
But down below
Father, Mother, always guiding
Pointing out a world I refuse to know
Don't stop! don't stop!
Say it's all OK
You say, "where's the ache of freedom?
Where's the devil's whispers?
This is the sweetest pain
Run and run and run and run
Jump up as far as you can, shake your head
And breathe"Embed
