I Wish It Would Rain Lyrics(Nanci Griffith)
Oh, I wish it would rain
And wash my face clean
I want to find some dark cloud to hide in here
Love in a memory
Sparkled like diamonds
When the diamonds fall they burn like tears
Once I had a love from the Georgia pines
Who only cared for me
I wanna find that love of twenty-two
Here at thirty-three
I've got a heart on my right
One on my left neither suits my needs
No, the one I love lives a-way out West
And he never will need me
I'm gonna pack up my two step shoes
And head for the Gulf Coast plains
I wanna walk the streets of my own hometown
Where everybody knows my name
I wanna ride the waves down in Galveston
When the hurricane blow in
'cause that Gulf Coast water tastes sweet as wine
When your heart's rollin' home in the wind
When the diamonds fall, darlin'
They burn like tearsEmbed
