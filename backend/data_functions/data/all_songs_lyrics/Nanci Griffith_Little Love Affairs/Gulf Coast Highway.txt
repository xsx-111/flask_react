Gulf Coast Highway Lyrics
Gulf Coast Highway
He worked the rails
He worked the rice fields
With their cool, dark wells
He worked the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico
The only thing we've ever owned
Is this old house here by the road

And when he dies
He says he'll catch some blackbird's wing
Then he will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet, blue bonnet spring

She walked through springtime
When I was home
The days were sweet
The nights were warm
The seasons change, the jobs would come, the flowers fade
This old house felt so alone
When the work took me away

And when she dies
She says she'll catch some blackbird's wing
Then she will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet, blue bonnet spring
Highway 90
The jobs are gone
We tend our garden

We set the sun
This is the only place on Earth blue bonnets grow
Once a year they come and go
At this old house here by the road

And when we die
We say we'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away to heaven
Come some sweet, blue bonnet spring
Yes, when we die
We'll catch some blackbird's wing
And we will fly away together
Come some sweet blue bonnet springEmbed
