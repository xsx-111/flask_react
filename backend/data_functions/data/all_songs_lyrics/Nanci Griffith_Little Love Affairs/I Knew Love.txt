I Knew Love Lyrics(Roger Brown)
I knew love
When it still meant forever
When a feeling shared didn't always have to hurt
And a promise that was made would go unbroken
I knew love
When it was more than a word
I knew a time
When hope was all you needed
And if you cared you found a way to make things work
When life was what two people shared together
Oh, I knew love
When it was more than a word
Chorus
I knew love
When I could still believe
It was the greatest power in the world
I knew love
When it was more than just a word
I knew hearts
When they made it all so easy
And sad goodbyes were seldom ever heard
When I wouldn't have to read this note that says you're leaving
I knew love
When it was more than just a word
Chorus
I knew love when it was more than just a wordEmbed
