Outbound Plane Lyrics(Nanci Griffith - Tom Russell)
I don't want to be standing here
With this ticket for this outbound plane
Oh, I've been here before
Somehow this doesn't feel the same
Talk is cheap
So we could talk all night long
And we may never figure out just where your love went wrong
Chorus
Cause I don't want to be standing here
Don't want to be talking here
And I don't really care who's to blame
Cause if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane
The old folks say
Love is not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away from love alone
To pace the floor
Young or old
I say that love is still the same
You may walk away from love but you'll fall head and heel again
Chorus
Two lonely hearts in this airport knowing
Neither cares where that other heart is going
But, if love won't fly on its own free will
It's gonna catch that outbound plane
That frown you're wearing's
Just your halo turned upside down
Where is the laughter we once shared back in the lost and found?
These broken wings are gonna leave me here to stand my ground
You can have this ticket for that lonely plane that's flying out
