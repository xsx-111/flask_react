I Would Change My Life Lyrics(Robert Earl Keen, Jr)
You never liked this place where we'd been living all along
So, you packed up your things and bought a one-way ticket home
Leaving never hurts as much as being left behind
Chorus
I would change my life
I would make it right
I would change my life
If you would only change your mind
I have spent many hours on some misbegotten dream
I have spent my money on some foolish hearted things
I have spent my memory on old embittered wine
Chorus
I wish that I could find the words to make you come back home
I wish that I could say the things you needed for so long
I wish that you could see me, maybe then you'll find
Chorus (Twice)Embed
