Sweet Dreams Will Come Lyrics(John Stewart)
I'm sleepin' less in L.A
Dreamin' of days yet to come
Oh, and I don't care what you say
I know that those days will surely come
I'm wakin' and I'm callin'
I'm shakin' and I'm fallin'
Oh, little darlin'
I wonder when those sweet dreams will come
There's a hole in the sky
Made by my Right Guard last night
Oh, and then there's you and I
Assuring that everything's alright
We are nursing, pretending
Cursing then defending
And yet, it's never ending
Make ya wonder when those sweet dreams will come
Lookin' for some love
I guess that why people buy dogs
Is there someone up above?
And I wonder is the Captain keeping logs
I am cursing and I'm praying
Not knowin' what we're saying
And yet, it's everydaying
And I wonder when those sweet dreams will come
I feel like a fire
In the morning when the fire is out
I am walking on the wire
And the wire's what the whole thing is about
The pretender is thinning
Surrender is winning
And yet, it's a beginning
To feel like those sweet dreams will come
The pretender is thinning
Surrender is winning
And yet, it's beginning
To feel like those sweet dreams will come
Oh, little darlin'
Don't cha wonder when those sweet dreams will come
(Oh, sweet dreams will come)Embed
