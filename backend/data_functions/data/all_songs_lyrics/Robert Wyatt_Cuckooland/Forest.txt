Forest LyricsDeep in the forest
The omens are bad
A cloud passes over the moon
Devil Wind
Bends the trees
A cloud passes over the moon
And the moon takes a peep
When the Gypsy girl sings
And her song rises up
From the dark to the light
Like smoke to the sky
When the Gypsy girl sings
At the river's edge
Deep in the forest
The omens are bad
A cloud passes over the moon
White wolf waits
Grey wolf howls
At the girl by the river's edge
The bullet head boys
With their baby blue eyes
Their donner und blitzen
The lily white gadje
Religiously hatching their plots
In the eyries of eagles
But the moon's keeping watch
At the Gypsy girl sings
Sees her song rising up
Like smoke to the sky
From the dark to the light
When the Gypsy girl sings
At the river's edge
Like the sun on the forest
Her song rises up, from
The ashes of Auschwitz
The death camp at Lety
The white cliffs of Dover
The song of the Roma
Lives on and on...
Trees grow tall
Though the winds blow cold
Tall trees grow
Tall trees grow
Where the cold wind blow
Trees grow tallEmbed
