Cuckoo Madame LyricsCuckoo Madame
With your teddy bear eye
Yellow fingers clinging to the chain link fence
Bombers above you
Bombers behind you
Disapproval hounds you
Ugly rumour surrounds you
Solitary madam
We never understood, you
Never told us of your battle
With the cuckoo baby blues
Cuckoo Madame
It's no wonder you're shy
You're Greta Garbo
You're the witch of Salem
You're anti-social, and
You are too bloody lonely
For the likes of us
We never knew of your battle
With the cuckoo baby blues
When you saw that egg crack
It froze your blood
You knew you had to fly then
Had to say goodbye
Had to fly before you saw another mother
Feed your chick
You knew it would break your heart
You knew it would break your heartEmbed
