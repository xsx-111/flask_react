Beware LyricsYou might have a lot to say
There might be a price to pay
Just beware
They might smile and nod their heads
While they wish that you were dead
Just beware
Your friends might not be what they seem
Take it from me
If you're not careful
You might get hurt one last time
It's just a warning
Beware
Don't get caught off your guard
Evil lurks in all our hearts
Just beware
You won't last very long
Even if you are strong
Just beware
Don't trust anyone
They might be your enemy
If you're not careful
You might get hurt one last time
It's just a warning
Beware
Beware
