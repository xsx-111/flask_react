Lullaby for Hamza LyricsWhen bombers bomb again
I need your lullaby
Fires are burning
The nightmare's begun
The world is dark again
I need your lullaby
Sleep has gone
Night is long again
Sing me your song
Let me sleep
Bring me peace
When bombers bomb again
We'll need your lullaby
Children cry
Houses burn again
Once more
Sing songs to soothe them
To dry their tears
To drown the screams of war
The world's gone wrong again
I need your lullaby
Night is long
And sleep's just a dream
Sing your song
Stay close to me
Sing to me
Hushabye
The world is dark again
I need your lullaby
Sleep has gone
Night is much too long again
Sing me your song
Let me sleep
Bring me peaceEmbed
