Mister E LyricsI love suspense
The thrill of the unknown
What will I say?
I can't predict
Where will all this lead?
I don't want to know
Just take a chance
Things can't get much worse
Who knows?
They might improve
There's always hope
When will I learn to trust myself
Embrace mystery
Not be afraid?Embed
