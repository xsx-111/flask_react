Old Europe LyricsLe Chat qui Pêche
Rue de la Huchette
Paris at night
And the strains of a ghost saxophone
Juliette and Miles
Black and white city
Paris by night
And the ghosts of two people in love
I'll be dreaming again
Always dreams of yesterdays
Those days live on
Safe here in my heart
Cherchez la femme
Slips through a doorway
Out of the night
To the warmth of a new lover's arms
Rue St Benoît
La route enchantée
Indigo nights
And the ghost of the moon in the Seine
I'll be dreaming again
Always dreams of yesterdays
Those days live on
Safe here in my heartEmbed
