Insensatez LyricsHow insensitive I must have seemed
When he told me that he loved me
How unmoved and cold I must have seemed
When he told me so sincerely
Why, he must have asked, did I just
Turn and stare in icy silence?
What was I to say? What can you say
When a love affair is over?
Now he's gone away, but I'm alone
With the memory of his last look
Vague and drawn and sad, I see it still
All his heartbreak in that last look
Why, he must have asked, did I just
Turn and stare in icy silence?
What was I to do? What can one do?
When a love affair is over1Embed
