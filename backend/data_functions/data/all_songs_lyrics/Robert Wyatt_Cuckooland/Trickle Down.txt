Trickle Down LyricsOpen your window
Lend an ear
And then
Pull back the curtain
Hurry
So you can hear
Listen to the
Hum
As it rises
Riding the breeze
Leaving gravity's children
Agrounded
Onwards and upwards
That's the way
Ever on
Beyond the highest plateau
That's OK
There's a reason why some people float
Sometimes
Are floored
God knows this reason
That's what gods are for
Press on your window
Feel the paneEmbed
