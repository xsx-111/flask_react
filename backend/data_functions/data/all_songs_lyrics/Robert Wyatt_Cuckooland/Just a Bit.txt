Just a Bit LyricsFaith may not be such a bad thing
Hope can still feel pretty good
I'm as mad as any hatter
I feel safer touching wood
I like totem poles and icons
(icon tact is de rigeur)
So ring dem bells and pump that organ
Chants for him and hymns for her
'Bracadabra hocus locus
Magic mush, no room for doubt
As wailing walls induce psychosis
(beat your braincells inside out)
Transcendental art's religion
Thinking you'll improve your mind
When all it does (if you're in luck)
Is camouflage the daily grind
Nature's harmony's a discord
If you listen with both ears
Poor Gaia's up to here in white noise
She cannot assuage your fears
Superstition's like religion;
Bonsai version â€“ faintly sad
And I know that (I must admit it)
Touching wood is just a bit madEmbed
