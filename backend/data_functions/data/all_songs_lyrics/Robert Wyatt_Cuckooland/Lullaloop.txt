Lullaloop LyricsHold on
Can't walk faster
Can't get up the hill
Oy! You!
Wait for me
I'm out of breath
I'm ill
Slow down
Slow down
Hey! You!
Bin that Bebop
Ditch the dancing
Night's for lying down
Bit that Bebop
Ditch the dancing
Don that duvet
Cook the cocoa
Turn that music down!
Slow down
Slow down
Cut those capers
Keep your hair on
I should worry
You should coco
Dirty stop-out
Why? Oh why? Oh why?
Slow down
Slow down
Night's for lying down
(Sweet dreams
Old chap
Sweet dreams)Embed
