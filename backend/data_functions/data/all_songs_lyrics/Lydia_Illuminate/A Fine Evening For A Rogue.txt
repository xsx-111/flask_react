A Fine Evening For A Rogue LyricsIt started quite young
Yeah, I learned how to, to
To stay quiet, just stay quiet, always stay
Well cursed with disease
I have to be perfect
And you're no better than me, no
Don't you ever get lonely? Yeah
Don't you ever get lonely?
'Cause it's no better for me
I still cannot believe
Don't you ever get lonely? Yeah
Well, don't you ever get lonely?
'Cause I never saw you leave this lately
Well I wasn't sure that I would be staying
So let's stay quiet, girl, let's stay quiet
Then we can lay
Alive in this bed, alive for the evening
And you're no better than me
It's never gone, no
I could be so safe
Don't you ever get lonely? Yeah
Don't you ever get lonely?
'Cause it's no better for me
I still cannot believe
Don't you ever get lonely? Yeah
Well, don't you ever get lonely?
'Cause I never saw you leave this lately1Embed
