I Woke Up Near The Sea LyricsSo it's another night in my brain
Cause I can't sleep
And now it wears on your shoulders, oh
Just please don't ever leave me here
Don't ever leave me, don't you leave
Start out like a sailor
And bring back all you need
So everyone else can
Try and get some sleep
It turns out you were into yourself
It turns out you could fuck your way out
Just once more for my baby girl
It turns out you were into yourself
It turns out you could fuck your way out
And so I woke up near the sea
Sand in my dreams
Cause now you're already falling back in love with me
Just fall back in love, yeah
Just fall back in love
Start out like a sailor
And bring back all you need
So everyone else can
Try and get some sleep
It's just the season on your back
It's just the way we know to act
It's just the season on your back
It's just the way we know to act
It turns out you were into yourself
It turns out you could fuck your way out
Just once more for my baby girl
It turns out you were into yourself
It turns out you could fuck your way out
And no one ever knew...Embed
