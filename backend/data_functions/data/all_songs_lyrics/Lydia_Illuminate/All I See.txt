All I See Lyrics
All I see scares me
No one waits

You will never waste my time, no, no
You will never waste my time, cause
Well, she locks all the doors and turns, says
"We will always be safe here in this bed"
All I see scares me
And no one waits forever

So come closer, baby
I want to see what you're made of
See what you're made of
Cause this isn't all we could be
You're not the same, and I'm
I'm not the same and

No one could ever wait for you
And no one, yeah, no one could ever
Wait for you
I'll wait for you, love
But you are the never ending sleep
That I, I love to treat
With this medicine I get
From my, my closer friends
But all I see

So come closer, baby
I want to see what you're made of
See what you're made of
Cause this isn't all we could be
You're not the same, and I'm
I'm not the same andEmbed
