Stay Awake LyricsLive it up, live it up
Or just come back home
Yeah, cause these city lights are too much for you alone
But San Francisco sounds quite lovely
So I'll just wait for your call
I promise, I promise I'm holy, lonely
So stay awake and I'll stay
I try and go but your game, it waits for me and you, love
So cover up for the rain
You see in way too much safety
Cause I don't stand a chance
Any longer than you do, my friend
Cause we sure know best now that you're gone
Cause I can't breathe with these words on my tongue
But San Francisco still sounds lovely
Cause he swears he still loves you
He still loves you
He called, lonely
So stay awake and I'll stay
I try and go but your game, it waits for me and you love
So cover up for the rain
You see in way too much safety
Cause I don't stand a chance
Any longer than you do, my friend
But you're still keeping me sane
It's still in the way that I think
Nobody is watching, yeah, nobody is watching me
It's still in the way that I think
Nobody is watching, yeah, nobody is watching me
It's still in the way that I think
Nobody is watching, yeah, nobody is watching
The rain
You see in way too much safety
Cause I don't stand a chance
Any longer than you do my friend
But you're still keeping me sane
The rain
You see in way too much safety
Cause I don't stand a chance
Any longer than you do my friend
But you're still keeping me saneEmbed
