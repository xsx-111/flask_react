Sleep Well LyricsLiar, liar
You never called
But I'll be just fine, yeah I'm fine
Sleep well
This never made much sense to me so I sleep alone
Cause you are the same as I always remembered
I'll always remember
"Where was all your money?"
You said, "where is all your money?"
'Cause you like it more than ever
And I cannot stand this
'Cause you like it more than ever
It was just a goddamn mistake
Couldn't stay at home
Because you're way too good at faking
Love is too much
I'll be just fine here
Stay at home because it's always the same
Darling, you fucked up
I guess I love to spend all my time up in my own brain
Because I can't believe the words coming up out of your face
"Where was all your money?"
You said, "where is all your money?"
'Cause you like it more than ever
And I cannot stand this
'Cause you like it more than ever
I guess they all knew
Somebody draw the sun
Those states made me distant
Tell me it's alright
Tell me it's better
Well I can't believe you're still in the valley, wasting away
I guess they got the best of me and got your all
But I'll just be fine hereEmbed
