Hospital Lyrics
So I've been sleeping with this silence in my mind
And all I see scares me
And no one knows it, but she, she saved me
So I've been sleeping with this silence in my brain
I wake up everyday in this god damn place
I won't wait here anymore

It's still not quite the way it was
But you promised me this is love, so stay
Watch the hospital that's just across the street
From your apartment balcony
I'll never ever leave, yeah
I'll never leave

Oh, no one is watching now
Sing like you just might drown
But always come back home
Cause I never got to see you once more, no
I guess that's all I wanted
Yeah, I guess that's all I needed

Now look, we've made a fool out of love
When all we want is to be enough
When all we want is to feel enough
It's still not quite the way it was
But you promised me this is love, so stay
Watch the hospital that's just across the street
From your apartment balcony
I'll never ever leave, yeah
I'll never leave

Watch the hospital that's just across the street
(It's still not quite the way it was)
From your apartment balcony
(But you promised me this is love, so stay)
I'll never ever leave, yeah
I'll stay here1Embed
