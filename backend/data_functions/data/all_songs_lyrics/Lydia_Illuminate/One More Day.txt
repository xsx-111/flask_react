One More Day LyricsWell I saw you fall back once love
But I can't stay
Stay like this weather swirls
Cause you've become sick like this winter girl
Two more days
Just two more
Now I see
Don't you say that I've gone crazy
Because I haven't gone crazy yet
I just lost my mind
But I still got you
Stay up late so you're sure
Sure that I won't stray too far
But surely that got too hard
Love is not for me
I promise, love is not for me
One more day
Just one more
Don't you say that I've gone crazy
Because I haven't gone crazy yet
I just lost my mind
But I still got you
I'd stay if I ever could
Stay if I ever could
And pick up your pieces babe
Cause there's never a perfect day
I just lost my mind
But I still got youEmbed
