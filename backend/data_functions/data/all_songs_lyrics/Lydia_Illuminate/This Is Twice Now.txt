This Is Twice Now LyricsBaby just ask once more
Cause I saw your door wide open
But the floor is still freezing
Hailey, I was sick and I'm still quite unwell
Tell me it's you or nothing at all
Cause I stole your soul
You said I'd never be able
But oh, the whole world is still on my string
Second time now and you've done this before
Drive around the back so I can't see them
But you're still freezing
Let me take your coat and your keys and this car
Cause I’ve been unwell far too long now
Cause I stole your soul
You said I’d never be able
But oh, the whole world is still on my string, oh
But oh, the whole world is still on my string
And oh, the whole world is still on my string
Yeah, is still on my string
(It's never much when I sing about you.)1Embed
