Fate LyricsIt's just, it's just I can't seem to fall asleep these days
And you can't seem to stop digging this grave
'Cause you were only eighteen at the time
And I was holding up these streets just fine
Come on, oh, come on
Place me on your scene and I'll take
Everything that you ever said to me
No, it wasn't just words
(No, it wasn't just words)
But day after day after day
I call that fate
Oh, darling I've been thinking about you
And you are thinking how much fun it was
Filling up our lungs
But don't you just see what's happened?
Yeah, we never stay lonely, come on
Place me on your scene and I'll take
Everything that you ever said to me
No, it wasn't just words
(No, it wasn't just words)
But day after day after day
I call that fate
(I can't bear to see you)
Place me on your scene and I'll take
(Staring at the ceiling)
Everything that you ever said to me
No, it wasn't just words
(No, it wasn't just words)
Day after day after day
I call that
(I can't bear to see you)
Place me on your scene and I'll take
(Staring at the ceiling)
Everything that you ever said to me
No, it wasn't just words
(No, it wasn't just words)
Day after day after day
I call that fateEmbed
