Now The One You Once Loved Is Leaving LyricsTell me how I finally figured it out
That now you're caught in the things you said you'd never do
And now it's starting to show like her skin fell out out of her clothes
She's got a list of moves to make
Stay for me
Because it was the first
Yeah it was the...
Stay on me
Take your time lighting the room
When all is said and done I bet you're covering
Is it a wonder you're lonely
Taking chances to feel again
I bet you never knew
I bet you never
Stay for me
Because it was the first
Yeah it was the...
Stay on me
Suddenly a cloud must have cut a hole in my head
When I was tangled all in your words
How quick to forget
We are
With eyes unimpressed
You're sealing the conversations
And are you wondering how things could be
Just staring at the surface
When all the walls have tendencies
But it's not your fault when no one taught you how
And now the one you once loved is leaving
You're so sure that I'd be just fine here
But you were surely just taking your own time dear1Embed
