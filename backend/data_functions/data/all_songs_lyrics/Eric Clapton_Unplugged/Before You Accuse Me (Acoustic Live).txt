Before You Accuse Me (Acoustic Live) Lyrics
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else

I called your mama about three or four nights ago
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
Well your mother said
"Son, do not call my daughter no more"

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else

Come back home baby, try my love, one more time
Come back home baby, try my love, one more time
If I don't go on and quit you
I'm going to lose my mind

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone elseEmbed
