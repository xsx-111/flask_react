Alberta (Acoustic Live) LyricsHang on, hang on, hang on, hang on
Hahahahaha

Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
I've had no loving
Since you've been gone

Alberta, Alberta
Where'd you stay last night?
Alberta, Alberta
Where'd you stay last night?
Come home this morning
Clothes don't fit you right
Alberta, Alberta
Girl, you're on my mind
Alberta, Alberta
Girl, you're on my mind
I've had no loving
Such a great long time
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
Alberta, Alberta
Where have you been so long?
I've had no loving
Since you've been goneEmbed
