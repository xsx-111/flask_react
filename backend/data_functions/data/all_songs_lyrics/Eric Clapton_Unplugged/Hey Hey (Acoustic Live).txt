Hey Hey (Acoustic Live) Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby, hey
I love you, baby
Sure there is not going to be your dog

Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, baby, hey
My arms around you baby
All I can say is, "Hey"


Hey, hey, you lost your good thing now
Hey, hey, you lost your good thing now
You had me fooled
I found it out somehow1Embed
