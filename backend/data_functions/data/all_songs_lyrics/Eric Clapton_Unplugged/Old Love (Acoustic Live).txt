Old Love (Acoustic Live) Lyrics
I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will alway burn
I'll never get over
I know that I'll never learn
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on homeEmbed
