San Francisco Bay Blues (Acoustic Live) Lyrics
I got the blues from my baby, left me by the San Francisco Bay
The ocean liner's gone so far away
Didn't mean to treat her so bad, she was the best girl I ever have had
She said goodbye, I can take a cry, I want to lay down and die
I haven't got a nickel and I haven't got a lousy dime
She doesn't come back, think I'm going to lose my mind
If she ever gets back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay
Sitting down looking from my back door
Wondering which way to go
The woman I'm so crazy about, she doesn't love me no more
Think I'll catch me a freight train, because I'm feeling blue
And ride all the way to the end of the line, thinking only of you
Meanwhile, in another city
Just about to go insane
Thought I heard my baby, Lord, the way she used to call my name
If I ever get her back to stay, it's going to be another brand new day

Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay1Embed
