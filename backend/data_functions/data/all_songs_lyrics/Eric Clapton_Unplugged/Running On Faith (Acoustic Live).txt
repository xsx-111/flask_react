Running On Faith (Acoustic Live) Lyrics
Lately, I have been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you

Lately, I have been talking in my sleep
I can't imagine what I would have to say
Except my world will be right
When love comes back your way
I've always been
One to take each and every day
Seems like by now
I would find a love who cares just for me

Lately, I have been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you

Lately, I have been running on faith
What else can a poor boy do?
But my world will be right
When love comes over you2Embed
