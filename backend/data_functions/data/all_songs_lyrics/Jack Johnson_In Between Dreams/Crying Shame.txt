Crying Shame Lyrics
It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
How will this all play out
Of sight, out of mind now

By now we should know how to communicate
Instead of coming to blows, We're on a roll
And there ain't no stopping us now
We're burning under control
Isn't it strange how we're all
Burning under the same sun?
Buy now and save, it's a war for peace
It's the same old game
But do we really want to play?
We could close our eyes, it's still there
We could say it's us against them
We could try but nobody wins
Gravity has got a hold on us all

Could try to put it out
But it's a growing flame
Using fear as fuel
Burning down our name
And it won't take too long
'Cause words all burn the same
And who we're gonna blame now in all?
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame, shame, shame

By now it's beginning to show
A number of people are numbers that ain't coming home
I could close my eyes it's still there
Close my mind be alone
I could close my heart and not care
But gravity has got a hold on us all
It's a terrific price to pay
But in the true sense of the word
Are we using what we've learned?
In the true sense of the word
Are we losing what we were?

It's such a tired game
Will it ever stop?
It's not for me to say
And is it in our blood?
Or is it just our fate?
And how will this all play out?
Of sight, out of mind
And who we're gonna blame all in all?
It's just a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame
It's such a crying, crying, crying shame, shame, shameEmbed
