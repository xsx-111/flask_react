Never Know LyricsI heard this old story before
Where the people keep on killing for their metaphors
But don't leave much up to the imagination
So I want to give this imagery back
But I know it just ain't so easy like that
So I turn the page
And read the story again and again and again

It sure seems the same
With a different name
We're breaking and rebuilding
And we're growing, always guessing

Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're trying
But where is this all leading?
We'll never know

It all happened so much
Faster than you can say disaster
Want to take a time-lapse
And look at it backwards find the last word
And maybe that's just the answer
That we're afterBut after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot just
One breath in a chain of thought
We're moments just combusting
We feel certain but we'll never never know
It sure seems the same
Give it a different name
We're begging and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing

Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
We're helping
Rebuilding, never growing
Never know, if you never know, never know, never know

Knock knock, coming door to door
To tell you that their metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
And things are looking pretty grim
If you don't believe in what they're spoon-feeding
It's got no feeling
So I read it again and again and again
It sure seems the same
So many different names
Our hearts are strong, our heads are weak
We'll always be competing

Never knowing
We're shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing and confusing
But the true things
All we got is questions
We'll never know

Never know, never know, never know...1Embed
