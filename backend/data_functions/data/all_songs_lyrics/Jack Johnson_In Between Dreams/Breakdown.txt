Breakdown Lyrics
I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
See what there is to see
Time is just a melody

With all the people in the street
Walking as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
Well the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now so for now I

I need this old train to break down
Oh please just let me please breakdown

Well this engine screams out loud
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
Because it's gonna sting me when I leave this town

And all the people in the street
That I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get
To where I don't need to be so I
I need this old train to break down
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I need this old train to break down
Oh please just let me please breakdown

I want to break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down

But you can't stop nothing if you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind that you kept and you know
You don't know nothing but you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees, not the glass windows
You can't stop wishing if you don't let go
The things that you find and you lose and you know
You keep on rolling, put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright, so put the blinds down low

I need this old train to break down
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I need this old train to break down
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I want to break on down
But I can't stop now11Embed
