Situations Lyrics
Situation number one
It's the one that's just begun
But evidently it's too late

Situation number two
It's the only chance for you
It's controlled by denizens of hate

Situation number three
It's the one that no one sees
It's all too often dismissed as fate

Situation number four
The one that left you wanting more
It tantalized you with its bait
