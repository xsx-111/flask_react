Constellations Lyrics
The light was leaving, in the west it was blue
The children's laughter sang
And skipping just like the stones they threw
Their voices echoed across the waves
It's getting late

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light to lay down underneath the stars
Listen to Papa's translations of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations

The west winds often last too long
And when they calm down nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain
Clouds keep moving to uncover the sea
Of stars up above us chasing the day away
To find the stories that we sometimes need
Listen close enough, all else fades
Fades away

It was just another night
With a sunset and a moonrise not so far behind
To give us just enough light to lay down underneath the stars
Listen to all the translations of the stories across the sky
We drew our own constellations4Embed
