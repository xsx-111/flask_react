If I Could Lyrics
A brand new baby was born yesterday, just in time
Papa cried, baby cried, said your tears are like mine
I heard some words from a friend on the phone, didn't sound so good
The doctors gave him two weeks to live, I'd give him more if I could

You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could

Down the middle drops one more grain of sand
They say that new life makes losing life easier to understand
Words are kind they help ease the mind
I'll miss my old friend
And though you've got to go we'll keep a piece of your soul
One goes out, one comes in

You know that I would now
If only I could
You know that I would now
If only I could2Embed
