Staple It Together Lyrics
It's really too bad
He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he got to do
It's really no good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did 'cause he forgot to look

He better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather, mm-mmm

Well I guess you could say
That he don't even know where to begin
'Cause he looked both ways but he was so afraid
Digging deep into the ditch, every chance he missed
And the mess he made
'Cause hate is such a strong word
And every brick he laid, a mistake they say
That his walls are getting taller, and his world is getting smaller
Better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather, mm-mmm

It's really too bad
He became a prisoner of his own past
He stabbed the moment in the back with the round thumbtack
That held up the list of things he got to do
It's really no good
He's moving on before he understood
He shot the future in the foot with every step he took
Caught from the places that he did 'cause he forgot to look

He better staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather
Staple it together and call it bad weather

If the weather gets better we should get together
Spend a little time or we could do whatever
And if we get together we'd be twice as clever
So staple it together and call it bad weather, mm-mmm1Embed
