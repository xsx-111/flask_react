Good People Lyrics
Oh you win, it's your show now
So what's it going to be?
'Cause people will tune in
How many train wrecks do we need to see
Before we lose touch, oh
And we thought this was low
Well it's bad, getting worse so...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do
Bad news misused, got too much to lose
Give me some truth now, whose side are we on
Whatever you say
Turn on the boob-tube, I'm in the mood to obey
So lead me astray
And by the way now...
Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow

Sitting around feeling far away
So far away but I can feel the debris
Can you feel it?
You interrupt me from a friendly conversation
To tell me how great it's all going to be
You might notice some hesitation
Because it's important to you, it's not important to me
But way down by the edge of your whole reason
Well, it's beginning the show
And all I really want to know is...

Where'd all the good people go?
I've been changing channels
I don't see them on the TV shows
Where'd all the good people go?
We got heaps and heaps of what we sow
(Where'd all the good people go?)
They got this and that with a rattle a tat
Testing, one, two, man whatcha gonna do
Bad news misused give me some truth
You got too much to lose
Now whose side are we on today, anyway
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Okay, whatever you say
Wrong and resolute but in the mood to obey
Station to station desensitizing the nation
(Where'd all the good people go?)
Going, going, gone12Embed
