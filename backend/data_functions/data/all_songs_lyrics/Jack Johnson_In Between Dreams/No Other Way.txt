No Other Way Lyrics
When your mind is a mess, so is mine, I can't sleep
'Cause it hurts when I think my thoughts aren't at peace
With the plans that we make, the chances we take
They're not yours, they're not mine
There's waves that can break
All the words that we said and the words that we mean
Words can fall short, can't see the unseen
'Cause the world is awake for somebody's sake
Now please close your eyes
Woman, please get some sleep

And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
We told each other there is no other way

Too much silence can be misleading
You're drifting, I can hear it in the way that you're breathing
We don't really need to find reason
'Cause out the same door that it came well it's leaving, it's leaving
Leaving like a day that's done and part of a season
Resolve is just a concept that's as dead as the leaves
But at least we could sleep, it's all that we need
When we wake we would find, our minds would be free
To go to sleep
And know that if I knew all of the answers
I would not hold them from you
Know all of the things that I know
'Cause we told each other there is no other way6Embed
