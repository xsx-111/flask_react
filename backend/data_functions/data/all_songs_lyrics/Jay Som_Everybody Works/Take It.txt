Take It LyricsMy home it feels so small
I see the walls cave in
No time to make memories again
Replace my sad with happy
And take it out for a spin
The time on my wrist twitches, it knows what happens next
To the sky that's above:
Is that all that you got?
Take your thumb off my pulse
Remember me now
Really good at embarrassing me
You poke at flaws everybody can see
Well I heard the news
Good tidings to you
If my memory serves me right
You were easy to break
To the sky that's above:
Is that all that you got?
Take your thumb off my pulse
Remember me now
Is you that all that you have?
Is that all that you've got?
Is that all you have?
Is that all you've got?Embed
