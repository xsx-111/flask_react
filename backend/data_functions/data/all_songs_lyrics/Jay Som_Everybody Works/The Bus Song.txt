The Bus Song Lyrics
Take your time
Won't be long til our car breaks down
Your hands in mine
Feel like a firefighter when I take off your shoes
And more that's in-between
The knots are loose
I'll cut them just to see you through

Why don't we take the bus?
You say you don't like the smell
But I like the bus
I can be whoever I want to be

Take time to figure it out
I'll be the one who sticks around
And I just want you to lead me
And I just want you to need me

My sister knows
She says that ghosts are real
Yeah, my sister knows
Tells me everything I want to hear
Are secrets still a thing?
Are secrets still a thing?
You lie and you make believe
You can hide but you can't deceive
I can't tell you anything
I can't tell you anything

Take time to figure it out
I'll be the one who sticks around
And I just want you to lead me
And I just want you to need me5Embed
