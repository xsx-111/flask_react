Remain LyricsI know, I know
We're not turning back around, turning back around
Let go, let go
There's nothing up my sleeves, nothing up my sleeves
I know, I know, know, know, know
Our pinkie promises were never meant for this
I remain, under the moon
Watching it move
I remain, under the moon
Watching it moveEmbed
