1 Billion Dogs LyricsI forget
Just like a kid
Can't see straight
I'm tired and I'm alone
Kiss until
These arguments
Back and forth
I'll cut them down
My head is through the ceiling
Going up up up up up up ahhahh-up
Going up up up up up up ahhahh-up
I forget
Just like a kid
I can't see straight
I tired and I'm alone
Kiss until
These arguments
Back and forth
I will cut them down
My head is through the ceiling
Going up up up up up up ahhahh-up
Going up up up up up up ahhahh-up
I'm going up up up up up up uhhuhh-up
