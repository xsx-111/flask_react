For Light LyricsToday I'll take a walk
Feel the sun against my skin
For I am worn down
My sandpaper tongue crawls out
And I
I'll be right on time
Open blinds for light
Won't forget to climb
I'll be right on time
Open blinds for light
Won't forget to climb
On the small of your back
I trace a line to carve
And sign my resignation
I'll break to chew on glass
And I
I'll be right on time
Open blinds for light
Won't forget to climb
I'll be right on time
Open blinds for light
Won't forget to climbEmbed
