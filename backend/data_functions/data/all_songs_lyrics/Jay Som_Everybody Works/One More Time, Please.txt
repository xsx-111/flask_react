One More Time, Please Lyrics
Tell me that you felt it
Tell me it won't go to waste
Something in the stars
Tell me it won't be okay
You've got me running in circles
My thinking pattern fades
Pull yourself away
I can't wait to find rest
Won't you just give me piece of mind
I can't wait to find rest
Won't you just give me piece of mind
I can't wait to find rest
Won't you just give me piece of mind
I can't wait to find rest
Won't you just give me piece of mind
I'm not okay
I don't feel like I'm here
We're not the same1Embed
