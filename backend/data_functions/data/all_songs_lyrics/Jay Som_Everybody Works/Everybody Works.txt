Everybody Works LyricsI'm a good kid
I swear I don't lie
I'll get a job
Turn into one lovely guy
Hey, you're a rockstar
But do you have the time?
Did you pay your way through?
The right place, the right time?
Try to make ends meet
Penny pinch 'til I'm dying
Everybody works
My folks they don't think it's right to be living in a shell
I'll just bite hard on the luck
I've read it in the books
I swear I'll be good
Try to make ends meet
Penny pinch til I'm dying
Everybody works
I'm calling everyone I know
I'm lying on the telephone
My promises were never made
I guess I'll never feel okay
Everybody works
Everybody works
Everybody works
Everybody works
Everybody works
Everybody works
Everybody works
Everybody works
Everybody works
Everybody works
You don't want to see me like this
You don't want to see me like thisEmbed
