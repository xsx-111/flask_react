(BedHead) LyricsOnce I was very brave
I stepped on that stage
It took my breath away
Nerves caught around my neck
I cried out for help
No one was there
My words turned into ash
They went nowhere
As if I'm barely there
Collect my troubles
Spit out when I'm told
Repeat it and
I'll take what's left of
My strength and get on
My feet again
On the tip of my tongue
I breathe again
I bury my stutter
On the tip of my tongue
I breathe again
I bury my stutterEmbed
