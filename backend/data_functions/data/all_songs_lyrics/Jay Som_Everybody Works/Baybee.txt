Baybee Lyrics
You're content with what you have
With your hands tied behind your back

I know
You know

If I leave you alone
When you don't feel right
I know we'll sink for sure
I'll play your game once more
If you don't feel right
If you don't feel right

Sweetheart, listen
Make up your mind
Whatever helps you sleep in the night
Pieces wonâ€™t mend back together, that's a shame
You shave at parts of me I must erase

'Cause I know
You know
I know
If I leave you alone
When you don't feel right
I know we'll sink for sure
I'll play your game once more
If you don't feel right
If you don't feel right
If you don't feel right
If you don't feel right
If you don't feel right1Embed
