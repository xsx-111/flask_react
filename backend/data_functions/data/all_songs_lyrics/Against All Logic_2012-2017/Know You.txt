Know You LyricsI got to get to know you much better
We got to spend some more time getting (together)
I know we're still strangers in the party
I know you got to feel as if something (going) different (down here)
Come on and let the music overtake you
Nobody in the world can make you (or break you)
Come on, you make my spirit start living
Come on, you got the power to do it, do it
I got to get to know you much better
We got to spend some more time getting (together)
I know we're still strangers in the party
I know you got to feel as if something (going) different (down here)
Come on and let the music overtake you
Nobody in the world can make you (or break you)
Come on, you make my spirit start living
Come on, you got the power to do it, do it

I know you got to feel as if something different (down)

Nobody in the world can make you (or break you)
Come on, you make my spirit start living
Come on, you got the power to do it, do it
Woo

I know you got to feel as if something (going) different (down here)
Come on and let the music overtake you
Nobody in the world can make you (or break you)
Come on, you make my spirit start living
Come on, you got the power to do1Embed
