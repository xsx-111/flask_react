Bait and Switch LyricsI finally had all my ducks in a row
Peace and quiet, a means of subtraction
How she got in, I'm not sure that I know
Two weeks on and my spine was in traction, my eyes in a basket
My gut and my heart are so out of phase
And that kind of girl, she ain't nobody's daughter
I'm just not used to these powerful waves
She's shining the brass and I’m taking on water
What am I to do now?

I call on a beautiful witch with a moral compass
Bait and switch
Hide from my psychic derailleur
Drive his car to the sea
Spend the night as high as I can In a towering hemlock
But it's no use. I can always be found
A creature of habit has no real protection
I tell her I'll leave if she don't settle down
She sees it's a lie on closer inspection
Like everyone else does
Been rubbing a terrible charm
Holding smoke in my arms
I'm just a simple man
Cursed with an honest heart
Watch it go and tear it all apart
Been rubbing a terrible charm
Holding smoke in my arms
I’m just a simple man
Cursed with an honest heart
Watch her go and tear it all apartEmbed
