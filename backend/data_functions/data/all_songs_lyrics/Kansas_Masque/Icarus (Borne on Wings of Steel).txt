Icarus (Borne on Wings of Steel) LyricsEarly in the morning sunlight
Soaring on the wings of dawn
Here I'll live and die with my wings in the sky
And I won't come down no more
Higher than the birds I'm flying
Crimson skies of ice and fire
Borne on wings of steel, I have so much to feel
And I won't come down no more
Sail on, sail on
I will rise each day to meet the dawn
So high, so high
I've climbed the mountains of the sky
Without my wings
You know, I'd surely die
I found my freedom flying high
I've climbed the mountains of the sky

Floating on the clouds of amber
Searching for the rainbow's end
Earth so far below me, I'm here alone
And I won't come down no more
Sail on, sail on
I will rise each day to meet the dawn
So high, so high
I've climbed the mountains of the sky
Without my wings
You know, I'd surely die
I found my freedom flying high
I've climbed the mountains of the skyEmbed
