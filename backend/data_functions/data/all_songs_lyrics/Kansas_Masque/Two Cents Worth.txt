Two Cents Worth LyricsWell, I've been drinkin' again
And I know it's a sin
But I just can't refuse an old friend
Cause life is gettin' me down
And I've been two times around
And there ain't nothing but pain around the bend
I'm not made for the time
I'm born in the wrong century
There's too much craziness here
In twenty-five years I have used all the tears in my eyes
Now this old world is a fright
You know my future ain't bright
And I'd just crawl in a hole if I could
Or maybe live out in space
Or some other far away place
And not come back to this Earth till it's good
Oh, but I'm dreaming again
I know that I'm here till the end, what a long time
There's too much craziness here
In twenty-five years I have used all the tears in my eyes
Oh yeah
Well, you might think that I'm wrong
The things I say in this song
I really wish I could see it your way
But there's a storm rollin' in
And it just might be the end
So I'm praying we'll all get away
Now my cup's running dry
The weight of the world gets me down
There's way too much craziness here
In twenty-five years I have used all the tears in my eyes
Oh yeah
There's nowhere to turn
So I'll just have to learn not to cry, no more
It's all I can do till we find something new
But I'll get by, you know I'll try
In twenty-five years I have used all the tears in my eyesEmbed
