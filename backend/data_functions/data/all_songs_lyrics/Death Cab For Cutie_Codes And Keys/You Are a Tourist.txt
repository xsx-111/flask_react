You Are a Tourist Lyrics
This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher

When there's a burning in your heart
An endless yearning in your heart
Build it bigger than the sun
Let it grow, let it grow
When there's a burning in your heart
Don't be alarmed

This fire grows higher

When there's a doubt within your mind
Because you're thinking all the time
Framing rights into wrongs
Move along, move along
When there's a doubt within your mind

When there's a burning in your heart
And you think it'll burst apart
Or there's nothing to fear
Save the tears, save the tears
When there's a burning in your heart
And if you feel just like a tourist in the city you were born
Then it's time to go
And define your destination
There's so many different places to call home
Because when you find yourself the villain in the story you have written
It's plain to see
That sometimes the best intentions are in need of redemptions
Would you agree?
If so please show me

This fire grows higher
This fire grows higher

When there's a burning in your heart
When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher)
When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher. This fire grows higher)
When there's a burning in your heart (This fire grows higher. This fire grows higher)
When there's a burning in your heart...5Embed
