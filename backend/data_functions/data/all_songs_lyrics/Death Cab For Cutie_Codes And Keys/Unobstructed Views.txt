Unobstructed Views Lyrics
There's no eye
In the sky
Just our love
No unobstructed views
No perfect truths
Just our love, just our love
And there's no verse
No monument of words
For our love
For they can't hold
All I know
About my love, about my love

Storm clouds break
Pools remain
Memories flood
Earthen graves
Evaporate
To up above
Where they become
New love
New love

There's no eye
In the sky
Just our love, just our love
No unobstructed views
No perfect truths
Just our love, just our love4Embed
