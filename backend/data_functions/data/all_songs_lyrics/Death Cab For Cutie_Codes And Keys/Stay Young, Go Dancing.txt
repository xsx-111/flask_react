Stay Young, Go Dancing LyricsLife is sweet
In the belly of the beast, in the belly of the beast
And with her song in your heart
It can never bring you down, it can never bring you down
Lost in a maze
Of a thousand rainy days, of a thousand rainy days
But when I heard her voice
Oh, it led me to the end, yes, it led me to the end
Cause when she sings, I hear a symphony
And I'm swallowed in sound as it echoes through me
I'm renewed, oh, how I feel alive
And through autumn's advancing, we'll stay young, go dancing
As the music plays
Feel our bodies' sway
When we move as one
We stay young
Go dancing
Life is sweet
In the belly of the beast, in the belly of the beast
And with her song in your heart
It can never bring you down, it can never bring you down
Cause when she sings, I hear a symphony
And I'm swallowed in sound as it echoes through me
I'm renewed, oh, how I feel alive
And through winter's advancing, we'll stay young, go dancing
Stay young, go dancing
Stay young, go dancingEmbed
