Some Boys LyricsSome boys are filling, some boys are filling the hole
They're making the killing at the top of the billing
It's their role, and that's all that they know
But some boys don't listen, some boys don't listen at all
They don't ask for permission, they lack inhibitions
No walls, and they get what they want
But some boys don't know how to love
Some boys are singing, some boys are singing the blues
Joylessly flinging with the girls that they're bringing
To their rooms, and then leave when they're through
Some boys are sleeping, some boys are sleeping alone
Cause there's no one that's keeping them warm through evening
And they know that they're on their own
Cause some boys don't know how to love
Some boys are filling, some boys are filling the hole
Some boys are sleeping, some boys are sleeping alone
Some boys don't know how to love
No, some boys don't know how to love
No, some boys don't know how to love
No, some boys don't know how to love
They won't get what they want1Embed
