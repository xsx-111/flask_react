Monday Morning Lyrics
She may be young but she only likes old things
And modern music, it ain't to her taste
She loves the natural light
Captured in black and white

She sees mirages of mountain ranges
Within the blink of her eyes, it changes
Back to the open plain
Oh no, she can't explain

I cry out "Love keep your arms around me"
I am a bird that's in need of grounding
I'm built to fly away, I
Never learned how to stay

The night is gonna fall
And the vultures will surround you
And when you're looking in the mirror
What you see is gonna astound you
But all these lines and greys refine
They are the maps of our design
Of what began on a Monday morning
Monday morning
Monday morning
Oh
Oh

The night is gonna fall
And the vultures will surround you
And when you're looking in the mirror
What you see is gonna astound you
But all these lines and greys refine
They are the maps of our design
Of what began on a Monday morning

Oh yes, the night is gonna fall
And the vultures will surround you
And when you're looking in the mirror
What you see is gonna astound you
And while the glow of youth in time eludes
It's burning on inside of you
It all began on a Monday morning

Monday morning
Monday morningEmbed
