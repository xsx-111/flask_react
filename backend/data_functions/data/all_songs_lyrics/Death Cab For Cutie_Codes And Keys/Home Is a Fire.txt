Home Is a Fire LyricsSleep, sleep with the lights on
Shuttered with shades drawn
There's too many windows
Noise, cars on the freeway
Attempting a clean break
There's nowhere left to go
Watching the roots weave
Through cracks in the concrete
Plates, they will shift
Houses will shake
Fences will droop
We will awake
Only to find
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Home, home is a fire
Burning reminder
Of where we belong, love
With walls built up around us
The bricks make me nervous
They're only so strong, love
They're only so strong, love
Plates, they will shift
Houses will shake
Fences will droop
We will awake
Only to find
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
Nothing's the same
As yesterday
As yesterday2Embed
