Hands of Reason Lyrics
I speak of people
Whose game is disguise
The myth of flavour
Appears with no sign

'Cause I see it coming
Just like a long lost friend
A temple of rubble
The low and blind betray

Inane, the pleasures
That leave a sorry state
You're told of treasures
Indulgence cannot wait

But wait for tomorrow
And steal some sanity
Insane thoughts are borrowed
Unable to repay them back

As I now fall
Fall into deprivation
Fall
Fallen there's still tomorrow
Love hides the things you'll never know
You'll never know
A lack of reason
That makes a mortal man
Untold the treason
The past where it began

'Cause I see the horror
Horror to think about
Insane thoughts are borrowed
Unable to repay them back

As I see the blood
Blood on the hands of reason
Blood
Bloody the hands that lead me
Love for the ones you cannot knowEmbed
