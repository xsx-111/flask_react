Hallowed Land Lyrics
You'd love to be so far away
It's not a long way to go
It's gonna end in your pain
Greet open handed stranger
Create the turmoil, you're not sane
I want the last one to go to embers will revive
So stay

You want to live a lifetime each and every day

You've struggled before
I swear to do it again
You've told it before till I
Until I'm weakened and sore

Seek hallowed land
Seek hallowed land

You'd love to see right through my veins
The pale reflection tells all
Predominations sustain
Crawl over land or mountain
In sight the ultimate escape
A silhouette subsiding
Enticed unable to relate
You want to live a lifetime each and every day

You've beckoned before
You'll never do it again
You've prayed before
Who are the prayers for

Seek hallowed land
Seek hallowed land

Begone the fools that lead me
I need not to know
Accept reclining spirit
I need to endure
You try to live a lifetime each and every day
In this short time of promise, you're a memoryEmbed
