Walk Away LyricsAnd in the Summer when the clouds show through
I might go the same way too if
You and I could talk together
Well what I supposed to do with
You and I would walk together
Then with always close around and
Now you gaze towards the doorway
When the weather comes falling down
And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay
Would you choose to walk
Would you choose to stay
Would you walk, walk, walk, walk, walk away
And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay
Would you choose to walk
Would you choose to stay
Would you walk, walk, walk, walk, walk away
Though when the day is nearly through
I might see the same way too
If you would name the things that bring you down on me so I could see it's
Not quite true if you don't really know
Or understand the circumstance
Behind then I might clear your mind
And you won't have to go so
And when the rain comes down
Would you choose to walk or stay
Would you choose to walk
Would you choose to stay
Would you walk, walk, walk, walk, walk awayEmbed
