Forever Failure Lyrics
Understand procedure, understand war
Understand rules, regulations
I don't understand sorry

You must feel frustration
'Cause your mind feels such temptation
And your ways appear a total lack of faith
You may feel elation
At your body's recreation
And the joy you need, restricted by one thought

Are you forever
Loss of purpose in a passive life
Are you forever
Pale, regarded as a waste of time

High times are courageous
But in truth they suit no purpose
Induced, reduced, unable and afraid
Can you feel rejection
And a lack of motivation
And the joy you need, restricted and delayed
Are you forever
Loss of purpose in a passive life
Are you forever
Pale, regarded as a waste of time

I don't really know what sorry means
I've been sorry all my life
I'm sorry I was born, that's what my mother told me
I don't really know what sorry means
I've been sorry all my life
I don't really know what sorry meansEmbed
