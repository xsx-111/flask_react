Yearn for Change Lyrics
Approaching a silence, a blur of subsidence
Time may heal all troubles, is that what I've found?
Joy entices all, until death's lonely shroud
But I know it's forever

Praying for a change
Praying for a change

Our lives leading onwards, the essence is stronger
Memories of life drifting further away
I must doubt that where there's a will there's a way
But I know it's forever

Praying for a change
Praying for a change

Life is all the pain we endeavour
Life is all the pain we endeavour
Life is all the pain we endeavour
Life is all the pain we endeavour
Life is all the pain we endeavour
Praying for a change
Praying for a change
Praying for a change
Praying for a changeEmbed
