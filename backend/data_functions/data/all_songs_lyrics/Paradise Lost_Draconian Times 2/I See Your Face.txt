I See Your Face Lyrics
Coming back today, the pounding thoughts relay
It's a time that's for myself
I'm laying low, strife is gaining slow
A kind of anguish I don't need

When I see your frown, hurt will put me down
If I could see a light shining
Is this borrowed time, maybe a final time
That I can see a light shining

Will you make it slow, 'cause evil makes it slow
I know you're brandishing the sign
Dare I take a chance in this circumstance
Or will I leave without a hope

When you seal my fate, sorrow turns to hate
If I can see a light shining
Is this borrowed time, maybe a final time
That I can see a light shining

What one man makes is there for one to take
A single handed fall from grace
Heart's beating fast, beating till the last
A draining feeling's all that I know
When I see your frown, it becomes my frown
If I could see a light shining
Is this borrowed time, maybe a final time
That I can see a light shining
See a light shiningEmbed
