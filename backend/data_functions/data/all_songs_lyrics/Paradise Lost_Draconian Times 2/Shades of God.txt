Shades of God Lyrics
The fire is gone, a time to search and then replace
I'll never know just how the blind can lead the way

They search for faith
It shows the way
It leads the way
The distant smile
Banished denial
No more denial

Are you the one who tries to send me to the grave
I cannot know what deals the truth, what deals the pain

Weak search for faith
A path to take
You tread in vain
The distant smile
Banished denial
No more denialEmbed
