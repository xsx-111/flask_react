The British Road LyricsThose foreigners are at it again
When will they learn to fight like our men?
How can I rise if you don't fall?
There's nothing new under the mirror
And it's time for one more bedtime story
Those foreigners are at it again
When will they learn to fight like our men?
Get beauty sleep for morning glory
How can I rise if you don't fall?
If you don't fall
If you don't fall
If you don't fall
There's nothing new under the mirror
And it's time for one more bedtime story
Those foreigners are at it again
When will they learn to fight like our men?
Get beauty sleep for morning glory
How can I rise if you don't fall?
If you don't fall
If you don't fall
If you don't fall
If you don't fall
If you don't fall
If you don't fallEmbed
