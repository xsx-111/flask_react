Gharbzadegi Lyrics(I've got an hat but it ain't like that, old rottenhat)
It's so easy to decide on a name
It's a name caller's game
It's so easy to look down from above
Helicopter vision
Get the picture when you're outside the frame
Retrospective my eye
And we get so out of touch
Words take the place of meaning
So out of touch
Words take the place of meaning
Call it art and you can say what you like
It's a name caller's game
Your perspective describes where I stand
Out of line, out of mind
Calling myopia 'focus', of course
Makes it easier still
Gharbzadegi means nothing to me
Westernitis to you
...We get so out of touch
Words take the place of meaning
So out of touch
Words take the place of meaning
So out of touch
Words take the place of meaning
So out of touch
Words take the place of meaningEmbed
