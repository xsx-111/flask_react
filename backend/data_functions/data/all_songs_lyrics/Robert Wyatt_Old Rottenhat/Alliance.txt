Alliance LyricsThere is a kind of compromise you are master of
Your endless gentle nudging left us polarised
It's hard to talk to enemies â€“ and we are enemies
What we had in common makes it even worse
You're proud of being middle class (meaning upper class)
You say you're self sufficient (but you don't dig your own coal)
I think that what you're frightened of more than anything
Is knowing you need workers more than they need you
"A herd of independent minds" Chomsky got it right
You're jogging into battle waving old school ties1Embed
