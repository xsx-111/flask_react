Mass Medium LyricsAnd as history slips out of view
Bated breath for the nine o'clock news
Reassembled right before your very eyes:
Innuendo, rumour and lies
Endless fun and games
Steal a headline, name some names
We're so proud that our press feels so free
To manipulate them, you and me
And as each campaign begins
To absolve us of our sins
I see freedom sold by the yard
It's so easy â€“ why make it hard?Embed
