The Age of Self LyricsThey say the working class is dead, we're all consumers now
They say that we have moved ahead â€“ we're all just people now
There's people doing 'frightfully well' there's others on the shelf
But never mind the second kind this is the age of self
And it seems to me if we forget our roots and where we stand
The movement will disintegrate like castles built on sand
They say we need new images to help our movement grow
They say that life is broader based as if we didn't know
While Martin Jacques and Robert Maxwell play with printer's ink
The workers 'round the world still die for Rio Tinto zinc
And it seems to me if we forget our roots and where we stand
The movement will disintegrate like castles built on sand
Castles built on sandEmbed
