The Wayward Wind Lyrics
In the lonely shack
By the railroad track
I spent my younger days
And I guess the sound
Of the outward bound
Made me a slave
To my wandering ways

And the wayward wind
Is a restless wind
A restless wind
That yearns to wander
And I was born
The next of kin
The next of kin
To the wayward wind

Oh, I met him down
In the border town
He vowed we'd never part
Though he tried his best
To settle down
Now I'm all alone
With a broken heart
 

The next of kin
To the wayward windEmbed
