Where Is the Highway Tonight? Lyrics
I would be feeling so low
She'd have a new place to go
She'd take me in her arms
And show me all her charms
Until my troubles were gone

Then when I left her behind
Never a tear could I find
Just a haunting melody
Coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight?

Where is the highway tonight?
Where are those old days
And crazy nights?

Now the house is
All quiet and still
Coyote howls on the hill
How far did I go
Before we said hello
Where is the highway tonight?
Darling, you'll always be mine
I'll never treat you unkind
But a haunting melody
Keeps coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight?

A haunting melody
Keeps coming back to me
Where is the highway tonight?Embed
