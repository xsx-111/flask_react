California Sunset Lyrics
I remember long ago
How I wondered where I'd go
While the blizzards
Cold wind and snow
Pounded outside my window

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye

Land of beauty
Space and light
Land of promise
Land of might
You're my home now
And it's true
California, here's to you

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye

California sunset
Going down in the West
All the colors in the sky
Kiss another day goodbye

The golden state!Embed
