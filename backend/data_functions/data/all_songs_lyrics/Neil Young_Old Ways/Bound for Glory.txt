Bound for Glory Lyrics
Out on the trans-Canada highway
There was a girl
Hitchhiking with her dog
Fireflies buzzing round her head
Like candles in the fog

He was three miles down the road
Trying to stay up
But he knew that he couldn't
She was looking
For a ride through the night
But out there, who wouldn't

They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two comets heading for a bed

She had a new way of living
New way of looking at life
He had an
'84 International and two kids
He left back home with his wife
He was tired of
Writing letters to himself
And living in the dark
She was open to suggestions
And some say
She had a broken heart
He had everything he wanted
Until it all
Turned out to be a job
One fallen asleep trucker
And a girl
Hitchhiking with her dog



Out on the trans-Canada highway
The sun came climbing up the cab
By the time it hit the window
They were waking up
From what little sleep they had
When that heat hit the blankets
They were looking
For love at second sight
Just staring in each others eyes
Finding it in the morning light
They were bound for glory
Bound for living on the edge
They were bound for each other
Like two blankets laying on a bed
