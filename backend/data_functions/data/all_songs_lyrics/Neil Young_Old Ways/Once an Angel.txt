Once an Angel Lyrics
Once an angel
Always an angel
You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever be

It's been six years now
Since my ring
Slipped on your finger
And those years have made
A better man out of me


There've been times when
I've treated you so badly
I've done things I know
You'll never understand
But you take me back
Turn your eyes
Towards the window
Where you hide the tears
You don't want me to see
 

You're as close to heaven
As I'll ever beEmbed
