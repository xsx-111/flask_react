Misfits Lyrics
Up in that new space station
Living Kennedy's dream
There was an automatic camera
Shooting elephantine

Well the crew was relaxing
Before the video screen
Watching old re-runs
Of Mohammed Ali

The voice of Houston calling
Brought them back to the scene
Except the sky is falling
Do you know what that means?

Out on that Texas sidewalk
Through the hotel mezzanine
There walked a see-through hooker
To a suite with two TVs
But by the elevator
She began to sneeze
With an attack so uncontrolled
It brought her to her knees
And then the hotel doctor
With nurse and stethoscope
Announced the worst is over
But for her there is no hope
Way down in South Dakota
On the Needles Highway
There's a lone red rider
On the road today
And though his war is over
He's fighting on anyway
Although he's seldom sober
He's drinking whisky all day
Down in that old box canyon
Where only misfits can go
He rides with no companion
But saloon and rodeo
Up in that new space station
Living Kennedy's dream
There's an automatic camera
Shooting elephantine
