Old Ways Lyrics
Old ways
It sure is hard
To change them
Come what may
It's hard to teach
A dinosaur a new trick
Lately I've been finding out
I'm set in my ways
Old ways
Can be your ball
And chain
Oh, I'm going to stop that grass
And give up all this drinking
Really going to make my life last
Clean up my whole way of living
Up until the party last night
I was a different man
But old ways
Got their way again
The economy was getting so bad
I had to lay myself off
Well, working was a habit I had
So I kept showing up anyway
Then one day
Things turned around
I got my back pay
Old ways
Coming through again
I got old waysEmbed
