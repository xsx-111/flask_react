My Boy Lyrics
Why are you growing up so fast
My boy?
Oh, you'd better take your time
Why are you growing up so fast
My son?

Almost time to live your dream
My boy
Oh, you'd better take your time
Almost time to make some plans
My son

Vacation gone, school is out
Summer ends year in year out

Oh, you'd better take your time
My boy
I thought we had just begun
Why are you growing up so fast
My son?

Why are you growing up so fast
My boy?
Why are you growing up so fast
My son?Embed
