Get Back to the Country Lyrics
When I was a younger man
Got lucky with a rock 'n' roll band
Struck gold in hollywood
All that time I knew I would
Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the country
Back in the barn again

Now when we hit the road
Big buses and trucks unload
After the curtain falls
Load up and then we all
Get back to the country
Back where it all began
Get back to the country
Back on the road again
