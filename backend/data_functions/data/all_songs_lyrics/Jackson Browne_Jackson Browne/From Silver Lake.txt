From Silver Lake LyricsDid you see our brother?
He was here the other day
But he only came to say that he was leaving
Did you see his lady?
She was looking where he'd gone
But she wasn't letting on that she was grieving
She's bound to go
Perhaps she'll find him waiting for his boat
In some city far away
She's bound to go
Lately I remember
Afternoons of smoke and wine
There was nothing we could find but peace and pleasure
And with a smile, he told me
That he wanted just to be
On his way across the sea no man can measure
He won't be back
And the sun may find him sleeping in the dust
Of some ruin far away
He won't be back
Early today, as I watched while the skyline was shaking
I heard a rumbling
Early today the mechanical city was waking
And I ran out stumbling, mumbling
Out through the laughter of children and dogs
Did you see our brother? (Someone who had been away)
He was here the other day (Suddenly came back today)
But he only came to say (And I allowed a hope)
That he can't breathe here (To stray into my mind)
Did you see his lady? (For a moment, face-to-face)
She was reaching for his hand (We looked back upon the place)
Just as if to tell her man (Long ago, he meant to chase)
That she can't either (Our careless time)
They're bound to go (Oh, what do you know?)
And the sun may find me running (Not what I've been feeling)
After them seeing something far away (The past is healing so slow)
We won't be back (My tomorrow, gone from sorrow)Embed
