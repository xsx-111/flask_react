Rock Me On the Water Lyrics
Oh, people, look around you
The signs are everywhere
You've left it for somebody other than you
To be the one to care
You're lost inside your houses
There's no time to find you now
While your walls are burning and your towers are turning
I'm gonna leave you here
And try to get down to the sea somehow

The road is filled with homeless souls
Every woman, child, and man
Who have no idea where they will go
But they'll help you if they can
But everyone must have some thought
That's gonna pull them through somehow
While the fires are raging hotter and hotter
But the sisters of the sun are gonna rock me on the water now

Rock me on the water
Sister, will you soothe my fevered brow?
Rock me on the water
I'll get down to the sea somehow
(I'll get down to the sea somehow)
Oh, people, look among you
It's there your hope must lie
There's a sea bird above you
Gliding in one place like Jesus in the sky
We all must do the best we can
And then hang on to that gospel plow
When my life is over, gonna stand before the Father
But the sisters of the sun are gonna rock me on the water now

(Rock me) Rock me on the water
Sister, will you soothe my fevered brow?
Hey, rock me on the water
Maybe I'll remember
Maybe I'll remember how
Rock me on the water
The wind is with me now
So rock me on the water
I'll get down to the sea somehow
(I'll get down to the sea somehow, ooh-hoo-hoo)
Rock me on the water (Ooh-hoo-hoo)
Rock me now (Ooh-hoo-hoo)
Rock me on the water (Ooh-hoo-hoo)
Rock me now (Ooh-hoo-hoo)Embed
