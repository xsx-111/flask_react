Song for Adam LyricsThough Adam was a friend of mine, I did not know him well
He was alone into his distance, he was deep into his well
I could guess what he was laughing at, but I couldn't really tell
Now the stories told that Adam jumped, but I'm thinking that he fell
Together we went traveling, as we received the call
His destination India, and I had none at all
Well, I still remember laughing with our backs against the wall
So free of fear, we never thought that one of us might fall
I sit before my only candle
But it's so little light to find my way
Now the story unfolds before my candle
Which is shorter every hour, as it reaches for the day
But I feel just like a candle, in a way
I guess I'll get there
But I wouldn't say for sure
When we parted we were laughing still, as our goodbyes were said
And I never heard from him again, as each our lives we led
Except for once in someone else's letter that I read
Until I heard the sudden word that a friend of mine was dead
I sit before my only candle
Like a pilgrim sits beside the wave
Now this journey appears before my candle
As a song that's growing fainter the harder I play
That I fear before I end will fade away
But I guess I'll get there
Though I wouldn't say for sure
Though Adam was a friend of mine, I did not know him long
And when I stood myself beside him, I never thought I was as strong
Still it seems he stopped his singing in the middle of his song
Well, I'm not the one to say I know, but I'm hoping he was wrong
I'm holding out my only candle
Though it's so little light to find my way
Now the story's been laid beneath my candle
And it's shorter every hour, as it reaches for the day
Yes, I feel just like a candle in a way
I hope I get there
But I'd never prayEmbed
