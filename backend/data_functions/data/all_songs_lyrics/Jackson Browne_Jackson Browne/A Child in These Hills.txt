A Child in These Hills LyricsI am a child in these hills
I am away
I am alone
I am a child in these hills
And looking for water
And looking for life
Who will show me the river and ask me my name?
Is there nobody here who will do that?
Well, I have come to these hills
I will come to the river
As I choose to be gone
From the house of my father
I am a child in these hills
I am a child
Chased from the gates of the city where no one had touched me
I am away
I am alone
I am a child in these hills
And looking for water
And looking for life
Who will show me the river and ask me my name?
Is there nobody here who will do that?
Well, I have come to these hills
I will come to the river
As I choose to be gone
From the house of my father
I am a child in these hills
I am a child
I am a child
I am a child1Embed
