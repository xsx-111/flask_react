Under the Falling Sky Lyrics
Warm and lovely mystery, fire smiling through
Before this moment fades away, I wanna know you
I got lightning in my pocket, thunder in my shoe
Have no fear, I've got something here I wanna show you

Hey, low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie while I bring it to you

It's a low road, a high wire going from me to you
And in your eyes, the distance left is closing
I got a feeling in my oceans, blood underneath my skin
That into your bright fields, this prison is opening

Hey, low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie while I bring it to you

Our shadows wake each day though they don't know why
They hope and try, live and die
So leave them in their frozen world, come and be my lover
If only for one stolen moment, we will live forever
Forever, hey
Warm and lovely mystery, can you hear the choir?
Voices can no longer hold my desire
Just abandon your sad history and meet me in the fire
Our angels wait to take us higher and higher
Higher and higher

Low, under the falling sky
Easily we will lie while I bring it to you

Higher and higherEmbed
