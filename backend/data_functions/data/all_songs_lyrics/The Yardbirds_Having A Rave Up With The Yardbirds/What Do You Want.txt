What Do You Want LyricsI want somebody here to tell me why
There's always smoke up in the sky
Please don't make me want to cry
Detail has not been seen
Summer trees should all be green
Plain and green as they have been
Sun don't ever change the scene
Please never let them die
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Sounds which soar above my ears
Will naturally precede in years
They only cause a flood of tears
I want to turn and run
Don't need someone to make my fun
Only need to see the sun
I will not go and cause harm
I cannot think that way
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
Sit spellbound by a flickering screen
Watch the ever changing scenes
Listen to the rising screams
Of children of today
Lock your doors and stay within
Upon your face the stupid grins
Penalty for unrealised sins
Committed on your way
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
What do you want?
