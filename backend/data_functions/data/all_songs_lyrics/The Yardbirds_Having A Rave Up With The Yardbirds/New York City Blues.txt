New York City Blues Lyrics(Keith Relf / Chris Dreja)
If you've ever been to New York City
You know what I'm talking about
Yes you do
Well, if you've ever been to New York City
You know what I'm talking about
They got such pretty little girls in that big town
Make a man wanna jump around and shout
I met a little girl there
She was about five foot eight
I said "I want you to love me."
She said "Why man, that'd be great."
So
I got long hair but
She took me back
Back to see her pad
But the first thing I saw when I arrived there
Was a big black shiny shotgun
In the hands of her dad
Alright now, this is how it was
Oh no!
Well alright!
I finally learned my lesson
Such a long time ago
Next little woman that I date
I've got to know, I've got to know her family too
Yes indeed, I gotta know her family too
But if you don't want to be filled full of shotgun holes
Mister, this song is just for youEmbed
