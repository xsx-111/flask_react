Respectable Lyrics
She's so respectable
Tell me, what kind of girl is this?
What kind of girl is this?
She's never ever been kissed
What kind of girl?
Rubbidy dub dub dub
What kind of girl is this?
She's never ever been in love
What kind of girl?
She's never been out in the moonlight
Watching the stars above

She's so respectable
Tell me, what kind of girl is this?
What kind of girl is this?
She's never ever been on a date
What kind of girl?
What kind of girl is this?
She's never ever been on a date
What kind of girl?
Yes, I'm telling you people
She's the kind of girl for me
She's so respectable
Did you love her?
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Did you hug her?
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Did you squeeze her?
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Did you kiss her?
No, no, no, no, no, no!

What kind of girl is this?
The kind of girl you just can't resist
What kind of girl is this?
The kind of girl who's never been kissed
Yeah, I'm telling you people
She's the kind of girl for me
She's so respectable
Wow!




Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall
Humpty Dumpty had a big fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Humpty together again
Tell me
She's so respectable
Tell me
Please tell me
She's the kind of girl for meEmbed
