Evil Hearted You Lyrics
Evil hearted you
You always try to put me down
With the things you do
And words you spread around against me

Evil hearted you
You kept, kidding me along
With your phoney smile
And with, your siren song smiling, beguiling
You lead me on 'til all hope's gone
Persuading, degrading on my knees I try to please
But I love you, just the same
And I want you to remain
By my side and you'll see
Just how much you mean to me

Evil hearted you
You always try to put me down
With the things you do
And words, you spread around against me about me

What would you
Do without me?
Smiling, beguiling
You lead me on 'til all hope has goneEmbed
