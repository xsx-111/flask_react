Someone to Love (Part One) LyricsI ain't got nobody
I ain't got no girl
I ain't got no woman
No-one in this world
Want you to hold me
Want you to love me
Want you to thrill me baby
Love me all night long
You're like a rattlesnake
Layin' on the floor
When I turn around now
You're gone right out the door
Want you to hold me
Want you to thrill me
Want you to hold me baby
Hold me in your arms
I ain't got nobody
No-one in this world
I ain't got no woman
I ain't got no girl
Want you to love me
Want you to thrill me
Want you to love me baby
Love me all night longEmbed
