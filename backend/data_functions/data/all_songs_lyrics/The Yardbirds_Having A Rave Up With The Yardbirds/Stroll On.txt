Stroll On LyricsStrollin' on
'Cos it's all gone
The reason why
You made me cry
By tellin' me
You didn't see
The future bore
Our love no more
If you want to know
I love you so
And I don't want to let you go
I'm strollin' on
Gonna make you see
I'm strollin' on
You'll find you really love me
I'm strollin' on
Be your turn to cry
I'm strollin' on
You wish you'd never lied
You're going to change your mind
But you ain't gonna find
Any more of my kind
I'm strollin' on
'Cos it's all gone
The reason why
You made me cry
By tellin' me
You didn't see
The future bore
Our lovin' no more
If you want to know
I love you so
I don't want to let you go
I'm strollin' on
Gonna make you see
I'm strollin' on
You'll find you really love me
I'm strollin' on
Be your turn to cry
I'm strollin' on
You wish you'd never lied
You're going to change your mind
But you ain't gonna find
Any more of my kindEmbed
