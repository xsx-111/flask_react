You Were Only Fooling (While I Was Falling in Love) Lyrics
You were only fooling
But I was falling in love

It's a story as old
As Adam and Eve
I was making love
But you were making believe
You lied to me with kisses
I tried to stop dreaming of
You were only fooling me
While I was falling in loveEmbed
