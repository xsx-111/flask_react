Low Lyrics
Old folks have the best view here
Grids with grass and tin roof glare, now
A victory dance when no one's won
The pension dreams have come undone

Tell me what it's worth
Yeah, what it's worth
Tell me what it's worth
Yeah, what it's worth

Every morning there's a halo hanging from a thread
Every morning there's a halo hanging from a thread

Call, response as egos flair
Bitumen reflects a stare down
Tiny king lays down a ruse
I'm just coming up here for air
I'm just coming up here for air

Tell me what it's worth
Yeah, what it's worth
Tell me what it's worth
Yeah, what it's worth
Every morning there's a halo hanging from a thread
Every morning there's a halo hanging from a thread


So low
Low
So low
Low
