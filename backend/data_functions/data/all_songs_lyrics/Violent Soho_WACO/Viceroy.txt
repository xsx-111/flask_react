Viceroy Lyrics
Killjoy
You're like a rhinestone pickup line
My drunk guitar's more fun than you'll ever be
Dear God
You're a monologue repeater
A computer is a better friend than I'll ever be (Than I'll ever be)

I ditched you Saturday night 'cause I want you to know
Take a photograph, it's going to last longer
I feel so temporary
Like some viceroy asshole, maybe

Yeah, king or the viceroy
Yeah, king or the viceroy
King or the viceroy

Oh God
Give it up, the charisma
This cold call waving is a sign of a weaker disease (A weaker disease)

I ditched you Saturday night 'cause I want you to know
Take a photograph, it's going to last longer
I feel so temporary
Like some viceroy asshole, maybe
Yeah, king or the viceroy
Yeah, king or the viceroy

I want it, I need it
I can't say, can't help it
God help me, God help me
I am my own and so are you

King or the viceroy
King or the viceroy
King or the, yeah
King or the viceroy
King or the
King or the shit2Embed
