Waco Lyrics
Cookie-cut it, control it
In a Waco on your own
Burn your mirror to the floor
I'll be waiting, stop bleeding
In a waiting room I own
In a Waco, I'll call

Yeah, I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming for a second son
Yeah, I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming for a second son

Dress it up right, camouflage it
In a Waco on your own
Wailing back that siren song
False message, I believe it
Need a prophet of my own
In a Waco, I'll call

Yeah, I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming for a second son
Yeah, I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming for a second son
Cookie-cut your desire, fucking liars
In a Waco no one wants
Sing a song for a profit, Meg Ryan
On a bully radio
Cookie-cut your desire, fucking liars
In a Waco no one wants
Sing a song for a profit, for a profit
On a bully radio

Yeah, I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming for a second son
Yeah, I'll be waiting
We'll be screaming for a second son

For a second son
For a second son
For a second son
For a second son
Second son
Oh, second, secondEmbed
