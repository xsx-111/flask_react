No Shade Lyrics
Tell me when you wanna get out
This ceremony's getting me down
Yeah, I'll treat him like a comic book
Oh, that's what you wanna say
That's all I gotta say
As you know you're right
You meet your maker every night

I'll save you, oh, saviour, no
I'll save you, oh, saviour, no
I'll save you, oh, saviour, no, I can't

All I'll say, pick me up or I'll levitate
Weigh me down with your pearly gates
As you know you can
Say what you want but I don't have a problem
All I'll say, pick me up or I'll levitate
Weigh me down with those pearly gates
As you know you can
Say what you want but I don't have a problem
Save me, saviour
Save me, save me again
The amateurs are at it again
Just give me all the rules to the game
Yeah, swipe left when you wanna get out
Oh, that's what you wanna say
That's all I gotta say
I don't feel so calm
A heavy hum that rattles your heart

I'll save you, oh, saviour, no
I'll save you, oh, saviour, no
I'll save you, oh, saviour, no, I can't

All I'll say, pick me up or I'll levitate
Weigh me down with your pearly gates
As you know you can
Say what you want but I don't have a problem

I'll save you, oh, saviour, no
I'll save you, oh, saviour, no
I'll save you, oh, saviour, no, I can't

Say what you want but I don't have a problem
Save me, saviour
Save me, save me again

All I'll say, pick me up or I'll levitate
Weigh me down with those pearly gates
As you know you can
Say what you want but I don't have a problem
Talk and say, pick me up or I'll levitate
Weigh me down with those pearly gates
As you know you can
Say what you want but I don't have a problem

I'll see you all on the flip side
Where ceremony is dead
As you know you can
Say what you want but I don't have a problem
Save me, saviour
Save me, save me againEmbed
