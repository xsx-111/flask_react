Evergreen Lyrics
Sometimes I stare
I swear I saw a flash
A tiger in the sky
Tonight, it's all a waste
Rhetoric and drunks
And bitumen to taste

I stumble while I'm staring (Fake)
I wish it was as simple as you make
I stumble while I'm staring (Fake)
I wish it was so simple

You tried all those times
You tried to connect
But faulted on the line
Inside, it's so contrived
Black box that knows nothing
But repeats it all again

I stumble while I'm staring (Fake)
I wish it was as simple as you make
I stumble while I'm staring (Fake)
I wish it was so simple
So simple now
So simple now
So simple now
So simple now

I stumble while I'm staring (Fake)
I wish it was as simple as you make
I stumble while I'm staring (Fake)
I wish it was so simple

So simple now
So simple now
So simple now
So simple now
So simple now
So simple now
So simple now
Simple now
Simple nowEmbed
