Slow Wave Lyrics
All those followers that pray all night and day
Chasing shadows, all the shadows, all the fame
And I know where you were
Dreading all the times that could have been

Is there some place where I can go?
Where I escape it all?
(Always I know) Yeah, let me find some fucking peace
(Always I know) Yeah, let it crash, just let it be
(Always I know) Some place I go
A slow wave I control
A slow wave I control

As they raised the flags across the melting streets
And wrapped a pretty gaze that kept 'em nice and neat
And I know where you were
It's all this hollow hum that makes me sick

Is there some place where I can go?
Where I escape it all?
(Always I know) Yeah, let me find some fucking peace
(Always I know) Yeah, let it crash, just let it be
(Always I know) Some place I go
A slow wave I control
A slow wave I control, yeah

Slow wave that I control
Slow wave that I control
Slow wave that I control
Slow wave that I control
Slow wave that I control
Slow wave that I control
Slow wave that I control
Slow wave that I controlEmbed
