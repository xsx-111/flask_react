Like Soda Lyrics
The heat, it drowned itself and all the roads
With rattles from all the pubs and pokies rooms
(The sound never goes)
They'd given up the workers' life
For a moment, it was clear and so precise
And I'll say

I don't mind, I don't care
I'll just say whatever
I don't mind, we don't care
We'll be here forever
And we don't mind and we don't care
We'll be here forever

'Cause I burnt my life and I branded my soul
Went to church and sung to a god
And it breaks my heart
This is the place where it starts
'Cause it's this suburban life and its grey paint world
Four-wheel drives and its peaceful mould
And I'll say it again
What ever happened to you, my friend?
And I'll say
I don't mind, I don't care
I'll just say whatever
We don't mind, we don't care
And we'll be here forever

It's the truth that keeps you warm
That lets you fall down
Like soda, it will pop
Yeah, let it fall down

'Cause I'd rather play pokies and a dead friend's game
Stay in a pub and drink warm beer
And I'll say thank you
For all the greetings and gratitude
'Cause we don't complain enough but we never shut up
Talk to computers and made-up drugs
And I'll say it again
What ever happened to you, my friends?
And I'll say

I don't mind, I don't care
I'll just say whatever
We don't mind, we don't care
And we'll be here forever
It's the truth that keeps you warm
That lets you fall down
Like soda, it will pop
Yeah, let it fall down
Let it fall down
Let it go


It's the truth that keeps you warm
That lets you fall down
Like soda, it will pop
Yeah, let it fall down
It's the truth that keeps you warm
That lets you fall down
Like soda, it will pop
Yeah, let it fall down
Let it fall down
Let it fall down
Let it go1Embed
