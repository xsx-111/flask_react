Holy Cave Lyrics
I remember times and all those nights
When we drove so far away
Take me there with fearless air
We can find a hideaway
And I'll be free, unwind the sheets
Let the breeze trickle like lead
And there's a place I'd like to hide
Anywhere, yeah, I don't mind

There's no light in my cave
My holy cave

All of these lights hurt my eyes
With a glaze I can't escape
Underground, where reason sound
A hundred miles, no noise complaints
When Jesus comes we'll all hold hands
And stare the sun right in the face

There's no light in my cave
My holy cave
And I'll find a hideaway
In a shadow that I make
And I'd like to fade away
In a cave that keeps me safe
I won't stay, I will go
I won't stay, I will go
I'll be right, I'll be there
I'll be there, yeah, I'll be right
I'll be there, I'll be there
Yeah, I'll be right, I'll be there
I'll be there, I will be

My holy cave
My holy cave
My holy cave (My holy cave)
My holy cave (My holy cave)
My holy caveEmbed
