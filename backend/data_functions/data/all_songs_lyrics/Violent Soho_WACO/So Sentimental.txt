So Sentimental Lyrics
The day the room swept clear
And let out all the smoke
And you think it collapsed
'Cause everything's your fault

It's who you know
It's who you know

Call me a brother (You know)
Call me a sister (You know)

You watched the waves
When the walls collapse around a heart
And you think you control
The progress, but

It's who you know
It's who you know

Call me a brother (You know)
Call me a sister (You know)
All the time we wasted on these plans (You know)
All the time we wasted on these plans (You know)
So sentimental
So sentimental

Call me a brother (You know)
Call me a sister (You know)
All the time we wasted on these plans (You know)
All the time we wasted on these plans (You know)
All the time we wasted on these plans (You know)
All the time we wasted on these plans (You know)Embed
