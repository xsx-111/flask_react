How To Taste Lyrics
Yeah!

She said
To kick it through the middle
I'm screaming through an interface
Please take me away to another place, yeah
She said
That Buffy was a loser
Sick of sitcom parables
Please someone tell me what to say

Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell me

What I see, what I know
Take the time, turn it slow
Why won't you mediate me?
City cries, city knows
Repeat the phrase, repeat it slowly
Why won't you mediate me?
She wants
To kick it marijuana
You filthy motherfucker
Please take me away to another place, yeah
She said
That plastic was so beautiful
Something like a monologue
Did someone tell me what to say?

Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell me

What I see, what I know
Take the time, turn it slow
Why won't you mediate me?
City cries, city knows
Repeat the phrase, repeat it slowly
Why won't you mediate me?

Turn it over
'Cause I'm letting go
Turn it over
'Cause I'm letting go
She says
She's nothing but a failure
But blames it on her mother
Can someone tell me what to say?

Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell me how to taste
Tell meEmbed
