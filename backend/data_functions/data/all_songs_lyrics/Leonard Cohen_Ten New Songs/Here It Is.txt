Here It Is LyricsHere is your crown
And your seal and rings;
Here is your love
For all things
Here is your cart
Your cardboard and piss;
And here is your love
For all of this
May everyone live
May everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
Here it is
Here it is
Here is your wine
And your drunken fall;
And here is your love
Your love for it all
Here is your sickness
Your bed and your pan;
And here is your love
For the woman, the man
May everyone live
May everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
Here it is
Here it is
And here is the night
The night has begun;
And here is your death
In the heart of your son
And here is the dawn
(Til death do us part);
And here is your death
In your daughter's heart
May everyone live
And may everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
And may everyone live
May everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
And may everyone live
May everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
And may everyone live
And may everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
Here it is
Here it is
And here you are hurried
And here you are gone;
And here is the love
It's all built upon
Here is your cross
Your nails and your hill;
And here is the love
That lists where it will
May everyone live
And may everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
And may everyone live
May everyone die
Hello, my love
And my love, goodbye
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it is
Here it isEmbed
