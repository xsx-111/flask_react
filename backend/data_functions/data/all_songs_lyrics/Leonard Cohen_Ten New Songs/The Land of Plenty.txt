The Land of Plenty LyricsDon't really have the courage
To stand where I must stand
Don't really have the temperament
To lend a helping hand
Don't really know who sent me
To raise my voice and say:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day
I don't know why I've come here
Knowing as I do
What you really think of me
What I really think of you
For the millions in the prison
That wealth has set apart -
For the Christ who has not risen
From the caverns of the heart -
For the innermost decision
That we cannot but obey -
For what's left of our religion
I lift my voice and pray:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
May the light in The Land of Plenty
May the light in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day
I know I said I'd meet you
I'd meet you at the store
But I can't buy it, baby
I can't buy it anymore
And I don't really know who sent me
To raise my voice and say:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day
For the innermost decision
That we cannot but obey
For what's left of our religion
I lift my voice and pray:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day
(May the lights, may the lights)Embed
