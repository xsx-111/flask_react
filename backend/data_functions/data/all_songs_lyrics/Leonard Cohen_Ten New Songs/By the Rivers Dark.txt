By the Rivers Dark LyricsBy the rivers dark
I wandered on
I lived my life
In Babylon
And I did forget
My holy song:
And I had no strength
In Babylon
By the rivers dark
Where I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me
And he cut my lip
And he cut my heart
So I could not drink
From the rivers dark
And he covered me
And I saw within
My lawless heart
And my wedding ring
I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me
By the rivers dark
I panicked on
I belonged at last
To Babylon
Then he struck my heart
With a deadly force
And he said, 'This heart:
It is not yours.'
And he gave the wind
My wedding ring:
And he circled us
With everything
By the rivers dark
In a wounded dawn
I live my life
In Babylon
Though I take my song
From a withered limb
Both song and tree
They sing for him
Be the truth unsaid
And the blessing gone
If I forget
My Babylon
I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me
By the rivers dark
Where it all goes on:
By the rivers dark
In Babylon1Embed
