For My Friends LyricsOne of us has to say he's sorry, yeah
Or we will never be friends again
Let's have a drink and talk it over
I wanna keep you for my date
We're here today and gone tomorrow, oh
None of us knows when life will end
I said some things that caused you sorrow
I wanna keep you for my friend
One of us has to say he's sorry
Or we will never be friends again
Let's have a little drink and talk it over, oh
I wanna keep you for my friend
We're here today and gone tomorrow, oh
None of us knows when life will end
I said some nasty things that caused you sorrow
But I wanna keep you for my friend, heyEmbed
