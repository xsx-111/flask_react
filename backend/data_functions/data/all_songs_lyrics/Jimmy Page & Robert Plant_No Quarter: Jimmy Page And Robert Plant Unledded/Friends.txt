Friends LyricsBright light, almost blinding
Black night, still there shining
I can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, he once told me
"You got love, you ain't lonely"
Now, she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh ooo, hey
Ooooh, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, just-a
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah
Met a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what I knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what I knew
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah
Ooooh, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just-a
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah
Ooooooooohhhh
Ohh yes, I
Ohh yeah
Ohh yeah
Ohh yeah
Ooooooh
Yeah
I'm tryin'
Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
Oooooooooooooh
Well ahhEmbed
