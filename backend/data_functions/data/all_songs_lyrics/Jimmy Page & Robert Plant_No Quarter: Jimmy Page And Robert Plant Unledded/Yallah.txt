Yallah Lyrics"Rendest rachib, rhud rhip zelp
Borachs un fun dehl noach, shochen zoap"
Ah, oh yeah
Ah, oh yeah
And your city will fall
And your corn won't grow
Through the silence from the temple
Hear the truth explode
It is written in the dust
It is whispered in the wind
From the wisdom of the father
Where the word begins
Ah, oh yeah
Oh ah, oh yeah
Ah, oh yeah
Ah, oh yeah
In the kingdom of gold
And the stolen chance
You can join the celebration
See the children dance
And the bells will ring
And the crowd will roar
And the sand in the glass
Gonna pour no more
Yallah, yallah, yallah, yallah, yallah
Yallah, yallah, yallah, yallah, yallah
Ah, oh yeah
Ah, oh yeah
And the rivers will freeze
And the hosts descend
Through the fires and the storm
To the bitter end
And the treasures and the gifts
And the words and truth
Will be cast to the heavens
With Oomrah fruit
Ah, oh yeah
Ah, oh yeah
And your city will fall
And your corn won't grow
Through the silence from the temple
Hear the truth explode
It is written in the dust
It is whispered in the wind
From the wisdom of the fathers
Where the word begins
Oh yeah!Embed
