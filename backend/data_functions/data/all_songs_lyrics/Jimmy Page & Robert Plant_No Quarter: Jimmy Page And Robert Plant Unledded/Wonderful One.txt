Wonderful One LyricsSo throw it down, Cleveland rain
The queen of love has flown again
To seek her daughter
Who must lie beside the thief
Whose golden tongue she will believe
Defies the order, ohh
Ohh, that is why
Ohh, that is why
Shall we dance and never stop?
Take my hand and stop the clock
From turning over
And spirit weave and spirit bend
In the move that has no end
We must follow
Ooohhh
Oh, show me your eyes
Oh, light of the son
Touch me with fire
My mind is undone
All life inspire
My freedom has come
I drift through desire
My wonderful one
When you do what you do
I can never, never, never let you go
When you feel the way you feel
You can never, never, never let it show
Oh, show me your eyes
Oh, light of the son
Touch me with fire
My mind is undone
All life inspire
My freedom has come
I drift through desire
My wonderful one
Ohhh, oh oh oh
Ah ah ah
Oh ah oh
Ohh  ohhh
So throw it down, Cleveland rain
The queen of love has flown again
To seek her daughter
Who must lie beneath the thief
Whose golden tongue she will believe
Defies the order
That is why
That is why
That is why
Ohhh, that is whyEmbed
