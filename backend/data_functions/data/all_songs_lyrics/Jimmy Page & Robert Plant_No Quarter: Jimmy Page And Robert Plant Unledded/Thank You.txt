Thank You LyricsIf the sun refused to shine
I would still be lovin' you
If mountains crumble to the sea, baby
There will still be you and me
Yeah!
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more
Little drops of rain, whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by, oohhh
My love is strong, with you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness - I'm glad

And so today, my world it smile
Your hand in mine, we walk the mile
Thanks to you, you know it will be done, baby, baby, oh yeah
'Cause you to me are the only one
The only one, the only one
Oh yeah
Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more
So if the sun refused to shine
Oh, I would still be loving you
If mountains crumble to the sea, baby baby hah
There would still be you and me
You and me, oh
Bom ba bom ba bom ba bom
Oh, I want to thank you
Bom ba bom ba bom ba bom
Oh yeah, I'm going to thank you
Oh yeah, hey

Oooh yeah
Come on, I know , baby
You know it will, baby
Oh, yeah, oh
I want to thank you
If you ask me why, baby
You know why, baby
Yeah, yeah, I want to thank youEmbed
