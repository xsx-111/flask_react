Wah Wah LyricsOoh, ooh, from my island home I feel a chance
Kiss the tired ghost of time and circumstance
Ooh, so give me peace of mind and let me dance
And bury all my pain of years beneath the sand
I said, ooh, ooh
Wah wah, wah wah, wah wah
Omrah heals, his wings I'd gladly wear
Laughing to the face of my anger and despair
Wah wah, wah wah
Ooh, ooh, give me peace of mind and lay me down
And bury all the pain of years beneath the sand
Wah wah oh yeah wah-wah
Wah wah, wah wah
Oh, so give me peace of mind and lay me down
And bury all my pain in years beneath the sand
Wah-wah, wah-wah
Omrah heals, his wings I gladly wear
Laughing to the face of anger and despair
Wah wah, wah wah
Wah wah, wah wah
Wah wah, wah wah
