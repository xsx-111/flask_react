No Quarter LyricsClose the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard, and don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowing cold...
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you
Ohhhh, they choose the path that no one goes
They ask no quarter, ohhhh
Oh, no quarter
No, no....
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The winds of Thor are blowing cold, ohhhh
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
To build a dream for me and you
They choose the path where no one goes
They, they ask no quarter
Ohh, ohh, no quarter
Ohhhh, misery without quarter
Ohhhh, the pain, pain without quarter...
Ohhhhh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh
Okay, okay
No quarterEmbed
