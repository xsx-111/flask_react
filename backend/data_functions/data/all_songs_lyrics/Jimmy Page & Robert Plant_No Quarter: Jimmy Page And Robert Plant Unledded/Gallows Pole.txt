Gallows Pole Lyrics
Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my friends coming, riding many a mile
So, friends, you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my dear friends
To keep me from the gallows pole?
What did you bring me to keep me from the gallows pole?

I couldn't get no silver, I couldn't get no gold
You know we're too damn poor to keep you from the gallows pole

Hangman, hangman, hold it a little while
I think I see my brother coming, riding many a mile
Brother, did you get some silver?
Did you get a little gold?
What did you bring me, my brother, to keep me from the gallows pole?

Brother, I brought you some silver
I brought a little gold, I brought a little of everything
To keep you from the gallows pole
Yes, I brought you to keep you from the gallows pole
Hangman, hangman, turn your head awhile
I think I see my sister coming, riding many a mile
(Oh whoo yeah)
Sister, I implore you, take him by the hand
Take him to some shady bower, save me from the wrath of this man
Please take him, save me from the wrath of this man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man

Hangman, hangman, upon your face a smile
Tell me that I'm free to ride
Ride for many a mile, mile, oh

Yes, you got a fine sister
She warmed my blood from cold
She warmed my blood to boiling hot to keep you from the gallows pole
Your brother, he brought me silver, your sister, she warmed my soul
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole
But now I laugh and pull so hard, see you swinging on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Whoo
I keep swinging
I keep swinging
I keep swinging
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
See saw Margery Daw
I'm gonna swing
See-saw knock at my door
I'm gonna swing, oh yeah
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows pole
Swingin' on the gallows poleEmbed
