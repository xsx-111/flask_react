Four Sticks LyricsOh, baby, it's cryin' time
Ah, baby, I've got to fly
I've got to try to find a way
I've got to try and find a way
Oh, baby, the river's red
Ah, baby, it's in my head
There's a funny feelin' goin' on, oh yeah
I don't think I can hold out long
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Oh, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby
How do you feel, oh yeah?
Yeah
Oh, baby, the rainbow's end
Ah, baby, it's just a den
It's just a den for those who hide
Oh, under love to depths of life, oh
And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, how do you feel?
When the rivers run dry, baby
How do you feel?
Ooh yeah, the brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
An' they can't hold the wrath of those who walk
An' the boots of those who march, oh yeah
Oh, I'll never get away from you, baby
Ooh, yeah
I'll never get away from you, baby
Ah
Ah, yeah
Oh, ah ah, yeah
Whoa yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah
Uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah, uh yeah
Yeah
Oh, oh
YeahEmbed
