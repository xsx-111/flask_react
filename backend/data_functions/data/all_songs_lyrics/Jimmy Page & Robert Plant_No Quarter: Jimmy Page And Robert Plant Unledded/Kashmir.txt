Kashmir LyricsOh, let the sun beat down upon my face
Stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
To sit with elders of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
But‚ all will be revealed
Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
Though not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh-hoh‚ whoa-oh‚ yeah
Oh hoh, yeah
Yes, yes‚ ahh
Oooh, oh baby, baby‚ I been cryin'
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, there's no denyin', there's no denyin', yeah
Oooh yes, baby baby, I've been flyin', oh yeah
Lord, mama, ain't no denyin', no denyin', no denyin'
Here's another one to ya
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Tryin' to find, yeah
Tryin' to find now, where I been, yeah
Pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Who heed the path that led me to this place
Yellow desert screen
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust floats high in June
When movin' through Kashmir
Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
'Long the straits of fear
Wha-oh, wha-oh, yeah
Whoa-hoh, whoa-hoh, ohh-oh-oh-hooooh
Well, when I want, baby, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, baby, when I see the way you stay, yeah
Well I'm down, mama, ooh, when I'm near
Please, please, please, tell me where I've been now
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Whooooooo, yeah-ee yeah
Whoo, yeah, I can take you there, take you there
Oh, my baby, ooh my baby, let me take you there, oh-oh
Ooh darlin', yeah, darlin', yeah yeah
It's what I want, it's what I need, oh yeah
It's what I want, it's what I need
It's what I want, it's what I need
It's what I want, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, feel
It's what I want, it's what I need
It's what I want, it's what I need
It's what I want, it's what I need
It's what I want, it's what I need, yeah
Thanks a lot, see ya later1Embed
