The Battle of Evermore Lyrics
The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
And side by side we wait the night
The darkest of them all
Oooohh oooooohhh
I hear the horses' thunder
Down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow
The apples of the valley hold
The seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget
Oooohh oooooohhh
The apples turn to brown and black, the tyrant's face is red
Oh the war is common cry
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know
Oooohh oooooohhh
Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow
The pain of war cannot exceed
The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black
Oh, sing as you raise your bow
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back, bring it back
Oooohh oooooohhh
Ahhhhhhhhh
At last the sun is shining, the clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes
Ahhhhhhh oooh  ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhh
Oooohhhh ooooohhhhh
Ahhhhhh
Ahhhhh
Ahhhhhhh
Ah ah ah ah
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Oohh
Ahhhh
Bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back
Ohh
Oohh, ahhhhh
Bring it, bring it, bring it, bring it
Bring it, bring it
Oh, yeah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah, ah ha hah
Ah ha hah
Ahhhhhhhhhh1Embed
