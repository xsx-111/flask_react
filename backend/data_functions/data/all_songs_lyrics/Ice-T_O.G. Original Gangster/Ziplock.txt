Ziplock LyricsOh yeah, Ha ha ha, i'm back, motherfucker
Ice-T, 1991, fool
Told you, you shoulda killed me last year
Once again I'm back in the place to be
The I, the C, the E, the T
I'll never get a Grammy, so fuck the G
All I need is crowd, and my M-I-C
Got a gangster ass DJ named Evil E
My record label's called Warner B
William Morris is my agency
I'll never go broke, I got property
Got a dope pitbull named Felony
Got four gold albums, so what you tell'n me?
Power was two, Iceberg was three
This one here shipped five hundred G
Now when I roll, I roll stupid deep
Benzes, Beemers, and boomin' Jeeps
I'm always strapped 'cause my money I keep
You move on the Ice and you're goin' to sleep
But when you see me walkin' down the street
You say, "What's up Ice?" and I say, "Peace!"
You give me a dap, I give you one back
Cause I ain't souped so forget about that
We might take pictures, sign an autograph
Kick a little flavor, have some fun and laugh
But step to me wrong, you might get shot
And wind up lookin' out a ziplocEmbed
