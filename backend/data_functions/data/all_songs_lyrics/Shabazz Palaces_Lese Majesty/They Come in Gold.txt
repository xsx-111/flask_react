They Come in Gold Lyrics
Vanity, I love you for myself
Me and always you and always never no one else
Sanity, a visage of my wealth
Lost but always found before the idols that I knelt
Strategy, the only way to cry
Keep it "do or die" and always think in terms of "I"
Reverie, some legends FuturesPast
Revelry instead for it renders hella fast
Capitol, a sound that's on the rise
It's slaking unrealized until essence has been razed
Sepulcher, a stage enlived by ghosts
Floating off with bags of the blood-encrusted dough
Farceur, quite simply it is him
It's black-ephilic petalistic palistrophic hymns
Darkness, the light that flashed to dare
Kingdom stellar lairs to which my kind is the heirs
Pasquinade, the jester's game of vice
The criers and corporates slang during heist

Them just walking around, just walking around
They just watching down, they watching down
What they talking about, they talking about
Don't you copping out, don't copping out
From a cold clod cut in a deep zone
A sunken ship with the ghost on
They put my seat in there, find a plaza
Under the chair hot, tucked in a dope spot
So the chrome tire screech every time we hit
We converse in ancient languages
If you come to see us this is what you get
Specialness, equipped for the long trip
And my jacket fits
And I'm packing it
So miraculous
Kinda statuesque
Legends carry like a killer's nerves
One picture's worth a thousand swerves
Facts stated to enhance what is pre-born
And dance with the white whale on the Pequod
And find your way fast when the road curve
It's a sea saw
Shall I go, shall I go
Look at me fall
Did I know, did I know, cus here
On a gilded wing
Rocking filthy rings
Go back go back, you should go back
Yeah you say cool, but it's old hat
Shall we raise a drink...
What the fuck you think?
For whom the angels sing
And my favorite color brown with pink rims
I believe to own his each
I'mma hold the chrome, a tight grip
They might trip boy, cause the way I talk shit get enjoyed
Them just walking around, just walking around
They just watching down, they watching down
What they talking about, they talking about
Ain't no copping out, no copping out4Embed
