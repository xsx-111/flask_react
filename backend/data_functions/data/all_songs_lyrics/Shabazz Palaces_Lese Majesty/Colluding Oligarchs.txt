Colluding Oligarchs LyricsSacred, spaces, still, exist
Safe from colluding oligarchs
(That's) grinding art from artists
Manipulating markets
(Just to) filling up their margins
They'll never touch the carpets
Quite elaborate ruses
Disremembered truths is
All for that filthy lucre
Styling photoshoot-ups
They'll never touch the carpets
They'll never touch the carpets
Carrying the losers
Like a fleet of cruise ships
Minimising chances
Thwarting troop advancements
(He's) indelibising fictions
(He's) preempting criticism
(We) simply trying to get on
Categorizers
Comprisor of self-mythologize
Soil fertilized with lies, which they're farming buyers with
Kings of disinspired
Who think
They deserve it just 'cause they tried1Embed
