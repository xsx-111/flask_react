New Black Wave LyricsNew, New, New, New
It's big out there, so bright
The glitterbeat made me rich
My ring sparkles, then I speak
I got more game than dough
I dress like diamonds, sharp
(Wave), New (Wave), New (Wave), New (Wave), (Wave)
We don't pose, or talk on moves
Stellar beings lock-stepped in groove
Who can plot absurder views?
We don't wait on a word from you
Find you (with) by the (grand) you get
Sham you simp, while we stand, you sit
You're the fake that we plan to get
Cause your mind didn't (man you) myth
And his aesthetic stuck in Europe
Corny fifths and a bunch of jewelry
More complex how my patterns map
Pluto queens and Saturn macs
My rap blap like when blammers hit
From the '6 where grandma's at
What he say, yo?
I don't call my gangster partners I gon' handle that
There is nothing you can do
Too much pressure to resume
A sonic glacier melting from the deep
The natives endless empty of disease
There was little to these stars
Some greed and connected ...
Midnight waters teem with the sharks
Look, there's another form of splash
New Wave (New Black Wave)
New Wave (All inclusive, cool exclusive)
New Wave
New Wave
New Wave
New Black Wave
New Black Wave
New Black Wave
