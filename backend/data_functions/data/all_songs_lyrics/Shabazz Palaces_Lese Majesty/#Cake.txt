#Cake LyricsEating cake
I’m having my cake and I’m eating cake
I’m having my cake and I’m eating cake
I’m having my cake and I’m eating cake
I’m having my cake and I’m eating cake
I’m having my cake and I’m eating cake
Yeah..
Lost inside a whirlwind
Eating cake
Syndicates of girlfriends
Eating cake
When I lay back in one's red coupe
Eating cake
She set my mood, shall I push back the roof?
Eating cake
And when I seen her whispers in her friends’ ear
Eating cake
His lust is just so sincere
Eating cake
Got the feeling she was right on
Eating cake
As the purveyor of the tight songs
Eating cake
In Brasilia, off the balcony
Eating cake
Resplendent, the foul veneer
Eating cake
Lord, forgive me all these pleasures sought
Eating cake
He said, "My son, just do as what thou art"
Eating cake
Will I ever have a clear mind
Eating cake
Simple pleasures equal good time
Eating cake
Metals, gold mine
Eating cake
Reverently gazing behind
Eating cake
I bet this is always on my mind
Eating cake
I’m having my cake and I’m eating cake
Why raise the sun and not dance in its light?
Make the gods laugh at such questions with delight
And inside, inside
I’m always late up high on pure blends
Eating cake
Trying to bend me is a dead end
Eating cake
Realms I rock it as a sorcerer
Eating cake
They gonna always slice my portion, bruh
Eating cake
Sent they gunbeat to erase your smirk
Eating cake
I get to dreaming ?? pink hearse
Eating cake
I drew it up and put it in a tray
Eating cake
Ooh it's filthy when I'm playing low
Eating cake
To all my hustlers, goons ???
Eating cake
Secret meetings in the stratosphere
Eating cake
Let’s feel in all the clear and let it live
The gift, walk way, let it waver
Why not savor the flavor
