The Ballad of Lt. Maj. Winnings LyricsMajor Winnings, cause I'm lost
Major Winnings, cause I'm 
Major Winnings, cause what you see is important
Blaze my , cause you, cause me
I find my kinfolks close of love
 just to find 
The sound was there since the first collision of stars in this sector of galaxy
We try to unreproduce six tension intervals
Primordial and scientifically sound ratio factors
This is all a dance show (dance sucka!)
This is Major Winnings, cause I'm in love, yeah
Blaze them finish, cause that is crush
I was there to move the light behind
Used to swear that's why she's all mine
Knapsack jacket,  chain, while the music blasts
Splashing on my macking
Get cash front in the backing
Who's asking?Embed
