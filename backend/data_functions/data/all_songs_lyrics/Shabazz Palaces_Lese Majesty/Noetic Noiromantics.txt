Noetic Noiromantics LyricsThere goes the rain and
Comes in a new light
The strange is strongest
I’ve had the pleasure
I get my head up
And follow blindly
I love you so much
Yeah, I’m just like you
I never thought that I would find else somebody
Who never thought that there was fine someone as me
I thought that maybe I felt all there is to be
Yet there’s a notion growing throughout me newly and it's that we
Should touch and agree
We should touch and agree
Touch and agree Embed
