Forerunner Foray Lyrics
Now you could feel all the tension
Building up at the convention
As the hustlers began to arrive
Must have been 9000 or more
That came through the door
The time was 11:55
There were pickpockets and dope peddlers, murderers and thieves
Card shark gamblers with aces up their sleeves
Bank robbers, burglars, boosters and pimps

One more blaster for the streets (hey)
One more blaster for the streets (hey)
One more blaster for the streets (hey)
One more blaster for the streets (hey)
One more blaster for the streets (hey)
One more blaster for the streets (hey)
I was born on the understanding
Stars slung 'cross the heavens
Some might call uneven
My kind call it leanin
Bitch boy, used to leavin'
Black star, mine's are schemin'
Fulfill all our dreamin'
That's what's up this evenin'
Extra vacant bangers
Brim broke chain swingers
Space cake, wars raise AK that nigga language
God smile on me favours, baby caught the vapors
Magic golden purp running like the filthy lakers
Self saviour, cream chaser in my Rod Lavers
W'crack baker super real just like '88 was
'92, in '92, in '92 we grinded thru
I was there, you're a square
These do not compare
If I'm there in the square you should come and stare
Bring her too, learn a thing or two how a king'll do
Off the cut, fill my coffers up, pop my collar up
Gum heap to these gunbeats she gone stir it up 
Black stallions pull my chariot
My heart's broken
Time travel fast and far to the last oceans
Pour potion, pimp pirate pushin' plush prose in
Curtains closin'
You ain't knowin' he was just posin'
Map clonin' that's a no-no where I be rollin'
The lead's hot, how I pop? See, now that's a cold one
Constellation roll-call it's a style sport
Winners take all, holler black for the strap's report
We respect Mohamed, peace be upon him
Connecting with the pirates
I know where to find it
These niggas shot Cyrus 
I'm the icest, wait up on the bottom on some fly shit
Priceless, but down there at the top I can't find shit (but garbage)
Every time I rock it's a tongue-kiss
E.H. Starling, forerunners and a pump fist
Shout out to the B C C C (constellation) OC, Cat & Stas, Dai, KB
Triple M ra ra C and KB
Bro Ro solo though Shaheed stay free 
(Shifting within the space it's been spoken, trust)
Dougie find heat where the cake be
Yung Ike all night with that boy Pete 1Embed
