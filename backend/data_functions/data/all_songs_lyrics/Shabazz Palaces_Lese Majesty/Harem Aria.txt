Harem Aria LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, mind
Mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Im not messing with your mind (mind, mind, mind, mind)
Im not messing with your mind
Im not messing with your mind
I dont have that kind of time (I'm busy, man)
Im not blind, I know you're fine
Im refined and I know the time (Thats great!)
There are higher beams to climb
Why in God's name would I grime?
There'll be riches should I grind
For essence in our inclines
That's me
Start on a flee
Runs with a C
Runs from the sea, you know
To your guidance she 
To your cries I am entwined and it's cool
You're a bird song visualized
(They started whispering to each other)
Is that resound? Is that tight?
Yes, the bad one's finally dying
And I'm always lit up in line
And my get ups they divine
You can search, but you won't find!1Embed
