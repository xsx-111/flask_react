Solemn Swears LyricsI bank in France like Jack Palance
I don’t eat pork like Mr. Roarke
I make them dance just at a glance
I set the tone like Al Capone
I bank in France like Jack Palance
I don’t eat pork like Mr. Roarke
I make them dance just at a glance
Just at a glance
I’m very nice like Jerry Rice
I make them dance just at a glance
I don’t eat pork like Mr. Roarke
I’m coming up like Donald Duck
I scream and yell like Samuel L
I’m often on like Chaka Khan
At a glanceEmbed
