Motion Sickness LyricsMoney, money, money, money...
You know, so I asked the cat, man, I said, man you know... Why’d you just do all that man? And the hustler said, "It’s a high climb to the gallows."
Crime related, activated
Trap located, strap to spray it
If you face the case, you faded
Player you’da never made it
And although the state delayed it
And you been equated
Sent you back up on the pavement
This one here is dedicated
The mistakes you’ve made
Is seasons grown
Castles raided
Fortunes blown
Sides was faded
Spouses gone
Much too later
Ten toes down cause to the gangsters rules you catered
Saw shit through a nigga that you knew was layed out
Ah money's no object
You spending cash out of all four pockets
Your girl rocking lockets
Your goons pop the rockets
Apply the big four link, you are not it
A hood pedigree of syndicates and felonies
A gene structure more illustrious than the bustas
He in the fast life ultimate
Grind, break rules, shake and bake, scratch and scrape
Don’t start no potential for sales
Fiends lined up like the crows on the fence at Ezell's
It ain’t hard to tell boy, you all aglow
Everybody knowin’ now you in the show
Retainers paid out
Trying to map the play out
The streets is undefeated
Really now there ain’t no way out
The world is closing up
Go re-up
Fix your cut
Feel your eyes
Sky your chains
And maybe you can style a truck
Meanwhile
Plots and capers
Lots of flavors
Knots of paper
Watch your neighbors
Wondering who’s real, who fake is
We in the breezeway
To be us it takes leaps of faith
The main question
You don’t ever ask it
History say: it's the casket or the basket
You like “Pass that, let's get blasted an' masked up”
The wiz kid who could poly like a diplomat
The last place you could think of where they’d get you at
80 miles from your sink where they sit you at
Life's a bitch, treat her good or she’ll get you backEmbed
