War Dance LyricsThere's an epidemic
Stirring passions in young hearts
Even the old campaigners
Have got it really bad
Well, we ain't seen nothing like it
Since coronation day
But when the street parties sound
I'm going underground
To keep the rabid hounds at bay
Oh, my, my, this war dance
A patriotic romance
No, we ain't seen nothing like it
Since coronation day
Oh, my, my, my
But when the ticker tape flies
And blood is on the rise
You know it's got you in its sway
You've got yourself a war dance
There's a cheap sensation
Keeping Fleet Street wide awake
Everyone wants a slice of
The jingoistic cake
And they're resurrecting Churchill
And bringing national service back
Fueling power and glory fever
Makes for a sicker Union Jack
Yeah, I'm talking about this war dance
A patriotic romance
And I know all you poets
Have seen it all before
About the stirring of those young hearts
Back in the first world war
Oh, my, my, this war dance
Patriotic romance
This war dance
Got a world war three dance
Oh, my, my, my, war dance
The stirring of those young hearts, young hearts
War dance, um, war danceEmbed
