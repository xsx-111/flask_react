Rook LyricsRook, rook, read from your book
Who murders who and where is the treasure hid?
Crow, crow, spill all you know
Is that my name on the bell?
Rook, rook, gaze in the brook
If there's a secret, can I be part of it?
Crow, crow, before I let go
Say, is that my name on the bell?
Soar up high, see the semaphore from the washing lines
Break the code of the whispering chimneys and traffic signs
What's the message that's written under the base of clouds?
Plans eternal, I know you know so don't blurt out loud
Rook, rook, by hook or by crook
I'll make you tell me
What this whole thing's about
Crow, crow, why can't you show
If that's my name on the bell?
On the wings of night, I fly too, above field and stream
My head bursting with knowledge 'til I wake from the dream
If I die and I find that I had a soul inside
Promise me that you'll take it up on its final ride
Rook, rook, gaze in the brook
If there's a secret, can I be part of it?
Crow, crow, before I'll let go
Say is that my name on the bell?
Is that my name on the bell?Embed
