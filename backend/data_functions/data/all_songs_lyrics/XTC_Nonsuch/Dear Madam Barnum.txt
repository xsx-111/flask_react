Dear Madam Barnum LyricsI put on a fake smile and start the evening show
The public is laughing, I guess by now they know
So climb from your high horse and pull this freak show down
Dear Madam Barnum, I resign as clown
You said I was the master of all I surveyed
But now I'm sweeping up
The last in line in your circus parade
Children are clapping as I fall to the floor
My heart's torn and broken and they just scream for more
If I'm not the sole fool who pulls his trousers down
Then dear Madam Barnum, I resign as clown
You tread the high wire between truth and lies
Your safety net just walked out
Much to your surprise
Strike up the band, love and let the show begin
For this is the last time I'm painting on a grin
If I'm not the sole fool who pulls his trousers down
Then dear Madam Barnum, I resign as clown
I resign as clown
I resign as clownEmbed
