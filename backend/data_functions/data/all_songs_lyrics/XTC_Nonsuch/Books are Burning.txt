Books are Burning LyricsBooks are burning in the main square
And I saw there, the fire eating the text
Books are burning in the still air
And you know where they burn books, people are next
I believe the printed word should be forgiven
Doesn't matter what it said
Wisdom hotline from the dead back to the living
Key to the larder for your heart and your head
Books are burning in our own town
Watch us turn 'round and cast our glances elsewhere
Books are burning in the playground
Smell of burnt book is not unlike human hair
Well, I believe the printed word is more than sacred
Beyond the gauge of good or bad
The human right to let your soul fly free and naked
Above the violence of the fearful and sad
The church of matches
Anoints in ignorance with gasoline
The church of matches
Grows fat by breathing in the smoke of dreams, it's quite obscene
Books are burning, more each day now
And I pray now, you boys will tire of these games
Books are burning, I hope somehow
This will allow, a phoenix up from the flamesEmbed
