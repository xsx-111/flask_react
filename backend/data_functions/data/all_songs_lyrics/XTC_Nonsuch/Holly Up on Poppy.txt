Holly Up on Poppy LyricsHolly up on Poppy
Canter never stop
She has escaped from the world
Where they bake beautiful girls
Holly up on Poppy
Trotting to the top
She talks and banners unfurl
Their secrets crayoned in swirls
Everyday I have to pluck up
Courage to look her in the eyes, the eyes of storms
Anyway I love to watch her
Ride and play the alchemy that love performed
Laughing
Holly up on Poppy
Canter never stop
She has escaped from the world
Where they bake beautiful girls
Every time I look at my watch
I'm reminded we are poor in hours per day
Every second spent with her's
A bulging wallet overstuffed with angels pay
Laughter!
Holly up on Poppy
