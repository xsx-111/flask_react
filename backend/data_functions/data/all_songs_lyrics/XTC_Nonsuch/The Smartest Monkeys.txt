The Smartest Monkeys LyricsWell man created the cardboard box to sleep in it
And man converted the newspaper to a blanket
Well you have to admit that he's come a long way
Since swinging about in the trees
We're the smartest monkeys
The smartest monkeys
The evidence is all around
Our brains are bigger, this we've found
The smartest monkeys
Well man discovered the park bench can make a transition
And the rubbish tip makes a valid form of nutrition
With discoveries like these, civilization agrees
To give itself a pat on the back
We're the smartest monkeys
The smartest monkeys
The evolution's plain to see
We're the dominant of the species
The smartest monkeys
We're the smartest monkeys
The smartest monkeys
We brought the caveman from the stone age
To the subways of the modern world
How they pack so many in?
Quick, call the Guinness Book of Records
Well you have to admit that he's come a long way
Since swinging about in the trees
We're the smartest monkeys
The smartest monkeys
The evidence is all around
Our brains are bigger this we've found
The smartest monkeys
The smartest monkeys
The smartest monkeys
The evolution's plain to see
We're the dominant of the species
The smartest monkeys
The evidence is all around
Our brains are bigger, this we've found
The smartest monkeys, okayEmbed
