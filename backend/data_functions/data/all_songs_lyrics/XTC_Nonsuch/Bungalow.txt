Bungalow LyricsBungalow
Bungalow
By the sea
Bungalow
In the sea air
Climbing rose
Time to spare
Luxury accommodation traps the sun
So we're working every hour that God made
So we can fly away
Saving it all up for you
Bungalow
Bungalow
By the sea
Bungalow
Silver shore line
In the gorse
You can be mine
Standing prime position for the town
Working for a vision through this lives
So we can fly away
Saving it all up for you
Bungalow
Bungalow
You wait and seeEmbed
