Humble Daisy LyricsHumble Daisy, form a chain to
Hold all battleships in check
Humble Daisy, knit a ladder
Down to nature's sunken wreck
Ragged rug unbound
Tangle trip the lovers
Royal barge aground
Brighter than all of the others on the windowsill
I'll sing about you if nobody else will
Humble Daisy, cast the milk and
Coins of morning's cash about
Humble Daisy, I fell down to
Heaven as you picked me out
We'll look up together
Browsing through some old sky
Sipping in the weather
You've got me dizzy, the fly that climbed the sugar hill
I'll lay upon you 'till somebody else will
Humble Daisy, we'll look up together
Humble Daisy, sipping in the weather
Humble Daisy, we'll look up together
Humble Daisy, sipping in the weatherEmbed
