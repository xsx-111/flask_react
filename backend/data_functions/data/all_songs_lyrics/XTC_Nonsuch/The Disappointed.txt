The Disappointed LyricsThe disappointed all shuffle round in circles
Their placards look the same
With a picture and a name
Of the ones who broke their hearts
The disappointed all congregate at my house
Their voices sob with grief
That they want me to be chief
Of the tribe with broken hearts
Once I had no sympathy
For those destroyed and thrown away by love
Seems your ring upon my finger
Signifies that I've become the spokesman of
The disappointed will bear me on their shoulders
To a secret shadow land
Where a somber marching band
Plays a tune for broken hearts
And day grows darker now
Everywhere, everywhere
The disappointed are coming in their millions
They're spilling from the bus
At a monument to us
Made of bits of broken heart
Once I had no sympathy
For those destroyed and thrown away by love
Seems your ring upon my finger
Signifies that I've become the spokesman of
The disappointed are growing every second
They blot the sun to black
At the bottom of the pack
I'm the king of broken hearts
The disappointed
The disappointed
The disappointed
The disappointed
The disappointedEmbed
