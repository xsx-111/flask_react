My Bird Performs LyricsFine art never moved my soul
No vintage wine and designer clothes
But my world shakes for me
My bird sings sweetly
A different kind of tinsel decorates my tree
Yeah my bird performs
A thousand Cheshire cats grin inside of me
Yeah my bird performs
There she goes
Shakespeare's sonnets leave me cold
The drama stage and the high brow prose
But my world shakes for me
My bird sings sweetly
The brightest fireworks are lighting up my sky
Yeah my bird performs
The cage is open but she's no desire to fly
'Cause my bird performs
There she goes
And you keep saying what you got
You keep saying what you got
Look out!
Fine art never moved my soul
My bird sings sweetly
No vintage wine and designer clothes
My bird sings sweetly
Shakespeare's sonnets leave me cold (My bird sings sweetly)
My bird sings sweetly
The drama stage and the high brow prose (My bird sings sweetly)
My bird sings sweetlyEmbed
