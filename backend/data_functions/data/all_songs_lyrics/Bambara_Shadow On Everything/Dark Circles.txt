Dark Circles LyricsA naked kid is singing
Up on the stage
He’s covered in paint and he’s barking
About the human plague
I walk over to the bar
I take a seat
Misanthropy can be so grating
Without a drink
Then I see you coming
Though a haze of sewer steam
Neon glowing in the night
Red words: "Red Tide"
Shining in your eyes
You come out of the cold
The cold follows you in
I’ve been waiting for an hour now
But who’s counting?
Lips mouthing hello
Dark circles ‘round your eyes
You sit down and I tuck my hand
Between your thighs
Tell me more about your hometown
The restaurants where you worked
The amusement park on the haunted lot
Your art friends who sucked each other off
For the rich man on the hill
Buying meth from the Doe-Eyed Girl
Skinny-dipping in the desert heat
Coyote choirs howling from their traps
Your first love who got cut in half
From falling on the tracksEmbed
