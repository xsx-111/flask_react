Steel Dust Ocean LyricsWe’re sneaking through the night
And there’s no talking
In this dream I hear a bell
As we take the driveway around the hill
And we keep walking
I see you in moon patches
Wading naked in the lake
I feel the old man watching, but I
Keep going anyway
You’re struggling through the waves now
In slow motion
And I see you as a little calf
With a lasso round your neck
In the Steel Dust Ocean
And I know you’re leaving
I see the change in your face
And I want to go with you, but I know
I’ll be alone any placeEmbed
