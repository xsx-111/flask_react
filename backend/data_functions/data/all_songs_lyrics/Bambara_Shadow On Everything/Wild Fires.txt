Wild Fires Lyrics
I woke up today
I woke up today and I saw you
Woke up and I saw you
Stuffing leaves in your mouth
You were mumbling something
About wild fires
And how they sound

Come inside
Come inside

I woke up today and I saw you
Woke up and I saw you
Digging a hole in the ground
You were down on your hands and knees
Forming all the dirt into a mound
On top you made a house of sticks
Round a fat tick plucked from your scalp

Come inside
Come inside
It’s too cold out there
Come back to bed

I woke up last night and I saw you
Standing out in the moonlight
Tying a noose with a vine
I said mostly to myself:
“Is that thing for you or is it mine?”
It’s too cold out there
Come back inside the bedroom
You said: “It’s colder next to you.”Embed
