Martin LyricsJust want to tell ya 'bout Martin
Cause nobody I know's got a brother like him
As kids we could never be parted
The neighbours all knew us as the terrible twins
At school some kids was always looks for a fight
And Martin never wanted a fuss
Ol' Big Mouth Brown thought he'd push him  around
Being three year older than us
So I smashed him in the teeth with a cloakroom stool
Got six of the best and suspended from school
But it was worth with a brother like Martin
(Martin)
It was worth it with a brother like him
We used to nick motors for a joy ride
'Till we rammed a Black Mariah in this XJ 6
To give me brother time to get clear
I had to punch a few policemen before I was nicked
Got borstal for taking and driving away
And beating up the boys in blue
But Martin never missed a single visiting day
Hitched from Clapham to Crewe
With all me racing mags and the little bits of news
Smuggling in ciggies and a little bit of booze
No one ever had a brother like Martin
No one ever had a brother like him
Look, people get the wrong impression with Martin
I know he didn't mix much but he's no snob
The weekend I got out of remand home
He got Uncle Ruby to find me this job
And back at me Nan's he'd repainted my room
And bought me a brand new carpet
There was all me old records and books on a shelf
And a secondhand telly from the market
You can get a bit hard when you've been inside
But I hugged the old bastard and I almost cried
Cos no-one ever had a brother like Martin
No-one ever had a brother like him
(Cos no-one ever had a brother like Martin
No-one ever had a brother like him)Embed
