2-4-6-8 Motorway LyricsDrive my truck midway to the motorway station
Fairlane cruiser coming up on the left hand side
Headlight shining, driving rain on the window frame
Little young Lady Stardust hitching a ride
And it's 2-4-6-8, ain't never too late
Me and my radio truckin' on through the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light
Whiz kid sitting pretty on your two-wheel stallion
This ol' ten-ton lorry got a bead on you
Ain't no use setting up with a bad companion
Ain't nobody get the better of you-know-who
2-4-6-8, ain't never too late
Me and my radio truckin' on through the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
That same old motorway sun coming up with the morning light
Well, there ain't no route you could choose to lose the two of us
Ain't nobody know when you're acting right or wrong
No one knows if a roadway's leading nowhere
Gonna keep on driving home on the road I'm on
And it's 2-4-6-8, ain't never too late
Just me and my radio truckin' on through the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light
2-4-6-8, ain't never too late
Me and my radio truckin' on through the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light
That same old motorway sun coming up with the morning light
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I said it's 2-4-6-8, ain't never too late
Just me and my radio truckin' on through the night
3-5-7-9 on a double white line
Motorway sun coming up with the morning light
And it's 2-4-6-8, ain't never too late
Me and my radio truckin' on through the night
3-5-7...1Embed
