Long Hot Summer LyricsHey Joe, get up and go
Wouldn't like to tell you twice
Hey mac, get off my back
Didn't ask your advice
There's all this heat
Out in the street
Telling us to move along
It's gonna be a long hot summer
From now on
Hey man, I don't understand
We ain't hardly bothering you
Say fag, you're just a drag
We ain't nearly finished with you
There's all this heat
Out on the beat
Telling us we don't belong
It's gonna be a long hot summer
From now on
Hey Dan, give us a hand
We won't make it alone
But we can all make a stand
Next time the whistle's blown
So get your feet
Out on the street
When you hear the heat is on
It's gonna be a long hot summer
From now on Look out sisters
Look out brothers
We won't be fooled againEmbed
