Man You Never Saw LyricsHave you heard an ugly whisper
Is the rumour really true
Just in time, we're next in line
They're really after me and you
Since the demonstration
Clamping down on every side
Rounding up the kids at random
Army curfew every night
Don't repeat this conversation
Don't let on we've met before
Try and make like I'm a stranger
I'm a man you never saw
Church police were round this morning
And the army's on our track
Took away my books and papers
Only just got out the back
I just called in to tell you
That your place is being watched
Don't go into work tomorrow
Try and make it down the docks
Don't repeat this conversation
Don't let on we've met before
Try and make like I'm a stranger
I'm a man you never saw
Dump your car and burn your letters
Smash your glasses, cut your hair
Buy a suit and take a raincoat
When you go, don't tell us where
Take a look outside my window
I don't recognise that van
Someone standing in the doorway
Better make it while you can
Don't repeat this conversation
Don't let on we've met before
Try and make like I'm a stranger
I'm a man you never sawEmbed
