Longing for Fire Lyrics
Flying with the guys
And my longing for fire
Crying like last night
The night which brings me higher

In search of light
Escape the night one day
She's lost in time
Just miss so high
Time's passing by and I'm
I'm on my way

In search of light
Escape the night one day
She's lost in time
Just miss so high
Time's passing by and I'm
I'm on my wayEmbed
