Evening Wind Lyrics
A summer day is gone
Listen to the evening wind
Singing tunes of tamarind
Into the setting sun
You lie in twilight sleep
Dreaming colors deep
Today all life is gone

Look at the golden chalice
Plight broken on the ground
Green fire blazin' 'round
Where are your friends
You see all hope
Lying broken on a slope
Today all life is gone

Have you ever listened to the evening wind
To the gentle breeze and its thoughts
Have a listen and you will see, my friend
Wind is telling you a truthEmbed
