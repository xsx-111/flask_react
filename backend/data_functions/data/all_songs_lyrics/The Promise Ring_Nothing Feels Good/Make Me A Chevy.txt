Make Me A Chevy LyricsMake me a Chevy because an old Chevy made me
And a young one makes me a Chevy
Where would I go and how do I explain your body to the rest of my day
I'm not as good as the interstates are I just can't take you that far
Maybe Dick Clark and Davey move a car
But not as good as the interstates are
I can't take you that far away
So stayEmbed
