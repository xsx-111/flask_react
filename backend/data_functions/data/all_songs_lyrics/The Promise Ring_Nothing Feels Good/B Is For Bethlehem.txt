B Is For Bethlehem LyricsYour neck is craned a lazy quarter
Of the distance down your back
Creating a reason for the blood to go there
To know now my only veins
Are your hands across my back
Where you're resting
Where you, when you rest
Broke from the sins of our shoulders
Run its motors to waters to struggle and end
Now my only veins
Are your hands across my back
Where you're resting
Where you, when you rest
Cried at the funeral because you can go anywhere
To be hallowed by thy name and mine name ours
I'm dying to try to stop the wind
Leave the leaves left, leave and leave
To be hallowed by thy name and mine name ours
It's hours to be where
B is for Bethlehem where Jesus was a fisherman
I know he starts and finishes men but I don't know why
Jesus was a fisherman
Fishing men from the Devil's hands
And the Devil was made red to live a damned life
The red in your face is touchable
To the blues and the muscles in a memory
Where I have lost my voice
Now I smell like paint again, again, again
My bends they bend my anchor
To pull people out of the Bible and stand in the rain
And be where
B is for Bethlehem where Jesus was a fisherman
I know he starts and finishes men but I don't know why
Jesus was a fisherman
Fishing men from the Devil's hands
And the Devil was made red to live a damned life
B is for Bethlehem where Jesus was a fisherman
I know he starts and finishes men but I don't know why
Jesus was a fisherman
Fishing men from the Devil's hands
And the Devil was made red to live a damned life
Jesus was a fisherman
Jesus was a fisherman
Jesus was a fisherman again
B is for Bethlehem
B is for Bethlehem
B is for Bethlehem again, againEmbed
