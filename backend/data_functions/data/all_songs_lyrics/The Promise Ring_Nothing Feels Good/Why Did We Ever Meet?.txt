Why Did We Ever Meet? Lyrics
Your hair pinned up in circles
Worn like a widow to second the motion of second nature
Like two rafts knotted and you're knotted and still where sound is lost and found
But I fear it's all just coming back to me
And I fear that it's all just coming back
It's all coming back, It's all coming back to me
Under that threat of sky we lie together
Why care about the weather?
It only ends - it ends in darkness

You, you're always, you're -
Always dressed and buttoned up
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba da ba bap
Do do do do do do do do and you -
You, you're always, you're -
Always dressed and buttoned up
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Do do do do do do do do do do -

And between 19, 19 and 40
For the tea it will have changed me
And turning from the invading light on my -
My naked room, my naked room
Our coffee stains and dusty coughing
You, you're always, you're -
Always dressed and buttoned up
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba da ba bap
Do do do do do do do do and you -
You, you're always, you're -
Always dressed and buttoned up
Ba ba ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Do do do do do do do do and youEmbed
