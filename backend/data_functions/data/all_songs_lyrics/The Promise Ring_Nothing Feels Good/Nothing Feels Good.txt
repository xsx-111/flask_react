Nothing Feels Good LyricsI don't know East Texas from Louisiana
And I don't know Alabama
Or where Atlanta lies, where Atlanta is tonight
And Indianapolis summers in park and recreation pools
And carsick vacations in size eleven
In "I'm going to heaven" shoes
And I don't know God
And I don't know anyone
And I don't know God
And I don't know if anything at all
Will be all right
I don't know Billy Ocean, I don't know the ocean floor
I don't own any albums, I don't know anything
I don't go to college anymore
I don't know God
And I don't know anyone
And I don't know God
And I don't know if anything at all will be all right
I've got my hands on the one end
And I don't know where to put themEmbed
