Love Action (I Believe In Love) LyricsWhen you're in love, you know you're in love
No matter what you try to do
You might as well resign yourself
To what you're going through
If you're a hard man or if you're a child
It still might get to you
Don't kid yourself, you've seen it all before
A million mouths have said that too, ooh
I've had my hard times (hard times!) in the past
I've been a husband and a lover too
I've laid alone and cried at night
Over what love made me do
And the loved ones who let me down
And couldn't share my point of view
But this is Phil talking, I wanna tell you
What I found to be true
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action
I believe, I believe what the old man says
Though I know that there's no Lord above
I believe in me, I believe in you
And you know I believe in love
I believe in truth, though I lie a lot
I feel the pain from the push and shove
No matter what you put me through
I'll still believe in love, and I say
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action
Love action
Love action
Love action
I love your distraction
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action
I love your love action
Lust's just a distraction
No talking, just looking
Watching your love action1Embed
