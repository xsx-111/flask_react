Shoot the Water LyricsSilence
Silence speaks for you
Silence speaks for you
And diamonds
Diamonds shine like you
Diamonds shine like you
Stop that, stop it, stop it as a panther
Stop that, stop it as a panther
Silence
Silence speaks for you
I want your blood
I want it in my hair
I want your blood
I want it in my hair!
Shoot the water
Shoot the water
Shoot the water baby I've been found!
Shoot the water
Shoot the water
Shoot the water baby I've been found!
Shame
Shame is your name
Shame is your name
And desperate
Desperate things can't measure it
Desperate things can't measure it
Silence speaks for, silence speaks for
Silence speaks for you
I want your blood
I want it in my hair
I want your blood
I want it in my hair!
Shoot the water
Shoot the water
Shoot the water baby I've been found!
Shoot the water
Shoot the water
Shoot the water baby I've been found!
I've been found!
I've been foundEmbed
