Darken Her Horse Lyrics
Ride her darken horse
Her tempers lie untold
It's always the same
It's always the same
A customary trend
The course is laid to play
I noticed it's there
I noticed it's there
I noticed...

Shoot into the darkness with your hands
Shoot into the darkness with your hands

Ride her darken horse
Her tempers lie untold
It's all insane
It's all insane
A monster for a friend
A liar to depend
I noticed it's there
I noticed it's there
I noticed...
Hold her by the reins
The moon isn't far
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay

Nothing stable, nothing patient here

Ride her darken horse
The pathway to the end
She's all alone
She's all alone
Her trust was never there
It's yours she needs to hear
I noticed it's there
I noticed it's there
I noticed...

Hold her by the reins
The moon isn't far
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay
Hold her by the reins
The moon isn't far
Hold her by the reins
It's worth it to stay

Nothing stable, nothing patient here1Embed
