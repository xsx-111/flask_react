Hate Crime LyricsAnother thing that I would compromise
Another thing that I would compromise to say
At first
Don't wanna sympathize
Don't wanna sympathize
With the darkness
With the darkness
Don't wanna sympathize
Don't wanna sympathize
With the darkness
With the darkness
Who signed the consent forms?
Who signed? Who signed?
Who signed the consent forms?
Who signed? Who signed?
It isn't something I would put you through
To be afraid and left for black and blue
At first
It's hard to recognize
It's hard to recognize
From my apartment
From my apartment
I couldn't sympathize
I wouldn't sympathize
With the darkness
With the darkness
Who signed the consent forms?
Who signed? Who signed?
Who signed the consent forms?
Who signed? Who signed?
Who would, who would
Who would be so harmful to you?Embed
