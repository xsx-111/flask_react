Lose It Lyrics
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
I never knew you, I never knew
I never knew you, I never knew
Your body's harmful, the very shape
The cracks are deeper, on every plate


Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
I get impatient, with every word
The more you ask me, the more I've heard
This is a thirst that I've never had
I've never bled for another man


Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
Don't wanna lose you, don't wanna lose
My face screams
My face screams
My face screams
Without an emotion
 x4
In the darkness comes, another, another
Hold her by the thumbs, the other, the other
