Pianix LyricsIs that your hand I feel?
Is it true, it's real?
I didn't have a cause
Nor my impulse
Paintings of the portraits I love
Portraits, I love you
You can stay
Is that your hand I feel?
I know that it's real
I didn't have a cause
And nor an impulse
Painted by the portraits I love
Portraits, I love you
You can stayEmbed
