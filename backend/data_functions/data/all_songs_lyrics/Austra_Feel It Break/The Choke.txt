The Choke LyricsThe thing that leaves you in the darkness is her
The thing that maybe once seemed harmful is her
The lamp, the car, the door
The lamp, the slip, the floor
You wouldn't eat unless I told you so
I never knew that you would burn it so slow
The mouth, the breath, the smoke
The mouth, the breath, the choke
(Niagra) 
Who would have thought
I'm maybe caught
Who would have thought
I'm maybe caught
Lover, don't do anything!
The choke
Lover, don't do anything!
The choke
The thing that leaves you in the darkness is her
The thing that maybe once seemed harmful is her
The lamp, the car, the door
The lamp, the slip, the floor
Is this attention just a burden to bear?
A sick reminder that I didn't care?
The mouth, the breath, the smoke
The mouth, the breath, the chokeEmbed
