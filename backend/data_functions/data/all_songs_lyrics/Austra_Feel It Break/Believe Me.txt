Believe Me LyricsMother
Everything you did before you hit the ground I found
Believe me, you need me more
All I've been
Mother
Everything you did before you hit the ground I found
Believe me, believe me, I'm mad
Hunter, please sir
Don't expect the world when you've got me
Believe me, believe me, I'm mad
Hunter, please hurt her
Hunter, please hurt her
Believe me, believe me, I'm mad
Believe me, believe me, I'm mad
Hunter, please sir
Don't expect the world when you've got me
Hold on, it's my island
It's my island, it's my name
Hold on, it's my island
It's my island, it's my nameEmbed
