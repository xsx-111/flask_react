The Villain Lyrics
You say I'm not afraid but I linger
The pleasure's still the same, she gets sicker

I'll break your heart if I can't stay
It is more than I might be safe to play

It's hidden in the clouds where I can see
How easily my mind could just break free

Arise sweet demon and have your say
I deserve nothing, but fortune's way

Arise sweet demon and have your say
I'll break your heart, but I can't stay

Tenderly my garden grows there
Carefully, I'll care and wait there
I can't be sure this round will solve it
I can't be sure this round will solve it2Embed
