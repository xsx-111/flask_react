Young and Gay Lyrics
The dark night
It calls me
Right into my palm, this thing that I will know
Bleeding in my chest, the fool in you will know

In my head
In my head
In my head
The fool in you will know

These wings I spread
It lead my face towards
What isn't for the search that I respect
Amongst the village where the war is ever left

In my head
In my head
In my head
The fool in you will know

In my head
In my head
In my head
The fool in you will knowEmbed
