Identity LyricsEnter the floodgates and breathe
I want to be true, there's no need
The pressure you built on my head and my shoulders
It threatens to be what I'm seeing
In you
Capture my breath, don't mislead
Sink to my head, it's the need
You are my headache, my seed in the middle
And I won't be ready to live
For you
Mother won't battle the name
Other get's stable that way
Mother won't battle the name
And other gets stable that way
Creature don't keep me from dreaming
A fantasy life, that's worth keeping
Strangers don't know me, but love to control me
It's you that their hoping to see
From them
Mother won't battle the name
Other get's stable that way
Mother won't finish the game
And other gets stable that way
Come, let's play
Come, let's play
Mother won't battle the name
While other get's stable that way
Mother won't finish the game
And other gets stable that wayEmbed
