Beat and the Pulse Lyrics
Hundred angles lost
Fleeing from the beat and the pulse
Loving like a fool
Play it full of heart and the soul
And the soul

Capture something red
Paste it to the edge of your bed
Someone will be there
Someone who will know what it says
What it says

Feel it break
Feel it break
Nothing's a mistake, or you
Feel it break

Elevate your fingers
Motion makes it hard to write
Steel words are abrasive
Yours are making me feel right
Feel right
Feel it break
Feel it break
Nothing's a mistake, or you
Feel it break3Embed
