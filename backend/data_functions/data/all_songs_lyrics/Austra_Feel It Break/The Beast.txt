The Beast LyricsThe morning that I was born again
I was made into a beast
Am I free now, am I at peace?
Is that the ground below me, or your feet?
The morning I saw your face again
I was made into a beast
Am I free now, am I at peace?
Is that the ground below me, or your feet?
And I'll break my head over you
I swear (?)Embed
