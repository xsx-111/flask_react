The Future LyricsTo the end I'll never know
Temperatures are rising slow
I came so hard, in your mouth
I saw the future, it was dark
I know I'm not afraid
I'm consumed
And another thing
I'm still bruised
So it seems you're not my friend
Anything is better than
I came so hard, in your mouth
I saw the future, it was dark
I know I'm not afraid
I'm consumed
And another thing
I'm still bruised
Nobody knows what I bringEmbed
