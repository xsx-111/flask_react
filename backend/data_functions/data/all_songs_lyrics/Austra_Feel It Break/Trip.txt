Trip LyricsThe blood is my foe
A bet of my own
I noticed
I'm impaired (?)
The blood is rushing down
The blood is rushing down
I'm in (?)
I noticed in the air
Your words are true but fair
I know this
It got me bad
The blood is rushing down
The blood is rushing down
I'm in
Keep the valley(?) broken
Keep the valley broken
Keep the valley broken
Keep the valley broken
The blood is my foe
A bet of my own
I know this, it got me bad
The blood is rushing down
The blood is rushing down
I'm in
I noticed in the air
Your words are true but fair
I know this
It got me bad
The blood is rushing down
The blood is rushing down
I'm in
Keep the valley broken
Keep the valley broken
Keep the valley broken
Keep the valley broken
The blood is my foe
A bet of my own
I know this, it got me bad
The blood is rushing down
The blood is rushing down
I'm inEmbed
