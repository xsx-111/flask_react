Jonah LyricsHalf an hour, change your strings and tune up
Sizing the room up, checking the bar
Local girls, unspoken conversation
Misinformation plays guitar

They say Jonah, he was swallowed by a whale
But I say there’s no truth to that tale
I know Jonah
He was swallowed by a song
No one gives their dreams away too lightly
They hold them tightly, warm against cold
One more year of traveling ‘round this circuit
Then you can work it into gold

They say Jonah, he was swallowed by a whale
But I say there’s no truth to that tale
I know Jonah
He was swallowed by a song
Here’s to all the boys who came along
Carrying soft guitars in cardboard cases all night long
And do you wonder where those boys have gone?
Do you wonder where those boys have gone?Embed
