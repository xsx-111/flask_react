Oh, Marion LyricsThe boy's got brains, he just don't use them that's all
The boy's got brains, he just refuse to use them and that's all
He says, "The more I get to thinking
The less I tend to laugh"
The boy's got brains, he just abstains
The boy's got a heart but it beats on his opposite side
It's a strange phenomenon, the laws of nature defied
He said "It's a chance I had to take
So I shifted my heart for its safety's sake"
The boy's got a heart but it beats on his opposite
Oh, Marion, I think I'm in trouble here
I should have believed you when I heard you saying it
The only time that love is an easy game
Is when two other people are playing it
The boy's got a voice but the voice is his natural disguise
Yes, the boy's got a voice but his words don't connect to his eyes
He says, "Ah, but when I sing
I can hear the truth auditioning"
The boy's got a voice but the voice is his naturalEmbed
