One Trick Pony Lyrics
He's a one trick pony
One trick is all that horse can do
He does one trick only
It's the principal source of his revenue
And when he steps into the spotlight
You can feel the heat of his heart come rising through

See how he dances
See how he loops from side to side
See how he prances
The way his hooves just seem to glide
He's just a one trick pony. that's all he is
But he turns that trick with pride

He makes it look so easy, he looks so clean
He moves like God's immaculate machine
He makes me think about all of these extra moves I make
All of this herky-jerky motion and the bag of tricks it takes
To get me through my working day
One-trick pony

He's a one trick pony
He either fails or he succeeds
He gives his testimony
Then he relaxes in the weeds
He's got one trick to last a lifetime
But that's all a pony needs (that's all he needs)
He look so easy, he looks so clean
He moves like God's immaculate machine
He makes me think about all of these extra moves I make
And all of this herky-jerky motion and the bag of tricks it takes
To get me through my working day
One-trick pony
