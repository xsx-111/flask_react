Ace in the Hole LyricsSome people say Jesus that's the ace in the hole
But I never met the man so I don't really know
Maybe some Christmas if I'm sick and alone
He will look up my number, call me on the phone and I'll say

Hey, boy, where you been so long?
Don't you know me, I'm your ace in the hole
Two hundred dollars, that's my ace in the hole
When I'm down, dirty and desperate that's my emergency bank roll
I got two hundred dollars, that's the price on the street
If you wanna get some quality that's the price you got to meet
And the man says

Hey, junior, where you been so long?
Don't you know me, I'm your ace in the hole
Once I was crazy and my ace in the hole
Was that I knew that I was crazy so I never lost my self-control
I just walk in the middle of the road, I sleep in the middle of the bed
I stop in the middle of a sentence and the voice in the middle of my head said

Hey, junior, where you been so long?
Don't you know me, I'm your ace in the hole
Ace in the hole, lean on me
Don't you know me, I'm your guarantee
Riding on this rolling bus beneath a stormy sky
With a slow moon rising and the smokestacks drifting by
In the hour when the heart is weakest and the memory is strong
When time has stopped but the bus just rolls along
Roll on, roll on
Roll on, roll on
Roll on, roll on
Some people say music, that's their ace in the hole
Just your ordinary rhythm and blues, your basic rock and roll
You can sit on the top of the beat, you can lean on the side of the beat
You can hang from the bottom of the beat but you got to admit that the music is sweet
Where you been so long
Don't you know me, I'm your ace in the hole
Ace in the hole, lean on me
Don t you know me, I'm your guarantee
Some people say music, that's their ace in the hole
Just your ordinary rhythm and blues, your basic rock and roll
You can sit on the top of the beat, you can lean on the side of the beat
You can hang from the bottom of the beat but you got to admit that the music is sweet
Hey, junior, I'm your ace in the holeEmbed
