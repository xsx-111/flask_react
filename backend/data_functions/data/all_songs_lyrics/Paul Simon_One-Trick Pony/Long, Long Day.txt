Long, Long Day Lyrics
It's been a long, long day
I got some run-down shoes
Ain't got no place to stay
But any old place will be okay
It's been a long, long day

Goodnight, goodnight

I sure been on this road
Done nearly fourteen years
Can't say my name's well-known
You don't see my face in Rolling Stone
But I sure been on this road

Goodnight, goodnight

Slow motion
Half a dollar bill
Jukebox in the corner
Shooting to kill
And it's been a...
It's been a long, long day
I sure could use a friend
Don't know what else to say
I hate to abuse an old clich√©
But it's been a long, long day
It's been a long, long dayEmbed
