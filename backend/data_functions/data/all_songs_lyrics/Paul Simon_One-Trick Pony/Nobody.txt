Nobody LyricsWho knows my secret broken bone?
Who feels my flesh when I am gone?
Who was a witness to the dream?
Who kissed my eyes and saw the scream lying there?
Nobody
Who is my reason to begin?
Who plows the earth, who breaks the skin?
Who took my two hands and made them four?
Who is my heart, who is my door?
Nobody

Nobody but you, girl
Nobody but you
Nobody in this whole wide world
Nobody
Who makes the bed that can't be made?
Who is my mirror, who's my blade?
When I am rising like a flood
Who feels the pounding in my blood?
Nobody
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody in this whole wide world
Nobody, girl
