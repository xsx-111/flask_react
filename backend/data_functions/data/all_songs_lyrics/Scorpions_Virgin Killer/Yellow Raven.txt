Yellow Raven LyricsThe yellow raven sipped the air
Of thunder and of rain
The yellow raven sipped the air
Gentle lies kissing the rain
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
Take me away to somewhere
Take me away from here!
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
Answer to my yearning
Take me away from here!
The firebird began to cry
When the music died away
The firebird began to cry
And smoke was slowly drifting by
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
Take me away to somewhere
Take me away from here!
Where do you go, fantastic dreambird?
Answer to my yearning
Take me away from hereEmbed
