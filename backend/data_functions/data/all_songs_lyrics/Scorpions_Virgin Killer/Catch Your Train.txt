Catch Your Train LyricsWake up man it's late but not too late
It's six o'clock like everyday!
Get your things run and forget the rain
Take powerpills don't miss your train!
And you'd like to be another
A different guy and a better lover
For your love, for your life check your way
And you like the Rock'n'Roller
A different life and Whisky Cola
But don't be low keep your own style
And catch your train!
Don't be lazy man and work off your ass
He's the boss you've gotta do what he says!
Catch your train, run and forget those ways
Keep it cool it's not too late!
And you'd like to be another
A different guy and a better lover
For your love, for your life check your way
And you like the Rock'n'Roller
A different life and Whisky Cola
But don't be low keep your own style
And catch your train!Embed
