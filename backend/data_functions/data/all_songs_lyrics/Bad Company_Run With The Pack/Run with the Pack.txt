Run with the Pack LyricsYou never give me my money
You only give me your sympathy
'Cause I keep on running
There's no way to catch up with me
I'm leaving you, don't make no fuss;
You won't even see me, oh no, for dust
I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Never looking back
You try to keep me in cages
But baby, you got to catch me first
You think your law is contagious
I'll do my best, you can do your worst
I'm leaving you, now who can I trust;
You won't even see me, oh no, for dust
I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Never looking back
All right
Look out there
I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Never looking back
Running with the pack
I'm running with the pack
Running with the pack
Never looking back
Oh, yeah
You can't hold me down
You can't hold me back
On my own way
Running with the pack, ooh
Never, never, never looking back, Oh
Keep on running, keep on running
Yeah, yeah
Moving on, moving out
Oh, oh......Embed
