Silver, Blue & Gold LyricsIn the beginning, I believed every word that you said
Now that you're gone my world is in shreds
Oh, you loved me and left me
You took all the things that I needed so bad
I'm standing here wondering where is the love that I had?
Oh, give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
In the beginning, yeah
There was something of love that was mine
Now that it's gone, whoa, I'm cryin'
Oh, the time that it takes for a love
To grow cold is a wonder to me
I'm walkin' around with my head
Hangin' down, tell me where is she?
Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
Don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
Give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue
Now, give me silver, blue and gold
The colour of the sky I'm told
My ray-ay-ain-bow is overdue, yeah
Oh, don't forsake me 'cause I love you
Don't forsake me 'cause I love you, yeahEmbed
