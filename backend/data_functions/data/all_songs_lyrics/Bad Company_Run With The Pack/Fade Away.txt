Fade Away LyricsFading colours, changing sounds
Shades of night come tumbling down
Will tomorrow like yesterday
Fade away
Oh I am, a wayward man
Following a light to a distant land
Come tomorrow, hey yesterday
Fade away
High adventure I've just begun
Fame and fortune got me on the run
Break of day
Fade away, yeah
Oh yes I am a wayward man
Following the light to a distant land
Will tomorrow like yesterday
Fade away
Oh fade away, fade awayEmbed
