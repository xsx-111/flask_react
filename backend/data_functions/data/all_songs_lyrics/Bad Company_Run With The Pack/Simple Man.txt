Simple Man LyricsI am just a simple man, working on the land
Oh it ain't easy
I am just a simple man, working with my hands
Oh believe me
Freedom is the only thing means a damn to me
Oh you can't fake it
Freedom is the only song, sings a song for me
Oh we're gonna make it
I am just a simple man, trying to be me
Oh it ain't easy
I am just a simple man, trying to be free
Oh believe me
Freedom is the only thing means a damn to me
Oh you can't fake it
Freedom is the only song, sings a song for me
Oh we're gonna make it
I am just a simple man, working on the land
Oh it ain't easy
I'm just a simple man, working with my hands
Oh baby, believe me
I'm just a simple man, yeah yeah
Freedom is the only thing means a damn to me
I'm just a simple man, yeahEmbed
