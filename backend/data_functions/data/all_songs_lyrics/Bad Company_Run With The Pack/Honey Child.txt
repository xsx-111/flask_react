Honey Child LyricsWell, the first time that I met you, You were only seventeen
But I had to put you down, 'Cause I didn't know where you'd been
You had a long black dress, Your hair in a mess
You didn't seem to have no class, But the look on
Your face was no disgrace, I knew I had to move real fast
Honey Child, Don't you know you drive me wild! Oh, Honey Child
Don't you know you drive me wild! Just about to lose my mind
Well the second time that I met you, You were just turned
Twenty-one, An' all your talk about love, Love was gone, long gone
Oh, Honey Child, Don't you know you drive me wild! Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild! Just about to lose my mind
Yeah, yeah
Oh, honey child, Don't you know you drive me wild, mm
Honey child, Don't you know you drive me wild. Honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild. Oh, yeah, honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild. Oh, oh, honey child
Don't you know you drive me wild. Honey child, now
Don't you know you drive me wild, Yeah, yeah
Honey, honey, honey, honey child, Don't you know you drive me wild2Embed
