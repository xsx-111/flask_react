Love Me Somebody LyricsLove me somebody, somebody love me
Take me for what I'm worth
But only love me, but only love me
Well there was a crazy fool
Who followed you home from school
Hoping you would say "Hello"
But you didn't know
That you were breaking my heart
Love me somebody, somebody love me
Take me for what I'm worth
But only love me, but only love me
Well I was the crazy fool
Who followed you home from school
I was hoping that you would know
But you had to go
Breaking my heart, yeah
Love me somebody, somebody love me
Take me for what I'm worth
But only love me, but only love me
But only love me, but only love me
But only love me, but only love meEmbed
