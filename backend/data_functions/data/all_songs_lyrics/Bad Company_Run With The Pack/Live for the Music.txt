Live for the Music LyricsSome people say I'm no good
Laying in my bed all day
But when the night times comes I'm ready to rock
And roll my troubles away
I don't care if the sun don't shine
I know I'm gonna see it through
I don't care what nobody says
I'm tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna live for the music
Give it everything you got
Live for the music you know you're gonna find a lot
To ease your mind
Now you may say I'm a mean mistreater
Say I never treat you right
But sooner or later I'm gonna get to ya, baby
I don't wanna fuss and fight
Hey baby gimme good lovin'
Do it to me all night long
Any old thing gonna make me happy
Long as I can sing my song
I'm gonna live for the music
Give it everything you got
Live for the music you know you're gonna find a lot
To ease your mindEmbed
