Trains to Brazil LyricsIt's 1 o'clock on a Friday morning
I'm trying to keep my back from the wall
The prophets and their bombs have had another success
I'm wondering why we bother at all
And I think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
They remind me of when we were in school
Nothing really mattered when you called out my name
In fact, nothing really mattered at all
And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away
But I won't get me down
I'm just thankful to be facing the day
Cause days don't get you far when you're gone
It's 5 o' clock on a Friday morning
One hundred telephones shake and ring
One of them's from someone who knew you
Well I'll still think of you on cold winter mornings, darling
They'll still remind me of when we were at school
When they could never have persuaded me that lives like yours Were in the hands of these erroneous fools
And to those of you who moan your lives through one day to the next
Well, let them take you to next
Can't you live and be thankful you're here?
See it could be you tomorrow next year3Embed
