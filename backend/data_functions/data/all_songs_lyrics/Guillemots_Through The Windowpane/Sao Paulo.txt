Sao Paulo LyricsSit down my love of all good spaces
And breathe my love let's all be spent
I'm going to tell you both a story
About some memories that i dreamt
See i've lost love in many places
Not least the streets of san paolo
And friends especially, i didn't make them
A ten floor window to her home
Sometimes i could cry for miles
Sometimes i could cry for miles
Sometimes i could cry for miles
But i don't
So hush the shadows in the oak tree
Be still you curl upon the moor
My heart has fallen by the wayside
I cannot claim her anymore
So don your duffel coats quite slowly
And this sad jury has ajurned
While on the streets of old san paolo
I watch my baby being burned
Sometimes i could cry for miles
Sometimes i could cry for miles
Sometimes i could cry for miles
But i don't
Sometimes i could cry ah sometimes
Drop my bags and run for miles
And sometimes i could live my life
But i won't, but i won't
Have you ever been thrown across the water
Have you ever been thrown across the water
Have you ever been thrown across the water
Till there's no skin left on your bones
Thrown across water
Thrown across water
Thrown across water
Like a stone
Get me a doctor
Get me a doctor
Who will get rid of my bones
Get me a lover
Get me a lover
Who will leave my head alone
Get me a soldier
Get me a soldier
Who will fight me in this war
Get me an exit
I need an exit
I need a window or door
Thrown across water
Thrown across water
Thrown across water
Like a stone
Get me a lawyer
Get me a lawyer
Who will sue the world for me
Get me a person
Get me a person
Get me a person
Who isn't me
Cuz i'm getting tired
I'm getting tired
Of my stupid little face
Cuz i don't belong here
I don't belong here
Don't belong in this horse race
Thrown across water
Thrown across water
Thrown across water
Like a stone2Embed
