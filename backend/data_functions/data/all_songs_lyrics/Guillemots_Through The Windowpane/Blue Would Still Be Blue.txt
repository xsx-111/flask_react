Blue Would Still Be Blue Lyrics
It's not raining cats
It's not raining dogs
And pigs are not flying
Or turning the cogs
The sun has no hat on
Whenever it shines
And I've never seen a cat with nine lives
I'm not in a film
I'm not in a play
I saw no aliens today
I just saw you
And thought of me

And if I had you
All the stars wouldn't fall from the sky
And the moon wouldn't start to cry
There'd be no earthquakes
I'd still make mistakes
If I had you
Oh there'd still be day and night
And I'd still do wrong and right
Ooh
Blue would still be blue
But things would be easier with you
And this is no palace
The place that I live
And I am no king
But I've got things to give
And I waste so much time
Thinking of time
And I should be out there
Claiming what's mine
Any day I could die
Just like I was born
And this bit in the middle is what I'm here for
And I just want to fill it all with joy

And if I had you
All the stars wouldn't fall from the sky
And the moon wouldn't start to cry
There'd be no earthquakes
I'd still make mistakes
If I had you
Oh there'd still be night and day, a
Nd we'd all still have to pay
Ooh
Blue would still be blue
But things would just be easier with you1Embed
