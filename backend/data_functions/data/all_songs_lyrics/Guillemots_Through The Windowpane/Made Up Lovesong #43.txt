Made Up Lovesong #43 Lyrics
I love you through sparks and shining dragons, I do
And now there's poetry
In an empty coke can
I love you through sparks and shining dragons, I do
Now there's majesty
In a burnt out caravan

You got me off the paper round
Just sprang out of the air
The best things come from nowhere
I love you, I don't think you care

I love you through sparks and shining dragons, I do
And the symmetry
In your northern grin
I love you through sparks and shining dragons, I do
I can see myself
In the refilled litter bin

You got me off the sofa
Just sprang out of the air
The best things come from nowhere
I can't believe you care
Care
Na, na na, na na, na na, na, na
Da, na na, na na, na na, na na na
I love you, I love you
And I need you

Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe you
Yes, I believe youEmbed
