Through the Windowpane LyricsWoke up with a shoe in my mouth
Should I head north or head south?
You got me out on the lake
And I bank all my dreams on an earthquake
And I felt love
Come in through my windowpane
Tripping up the high road
Tearing down the low
And I saw life
Chanting out the mantra
If you want it, let it go
If you want it, sow
Words can't express what it means
And yes, I believe you Alice
And I felt love coming through my windowpane
Tripping up the high road
Tearing down the low
And I saw life chant
Shouting out the window
If you want it, let it go
If you want it, say so...
Oh, come in through my windowpane
Come in through my windowpane
Won't you come in through my windowpane
Come in through, come in through, ohEmbed
