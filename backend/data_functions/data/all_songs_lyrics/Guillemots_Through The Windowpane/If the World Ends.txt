If the World Ends LyricsI just about managed to forget you when you appear in a dream
And you're even more beautiful there than I remember you being
So I've come to decide that fate is telling me you will not go
And considering this I want you to know
If the world ends, I hope you're here with me
I think we could laugh just enough to not die in pain
If the world ends, it won't finish you
You're not the type they can capture, you flit like a fly catcher
They can't pin you down, can't pin you down
In my dream you're playing with buckets of sand
And water was running through both of your hands
And I don't think I ever heard you speaking
'Cause I was too wrapped up in the dream I was dreaming
So if the world ends, I hope you're by my side
I don't think with you here it will be too much pain
And when you cry, darling, I wish you'd feel my love
Your heart is way beyond capture, flitting like a fly catcher
They can't pin you down, whoa, they can't pin you down, whoa
Can't pin you down
Can't pin you down
Can't pin you down1Embed
