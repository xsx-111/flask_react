Roll Over Beethoven Lyrics
I'm gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rockin' little record I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, gotta hear it again today

You know my temperature's rising, the jukebox is blowing a fuse
My heart's beatin' rhythm and my soul keeps a-singin' the blues
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

I got the rockin' pneumonia, I need a shot of rhythm and blues
I got the rockin' arthritis sittin' down at the rhythm reviews
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news, WAH!

Well, if you feel like you like it, go get your lover
Then you reel and rock it, roll it over
Then you move on up just a trifle further
Then reel and rock it, roll it over
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news, WAH!


Well, early in the morning I'm giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle-diddle, I will play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven, we're rockin' in two by two
You know she wiggles like a glow worm, spin like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner, ought to see them reel and rock
Long as she's got a dime, the music won't ever stop

Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven, and dig these rhythm and bluesEmbed
