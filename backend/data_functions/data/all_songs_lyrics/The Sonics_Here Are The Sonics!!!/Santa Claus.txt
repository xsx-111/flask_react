Santa Claus LyricsYeah, Santa Claus, where have you been?
I've been waiting here just to let you in
Yeah, Santa Claus, what you got on your back?
Is there something for me inside that sack?
I want a brand new car, a twangy guitar
A cute little honey and lots of money
Santa Claus, won't you tell me please?
Whatcha gonna put under my Christmas tree?
And he just said:
"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing."
Yeah, Santa Claus, I've been waiting oh so long
Now don't you, don't you do me wrong
I want a brand new car, a twangy guitar
A cute little honey and lots of money
Santa Claus, oh won't you tell me please?
Whatcha gonna put under my Christmas tree?
And he just said:
"Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing"
Ah no
Ah no, nothing for Christmas
Santa Claus, won't you tell me?Embed
