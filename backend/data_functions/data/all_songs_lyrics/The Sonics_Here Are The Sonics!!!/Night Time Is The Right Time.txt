Night Time Is The Right Time LyricsHerman
You know the night time is the right time
For to be with the one you love
I said the night time is the right time
For to be with the one you love
I said the night time is the right time
For to be with the one you love
Baby X4
Please me X4
Say, the night time is the right time
For to be with the one you love
-GUITAR SOLO-
Baby X4
Please me X4
You know the night time is the right time
For to be with the one you loveEmbed
