Have Love, Will Travel LyricsWow, Have love
Whoa baby will travel
Uh huh, uh huh, have love
Woah baby will travel
I said if you need loving then
Mm, hmm, I'll travel
Yeah, I'll travel from Maine to Mexico
Just to find a little girl that loves me so
No matter when, no matter where I'll be
I'm looking for a woman that'll satisfy me
Wow, Have love
Whoa baby will travel
Uh huh, uh huh, have love
Woah baby will travel
I said if you need loving then
Mm, hmm, I'll travel

Yeah, yeah, yeah, have love
Oh baby will travel
Uh huh, have love
Oh pretty baby will travel
I said if you need loving then
Mm, I'll travel
Well I might take a boat or I'll take a plane
I might hitch hike or jump a railroad train
Your kind of love drives a man insane
So look for me walking just a any old way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, have love
Oh baby will travel
Uh huh, have love
Oh pretty baby will travel
I said if you need loving then
Mm, I'll travelEmbed
