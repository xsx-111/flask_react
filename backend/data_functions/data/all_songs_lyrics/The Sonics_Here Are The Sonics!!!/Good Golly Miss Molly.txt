Good Golly Miss Molly LyricsBlackwell-Marascalco
Good Golly Miss Molly, you sure have to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly, you sure have to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call
From the early early mornin' till the early early night
You can see Miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue light
Good Golly Miss Molly, you sure have to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call
Momma, pappa told me - Son, you better watch your step
For you have to marry Molly just as sure as you can bet
Good Golly Miss Molly, you sure have to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call
-PIANO SOLO-
Well, I'm gone to the store, I'm gonna buy a diamond ring
She hugged me and she kissed me made me ting-a-ling-a-ling
Good Golly Miss Molly, you sure have to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma call
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rockin' and a rollin' can't hear your momma callEmbed
