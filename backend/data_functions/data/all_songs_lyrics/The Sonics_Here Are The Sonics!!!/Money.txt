Money LyricsBradford-Gordy
You know the best things in life are free
But you can give them to the birds and bees
I need money, that's what I want. Oh yeah, yeah
That's what I-------that's what I want
Oh, lots of things are gonna cure your ills
But only one thing's gonna pay my bills
And that's money, yeah, yeah, that's what I want
Uh-huh-------that's what I want
WOW!
-Solo-
Money isn't everything, it's true
But what it can't buy, I'll never use
I need money. Yeah, yeah
That's what I want
Stomp, Shout, work it on out yeah----------
That's what I want
WOW!
Give me money, that's what I want x3
That's what I----------
That's what I want. WOW!Embed
