Boss Hoss LyricsJust bought myself a new set of wheels
My folks helped me swing the deal
Believe me buddy I'm no fool
I got the money working after school
It's the movin'est car and I've never lost, 'cause
It's a real boss hoss
Real boss hoss
It's painted a turn-on red
Girls see it and it knocks 'em dead
I get around just everywhere
People stop and say lookie there
I get all the honeys and I've never lost, cause
It's a real boss hoss
Real boss hoss
It really moves and
Everybody knows it
It has never lost
Oh yeah oh yeah
'Cause it's a real boss hoss
SAX SOLO
It really moves and
Everybody loses
It has never lost
'Cause oh, oh oh
Waooh it's a real boss hoss
Everybody is jealous at me
One look and you can see
With this car I just can't lose
Don't you ever try to choose
It's the movin'est car and I've never lost 'cause
It's a real boss hoss
Real boss hoss
It's a real boss hoss real boss hoss Real boss hossEmbed
