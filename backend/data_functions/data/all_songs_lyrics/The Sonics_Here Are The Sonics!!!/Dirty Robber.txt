Dirty Robber Lyrics
Well, I had a little girl
She was so mean to me
Told her off now
Yes indeed
Said

Your dirty robber
Your dirty robber
Well, you've taken my love
Then you run away

Well, I went to her house
I gonna take her to a show
Find her there
With someone high class Joe

Your dirty robber
Your dirty robber
Well, you've taken my love
Then you run away

This little girl
She was so mean to me
Told her off now
Yes indeed
Said

Your dirty robber
Your dirty robber
Well, you've taken my love
Then you run away


You've taken my money
You've taken my car
Little girl, you even took my guitar
Said

Your dirty robber
Your dirty robber
Well, you've taken my love Then you run awayEmbed
