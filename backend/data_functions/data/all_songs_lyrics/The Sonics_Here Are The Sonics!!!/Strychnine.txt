Strychnine LyricsSome folks like water
Some folks like wine
But I like the taste
Of straight strychnine (hey, hey)
You may think it's funny
That I like this stuff
But once you've tried it
You can't get enough (wow!)
Wine is red
Poison is blue
Strychnine is good
For what's ailin' you (wow!)
Wine is red
Poison is blue
Strychnine is good
For what's ailin' you (wow!)
If you listen to what I say
You'll try strychnine some day
Make you jump, it'll make you shout
It'll even knock you out
Some folks like water
Some folks like wine
But I like the taste
Of straight strychnine (wow!)
Strychnine hey, hey
Strychnine hey, hey (wow!)
Strychnine hey, hey
Strychnine hey, hey
Strychnine hey, hey
Strychnine hey, heyEmbed
