Psycho Lyrics
Ready?
Ow! Baby, you're driving me crazy
I said baby, you're driving me crazy
The way you turn me on
Then you shot me down
Ah well, tell me baby
Am I just your clown?
Psycho!
Ow!
Ow! Baby, you're driving me crazy
I said I'm losing my mind
You treat me so unkind
Psycho!
Ow!

Woooow!!
Ow!
Wow! Baby, you're driving me crazy
I'm going out of my head
And now I wish I was dead
Psycho!
Wow, baby, whoa, you're driving me crazy
I'm going out of my head
Now I wish I was dead
Woow Psycho!!
Woooow Psycho!!
Wooow Psycho!!
Wooooooooww!  Psycho!!
Wooooooooooww!!
Wooooooooooooooooooowwww!
Wooooooooooooooww!
