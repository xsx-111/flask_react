Do You Love Me ? LyricsWell do you love me (I can really move)
Well do you love me (I'm in the groove)
Ah do you love me (do you love me)
Now that I can dance
Watch me now, oh
(work it all) I said-a work it all baby
(work it all) ah, you're drivin' me crazy
(work it all) a-with a little bit of soul now
Mmm, now I can do the blues (do the blues)
And I can do the twist (do the twist)
I said now tell me baby (tell me baby)
Mmm, now do you like it like this (like it like this)
Whoa, tell me, tell me, tell me
Ah, do you love me (I can really move)
Well do you love me (I'm in the groove)
Well do you love me (do you love me)
Now that I can dance
Watch me now, oh
(work it all) I said-a work it all baby
(work it all) mmm, you're drivin' me crazy
(work it all) a-with a little bit of soul now
Now I can do the blues (do the blues)
Mmm, I can do the twist (do the twist)
I said now tell me baby (tell me baby)
Ah, do you like it like this (like it like this)
Whoa, tell me, tell me, tell me
Ah, well do you love me (I can really move)
Well do you love me (I'm in the groove)
Well do you love me (do you love me)
Now that I can dance
