Possessive Lyrics
I'm a man and I'm so possessive
And I don't know if I'm keeping my mouth shut yet
Got advice, don't know what it was good for
Even now I don't know who I'm supposed to hate
Come to grips with the rules of attraction
And I don't know If you've ever liked me or not
Either way it was kind of convincing
You never learn, do you?

You cold headed but you worry alone
You could get in trouble but they already know
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, ah oh
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, ah oh

You sat out and your covered in darkness
Is it always easier after hours
We're you always pulling a fast one
Was he always keeping you on your toes
I don't mean to sound melodramatic
But I don't know and I'm disconnected from you
You could do with a little excitement
There's nothing else to do
Oh, you so wicked with a mania for
You are working in the cover but you worry alone
You could get in trouble but they already know
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, ah oh
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, ah oh
Aaaaaaah oooooooh

Immorality's a thrill
Even let it get the best of me
But you've been messing around and your so composed
But ya get what you want, and you want one of those
But you might do what I told you if you knew what I was thinking
And yeah ya might do what I told you if you knew what I was thinking
Yeah ya might do what I told you if you knew what I was thinking
Yeah ya might do what I told you if you knew what I was thinking

Oh, you so wicked with a mania for
You are working in the cover but you worry alone
You could get in trouble but they already know
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, ah oh
Ah oh, ah oh, ah oh, ah oh
Aaaaaaah ooohEmbed
