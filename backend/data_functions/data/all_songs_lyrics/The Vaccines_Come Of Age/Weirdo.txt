Weirdo Lyrics
I know I'm fucking moody
And I know I'm quite unkind
I know I'm kinda distant
But you're always on my mind
And you imply that I am apathetic
Right to the bone

And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo

I guess I'm quite controlling
And I'm insecure
And I know you'd like it better
If I opened up some more
But I don't even know if I could look you
Straight in the eye
Oh my

And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo
And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo

I know that I'm neurotic
And I'm hard to please
And I'm disobliging
And faulty by design
Not withstanding
I think we could work out just fine

And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
You question me even though
You know i'm not a weirdo
And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo, no
And I don't wanna let it go
You know I'm not a weirdo6Embed
