Lonely World Lyrics
I knew who you were, it was perfectly obvious
I was uncomfortable playing it cool
But I feel like I have always known you
I kept you close and I thought you would question it
Young in the night, when we stare like the rest of them
God forbid
Oh my God

I would hold you close
Cause it is a lonely world
But would you want me too
Cause it is a lonely world

Well I put off cause I'm painfully diffident
I played it out in my head from afar
But then trust me to go miss my moment
You disappeared to my dissatisfaction
Oh, what could have been with a little more time?
Woe is me
Oh my God

I would hold you close
Cause it is a lonely world
But would you want me too
Cause it is a lonely world
Yeah I would hold you close
Cause it is a lonely world
If I was confident
Cause it is a lonely world
Yeah I would hold you close
Cause it is a lonely world
But would you want me too
Cause it is a lonely world
Yeah I would hold you close
Cause it is a lonely world
If I was confident
Cause it is a lonely world1Embed
