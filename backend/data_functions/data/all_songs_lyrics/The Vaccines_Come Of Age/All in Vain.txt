All in Vain LyricsOh, you can't hold a gun to my head
No, you can't hold a gun to my head
Because baby, I would just refuse
Baby, I would just refuse
All in vain, all in vain
Well you don't know how I feel and I can't explain
Oh, you can't hold a gun to my head
No, you can't hold a gun to my head
Because baby, I would just refuse
Baby, I would just refuse
All in vain, all in vain
When I follow anything that takes my life
All in vain, all in vain
When I self-destruct for fun and I don't know why
You might as well admit it, despite how you may see it
I'm never gonna waste my time with you
I don't know how you're feeling, you know you kinda blew it
I'm never gonna waste my time with you
Oh, you can't hold a gun to my head
No, you can't hold a gun to my head
Because baby, I would just refuse
Baby, I would just refuse
All in vain, all in vain
When I ate an appetite that I can't refuse
All in vain, all in vain
Having been there, I would never go again1Embed
