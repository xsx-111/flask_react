Ghost Town LyricsI've been driving in my car
Trying to find some sign of life
No one's about and it's kinda creepy
It's an understatement to say it's sleepy
It's a ghost town where no one goes
It's a ghost town where no one goes
Well you think your town is pretty boring
Come and spend a day with me
I am asking real politely
I'm afraid to be alone
It's a ghost town where no one goes
It's a ghost town where no one goes
Apocalyptic, distressing, needs addressing and I'm guessing
Everybody likes to go... I know, I know, I know
It's a ghost town where no one goes
It's a ghost town where no one goes
It's a ghost town
