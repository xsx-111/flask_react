I Wish I Was a Girl Lyrics
You walk into the room with refining and poise
Bewitching, enthralling all of the boys
You're so chic and you're so sweet
And oh

I wish I was a girl
Yeah, I wish I was a girl

You seductive mystery
You're a revelation to me
Life is easy when you're easy on the eye
And I

I wish I was a girl
Yeah, I wish I was a girl

Cause your appeal's an open door
That you float through in your haute couture
Dolce & Gabbana, McQueen, Armani, Prada
Von Furstenberg on Mulberry, Givenchy and Escada
Oh, I wish I was a girl
Yeah, I wish I was a girl
Oh, I wish I was a girl
Yeah, I wish I was a girl
I wish I was a girl
Yeah, I wish I was a girl2Embed
