No Hope Lyrics
Oh I could bore you with the truth
About an uneventful youth
Or you could get that rap from someone else
And I could make an observation
If you want the voice of a generation
But I’m too self absorbed to give it clout

And I, I don’t really care about
Anybody else when I haven’t got my own life figured out
Cause when you’re young and bored and 24
And don’t know who you are no more

There's no hope
And it’s hard to come of age
I think it’s a problem
Does it ever go away?
I know, I am so self-obsessed
I guess, but there’s no hope
And I hope it’s just a phase
I’ll outgrow-oh-oh-oh

Oh I could look for inspiration
Find it in the charm of an english nation
But wouldn’t that be cheap and ill-informed
And I could bet you don’t believe me
If I said it came from deep within me
But I promise you I’m telling you the truth
And I, I don’t really care about
Anybody else when I haven’t got my own life figured out
Cause when you’re 24 and young and bored
And don’t know who you are no more

There's no hope
And it’s hard to come of age
I think it’s a problem
Does it ever go away?
I know, I am so self-obsessed
I guess, but there’s no hope
And I hope it’s just a phase
I’ll outgrow-oh-oh-oh

Well I wish that I was comfortable in my own skin
But the whole thing feels like an exercise
In trying to be someone I would rather not be
I tried to second guess if you would be approving
I find my life ever so moving
Keen, wide-eyed, and unassuming, hope
There is no hope, but there’s desperately
No hope and there’s definitely
No hope if you don’t believe me
Oh
And there is no hope and there’s desperately
No hope, and there’s definitely
No hope if you don’t believe me
Oh
And I, I don’t really care about
Anybody else when I haven’t got my own life figured out
Cause when you’re 24 and young and bored
And don’t know who you are no more

There's no hope
And it’s hard to come of age
I think it’s a problem
Does it ever go away?
I know, I am so self-obsessed
I guess, but there’s no hope
And I hope it’s just a phase
I’ll outgrow
There is no hope
I know it’s a problem
And it never goes my way
I know, I am so self-obsessed
I guess, but there’s no hope
And I hope it’s just a phase
I’ll outgrow, oh, oh, oh4Embed
