Teenage Icon Lyrics
Oh look at me, so ordinary
No mystery with no great capabilities, but
I could make out as if I had it, but you know
God I'm so obvious and I should let it go
Oh, I don't know, ooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero

Reserved and shy, your average guy
No piercing stare, just out of shape with messy hair but
I always figured I was somebody and wait
And now I'm guessing that my moment must be late
'Cause I'm here, ooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero

I'm not magnetic or mythical
I'm suburban and typical
But I got it, I got it
I'm overrun with it all

Seductive charm, a way with words
So effortless not leather clad or dangerous, but
I always did it like a real rebel would
I have a photo where John Lennon may have stood
Or so I'm told, ooh

I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero


I'm no teenage icon
I'm no Frankie Avalon
I'm nobody's hero6Embed
