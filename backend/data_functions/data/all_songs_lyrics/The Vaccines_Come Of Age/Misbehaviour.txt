Misbehaviour LyricsReality bites the palm of your hand
And it cuts you down to size
Don't wanna settle down
I wanna have some fun
And I wanna indulge
Before it's too late
I want no regrets
I've done nothing yet
And any dream I have I just forget
And oh you are so defiant
And I'm not try'na change ya
I'm just looking for some bad behaviour
Oh bad behaviour
I don't wanna get old
I wanna do what I want
They're all playing it safe
You know just how you are
I try so hard
And it's never enough
Is it ever enough
Do you think?
Cos life's so tame
And it's so mundane
And it's so
Oh I don't know
And oh you are so defiant
And I'm not try'na change ya
I'm just looking for some bad behaviour
Oh bad behaviour
And if I told you
I felt excitable
If I told you
I go with the flow
If I told you
I'm uncontrollable I know
No matter what I do
You'll see straight through
Cos you're too
Much like me
Ok
And oh you are so defiant
And I'm not try'na change ya
I'm just looking for some bad behaviour
Oh bad behaviour
And oh you are so defiant
And I'm not try'na change ya
I'm just looking for some bad behaviour
Oh bad behaviour
