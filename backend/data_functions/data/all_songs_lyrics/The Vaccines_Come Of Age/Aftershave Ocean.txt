Aftershave Ocean LyricsYou have been struggling to see actuality
Actually, it doesn't surprise me
And you wearing wof frozen to the core
I'm not wearing anything awful
But you are pulling the wool over, wouldn't you rather know
That I am overindulging you, it's so easy though
You're coming up for air
Happier down there
In your aftershave ocean
Lies, difficult to face
Floating out in space
In your aftershave ocean
I could be talking out of line, you could put me straight
And I'd say I don't understand you
You'd say "Oh, ignorance is bliss, come give me a kiss
Come give me a piece of your mind"
Cause you are pulling the wool over, wouldn't you rather know
That I am overindulging you, it's so easy though
You're coming up for air
Happier down there
In your aftershave ocean
Lies, difficult to face
Floating out in space
In your aftershave ocean
Oh you are pulling the wool over, wouldn't you rather know
That I am overindulging you, it's so easy though
You're coming up for air
Happier down there
In your aftershave ocean
I get water up my nose
I have to dry my clothes
In your aftershave ocean
Lies, difficult to face
Floating out in space
In your aftershave ocean
You're coming up for air
Happier down there
In your aftershave ocean2Embed
