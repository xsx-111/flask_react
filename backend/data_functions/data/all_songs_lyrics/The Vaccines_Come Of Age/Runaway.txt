Runaway LyricsIs this not an inquisition baby
You're not the first I've told
That I'm gonna wake up lonely someday
And I'm gonna wake up old
It took me higher and higher and higher
But then that was a while ago
And I've got a restless feeling baby
So I think it's best you know
Oh I could've done the righteous thing
But we're all gonna die someday
I'm not gonna look you in the eye
And tell you it's all okay
Runaway
It's okay
Runaway
It's okay
Now I got a new position
And it's difficult to address
There ain't no easy way of saying
But I'm getting it off my chest
It took me higher and higher and higher
So I'm sorry to be so low
But I've got a restless feeling baby
That I think it's best to go
Oh I could've done the righteous thing
But we're all gonna die someday
And maybe I lack discretion darling
But I don't know what to say
Runaway
It's okay
Runaway
It's okay
Oh I could've broke your heart I guess
But, what else could I have done?
But I'm looking after number 1 now
Maybe I've got to
Maybe I've got to
Maybe I've got to learn
Runaway
It's okay
Runaway
It's okay
Runaway
It's okay
Runaway
It's okay1Embed
