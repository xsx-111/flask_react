Track Six Lyrics
Say it got late on that one
That life-giver one
Hanging weightless from the wound
In a half-light

Taken up I could hold him
When all falls away
Prayed into each other
You stood in the air

And the ceilings are rising and falling
The ceilings are shining and slow
Peeling tongues from the ice hums
And letting it go
And the ceilings are rising and falling
The ceilings are shining and slow
Peeling tongues from the ice hums
And letting it goEmbed
