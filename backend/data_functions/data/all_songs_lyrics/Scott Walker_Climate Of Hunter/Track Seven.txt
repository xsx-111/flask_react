Track Seven Lyrics
Stump of a drowner
The delta holder
Lowered up from his boulder
And riding pains steady blowout
All those arms in the gullys
Chewed through at the wrists
All that won't flood awake –
– all that listens and lifts

Deserting your lead
While the figure is also carrying
Deserting your lead
While the figure is also carrying
Your hands are drained
Your skins are stained and heavy
Go to ground
You are sealed against the night

Spotted head blood head
Heat up the stars
Polish and silence away your parole
She's a dugout; her second sleeps
Dragging the roads
Her fixed strays shine from ditches
Wherever she goes
Deserting your lead
While the figure is also carrying
Pry open those jaws
Try and hear your own way out
Driven in deep;
You save yourself the burying
The darkness swarms;
Try and hear your own way outEmbed
