Dealer Lyrics
The windows are ringing, shaking night-nites for angels
Rattling throats up and down on a beam
Cooling the hearts, cooling the plasma
Keeping ice junkies packed hard on a seam
The other side of a prowler, the dead still search the living
At least there we did not not fail
Coming to in the overcast, tracks are still flowing
At least there he does not wail

Psalms of your hands sung into the lateness
Move a circuit on the white and he can't feel a thing
Gone always alone to all you are never
He climbs into your mouth when the windows ring

The windows are ringing, shaking dead men for angels
Hissing brains boiling up press't to the bone
Uncoils the wire whole night long
Bumping out thru the eye in knots
Sweet hot numbers, sweet hots
Bumping out thru' the eye on a wire of knots
Sweet hot numbers, sweet hots
Bumping out thru' the eye on a wire of knots
Psalms of your hands sung into the lateness
Move a circuit on the white and he can't feel a thing
Gone always alone to all you are never
He climbs into your mouth when the windows ringEmbed
