Sleepwalkers Woman Lyrics
In the time of an exile
From the jails of another
Where soundings are taken
Raw to his eyes
I have walked the way from him
Down to splintering bone ashes
With your voice shining sea
In his fractures and skies

There are no voices here
There are only confessions
Keeping him hidden
Weighed out of his name
We have entered deserted
He has gazed from my windows
As if all that replaced us
Could still end in me

For the first time unwoken
I am returned
For the first time unwoken
I am returned
He arrives from a place
With a face of fast sun
Arrives from a space
His refuge overrun
She will fold him away in his
Badly changed hand
Fold him away
Far behind where I am

For the first time forgetting
I am returned
Her mind moved by the silence
I am returned
As if all that replaced us
Ends it again
As if all that replaced us
EndsEmbed
