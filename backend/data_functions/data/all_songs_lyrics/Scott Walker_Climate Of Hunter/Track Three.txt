Track Three Lyrics
Delayed in the headlong
Resembled to breaking-point
I swear you never slept at night
When the growing is slow
After me, I'm no man's son
Run out of recognise
The blood of our split back without his prisoner
The distance rigged in his eyes

Rock of cast-offs, bury me
Hide my soul and sink us free
Rock of cast offs, bury me
Hide my soul and pray us free

From the host of late-comers
A miracle enters the streets
Shining with rain
He is shaking to wash the murder away
The shadow of the son made the son a shadow
It's never night when I die
That desert clouds under and so Lord lightens
Sleepers wait there with wounds in their sides

In the strength of the crime
You sing like a stranger
And your failure fulfills
Your most secret defeat
After me I'm no man's son
Run out of recognise
A life of it's own lays down the horizon
The distance rigged in it's eyes

Rock of cast-offs, bury me
Hide my soul and sink us free
Rock of cast offs, bury me
Hide my soul and pray us freeEmbed
