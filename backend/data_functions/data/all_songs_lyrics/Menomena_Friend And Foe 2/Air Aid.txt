Air Aid LyricsPeople of the future will remember
Her fate is something she brought upon herself
Writes a suicide note into the movie
"I love you all too much to carry on"
Everyone will think back to what they were wearing
Or who they were dating when the bones were found
People of the future won't remember names
But their betrayal smells the same
Rain is falling through the floor
Rain is coming rain is coming
Rain is falling through the floor
Cover your ears, cover your eyes, cover your mouth
Silence, blindness, tasteless violence
Air aid
Bring me the kite tied to the key, covered in fire
Downpour, thunder laced with lightning
Air aid
People of the future
Take it back
(I can't understand most of this whole part)
Cover your ears, cover your eyes, cover your mouth
Silence, blindness tasteless violence
Air aid
Bring me the kite tied to the key, covered in fire
Downpour, thunder laced with lightning
Air aid
Brought upon herself
Cover your ears, cover your eyes, cover your mouth
Silence, blindness tasteless violence
Air aid
Cover your eyes
Brought upon herself
Cover your eyesEmbed
