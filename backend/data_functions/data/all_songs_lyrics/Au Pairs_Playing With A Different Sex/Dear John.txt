Dear John LyricsDear John, cherchez la femme?
Dear John, round the bend?
Dear John, still looking for me?
Dear John, still like what you see?
Dear John, find a sex-machine
It will help with your fantasy
But there's only room for one
And here she comes and here she goes
Dear John, find a sex-machine
It will help with your fantasy
But there's only room for one
And here she comes and here she goes
The car, is it kingfisher blue?
The house, do I welcome you?
Do I recline like the seats in your bed?
Sex-tech objects locked in your head?
(This is a letter to make you feel better) The car, is it kingfisher blue?
(This is a letter to make you feel better) The house, do I welcome you?
(This is a letter to make you feel better) Do I recline like the seats in your bed?
(This is a letter to make you feel better) Sex-tech objects locked in your head?
(This is a letter to make you feel better) The car, is it kingfisher blue?
(This is a letter to make you feel better) The house, do I welcome you?
(This is a letter to make you feel better) Do I recline like the seats in your bed?
(This is a letter to make you feel better) Sex-tech objects locked in your head?
This is a letter to make you feel better
This is a letter to make you feel better
This is a letter to make you feel better
This is a letter to make you feel better
Dear John, I'm waiting for you
In the restaurant, I've ordered for two
It's spread upon and around the tables
Ex-bed, horny fables
Dear John, find a sex-machine
It will help with your fantasy
But there's only room for one
And here she comes and here she goes
Dear JohnEmbed
