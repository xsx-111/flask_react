Unfinished Business LyricsI'm your unfinished business
I turn up at times, conveniently around
I don't make demands
It's on your terms but they're sound
Playing your game
I'm verging on the humane
I get a little romance
When I get the chance to
I'm the spasmodic amusement
No expense, I'm no obligation
I'm your erotic profit
A bonus from the rock and roll situation
'Cause I'm playing your game
I'm verging on the humane
I get a little romance
When I get the chance to, uh-huh
Yes, you ought to
Then you ought to
Yes, you ought to
Think about me
I'm, I'm your unfinished business
Lazy rendezvous for two
I'll put in an appearance
That's when the time is right for you
'Cause I'm running your game
I'm verging on the humane
I get a little romance
When I get the chance to, uh-ho
Yes, you ought to
Then you ought to
Yes, you ought to
Yes, you ought to
Then you ought to
Yes, you ought to
Think about meEmbed
