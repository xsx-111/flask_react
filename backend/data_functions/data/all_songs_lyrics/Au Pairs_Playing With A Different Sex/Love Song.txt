Love Song LyricsA touch a glance it's a slow dance
It's a classified romance
Purpose, lust and charm
Dance to an old refrain
(I love you, I love you)
Dance to an old refrain
I love you, I love you (I love you, I love you)
Mutual attachment
Semi detachment
Rinse out the dream (in the washing machine)
Rinse out the dream (in the washing machine)
Rinse out the dream (in the washing machine)
In the washing machine (in the washing machine)
In the washing machine (in the washing machine)
In the washing machine (machine)
Take out the ring, two fates sealed
Negotiated a business deal
Is this true romance?
Champagne bubbles (going flat)
Champagne bubbles (going flat)
Champagne bubbles (going flat)
Going flat (they're going flat)
Going flat (they're going flat)
Going flat (they're going flat)
Going... (gone flat)
Will you dine with me tonight?
Will you dance and hold me tight?
Send me an orchid on Valentine's day
What more need you to say?
Will you be my wife (be mine)
To honour and obey (be mine)
Drink some more white wine (be mine)
Think it over one day (be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine)
Touch glance (I love you)
It's a romance (I love you)
Touch glance (I love you)
It's a romance (I love you)
Touch glance (I love you)Embed
