Domestic Departure LyricsShit, I'm late
My  is burnt
The door is shut
No more 
(Shit, I'm late)
It's nearly 6 o'clock
I packed my green suitcase
(My  is burnt)
The one with the broken lock
I stuck it sellotape
(The door is shut)
Change it on Saturday
(No more )
Sorry I couldn't stop
I had to go away

[?}
It's nearly 6 o'clock
I packed my green suitcase
The one with the broken lock
I stuck it sellotape
Send it on Saturday
Sorry I couldn't stop
I had to go away
I had to go away
I had to go away
I had to go away
I had to go away
I had to go away
I had to go away
I had to goEmbed
