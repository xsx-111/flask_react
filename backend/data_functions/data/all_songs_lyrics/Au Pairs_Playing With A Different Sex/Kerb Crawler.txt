Kerb Crawler Lyrics
Mama always told me not to talk to strange men
If you don't, you'll be alright
Well I pray enough but 
And I still can't walk alone at night

Ah, he's outside late in the night
Hiding behind the blackest thunder
Picking up on every woman in sight
He's known as the 

He's outside in a silver machine
Just cruising along and living his dream
Hiding behind his window screen
Searching you out with his headlight beams

Ah, sometimes  send him away
But the fear, the fear is always there
Am I here hunting for 
But to him, we are one and the same

He's outside in a silver machine
Just cruising along and living his dream
Hiding behind his window screen
Searching you out with his headlight beams
He's outside in a silver machine
Just cruising along and living his dream
Hiding behind his window screen
Searching you out with his headlight beamsEmbed
