You Lyrics
Ah you, you're just another you
You're under fire
You, they know your past
Ah you, they know your scars

They know who was with you last night
They even knew what pattern you wear
They know about the scars under your leg
They know when you lie, dye your hair

Ah you, you're just another you
You're under fire
You, they know your past
Ah you, they know your scars

They'll try and make you into something bad
You don't have no rights at all
You are just a social mishap
You ain't a nice lady at all

Ah you, Ah you
Ah you, Ah you
Ah you, Ah you...

Ah you, they rang your telephone
You are just a social disease
You don't want, lеave you alone
They know you'vе had an emotion 

Ah you, Ah you
Ah you, Ah you

Ah you, you're just another you
You're under fire
You, they know your past
Ah you, they know your scars

Ah you, Ah you...Embed
