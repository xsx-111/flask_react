Repetition LyricsJunie is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you when you ask him how the kids are
He'll get home around 7
'Cause the car's real old
And he could have a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne in a blue silk blouse
Could have married Anne in a blue silk blouse
Could have married Anne in a blue silk blouse
And the food is on the table
But the food is cold (don't hit her)
Oh can't you even cook?
What's the good of him working if you can't damn cook?
Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through
It shows through (it shows through)
It shows through (it shows through)
It shows through (it shows through)
Could have married Anne in a blue silk blouse
Could have married Anne
Could have married Anne in a blue silk blouse
Could have married Anne in a blue silk blouse
Could have married Anne in a blue silk blouse
It shows through (it shows through)
It shows through (it shows through)
It shows through
Could have married Anne in a blue silk blouse
Could have married Anne
It shows through (it shows through)
It shows through (it shows through)
It shows through
It shows through
It shows through
It shows through
Could have married Anne in a blue silk blouseEmbed
