Headache for Michelle LyricsGot a bad taste in my mouth, I've got a
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy headache
Won't go away
I can't remember much about last night
But I'm trying to regain a little self-control
Today
I got out of my head
I got out of my head
I got out of my head
I got out...
Last night
They are coming
Amongst, amongst, amongst, amongst, amongst, amongst, amongst
And in-between us
They're tapping our phones
Tapping our phones
Tapping our phones
You can be sure that
They've seen us
Are you working
Are you working
Are you working
Are you working for
Or with the state
They're selling you smack at a
Slightly, slightly, slightly, slightly, slightly, slightly, slightly
Cheaper rate
'Cause you're not a threat when you're out of your head
And I'm gonna get out of my head
And it's better in bed
When you're out of your head
And Malcolm is dead
He got out of his head
Out of his head
They are closing down
Communications
They're taking control
Of our situations
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
The forces of control
Are gathering around our heads
'Round our heads
'Cause you're not a threat when you're out of your head
And I'm gonna get out of my head
And it's better in bed
When you're out of your head
And Malcolm is dead
He got out of his head
And I'm gonna get out of my head
And you're not a threat when you're out of your head
How can you get
How can you get
How can you get
How can you get
How can you get
Out of his head?
Out of his head
How can you get
Out of his head?
How can you get
Out of his head?
How can you get?
He got out of his head
Malcolm is dead
He got out of his head
You're not a threat when you're out of your head
Malcolm is dead
Malcolm is deadEmbed
