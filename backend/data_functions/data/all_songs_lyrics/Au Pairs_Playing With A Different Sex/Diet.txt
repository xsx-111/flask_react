Diet LyricsHe works the car
She the sink
She's not here
To think
Sits with the paper
Discuss the news
She doesn't have
Political views
Little one
Can't get to sleep
Mama my nightdress
It's hurting me
Falls on her knees
What has she done
I forgot the comfort
O little one
Press the button
On the tumble-drier
Nothing
Can send her higher
Than his shirts
Whiter than white
Gleaming
Ultrabright
Muddy floors
She cleans with flash
Scrub the bath
It doesn't scratch
Has a dance
With Mr. Sheen
See the sideboard
Sparkling clean
A woman's own diet
Keeps her figure trim
Has a headache
Takes anadin
There's a constant pain
Behind her eyes
She needs to be tranquillised
She needs to be tranquillised
She needs to be tranquillised
She needs to be tranquillised
She needs to be tranquillised
She needs to be tranquillised
He works the car
She the sink
She's not here
To think
Sits with the paper
Discuss the news
She doesn't have political views
She doesn't have political views
She doesn't have political views
She doesn't have any views
She doesn't have any views
She doesn't have any views
She doesn't have any views
She doesn't have any viewsEmbed
