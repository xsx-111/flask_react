Come Again LyricsYou're one of those
Who changed the game
You brought in new rules
Which you obey
And coping, coping, coping or nearly anyway
You mustn't do this
It may affect us
You must give more
Than you take away (take a, take a, take a, take a, take a)
Take away (take away)
But is it real?
Are you feeling it?
You behave like a model for others to follow
Are you feeling it?
Ah, equal shares, equal shares, ah
It's frustrating
Aggravating
So annoying
Pretend you're enjoying it
(Am I doing it right, doing it right)
(Am I doing it right, doing it right)
(Am I)
Oh, it's your turn now
But do you want to?
I don't know if you want to
It's inhibiting, restricting, so confusing, now I'm losing count
Can't concentrate, it's another way to take
Mustn't think about it
Free and at ease
You're not selfish
You're trying hard to please me
(Do ya, like it like this, like it this)
Please, please me
(Do ya, like it like this, like it this)
Is your finger aching?
I can feel you hesitating
Is your finger aching?
I can feel you hesitating
Is your finger aching?
Is your finger aching?
Yes, thank you, I got one
Yes, it was nice
Yes, we should go to sleep now
Yes, yes it was fine
(We must, we must, do it again, do it again sometime) We must, we must, do it again, do it again sometime
(Do it again, do it again sometime) We must, do it again sometime
(Do it again, do it again sometime) We must, do it again sometime
(Do it again, do it again sometime) We must
Would you like doing it again?
Well, OK
Not tonight, not tonight, I'm too tired
Come on
I've got to work tomorrow
Oh shit, I forgot to put my cap inEmbed
