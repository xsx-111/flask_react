Pretty Boys LyricsI like pretty boys
They get everywhere
I like to look at you
To see the clothes you wear
And some have beautiful shapes
And I like to look at you
I see their beautiful shades
And I love to talk to you
'Cause you're a real fine boy
'Cause you're a real fine boy
You're such a real fine boy
You're such a real fine boy
I like pretty girls
They get everywhere
I like to look at you
To see the clothes you wear
And some have beautiful shapes
And I like to look at you
I see their beautiful shades
And I love to talk to you
'Cause you're a real fine girl
'Cause you're a real fine girl
You're such a real fine girl
You're such a real fine girl
I like pretty girls
They get everywhere
I like to look at you
To see the clothes you wear
And some have beautiful shapes
And I like to talk to you
I see their beautiful shades
And I love to look at you
'Cause you're a real fine girl
'Cause you're a real fine girl
You're such a real fine girl
You're such a real fine girl
You're such a real fine girl
Yes, you're a real fine girl
Ah, such a real fine girl
Oh, such a real fine girl
Real fine girlEmbed
