Set-Up LyricsPlaying your game
Your mother substitute
She is she
That you never screwed
Playing your game
Her life revolves around, 'round and 'round you
You are the total investment
Can't afford to lose
You're the prize
For her sacrifice
A kiss in the morning
A kiss late at night
She's closing her eyes
To those possible lies
Keeping the doubts
Locked tight up inside
Playing your game
She's taking care of you: watching out for your head
When you're sick
She puts you to bed
She props you up
And she nurses you through
She's here to look after you
She's closing her eyes
To those possible lies
Keeping the doubts
Locked tight up inside
She's closing her eyes
To those possible lies
Keeping the doubts
Locked tight up inside
She's closing her eyes
To those possible lies
Keeping the doubts
Locked tight up inside
She's closing her eyes
She's closing her eyes
She's closing her eyes
She's closing her eyes
Playing your game
With the rules that you've set
We're on either side
Am I such a threat?
Playing your game
She's fulfilling your needs
She is your security
I may remark on your insensitivity
But you know she wouldn't listen to me
She wouldn't listen to me
She wouldn't listen to me
She's closing her eyes
To those possible lies
Keeping the doubts
Locked tight up inside
She's closing her eyes
To those possible lies
Keeping the doubts
Locked tight up inside
She's closing her eyes
She's closing her eyes
She's closing her eyes
She's closing her eyesEmbed
