Tenant LyricsSquatting on doorsteps
Following footsteps
Nocturnal habits are surveyed with interest
So we crawl into corners
Ignore any callers
And imagine our radiators clang for our neighbours
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
When we crawl on all fours
Upon the cushioned floor
Still they cling to the walls and knock on our doors
And the tendency for tenants is tenacity
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
The paint is cracked
And the paper peels
The plaster falls
And a body reels softly
Forty watt bulb swing from a light cloud
On lawnmower groan, the carpet has grown
But they have eyes at the keyholes and ears at the walls
Yes, they have eyes at the keyholes and ears at the walls
And the tendency for tenants is secrecy
Shh, shh
Ooh-ooh
Shh, shh
Ooh-oohEmbed
