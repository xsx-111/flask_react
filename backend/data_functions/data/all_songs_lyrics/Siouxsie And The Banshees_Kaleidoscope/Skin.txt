Skin Lyrics
Mink, seal and ermine
Smother fat women
I have a noble cause for skin
There's just too many of them
The only necessary cull
Curse the brain inside its skull
Just a bitch in the manger to the balances of nature

Cover me with skin
And accuse me of sin
But you know what I mean
There's just too many of them
Give me your skin
For dancing in
Give me your skin
For dancing in

Hairless and streamline
Fits like my own skin
Tattooed and sun-dyed
It's warm and it's human
There was too many of them
The animals like them
Shame about the smell but
They're fine, steeped in perfume
Cover me with skin
And accuse me of sin
Oh but you know what I mean
There's just too many of them
Give me your skin
For dancing in
Oh, give me your skin
For dancing in

Skin, skin, skin, skin
Skin, skin, skin, skin

Cover me with skin
And accuse me of sin
Oh but you know what I mean
There's just too many of them
Give me your skin
For dancing in
Oh, give me your skin
For dancing inEmbed
