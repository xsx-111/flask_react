Hybrid LyricsIt's a hybrid of me
I'm a hybrid of he
You're a misfit of me, I'm a misfit of you
In limbo
Carbon copies run blue
A reminder for you
But they're only skin deep crumpled shells in a heap
Marked "cheap"
Surrogate heads
Of a no-no domain
Shoulders form rows to make waves again
Catch the next plane
When you walked through the door
Marked "enter if you dare"
Reasoned with a friend marked "do not bend"
Bit on that finger marked "handle with care"
A tear soiled your cheek
A broken finger on the floor
A mess in sawdust, a shop window burst
No repairs
It's a hybrid of me
I'm a hybrid of he
You're a misfit for me, I'm a misfit for you
In limbo
Do you speak the lingo?
In limbo
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh-oh
Ohh-oh
Ohh-oh
It's a hybrid of me
I'm a hybrid of she
You're a misfit of me, I'm a misfit of you
In limbo
Do you speak the lingo?
In limbo
In limbo
Do you speak the lingo?
Ohh-oh, ohh-oh
Ohh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Ohh-oh, ohh-ohEmbed
