Red Light LyricsShe falls into frame with a professional pout
But the Polaroid's ignite upon seeing their subject
And the aperture shuts
Too much exposure
Voyeur sucks into focus floodlit the glossy kiss-pit
But as emulsion drips down, down
The aperture shuts
Too much exposure
Come into this room
Come into this gloom
See the red light rinsing
Another shutterslut wincing
The sagging half wit sister
Pretty, pretty picture
Of an ancient nipple shrinking
That Kodak whore winking
'Til the aperture shuts
Too much exposure
Come into this room
Come into this gloom
See the red light rinsing
Another shutterslut wincing
See the red light rinsing
When you see the red light
Wincing, wincingEmbed
