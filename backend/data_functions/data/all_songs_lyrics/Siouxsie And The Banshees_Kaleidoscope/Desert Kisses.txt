Desert Kisses Lyrics
Desert kisses in the sand
Engulfing joints, engulfing land
Tidal fingers cling to rocks
A deadly grip, a deadly lock

Cursed and pissed into the ocean
Wilfully caused a great commotion
But only for a stifled moment
Then it was back to still life motion

A sideways crawl, a sideways scrawl
The cancer crab is on us all
I kissed your face, I kissed the sand
I heard you sigh, there was no sound

Thrashed and spat back at the ocean
But there was nothing, no commotion
Just my lonely, stupid notions
Trapped again in still life motion

Sinking down with just my sound
Sinking down running on the moving ground
Sinking down
Sinking down without a sound
Sinking down sleeping on the moving ground
Sinking down
Desert kisses in the sand
Engulfing joints, engulfing land
Tidal fingers cling to rocks
A deadly grip, a deadly lock

Sinking down, the world is round
Sinking down, there's no-one around
Standing on the moving ground
Sinking down, the world is flat
There's no-one here to question that

Sinking down without a sound
Sinking down
Sinking down, the world was round
There was no-one around
Sinking downEmbed
