Paradise Place LyricsLook to the hills, now look at my face
Do you notice my eyes, are they in the right place?
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
There's a Mantovani backdrop to pucker-up a tummy tuck
A voice soft as lint mashed up with shades of pink
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
You can hide your genetics under drastic cosmetics
But this chameleon magic is renowned to be tragic
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Look to the hills, now look at my face
Do you notice my eyes, are they in the right place?
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
