Trophy LyricsOhh, ohh
Ohh, ohh

Headhunters, headshrinkers
And long distance runners
Dust gathers on mementos
Dust gathers on proud moments

Young voices grow thick and old
The cheers are distant wearing thin
Take it to the wall

To be hung on the wall
To be viewed by all
A tribute in the grand hall

Yes, they're locked away
Or polished every day
For the maintenance man
In the back of a van

Oh young voices grow thick and old
The cheers are distant wearing thin
Take it to the wall
To be hung on the wall
To be viewed by all
A tribute in the grand hall

Bring yourselves out from your showcase parties
Hmm, no but you've been shut away too long
You've been shut away too long

Frightened faces in the rain
Misplaced features lost down the drain
Oh, wash away and start again

To be, to be hung on the wall
To be viewed by all
A tribute in the grand hall
Take it to the wallEmbed
