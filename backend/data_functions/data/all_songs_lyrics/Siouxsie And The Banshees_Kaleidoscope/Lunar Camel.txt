Lunar Camel LyricsChasing a monsoon over the dune
Oh fly me to the moon, get me there soon
I don't have to prove I'll last longer than you
One hump or two, any handicap will do against you
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh
I'll be there soon, over the moon
I'll be there soon, over the moon
Over the moon, over the moon
Chasing a monsoon over the dune
Oh fly me to the moon, get me there soon
Ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahhEmbed
