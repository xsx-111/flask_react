Christine Lyrics
She tries not to shatter, kaleidoscope style
Personality changes behind her red smile
Every new problem brings a stranger inside
Helplessly forcing one more new disguise

Christine, the strawberry girl
Christine, banana split lady
Christine, the strawberry girl
Christine, banana split lady

Singing sweet savages lost in our world
This big-eyed girl sees her faces unfurl
Now she's in purple, now she's a turtle
Disintegrating

Christine, the strawberry girl
Christine, banana split lady
Christine, the strawberry girl
Christine sees her faces unfurl

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now she's in purple, now she's a turtle
Disintegrating
Christine, Christine
Christine, the strawberry girl
Christine, banana split lady
Christine, the strawberry girl
Christine sees her faces unfurl

Christine, Christine
Christine, Christine
22 faces
Disintegrating
Christine, Christine
