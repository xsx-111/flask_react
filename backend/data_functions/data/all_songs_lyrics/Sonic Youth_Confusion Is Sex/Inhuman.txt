Inhuman Lyrics
My body is a past time
My mind is a simple joy
I learn my lesson
The hardest way
But you don't know me
But you don't know me
A complete inhuman
Complete inhuman
Complete inhuman
Complete inhuman

My body is a past time
My mind is a simple joy
I learn my lesson
The hardest way
But you don't know me
But you don't know me
Complete inhuman
Complete inhuman
Complete inhuman
Complete inhuman

Inhuman, inhuman
Inhuman, inhuman
Inhuman
Inhuman
Inhuman
Inhuman
Inhuman
