The World Looks Red Lyrics
Push it away
The world looks red
People with fish eyes
The ground sucks
Walk on my fingertips
Displacing the fog
The weight of my body
Is too much to bear
The memory drained
The life from the doll
An ocean of insects
Worked like a sheet
The immovable fact
Buried my mind
In a horsehair coat
In a pile on the floor
Push it away
The world looks red
People with fish eyes
The ground sucks
Walk on my fingertips
Displacing the fog
The weight of my body
Is too much to bear
The memory drained
The life from the doll
An ocean of insects
Worked like a sheet
The immovable fact
Buried my mind
In a horsehair coat
In a pile on the floorEmbed
