Confusion Is Next Lyrics
I maintain that chaos is the future
And beyond it is freedom
Confusion is next and next after that is the truth

You got to cultivate what you need to need
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth

Stick your fingers in your mouth
Squeeze your tongue and wrench it out
From its ugly fucking cancer
Its ugly fucking cancer root

You got to cultivate what you need to need
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth

Chaos is the future and beyond it is freedom
Confusion is next and next after that is the truth
You got to cultivate what you need to need
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth

Stick your fingers in your mouth
Squeeze your tongue and wrench it out
From its ugly fucking cancer
Its ugly fucking cancer root

You got to cultivate what you need to need
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth
Sonic tooth

Tell nothing but the truth1Embed
