Freezer Burn  / I Wanna Be Your Dog Lyrics
Now Iâ€™m ready to feel your hand
And feel my heart on the burning sands

Now I'm gonna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Aw, come on!
Lose my heart on the burning sands

Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna...
Aw, come on!1Embed
