Protect Me You Lyrics
Protect me from ravagement
I am ten years old
I don't know what I do
Protect me myself
I am fourteen
There's nothing to do
Protect me yourself
I am sixteen
Protect me from starving
I am eighteen
Protect me you
I don't know what you do
Protect me demons
That come at night
I don't know what they say
Their whispering
Sends the night air away
And makes me forget
I hope they come
Again and again

I hope they come
Again and again
I hope they come again
Again
Again
