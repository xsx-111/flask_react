Making the Nature Scene Lyrics
Going back to these origins
The city is a natural scape
Order in the details
Confusion uproar in the whole
In nature reality is selection
The tool of critical intervention
Fragmentation is the rule
Unity is not taught in school
You are an unnatural growth
On a funny, sunny street
The city has forgotten you
Its symbols of its past
The meaning of its state
Its order of decay
Standing now in a column
And make the nature scene

Standing all in columns
Making the nature scene
Making the nature scene
Waiting to make their pay
There is no resistance to
The signs along the way
Standing all in columns
Waiting to make their pay
Making the nature scene
Waiting for the day
There is no resistance to
There is no resistance to
Salvation means to count on you
It just means to count on you
Make that nature scene
Making the nature scene
Making the nature scene
Making the nature scene

Going back to these origins
The city is a natural scape
Order in the details
Confusion uproar in the whole
In nature reality is selection
The tool of critical intervention
Fragmentation is the rule
Unity is not taught in school
You are an unnatural growth
On a funny, sunny street
The city has forgotten you
Its symbols of its past
The meaning of its state
Its order of decay
Standing now in a column
And make the nature scene

Standing all in columns
Making the nature scene
Making the nature scene
Waiting to make their pay
There is no resistance to
The signs along the way
Standing all in columns
Waiting to make their pay
Making the nature scene
Waiting for the day
There is no resistance to
There is no resistance to
Salvation means to count on you
It just means to count on you
Make that nature scene
Making the nature scene
Making the nature scene
Making the nature sceneEmbed
