The Beginning and the End LyricsLong you both laid in the sun's yellow stare
On the edge with eyes rolled back
In the waves we calling him
As he teetered on the edge
The waves were calling him
He had seen it, felt its might, bent under
Washing away
He thinks of you
Everything slows
Lights flashing through
The water flies
Over his head
You are me now
As you lay on my bed
The water flies
Over his head
You are me now
As you lay on my bed
This is what he'd always known
The promise of something greater
Beyond the water's final horizonEmbed
