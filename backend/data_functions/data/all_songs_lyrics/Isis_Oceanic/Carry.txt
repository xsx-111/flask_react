Carry Lyrics...as the water takes hold
Fills his lungs and crushes his body
Dust floats through sun in water
He sees like he's never seen before
(As you draw close, fall to me
I will carry you, true and free
Now that you are here, you'll swim with me
I am clutching you, true.)
...and the water carries him away
Soon he ceases to be at all
He sees like he's never seen before
He is light in waterEmbed
