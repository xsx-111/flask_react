False Light LyricsCome down on me, my sweet angel
Poison milk from that withering breast
Come down on me, sweet suffocation
Poison milk from that withered breast
Your mask is drifting
See what writhes beneath
Porcelain grin is cracking
Incest to uncoil
Your laugh spreads yawning
Black hole formation
Drown and the first real breath takes hold
Washed in a chill so peaceful, sink further
Hold his hand and crush it
The depth of the chasm is infinite
Discover bliss and serenity in drowningEmbed
