From Sinking LyricsHis time there so long
His fingers traced the endless walls he knew so well
And there the breaths were short and hard and thick with salt
And in this place he always knew he'd wake alone
Hands clutch in panic
In this place he built of sand homes that caved
The walls were weak with salty tears
Through the cracks in these walls he saw the sun
The sun dripped through the cracks and died
Shadows manage to betray
Like liquid was the sadness
Until into the light he stepped
In this truth he knew himself to be
From sinking sands he stepped into light's embraceEmbed
