Snowstorm LyricsWell I listen to the weather
And he's changed his tone of voice
And he can see it on the radar
Only seven hours away
Well there's gonna be a snowstorm
When the TV's goin' out
And they got nothin' else to think of
And they're letting me go home
Well I'm lookin at the snowflakes
And they all look the same
And the clouds are goin by me
They're playin some kind of game
Well you know there's a snowstorm
When the TV has gone out
And they got nothin' else to think of
And they're letting me go homeEmbed
