Cold Night Lyrics
I can't talk to today
The phone will have to ring
I'll keep the blind pulled down
I'll keep the bedroom locked

I think the window froze
I think my head is broke
I think my toes won't move
I think my head is broke


I think the window froze
I think my head is broke
I think my toes won't move
I think my head is broke
