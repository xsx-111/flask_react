Leave the Planet Lyrics
You said, "It's time to get your clothes on"
And you said, "It's time to leave the planet"
And you said, "Don't even bring your wallet"
And you said, "It's time to leave the planet"

You said that I could bring my guitar
And you said, "It's time to leave the planet"
You said that I could bring my guitar
And you said, "It's time to leave the planet"
