Ceremony Lyrics
This is why events unnerve me
Find it all, a different story
All the time the wheels are turning
Turn again and turn towards this time
All she ask's the strength to hold me
Then again the same old story
Word will travel, oh so quickly
Travel first and turn towards this time

I'll hurt them all, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time
Watching her, these things she said
Times she cried
And fail to wake this time


I'll break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, it's got to be this time
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Forever, forever (Forever)
Watching love grow, forever
Forever letting me knowEmbed
