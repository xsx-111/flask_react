Another Day Lyrics
Why close your eyes
To the sky today?
Why do you cry today
Just because the sky is gray?

'Cause it's okay if everyday
Is not the same way
It's just another way
That everyday is not the same

How can you see the sky
When you close your eyes?
How can you run away
Just because the sky is gray?

'Cause it's okay if everyday
Is not the same way
It's just another way
That everyday is not the same

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
'Cause it's okay if everyday
Is not the same way
It's just another way
That everyday is not the same

Oh, it's okay if everyday
Is not the same way
It's just another way
That everyday is not the same3Embed
