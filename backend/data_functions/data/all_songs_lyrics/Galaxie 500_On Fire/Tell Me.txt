Tell Me LyricsTell me one more time
You like the shoes I wear
Tell me as you leave
You really couldn't care
I bought all the drinks
And I paid for your friends
Jesus, can't you see
I'm going round the bend?
Step into my shoes
And see things as I do
Slip inside this house
You know I'd love you to
How come you can't see
The things you left behind?
How come you can't see
I'm going round the bend?Embed
