Blue Thunder Lyrics
Thinking of blue thunder
Singing to myself
Thinking how fast it moves
Feeling how it turns

I was singing something
Out on Route 128
Thinking how blue it looks
Singing out aloud

My, my blue thunder
My, my blue thunder
My, my blue thunder
Singing out aloud

Ah, la
La, la
La, la

My, my blue thunder
My, my blue thunder
My, my blue thunder
Singing out aloud
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, nah, nah, nah

I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away
I'll drive so far away

Ooh, blue thunder
Ooh, blue thunder
Ooh, blue thunder
Ooh, blue thunderEmbed
