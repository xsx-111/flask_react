Strange Lyrics
Why's everybody acting funny?
Why's everybody look so strange?
Why's everybody look so nasty?
What do I want with all these things?

I went alone down to the drugstore
I went in back and took a Coke
I stood in line and ate my Twinkies
I stood in line, I had to wait

Why's everybody acting funny?
Why's everybody look so strange?
Why's everybody look so pretty?
What do I want with all these things?

I went alone down to the drugstore
I went in back and took a Coke
I stood in line and ate my Twinkies
I stood in line, I had to wait

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na3Embed
