Victory Garden Lyrics
Last night in your window sitting, I saw you
Oh Adolf, I know the serious virgin does adore you
Won't you come back home tonight?
Can't you see everything's going to be all right?

Oh Adolf, don't say you've said goodbye now
Don't say you've said goodbye now
Oh don't say you've said goodbye

Your suit of chrome it once
Shined so bright
She told me you were
Out of sight
The serious virgin
She waits for you tonight

Oh, don't say you've said goodbye now
Don't say you've said goodbye now
Adolf, don't say you've said goodbye

Oh, don't say you've said goodbye now
Don't say you've said goodbye now
Oh don't say you've said goodbyeEmbed
