When Will You Come Home Lyrics
When, when will you come home?
Watchin' TV all alone
Watchin' Kojak on my own

Staring at the wall
And waiting for your call
When, when will you come home?
Oh, oh-oh

Now, I'm crawlin' on the floor
Makin' noises like a dog
Makin' noises you can't hear

Staring at the wall
And waiting for your call
When, when will you come home?
Oh, oh-oh-oh
