Plastic Bird Lyrics
And when I left your place
Gave me your plastic bird
You won it at the festival

Well I pulled both legs off
And then I broke its nose
And left it on First Avenue


And when I left your place
Gave me your plastic bird
You won it at the festival

Well I pulled both legs off
And then I smashed its nose
And left it on First AvenueEmbed
