Consciousness Raising As A Social Tool LyricsShe went looking for the solution
To a problem that did not exist
She found a answer and found some friends there
Consciousness raising as a social tool
She went looking for some direction
And to ease her loneliness somehow
She left her husband and she left her family
'Cause she prays to a new god now
Feeding the hunger, feeding the wonder
Feeding the need to believe
Looking for love and looking for someone
Looking for somewhere to beEmbed
