Hard to Laugh LyricsEveryone who sees you
Thinks you should be smiling
That girl, she's so pretty
That girl, she's so beguiling
Everyone who sees you
Thinks you should be happy
Thinks you should coo-coo her
And start acting all sappy
But it's hard to laugh when you know that she's been cheating
Had her hands around him and she's been giving it a beating
Well it's hard to laugh when you know that she's been lying
But you've got to laugh to prevent yourself from crying
People always ask you
Why you're so serious
'Cause your woman's got a body
That would make most men delirious
Yeah, she's got a body
Of that you're painfully aware
'Cause everytime you see it
You want to pull out your hair
But you know, it's it's hard to laugh when you know that she's been cheating
Had her hands around him and she's been giving it a beating
Well it's hard to laugh when you know that she's been lying
But you've got to laugh to prevent yourself from crying
Hard to laugh when you know that she's been cheating
Had her hands around him and she's been giving it a beating
Well it's hard to laugh when you know that she's been lying
But you've got to laugh to prevent yourself from crying
Hard to laugh
Hard to laugh
