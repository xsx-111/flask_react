Beautiful White LyricsShe buys stripes and colours
She wears purple and black
Her arms jingle and jangle
Her lips kiss me go smack
Her boots stomp and clomp to my door
The boots that cowboys wear
She's got sticky little tangles
In her big yellow hair
When she comes to me
In the dim morning light
She strips away the colour
Revealing beautiful white
Beautiful white
She's got a big grey overcoat
She just dumps on a chair
But she paid a lot for those trousers
She'll handle them with more care
Bought her that sweater for Christmas
Now it lies on the floor
One black sock then another black sock
She's hidden no more, ooh yeah
When she comes to me
In the dim morning light
She strips away the colour
Revealing beautiful white
Beautiful white
When she comes to me
In the dim morning light
She strips away the colour
Revealing beautiful white
Ah, when she comes to me
In the dim morning light
She strips away the colour
Revealing beautiful white
Beautiful white
Beautiful white
Beautiful white
Beautiful whiteEmbed
