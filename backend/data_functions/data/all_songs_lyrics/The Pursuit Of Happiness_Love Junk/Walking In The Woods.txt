Walking In The Woods LyricsI think it was her skirt that first attracted my eye
I looked at her shoes and then her face
She seemed soft and genuine
She smiled when she caught me so I diverted my look
And when I lifted my head she was back inside her book
And I wished I could walk over and just say hello
She's the kind of girl it would be nice to know
But that's not the kind of thing that you're likely to do
On a subway train at eight a.m. are you
(Chorus)
We walk the streets like we are walking in the woods
You never know when you see a pair of eyes
If you're seeing a friend
Two weeks later I was riding the same train
I saw her face and then I read the name
It said she'd been beaten pretty bad
And there was a picture of her grief-stricken Mom and Dad
And I wondered what happened to her books and her things
If she was wearing the same skirt and same earrings
And I'm sorry lovely one that I didn't get to meet you
But when you walk in the woods sometimes
The wolves are gonna eat youEmbed
