Tree Of Knowledge LyricsHe takes a bite of the apple
And a vision appears
He follows the light until the image is clear
He sees her porcelain beauty
Against another man's skin
He hears her moaning
A way she hadn't for him
With grotesque fascination
He watches until they fall still
He burns with the knowledge of good and evil
(Chorus)
He feels like he's falling, falling
Out of grace and into knowledge
He watches with dry eyes
Eyes that have changed
One final memory of the vision remains
Her playful body enjoying the sweet taste of sin
The dance of love that's now foreign to him
Day turns to night and night turns to day
He puts the illusions of his childhood away
With the new understanding he builds a world of his own
Outside the garden he finds the will to go onEmbed
