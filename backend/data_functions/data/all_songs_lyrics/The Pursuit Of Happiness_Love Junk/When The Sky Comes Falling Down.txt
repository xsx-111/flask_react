When The Sky Comes Falling Down LyricsOne night you might decide
You want to sleep so deep that you rise
Into the sky
One moment everything becomes clear
You want the sun to stop shining so bad
That you just close your eyes
(Chorus)
Oh, no, it's not the worst thing you can do
Oh, no, might be the only thing you can do
When the sky comes falling down
One morning you might look at yourself
And see your shadow has left you and
You're at the end
You discover you've stopped dreaming at night
And the man that you saw as a child
Is misshapen and bentEmbed
