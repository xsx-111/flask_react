New Mama Lyrics
New mama's got a sun in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm living in a dreamland

Changing times, ancient reasons
That turn to lies
Throw them all away
Head in hand, gift of wonders to understand
And open all the way

New mama's got a sun in her eyes
No clouds are in my changing skies
Each morning when I wake up to rise
I'm living in a dreamlandEmbed
