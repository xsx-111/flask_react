Mellow My Mind Lyrics
Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with the fish on the line

I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothin' on those feelings that I had
'Cause somethin's so hard to find
A situation that can casualize your mind

I've been down the road and I've come back
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track
Ain't got nothing on those feelings that I had

Baby mellow my mind
Make me feel like a schoolboy on good time
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied with the fish on the line1Embed
