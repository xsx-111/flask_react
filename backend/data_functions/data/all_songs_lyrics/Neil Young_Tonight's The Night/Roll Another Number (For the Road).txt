Roll Another Number (For the Road) Lyrics
It's too dark to put the keys in my ignition
And the mornin' sun is yet to climb my hood ornament
But before too long I might see those flashing red lights
Look out, mama, 'cause I'm comin' home tonight

Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standin' on the sound
Of some open-hearted people goin' down

I'm not goin' back to Woodstock for a while
Though I long to see that lonesome hippie smile
I'm a million miles away from that helicopter day
No, I don't believe I'll be goin' back that way

Think I'll roll another number for the road
I feel able to get under any load
Though my feet aren't on the ground
I been standin' on the sound
Of some open-hearted people goin' downEmbed
