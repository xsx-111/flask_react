World on a String Lyrics
You know I lose, you know I win
You know I call for the shape I'm in
It's just a game you see me play
Only real in the way
That I feel from day to day
Although the answer is not unknown
I'm searching, searching and how I've grown
It's not all right to say goodbye
And the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thing
It's only real in the way
That I feel from day to day
No, the world on a string
Doesn't mean a thingEmbed
