Lookout Joe Lyrics
A hip drag queen and a side-walking street wheeler
Comin' down the avenue
They're all your friends, you'll come to love 'em
There's a load of 'em waiting for you

Lookout Joe, you're coming home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times

Remember Millie from down in Philly?
She took my brain and forgot my name
The woman you were with was about the same
She took your money and left town

Lookout, Joe
You're comin' home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times
(Take it, Ben!)

Glory Hallelujah!
Will I lay my burden down?
Singing on the streets around
Look at that crazy clown!
(Look at!)
Remember Bill from up on the hill?
A Cadillac put a hole in his arm
But old Bill, he's up there still
Havin' a ball rolling to the bottom

Lookout, Joe
You're comin' home
Old times were good times
Old times were good times
Old times were good timesEmbed
