Alife LyricsNot nit
Not nit
No, not nit. Nit
Folly bololey
Alife my larder
Alife my larder
I can't forsake you
Or forsqueak you
Alife my larder
Alife my larder
Confiscate
Or make you late you, you
Alife my larder
Alife my larder
No nit not
No nit not
Nit nit folly bololey
Burlybunch the water mole
Hellyplop and fingerhole
Not a wossit, bundy, see?
For jangle and bojangle
Trip trip pip pip pip pip pip pip landerim
Alife my larder
Alife my larder
(I'm not your larder
Jammy jars and mustard
I'm not your dinner
You soppy old custard
And what's a bololey
When it's a folly?
I'm not your larder
I'm your dear little dolly
But when plops get too helly
I'll fill up your belly
I'm not your larder
I'm Alife your guarder.)Embed
