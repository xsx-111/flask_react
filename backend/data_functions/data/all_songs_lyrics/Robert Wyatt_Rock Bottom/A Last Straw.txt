A Last Straw LyricsSeaweed tangled in our
Home from home
Reminds me of your
Rocky bottom
Please don't wait for
The paperweight
Err on the good side
Touch us when we collapse
Into the water we'll go
Head over heel
We'll not grow fat inside
The mammary gland
Seaweed tangled
In our home from home
Reminds me of
Your rocky bottom
Please don't wait
For the paperweight
Err on the good side
Touch us when we collapse
Into the water we'll go
Head over heel
A head behind me
Buried deep in the sandEmbed
