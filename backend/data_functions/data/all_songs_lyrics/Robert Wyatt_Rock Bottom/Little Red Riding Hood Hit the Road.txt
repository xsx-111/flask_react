Little Red Riding Hood Hit the Road LyricsOrlandon't tell me, oh no
Don't say, oh good Godon't tell me
Oh dear me, heavens above
Oh no, no I can't stand it
Stop please, oh deary me
What in heaven's name?
Oh blimey, mercy me, woe are we
Oh dear, oh stop it, stop it
Ti pots ,ti pots ho ,raed hO
Ew era eow ,em ycrem ,yemilb hO
?eman s'nevaeh ni tahW
Em yraed ho ,esaelp potS
Ti dnats t'nac I on ,on hO
Evoba snevaeh ,em raed hO
Em llet t'nodoG doog ho ,yas t'noD
On ho ,em llet t'nodnalrO
You've been so kind
I know, I know
So why did I hurt you?
I didn't mean to hurt you
But I'll keep trying
And I'm sure you will too
I want it, I want it, I want it, give it to me
I give it you back when I finish the lunch-tea
I lie in the road, try to trip up the passing cars
Yes, me and the hedgehog, we bursting the tires all day
As we roll down the highway towards the setting sunEmbed
