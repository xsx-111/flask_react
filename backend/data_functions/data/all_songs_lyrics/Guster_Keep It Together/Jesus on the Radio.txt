Jesus on the Radio Lyrics
5 A.M. March 16
Jesus on the radio
You took a photograph of me
In your yellow bucket seat

It's too high
It's too wide
You're so low
You don't know
To get through
To go 'round

So don't look back
There ain't nothing there to see
Once was like you
Can't say I recognize that face
In the picture that you keep

It's too high
It's too wide
You're so low
You don't know
To get through
To go 'round
To get through
To go 'roundEmbed
