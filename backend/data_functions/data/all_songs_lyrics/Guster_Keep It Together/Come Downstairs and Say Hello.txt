Come Downstairs and Say Hello Lyrics
Dorothy moves
To click her ruby shoes
Right in tune
With Dark Side of the Moon
Someone, someone could tell me
Where I belong
Be calm, be brave
It'll be okay

No more messing around
And living underground
Or New Year's resolutions
By this time next year I won't be here
I turn on, turn on MTV
The volume's down
Lips move, they say
It'll be okay

To tell you the truth, I've said it before
Tomorrow I start in a new direction
One last time these words from me
I'm never saying them again
And I shut the light and listen as my watch unwinds
To tell you the truth I've said it before
Tomorrow I start in a new direction
I know I've been half asleep
I'm never doing that again
I look straight at what's coming ahead
And soon it's gonna change in a new direction
Every night as I'm falling asleep
These words repeated in my head

Voices calling from a yellow road
To come downstairs and say hello
Don't be shy, just say hello

To tell you the truth, I've said it before
Tomorrow I start in a new direction
I know I've been half asleep
I'm never doing that again
I look straight at what's coming ahead
And soon it's gonna change in a new direction
Every night as I'm falling asleep
Those words repeated in my headEmbed
