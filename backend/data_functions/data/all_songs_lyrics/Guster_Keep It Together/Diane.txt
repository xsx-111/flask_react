Diane Lyrics
The secrets that we keep
We say them in our sleep
And wrestle down our souls
If they would speak
I watched you board a train
In the London rain
And waved bye-bye
As you slipped out view
Diane
Diane

We'll make it out together
We'll make it out together
We'll make it out
We'll make it out

In your dreams when the smile now comes
You're mumbling words with a lazy tongue
We lie together when we say it's love
Who were you just thinking of, Diane?
Diane
Diane
I don't say it but I know you know
The theme returns so deep
And visits us in sleep
To define the you and I as we
So we pass the time
And occupy our minds
And close our eyes
And hope that we'll be fine
Diane
Diane

We'll make it out together
We'll make it out together
We'll make it out
We'll make it out

And I believe
(We'll make it out together)
In time you'll see
(We'll make it out together)
I'll come right back for you
(We'll make it out)
We'll make it out
(For you)
And I believe
(We'll make it out together)
In time you'll see
(We'll make it out together)
I'll come right back for you
(We'll make it out)
We'll make it out
(For you)Embed
