Homecoming King Lyrics
On your way to the best years of your life
Everyone's banging on their gongs
The sooner you leave, the sooner you're home

Back in Massachusetts
To your golden age
Where they tuck you in at night

You didn't see it coming
Now who you gonna wave to?
'Cause this time you're not homecoming king

Did you hear that?
Have you heard that sound before?
Do you even know where it is coming from?
It's getting too loud
It keeps on pushing you out
Into the arms of 1994

You didn't see it coming
Now who you gonna wave to?
'Cause this time you're not homecoming king
You're not homecoming king
You stand on your own
Wasn't what you hoped at all
Do you still recall it
You're giving dead-arms in the hall
Stay right where you are
You'll be half of who you were
When you always would win
So count the days 'til you give in

Back to Massachusetts
To your golden age
Where your crown is shining bright

You didn't see it coming
Now who you gonna wave to?
'Cause this time you're not homecoming king

You didn't see it coming
Now who you gonna wave to?
'Cause this time you're not homecoming king
You're not homecoming kingEmbed
