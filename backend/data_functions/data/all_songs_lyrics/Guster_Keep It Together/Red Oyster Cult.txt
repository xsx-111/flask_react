Red Oyster Cult Lyrics
Doesn't it bring you down
So many lights and sounds

Call your mom on the telephone
Tell her you're coming home
Tell her there's not a chance
You're ever going to change the world

If you want to be free take a sip of this tea
Join the red oyster cult
If you drink the whole cup you will never grow up
You will never grow old

Remember when you were fourteen
You'd paint ever picture so green

Call your mom on the telephone
Tell her your muse is gone
Tell her there's not a chance
You're ever going to change the world
Just a few drops away
You'll never want to change the world
If you want to be free take a sip of this tea
Join the red oyster cult
If you drink the whole cup you will never grow up
You will never grow old

Call your mom on the telephone
Tell her you're coming home
Tell her there's not a chance
You're ever going to change the world
Just a few drops away
You'll never have to changeEmbed
