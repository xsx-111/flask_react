Careful Lyrics
And you walked out
When I asked you to stay
As usual, you'll get your way
You closed the door
And stumble down to the street
Where you wring your hands
And you drag your feet there
Where the words can't find you
To crawl inside you

I'm ringing all the warning bells
Be careful or you'll hurt yourself
Others lie, lie, lie
They adore you
I'll be the one to tell
Be careful or you'll hurt yourself
Gonna try, try, try
'Til the morning comes

But you can't hide
Standing under these stars
They know everything
They know where you are
You're in your head
You're all turned around with it
And they're shining down
Their light to bring you back again
Back where I can find you
To crawl inside you
I'm ringing all the warning bells
Be careful or you'll hurt yourself
Others lie, lie, lie
They adore you
I'll be the one to tell
Be careful or you'll hurt yourself
Gonna try, try, try
'Til the morning

All you want to see is make believe
It's nothing
But way down underneath

I'm ringing all the warning bells
Careful you don't hurt yourself
Others lie, lie, lie
They adore you
I'll be the one to tell
Be careful or you'll hurt yourself
Gonna try, try, try
'Til the morning comesEmbed
