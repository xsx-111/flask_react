Two at a Time Lyrics
Once upon a time
Before the Lord, the skies they parted
So a few must die
To bring us back to where we started

Two at a time
Two at a time
Two at a time
Two at a time
Do what you're told

Each and every kind were gathered up
This tiny boat
The future of the world
For those that drowned, it made no sense
They should've known, because we told them so

Two at a time
Two at a time
Two at a time
Two at a time
Do what you're told
I can see the rains are coming
To wash away the filth and vermin
Hand in hand, we'll watch them running
Home

Now it's summertime
Long ago, the skies, they parted
So a few have died
To bring us back to where we started

Two at a time
Two at a time
Two at a time
Two at a time
Do what you're toldEmbed
