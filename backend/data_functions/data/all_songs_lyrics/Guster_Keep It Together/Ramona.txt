Ramona Lyrics
Ramona, where have you been?
I couldn't go to sleep 'til you came in
Ramona, you're Miss Oklahoma
And you miss Oklahoma
I'll get you what you want

'Cause there were days when a refrain
Would brighten our corner of Hickory Lane
When you would sing that song for me
Just like your favorite singer

And why'd you have to be so nice?
A wink and a girly smile
And why'd you have to punch my eye?
That was something
But did you want me to stay?

When I was younger and thought of myself
I never dreamed I'd become like this
A snap of your fingers, an end to the argument
Anything for you, love
'Cause there were days when a refrain
Would brighten our corner of Hickory Lane
When you would sing that song for me
The only one you know
But I know now, not at the start
We're going to pieces; we're falling apart
So come and sing that song for me
Just like your favorite singer1Embed
