Amsterdam Lyrics
I threw away your greatest hits
You left them here the day you split
Your bass guitar and Shaggs CD
Well, they don't mean that much to me
Right now I'm going through your things
These days I'm changing all my strings

Gonna write you a letter
I'm gonna write you a book
I want to see your reaction
I want to see how it looks
From way upon your cloud
Where you've been hiding out
Are you getting somewhere
Or did you get lost in Amsterdam

You won't get too far from me
Believing everything you read
You're wasted in the great unknown
And I am finally ready to dispose
Of all your vintage clothes
Your drugs and every secret code
Gonna write you a letter
I'm gonna write you a book
I want to see your reaction
I want to see how it looks
From way upon your cloud
Where you've been hiding out
Are you getting somewhere
Or did you get lost in Amsterdam

From your red balloon
You were a super hi-tech jet fighter
Floating over planet Earth
Come back down here
I'll show you where it hurts
Take this bitter pill
Is it easy to swallow

Gonna write you a letter
I'm gonna write you a book
I want to see your reaction
I want to see how it looks
From way upon your cloud
You're never coming down
Are you getting somewhere
Or did you get lost in Amsterdam
