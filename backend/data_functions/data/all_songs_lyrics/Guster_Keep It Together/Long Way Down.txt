Long Way Down Lyrics
Dreamt I was dead sleeping in your bed
Floated up from the ground and look down

Then finally I could see completely
Heard the angels' song

I know what you are
I could never tell
They sang what you are

This far away you're a miniature to me
Are you sorry you've almost disappeared?

Now I know what you are
I could never tell
They sang what you are

Now the notes are fading
And everything is turned around
And I can't help but think that
It's a long way down
All the lights are changing
And everything is turned around
And I can't help but think that
It's a long way down

And I know what you are
(And I know nothing)
I could never tell
(You said now)
They sang what you are
(And forever)
And I know what you are
(And I know nothing)
I could never tell
(You said now)
They sang what you are
(And forever)Embed
