I Hope Tomorrow Is Like Today Lyrics
I'm awake, you're still sleeping
The sun will rise like yesterday
Everything that we are now
Is everything we can't let go
Or it's gone forever
Far away

I hope tomorrow is like today
Like today

Don't you go away tomorrow
I don't think I could handle that
You're probably dreaming that you're flying on
Then you start fall but then you rise
And shine forever
Don't go away

I hope tomorrow is like today
I hope tomorrow is like today

Like today, ooh
Like today, ooh
Like today
I hope tomorrow is like today
I hope tomorrow is like today
I hope tomorrow is like today
Like todayEmbed
