Light Up LyricsLight up, everybody
Join us in this celebration
Light up and be happy
Sweet, sweet sounds will fill the air
Every day's a holiday when your lips meet mine
The music's keepin' time with our love
You are here, so am I and weather's quite divine
So pass me round your wine, lovely one
All I need is just one hit to get me by
'Cause baby when your here I'm halfway high
Light up, everybody
Join us in this celebration
Light up and be happy
Sweet, sweet sounds will fill the air
Light up, everybody

Light up and be happy
Sweet, sweet sounds will fill the air
Light up, everybody

Light up and be happy
Sweet, sweet sounds will fill the air
Light up, everybody

Light up and be happy
Sweet, sweet sounds will fill the airEmbed
