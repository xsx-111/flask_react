Suite Madame Blue Lyrics
Time after time
I sit and I wait for your call
I know I'm a fool, but what can I say?
Whatever the price, I'll pay
For you, Madame Blue

Once, long ago
A word from your lips and the world turned around
But somehow you've changed, you're so far away
I long for the past and dream of the days
With you, Madame Blue

Suite Madame Blue
Gaze at your looking glass
You're not a child anymore
Suite Madame Blue
The future is all but past
So dressed in your jewels
You made your own rules
You conquered the world, and more
Heaven's door
Ohhhhhh
Ahhhhhh

America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America
America, America, America, America

Red, white, and blue
Gaze in your looking glass
You're not a child anymore
Red, white, and blue
The future is all but past
So lift up your heart
And make a new start
And lead us away from here2Embed
