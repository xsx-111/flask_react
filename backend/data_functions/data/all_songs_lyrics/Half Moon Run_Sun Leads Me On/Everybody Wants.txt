Everybody Wants LyricsEverybody wants to be someone else
Everybody needs to be somewhere else
To fit right in
To be ordinary but not the same
To fit right in
To be ordinary and never change
Everybody started so helpless
Everybody could’nt even
Couldn’t take what they needed
Whether they know it
Whether they don’t mind not knowing at all
Whether they know it and forgot it
Whether they don’t mind not knowing at all
Everybody wants to be someone else
Everybody needs to be somewhere else
It’s the way you look
The way you talk about things
The way you are
The way you look
The way you talk about things
The way you are
You got a baby in your belly
Baby kill it with fire
In our kingdom of convenience
Where we sing in a choir
This is a conference of our failures
A union of regret
When we bow beneath the worry for what hasn’t happened yet
And all of this will come crashing down
To fit right in
To be ordinary and not the same
To fit right in
To be ordinary and never changeEmbed
