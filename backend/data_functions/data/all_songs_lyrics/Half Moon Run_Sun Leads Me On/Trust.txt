Trust Lyrics
Daylight breaks, the sorry kicks in
You tried to play both sides so that everybody wins
But it couldn't be, and it wasn’t enough
I need to know within a minute
If you’re looking for an exit
Texas State might feel like LA
But it’s really just a desert that dries you up
It’ll drag you down

There’s something in the way she’s getting fucked again

It’s not a riddle, it’s a stepping stone
Oh, it’s a slipping slope, it’ll drag you down
Never seen one like this before
And it may seem like everybody got a better looking body
But it won’t give you what you want
You just want what you can never have
Girl, I know I’ve seen this before

I want you more than ever
I want you more than ever
I won’t stop lying
There’s something in the way she’s getting fucked again
And she’s gonna hide it from the camera like a sin
Let’s bare something
It makes me want to take you in

Now that it’s cold
Like city lights that block out your star
Made to regret
Who stole your sunny days?
And did they teach you laughter?

Stay right there
Stay right there
Won’t you stay right there
Stay right there
Won’t you stay right there
Stay right there
Won’t you stay right there
Cause everybody wants you to just trust

Something in the way she
Something in the way she
Something in the way she
Something in the way she
Something in the way she1Embed
