Devil May Care Lyrics
You was always saying that the devil may care
That you're lost and can't be found
But now you've got to thinking we'll drive the coast from town to town
You keep trying to leave but the car keeps breaking down
You was always sleeping like the day before noon
Cause you're living on another one's time
Yeah once again we let out at dawn to skip the warden's fine
I said "Isn't that like stealing?"
You said "To steal is just to find"

Oh, you like to get to where you can't turn back
Where you should not be
Oh I believe that does it for you
That does it for me

You was always saying that anything that happens
Is no worse than anything else
That every moment matters and that truth can be your wealth
Yes every moment good or bad
In and of itself
You was always saying where your kid come from
They was hard but they was right
Then someone had an accident we said "Oh! What a pitiful sight"
Said someone flipped a pick-up truck and we heard that someone had died
 x 2
Oh, you like to get to where you can't turn back
Where you should not be
Oh I believe that does it for you
That does it for meEmbed
