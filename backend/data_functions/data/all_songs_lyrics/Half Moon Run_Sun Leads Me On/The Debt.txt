The Debt Lyrics
Never be sure, who pays the debt of our time
So rest assured, that you'll never pay the debt that is owed
Never be sure, who pays the debt of our time
So rest assured, that you'll never pay the debt that is owed

Who pays, who pays
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
(Who pays)
Who pays the debt of our time
Who pays, who paysEmbed
