Warmest Regards Lyrics
I wait, and I wait, to make a new start
A new beginning, but it feels like the end
And it takes one to know one
And I'm really not sure
If I can put things back together like before

I tried to see the bright side, the best way I know
The more I look up, the more I feel below
I followed my convictions
It was good 'til I got bored
'Til a voice beyond the grave kept calling more

I'm really trying to be there, for the people I know
The more we more we meet up, the more I feel alone
So I look at what surrounds me, and places I go
And the seeds all in this garden start to growEmbed
