It Works Itself Out LyricsIs it all that you need to get by to feel good?
Satisfied that you did what you could
It works itself out, works itself out
Just, is it time to take a look at what happened?
Oh, bound by your shame
When you made the mistake of reacting to reaction
You put your thoughts into the shape of a weapon
And all you did was learn a terrible lesson
That you can sell me out again
Sell me out again
There is a thought that drifts away
It's an echo
A memory replaced by distractions
It's a distraction

Your suicidal regrets and all
(My love, it has died)
I guess that you should know
(The dream is still alive)
You can sell me out again
Sell me out againEmbed
