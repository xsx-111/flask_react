Sun Leads Me On Lyrics
Well I'm going where the sun leads me on
Where I'm bound to ginger tea and sickly dogs
Where I always disappear but I'm never really gone
Yes I'm going, to where the sun leads me on

I am loath to lose anything
I've chose to refuse many things

Yes I'm leaving till the sun brings me home
'Til I'm no longer lost, just free to roam
And in this light, may i never be alone
'Cuz I'll be going 'til the sun brings me home

I am loath to lose anything
I've chose, to refuse many things

Yes, I'm leaving where the sun calls my name
Where the skies shed their weight and cease to rain
I have gone, but forever I remain
To be changing while the sun stays the same
Ooh, for the life of me
I'll be changing, but the sun stays the same1Embed
