Hands In The Garden LyricsI know that the night
Brings you down on your own knife
But it's alright
Darling, it's no crime
Better yourself
Know that got lost thou shalt
But it's all good
Darling it's no crime
I never thought I could be so happy
I'm looking on it from the inside out
Given the right circumstances
It could be safe to say
You're so misunderstood
Darling it's no crime
You got it in your head
That the best is behind of you
Darling that's not right
I never thought I could be so happy
I'm looking on it from the inside out
Given the right of circumstances
It could be safe to say
Darling it's no crime
Hands in the garden
That's where the future is
We'll all come around
To my country house
With your hands in the garden
That's where the future is
We'll all be ourselves
In that country house
Hands in the garden
That's where the future is
We'll all come around
To my country house
With your hands in the garden
That's where the future is
We'll all be ourselves
In that country house
I never thought I could be so happy
I'm looking on it from the inside out
Given the right of circumstances
It could be safe to say
That darling it's no crime4Embed
