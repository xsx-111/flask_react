Narrow Margins LyricsI can't live this way
Breaking all my rules again
Choking on my gin
You push 'til I give in
'Til the loser always wins
Somehow with his beckoning
Bruising with his threads
Confusing what he says
But I won't live that way
Though I kind of want to anyway
Kind of want to play
With all the pretty and the pure
When I return to the earth
I return to the dust
No more beauty by the pound
In this I do not trust
'Cause nothing forgives
Rules and narrow margins
In our life
It's rules and narrow margins
But I'ma slip by
I can't find the time
I don't know the future
I couldn't bring that past back
I waste what little time I have
But I swear I almost touched it
Yet it slipped between my fingers
Sent shivers down my spine
Cut a splinter in my mind
But it wasn't nothing, again
These rules and narrow margins
But our life
It's rules and narrow margins
So gonna slip by
Rules and narrow margins
Rules and narrow margins
And I'ma slip by5Embed
