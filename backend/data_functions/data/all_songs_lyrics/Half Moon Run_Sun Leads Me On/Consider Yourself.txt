Consider Yourself Lyrics
Consider yourself
Like a dumb machine
With a laser heart
And a leather spleen
Do you consider yourself
In the silver screen
In today's news
And the magazines

Consider yourself
Like a drum machine
You're keeping perfect time
It's your fantasy
Do you consider yourself
In an all-out war
There are no rules
You can do no wrong

Die for nothing
Sleepless soul
Now you gonna feel
It's better than you thought you were
Real
Convince yourself
It's a one-wayâ€‹ dream
You always come
But you can never leave
Brace yourself
That you can make the leap
This is the greatest place
That you'll ever see

Die for nothing
Sleepless soul
Now you gonna feel
There's only black and red
Out there

I'm running out
All out of road
Circling around
Brace yourself
Take a dive
This is the deadline
