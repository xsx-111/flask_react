When It Comes Lyrics
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again
When it comes
It comes abrupt
And it feels, it feels like trading brains with an imbecile, for real
Yes I feel emphatic about not being static
And not buying philosophies that are sold to me at a steal

Just when you thought it was safe to think
In comes mental piracy, no
What I'm looking for cannot be sold to me
I wish they all would stop trying
Because what I want and what I need
Is and will always will be free, now

It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, again
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again
When it comes
It comes unannounced
And it feels like a matador is taunting me
With his reddest red cloth and I am the bull
Yes I feel emphatic about not being static
And not eating the bullshit that's being fed to me no more
Because now I'm full

Just when you thought it was safe to think
In comes mental piracy
What I'm looking for cannot be sold to me
I wish they all would stop trying
Because what I want and what I need
Is and will always will be free, now
It's coming around again
They're letting it out again, againEmbed
