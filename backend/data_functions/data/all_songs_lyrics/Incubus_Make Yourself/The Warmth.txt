The Warmth Lyrics
I'd like to close my eyes, go numb
But there's a cold wind coming from
The top of the highest high-rise today
It's not a breeze cause it blows hard
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know
Watch the warmth blow away

So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

So do you think I should adhere to that pressing new frontier?
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?
Or should I hold my head up high
And throw a wrench in spokes by
Leaving the air behind me clear?

So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow... you grow old
So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

Before you grow old
Where did it go?
Where did it go?
Where did it go?
Where did it go?3Embed
