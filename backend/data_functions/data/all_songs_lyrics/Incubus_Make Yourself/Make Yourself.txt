Make Yourself Lyrics
If I hadn't made me
I would have been made somehow
If I hadn't assembled myself
I'd have fallen apart by now
If I hadn't made me
I'd be more inclined to bow
Powers that be would have swallowed me up
But that's more than I can allow
Bow, ah yeah
If you let them make you
They'll make you papier-mâché
At a distance you're strong
Until the wind comes
Then you crumble and blow away
If you let them fuck you
There will be no foreplay
But rest-assured
They'll screw you complete
Until your ass is blue and gray

You should make amends with you
If only for better health, better health
But if you really want to live
Why not try and make yourself?
Make yourself
Make yourself
If I hadn't made me
I'd have fallen apart by now
I won't let them make me
It's more than I can allow
So when I make me
I won't be papier-mâché
And if I fuck me
I'll fuck me in my own way

POW, fuck me in my own way
POW, fuck me in my own way
POW, fuck me in my own way
Fuck me in my own way

You should make amends with you
If only for better health, better health
But if you really want to live
Why not try and make yourself?

Make yourself
Make yourself
Make yourself
