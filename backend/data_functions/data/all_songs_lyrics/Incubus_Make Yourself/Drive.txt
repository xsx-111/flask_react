Drive Lyrics
Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty, stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself, how much I let the fear
Take the wheel and steer

It's driven me before, and it seems to have a vague
Haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm beginning to find that I
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh

So if I decide to waiver my chance to be
One of the hive
Will I choose water over wine, and hold my own and drive?
Ohh-oh-ohh
It's driven me before, and it seems to be the way
That everyone else gets around
But lately I'm beginning to find that when I
Drive myself my light is found
And whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh


Would you choose the water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive

Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there, yeah, ohh

Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Whoa-oh-oh, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Who-a-oh-oh-oh-oh31Embed
