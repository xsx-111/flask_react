I Never Lyrics
I'm only a woman
Of flesh and bone
And I wept much, we all do
I thought I might die alone

But I
Had never, had never, had never, had never, had never
Never, had never, had never, had never
Never, had never met you

So, baby, be good to me
I got nothing to give you, you see
Except everything, everything
Everything, everything
All the good and the bad

'Cause I've been bad
I've lied, cheated, stolen
And been ungrateful for what I have
And I'm afraid habits rule my waking life
I'm scared and I'm running in my sleep, for you
But all of the oceans, and rivers, and showers'll
Wash it all away and make me clean, for you
'Cause I
Had never, had never, had never, had never, had never
Never, had never, had never, had never
Never, had never, had never, had never
Never, never met you

So lets take a loan out, put it down on a house
In a place we've never lived
In a place that exists in the pages of scripts
And the songs that they sing
And all of the beautiful things
That make you weep
But don't have to make you weak

'Cause I
Never, have never, have never, have never, have never
Never, have never, have never, have never
Never, have never, have never, have never
Never, have never, have never, have never
Never, have never, have never, have never
Never, have never, have never, have never
Never, have never loved somebody
The way that I loved you1Embed
