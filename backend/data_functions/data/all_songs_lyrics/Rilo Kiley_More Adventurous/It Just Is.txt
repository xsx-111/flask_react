It Just Is Lyrics
Today is the day I realized that I could be loved
It echoed through the park last night
He wasn't our son
He belonged to everyone

And this loss isn't good enough
For sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys
Afraid of this life
That it just is
'Cause everybody dies
This loss isn't good enough
For sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys
Afraid of this life
That it just is
Everybody
This loss isn't good enough
For sorrow or inspiration
It's such a loss for the good guys
Afraid of this life
That it just is
'Cause everybody dies1Embed
