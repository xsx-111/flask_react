Ripchord Lyrics
Pull the ripcord
The ship has lost its sail
Your mama's got a new man
Your daddy always fails
And you're eating again at them
'Cause nobody loves you

And even fancy things
Have finally lost their charm
Wine and diamond rings
They never get you anymore
You're sleeping again, alone
'Cause nobody loves you

And ooh ooh ooh
They should have seen you
Should have known you
Should've known what it was like to be you

So come on, kid, look at what you did
I don't know if you meant it
But you did yourself in
And I was even havin' a good day
When I'd found out we lost you
So ahh ahh ahh
Oh oh oh and yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah oh oh
Ba-da-da, da-da da-da da

And ooh ooh ooh
She said, "it was in the singing
And the strumming
Oh man, I even saw it coming"1Embed
