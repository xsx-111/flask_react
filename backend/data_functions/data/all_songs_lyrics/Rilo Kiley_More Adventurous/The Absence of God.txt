The Absence of God Lyrics
The absence of God will bring you comfort, baby
And planning is for the poor, so let's pretend that we're rich
And I'm not my body or how I choose to destroy it
Folk singers sing songs for the workin', baby
We're just recreation for all those doctors and lawyers
There's no relief for the bleeding heart
'Cause they'll be losin' bodies tonight

And Rob says, "You love, love, love
And then you die..."
I've watched him while sleeping and seen him crying
With closed eyes

And you're not happy, but you're funny
And I'm tripping over my joy
And I just keep on getting up again
We could be daytime drunks if we wanted
But we'd never get anything done that way, baby
And we'd still be ruled by our dueling perspectives
And I'm not my perspective, or the lies I'll tell you every time

And Morgan says, "Maybe love won't let you down
All of your failures are training grounds
And just as your back's turned, you'll be surprised"
She says, "as your solitude subsides"
And Mike, I'll teach you how to swim
If you turn the bad in me into good again

And I say, "There's trouble when everything is fine
The need to destroy things creeps up on me every time
And just as love's silhouette appears
I close my eyes and disappear, tonight"

And something's gotta change
'Cause our love's the slowest moving trainEmbed
