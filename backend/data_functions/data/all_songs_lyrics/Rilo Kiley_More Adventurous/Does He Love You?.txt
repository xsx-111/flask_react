Does He Love You? Lyrics
Get a real job, keep the wind at your back
And the sun on your face
All the immediate unknowns
Are better than knowin' this tired and lonely fate

Does he love you?
Does he love you?
Will he hold your tiny face in his hands?

I guess it's spring; I didn't know
It's always seventy-five with no melting snow
A married man, he visits me
I receive his letters in the mail twice a week

And I think he loves me
And when he leaves her
He's coming out to California

I guess it all worked out
There's a ring on your finger
And the baby's due out
You share a place by the park
And run a shop for antiques downtown
And he loves you
Yeah, he loves you
And the two of you will soon become three
And he loves you
Even though you
Used to say you were flawed if you weren't free

Let's not forget ourselves, good friend
You and I were almost dead
And you're better off for leaving
Yeah, you're better off for leaving

Late at night, I get the phone
You're at the shop, sobbing all alone
Your confession, it's coming out
You only married him, you felt your time was running out

But now you love him, and your baby
At last, you are complete
But he's distant and you found him
On the phone pleading, saying
"Baby, I love you, and I'll leave her
And I'm coming out to California"
Let's not forget ourselves, good friend
I am flawed if I'm not free
And your husband will never leave you
He will never leave you for me4Embed
