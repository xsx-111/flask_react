More Adventurous Lyrics
Hm, it wasn't that rad

And it's only doubts that we're counting
On fingers broken long ago
I read with every broken heart
We should become more adventurous

And if you banish me from your profits
And if I get banished from the kingdom up above
I'd sacrifice money and heaven, all for love
Let me be loved, let me be loved

If my brain quits, well, I guess then that's just it
And if my hands stop working, you can call me lazy
And if I get pregnant, I guess I'll just have the baby
Let it be loved, let me be loved

I've been tryin' to nod my head
But it's like I've got a broken neck
Wanting to say "I will" as my last testament
For me to be saved and you to be brave
We don't have to walk down that aisle
'Cause if marriage ain't enough
Well, at least we'll be loved
I've felt the wind on my cheek
Comin' down from the east
And thought about how we are all
As numerous as leaves on trees
And maybe ours is the cause of all mankind
Get loved, make more, try to stay alive

I've been tryin' to nod my head
But it's like I've got a broken neck
Wanting to say "I will" as my last testament
For you to be saved and me to be brave
We don't have to walk down that aisle
'Cause if marriage ain't enough
Well, at least we'll be lovedEmbed
