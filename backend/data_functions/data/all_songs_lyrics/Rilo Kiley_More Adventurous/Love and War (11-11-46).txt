Love and War (11/11/46) Lyrics
All is fair in love, and we're in love
Now that everybody's dead, we can finally talk
Can vanity and happiness coexist?
All the lovers we've taken in direct view of the enemy

And we shift each other's body to accept the bullet

And continue the pleasure, the treasures of battle
It's only for the wounded, the purple-hearted

Why must you try to ruin my peace of mind?
And they were only words and I never meant them

I never loved you, even in my weakness
You were fuel for the fire, cannon fodder

When my grandpa drank, he fell and broke his face in two
When the cops arrived, he exclaimed, "I fought in World War II!"
And then they carried him to a darkened hospital room
And said, "No modern person here remembers you"
"And we can't identify the enemy
And it could be you, so it'll cost you"
"It already cost me my wife and my job, now what?"

When my mom and I went to identify the body
And I wanted to see it, but she wouldn't let me
I had to wait for the military cemetery
And when we got there, this is what she said to me:

"Love and war, in heaven, and in hell
You get what you deserve, you better spend it well
All is fair in love and war and love
A civil war like this, it always sells itself"Embed
