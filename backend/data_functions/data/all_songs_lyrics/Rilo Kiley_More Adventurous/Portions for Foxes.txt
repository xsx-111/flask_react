Portions for Foxes Lyrics
There's blood in my mouth 'cause I've been biting my tongue all week
I keep on talking trash but I never say anything

And the talking leads to touching
Then the touching leads to sex
And then there is no mystery left

And it's bad news
Baby, I'm bad news
I'm just bad news, bad news, bad news

I know I'm alone if I'm with or without you
But just being around you offers me another form of relief

When the loneliness leads to bad dreams
And the bad dreams lead me to calling you
And I call you and say "Come here"

And it's bad news
Baby, I'm bad news
I'm just bad news, bad news, bad news
And it's bad news
Baby, it's bad news
It's just bad news, bad news, bad news
'Cause you're just damage control
For a walking corpse like me, like you
'Cause we'll all be portions for foxes
Yeah, we'll all be portions for foxes

There's a pretty young thing in front of you
And she's real pretty and she's real into you
And then she's sleeping inside of you

And the talking leads to touching
Then the touching leads to sex
And then there is no mystery left

And it's bad news
I don't blame you
I do the same thing, I get lonely too
And you're bad news
My friends tell me to leave you
That you're bad news, bad news, bad news

We're bad news
Baby, you're bad news
And you're bad news
Baby, you're bad news
And you're bad news
I don't care, I like you
And you're bad news
I don't care, I like you
I like you1Embed
