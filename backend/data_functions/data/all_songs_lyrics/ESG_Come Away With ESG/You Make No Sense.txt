You Make No Sense Lyrics
You make no
You make no sense
You make no
You make no sense
You make no
You make no sense
You make no
You make no sense

Said you, you
You make no sense at all
I said you, you
You make no sense at all
Why do you lie, boy?
Why do you lie?
I said you, you
You make no sense at all

You make no
You make no sense
You make no
You make no sense
You make no
You make no sense
You make no
You make no sense
You make no
You make no sense

Said you, you
You make no sense at all
I said you, you
You make no sense at all
I said no
No

You make no
You make no sense
You make no
You make no senseEmbed
