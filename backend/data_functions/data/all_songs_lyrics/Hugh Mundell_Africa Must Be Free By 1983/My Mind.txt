My Mind Lyrics(Intro)
As I sit down thinking for a while
My mind spread a thousand miles
Thinking about the sunshine
That dry my clothes on the line
Thinking about the rain
That goes pitter-patter on my window pane
And the sinful people who call "my lord" inna vain
(Chorus)
My mind keeps going on
On and on and on
As I sing my little song
Thinkin' bout my girl who has left me and gone (2x)
(Outro)
Thinking about my mother
And my father too
Thinking about my sisters
And my brothers too
Thinking about my life
And my future wife
(Chorus)Embed
