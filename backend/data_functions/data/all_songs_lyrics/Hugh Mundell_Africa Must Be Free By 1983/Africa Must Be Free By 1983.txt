Africa Must Be Free By 1983 LyricsAfricans must be free by the year 1983
When I and I people shall rejoice
On the hills of Mount Zion
Africa must be free by the year 1983
We have worked too hard for the white man
In the blazing sun
No more work, no more beating
No more slavery, no more brutality
Africa must be free by the year 1983
I think itâ€™s time for us to live a better life
Freedom is what we want in Africa
Freedom
Freedom is what we want in Africa
Africans must be free by the year 1983
When I and I people shall rejoice
On the hills of Mount ZionEmbed
