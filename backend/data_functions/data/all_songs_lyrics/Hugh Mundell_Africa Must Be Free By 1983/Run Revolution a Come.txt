Run Revolution a Come Lyrics
Yeah, it's truth and nothing but the truth
Yeah, oh

Run, run, run, revolution a come
Run, run, run, revolution a come

Some a dem waan socialism
Some a dem waan capitalism
Some a dem waan communism
They all waan all kind of ism

Run, run, run, revolution a come
Run, run, run, revolution a come

The press must free, so we all can see
Your wrongdoings and, your brutality

Run, run, run, revolution a come

Equality is justice
Human rights stand for all
If we fight, Babylon kingdom will fall
Run, run, run, revolution a come
Run, run, run, run revolution

It a call, yeah, yeah oh oh
It a call, it a call, it a call
It a call, it a call, it a call
It's coming all the way
It's coming, coming every day
It getting nearer and nearer
We've got to runEmbed
