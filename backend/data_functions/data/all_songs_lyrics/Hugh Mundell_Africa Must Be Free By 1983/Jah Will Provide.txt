Jah Will Provide Lyrics
When we are hungry and have no food to eat
When we are thirsty and there's no water to drink
We won't give up from praising Jah
We'll never stop praising Jah

'Cause Jah will provide for I and I
Jah will provide, for I and I

When we are uneasy and nowhere's to mediate
When we are tired and no place to rest our head
We keep on praising Rastafari
We never deny our Selassie I

'Cause Jah will provide for I and I
Jah will provide, for I and I

When we are locked up in the dirty jailhouse
And are given to eat all kind of unclean mess
Blessed art I and I who put our trust in Jah
Blessed art I and I who hunger and thirst for righteousness
'Cause Jah will provide for I and I
Jah will provide, for I and I
Jah will provide, Jah will provide
Jah will provide
Jah will provide, for I and I and IEmbed
