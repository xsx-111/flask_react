Day of Judgment Lyrics
The day is coming up so soon
When there shall be the falling of all capitalist
When I and I people should go on home
And vanquish Pope Paul down inna Rome, down inna Rome

On the day of Judgement, it sure gonna be dread
Do you hear what I say? It's gonna be dread

After we will sure face the great big throne
Where Jah the Almighty He sits alone, He sits alone
So you all better be righteous, you hear what I say?
Oh no, repatriation is a must, yes it's a must

On the day of Judgement, it's sure gonna be dread
Do you hear what I say? It's gonna be dread

When I and I people shall stand so firm
And watch Babylon burn to the ground, burn to the ground
Pope Paul queendom falling down
And weakhearts are wearing a frown, a frown
On the day of Judgement, it sure gonna be dread
Hear what I say, it's gonna be dread

It's dread, it's dread and the gully gonna run red
Yeah, yeah, woah

So humble yourself my black brothers
'Cause we know repatriation
It's a must, yes it's a must
So do the things you know are right
It will look better in Jah Jah sight

It's dread, it's dread, it's dread
Yeah it's gonna be dread
It's gonna be dreadEmbed
