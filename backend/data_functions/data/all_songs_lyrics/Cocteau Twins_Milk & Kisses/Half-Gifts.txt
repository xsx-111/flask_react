Half-Gifts Lyrics
It's an old game, my love
When you can't have me, you want me
Because you know that you're not risking anything

Intimacy is when we're in the same place
At the same time
Dealing honestly with how we feel
And who we really are
That's what grown-ups do
That is mature thinking
Well I'm still a junkie for it
It takes me out of my aloneness
But this relationship cannot sustain itself

Intimacy is when we're in the same place
At the same time
Dealing honestly with how we feel
And who we really are
That's what grown-ups do
That is mature thinking
I just have to know how to be in the process
Of creating things in a better way
And it hurts but it's a lie that I can't handle it
I still have a world of me-ness to fulfill
I still have a life, and it's a rich one even with mourning
Even with grief and sadness

I still care about this planet
I am still connected to nature
And to my dreams for myself
I have my friends, my family
I have myself
I still have me
I have my friends, my family
I have myself
I still have me1Embed
