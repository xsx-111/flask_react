Treasure Hiding LyricsThe lips, the heart
Feel the fire
Feel the soul here
Feel the fire
The heart, the soul
Illuminated
(The lips, the heart)
There’s a fire
(There’s a flame, burn in my name)
Feel it ache now
So handsome for her
(The heart, the soul)
Can begin (can begin)
(And better than me)
Feel the fire
(The lips, the heart)
Feel the fire
(There’s a flame, burn in my name)
Feel the fire
(The heart, the soul)
Can begin (can begin)
(And better than me)
The lips, the heart
The heart, the soul
Conscious, chosen traps (illuminated)
Treasure hiding
Scared, a sense of steel
Love brought, soon I was drowning
Deep, without light
Down, down and full of tears
Collective interests start
Fire hairs had no
Belly focus
Light the discards
Purified love, go on
Constancy
Purifies mistakes
And with substance
Reproduces fire
Laced with a fire
Your heart
Illuminated
The lips, the heart
Feel the fire
Feel the fire
The heart, the soul
Illuminated, illuminated1Embed
