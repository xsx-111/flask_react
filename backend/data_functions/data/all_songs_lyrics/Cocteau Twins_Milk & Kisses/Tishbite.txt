Tishbite Lyrics
I’m at a loss
Don’t know what to do
Feel like I want him less now
Could he just hold me?
Don’t feel safe enough to
Surrender into sensation
Afraid but look what happens when
I don’t risk losing you
There’s no guarantees
I need to know
If the response is cold
I’m in the wrong place

Is it like a dream?
Or does it seem grounded and real?
Is it like a dream?
Or does it seem grounded and real?

I feel a connection
A deep connection
But it’s not reflected
In time spent together
It’s reflected psychically
Emotionally
Is it like a dream?
Or does it seem grounded and real?
Is it like a dream?
Or does it seem grounded and real?

This mountain of pleasure
I want to get lost in it
Sleep like a baby
Still close
Still close
Until I don’t know where you end
Or I begin
Until I just carry it in me
I wanna get lost
Wanna get lost
Wanna get lost
Lost in it
We’re still close
Still closeEmbed
