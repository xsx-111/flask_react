Eperdu Lyrics
No way
It ever comes to pass
It's the sure movement
She's happy being there
Far our road
Before the star beat
Now there's no bond
Greener
For I am
I am happy
Oh
Shine on
In our
Flowered air
Our walls
Crumbled in

Fear of some
Who you know
(Who you love, someone you can love)
Feel strong, belong
A certain value to
Someone you love
(Because in the end, you need someone to love)
Weâ€™ll be that kingdom
Real peace
(Someone to love)
(Because in the end, you need someone to love)
Your soul's gone far
Floating slowly

Golden days
Of your love
I felt sheltered in
And thank you
In some far away field
We have come down spread
Jumbled in
Strange parts
Be younger than
My young self
Your bond (your heart)
Greener
Love is
My guide
Peace in grasp
Father, new
Fear of some (someone)
Who you know
(Someone you can love)
Feel strong, be
A certain value to
Someone you love
(Because in the end, you need someone, you really do)
I was charmed
I was charmed
I was charmed
I was charmedEmbed
