Rilkean Heart Lyrics
Rilkean heart I looked for you
To give me transcendent experiences
To transport me out of self and aloneness
And alienation into a sense of
One-ness and connection ecstatic and magical
I became a junkie for it
I came looking for the next high
And I'm sorry I've been
Putting the search on the wrong place

I understand that you're confused
Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then
The reality

With cleaning up my emotion of life
And I'm getting in touch with myself
I'm beginning to ground myself
In my own sense of being as an entity
One entity on the planet
Becoming truly self-reliant and become connected
With something beyond me
That is where I have to go
I'm so sorry I've been
Putting the search on the wrong place
You're lost and don't know what to do
But that's not all of you
That's your reality today
And that is all okay
I understand that you're confused
Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then
The reality


You're lost and don't know what to do
But it's not all of you
That's the reality today
And now it's all okay
I understand that you're confused (Rilkean heart)
Feeling overwhelmed
Well that's a feeling state from then
The reality2Embed
