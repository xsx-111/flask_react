Seekers Who Are Lovers Lyrics
Let’s fight gracefully
A love as big as a risk fills you up
And you can’t put it down
The breath of God in my mouth
A love I can taste, got kissing paste
You know our paths have crossed before
Clove of saliva
Heated through your love
I can’t stop hungering for the new yes
I forgot the use
My head fell out of the sky and it crashed into my palms
Jesus, God, Valentine

Love, on the tip of it
You looked nervous
Like I wanted sweet sex
Some seek it
You are a woman just as you are a man

Deep in hunger
It’s a magic love
Like a flash-flood of heat
I was choking on the blood
Which camouflaged a flock of soul
Whose misty fire amuses so
Kneeling by the hand
Which was promising a way
It was poor essence, an untruth
Not in half-part it’s yourself
I stick my heels in bloody well
And send Lucifer into Hell

Love, on the tip of it
You looked nervous
Like I wanted sweet sex
Some seek it
You are a woman just as you are a man
Love, on the tip of it
You looked nervous
Like I wanted sweet sex
Some seek it
You are a woman just as you are a man
Love, on the tip of it
You looked nervous
Like I wanted sweet sex
Some seek it
You are a woman just as you are a man1Embed
