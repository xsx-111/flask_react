Serpentskirt Lyrics
It’s hard to judge, I get used to it
A living, sole survivor
Thought I’d be more sensitive
A living, sole survivor

Had to find a job
Had to find a job
Those could be my clothes
What you have always been
You were an outlaw suddenly
Once I find a job
Once I find a job

Thought I’d found a seat to preach
Moving, less surviving
Product in a media court
Moving, less surviving

Had to find a job
Once I find a job
I should arrive there
Where you have always been
You were an outlaw suddenly
Once I find a job
Once I find a job
Had to find a job
Once I find a job
Those could be my clothes
What you have always been
You were an outlaw suddenly
Once you find a job
You never earn enough

And you’re speaking your heart
You saw the laddie
Call a memory
Don’t accept them for beauty
You didn’t matter
He’s just a laddie
Call a memory
Don’t accept them for beauty
You shook so hard
You saw the laddie
Call a memory
Don’t accept them for beauty
You, who to call
You saw the laddie
Part of him was living proof
A living, sole survivor
Thought I’d be more sensitive
A living, sole survivor

Such a great fuss
Living for
Living for
A something
A jobEmbed
