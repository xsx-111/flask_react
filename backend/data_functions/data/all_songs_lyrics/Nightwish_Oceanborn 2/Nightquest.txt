Nightquest LyricsBorn to the false world the wanderer
Storyteller the pied piper
On a quest for immortality
Gathering a troop to find the fantasy
Lead by a maid queen of the night
Voice of angel such a divine sight
An amazon to fight and cure
This reality with her feline lure
Patriotic to the promised land
Of never-waking dream
Nightquest a quest not for the past
But for tomorrow to make it last
Simply the best way to walk this life
Hand in hand with a dreamer's mind
Enter the realm don't stay awake
The dreams remain they only break
Forget the task enjoy the ride
And follow us into the night
A merry minstrel with his fingers fast
Playing his lute charming every lass
Joins the troop with a glitter in his eye
"Shall I find fame - or shall I die?"
Warrior with power along the path
A hammerheart his gallantry to last
Rhythm of sirens enemies take heed
For in this war laws are in silent sleep
Patriotic to the promised land
Of never-waking dream
Nightquest a quest not for the past...
Come to the Elfland the eldest said
In my guidance you shall not be afraid
I am the mastermind the wizard to show the way...
Nightquest a quest not for the past...
First ones to walk this path of night
Lady in black lady in white
Followed by legions of night-time wanderers
Guardians of the halls of heart
When we from my homeland depart
To challenge the gods of emptiness
May the quest begin!1Embed
