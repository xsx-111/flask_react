Spring and by Summer Fall LyricsTell me where you've seen my life
I look in your eyes and can only see my own complexion
Tell me where you've been my life
I've been watching you spring by summer fall when some one called
Tell me where you've seen my life
You've been biting my hands and knocking me down down to the ground
Tell me where you've been my life
I see only what you see, face who you face, be who you want to be
Clashing lies and clashing thighs
Clashing chasing changing minds
Tell me what you've seen tell me where you've gone
Tell me where you've been tell me what you saw
Clashing lies and clashing thighs
Clashing chasing changing minds
Tell me what you've seen tell me where you've gone
Tell me where you've been tell me what you sawEmbed
