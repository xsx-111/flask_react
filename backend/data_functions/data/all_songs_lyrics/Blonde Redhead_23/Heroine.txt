Heroine LyricsTell me why talk to lie, tell me why tell me why
Oh you were gonna run with me
Tell me why talk to lie, tell me why, tell me why
Oh you were gonna run with me
Show you how, show you how, show you how when to stop
Oh you were gonna run with me
Roland takes the sea, but he goes without me
Roland takes the trip, but he goes without me
Roland makes the move, but he goes without me
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why you're the one
Oh you were gonna run with me
Walk you through, walk you through, I walk you through my story
Oh you were gonna run with me
Roland takes the sea, but he goes without me
Roland takes the trip but he goes without me
Roland makes the move, but he goes without me
He goes without me
Roland takes the sea but he goes without me
Roland takes the trip but he went without me
Roland, he goes without me
Roland, he goes without me
Roland ...Embed
