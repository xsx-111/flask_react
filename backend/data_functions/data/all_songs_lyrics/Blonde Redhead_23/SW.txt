SW LyricsIt's not, it's not what you give but it's what you kept
It's not, it's not who you kill but it's who you left
I am I am running in my head
I am I am lying on my left
I am I am growing in my bed
I am I am ...
It's not, it's not how you speak but it's what you said
It's not, it's not what you seek but it's what you have
I am I am running in my head
I am I am lying on my left
I am I am growing in my bed
I am I am...
It's not, it's not what it seems ... It's not what it seems
It's not, it's not what you leave but it's what you hold
I am I am running in my head
I am I am lying on my left
I am I am growing in my bed
I am I am ...Embed
