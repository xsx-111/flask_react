The Dress LyricsTears you see on my face, you do have something to do with
Fear starts creeping up when you have so much to lose
Your love waits you while you're cheating
Lightning strikes you when you're moving
The light you see in my eyes, you do have something to do with
Play the game namely love, play it like you have nothing to lose
Horse loves you when you move with him
People hate you when you're changing
Don't let the dress trick you
I love you less now that I know you
I won't count the scars again
I love you less now that I know you
The glow you see on my face, you do have something to do with
Fear starts creeping up when you have so much to lose
Your love wait you while you're cheating
Lighting strikes you when you're moving
Don't let me wander away
I love you less now that I know you
Don't let the dress trick you
I love you less now that I know you
I won't count the scars again
Because I love you3Embed
