Dr. Strangeluv LyricsLooking everywhere, I see nothing but people
Looking everywhere, but I see nothing but people
Where have they gone? I always thought I could never leave them
They are calling me, but they don't know I can't stay all night long
Hey, Dr Strangeluv so sad, isn't it true ?
(You left without goodbye)
Hey, Dr Strangeluv so bad, isn't it true ?
(You left without goodbye)
Looking everywhere, keep my fire going
Cold look in their eyes, cold air in their hearts
They are calling me, I always thought I could save them all
They are calling me, they don't know I can't stay all night long
Hey, Dr Strangeluv so sad, isn't it true ?
(You left without goodbye)
Hey, Dr Strangeluv so bad, isn't it true ?
(You left without goodbye)
Looking everywhere, keep my fire goingEmbed
