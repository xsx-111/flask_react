Publisher LyricsFather don't you go
Let's just take a walk in the afternoon ... look at me
Mother don't you know
You can only see me through a clouded sphere ... look at me
Walk out on a limb leaning on a cloud that isn't still reveals
Looking down a cliff it isn't fun it's communicating fear
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Father don't you know
You have made me into a quiet man ... look at me
Mother don't you go
You are a long way away from me ... look at me
I see you as you see me ... look at me
Change your heart cause I am already spoken for
Change your heart cause I am already spoken for
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Say it to my face and say what you know every one says
Say what you say, say it like a cat
Say it to my face and say what you know every one saysEmbed
