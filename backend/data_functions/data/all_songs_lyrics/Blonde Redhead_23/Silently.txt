Silently LyricsSilently, I wish to sail into your port, I am your sailor
Quietly, I drop my weight into your sea, I drop my anchor
I sway in your waves, I sing in your sleep
I stay till I'm in your life
I realize now you're not to be blamed my love
You didn't choose your name my love
You never crossed the seven seas
I realize now you're not to be blamed my love
You didn't choose your name my love
You never crossed the seven seas
Oh, sweet creature
I know exactly how you feel
Your clock is ticking, tick tack tick tack
Your heart is beating tum tum tum tum tum
Silently, I wish to sail into your port, I am your sailor
Quietly, I drop my weight into your sea, I drop my anchor
I realize now you're not to be blamed at all
You didn't choose your name my love
You die a little in my arm
I realize now you're not to be blamed at all
You didn't choose your name my love
We never crossed the seven seas
I realize now you die a little in my arm
Before you even taste my love
We never crossed the seven seas
I realize now you re not to be blamed at all
You didn't choose your name my love
You die a little in my arm
I realize now1Embed
