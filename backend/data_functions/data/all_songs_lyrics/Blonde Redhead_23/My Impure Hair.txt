My Impure Hair LyricsI've lost my key
I've gone too far
Was it enough to make you sick ?
Maybe I live again, but would I lose again my virginity ?
Oh, my virginity
I'm shaped to get in your way
But in the end
We defend our decadence
You never wept like that
Whatever lost I won't forget about you
Oh, forget about you
It's not what I said, it's what you said
It's what you did that belongs to everyone
It's not what I hate, it's what you hate
Its decadence belongs to everyone
One day I lie next to you and you stroke my impure hair
You touched my heart
Oh, forget about you
You touched my heart
You touched my heart
Oh, forget about you
Oh, my virginityEmbed
