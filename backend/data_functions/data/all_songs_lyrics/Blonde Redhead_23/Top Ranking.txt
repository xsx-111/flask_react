Top Ranking LyricsWe've come a long way to where the mountain is high
I take my cedar to where the mountain is high
What I need is a peace and quiet
What we see is an illusion
I have no reason to confuse them
I have no reason to confuse my brothers
They have real shotguns
They were baby killers
But I warned you many times that they will burn down your house
Not today (what can I do)
Not today (to make it better)
What we need is a persuasion
What you give is retaliation
I hope one day we meet again
I hope one day we love one another
They were young soldiers
They were old liars
But I heard the rumor that they will burn down your house
Not today (what can I do)
Not today (to make it better)
They will burn down your house
They will burn down your houseEmbed
