Baba Lyrics
I've seen them kneel with bated breath for their ritual
I've watched this experience raise them to pseudo higher levels
I've watched them leave their families in pursuit of your nirvana
I've seen them coming to line up from Switzerland and America

How long will this take, baba?
And how long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?

I've seen them give their drugs up in place of makeshift altars
I've heard them chanting "Kali Kali" frantically
I've heard them rotely repeat your teachings with elitism
I've seen them boasting robes and foreign sandalwood beads

How long will this take, baba?
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
Ave Maria

Ave Maria

I've seen men overlooking God in their own essence
I've seen their upward glances in hopes of instant salvation
I've seen their righteousness mixed without loving compassion
I've watched you smile as the students bow to kiss your feet

How long will this take, baba?
How long have we been sleeping?
Do you see me hanging on to every word you say?
How soon will I be holy?
How much will this cost, guru?
How much longer till you completely absolve me?
Give me strength, all-knowing one
How long 'til enlightenment?
How much longer until you completely absolve me?
