Your Congratulations Lyrics
I wouldn't have compromised as much
So much of myself for fear of having you hating me
And I would've sung so loudly
It would've cracked myself
And I became self conscious
Of anything exuberant
I wouldn't have sold myself short
I wouldn't have kept my eyes glued to the ground
If I had've known my invisibility
Would not make a difference
I would've run around, screaming proudly
At the top of my voice
Ohh-aah

I wouldn't have said it was in fact luck
I'm talking idealism here
I would not have been so self deprecating
And I wouldn't have cowered
For fear of having my eyes scratched out
I wouldn't have cut my comfort off
I wouldn't have feigned needlessness
And I would not have discredited
Everyone of their compliments
It was your approval I wanted
Your congratulations
Ohh-aah-ohh1Embed
