So Pure Lyrics
You from New York
You are so relevant
You reduce me to cosmic tears
Luminous more so than most anyone
Unapologetically alive
Knot in my stomach and lump in my throat

I love you when you dance
When you freestyle in trance
So pure, such an expression
I love you when you dance
When you freestyle in trance
So pure, such an expression

Supposed former infatuation junkie
I sink three pointers and you wax poetically

I love you when you dance
When you freestyle in trance
So pure, such an expression
I love you when you dance
When you freestyle in trance
So pure, such an expression
Let's grease the wheel over tea
Let's discuss things in confidence
Let's be outspoken, let's be ridiculous
Let's solve the world's problems

I love you when you dance
When you freestyle in trance
So pure, such an expression
I love you when you dance
When you freestyle in trance
So pure, such an expression
