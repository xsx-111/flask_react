UR Lyrics
Burn the books
They've got too many names and psychosis
All this incriminating evidence would surely haunt me
If someone broke into my house
Suits in the living room
Do you realize guys I was born in 1974?
We've got someone here to explain your publishing
We know how much you love to be in front of audiences

Hopeful you are
Schoolbound you are
Naive you are
Driven you are

Take a trip to New York with your guardian
And your fake identification
When they said, "Is there something anything
You'd like to know young lady?"
You said, "Yes, I'd like to know what kind of people
I'll be dealing with"

Precocious you are
Headstrong you are
Terrified you are
Ahead of your time you are
Don't mind our staring
But we're surprised you're not in a far-gone asylum
We're surprised you didn't crack up
Lord knows that we would've
We would've liked to have been there
But you keep pushing us away

Resilient you are
Big time you are
Ruthless you are
Precious you are
