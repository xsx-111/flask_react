Would Not Come Lyrics
If I make a lot of tinsel then people will want to
If I am hardened, no fear of further abandonment
If I am famous, then maybe I'll feel good in this skin
If I am cultured, my words will somehow garner respect

I, I, I would throw a party, still it would not come
I, I, I would bike, run, swim and still it would not come
I, I, I go traveling and still it would not come
I, I, I would starve myself and still it would not come

If I am masculine, I will be taken more seriously
If I take a break, it would make me irresponsible then
If I'm elusive, I will surely be sought after often
If I need assistance then I must be incapable

I, I, I be filthy rich and still it would not come
I, I, I would seduce them and still it would not come
I, I, I would drink vodka and still it would not come
I, I, I have an orgasm still it would not come

If I accumulate knowledge, I'll be impenetrable
If I am aloof no one will know when they strike a nerve
If I keep my mouth shut, the boat will not have to be rocked
If I am vulnerable I will be trampled upon
I, I, I would go shopping and still it would not come
I, I, I leave the country and still it would not come
I, I, I would scream and rebel, still it would not come
I, I, I would stuff my face and still it would not come

I, I, I be productive and still it would not come
I, I, I be celebrated, still it would not come
I, I, I be the hero and still it would not come
I, I, I renunciate and still it would not come2Embed
