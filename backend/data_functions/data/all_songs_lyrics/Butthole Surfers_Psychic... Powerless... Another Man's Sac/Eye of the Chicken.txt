Eye of the Chicken LyricsI can't believe I'm talking about
That champagne that I vomited
When I was checking my brother's diapers
It's okay because then again
I don't think about my youth
And all the good two lips that I ate
Hoping that I had good parents and knowing that I did
Even though my mother threw furniture at me
Even though I tell my friends that it all...Embed
