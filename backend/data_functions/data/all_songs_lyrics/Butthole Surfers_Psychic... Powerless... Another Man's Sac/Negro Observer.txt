Negro Observer LyricsWell, I don't know what
Well, I don't know who
Well, I don't know where or when
Well, I don't know it
Well, I don't know they
Well, I don't know thick or thin
Landing in empty parking lots
In deserted discount stores
Negro Observers are landing by the scores!
Dropping down in low-rider cars
From Pluto, Venus, and Mars
Negro Observers are counting heads in singles bars!
Walking up and down the empty boulevards
Negro Observers with muscles that are very hard
Walking up and down and a-falling everywhere
Negro Observers flying through the air
They don't know what goes on
But the Negro Observers are big and strongEmbed
