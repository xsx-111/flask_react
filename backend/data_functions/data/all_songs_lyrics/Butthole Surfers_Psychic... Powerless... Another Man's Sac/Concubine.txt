Concubine LyricsIt's in my veins...
My eye...
Oh, I feel in my concubine
You are whores, like my lack of eyes
Ooh, my concubine, you scrape my life
Just like that scapula
I still have to use that scapula
Oh, just like my concubine
You are just like my concubine
Oh, I see ya, you're like a Dracula
You suck-a blood, you pork a porcupine
You are, ooh, my concubine
You took my scapula
You are my concubine
My concubine, my concubine
My concubine, ah
I've seen the simple, simple kind of sucking fucker
Is it round or is it square?Embed
