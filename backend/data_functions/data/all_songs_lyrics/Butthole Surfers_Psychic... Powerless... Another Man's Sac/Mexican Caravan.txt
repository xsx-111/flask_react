Mexican Caravan LyricsTake me
The Mexican caravan
South of
South of the Rio Grande
Take me to that amigo town
Where I can score some of that heroin brown
Take me
Mexican caravan
South of
South of anywhere you can
Push me in through the garbage can
Teach this white boy to be Mexican
Take me
Mexican caravan
Let's score some of that heroin
You know the way to make the white boy say
Make me Mexican
Take me
Mexican caravan
Push me into the Rio Grande
Give this white boy the big sun tan
Make me Mexican
Take me
Take me
Take me
Take me, Mexican caravan!1Embed
