Woly Boly LyricsI went into the theater, I decide to whirl
I'll take a man, I'll see him again
Never seen  said, "buddy boy"
I rolled into the tonky with a marking laigh
A bigger man, but he was mean
I stole his guns, oh Billy Boy!
Ahhh!
I rolled into the tonky, don't know what to say
The bastard who took my gun was three miles away
I rolled into the tonky, don't know what to do
A beagle, a bear, the girl, the thorn
The world would see them through
I moved into the tables, they'd see the cigar
He threw my food in the boulevard
Oh Billy Boy! oh Billy Boy!
I walk into the fountain with Billy Boy
I see a thing in the Boulevard
A yellow man, a fucking boy
Walking to the center in the magazine
I see the girls, they're looking fine
Hail Mary, full of grace!
Over to the band stand and what are they saying?
The bouncers, they know who I am
I stuck it out with another man
No!Embed
