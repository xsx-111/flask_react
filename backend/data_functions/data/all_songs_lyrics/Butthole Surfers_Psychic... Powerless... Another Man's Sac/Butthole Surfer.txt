Butthole Surfer LyricsButthole surfers
Butthole surfers
Fucking surfers
Butthole surfer!

Butthole surf, wha-oh
Butthole surf, wha-oh
Butthole surf, wha-oh
Hey, butt! AAAAAH
I was walkin' down around Venice way
Los Angeles, California
A man came up to me about 40, gay
I say "Go away, okay, no way, hey"

Butthole surf, wha-oh
Butthole surf, wha-oh
Butthole surf, wha-oh
Hey, butt! AAAAAH
I was riding a wave around Malibu beach
And a guy came up to me, he was looking like a leech
He says, "Hey, Sonny boy, can I eat your peach?"
I say "Motherfucker, if you reach I don't know what I'm gonna do"
Butthole surf, wha-oh
Butthole surf, wha-oh
Butthole surf, wha-oh
Hey, butt! AAAAAH
I was riding my cruiser down in West Hollywood
And a girl came driving by and she was looking mighty good
Well, I was eating quaaludes like butthole surfers should
She left me there, right there where I stood
Butthole! Surf!
Butthole surf
Hey, butt, what the fuck
We all like you cause you're a slut!Embed
