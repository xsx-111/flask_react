Lady Sniff LyricsYeah, Bo!
Heh heh heh heh!
Lady sniff my twisted Lincoln, lady walk alone
Lately when I see you, baby, Lord I gotta go
Walking down that stinky highway, got to meet my man
Lately when I smell you, baby, oh my goddamn
Cause I says no
Yeah, I mean no
Yeah, I said no
Take me back to Detroit, Paul, yeah heh heh
Lady sniff my broken teabag, lady walk the road
Lately when I see that teabag, I can't take the load
Lady walk that greasy gravy, Lord 
Lately when I eat you baby, Lord, I just can't see
Cause I says no
Lord, I mean no
Yeah, said no
Not on you, baby
Pass me some of that dumbass over there, yeah boy
Lady walk with Furry Burry, animally in, yeah
Lately when I see you baby, got to have my sin
Lady walk that greasy highway, stinky holy war
Lately when I see you baby, walking out that door
Cause I says no
Yeah, I mean no
Whoa-ooh-oh-ooh-oh
Murray, bring me my bacon! Murray?!
Lady fold my wall to wall, know what the hell you say
Walk 'em on those roly-polys each and every day
Lady in my stinky pinky, rooty dooty do
Lately when I see you, baby, don't know what I do
I says no
Yeah, no
Yeah, no
Murray!Embed
