Dum Dum LyricsYou want the people to be the people
That want the people to love you
You need the people to show the facts
Instead again, they shove you
Want the people to be the people that
They don't need you
Need the people to show the facts
They just please you
Lover man, his face is lost
And you're much colder
Then again, the other man
He's much bolder
You need the people to be the people
That want the people to love you
You need the people to show the facts
Instead again, they shove you
Want the people to see the people that
They don't need you
Need the people to be the people that
They don't need you
Then again, that son of a bitch
And he's much colder
Then again and then again and then again and then again
You want the people to be the people
That want the people to love you
You need the people to show the facts
Instead again, they shove you
Want the people to be the people
They don't need you
Need the people to show the facts
They just bleed you
The other man, his face is lost
And you're much older
Then again, the other man
He's much bolderEmbed
