Gary Floyd LyricsI could have a real good time if I had a gun
I know, well I know, the things I'd do and say
And if I did not have no gun well I know, I know
I've got a knife (well, I've got a knife)

Well, Gary Floyd and all his pals are gonna come on down
To the roundaround. They're gonna shoot all day
Saw the nature by the swimming pool
In a two-piece oh and I lost my cool
Well I'm cool - the things I do and say, hey!
The color brown is coming down
I feel my head go round and round and round
And round and round and round and round
