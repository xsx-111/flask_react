To Parter LyricsAnd all the sailors who were junkies, all
They all went sailing out to sea
And the white man sold quaaludes to the monkeys
And they all died high up in the trees
And all the teachers who were flunkies, now
They all taught you and me
And the goddamned white men still selling quaaludes to the monkeys
And they're all, you and me, dying high up in the treesEmbed
