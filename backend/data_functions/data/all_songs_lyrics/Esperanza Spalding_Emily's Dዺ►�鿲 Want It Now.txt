I Want It Now Lyrics
I want the world...
I want the whole world

Give it to me, now!
I want it now!
I want it now!

I want today...
I want tomorrow

Give it to me, now!
I want it now!
I want it now!

I want to lock it all up in my pocket
It's my bar of chocolate
Give it to me, now!
I wanna wear it like braids in my hair
And I don't want to share it
I want a party with rooms full of laughter
Ten thousand tons of ice cream
And if I don't get the things that I'm after
I'm going to scream!
I want the works...
I want the whole works
Give it to me, now!
Presents and prizes and sweets and surprises
Of all shapes and sizes...

Don't care how, I want it now! (x4)
I want it now!1Embed
