Chequered Light Buildings LyricsChequered light buildings
Fallen from the sky
Sway as they climb into your eye
They're taller now
Everything has changed
From an empty frame
Stares a distant face
Can he see me?
At night and all alone
When I raise my hand to wave
The face is gone
Gone
In a flash I see the face is mine
And swinging from the mantelpiece is why
I said I could go back to the house where all we keep is keeping on
Where everyone pretends that they belong and long and long
If I tell you what I'm seeing
Can you tell me what is true?
In the space between our feelings
There's a place for me and you
You
There's a place for me and youEmbed
