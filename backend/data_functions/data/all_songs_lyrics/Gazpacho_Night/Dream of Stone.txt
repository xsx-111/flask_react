Dream of Stone LyricsSummer nights in windows frame the moon on your face
And when the night confines you in a desireless embrace
Then, if you don't believe it all the magic is dead
And what becomes of little boys who're lost inside their head?
Well, if you don't receive the message
Then you'll know that I have failed
The answer, in all honesty, is constantly in change
The beauty in a desert dawn, the comedy of rain
Your will is gone, dreams will erase
You're hanging on by your fingernails
Will someone bring me back again
Night never needs a reason
The arrogance of love will always know
That when you close your eyes the truth is shown and born
To fall in love is such a dream
It flies, to where it flies no one sees
The darkest stone conceals a vein of gold
Detest me when I'm running late
ItÂ´s a kiss of endings, kiss of hate
So what becomes of all of those who run away from home
Your world keeps getting bigger and you're on your own
Home to no one, you're nowhere
The sandman takes you there
You'll be sleeping on the pillow where night becomes her hair
Climbing through the button hole and falling up the stairs
So go on now, sweet prince and let me lead you on
Close your eyes to blindly look at the sun
You fall below the silver screen
Of knowledge it's a perfect dream
Rubicon's old bridges burn
You turn, they are ablaze
The great divine getting bigger
Tears sting your face
You'll be sleeping on the other side
Where a smile becomes your fear
Ladders lean against the wall
The well water is clear
Kiss it and make it better
Kiss it and make it better1Embed
