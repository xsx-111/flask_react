Upside Down LyricsYou may believe that your house is bleak and you're leaving
But there's a gulf between what it is that you see and what you should be seeing
You may believe that your house is bleak and you're leaving
But there's a gulf between what it is that you see and what you should be seeing
And you open like a flower
And I open too
I have found that what you seek
Is the perfect flower and it is in you
And I only wish you knew
The way I see it (What do you see?)
The world is upside down (Upside down?)
Is it me? (Can it be?)
Or is it in your hands?
So go on now sweet prince
And let me lead you on
And close your eyes to blindly look at the sun
You fall below the silver screen
Of knowledge, it's a perfect dream
Rubicon's old bridges burn
You turn, they are ablaze
Great divide is getting bigger
Home to no one, you are nowhere
The Sandman takes you there
You'll be sleeping on the pillow
Where the night becomes her hair
Climbing through the buttonhole
And falling up the stairs
Go on go on go on
So go on now sweet prince
And let me lead you on
Close your eyes to blindly look at the sunEmbed
