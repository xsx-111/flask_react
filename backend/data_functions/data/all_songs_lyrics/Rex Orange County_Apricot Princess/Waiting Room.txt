Waiting Room LyricsOur family reunion
I'd rather be anywhere but here
It's like a pain you shouldn't ignore
But my uncle's here to open the door and I don't like him
This family reunion
I felt so uncomfortable, I left
They all decided to stay
So it's just me and my mistakes
And I'd like to know that you smile when you're alone
And when you need time to yourself
Remember me, I won't be anyone else
I'm just the boy you love
I'm just the boy
And my lover, my best friend
When I heard that you don't know why you're here
I fell face down
And became one with the ground
And my lover's best friend
No, he doesn't know what to suggest
He does everything for love
But when his "everything" just isn't enough
He'd like to know that you smile when you're alone (Mhm, mhm)
And when you need time to yourself (Mhm, mhm)
Remember me, I won't be anyone else
I'm just the boy you love
The boy you love, ooh
And if it looks like you don't love me then
That's alright and I would let you be content
I'm still your friend
No revenge and no regrets
No regrets, no regrets
And if it looks like God might judge me
Then I don't even wanna stay another day
'Cause if he's the one, then who am I?
He calls the shots
And he always decides
Then, what's the point in living life
Living life, when it's all for him?
All for him
All for him
Ooh, oh yeah7Embed
