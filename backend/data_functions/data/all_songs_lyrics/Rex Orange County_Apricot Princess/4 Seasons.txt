4 Seasons Lyrics
Who am I to judge
The people who don't care for me
When I don't care about them either?
And who am I to judge
The friends that I once thought I knew?
They're all off doing what they wanna do
I'm falling to pieces
When I'm on my own
Even though I'm a walking emotion
And I can't go a day without you
I saw myself as less and you so high above me
But I hope that you can learn to love me

Four seasons, they've flied by
And I cry, usually in the evening
Before I calm myself and start sleeping
And I'ma sleep in, cause each weekend is like a Monday to me
She stay behind the bar at work
So I'm getting Red Bull for free
And I'm so bored of being awkward
I hit my head against a door
Oh, now she made me much less awkward
I'm not so awkward anymore
And I'm flying back to L.A.â€‹
And I can't wait for her to see
And I'm not fucking with first class
But I'd sure like a sleeper seat, so
I'll find a spot that's just for me and see if I can cope
Without an ounce of pain, without an ounce of pain
Now that you're around, I pray you don't go
And we don't even need to mention all the things that matter
Or anything you're stressing 'bout
Just tell me why your day was good
And love me after hours
Now that you're around, I pray you don't go
'Cause since you made me social, I'm no longer eating solo
I said thank you, and thanks bro
With the wet shirt in the front row
Sweat shirt that's young me playing Erykah, afro
Way back, back when I would have worn a snapback
But fuck that, fuck that
And I hate myself for what I'm 'bout to say
But I feel as if it's time to get away
I'll find a spot that's just for me and see if I can cope
Without an ounce of pain, without an ounce of pain

I said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually, things die
But if only he'd remember my name one final time
I said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually, things die
But if only he'd remember my name one final time
I said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually, things die
But if only he'd remember my name one final time
All the things that matter or anything you're stressing 'bout
Just tell me why your day was good and love me after hours
Now that you're around I pray you don't go
'Cause since you made me social, I'm no longer eating solo

Said the likelihood just frightens me and it's easier to hide
But I can't ignore it endlessly, eventually, things die
But if only he'd remember my name one final time16Embed
