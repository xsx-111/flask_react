Sycamore Girl Lyrics
I guess you got me where you want me, girl
And I'm not sure if we should slow it down (Slow down)
And I'm ashamed of the way that I've appeared
But I promise I'm not gonna let you down (Don't let me down)
By the way, I don't know how to be in love
I'm not afraid, I'm a slave right away
And I'm here for good

And there's not a day that I won't be yours
And I'm glad I'm not alone anymore
Is this too good to be true?
Can't you see I'm just a fool?
But if you have a couple hours, call me tonight

I guess I'm falling in the same way
'Cause I know after dark I will want you here (I'll be there)
I'm just like you, boy
We have so much to lose or the best to come
And by the way, it's a way that I haven't felt before
I have to say, that I feel like I've never been so sure

And there's not a day that I won't be yours
And I'm glad I'm not alone anymore
Is this too good to be true?
Can't you see I'm just a fool?
Because I need to know, I need to know
You're all I need (Won't you stay, won't you stay)
And you're all I see (Won't you stay, won't you stay)
Can't you see, all I need, never take that away from me20Embed
