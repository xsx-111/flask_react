Untitled LyricsI make enough mistakes
And it feels like she's the only one that hears the things I say
So if for any reason there's some miscommunication or I'm lying to her face
My immaturity and habits getting in the way
'Cause I can barely breathe and I don't know how I'll explain myself this time
Wish it wasn't a case of "this time"
But why can't I be any other boy
That doesn't need a hand in love?
Someone that I would trust
But how did I fail
To give you all the love that you deserve?
When you're the only thing that's worth
What life is worth
And I don't mind if you hate me
'Cause baby, if I were you, I would probably hate me too
I said that I don't mind if you hate me
'Cause baby, if I were you, I would probably hate me too28Embed
