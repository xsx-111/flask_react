Never Enough Lyrics
Now there's no one left to blame
And your face stays the same
You're ashamed to say you feel relieved
Stay away from your own family

But years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've
Achieved the things you hoped to do, but
Honestly, I don't feel ordinary 'cause I haven't been at home in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile

But that's never enough
'Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel

You see, my old lady's old man just now left
And there's nothing I can say except this long awaited rest
Is a good thing, and all good things must come to an end
It's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend
Except, I'm afraid to die
If this were a movie, you'd be taking our kids to school
And I would be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy, somebody cool
But years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've
Achieved the things you hoped to do, cause
Honestly, I don't feel ordinary 'cause I haven't left my house in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile

But that's never enough
'Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel

Don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
Well, I could be the one to help
No, don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
No, don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
No, don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
Don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
Well, I could be the one to help
Said, don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
Well, I could be the one to help11Embed
