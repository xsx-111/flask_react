Ghost Train LyricsTook the cannon ball down to the ocean
Across the desert from the sea the shining sea
I rode a ladder that climbed across the nation
50 million feet of earth between the buried and me
"How do you do?"
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"
She buys a ticket, 'cause it's cold were she comes from
She climbs aboard because she's scared
Of getting older in the snow
Love is a ghost train, rumbling through the darkness
Hold on to me, darling, I've got nowhere else to go
"How do you do?"
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"
Hey
I took the cannonball down to the ocean
Watch the diesel disappear beneath the tumbling waves
Love is a ghost train, howling on the radio
"Remember everything" she said, "Only memories remains"
"How do you do?"
She said, "Hey, how do you do?"
Hey, how do you do?
She said, "Hey, how do you do?Embed
