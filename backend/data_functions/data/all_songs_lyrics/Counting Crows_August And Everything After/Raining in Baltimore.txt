Raining in Baltimore LyricsThis circus is falling down on its knees
The big top is crumbling down
It's raining in Baltimore, fifteen miles east
Where you should be, no one's around
I need a phone call, I need a raincoat
I need a big love, I need a phone call
These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you pay for
But I just had no intention of living this way
I need a phone call, I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn, I need a raincoat
And I get no answers, and I don't get no change
It's raining in Baltimore, baby, but everything else is the same
There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you, I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?
I need a phone call, maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train, baby, if I listen real hard
And I wish, I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns
I'd like to hear a little guitar, I guess it's time to put the top down
I need a phone call, I need a raincoat
I really need a raincoat; I really, really need a raincoat
I really, really, really need a raincoat; I really need a raincoat4Embed
