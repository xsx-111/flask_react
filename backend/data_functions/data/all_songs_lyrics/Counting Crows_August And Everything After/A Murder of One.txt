A Murder of One LyricsBlue morning, blue morning
Wrapped in strands of fist and bone
Curiosity, kitten
Doesn't have to mean you're on your own
You can look outside your window
He doesn't have to know
We can talk a while, baby
We can take it nice and slow
All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream
Well, are you happy where you're sleeping?
Does he keep you safe and warm?
Does he tell you when you're sorry?
Does he tell you when you're wrong?
Well, I've been watching you for hours
It's been years since we were born
We were perfect when we started
I've been wondering where we've gone
All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream
Well, I dreamt I saw you walking
Up a hillside in the snow
Casting shadows on the winter sky
As you stood there counting crows
One for sorrow, two for joy
Three for girls, and four for boys
Five for silver, six for gold
Seven for a secret never to be told
But there's a bird that nests inside you
Sleeping underneath your skin
Yeah, when you open up your wings to speak
I wish you'd let me in
All your life is such a shame, shame, shame
All your love is just a dream, dream, dream
Open up your eyes, you can see the flames, flames, flames
Of your wasted life, you should be ashamed
Yeah, you don't want to waste your life, baby
You don't wanna waste your life now, darling
You don't wanna waste your life, baby
You don't wanna waste your life now, darling
Oh, you don't wanna waste your life now, babe
I said, you don't wanna waste your life now, darling
Oh, you don't wanna waste your life now, baby
Oh, you don't wanna
You don't wanna waste your life now, darling
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
I walk along these hillsides
In the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
I said, I walk along these hillsides
In the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
I said, I will walk along these hillsides
In the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight falling down on me
I said, I will walk along these hillsides
In the summer 'neath the sunshine
I am feathered by the moonlight
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Change, change, change
Oh, change, change, change
Oh, change, change, change
Change, change, change change
Change, change, change, change, changeEmbed
