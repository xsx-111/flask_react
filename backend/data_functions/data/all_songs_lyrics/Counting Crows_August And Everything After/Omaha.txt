Omaha LyricsStart tearing the old man down
Run past the heather and down to the old road
Start turning the grain into the ground
Roll a new leaf over
In the middle of the night
There's an old man treading around in the gathered rain
Hey, mister, if you're gonna walk on water
Could you drop a line my way?
Omaha, somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door
Start threading the needle
Brush past the shuttle that slides through the cold room
Start turning the wool across the wire
Roll the new life over
In the middle of the night
There's an old man threading his toes
Through a bucket of rain
Hey, mister, you don't wanna walk on water
'Cause you're only gonna walk all over me
Omaha, somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door
Start running the banner down
Drop past the color
Come up through the summer rain
Start turning the girl into the ground
Roll a new love over
In the middle of the day, there's a young man
Rolling around in the earth and rain
Hey mister, if you're gonna walk on water
You know you're only gonna walk all over me
Omaha, somewhere in middle America
Get right to the heart of matters
It's the heart that matters more
I think you'd better turn your ticket in
And get your money back at the door4Embed
