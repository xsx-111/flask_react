Rain King Lyrics
When I think of Heaven, deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of flying down in your sea of pens and feathers
And all other instruments of faith and sex and God
In the belly of a black-winged bird

Don't try to feed me
'Cause I've been here before
And I deserve a little more

And I belong in the service of the queen
And I belong anywhere but in between
She's been crying and I've been thinking
And I am the rain king

And I said, "Mama, mama, mama, why am I so alone"
'Cause I can't go outside, I'm scared I might not make it home
Well I'm alive, I'm alive, but I'm sinking in
If there's anyone at home at your place, darling
Why don't you invite me in?

Don't try to feed me
'Cause I've been here before
And I deserve a little more
And I belong in the service of the queen
And I belong anywhere but in between
She's been lying and I've been sinking
And I am the rain king

Hey, I only want the same as anyone
Henderson is waiting for the sun
Oh, it seems night endlessly begins and ends
After all the dreaming, I come home again

When I think of Heaven, deliver me in a black-winged bird
I think of dying, lay me down in a field of flame and heather
Render up my body into the burning heart of God
In the belly of a black-winged bird

Don't try to feed me
'Cause I've been here before
And I deserve a little more

And I belong in the service of the queen
And I belong anywhere but in between
She's been dying and I've been drinking
And I am the rain king
Well I said that "I am the rain king"
Well I said, "I, I, I, I, I, well I am the rain king", yeah5Embed
