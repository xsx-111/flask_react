Perfect Blue Buildings LyricsJust down the street from your hotel, baby
I stay at home with my disease
Ain't this position familiar, darling?
Well, all monkeys do what they see
Help me stay awake, I'm falling
Down on Virginia and La Loma
Where I got friends who'll care for me
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted
I got an attitude of need
So help me stay awake, I'm falling
Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
Gonna get me a little oblivion, baby
And try to keep myself away from me
It's 4:30 a.m. on a Tuesday
It doesn't get much worse than this
In beds in little rooms, in buildings in the middle
Of these lives which are completely meaningless
Help me stay awake, I'm falling
Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
I wanna get me a little oblivion, baby
I'm trying to keep myself away from myself and me
Well, I got bones beneath my skin, mister
There's a skeleton in every man's house
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody
There's a dead man trying to get out
So please help me stay awake, I'm falling
Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
I wanna get me a little oblivion, baby
I'm trying to keep myself away from myself and me
Asleep in perfect blue buildings
Beside the green apple sea
I wanna get me a little oblivion, baby
I'm trying to keep myself away from myself and me
Oh, in a perfect blue building
Well, I can't keep myself away from me
In a perfect blue building
So how am I gonna keep myself away?
How am I gonna keep myself away from me?
Keep myself away
How am I gonna keep myself away from me?
Keep myself away
How am I gonna keep myself away from me?3Embed
