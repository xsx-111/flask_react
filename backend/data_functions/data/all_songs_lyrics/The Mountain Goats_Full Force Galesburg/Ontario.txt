Ontario Lyrics
I know what my weaknesses are
Probably better than you do
Revolutionary Chinese propaganda
The color of blue

I thought I knew what my weaknesses were anyway
And then the orange tree blossomed last Saturday
And there was nothing in it but pain for me

I know what can hurt me real bad
And what can't hurt me anymore
I know how to rise up with the sun
And I am learning what sleep's good for

I thought I'd figured out the world in its circular way
Then I saw the sun fall out of the sky the other day
There was nothing in it but pain for me

Squirrels climbing trees in bloom
Soft yellow light spilling into the room
My favorite records
My favorite books
The people I loved
The people I almost loved
Light beckoning, wind whistling
Hey hey, hey hey
Daybreak, river rolling
Hey, hey
La la la laEmbed
