Space Lyrics
Gravity's my enemy
It grabs at me like I'm money
The stars are bangin' close to me
As I'm floatin' in a life odyssey

My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in space odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey

Like Puzzle Bobble on PC
It's got color waves following me
And I still judge it week by week
And I'm 'head of time, so you'll never lose me

My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey

Ooh, ah, ah ah
Can I take a minute or two
To introduce my point of you
I need to spend some time with you
There's nothing more new on the news

My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey
My lines are down, you can't call me
As I float around in a space odyssey2Embed
