Macho Lyrics
I mashed up a coconut outside by the back wall
Shoot my clothes on eating up my mango
Daddy was home, huntin' up the wild boar
Get your mama, quick got the polo
We had no idea we were cookin' for commando
Everybody came in 4-wheeler truckloads
Big head with players on the down low
Black coffee and fill in the info

And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

I can't have videos made by Sony, yo
Screen films of Rocky and Rambo
Role models from Hollywood to jungle
We learned to battle using our heroes
Aviator shades, no winds with the gren-ade
Hittin' that, uh camouflage and band-aid
Homemade tin weapons that ricochet
When it's hot, we all make lemonade
And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple

Picked out an idiom and got my uniform
Girl gladiator, step in the stadium
One next to chick now talkin' rebellion
Cyanide pill hangin' like medallion
Picked out an idiom and got my uniform
Girl gladiator, step in the stadium
One next to chick now talkin' rebellion
Cyanide pill hangin' like medallion

And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple
And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simple
Ooo nana Madia sani de papaiya suni de ma

And now we really rock now, we're macho
And that's what we wanted all along
Hanging up like it's the laws of our ghetto
And now we see that things are not simpleEmbed
