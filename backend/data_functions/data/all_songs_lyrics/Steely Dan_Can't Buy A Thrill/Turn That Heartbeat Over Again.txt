Turn That Heartbeat Over Again Lyrics
With stocking face I bought a gun
The plan was set, the plan was done
Looked at my watch and started for the door
Now the food here ain't so good no more
And they closed the package store
Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
My poison's named, you know my brand
So please make mine a double, Sam
Stir it up nice, I'll eat it right here
Yeah, this highway runs from Paraguay
And I've just come all the way
Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me

Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again

We warned the corpse of William Wright
Not to cuss and drink all night
Ticket in hand, we saw him laid to rest
Woah, but zombie see and zombie do
He's here with me and you

Love your mama, love your brother
Love 'em till they run for cover
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on
Cry a jag on me
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
You know I'm not to blame
You know my reputation
For playing a good clean game
Oh Michael, oh Jesus
I'll keep my promise when
You turn that heartbeat over again
Turn that heartbeat over again1Embed
