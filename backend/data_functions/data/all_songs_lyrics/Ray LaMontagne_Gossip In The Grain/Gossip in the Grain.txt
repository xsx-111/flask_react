Gossip in the Grain LyricsSuch the lazy Jackstraw
Always late for tea
Never bothers to ring lately
Says the silly Sparrow
'There's gossip in the grain
Have you heard the...Oh you don't say.'
'Someday
Someday
A snow shall fill the trees
You'd best make warm the eves.'
Callous is the old Crow
He'd mock even the sun
Eyes as black as blood
Bone crack in the craw
He'd say
He'd say
Always a 'Never mind'
Always a 'Never mind'
Truth be:
Beggar that holds his tongue
Dines on none, none but air aloneEmbed
