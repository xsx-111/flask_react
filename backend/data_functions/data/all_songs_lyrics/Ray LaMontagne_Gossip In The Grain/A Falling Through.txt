A Falling Through LyricsLaid our blessings on the ground
The softening of sound
Draws us closed again
Stay, stay and watch the coals
Till they cease to glow
Like empty promises
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Baby?
There's nothing I can say
Nothing I can do
To bring you back again
This of life I know is true
It's all a falling through
And so I reach for you
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Don't you care
That it may seem unfair?
(You steal things you ought to borrow)
Don't you find
That it may seem unkind?
(I'd rather breathe than drown in sorrow)
Why, why did you go
Why did you go away baby
Why, why did you go
Why did you go away babyEmbed
