Sarah LyricsWhen we first met we were kids
We were wild, we were restless
After a while, I grew coarse
I grew cold, I grew reckless
I hold this memory
I've pulled you so close to me
Whispered "will we always have this?"
Lately it feels like I'm sleeping
And I just can't wake up
Pacing the floor, want to call, but I can't
So I hang up
Sharing a seat on the train
With a lady who's crying
Has ruined her make up
Now I see just how young, how scared I was
My eyes closed tight, throwing punch after punch
At the world
Sarah, is it ever gonna be the same?
Sarah, is it ever gonna be the same?
Said goodbye to all the places I used to go
I said goodbye to all the faces I used to know
Nothing lasts forever
I guess by now I should know
I should know
There ain't a thing I can say
That will ever repair it
And you who had so much advice
And yet couldn't share
Maybe someday we will look back
On this and we'll smile
But right now I can't bear it
Now I see just how young, how scared I was
Eyes closed tight, throwing punch after punch
At the world
Sarah, is it ever gonna be the same?
Sarah, is it ever gonna be the same?1Embed
