Roses and Cigarettes LyricsPlastered in your newspaper palace
Dishes and the backdoor slams
The dogs on the floor
They don't roam anymore
And the rivers gone deaf at the dam
The dust falls like rain on your doorsteps
Chokes you when you lift your rake
A wine so sweet is the taste of your mouth
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Oh roses and cigarettes
Pillow case that remembers you
The scent of you still lingers on my fingertips
Till I think I might go insane
When will I see you again
Seen how you look at the stranger
I see how you wait when he's gone
If I told you I thought that there was a sin in your heart
Could you honestly tell me I'm wrong
Oh roses and cigarettes
Pillowcase that remembers you
The scent of you still lingers on my fingertips
Till I think I might go insane
When will I see you again
He tells you that he needs you, he's a liar
He tells you he's a hero, he's a fool
He tells you he'll stay till the lords breaking day
Then babe he ain't nothing but cruel
Oh roses and cigarettes
Pillowcase that remembers you
The scent of you still lingers on my fingertips
Till I think I might go insane
When will I see you againEmbed
