I Still Care For You Lyrics
Hear me out, day follows today
Light turns to clay in my hands
How to explain so pristine the pain
Kindness made the cut so clean

I still care for you
I still care for you
I still care for you

Hear me out, you wanted me to be
Less your lover than a mirror
Can't you see what you mean to me?
Even promises may bleed

I still care for you
I still care for you
I still care for you

The hours grow heavy and hollow
Cruel as a grave
Open me and you'll find
Only bones burned to glass
I still care for you
I still care for you
I still care for you1Embed
