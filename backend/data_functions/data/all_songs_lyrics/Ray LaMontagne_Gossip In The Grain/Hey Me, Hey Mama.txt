Hey Me, Hey Mama Lyrics
1.. 2.. 3.. 4..

Papa's in the kitchen, mama's in the field
Murder in the hen house, mud flung high upon the wheels
Rooster in the dooryard just leaning on the horn
Wind so sweetly drifting through the ripening corn

Hey me, hey mama
Where you been for so long, for so long?
Hey me, hey mama
Where you been, where you been for so long?

There's something outrageous 'bout that evening sky
This side of dangerous that look in your eye
Always knew that you were crazy, always knew you could be cruel
Still I would do just about anything in the world for you

Hey me, hey mama
Where you been for so long, for so long?
Hey me, hey mama
Where you been, where you been for so long?
Left me standing in the corner with my head so hanging down
Punch drunk, busted up and reeling like a rodeo clown
Always seem to hit me like a lightning from above
Guess I just wasn't ready for such a heavy handed love

Hey me, hey mama
Where you been for so long, for so long?
Hey me, hey mama
Where you been, where you been for so long?
Hey me, hey mama
Where you been for so long, for so long?

Hey me, hey mama
Where you been, where you been for so long?
Hey me, hey mama
Where you been, where you been for so long?1Embed
