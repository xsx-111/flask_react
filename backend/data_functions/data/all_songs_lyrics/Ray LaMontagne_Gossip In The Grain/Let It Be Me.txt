Let It Be Me Lyrics
There comes a time
A time in everyone's life
When nothing seems to go your way
Where nothing seems to turn out right
There may come a time
You just can't seem to find your place
And for every door you open
Seems like you get two slammed in your face

That's when you need someone
Someone that you, you can call
When all your faith is gone
It feels like you can't go on

Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend you need
Let it be me
Let it be me

When it feels like you're always comin' up last
Pockets full of nothin' ain't got no cash
No matter where you turn
You ain't got no place to stand
You reach out for something and they slap your hand
I remember all too well
Just how it feels to be all alone
To feel like you'd give anything
For just a little place you can call your own

That's when you need someone
Someone that you can call
When all your faith is gone
And it feels like you can't go on

Let it be me
Let it be me
If it's a friend you need
Let it be me
Let it be meEmbed
