You Are The Best Thing Lyrics
Baby
It's been a long day, baby
Things ain't been going my way
You know I need you here
To clear my mind
All the time
And baby
The way you move me, it's crazy
It's like you see right through me and make it easier
And believe me, you don't even have to try
Oh, because

You are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
That ever happened to me

Baby
We've come a long way
Baby
You know I hope and I pray that you believe me
When I say this love will never fade away
Oh, because
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
That ever happened to me

Both of us have know love before
To come on up promising like the spring, to walk on out the door
Our hearts are strong and our hearts are kind
Let me tell you just exactly what is on my mind

You are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
That ever happened to me
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
You are the best thing
That ever happened to me
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now, now, now, now2Embed
