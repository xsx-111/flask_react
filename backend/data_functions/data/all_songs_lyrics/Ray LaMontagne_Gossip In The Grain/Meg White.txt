Meg White LyricsMeg White
You're alright
In fact I think
You're pretty swell
Can't you tell?
Meg White
Such a pretty thing
I saw your face on the cover
Of a magazine
Someday
I'd like
To take a walk with you
Maybe ride our
Bikes down by the
Seaside
Meg White
Saw you on the big screen
Oh Jack was king
But you stole the scene
Meg White
Baby, you're the bomb
Oh Jack is great
Don't get me wrong
But this is your song
Someday
I'd like
To take a walk with you
And talk about most anything
You'd like to talk about
And watch the sun going down
Going down
Playin' those drums
Is hard to do
It's true
And nobody plays them
Quite like you do
Meg White
You're alright
In fact I think
You're pretty swell
Can't you tell?
Meg White
Such a pretty thing
Saw your face on
The cover of a
Magazine
Someday
I'd like
To take a walk with you
Maybe ride our
Bikes down by the
Seaside
And watch the sun going down
Going down
Going down
Going downEmbed
