Dear Lord Lyrics
He has no eyes, though He sees
He has no ears, though He hears
He remembers everything with the aid of mind and memory
When He wishes to create a thing, He just orders it to be and it comes into existence
For this order is not conveyed in words which takes a tongue to follow or a sound carries ears
He hears the secrets of those in their quiet thoughts
He's my bodyguard, he’s your bodyguard, nobody else...

Plant Your seed inside my heart
Make me bloom again
Water me, my darkest part is
To make me whole again

Uh, yeah
Dear Lord, I had a dream everyone was one religion
By the year 2020, nobody was a Christian
Nobody was a Muslim, a Catholic or a Buddhist
Nobody was Atheist or a Judas
But everyone on Earth heard God spoke and everybody listened
And everyone knew it was one world that we lived in
We saw ourselves in each other but also knew the difference
So we joined hands in repentance for humanity
And everyone agreed we are a family
We agreed to stop eating meat and ban all brutality
We destroyed every gun ever made from the face of the Earth
And we dissembled every bomb ever made to save Earth
From any further destruction and corruption and we went into production
Producing everything we ever wanted
I dream the world had a harvest that cured global starvation
In a year's time we are declared one nation
One word, one man in the new life cycle
On a mission to outlive dinosaurs and the oldest man in the Bible
We made it from the days of survival to living free
Living free, being me, a human being
I dream that we made Truth king and his wife was Love
And my future was made clear as the skies above
Man fix every mistake that He ever made
And made every move to make the moves that he never made
To be a twenty-foot giant by the year 3000
Eating strictly vegetables and vitamins, exercising
We made world history the new word of God
And we changed the world with a song and it's called "Dear Lord"
Plant Your seed inside my heart
So I can bloom again
Water me, my darkest part is
Who can make me whole again?
Dear Lord, dear Lord
Can’t You hear me crying out?
Dear Lord, dear LordEmbed
