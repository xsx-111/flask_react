To the Fall, But Not Forgotten Lyrics
Sobre la cuestión
Acerca de si, eh, la lucha armada
Es el único camino
Para la liberación

Fidel Castro passed, yo
And Nelson Mandela was the last savior for Black folks
Don't know what I would be without Muhammad Ali
And the best rapper alive, that would be Sean P
We seen the true leader through Afeni Shakur
And Phife Dawg, we don't wanna lose any more
I'm sure Prince will be missed as the years pass
And David Bowie had the homies crying tear gas
Rest in peace to a G named Kimbo Slice
Even Bill Nunn, man, I wish I could save his life
I was just thinking 'bout Gene Wilder
And you know Anthony Mason, you know he had the power
My nigga Tom Ford, you even held it down
Like how Sharon Jones shared that golden sound
Guru, can you still see me from above the clouds?
Tell Eyedea teach the people how to freestyle
Big love, shout out to Bobbi Kristina Brown
Mr. Spock needs a spacecraft, not a stone in the ground
Natalie Cole, Ms. Nat Queen Cole
B.B. King sing the blues but had so much soul
And Bobby "Blue" Bland was a true bluesman
Rubin "Hurricane" Carter taught us how to take a stand
Ornette Coleman never put down his horn
Amiri Baraka knew exactly what we was on
Amy Winehouse had the perfect sound for the wind down
And Maya Angelou, why did you have to go?
Rodney King, you know we really need you now
Tamir Rice, Freddie Grey, Trayvon, Michael Brown
Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, even Amadou Diallo
Ezell Ford and other victims that follow
Philip Seymour Hoffman, Paul Walker
Robin Williams, y'all, we gotta try harder
Michael Jackson, you know you'll never leave this planet
Unless you figure out how Neil Armstrong landed
Every time I see Will, I see Uncle Phil
Bernie Mac, I know not a comedian, more real
Steve Jobs, geez, you even gave me a job
Lee Thompson Young, it's hard for me to see the prob
Gary Coleman had a lot of soul, man
Rich Nichols was the roots of The Roots whole band
And Gil Scott-Heron said it wouldn't be televised
Whitney Houston and Aaliyah kept the soul alive
And A$AP Yams was the motherfuckin' man
Capital Steez, you made me believe
Daddy Mack won't be the same without Mac Daddy
I can still see Pimp C in a pimped out caddy
Baatin, whatever happened to my man
J Dilla, there will never be another iller
More than 100 proof to the rapper Proof
What could MCs breed without MC Breed?
And MCA from the Beastie Boys
Freaky Tah from the Lost Boyz used to bring the noise
Tell Trouble T Roy that we still reminisce
Heavy D, Heavy D we can never forget
Buff Love from The Fat Boys had a lot to say
And Jam Master Jay taught you how to walk this way
O.D.B. from Wu-Tang was the true Osiris
And respect the slang tongue from the outsiders
Camu Tao, the grim reaper poetic
Nate Dogg, everybody had Nate Dogg bless it
Which brings me to the greatest of all, 2Pac
But KRS One would say Scott La Rock
Biggie Smalls the most notorious of all
Big L was my favorite MC, bar for bar
Big Pun, you know that his job wasn't done
Eazy-E, definition of a true OG
Charizma and Ill Will both had a story
And anyone else who didn't receive glory
Malcom X, Dr. King, Jimi Hendrix, Huey P
Jean-Michel Basquiat, John Lennon, and Abe Linc
I pray that we all get to share longevity
And tell Dr. Sebi niggas still wasn't ready
Ay, yo1Embed
