Blue Lyrics
Red, green, blue, yellow
Red, green (She fell into the)

(Blue) I said U-L-B
Like L Boog but more hood like Ice-T
And that's cool like Miles Davis walked in the room
And redefined the groove to find jazz
The mood turned (Blue) like the note I wrote
To the boat I float with no ledge so know the ledge
Knowledge and longevity, loyalty and leadership
Don't let that long list get you (Blue)
Like Portishead's album cover picture
A top shelf like Blue Label liquor
I'm just a lightskin nigga, my nigga
I don't see the glass half full, I see the whole pitcher
(Blue) Am I blue like the late of your blues
Or like B.B. King and Muddy Waters singin' the blues?
Billie Jean in blue jeans singin' the blues
Or like anything for the youth who singin' the blues? (Blue)
Not right like Langston Hughes
Every album out pourin' out the gangster blues
Abraham Lincoln in that navy blue
Don't let that long arm of justice paint you blue
For the Native in American and African American man
We all can stand together like the colors of the flag
So the man of the land is the man of the nation
Same colors came together to begin creation (Red)
Red rock, white smoke
Blue ocean, overflow (Yellow)
Heard Y2K got your third eye open
So it might go pop but it's not finna blow
(Blue) Like A-Bombs on Pearl Harbor
Or like the color of gold on the martyr
Or like a mother who was told her heart was harder
Jay-Z named his daughter
Andre the Giant, Bob Vince Gilligan
KRS and Snoop got both coasts chillin' in
The big blue Buick with the bass everlastin'
She can't stop askin', imagine your face turns (Red)
From what you read in the magazine
Bad dreams leave green (Green)
Blue, Kool G, Ill Street ghetto (Yellow)
Don't call me yellow, yo, tell my mellow
I'm (Blu) Best Lyricist Underground
Buildin' understandin' now how that sound?
I asked my mom, "How you spell John?"
God bless you, believe you, B-L-U
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-doEmbed
