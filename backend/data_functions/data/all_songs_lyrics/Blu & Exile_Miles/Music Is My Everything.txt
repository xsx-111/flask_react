Music Is My Everything Lyrics
Where everything is music, don't worry about saving these songs
And if one of our instruments breaks, it doesn't matter
We have fallen into the place where everything is music
The strumming and flute notes rise into the atmosphere
And even if the whole world's harp should burn up
There will be hidden instruments playing

Uh, see I can't explain how it hit me
But from the beginning it stained my memory
I seen the fat boys beat boxing and talking rhythmically
When I was three or four, but it came out when I was born
I remember one Sunday morn, seeing Michael Jackson perform
They tried to dress me like him next morning before I went to school
Nobody noticed me, but I still thought I was cool
That all started with Michael Jackson, I can't describe the attraction
But my dad gave me LL's Bad before I had Michael Jackson's
My papa was giving me rap back then
Now he got the nerve to act surprise that I rap
My favorite track back then was Wild Wild West
How You Like Me Now and Bad was my first two cassettes
I remember seeing Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. when I was ten
I thought he looked like Superman, so I popped it in
I skipped around, uh, I took it out, word up
I was too young to know what that was about
'Cause it was all about Oochie Coochie by MC Brains
My papa bang MC Breed, I thought they was the same thing
I remember one afternoon, my mama slapped me with a spoon
For saying I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
Still it wasn't cool when she went and married a reverend
And he told me all secular music is off limits, I said
Can you hear the sound of the music playing
I'm just trying to find the words to sing along
This music is my home
It's what keeps me going on

My cousin wrote a rap, we had a dance to it
We dissed Kris Kross but wore our pants like him
Sing in the choir since we was like five or six
Had mad baseball cards, so my cousin picked up the drumsticks
We heard the Fugees, "You Killing Me Softly"
He explained to me what a bass line was
And then we started bossing
The first beat we rocked was a Whitney Houston instrumental
No wonder we would get into Bone
Memories of Eazy-E when I was three
My auntie dated him, my papa would bang him on the way to the beach
In the middle of the street, banging in his Jeep
Playing me Chronic before the radios rocked it
So I was geeked when I heard it getting spin
And they turned it to Juice and Gin and nothing's ever been the same since
Many folks came and went but the legends remain embedded into my brain, and

Can you hear the sound of the music playing
I'm just trying to find the words to sing along
This music is my home
It's what keeps me going on
Look, uh, Who knew?
Before I seen the break and move and sing to it
Mama used to sit me on the sink while she swing to it
Church ladies fall across the pews while they preach to it
They was focused on the cross, but I just watched the keys moving
Feet moving, each movement speaking to the beastly humans
Stricken by crescendos, then at peace as soon as keys soothing
Now how it fill up any room but you can see through it?
It vibrates in any space, don't need to treat acoustics
I used to bang it in my room and sketch my pieces to it
Keep it in my mental on repeat then hit the streets to it
Ain't no coinkydink, I soon would link with E and Blu then
Proud of that, Below the Heavens was that key influence
Before that, the Wu and uncle Snoop was speaking to him
Rewind back when Eric B was in my speakers booming
All along the art was teaching emcees the meaning to it
That's why the crowd move, I eat sleep and breathe this music

Can you hear the sound of the music playing
I'm just trying to find the words to sing along
This music is my home
It's what keeps me going onEmbed
