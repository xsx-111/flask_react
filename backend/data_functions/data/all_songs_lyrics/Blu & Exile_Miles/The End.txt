The End Lyrics
And it will be the end
I'm warning all
(Hell no, we won't go)
And it will be the end
And if the blind lead the blind
All are going into the ditch

This is Martin on the balcony
This is Malcolm giving a speech at the Audubon
Shot down by his own faculty
This is Marvin shot by his own family
This is Lee Morgan shot by his girlfriend, this is the end
This is when shit gets intense
Yo, this is when shit hits the fan
This is when Al-Qaeda slash an airplane into the pentagon
This is Jimi's sleeping remedy gone wrong
This is 2Pac in Vegas, this is Biggie Smalls back in Cali
This a junkie 'bout to take his last hit in an alley
This the grand finale, my man, this is the last stand
Belmont door parallel four with the gas cans
Slaves jumping off of slave boats into the ocean
This is O.D.B. overdosing
This is Kurt Cobain loading a shotgun
Blowing his brains all over Washington
This is the slaughter, son, this is the end
This is the last draw at war
This is the last door, the one thing you don't ask God for
This is the meteor that killed all the dinosaurs
This is not the final four, nah, this is the end
Yeah, beginning and ending, I come to bless your dome
Heads get blown, send rappers to convalescent homes
Each word of my lyrics should just be etched in stone
Langston Hughes in the spirit when I express the poem
The provolone, the cheese, gouda, the Fetty guapa
I get even with vegans, nigga, and shit a Whopper
They raise a gun to their people but never hear the copper
Seek fortress from evil before I shit with chakras
My philosophy is iller than Socrates
On point like isosceles with verbal atrocities
You operate sloppily, we murder your mockery
It's Dag Sav prophecy, we shit on your comedy, ah!
Alpha and Omega, arm, leg, a leg
A arm, head sector on a slave ship to Mecca
Treat the booth like it's the house of the Lord
Why are there still so many rappers? I got thousands more

Last days when a nuclear cloud pours acid rain
From the neocon policies gone insane
When the black lungs collapse and the black rivers drain
And you don't wanna burn so you put a bullet in your brain instead
The same thing that Revelations explained, last days
When the highways collapse, this ain't the final four
This is a rap about how it's a rap about
The last time we wrapped around the corner 'fore the route expires
Either drowning in the flood or you're doused in fire
You could climb a mountain and hide in a cave
But everywhere will burn, my G, there's no escape
Apocalypse means the unveiling of the fate
When you reject God's word and give the Devil your embrace
When every layer is betrayer, every level gets erased
Last days for the ghettos and the upper-class communities
Irony through the death, the classes finally found unity
Hiding underground where they probably found you and me
Huddled in the corner, even the coroner will die off
Ain't no amount of money to prevent it, ain't no buy-off
The last days, end of watch, God turn the light off
This is osmosis, broke minds bide in hypnosis
Live streams that divide king's eyes from divine focus
You was dead in the delivery room, it's all hopeless
'Cause your heartbeat ain't in tune with the universe
The flesh is a tomb, the mind is a tool
The heart is the part where revolutions push the body to move
You ready to lose? Got the mathematics confused
If you're trending on the 'Gram, niggas are rocking my news
Ooh, what a deep truth, they don't see the bleak proof
You ignore the wisdom when you're thinking with a sweet tooth
Power is warm but cadavers is cool
Babies walk the green mile just to make it to school
What can you do? The needle stay stuck in the groove
Why you praying for a god when you fucking a fool?
D.O.A., stillborn, show me what to build on
It can't be the ground that my people getting killed on
Black lives get shattered 'cause they don't matter
Bodies full of bones for the prisons to be built on
We in the last days, trapped in a black haze
Freedom is the sacred ground we never got to live on

Skinny legs, big belly, preaching you to stand strong
Short life but think twice, it's starting to feel mad long
If this is the end, I'll take my mask off
Missile's like, "Count me down, 8, 9, 10, we have blast-off"
The end of the line is the beginning
So what's next? Once failed, just stay strong for the winning
First diversion in the sinning
I'm tryna be the last days with a bat in the ninth inning
This cat past his ninth life, the end
Holding my wife but then I get hit twice in a knife fight
I see the middle of the night coming with fright
We all gotta fight and unite for what's right
A see a version of it like, we try to unite
We get in one place for the cops to say, "Goodnight"
They pull the guns and they shoot but they bulletproof
We hit back, it don't work, they kill another two
So what you gonna do? Mad, you blast back with two rounds
But you only put one to the ground
You hear a sound, you go to the ground, you look up
A mushroom cloud hit the earth, ch-ch-blaow
Well I'm the last man on the planet
And I know because I walked to Japan
All the way from Los Angeles
I swam across the Atlantic
And it's true, I really am the last man standing
I panicked at first, then I said, "Wait, I'ma make this work"
Then I started walking the whole Earth
Then I started thinking, "What if I'm just dreaming?
What if I pinch myself and find out I'm just sleeping?"
So I closed my eyes and when I opened them
I seen people dying from opium, kids starving in Ethiopia
I seen Muslims go to war with Christians
I seen slavery lynches, I seen shit I can't even mention
I seen a man convince a population to drink his juice
I seen Bishop die at the end of Juice
I seen Jews face the Holocaust
I seen who Gs pour out their 40-ounce bottle for
I done seen shit I don't know how to describe
I played Scarface, I never seen a man cry
'Til I seen a man die, I think I seen the face of the Anti
That's why I got baptized, I seen the fate of bad guys
The faith of the rabbi, the kings of nations lie
Maybe I'm tripping, maybe I won't get shot if I'm Cripping
Maybe I smoke rocks and won't get addicted
Maybe I'm on a mission, maybe I don't know how I'ma end it
Or maybe this is how I end it, this is the end

The end of their power and their authority to rule
Hell no, we won't go
Hell no, we won't go
Hell no, we won't go
Hell no, we won't go
Hell no, we won't go
Hell no, we won't go
Hell no, we won't go
Hell no, we won't goEmbed
