African Dream Lyrics
Hmm, ayy, ayy, hmm
I'm going home when my time come
Same place weh di River Nile run
Green grass, blue skies and sun
Heart a beat like an African drum

Ayo, I'm African, although I was born in Los Angeles
I gotta get a tat to represent where my family is
Get, it's black skin, black bones, black man
From the black planet, black sand, black lamb
Back then I woulda been on a ship eating fish
Taking weekend trips in the sea to see if I could meet the French
Speaking tongues over drums, dancing and singing songs
You could see the long, all mother brothers we call
Organ, African, I'm back again
Like I never left, never did, heaven is Africa
I have to show my kids just how old the culture is
From California, but I wanna live in Africa

Oh, Africa, oh, Africa
Oh, Africa, my motherland

Ayy, hmm
I'm going home when my time come
Same place weh di River Nile run
Green grass, blue skies and sun
Heart a beat like an African drum
Oh Africa, mother Africa, home of civilization
A cradle of mankind, a birthplace of creation
Generated from stories, integrated through generations
Told by the ancients, you can't say it's none greatest
Africa, the reign of Egypt, range of my people
Disperse through the Earth surface before you could purchase vehicles
They greet you on the coast in the boat
You can't believe it, yo, it floats?
And you niggas make weapons outta stone?
Fuck, you built my homes out the stone too
And a statue of me 'cause I wanna be a king too, shoot
We could be buddies, we could trade agriculture and riches from different shores
But if you ever cross me, then we would go to war
You know the Lord Savior Creator
He made His humble specially when the Romans tried to take over the jungles
So we stopped in the Middle East, we still can't get no peace
Soon as they see a diamond, they wanna slave us for a piece of Africa

Hmm, ayy, ayy, hmm
I'm going home when my time come
Same place weh di River Nile run
Green grass, blue skies and sun
Heart a beat like an African drum
They call me the homo habilis 'cause I created the habitat
Before the great homo erectus invaded half the map
He would catch a lion, kill it,  and put his head on a stick
Just to prove to everyone how strong he really is
You can say he lives on the most nurturing continent
The fruits and vegetables, long rivers, tall mountains
Zebras, cheetahs, elephants, panthers, gorillas
The vast deserts, hot summers, cold winters
Man, the sister brought me back to my genes, African Eve had to teach the mother of agriculture a couple things
Like we could speak English, European, Chinese
And my continent is the second largest you ever seen
Red, black, yellow and green
Land man, sun in the trees, the first kings, the first human beings
The first everything, afros, cornrows, bald heads and long dreads
All said they were all bred in Africa

Oh, Africa, oh, Africa
Oh, Africa, my motherland
Oh, Africa, oh, Africa
Oh, Africa, we plan to stand

Hmm, ayy, ayy, hmm
I'm going home when my time come
Same place weh di River Nile run
Green grass, blue skies and sun
Heart a beat like an African drum
Heart a beat, heart a beat
Heart a beat like an African drum
Heart a beat, heart a beat
Heart a beat like an African drum

Oh, Africa, oh, Africa
Oh, Africa, my motherland
Oh, Africa, oh, Africa
Oh, Africa, we plan to standEmbed
