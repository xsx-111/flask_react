The American Dream Lyrics
Yeah
Know you know
Uh-huh, uh, check it

This the whole world, they say it's my world
I want the American Dream, I want a blonde girl
I just want a mansion and a yacht
I wanna make it to the top of the hill and I wanna stay real
All I want is like 88 mill'
That I could flip into at least eight bills, straight skills
Pay bills and taxes, I wanna have mad kids
And I want all my kids to have mad kids
I want the masses to say my album is a classic
And I want all my albums to go Platinum
I wanna stop rapping and start acting, put out movies, uh
And let my kids get into fashion
All I want is the American pie
You know, a big fat slice of that American lie
Same dream they sold that made America fly
Into the sky, to the moon, back to Houston, bullshit

I can't sleep, my mind's catching up to me
Dreams keeping me awake (You'll see everything's in order, know you know)
I can't sleep, my dream's catching up to me
Lose sleep, leave me awake (You'll see everything's in order you know)
I can't sleep, my mind's catching up to me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Dreams keeping me awake (Ooh-ooh, you'll see everything, I know what you want)
Is everything that you've got
'Cause by now, everyone knows I ain't had a lot
Coming up, it was rough, rusty pans and pots
So as a young man, I demanded it all
It's a house in a car
Plus another house just so I can house this broad
Plus another car that can go really, really far
And a ticket outer space after they land on Mars
Is the Slauson Mall
You know, a place where all my grandsons can shop and ball
I need a brand new shirt, new watch and shoes
For all my brothers and cousins, uncles and nephews
Is a private island for refuge
And a studio space with like 16 rooms
For all kind of our artists that be recording and rehearsing
And my own record company to put out the recordings
Uh, is a gang of more money
I wanna house the homeless, I wanna feed the hungry
I wanna cure diseases, I wanna stop brutality
I wanna pay for the best education for my family

I can't sleep, my mind's catching up to me
Dreams keeping me awake (You'll see everything's in order, know you know)
I can't sleep, my dream's catching up to me
Lose sleep, leave me awake (You'll see everything's in order you know)
I can't sleep, my mind's catching up to me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Dreams keeping me awake (Ooh-ooh, you'll see everything's in order, know you know)
I can't sleep, my dream's catching up to me
Lose sleep, leave me awake (You'll see everything, I know what you want)
Is to live forever
And not just me, but me and my family altogether
Go to church more, pick up the Bible, read a verse more
Live up to my idols, show em I'm worth more for sure
Is more money than Trump
Plus a private jet so I can fly wherever I want
Plus enough money to put all my family members in school
And pay they rent and stay legit 'cause I'm cool
All I want is to make my own rules
That way all the other states can get high too
And tell the immigrants ride through whenever they want
Global citizenship, bitch, fuck Trump
All I want is us to stop eating meat
Vegetation makes you stronger and the cipher complete
All I want is all the best things for all human beings
I just wanna be G-O-D

I see it clearly when I close my eyes

I can't sleep, my mind's catching up to me
Dreams keeping me awake (You'll see everything's in order, know you know)
I can't sleep, my dream's catching up to me
Lose sleep, leave me awake (You'll see everything's in order you know)
I can't sleep, my mind's catching up to me (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Dreams keeping me awake (Ooh-ooh, you'll see everything's in order, know you know)
And now, why talk about this?
Is it interesting, is it important?
For the human being to realize that in some sense of the word, whatever it means
He is God or one with God2Embed
