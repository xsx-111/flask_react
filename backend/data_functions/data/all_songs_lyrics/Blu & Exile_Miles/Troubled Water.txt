Troubled Water Lyrics
Live and direct in a living color
The revolution will be televized
And all who doubt it will show respect
And all wise words will be memorized
Blazing, blazing fire
Calculated and standing tall
Blazing, blazing fire
If I fall

Wash up your body, time to shine and glisten
Grind illest, yo I was slipping
I'm divine by design, we kick rhymes from the mind’s prison
Vibe, listen, kick back, chill, get in the mood again
The music is the uniting force, you feel the grooves
We spinning riddims and rhythms, really ripping the shit we kicking
My nigga this isn't a gimmick, this is the real shit, feel it
Leave it to critics to catch feelings, raps collapse buildings
When I rap, I got the blueprint map for billions
Maximillion, back to back brilliance
Word to uncle Willy, I'm silly as Saul Williams
Killing ’em whether millies or the semi automatic
Cats is bout to catch it, you could bat with a Ted Williams average
And I got a cat, duck and pitch, pass it and spit a classic
I'm finna clap it if he don't have it by the time he rap or
You can sign to the fine line backwards
Shit won't matter, shit go platinum, there go half your talent
You never battled, you are not a rapper, you can't even get it back
You just wack and wish you had your man's manager
You need a band and a helping hand and a grant after you rap
And as soon as you land, you got a plan, Blu got a ton of 'em
Ideas, concepts, and hookups
You rubbing me the wrong way if my DJ ain't cutting a hook up
Fuck do you see when you look up me?
B-L-U and you can add the E, Exi-L-E, word up
Live and direct in a living color
The revolution will be televized
And all who doubt it will show respect
And all wise words will be memorized
Blazing, blazing fire
Calculated and standing tall
Blazing, blazing fire
If I fall

I wanna paint a picture, make a difference
Change the system, make a statement
Life is so amazing, even begging for a penny, many never make it
Let alone still live at home, I can’t get out my basement
Banging speakers, blaze the reefer
We just speak a language you bob your head to and listen
And listen, this is religion, praise God, he got some rhythm
Hit ’em with the knowledge, wisdom understanding freedom
Power equal God, build destroy, born cyphers
Now look what we got, peace brother, just some justice
To be busting back at a motherfucker who never gave you nothing
They just expected us to take they shit
I say they wanted to be blunt and couldn't take the hit
I’m getting something from this journey
Send me out to sea and you can burn me
You can turn on me, put your burner on me
And I won't be nothing but a burned CD
Bumping inside someone's head
Humming my lyrics with a little kid up in their stomach
Ready to teach him to be something son, you could be a lyricist
You serious or you just be fronting, huh?
I'm busting spiritual lyrics, miraculous like a magic trick
Rabbits flip out my hat, I get action
Pinning my life is passion, get on the mic and smash it
Flipping it like Mike Jackson on the ass again
I’m still black, I peel caps and spill raps like chill black
A ill cat don't get me contagious, just know
Saving a nation, fruits of my labor made back in the slaves again
I master the craft then master the record, I bust, you masturbate
The master ain't the master if he get blasted away
I'm moving backwards to the east again
Eating apples, fucking with Eve again
Get it even 'cause evil men can never have true happiness anyway
Live and direct in a living color
The revolution will be televised
And all who doubt it will show respect
And all wise words will be memorized

So-so-so listen close to what I say"
We make waves, causing tsunamis to your armies, splash-
Everybody in here (Listen close)
M-M-M-My flow is like the o-ocean

The congress of the United States versus the city of Compton
Think how to be great versus how to escape nonsense
Constant gunshot, drugs by Johnson & Johnson
Get it higher, my grandma's attic with a bunch of addicts
Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon
I knew I was heavy-handed, didn't know I'd crack his skull
Pass the ball to the kid with too many problems
'Cause he play the hardest and stay the longest
When we at the park, I spark the long stick
And watch my problems blow out the window
Play that instrumental back to back and let me rap
I got some shit to get up off of my back
Step back and put on the track
Lay down the raps to the wax like that
Now wind it back, this the crack for them kids that don't do that
You know you wack if you can't play your tracks after my track
I'm after stacks, black, I got your respect, I got your back
I'm from the West yes, God bless the best, the beat just that right and exact
Fight titans like Tyson, biting my track
M. Bison's sliding attack, tied as tight as the raps, uh
Black man versus the Ku Klux Klan
With no gat, just two hands, but we ain't going back to that again
So-so-so listen close to what I say
We make waves, causing tsunamis to your armies, splash-
Everybody in here (Listen close)
This ship sink nigga, I'm gon' walk on water
If I fallEmbed
