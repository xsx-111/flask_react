Requiem of Blue Lyrics
Ayo, '83, LA and me, just Shay and me, just Jay and me
My grandma used to stay with me, my grandpa used to pray for me
Lord, I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep
That if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take, uh
I always thought that was bold to say
'Til one day my cousin Marty taught me how to hold a K
Smoking Js, stolen Js, growing hood, throwing trays
No one knew little Trey would make it out the Js
Made it out the city, never made it out to Egypt
But I probably take you with me if you ride to Vegas with me
Crush the luxe lush, do a deluxe luxury suite
Roast a duck on the bed by my feet, fuck off the street
Can't talk, roll the leaf, hash, shisha, blow the tree
Super 60 billion miles off of feet and touch the beat like a G
Got a dream for every word on the page
(Now I can go on for days and days)

Just dream, dream, dream
And wish upon a star, far away from where you are
One day we'll have a ball

Ayo, '88, I saw the streets, I saw the gold, I saw my soul
I saw L.A., CA and I was sold
As a king to one day need a throne, need a home that I can own
That I can only call my own and do it all on my own
A lesson to the predecessor or the great depressor
After the Great Depression, the peasants begging for blessings
The promise of better morals, sorrow's or hollow yeses
The common out of the gesture can catch it and redirect it
She never wanted the money, fame or the fancy people
Vehicles out of Sicily, silly of me to mix up
I'm a mix of black, Indian, and white I am American stripes like a Parisian
I'm pleased to meet you in Greece again
'09 we was in our prime
Had youngins chopping onions, Kid Cudi's Day 'n' Nite
Out in Vigo, now a wino throw a C note on a couple classy people
And some vinyl from the time I say the rhyme about the eagle, I be legal
No tax, no debts, and no thievos
Just stats to make it all feel regal
But what do I know, I got more dreams and words on the page
(I can go on for days and days)
Just dream, dream, dream
And wish upon a star, far away from where you are
One day we'll have a ball
Dream, dream
Just dream, dream, dream

Ayo, '91 was grimey son, '92 was grimey too
'93 was grime to me and '94 was grime to you
'95 was mighty nice, '96, timeless shit
'97, slice of heaven like a '98 Bentely
And I started getting mine at 1-9-9-9 with the shine
2000 break the spine in '07, oh heaven
Blessed be the child that made it out without the MAC-11
Stack stacking my blessings
And as far as those roaming in space
Tell God make space for the trap rappers in heaven, uh
I got more dreams and words on the page
(I can go on for days and days)

Just dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream1Embed
