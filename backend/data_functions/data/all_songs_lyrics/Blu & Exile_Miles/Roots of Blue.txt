Roots of Blue Lyrics
Blue interlude
What's wrong the beast's sky blue hue?
 where dark culture grew
Before the Dutch man came his claim Zulu land in apartheid's name
Slowed the - so low down the white hunters sink to make this beauty beast extinct
Blue beast of beauty made by God
Zulu man's brother man his native man saw
A green land turned blue by pale weak men who care not what their creed would do
They raid sweet lands of the beasty blue
Blue like blue sea, blue like blue sky, blue like blue me
All blue like you and I beyond the melody
Yo, check it

Yo, I'm the first man standing upright, holding a stone in my hand
After beating an ape, claiming the land
Taking the stand and feeding my fam
Back when man ate they children
I'm killing other animals just to nurture them
I journey further from mine, my people, into another culture
Not knowin' my brothers 'bout to come and take over (Ayo)
We made it all the way to Asia and to Australia
Then made the passage to the Americas after all behavior
Came home and they started makin' homes outta stone
Showin' tribes around 'em how much they've grown
Yo, I'm  at the end of the of start of civilization
I'm shuttin' it down, I'm settin' out to build a nation
I'm the son of Ra, the son of Ka, father of Africa
King Khafre and King Khufu, blood of the Zulu
Osiris, Isis, Horus, Anubis, the Royal family
Akhenaten, Tutankhamun and all the Ramesses
Amam and Hotep, Mentuhotep, Thutmosis
Ahmosis, Kamose, is etymology of Moses
I'm the kings of Egypt, kings of Nubia, Mesopotamia
Mediterranean, Babylon, Saudi Arabia
I'm Muhammad comin' outta the Middle East after the Romans
Reclaiming their gold, home and their throne 'cause they own it
I'm on the first boats to reach America
We all African, we sold you to America, we not coming back
Blue antelope, no more to be
Like lynching rope with no more hope
Blue beastie, beauty antelope, no more there
Oh blue, the tragic cruelty

Ayo, I'm Adam, the original man banned from the garden
I'm Noah, pardon the flood, after the revolution started
I'm Japheth, I'm Shem, and I'm Ham
I'm Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the motherland
I'm Moses posin' against the king, freein' his people
I'm Babylon, tryna reach God by buildin' a steeple
I'm the strongest man, Samson
I'm the first king, Samuel
The prestigious king, Saul
Son of King David, I'm Solomon
I'm preachin' to the choir like Elijah
Isaiah, Jeremiah and, not a king higher than King Hezekiah
I'm on fire like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
I'm Jonah and the whale
Daniel in the lion's den
I'm Job with just a little hope
I'm John The Baptist, the messiah's comin'
God's son, Jesus Christ of Nazerath
Thank Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John for the narrative
And Paul for all the passages
Apostolic Episcopal before Constantine
Constant persecution, first century
Eventually, revolution
Islam, sixth century and on and on
Slavery, where are you takin' me to, huh? America?

"Revenge be mine" speak God divine
Nature's pain, payback is so much more

Yo, I'm Kunta Kinte 'fore he was enslaved by America
Picture the freedom before the terror
Who had to carry the black burners to Nat Turner
During a slave revolt, we came before Columbus dumped us
Off the slavery boat, the Underground Railroad, Harriet Tubman
Yeah, we probably would still be slaves if it wasn't for Fredrick Douglas
I'm up in his government before all them like Booker Washington
With all his boys like W.E.B. Du Bois and Noble Drew Ali and Marcus Garvey
Takin' us to Africa like Chancellor Williams, Chandler Owens and Asa Randolph
Last of all Muhammad, the honorable Elijah Muhammad
Louis Armstrong, Langston Hughes, and Thurgood Marshall
Richard Wright, Rosa Parks and Gordon Parks
Joe Lewis, Jackie Robinson and John Henrik Clarke
Alex Haley, James Baldwin
Malcom X, Martin Luther King Jr, Clarence 13X
Maya Angelou, Ray Charles, Minister Farrakhan
Ivan Sertima, John Cochran, Stokely Carmichael
Emmett Till, Eldridge Cleaver, Bobby Seale
Huey Newton, Muhammad Ali and even Gil Scott-Heron
Al Sharpton, Fred Hampton, Oprah Winfrey
Barack Obama, Assata Shakur, 2Pac Shakur, Biggie
And everyone else creating black history
That lives with me everyday, until I'm gone
Tasmanians all crossed death's cold door
Wiped out by 
Convict's corruption to hate's inner core
They took dark skin and they made a purse for a pale skin whore

Yo
I'm Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie
Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy
Sun Ra Orchestra, Charles Mingus, Ahmad Jamal
Milt Jack', Wes Mont', Herbie Hand-Cannonball
Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, Screamin' Jay, Howlin' Wolf
Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, B.B King, Sam Cooke
Billie Holiday, Ella Fitz, Nina Simone
Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Diana Ross
Chaka Khan, Tina Turner and Roberta Flack
Al Green, Marvin Gaye, James Brown, Michael Jack
Prince, Sly Stone, Curtis May
Roy Ayers, Temptations, 5th Dimension, O'Jays, Ohio Players
Earth, Wind and Fire, Funkadelic
Parliament, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles
Otis Redding and all the shit from the nineties
Eighties, seventies and sixties
The fifties, forties, thirties and all the twenties
All the armies, the Black Panther party, the Nation
NAACP organizations
All the black NBA, NFL and MLB players
And we can't forget Shaka Zulu (Woo)
We see you brother, Mandela

 put you on this Earth, and who are they to score your worth?
Oh this world will never be the same
Lord all of mankind, self hate, shamed, dog, free child would know your name
You looked so free before the raper came
Blue before the racist killer came
Concerned about that dope
Those who cannot cope
Blue more than you, blue more than me
Blue like sky, sea
We're all blue like you and I beyond the melody
And after 1799, not one blue brother left to find
Last one shot, that hate year
This world has never been the same
Oh bluuuueeee, oh bluueeee, oh bluuueeee
All blue, all blue
UntamedEmbed
