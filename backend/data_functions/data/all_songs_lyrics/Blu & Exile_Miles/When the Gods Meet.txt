When the Gods Meet Lyrics
A black man met a white man
It was a Tuesday, and a God was mentioned
I proposed, the next one was the perplexed one
'Cause when he reflected the sun, it was gold
And he told, suppose, about him being taller
Faster, stronger, the hustler, the baller
It's funny how the money have the earth's tone
And my pyramid, he laughed, was it the first throne?
Yo, how heavy do the levees have to be?
How comfy are your mountaintops to me?
Idea must have thought of IKEA, royal and gold
The state's color, my bed's told, it was a cold year
The hair's grey on my grandpa's ears
I would cut his hair, he would shave his beard, uh
8:30 on a Wednesday
Uh, yeah, hold up, and all the angels sing

When the Gods meet
The angels serenade you
Oh so sweet
And oversee that you bring light to the dark (Yeah, ha, check it)

There was a marriage for the sea and the sun and it was powerful
The sea told him, "If he falls, I devour you"
The sun told her, "If she flies, I shower you"
One day they both kissed the earth, a flower grew
I told my child a few stories of the power to
To have four offsprings from out the blue
And I would introduce the summer but my mother was a sucker
For the spring, she says all the pollen makes her dream
Autumn makes us think of the fallen, and how love caught 'em
And it was winter when I kissed her and wore cotton
And they would all be beholders of the weather
'Cause birds of a feather flock together, and the angels sing
When the Gods meet
The angels serenade you (And the angels sing)
Oh so sweet
And oversee that you bring light to the dark (Yeah, yeah)

Blue, the color of my mother's hair
Superman on my underwear
I got my uncle's stare, the one that isn't here
So when you see that line, you gotta double dare
My family busted heads, you probably did too
You probably deep as me, you probably is Blu
You see this crown on my head, though, ain't for no lesser God
Ain't for no lesser king, it's for the one that's dead
A furnace on the red, I took my father's prayer
Put that with what I read, and that's what got me here
Yeah, so forgive me if my halo seems lost
In a land where the dreams fall, and the angels sing

When the Gods meet
The angels serenade you
Oh so sweet (Uh)
And oversee that you bring light to the dark
Yeah, and the angels sing
Light to the dark
Oversee that you bring light to the dark
When the Gods meet, they light up the dark
Oversee that you bring light to the dark
When the Gods meet, they light up the dark
They light it up, light up the dark
They light it up, light up the darkEmbed
