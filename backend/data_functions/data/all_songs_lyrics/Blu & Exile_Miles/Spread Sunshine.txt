Spread Sunshine Lyrics
I will travel, more miles than the Africans into Asia
More miles than the Asian migration into America
More miles than two hundred Mali ships sent back to Mexico
Before Christopher Columbus discovered what we already know
More miles than Marco Polo, more miles than grandpa's Volvo
More miles than Martin's Caddy, more miles than Doug's old Jeep
I got more styles than the miles you commute every week
And more miles than the journeys of both Paul and Jesus combined
I travel more miles to reach you than original Genesis
Moses wrote in all of his various translations from Hebrew
I travel more miles to get at you than an adept can handle
I hold you down two thousand leagues beneath the ground
I travel more miles than Richard Petty, Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt
Just to prove to you what I do is hard to earn
I travel more miles than Che Guevara's motorcycle did
I travel more miles than Harriet Tubman
I will push through the snow in Russia, over mountains in China
Swim through the Pacific Ocean, walk the hot of Sahara
I will go to the depths of hell and the gates of heaven
And come back from the afterlife just to complete my mission
Spreading sunshine

Let us spread a lil' sunshine
Let us spread a lil' sunshine
Come on and spread a lil' sunshine
Let us spread a lil' sunshine
The soul provider
The sole controller of the fire
The same father that Jeremiah most high, Ayatollah
Blow the cloud out the sky, father Manowa
Same soldier that never dies
You gotta try over the soul provider
The same father of the Messiah
The most divine to find the body, soul, and the mind
The sunshine, the one no one could ever become
The eye and eye, the most merciful
The eternal, the dark knight, the circle of life, the universal
Yo, I'm 'bout to serve you heard, you just tryna match the hype
I provide soul to the soul, spoken through this gold microphone that I hold
With no god but the light, I ignite
Limitless space, intimate peace
Praise God, the Father of Christ, cipher complete
As days go by, I try not to compete but to be one with
The fire lands under the seas
Blunt lit, smoking my trees, I open my mind
Before I rhyme my thoughts intertwine with the design
Blind mice, holding a mic, don't know what it's like
'Til they become one with the light, spread like sunshine

Let us spread a lil' sunshine
Let us spread a lil' sunshine
Come on and spread a lil' sunshine
Let us spread a lil' sunshine
Ayo, my homegirl fronted, she said it wasn't what she wanted
My homeboy too, shoot, I thought I was a Jew
Gaslamp kilt it, she say she likes his hair
Blu's shows suck, so she said she doesn't care
People need help, bro, it's a fucked up way to live
But time don't stop, I gotta do this for my kid
I love you, love you, love you, like I used to tell my grandma
Cinderella tell L life's as sweet as ham hocks
Your mother is a damn ox, and you're a Rambo
Remind me of a rainbow the way your mind shines so
Colors are a gift, your explore will be granted
Your tour will of course be guided by God's hand
