All the Blues Lyrics
There was a man with a horn born in Illinois
His father was a doctor, his mother a music scholar
But he dropped out the college of music to pursue it
So what if everyone thinks you can do it? You gotta prove it
So he aimed for the top, joined Charlie Parker's band
Shooting heroin, smoking pot
By the time Miles stopped, Charlie died
Same time Miles was reaching his prime
Bad times in the city
Miles had no other choice but to get busy
He told Dizzy, reshape the music
From a silly knee-slapping good time to serious vibes
Mood jazz, cool cats, built his band with Max, Red, Coltrane and just spazzed
Even almost fought Thelonious
A true live wire, though so harmonious
But various women and serious relationships can make a switch
But deliver the classics
A modern jazz giant triumphs over the masses
Every decade, another magic trick and back again
Though so many died on his climb
He never turned his back to them
He put them on his back and walked another mile

There was a man with a joy, born in Illinois
He was my grandfather, my real mother's father
So he moved out the Chi to LA and met my grandma
Who had my little ma who was born in Los Angeles
She ran into my father who was born in Santa Monica
They played the harmonica and Chandra had a son
Born in Los Angeles, my father's first one
He would run away one day to turn me to a man
It was me who had to care for my mother, understand
I was 4, 5, more than live for a child
But much more mature for a kid my age, for sure
I swore one day that I would have my own boy
Who was born in Los Angeles and not in Illinois
Born full of joy, just like my family
Ready to be exactly what we all planned to be
A love so strong that no one can take away
So we can live as long as anybody to this day
And I would name him Miles, named after Miles DavisEmbed
