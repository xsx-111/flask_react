The Feeling Lyrics
The feeling
Only the feeling, gives real happiness
Only the feeling, nothing less
Only the feeling
Only the feeling

The feeling is gone, couldn’t even pen a good song
I had to let it go, and ask God to direct my flow
My life was blessed, even times when my life was less
I kept faith, and God kept me in a good place
I faced adversity before, not saying it was worse
I’m really saying now it’s even more
But I can’t let it put me underground
I have a kid to live for, I got to find a way to make him proud
Especially when there’s police killing children
And you got the nerve to try and ask me how I’m feeling
My nigga, I’m a black man, not trying to turn this to a racist thing
'Cause worldwide, we can see that it’s a racist thing
I think you’ll understand if I explain it like a man
But just being honest yo, I don’t have the plan
All I got is two hands, to touch what is real
And honestly, I stopped giving a fuck how you feel
The feeling
Aye yo they robbed me for everything I have
So all I ever worked for was thrown in the trash
They took all my equipment and the masters to my records
They took away the biggest part of my child’s investment
Questioned, but no I wasn’t given back a dime
'Cause I didn’t have insurance, all they're sure of is the crime
And the fact that I’m broke, and my life is on the ropes
But I got good health, trying to buy high hopes
But you never know
Some people lose a lot more, and can’t get it back
And that’s why I’m torn
I have a huge love for making music to encourage
But now I can’t afford to record no more
I got warrants for fighting and that made my life a lot harder
Not to mention I’m too poor to support my daughter
But they’ll never know so I just keep on killin’ it
Whether or not I’m even feelin’ it or fulfillin’
The feeling

Yo, the feeling is true, real, something you can feel
The feeling is deeper than any rapper’s record deal
The feeling is the healing, not the killing
The feeling is one of the reasons I’m still living
But I don’t got it brother, all I got now is God
And my will that all of me and mines survive
I’m trying to let it go, though I never thought I would
I kept it so deep inside, I never thought I could
Not sure if it returns, or if it just burns
But I learned, the feeling is something that’s confirmed
Though it’s not eternal, and it’s not deep as love
I know back then I felt it like blood
I can hug, I can kiss, I can even get dissed
But all I know is the feeling will surely be missed
I felt you, and yeah it almost felt like I held you
The real is the only thing that can replace the feeling
The feeling
It’s the feeling
It’s the feeling

The feeling
Only the feeling, gives real happiness
Only the feeling, nothing less
Only the feeling, makes a friendship true
The feeling that I feel for you
Only the feeling, makes life feel alright
The feeling, every day and night
Only the feeling, makes true desire
Only the feeling, takes the feeling higher
Only the feeling, makes the baby smile
Only the feeling, makes a man a child
Now only the feeling, makes a house a home
Only the feeling, makes a word a poem
Joy is the feeling that we feel so strong
Only feeling right makes you not feel wrong
Lust and greed feeling, others are leaning
Without feeling, life has not much meaning
Only the feeling, makes true songs to sing
Only the feeling, makes God men be king
Only choice is right or wrong but never in between
Only the feeling, makes a girl a queen
Only the feeling, we shouldn’t be dealing
No killing, or stealing, when people use feeling
Only the feeling, makes your children try
Hate for all feeling, makes the heroes die
Only the feeling, makes the world at peace
Only the feeling, makes love ones release
Live life with feeling, drugs don’t have to be
Only the feeling, makes your life carefree
Only the feeling, makes you feel God’s grace
The feeling for the human race
Only the feeling, God plants life through seeds inside
The feeling of nature, man’s foot is never dry
Only the feeling, makes the water flow
Only the feeling, makes true birth grow
The feeling of self-worth brings joy back to this earth
The feeling of self-pride, makes you feel so good inside
Self-respect and knock on wood, rejecting lust each man should
Only the feeling makes you laugh
Feel so good, be thankful and kneeling for the feeling
Yes we should be dealing with only the feeling
Only the feeling, of great joy from a little girl or boy
Oh yes, it’s the feeling, evil can’t destroy
Only the feeling, creates harmony
The feeling that you feel for me
Only the feel of love, makes life feel divine
The feeling of friendship, makes you yours, makes you mine
Yes, our love is dealing with only the feeling
Inspired by Alexis Watson, soulmate, my companion, dedicating the world
Epilogue
The world is worth healing, because of the feeling
Nature’s dealing with only the feeling
Yes, but only the feeling
Only the feeling
Yes, our love is dealing, with only the feeling1Embed
