Bright As Stars Lyrics
Crazy, lately how the world is baby
(You may) have to find a way on your own
Oh all that glitters ain't gold
You'll always reap what you sow
And once you shine, they'll all know

A South Central state of mind
Devout Christians and niggas doing time
Where everybody be trying to shine under that hollywood sign
I been in line ever since I was six
I saw Magic and LL and I just wanted to be rich, 'cause we wasn't
We was struggling, I never got anything I wanted as a kid
I would see other kids and get pissed
Like they got mad gifts for Christmas
Yo, how did Santa miss us?
It's time to grow up and get bucks
Seen these rappers drive them big trucks pulling up to big cribs
I told my mama that that's how I wanna live
So I picked up a pen and started rapping bout riches
Having dreams about prostituting my image to get bitches
Then I changed it up 'cause I was lame as fuck
And this rapper ate me up
Never that, you only after major bucks, you ain't the same as us
Blu been kicking raps back when kids was kicking snaps
Eating grandma's chicken bags in the back
Bout to bust rolling up, thinking up the dopest shit
I just need to get some beats to get my niggas in the streets
And yeah we did, but when I bumped into Exile, I realized
That it's about getting respect and not the checks
Now I checked out a bunch of shit I slept on and kept making songs
Hoping one day I would catch on, then I wrote my best songs
Expressing the truth about my adolescence
That's when blessings start falling from the heavens, like
Crazy, lately how the world is baby
(You may) have to find a way on your own
Oh all that glitters ain't gold
You'll always reap what you sow
And once you shine, they'll all know

I remember when hip-hop was the only soley thing I had to do, that young Aceyalonely one
And everyone that know me so I went for the feel of a can
Tried to do a back spin on my head and my hand
Even got two records to blend, was a fan till I seen a mic right on a stand
And that's right, they understand, yo we made it a lifestyle
The wildstyle freestyle, finally I'm nice now
Wow, tell em to pipe down and put the pipe down
Still never compares to that incredible right now
That on the spot beat rocks, I get a rush
With the world on my shoulder and love in my clutch
Doing too much to touch us, way more than golden
Roses on the stage when the last show closes
Rolling to the steel drag right on the asphalt
Thanking my lucky stars that I'm here for the last part
The art, the last should be right at the start
Leimert Park, lion heart, that's a circle of sharks
Off the charts just to be a never forgotten we keep rockin
Tomahawk talking the stocking the new concoction
And building blocks in when the beautiful mile is the only option to not be in a box or a coffin
Crazy, lately how the world is baby
(You may) have to find a way on your own
Oh all that glitters ain't gold
You'll always reap what you sow
And once you shine, they'll all know

A revelation to the world (it's never been fine)
Only when it's blackened out (can you see the stars)
I dream in blackness
I'm the brilliant brightest light shining in blackness
I dream, I dream, I dream, I dream
I'm the brilliant brightest light and I shine
A revalation to the world (it's never been fine)
You may shine in Hollywood (I shine on Crenshaw)
I dream (blackness)
I'm the brilliant brightest light shining in blackness
I dream, I dream, I dream, I dream
I'm the brilliant brightest light and I shine

Blue is one of the most beautiful colors in the world
The sky is blue, you got a clear day, people pour out to the beach, the water's blue, it's green without pollution, and everybody's having fun
How do you associate blue with such a sad, slumped down  state of unhappiness? That's not the blues, those are the cloudsEmbed
