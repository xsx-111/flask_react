Grace Kelly Blues Lyrics

The cut-rate mime walking through the dirty streets
Of Paris in the hot August heat
Sun melting the fake smile away
Just looking for a place to stay
The actress gave up all her old dreams
And traded up now she is a queen
Royal families don't have time for that shit
Your crystal ball, you keep it hid
The tractor trailer driver radios:
Help me someone I'm out here all alone
Truck driving the black night away
Prayin' for the light of day


The kid in the mall works at hawt dawg on a stick
His hat is a funny shape his heart is a brick
Taking your order he will look away
He doesn't have a thing to say
But me I'm feeling pretty good as of now
I'm not so sure when I got here or how
Sun melting the fake smile away
I think, you know, I'll be okayEmbed
