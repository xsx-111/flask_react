The Sound of Fear LyricsSun comes up on the old neighbourhood
Spray painted bricks and dead firewood
Well, I don't know where I'm gonna be next
I don't care where I'm gonna be
Next time, if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another sound of fear
Some people like to call me Chuck
It's "Charles" and you are shit outta luck
If you think you know what happens next
You think you know what happens
Next time, if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another sound of fear
Sun goes down on the old neighborhood
Dark damp has stopped where I once stood
I don't know where the bus stops next
And I don't care where the bus stops
Next time, if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another sound of fear
The sound of fear
I can hear
The sound of fearEmbed
