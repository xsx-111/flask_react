I Like Birds LyricsI can't look at the rocket launch
The trophy wives of the astronauts
And I won't listen to their words
Cause I like
Birds
I don't care for walkin' downtown
Crazy auto-car gonna mow me down
Look at all the people like cows in a herd
Well, I like
Birds
If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
I can't stand in line at the store
The mean little people are such a bore
But it's alright if you act like a turd
Cause I like
Birds
If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on
I've got a feeder for you to perch on1Embed
