Tiger in My Tank LyricsI bought some rock star ashes
From the back of Rolling Stone
I guess he wouldn't mind it
They couldn't sell his soul
The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feelin so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disaster
I had a dream last night
The TV and the phone
Grew some legs and took a walk
And left me all alone
The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feelin so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disaster
When I grow up I'll be
An angry little whore
I'll give you all the finger
I'll sell you all what for
The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feeling so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disasterEmbed
