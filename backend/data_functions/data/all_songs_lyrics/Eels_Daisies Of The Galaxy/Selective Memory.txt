Selective Memory LyricsIf I lay my head down
I will see you in my dream
Wearing that polka-dot dress
And sitting by the stream
Leaning in to hear you
You will whisper in my ear
And everything I need to know
I finally hear
I wish I could remember
But my selective memory won't let me
When I was a baby
We would go out to the park
And sit out in the fountain
Splashing 'round until it's dark
The days go on forever
When you only know that much
And everything you need to know
Is answered with one touch
I wish could remember
But my selective memory won't let meEmbed
