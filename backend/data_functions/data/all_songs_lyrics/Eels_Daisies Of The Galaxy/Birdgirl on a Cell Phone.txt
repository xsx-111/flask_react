Birdgirl on a Cell Phone LyricsShe has eyes disability blue
A German dog and strict curfew
And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she's turned the script to another page
And she doesn't really give a damn
What you have to say
She makes a call on her friend's cell phone
The operator answers and says "You're not alone"
And if one man's ceiling is another's dance floor
Then she'll be the one running to the sea shore
Trying to tell the seagulls
This is home
And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she'll be the one wiser than her age
Trying to get the message to your earEmbed
