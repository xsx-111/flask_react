Flyswatter Lyrics
Little field mice living under the house
Never eating much, tough life for a mouse
And if you think you're gonna be spared, you're wrong

Field mice, head lice, spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout whatever keeps you itchin'
Ice water, flyswatter, gonna get you through
The day
Heat is rolling in like hell's red rug
Stinking like the breath of Beelzebub
And if you think you won't walk on coals, you will

Field mice, head lice, spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout whatever keeps you itchin'
Ice water, flyswatter, gonna get you through
The day, the day

Field mice, head lice, spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout whatever keeps you itchin'
Ice water, flyswatter, gonna get you through
The day
That's real goodEmbed
