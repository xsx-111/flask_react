Packing Blankets Lyrics
Today is a lovely day to run
Start up the car with the sun

Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seen

Cross when the drawbridge light is green
Don't look back to that messed-up scene

Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seen

And all our troubles will be gone
Blowing out over that bridge
Floating up into the sky
Making the storm clouds cry
La-da-da-da-da
La, la-da-da-da
Put out that smoke and breath some air
Get a new name and cut your hair

Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seenEmbed
