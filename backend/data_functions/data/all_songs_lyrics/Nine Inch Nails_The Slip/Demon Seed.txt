And I can feel it breathe
I have been trying
To behave myself
It keeps growing
And I can feel it breathe

To behave myself

And I can feel it breathe
I have been trying
To behave myself
It keeps growing
And I can feel it breathe
I have been trying
To tolerate you

And I can feel it breathe
I have been trying
To tolerate you
It keeps growing
And I can feel it breathe
I have been trying
To tolerate you

Well I am reaching the point
Well I am reaching the point
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

I thought this would go away

And I will use my fist
To destroy
Everything I can
I will use my voice
And I will use my fist
To destroy
Everything I can
I will use my voice
And I will use my fist
To destroy
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Everything I can
I will use my voice
And I will use my fist
To destroy
