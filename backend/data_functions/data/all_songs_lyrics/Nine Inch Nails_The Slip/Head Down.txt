Head Down Lyrics
You, what you looking at?
Head down, too late for that
What you want - what you get
Know your place, don't ever forget

And this is not my face and this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here I can recognize
And this is all a dream and none of you are real
I'll give anything, I'll give anything

Hey you, what you running from?
All your hate, what you've become
Bet you didn't think, it would happen to you
All used up half way through

And this is not my face and this is not my life
And there is not a single thing here, I can recognize
And this is all a dream and none of you are real
And I'll give anything, you know, I'll give anything4Embed
