1,000,000 Lyrics
Kind of hard, hard to see
When you crawl on your hands and your knees
With your face in the trough
Wait your turn, while they finish you off
Don't know when it started, don't know how
Should have found out, should have happened by now
Got these lines on my face
After all this time and I still haven't found my place

I jump from every rooftop
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all

I wake up, on the floor
Start it up again, like it matters anymore
I don't know if it does
Is this really all that there ever was?
Put the gun in my mouth
Close your eyes, blow my fucking brains out
Pretty patterns on the floor
That's enough for you, but I still need more, more, more
I jump from every rooftop
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all
I jump from every rooftop (Is this really all)
So high so far to fall
I feel a million miles away
I don't feel any thing at all

I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything
I don't feel anything (A million miles away)
I don't feel anything (A million miles away)
I don't feel anything (A million miles away)
I don't feel anything2Embed
