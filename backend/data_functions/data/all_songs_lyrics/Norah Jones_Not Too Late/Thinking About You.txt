Thinking About You LyricsYesterday I saw the sun shining
And the leaves were fallin' down softly
My cold hands needed a warm, warm touch
And I was thinkin' about you
But here I am lookin' for signs to lead me
You hold my hand, but do you really need me?
I guess it's time for me to let you go
But I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
So when you sail across the ocean waters
And you reach the other side safely
Could you smile a little smile for me?
'Cause I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about youEmbed
