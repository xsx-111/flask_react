2 Men LyricsThere are two men sitting in the same bar
And I have kissed them both
But that's okay
They don't know each other
And I'll keep it that way
There are two sets of lips that I have kissed
All in the same room
And I don't know
If that's a good thing
But I think it's okay
Its not like I kissed them both
On the same day
Each one of them is something to me
I don't know how to explain
That each one of them means love to me
Don't know how it can be
There are two men in the same bar
And I have missed them both
But that's okay they don't know that I'm here
So I'll turn and walk awayEmbed
