Not Too Late LyricsTell me how you've been
And tell me what you've seen
And tell me that you'd like to see me too
'Cause my heart is full of no blood
And my cup is full of no love
Couldn't take another sip even if I wanted
But it's not too late, hm
It's not too late for love
My lungs are out of air
And yours are holding smoke
And it's been like that now for so long
And I've seen people try to change
And I know it isn't easy
But nothin' worth the time ever really is
And it's not too late, hm
It's not too late for love
For love
For love
For loveEmbed
