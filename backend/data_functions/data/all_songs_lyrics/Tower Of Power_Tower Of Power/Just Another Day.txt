Just Another Day LyricsGoing through the day, sometimes lonely
Trying to find myself a thrill
Little do I know it might come to me
Hanging out my window sill
Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old again, slowly drifting
Yes, I know my life is kind of strange
The thrill came down, but didn't last
Day by day the same old changes
Time seems to pass so fast
Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old boat, aimlessly drifting
(horns/ guitar solo)
Good and bad, its supposed to be, full of
Thats the way they always told me
Life is filled(a wheel), with many displays
Ive been blessed with simple ways
Dreaming that im drifting, on clouds of satin
I ride them till I get my fill
I just got to worry 'bout the pace Im keeping
Making sure Im still for real
Just another day, has gone, gone and left me
In the same old boat..hey, again, slowly drifting
(add back ground) repeat chorusEmbed
