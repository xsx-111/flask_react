Clever Girl LyricsClever girl you fooled me once again
Clever girl seems I can remember when
There was a time I didn't have you on my mind
But that heart of mine made me think the winnin' card
Was mine
Now I start to understand I must be just part of your
Plan
Must be part of your plan girl
Just must be part of your plan
Clever girl you got me on the run
Clever girl this time lovin' ain't no fun
I knew right from the start that only you could touch
My heart
The way you move my soul girl you have complete control
But now the time has come for me to deal the final hand
Gonna call your bluff girl
Just got to show you my stuff
Soon the game will come to an end
And the'll be nothin' left for you to do except pretend
You're a clever girl in the game you will remain
Oh, but clever girl thing's will never be the same
You just keep on runnin' the'll be no place to go
After all your friends have vanished
You'll find yourself alone
Maybe then you'll realize you won't so clever after all
You're headed for a fall girl
Then you'll have no one at all
Clever girl
