What Is Hip Lyrics
So ya wanna dump out yo' trick bag
Ease on in a hip thang
But you ain't exactly sure what is hip
So you started to let your hair grow
Spent big bucks on your wardrobe
Somehow, ya know there's much more to the trip

What is hip?
Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip?
If you're really hip
The question, "Will it show?"
You're into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
What is hip?

You became a part of a new breed
Been smokin' only the best weed
Hangin' out with the so called "Hippie set."
Seen in all the right places
Seen with just the right faces
You should be satisfied, but it ain't quite right
What is hip?
Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip?
If you're really hip
The question, "Will it show?"
You're into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
What is hip?

Come on

Hipness is. What it is
Hipness is. What it is
Hipness is. What it is
Sometimes hipness is, what it ain't

You went an' found you a guru
In an effort to find you a new you
And maybe even raise your conscious level
While you're striving to find the right road
There's one thing you should know
"What's hip today, might become pass√©'."
What is hip?
Tell me, tell me, if you think you know
What is hip?
If you're really hip
The question, "Will it show?"
You're into a hip trip
Maybe hipper than hip
What is hip?

Think about it y'all

Hipness is. What it is
Hipness is. What it is
Hipness is. What it is
Sometimes hipness is, what it ain't

What is hip?
Ahhhhhhhhh
What is hip?
I'd like to know
What is hip?
Is it in the style of your hair?
What is hip?
Is it in the clothes that you wear?
What is hip?
I'd like to know
What is hip?
I'd like to know
What is hip?
What is hip y'all? Hey
What is hip?
Hey! Oh
What is hip?
What is hip y'all?
What is hip?
I wanna know
What is hip?
Ahhhhhhh
What is hip?
I wanna know what hipness isEmbed
