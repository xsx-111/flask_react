You and Me Lyrics
Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart
Let the loving start
Open up and let the light back in

I was thinking of you and me
Making love beneath the tree
And now I wonder could it be
Thinking 'bout the times we had
Some were good and some were bad
Guitar fighting the T.V

I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking of you and me
I was thinking about you and me

Looking at you just the other night
Dancing in the evening light
True love conquers all
Old man sitting there
Touch of grey, but he don't care
When he hears his children call
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking about you and me
I was thinking of you and me
I was thinking about you and me

Open up your eyes
See how life time flies
Open up and let the light back in
Open up your heart
Let the loving start
Open up and let the light back inEmbed
