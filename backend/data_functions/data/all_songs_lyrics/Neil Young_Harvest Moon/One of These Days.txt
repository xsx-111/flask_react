One of These Days Lyrics
One of these days
I'm going to sit down and write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
And I'm going to try
And thank them all for the good times together
Though so apart we've grown

One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

And I'm going to thank
That old country fiddler
And all those rough boys
Who play that rock 'n' roll
I never tried to burn any bridges
Though I know I let some good things go
One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long

From down in L.A
All the way to Nashville
From New York City
To my Canadian prairie home
My friends are scattered
Like leaves from an old maple
Some are weak, some are strong

One of these days
I'm going to sit down
And write a long letter
To all the good friends I've known
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
And it won't be long, it won't be long1Embed
