War of Man Lyrics
The little creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again

Ears ringing from the battle fire
The tired warrior aims a little higher
The black falcon or the little sparrow
The healing light or the flash of the barrel

No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man

Silver mane flying in the wind
Down through the planets on the run again
No one knows where they're running to
But every kind is coming two by two
Out on the delta
Where the hoofbeats pound
The daddy's running on the frozen ground
Can't smell the poison as it follows him
Can't see the gas and machines, it's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of man

The windows open and the little girl dreams
The sky's her playground as she mounts her steed
Across the heavens to the other side
On wings of magic does the little girl ride

The baby creatures run in from the cold
Back to the nest just like the days of old
There in the safety of a mother's arms
The warmth of ages, far away from harm again

No one wins
It's a war of man
No one wins
It's a war of manEmbed
