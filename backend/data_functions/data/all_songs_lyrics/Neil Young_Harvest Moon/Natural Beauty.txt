Natural Beauty Lyrics
On the roller coaster ride
That my emotions have to take me on
I heard a newborn baby cry
Through the night

I heard a perfect echo die
Into an anonymous wall
Of digital sound
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul

A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh
My love
Or someday you might find
Your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature

Amazon
You had so much
And now so much is gone
What are you going to do
With your life?
What a lucky man
To see the earth
Before it touched his hand
What an angry fool
To condemn
One more night to go
One more sleep
Upon your burning banks
A greedy man never knows
What he's done
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature
Don't judge yourself too harsh
My love
Or someday you might find
Your soul endangered
A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature

Went to the rodeo today
I saw the cowgirls
Lined up on the fence
A brand new Chevrolet
A brand new pair of seamless pants
We watched the moment of defeat
Played back over on the video screen
Somewhere deep inside
Of my soul

A natural beauty should be preserved
Like a monument to nature2Embed
