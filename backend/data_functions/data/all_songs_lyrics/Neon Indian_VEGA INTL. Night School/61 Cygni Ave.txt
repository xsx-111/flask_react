61 Cygni Ave Lyrics
Up all night with the radio
Star peppered black draping over me (2x)
Walking down the street
Bad blood to napalm ratio
No love in class for the absentee (2x)
Walking down the street
Call up the party high priest
Oh where, oh where do the people go (2x)
They're having the party at

61 Cygni Avenue (2x)
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you

I'm just looking for the party
I'm just looking for the heart beat

Kim walks the block for the antidote
Giving the leather clad third degree (2x)
Walking down the street
But all 2 bucks gets is an anecdote
And a paranoid schizo reciting every major historic
Outbreak of the past 80 years
Walking down the street
We got something in store for you
We got something in store
We got something in store for you
At subway's end
Cause we're having the party at

61 Cygni Avenue (2x)
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you

I'm just looking for the party
I'm just looking for the heart beatEmbed
