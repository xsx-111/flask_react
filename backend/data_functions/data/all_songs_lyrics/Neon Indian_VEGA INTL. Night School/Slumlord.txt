Slumlord Lyrics
In the middle of May
In the seconds of the very last shades of day
I see that nobody's kids anymore
Though we looked that way from the 24th floor window
'Cause it's easy to be the miser when no one's the wiser
Easy to shake down
Easy to glean the green from Bayridge to Queens
Easy to wear the crown

They say that this place ain't got a heart
'Cause I can still hear the beat
And every night is oh-oh-oh-ah-oh, oh-oh-oh-ah-oh
From all the way down the street

It goes on and on and (As long as you got the money)
On and on and (As long as you got the money)
On and on and (As long as you got the money)
On and on and (the slumlord doesn't care)

Staying out the hallway and hold tight till Saturday
'Cause you got the rent to pay
Dreams of shelling out next to none, with no rubicon
Well, honey, those days are done
Shelling out three Gs for four walls and keys
Hey, at least you can run the town
Shaking our pockets loose, but hey, what's the use?
I guess we're takin' it sitting down

They say that this place ain't got a heart
'Cause I can still hear the beat
And every night is oh-oh-oh-ah-oh, oh-oh-oh-ah-oh
From all the way down the street

It goes on and on and (As long as you got the money)
On and on and (As long as you got the money)
On and on and (As long as you got the money)
On and on and (As long as you got the money)

It goes on and on and (But they want that money)
On and on and (But they want that money-eh-eh-eh-ey)
On and on and (But they want that money)
On and on and (But they want that money-eh-eh-eh-ey)

E' cos√¨ che vive la discoteca il pubblico xenoniano
Con la sua piccola adventure
In una maniera diversa, alla nostra maniera!6Embed
