Techno Clique LyricsThere won't be heartbreak in the room tonight
No sentiment to speak of
No names to remember
Just you and I
Just you and I
There won't be heartbreak in the room tonight
No politic to serve
Only ticking, endless ticking
Fluent as a tongue
Just you and I
Just you and I
Just you and I
Just you and I
May it never go unsung
Just you and I
May it never go unsung
Just you and I
May it never go unsung
Just you and IEmbed
