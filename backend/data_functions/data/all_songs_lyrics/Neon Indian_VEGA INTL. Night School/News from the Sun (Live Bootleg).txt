News from the Sun (Live Bootleg) Lyrics
Don't turn around, they say
Marching in the hit parade
Oh, don't let it get away
Get away
You were blissful in the dive
Yea, while the world took five
You were counting the days
Oh, you're standing for something

Tangled up in the arms of the night
But I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sun

More afraid to die unknown
Than to die alone
Oh you gotta give it up
You're just a young thing
And your dreams have a restless host
There's no giving up the ghost
You stand your post
Yeah you're still caught in the upswing
And time pulls at you like a tireless child
When all you wanna do is stay while
Stay a while
Tangled up in the arms of the night
But I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sun
I'm just
Tangled up in the arms of the night
But I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sun

We're all just waiting for something, yea
Oh just waiting for something, something
Till love touches you like a hand in the dark

Tangled up in the arms of the night
But I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sun
I'm just
Tangled up in the arms of the night
But I just can't wait for the light
And hear the news from the sun
News from the sun
News from the sunEmbed
