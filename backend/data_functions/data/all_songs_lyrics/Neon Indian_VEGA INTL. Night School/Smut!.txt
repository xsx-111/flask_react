Smut! Lyrics
You can't- you can't do this
Hey, more champagne?
It's gone, it's finished
Is it?
Oh, here have some

In the shelves of the video store
In the cherry red corridor is where I, found you
Chintzy as a neon sign, but you
Still threw me the powerline
I guess you had nothing to do
Magically the cabs were quiet
During the usual avenue yellow riot
I guess you're going with someone
Tell me, does it double your fun
To be cruel? To be cruel?

She says she's, single after sundown
All good fun till the shakedown
Single after sundown
All good fun till the shakedown

In the eve of the summertime, true love only part-time, eh eh
And this is truth
In your skin tight neoprene
I'm a loaded magazine, or is that uncouth?
I know it's wrong but I'm overruled, tonight she takes me to night school (oh oh oh)
(Hey that's the name of the record!)
As she turns up the traffic jams, and the brakes are slammed, she asks
Would that be cool? Would that be cool?
She says she's single after sundown
All good fun till the shakedown
She says she's single after sundown
All good fun till the shakedown

And yea we're gonna kick it, yeah, anyway she can
Go on, turn up the traffic jams
We all have those feelings
We need to console2Embed
