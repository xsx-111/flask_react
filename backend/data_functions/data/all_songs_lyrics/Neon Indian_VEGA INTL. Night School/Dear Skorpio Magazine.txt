Dear Skorpio Magazine LyricsEverytime I see, her
Her walking down the street, ha ha ha
Walking down the street
I'm wondering who she's gonna meet
Often from a distance
Always so discreet
To keep that prowler's pace through
The dirty sneaker squeak

But let me tell ya
I feel a certain way
Feel a certain way
And if she ever
If she ever came this way
If she ever came this way, ooh
Everytime I see her
My heartbeat's on display, ha ha
Heartbeat's on display
And the graffiti melts away
The fluorescent  hour
Never gave a wink of sleep
For the one who's huffing vapors
From a love they'll never keep
But let me tell ya
I feel a certain way
Feel a certain way
Wait a second
Here she comes this way
Here she comes this way

We made eyes, we made eyes
Dear Skorpio Magazine
Let me give you the scene
We made eyes

Dear Skorpio Magazine
We made eyes, we made eyes
Dear Skorpio Magazine
Let me give you the scene
We made eyes
