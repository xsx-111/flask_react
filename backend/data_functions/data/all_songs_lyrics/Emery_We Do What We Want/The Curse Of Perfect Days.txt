The Curse Of Perfect Days LyricsAnd you knew exactly when, you gave your heart and all of it
Without a thought of what you meant, you knew you couldn't live without this
So make your excuses now, that time has stolen all that you've earned
Make your excuses now, that time has stolen her
Time has stolen her
Tell me that I'm a fool
That I've exaggerated the situation
'Cause I've never been scared like this
Of losing more than I have to give
It's so unfair
I believed I could handle this
I swore I could fix everything
But I told myself lies all of these years
I told myself lies, all of these years
I told myself lies, all of these years
The fear that moves in and stays here
The words that replay in your ears
The grip that you held has weakened
Was the life that was yours forsaken
But I can't take my eyes off of you
And we were still so cool
Our bodies smooth and young (bodies smooth and young)
The dreams of getting older
Were never supposed to come (were never supposed to come)
The curse of perfect days
You forget just what you've made (forget just what you've made)
And you find yourself just praying
For something more than this life
Something more than this life
We wait for the doctors, to prescribe their medicines
And hold their bad news, as if later it will make more sense
But I've never been scared like this (It's so unfair)
Just waiting for my strength to give (I thought I could handle this)
But this is the rock, I broke myself against (I swore I could fix anything)
We believed we'd have our way (And we did, and we did)
The memories we have made (Everyday was the best day of my life)
I could never repay what I owe (Or replace the book we wrote)
Even though I read the ending before the start
I would have never changed a single part
Tell me I'm a fool, tell me I'm just scared
Say I'm such a drama queen, it's not even fair
And let me see your eyes, the love that's right behind
And I'll promise you
That it will never die
It will never die
And we were still so cool
Our bodies smooth and young
The dreams of getting older
Were never supposed to come
The curse of perfect days
You forget just what you've made
And you find yourself just praying
For something more than this life
I want so much more than this lifeEmbed
