Scissors LyricsIn your brilliance, you became the only voice you trust
If it's true then I'm dead, right where I stand
Was the plan always this vicious
You thought that your faith would carry you home
But it left me there in the waiting room alone
As I planned what to say, to the ones I'd be leaving
All praise and honor seem so far away
I never saw this coming you can lose what you found
And here comes the breakdown
Careful, careful watch your mouth
You're talking like you're such the innocent (accidents, accidents are we all?)
These words will be the death of you
This I swear this I know
The blame will find your hands
The blame has found these hands
It's hard to live this, to know if I mean it
To let you know you have me, that I never can forget it
And these last words I say here
Are the last words that I will share (last words that I will share)
So God I'm asking you do you even care
My hands are shaking and they won't stop, as the world becomes a hospital room
I am not the one to ever disappear, but it's over now (over now)
Say it for the last time, one last time
I want to let go of this world for you
Careful, careful watch your mouth
You're talking like you're such the innocent (accidents, accidents are we all?)
These words will be the death of you
This I swear this I know
The blame will find your hands
The blame has found these hands
Hands held toward the sky
In the cool air of October
The whispers were always there
But they never caught up to your words
So will December find me all alone
The wishful face of the believer
Hope, but there is doubt that bleeds through
Still, I am arrested by your presence
Nothing will compare to you1Embed
