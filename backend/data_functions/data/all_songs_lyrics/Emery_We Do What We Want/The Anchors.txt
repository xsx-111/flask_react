The Anchors LyricsAnd it hurt just to touch
On the words I said too much
I was just a kid
I thought that I could not be caught and much less by a moment
But the words came flooding from my mouth
Some things will never surface
They capsized so long ago
I didn't want to still be sinking
But the anchor, won't let me go
Those things that we thought, were never there
Those ghosts we brought with us everywhere
From your birth you were born in to this
Never knowing when the walls would crack
In your defense you were so unprepared
You said the things that you can't take back
Those things that we thought were never there
Those ghosts we brought with us everywhere
I want to explain this but nothing's making sense
There's poison in my blood
It claimed both of our lives
That world we thought important
Crumbled into nothing
Will words define me?
I am more than a moment
Will words define me?
I am more than a moment
That day behind me, but I cannot shake it
I am more than a moment, more than a moment
And the beauty left my eyes
I was standing there with the rest of my life
Knowing I would never be the same
Knowing I had changed
I had become more than what I had dreamed
The look of the youth but with hands stained
The look of the youth but with my hands stained
Tell them I'm sorry
Tell them I'm sorry
Does she know I'm sorry?
Guilty, guilty, I am guilty
How were those words in my head? (I am so sorry for what I have done)
For somebody else, somebody else (they all asked me why and I know)
I wish that I could have said (I know I still can't stop myself)
Anything else, anything else
I want to explain this but nothing's making sense
There's poison in my blood
It claimed both of our lives
That world we thought important
Crumbled into nothing but
The bitter treasures so elementaryEmbed
