I Never Got to See The West Coast LyricsSo is it courage or strength
And is that what I'm waiting for?
If I could just kill myself
Would it also kill the remorse?
I wanted so badly to catch a break
But I'm only breaking down
I'm still here and standing
But if it's up to me, I don't think?
I'll be?. hanging around
The drink slips down my throat and the burn cures nice and slow all the worst parts I wouldn't want you to see
The only parts left of me now?
Here I am, just a kid without a better plan
But it's the simple thoughts that haunt me the most
...I never got to see the west coast
Spend my nights just asking why
Would God let me become like this
Was it a joke from the start
Was I s'posed to laugh more at it?
And everyone's quoting the teachers and preachers
But their words make me feel so alone
No one ever says that they've had those thoughts in the middle of the night
No one ever admits that they wanted to take their life
The drink slips down my throat
And the burn cures nice and slow
All the worst parts I wouldn't want you to see
The only parts left of me now
Here I am just a kid without a better plan
But it's the simple thoughts that haunt me the most
... I never got to see the west coast
But it's the life I dreamed I d have
The love I would find in my grasp
The words I could share with someone...
Those thoughts keep the breath in my lungs
The tomorrow my hope will become
Fulfilled by a Love that can't be undone...
....And save a wretch like me
So if the drink slips down your throat
And the burn cures nice and slow
All the worst parts you wouldn't want me to see
The same parts I have in me now?
It scares me, too, we are both this way?
I feel just like you do
But when you're by yourself you should know...
...One day we gotta see the west coastEmbed
