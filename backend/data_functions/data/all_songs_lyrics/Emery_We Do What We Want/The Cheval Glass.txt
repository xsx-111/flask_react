The Cheval Glass LyricsTurn the cheval glass and find, corruption under my skin, and mine
You're so far from safety, put your fingers to your eyes
And steal yourself away
Repetition 
It will not be satisfied 
You can not accomplish this
You can not be satisfied
The worst isn't ever the curse of the cleverest lines
Sang the song of never, never believed that you meant it this time

It's time to back all your big words, so come on now, come on now
But you're all lipstick and cheap skirts, you're the shining light until it hurts
Tonight, I'll make this bleed light up the sky with my misdeeds
Cause I hate I hate I hate this, I hate this
I fell from the first time
Fall was upon us with all the leaves turning, you were so sure of yourself
You were asking me questions of us getting older
You hardly could catch your breath (I wanted anything else)
And I've asked, for the after remorse (To stay)
And still these hands, but it never takes, never takes
Old habits are so hard to break
So you fall, and circle through your life, that can't be seen
Avoid the brilliant lights that find you
Because when they do, you know you'll have to
It's time to back all your big words, so come on now, come on now
But you're all lipstick and cheap skirts, you're the shining light until it hurts
Tonight, I'll make this bleed light up the sky with my misdeeds
Cause I hate I hate I hate this, I hate this
I fell from the first time
There's not enough wisdom or perception
Judge this now, take back your life
You are dying and the time you spent was wasted
On all the sick dreams of the lie (the lie, the lie)
Pull yourself out, made yourself in your own image
The praise you gave thousands of time
Lifted yourself up to the sky (the sky)
Bow before all that you've done
The sky, the sky, bow before all that you've doneEmbed
