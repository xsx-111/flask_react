You Wanted It Lyrics
Run you coward, you run
These words crippled my confidence
The hymn I can't escape from
This is over and done with
This race has made me more than weary, I am dead

I created everything here that I wanted to see
(So was that your plan, to leave me out?)
We were all reciting messages and pushing repeat
(But this world you made, does it let you breathe?)
Does it let you feel
Anything but yourself?
When was the last time
Does it let you breathe?
Does it let you feel anything but yourself?
When was the last time you saw anyone else?

Whispers and echoes of love fading

The plans you made, you wanted it
The bitter taste, you wanted it
What God became you wanted it
But the one thing you need you'll never get
There was more of you and less of me
You blamed it on the chemistry
Can you close your eyes when you rest your head?
It didn't have to be this way but you wanted it
They were just calendar days
I'm sure it's all written down
But if you'll let me just ask
Is this how you bring the crowd (to their feet?!)
You hurt because it wasn't about you (About me?)
You're always scared the floor is gonna give way (I call the shots)
We could end this, we could end this (Don't you ever tell me what I've got!)

Whispers and echoes of love fading

The plans you made, you wanted it
The bitter taste, you wanted it
What God became you wanted it
But the one thing you need you'll never get
There was more of you and less of me
You blamed it on the chemistry
Can you close your eyes when you rest your head?
It didn't have to be this way but you wanted it
(I wanted, I wanted, I wanted, I wanted this!)

(Blessed assurance) You made it such a lonely world
Such a very lonely world
(Jesus is mine) You bent the answers into questions
You let the voice go unheard
(O, what a foretaste) And you couldn't trust yourself
Cause what if everything you felt
(Of glory divine!) Meant this was not yours alone
(Heir of salvation) Every single word, every single little word that was said
(Purchase of God) And all the simple fears
And all the nights that you cried in your bed
(Born of His spirit) Hoping I was there but you told yourself
You're old and alone
(Washed in His blood) But you were never the widow you left on your own
I was washed in the blood
I was born of a spirit but I drowned
When you found me out there
(Rejoice! Rejoice! The old King is dead!
Long live the new king!
I am the new king!)

Whispers and echoes of love fading

The plans you made, you wanted it
The bitter taste, you wanted it
What God became you wanted it
But the one thing you need you'll never get
There was more of you and less of me
You blamed it on the chemistry
Can you close your eyes when you rest your head?
It didn't have to be this way but you wanted itEmbed
