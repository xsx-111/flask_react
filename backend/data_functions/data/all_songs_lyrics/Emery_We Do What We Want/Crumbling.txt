Crumbling LyricsI fell in love with the world
(She gave me) everything that I deserve
(I had) all that I wanted and more, right in my hands
(Some things just never last)
She ran away with the sun
(I guess) the moon and the stars must have followed along
'Cause I'm here in the cold and the dark until she returns
(Lie because the truth really hurts)
Oh, the universe is crumbling tonight
Oh, and I'm not sure if we can survive
Oh, you left me here with nothing at all
With my back against the wall
The crooks and the priests, they all gather around
They tie up my hands, but they won't hear me out
No I'm not the one, I'm not the one to blame
(They will murder me just the same)
She hung her promises, I took the bait
She sold us out just for fortune and fame
No she's not the one, she's not the one to save
(We're the fools that fell into her game)
Oh, the universe is crumbling tonight
Oh, and I'm not sure if we can survive
Oh, you left me here with nothing at all
With my back against the wall
Oh, the universe is crumbling tonight
Oh, and I'm not sure if we can survive
Oh, you left me here with nothing at all
With my back against the wall
So is this what it takes to separate the craving from the purpose?
Measured by success and not the motives of the heart
And we are crushed beneath the weight of all the pressure that is put on our shoulders but...
We could be honest, confess our weakness
Give up our innocence for the blame
We could be saved...
Oh, the universe is crumbling tonight
Oh, and I'm not sure if we can survive
Oh, you left me here with nothing at all
With my back against the wall
Oh, the universe is crumbling tonight
Oh, and I'm not sure if we can survive
Oh, you left me here with nothing at all
With my back against the wallEmbed
