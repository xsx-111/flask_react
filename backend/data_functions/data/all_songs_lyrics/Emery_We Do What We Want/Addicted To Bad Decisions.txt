Addicted To Bad Decisions LyricsI'm addicted to bad decisions
I just can't ever help myself
(but this is different)
It sounds so convincing...
She's good for you
So good for us as well
You'll be the taste lingering on my lips
It'll be my hands clinging to your hips
I got get get get it out
Gotta get me out
Find the flaw
Find the switch
Just get me down
Wouldn't matter if you couldn't go back
But you never even thought to ask
So I think if you would
Then I think that you should
Remember, remember, remember
(I blame this on a honest year)
We've done this all together
(If you take this down she won't know)
Remember the imposters and pretenders
(You blame this on a modest year)
Together have done this to get her
So go get her
Is it possible to forget your name?
The identity running through your veins?
Was it worth these ends to play this part?
I never thought it could get this far
Vanity only brings in the new
But the sinking ship drowns every person here
Including you
And tell yourself you were wrong when it hurts
But the unoriginal you would have never worked
Oh, you're the lucky one
It's hard to show when the stains bleed through
She's gotta know this was never you
Gotta get get get it out
Gotta get me out
Just can't seem to shut shut shut it down
Although the stains stay same, they just reappear
But I can keep this all up for you, dear
Gotta get get get me out
Gotta get it out
Find the flaw
Find the switch
Just shut it down
Remember, remember, remember
(I blame this on an honest year)
We've done this all to get her
So go get her
Is it possible to forget your name?
The identity running through your veins?
Was it worth the ends to play this part?
I never thought it could get this far
Vanity only brings in the new
But the sinking ship drowns every person here
Including you
Tell yourself it was wrong when it hurts
But the unoriginal you would have never worked
Oh, you're the lucky one
(I've come undone)
You're the lucky one
Someone would love you so much they would come undone
(I've come undone)
Oh, you're the lucky one
I'm addicted to bad decisions
I just can't ever help myself
Always thought I could fix the edges
But I'm torn and there's nothing left
I just can't stand the thought of you this way
So I said the things that I thought would make you stay
But I was wrong. I was wrong
I was wrong
Is it possible to forget your name?
The identity running through your veins?
Was it worth the ends to play this part?
I never thought it could get this far
Vanity only bring in the new
But the sinking ship drowns every person here
Including you
Tell yourself you were wrong when it hurts
But the unoriginal you would have never worked
You're so unoriginal, it would have never workedEmbed
