Fix Me LyricsWe've all got something to say
When we open our mouths we have someone to blame
We all have demons to face
Situations evolve into something we can't explain
It's like a thorn in my mind
Digging deeper and deeper and killing the love that it finds
My hearts a complex machine
When it breaks it takes more
Than the doctors and technology to fix me
Fix me. Can you fix me?
I've been waiting so long to feel this heartbeat
Will we ever really believe?
We're just caught in the thought that we deserve to be free
Love's not a gift to repay
With a handful of money, and words we can say
There is no proper remark to be made that can change
Or determine who we really are
Fix me. Can you fix me?
I've been waiting so long to feel this heartbeat
Will we ever really believe?
We're just caught in the thought that we deserve to be free
Screaming at the top of my lungs
Does it make me understand what you've done?
How could I ever question you?
How could I ever doubt what you do?
Maybe this will tear me apart
But maybe I'll go back to the start
And honestly I can't believe that this is really happening
Fix me. Jesus, fix me
I've been waiting so long to feel this heartbeat
Will we ever really believe?
We're just caught in the thought that we deserve to be free
Fix me. Father, fix me
I've been waiting so long to feel this heartbeat
Will we ever really believe?
We're just caught in the thought that we deserve to be freeEmbed
