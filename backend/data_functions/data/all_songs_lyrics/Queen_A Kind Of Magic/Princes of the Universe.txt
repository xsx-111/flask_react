Princes of the Universe Lyrics
Here we are, born to be kings
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong
Fighting to survive
In a world with the darkest powers, hey!

And here we are
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong, fighting for survival
We've come to be
The rulers of your world

I am immortal, I have inside me
Blood of kings (yeah, yeah)
I have no rival, no man can be my equal
Take me to the future of your world

Born to be kings
Princes of the universe
Fighting and free
Got your world in my hand
I'm here for your love
And I'll make my stand
We were born to be
Princes of the universe
No man could understand
My power is in my own hand
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
People talk about you
People say you've had your day)
I'm a man that will go far
Find the moon and reach for the stars
With my sword and head held high
Got to pass the test first time, yeah
I know that people talk about me
I hear it every day
But I can prove them wrong
'Cause I'm right first time

Yeah, yeah, alright
Let's go, let's go, ha-ha!
Yeah, watch this man fly, whoo!
Bring on the girls

Here we are, here we are
Born to be kings
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong
Born to be kings
Princes of the universe
Fighting and free
Got the world in my hands
I'm here for your love
And I'll make my stand
We were born to be
Princes of the universe
(Universe, universe, universe)7Embed
