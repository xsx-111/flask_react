Pain Is So Close to Pleasure Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Everybody knows
One day we're loving each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time

When I was young
And just getting started
And people talked to me
They sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my 'magination
And all I wanted
Was to start a new relation
So in love, but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for
Some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed
Was some love and affection
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure

Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong
And you turn out the light
But inside of your mind
You put up a fight

Where are the answers
That we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world
To be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good
Some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love
Wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse
So let's make the best
Of the rest of our years
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life

All your life, ooh
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure4Embed
