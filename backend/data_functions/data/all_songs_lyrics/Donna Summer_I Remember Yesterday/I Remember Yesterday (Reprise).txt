I Remember Yesterday (Reprise) LyricsI remember yesterday...
I remember that first night we met
Dancing to the sounds of clarinets
Dancing cheek to cheek, oh how sweet
You and me and this fantasy
Oh i remember our first night
I remember how we carried on
On and on until the light of dawn
From the very start, you stole my heart
I knew right then we would never part
Oh i remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night
Remember that first night
I saw your lovelight through the candle's glow
Champagne was flowing, and so i let myself go
And when the night was over
We both looked around the room
Remember darling, chairs on the table
And only me and you
I remember how we carried on
On and on until the light of dawn
And from the very start, you stole my heart
I knew right then we would never part
I remember that first nightEmbed
