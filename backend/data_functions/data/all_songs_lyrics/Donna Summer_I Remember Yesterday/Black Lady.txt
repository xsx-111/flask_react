Black Lady LyricsIt was bad, really mean
She had the kind of reputation to make any woman scream
Late one night, when it wasn't right
And he made a catch, and he meets his match
Black lady, black lady
She was mean, really bad
She was slender as a cat at night, she made the men go mad
Well her eyes were green, and her skin was soft
And the lady's heart was as hard as rock
Black lady, black lady
You better beware, you better beware, you better beware
He tried to fight it, tried to win
But no matter where the poor man turned, the lady halted him
Her wish was his command, his life in her hands
And the death was slow, 'cause she won't let go
Oh, Black lady, that black lady
She tried to win, tried to buy
She was out over him, 'cause he played all the cards just right
He laid out his hand like a winning man
With a smile so deep, she put him into a sleep
You know she won
Black lady, black lady
You better beware, you better beware
Black lady, you better beware
Black lady, black lady, black ladyEmbed
