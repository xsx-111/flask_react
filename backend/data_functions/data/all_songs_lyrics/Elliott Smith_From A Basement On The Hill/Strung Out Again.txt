Strung Out Again Lyrics
You get what you see
I saw a rich fuck given charity
Saw an evil emperor
Wearing my clothes
They're far from the best
But they might suit you better than the rest
Just looking in the mirror
Will make you a brave man

I know my place
Hate my face
I know how I begin
And how I'll end
Strung out again

Was a parliament of owls
Fly over a city of canals
Floating on the body
Floating in the Dalles
You get what you see
But some things they just change invisibly
I don't know where I'm going
And I don't even want to know
I know my place
Hate my face
I know how I begin
And how I'll end
Strung out again

Standing, smiling
On some fantasy island
Looking at my lost reflection again
But a tide's coming in
And I'm strung out again
Strung out again2Embed
