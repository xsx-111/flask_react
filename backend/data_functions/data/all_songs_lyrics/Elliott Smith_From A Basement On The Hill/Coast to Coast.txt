Coast to Coast Lyrics(Pushy preacher)
Last stop for a resolution
End of the line, into confusion
So go, go see what's there for you
Nothing new
Nothing new for you to use
I've got no new act to amuse you
I've got no desire to use you, no
But anything that I could do
Would never be good enough for you
If you can't help it, then just leave it alone (leave it alone)
Leave it alone
Yeah, just forget it
It's really easy
I believe I'll forget it too
Still you're keeping me around
'Til I finally drag us both down (Gonna drag us both down)
Pulling feathers out your hat (Throwing feathers out your hat)
Yes, I believe it's come to that (I believe that's where it's at)
You belong tagging along
And I belong in the zoo
So I wait for confirmation
That you're never gonna use your starting gun
Unless he's me, it sounds like (sounds like)
Being him just wasn't that much fun
Anything that I could do
Would never be good enough for you
If you can't help it then just leave it alone
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Yeah, just forget it
It's really easy, I'll just forget it too
Coast to coast (Coast to coast)
Coast to coast (Coast to coast)
I'll do what I can so you can be what you do
Coast to coast (Coast to coast)
Coast to coast (Coast to coast)
I'll do everything I can so you can be what you do
Coast to coast
Coast to coast
Circuit rider comes every fifth Sunday
Oh my lord, I fell asleep one day
Anything that I could do
Is there anything that I could do
That someone doesn't do for you (It's never good enough for you)
That someone didn't do for you (That someone doesn't do for you)
That I've already done for you

That's why2Embed
