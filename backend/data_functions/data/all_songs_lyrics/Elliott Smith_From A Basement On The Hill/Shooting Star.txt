Shooting Star Lyrics
You'll make the scene
Like you always do
Going upstream
Down the avenue
To fuck some trophy boy
That you'll win tonight at the bar

So bad, so far
You'll make him sad
Shooting star

When it was me
I was momentarily proud
Drunk on dreams
Now I'm glad I didn't say out loud
You said you'd be for real
But I don't believe that you are

So bad, so far
You made me sad
Shooting star
You're distant and cold
And a sight to behold
Everybody just sighs
But no one gets on
With you very long
Cause you don't feel bad when you lie

I'm going to sleep now
Going back to find square one
Square to be where
I can deal with the shit you just done
It won't be soon
Say the least it's gonna be hard

So bad, so far
Your love is sad
Shooting star
Your love is sad
