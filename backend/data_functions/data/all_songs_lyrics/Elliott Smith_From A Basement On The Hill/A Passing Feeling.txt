A Passing Feeling Lyrics
Everything is gone but the echo of the burst of the shell
And I'm stuck here waiting
For a passing feeling
In the city I built up and blew to hell
I'm stuck here waiting
For a passing feeling

Still I send all the time
My request for relief
Down the dead power line
Though I'm beyond belief
In the help I require
Just to exist at all
Took a long time to stand
Took an hour to fall

I'm stuck here waiting
For a passing feeling
Stuck here waiting
For a passing feeling
Still I send all the time
My request for relief
Down the dead power line
Though I'm beyond belief
In the help I require
Just to exist at all
Took a long time to stand
Took an hour to fall4Embed
