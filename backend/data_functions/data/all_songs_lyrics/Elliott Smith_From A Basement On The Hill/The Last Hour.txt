The Last Hour Lyrics
Here's the army that you mowed to the ground
And the bodies you left lying around
Talking it out
The last hour
I'm through trying now
It's a big relief
I'll be staying down
Where no one else gonna give me grief

Mess me around
Just make it over

Your opinion was the law of the land
The single thing that I could always understand
I lived it out from hour to hour
The only thing that never really changed
You ran me all around
And dragged me down
At the end of the day

Don't keep me around
Just make it over
I've been thinking of the things that I missed
Situations that I passed up for this
One-way love I took for hours
I'm through trying now
It's a big relief
I'll be staying down
I wasn't good at being a thief

More like a clown
Make it over4Embed
