Pretty (Ugly Before) Lyrics
Sunshine
Been keeping me up for days
There is no nighttime
It's only a passing phase

And I feel pretty
Pretty enough for you
I felt so ugly before
I didn't know what to do

Sometimes
Is all I feel up to now
But it's not worth it to you
'Cause you gotta get high somehow

Is it destruction that you require to feel
Like somebody wants you
Someone that's more for real

Sunshine
Been keeping me up for days
There is no nighttime
Only a passing phase
And I'll feel pretty
Another hour or two
I felt so ugly before
(Ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
I felt so ugly before
(Ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
I felt so ugly before
(Ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
Ugly before
(Ugly before)Embed
