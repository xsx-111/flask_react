Memory Lane Lyrics
This is the place you end up
When you lose the chase
Where you’re dragged against your will
From a basement on the hill
And all anybody knows
Is you're not like them
And they kick you in the head
And send you back to bed

Isolation
Pulled you passed
A tunnel to a bright
World where you can
Make a place to stay
But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane

The mayor's name is fear
His force patrols the pier
From a mountain of cliché
That advances everyday
The doctor spoke a cloud
He rained out loud
You’ll keep your doors and windows shut
And swear you'll never show a soul again but

Isolation
Pushes you ‘til
Every muscle aches
Down the only road
It ever takes
But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane

If it's your decision
To be open about yourself
Be careful or else
Be careful or else

Uncomfortable apart
It's all written on my chart
And I take what's given to me
Most cooperatively
I do what people say
And lie in bed all day
Absolutely horrified
I hope you're satisfied

Isolation
Pushes past self-hatred
Guilt and shame
To a place where suffering is
Just a game
But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane
Your little house on memory lane2Embed
