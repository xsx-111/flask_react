A Distorted Reality is Now a Necessity to be Free LyricsI'm floating in a black balloon
O.D. on Easter afternoon
My mama told me "Baby stay clean
There's no in-between"
And all you ladies and you gentlemen
Between is all you've ever seen or been
Fit poorly and arrange the sight
Doll it up in virgin white
You disappoint me, you people raking in on the world
The devil's script sells you the heart of a blackbird
Shine on me baby, because it's raining in my heart
Sun's rising on a chopping glare
Rain dropping acid bought up in the air
A distorted reality is now a necessity to be free
It's so disappointing
First I put it all down to luck
God knows why my country don't give a fuck
Fuck
Shine on me baby, because it's raining in my heart
Shine on me baby, because it's raining in my heart2Embed
