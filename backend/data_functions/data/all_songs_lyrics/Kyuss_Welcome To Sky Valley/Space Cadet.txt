Space Cadet Lyrics
I stand alone on the cliffs of the world
No one ever tends to me
Sitting alone, covered in rays
Some things are so my mind can breathe

The waiting is hard
Fuckin' takes so long
Draped in sun, hands in sand
Earth acid cleanses me
It cleanses me clean
But the world, it never comes
It never comes
It never comes
It never comes

I lay on my side in the edge of the room
She never expects anything from me
Where were all the days, the days of the year?
I know I miss that part of me

The waiting is hard
Fuckin' takes so long
Draped in sun, hands in sand
Earth acid cleanses me
It cleanses me clean
But the world, it never comes
It never comes
It never comes
It never comes
It never comes
It never comes8Embed
