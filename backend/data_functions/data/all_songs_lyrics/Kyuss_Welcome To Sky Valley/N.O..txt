N.O. Lyrics
I wake up tomorrow today
Just help me find my head
I could be dead

Where to go, what to say
When you're crossin' my line
Oh, give me time, give me time
Oh, just like they said

I live my life alone
Never going home
Just like they said
It's just a song to sing, it's just a song to sing

I wake up tomorrow today
Just help me find my head
I could be dead

Where to go, what to say
When you're crossin' my line
Oh, give me time, give me time
Oh, just like they said
I live my life alone
Never going home
Just like they said
It's just a song to sing, it's just a song to sing

Give me love, give me love
Give me love
Well, just like they saidEmbed
