Odyssey Lyrics
Take one to the mountain
Take one to the sea
Take one to the belly of the beast
And then you'll take one with me

Shut it
Shut it

Freezing in the fires
Well, I oughta howl your name
Once you return from the belly of the beast
You're never quite the same

Shut it
Shut it on
Shut it
Shut it on

Fire on the mountain
And it rages out of control
The fire inside the belly of the beast
Well it burns, then wraps your soul
Shut it
Shut it on
Shut it
Shut it onEmbed
