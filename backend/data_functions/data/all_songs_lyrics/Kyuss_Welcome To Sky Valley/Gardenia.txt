Gardenia Lyrics
One blow till I'll take ya down, I'll take ya down
One smoke and your head spins around and around
Chrome mags, a million drags, it never lags
An old transport queen mama, you never seen

Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a-burnin' fuel
Push it over, baby
We're makin' love unto you

Power booster, I'm talkin' to God and more
Crank it up and above my head
Smell my shit eating grin on the skin of my world
Six hundred sixty six miles per hour

Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a-burnin' fuel
Push it over, baby
We're makin' love

Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a burnin' fuel, oh they were burnin'
Push it over, baby
We're makin' love unto you
Makin' love unto you, making

Get back, get back a-rollin'
Get back, get back a-rollin'
Get back, get back a-rollin'
Get back, get back motherfucker
Get back, get back a-rollin'
Get back, get back motherfucker
Get back, get back motherfucker
Motherfucker
