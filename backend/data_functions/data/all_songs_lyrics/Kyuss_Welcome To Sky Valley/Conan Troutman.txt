Conan Troutman Lyrics
Feed my lung, flower seed
You are gone and now I'm free (I'm free, yeah)
Strip me down to nothing
Thought we would free the vulture (Make it fly)

Burning my brain and burning my teeth (Into the sun)
A hundred degrees and burning my need (Make it fly)
Live the love that I have for you
Taking your life from off you (Free)Embed
