Whitewater Lyrics
Oh sunshine
The loving beauty
Pass me by
Should I waste my time
In your valley
Beneath your sky?

Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
I am home

You move your own mountain
The trees have grown
The trees have grown
Now it's over
Now it's over and I'm coming home

Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
Aah, aah
I am homeEmbed
