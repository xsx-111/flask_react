Demon Cleaner Lyrics
I've got the demons in me
I've got to brush them all away
I feel the demons rage
I must clean them all away

Yeah (Yeah)

Inside I see more
Cobwebs in the way
The magic cleaner will
Shine his smile over me

Yeah (Yeah)

I am the demon
Cleaner to save the day
I get the back one
Important they'll always stay

Yeah (Yeah)
If only one thing that you'll know
Impostors from the show
They'll try to trick you into
Normal treatment
Oh don't you listen to them say
Shush them all away

I am the demon cleaner
Madman of Encino
I am the the freedom bleeder
Standing naked here to say

I'm the only way
I'm the only way
I'm the only way
I'm the only way1Embed
