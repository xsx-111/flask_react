Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop Lyrics
Don't try to take me away
Like I can't live without you
Today, makin' love tomorrow
Some way, swoopin', you're so fragile
Died today, you disgrace the mortal

Fight me lately, tied to someone
We've been laughing since you've been gone
And I want to know
Did you all enjoy the show?
It's so sad to see you go

And you know
You're my home
You alone
Who's on his own

Hanging low today
I replace the highway
Love's the only way
Linking hands the wrong way
So I'd better see you go
It's so sad to see you go
I just thought I'd let you know
And you know!
You're my home!
Alone!
Who's on his own!2Embed
