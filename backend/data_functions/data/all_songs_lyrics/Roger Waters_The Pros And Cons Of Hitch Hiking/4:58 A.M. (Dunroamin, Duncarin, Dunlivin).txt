4:58 A.M. (Dunroamin, Duncarin, Dunlivin) LyricsTruckdriver: "Hey kid, you looking for a lift?...Get on up here
How's it going good buddy?

I nailed ducks to the wall
Kept my heart in dark ruins
I built bungalows all over the hills
Dunroamin, duncarin, dunlivin
Took my girl to the country
To sleep out under the moon
Next thing she's going crazy
 Women are like that kid, what the hell can you do?
She waits for the real Mr. Right to come
Gently removing her heart
With his promises of real communication
Trucker: "I saw a program about that on TV..."
Who's always picking up the tab
Who built a bungalow for his mum and dad - me
Who took you out to all the shows
Who worked his fingers to the bone - me
While you were asleep
Man: "It was me... I did"
I kept you in buttons and bows
Man: "Christ all those clothes
So you could encourage this creep
With his neat feet
And his clean fingernails
With his wise but twinkling eyes
He's a rock standing out in an ocean of doubt
Trucker: "Get moving, get off the road ya Goddamn faggot"
And compromise
I'd like to go on with this bit of the song
Describing this schmuck
I'd like to go on
But I'm gonna throw up
Trucker: "Not in my rig you don't boy... get the hell out of hereEmbed
