4:37 A.M. (Arabs with Knives and West German Skies) Lyrics
Sleep, sleep, I know that I'm only dreaming
(Leave her alone... Get out... Out... Get out of my house)
Through closed eyes I see West German skies on the ceiling
And I want to get back
To the girl with the rucksack
To feel her flaxen hair
I want to be there
See the sun going down
Behind Krupps Steelworks
On the outskirts of some German town

Guten Abend, meine Damen und Herren, ha, ha, ha, ha!
(La, la, la, la, la-la)
Willkommen in KÃ¶nigsberg, ha, ha, ha, ha!
(La, la, la, la, la-la)
Wollen Sie tanzen mit mir, oder trinken Bier, ha, ha, ha, ha?

Thank you, but...
This young lady and I
Will just finish this bottle of wine
It was kind of you but
I think we'll just say goodnight (Leave us alone)
Goodnight (Leave us alone)
"Could I have the keys to 1 4 3 please?"
"There you are"
"Thank you, goodnight"
"Hello, yes, I'd like to order breakfast please"
"I'd like coffee for two and toast with marmalade, no, marmalade"Embed
