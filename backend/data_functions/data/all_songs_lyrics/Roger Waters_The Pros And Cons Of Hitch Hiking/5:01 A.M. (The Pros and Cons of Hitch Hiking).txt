5:01 A.M. (The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking) Lyrics

An angel on a Harley
Pulls across to greet a fellow rolling stone
(Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo)
Puts his bike up on its stand
Leans back and then extends
A scarred and greasy hand, he said
"How ya doin' bro? Where ya been? Where ya goin'?"

Then he takes your hand
In some strange Californian handshake
And breaks the bone (Ooh...)
Have a nice day, haha
(Aaah!)

A housewife from Encino
Whose husband's on the golf course
With his book (Hah!) of rules
(Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo)
Brakes and makes a 'U' and idles back
To take a second look at you
You flex your rod (You flex your rod)
Fish takes the hook (Ha!)
Sweet vodka and tobacco in her breath (Ooh...)
Another number in your little black book

These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
Oh babe, I must be dreaming

I was standing on the leading edge
The Eastern seaboard spread before my eyes
"Jump", said Yoko Ono
"I'm too scared and too good looking", I cried

"Go on", she says
"Why don't you give it a try?
Why prolong the agony
All men must die"


Do you remember Dick Tracy?
Do you remember Shane?
And mother wants you
(Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo)
Could you see him selling tickets
Where the buzzard circles over
Shane
"The body on the plain"
Did you understand the music, Yoko
Or was it all in vain?
"Shane!"
The bitch said something mystical
Herro
So I stepped back on the curb again, wooh

These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
Oh babe, I must be dreaming again

These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking
These are the pros and cons of hitchhiking3Embed
