5:11 A.M. (The Moment of Clarity) Lyrics
Then the moment of clarity
Faded like charity does
Sometimes

I opened one eye
And I put out my hand just to touch your soft hair
To make sure in the darkness that you were still there
And I have to admit
I was just a little afraid

Ooh, yeah
But then...

I had a little bit of luck
You were awake
I couldn't take another moment aloneEmbed
