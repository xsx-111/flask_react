4:56 A.M. (For the First Time Today, Part 1) Lyrics
For the first time today
I feel it's really over
You were my everyday excuse
For playing deaf, dumb and blind

Who'd have ever thought
This was how it would end for you and me
To carry my own millstone
Out of the trees

And I have to admit
I don't like it a bit
Being left here beside this lonesome road

Lonesome road
Lonesome roadEmbed
