4:47 A.M. (The Remains of Our Love) Lyrics
I just cowered in the corner
My pajama coat over my head
And she smiled as she finished her sandwich
And her cold eyes fixed me to my dark history
As she brushed the remains
Of our love from the bed

And when she had turned back the covers
When all of the prayers had been read
She says:
"Come on over here you silly boy
Before you catch your death of cold
I was only joking
Let's leave behind the city grime
Let's not compete
It could be fine in the country
Couldn't it though
Come on let's go"
I said: "Okay."
 Are we going to go now?
 Where would you like to go darling?
 Mmm...Vermont...Wyoming (yes)
 Wyoming...uh huh, Children!
 What?
 We're going to Wyoming
Darling...Which way is Wyoming?
 Hook a right here
You're going the wrong way
 I know that
I know children...
Let's see how many Volvos we pass
On the way to our new life in the country
...One
 Jade don't do that, that's really negative1Embed
