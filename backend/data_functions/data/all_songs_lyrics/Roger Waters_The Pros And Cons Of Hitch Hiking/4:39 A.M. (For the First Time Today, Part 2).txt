4:39 A.M. (For the First Time Today, Part 2) Lyrics
For the first time today
I held her naked body next to mine
In this hotel overlooking the Rhine
I made her mine

Ooh babe (Ooh babe)
Oooooh babe
Ooh
Come with me and stay with me
Please stay with me
Stay with me
 "Uh...what is it?"
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
 No...

Stay with me
 Forget it...1Embed
