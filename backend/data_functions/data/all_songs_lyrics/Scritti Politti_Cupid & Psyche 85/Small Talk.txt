Small Talk Lyrics
Small talk
Small talk
Small talk

Ooh, we're tired of prophesying
We heard the word was good, but it's stupefying
Small talk
Get up and do some death defying
Small talk

I heard a whisper
That careless talk costs more than you bargained for
In seventh heaven if a thing's worth doing it's worth doing badly, baby
Small talk

Small talk, oh baby it's so inconsequential
Everybody heard enough about your big potential
Small talk, oh no information given
Small talk

I heard a whisper
That careless talk costs more than you bargained for
In seventh heaven if a thing's worth doing it's worth doing badly, baby
Small talk, oh well you're such a little socialite
We heard your chit chat, now you get it up and get it right
Small talk, oh show us what you're made of baby
Small talk

I heard a whisper
That careless talk costs more than you bargained for
In seventh heaven if a thing's worth doing it's worth doing badly, babyEmbed
