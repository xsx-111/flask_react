Lover To Fall LyricsHard that I'm gonna hear about you, oh about you, baby I do
Hard that I'm gonna be without you, oh without you, baby I do
I stand to lose if I love you, you stand to gain
We stand for all who believe in vain
Let's fall in love n' be glad to get it over, oh I'm over baby for you
Call him and tell him that it's over, oh it's over baby it's through
I got the time that you left me, you got the keys to his car
We've got the nerve to have got this far (far, far)
I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby it's true
I'm gonna be the lover to fall for you
I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby it's true
I'm gonna be the lover to fall for you
I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby it's true
I'm gonna be the lover oh I'm gonna be the lover
Heard you're the heroine of virtue ,oh I heard it, baby it's true
Heard how your honesty had hurt you, oh I heard it, baby it's true
I found a new hermeneutic, I found a new paradigm
I found a plan just to make you mine (mine, mine)
An' now I know that I need you to be near me oh near me baby you do
Know that I need you girl to hear me c'mon and hear me baby I do
Come back n' give me a reason come back 'n take me away
Come back n' mean all the things you say (say, say)
I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby it's true
I'm gonna be the lover to fall for you
I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby your kiss
There's gonna be a day when the rich get this
I'm tellin' you baby 'cos baby it's true
I'm gonna be the lover oh I'm gonna be the lover
Heard you're the heroine of virtue, oh I heard it, baby it's true
Heard how your honesty had hurt you, oh I heard it, baby it's true
Know that I need you to be near me oh mear me baby you do
Know that I need you girl to hear me oh you hear me baby I do
Love n' be glad to get it over, oh I'm over baby for youEmbed
