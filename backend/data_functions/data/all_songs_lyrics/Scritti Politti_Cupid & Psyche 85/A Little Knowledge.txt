A Little Knowledge LyricsGREEN: Now I know to love you
FEMALE: Is not to know you
GREEN: Oh I got too near to you
Oh, in the court of contempt -
I have to tell you
FEMALE: One thing I'm certain
GREEN: I've been overtaken, girl
Oh, by the need to be loved
We don't have forever
FEMALE: To find a reason
GREEN: How I lost the will to love you
Out in the way of the world
Maybe I could see you
FEMALE: When this is over
GREEN: Maybe when our hearts are healed
Oh what a day to behold
BOTH: There'll be a day, lovers away
(You can) call me and mend a broken heart
There'll be a time long after mine
(He will) call you and mend a broken heart
GREEN: Not a lot to say now
FEMALE: Except I miss you
GREEN: Not a lot to take your place
Oh, in the heart of the boy
Ooh a little knowledge
FEMALE: Is so exciting
GREEN: You became a part of me
Oh, and the world that we knew
I guess it's a sickness
FEMALE: That keeps me wanting
GREEN: Ate away the heart of me (heart of me)
Oh, and the heart that I loved
Still beyond believing
FEMALE: In love forever
GREEN: Quite the brightest star, girl
Oh, in the reason of sleep
FEMALE: There'll be a day, lovers away
(You can) call me BOTH: and mend a broken heart
There'll be a time long after mine
(He will) call you BOTH: and mend a broken heart
GREEN: Listen to her say
FEMALE: Got a little radio
Held to my body
I can feel your back beat boy
GREEN: Moving a muscle of love
FEMALE: Turn it up and press it
I don't understand it
I can feel your message boy
GREEN: Calling me over and out
Here's a verse for nothing
FEMALE: An introduction
GREEN: To the way the world will be
Now we're apart and alone
Mustn't be unhappy
FEMALE: When you remember
GREEN: Lovers never lose each other
Oh, such a lot to be learnedEmbed
