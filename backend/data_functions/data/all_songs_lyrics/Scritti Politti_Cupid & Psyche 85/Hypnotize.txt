Hypnotize LyricsHypnotize - call me up when you thought of somethin' new for me to do girl
Hypnotize - call me up when you thought of somethin' new for me to do girl
How could your nothings be so sweet?
You left your love letters incomplete
Ooh what a girl got nothin' to do
Mmm but she got that much for you
Ooh what the girl been puttin' you thru
Mmm but she she got that much for you
Down on the beach and out in the bay
Ooh but I heard the sirens say
You better believe her, or you better leave her, now or never
Hypnotize - how do you come to be having fun with everyone but me girl?
Forgot to tell me something good
You, a word, knew you would
Hypnotize - how do you come to be havin' fun with everyone but me girl?
How could your nothings be so sweet?
You left your love letters incomplete
Ooh what a girl got nothin' to do
Mmm but she got that much for you
Ooh what the girl been puttin' you thru'
Mmm but she got that much for you
Out on the street and Avenue A
Ooh but I heard the sirens say
You better believe her or you better leave her now or never
In your eyes - wanna tell you that your heart keeps rockin'
In your eyes - wanna tell you that your heart keeps rockin'
In your eyes - wanna tell you that your heart keeps rockin'
Hypnotize - I forget to believe in heaven when I look at you girl
How could your nothings be so sweet?
You left your love letters incomplete
Ooh what a girl got nothin' to do
Mmm but she got that much for you
Ooh what the girl been puttin' you thru
Mmm but she got that much for you
Out on the street and Avenue A
Ooh but I heard the sirens say
Oh yeah, but it's so hard to tell ya
That I love you girl
Mmm baby
Oh it's so hard to tell ya
That I love you girl
Mmm babyEmbed
