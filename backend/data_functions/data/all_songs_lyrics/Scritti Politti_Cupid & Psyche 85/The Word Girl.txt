The Word Girl Lyrics
To do what I should do, to long for you to hear
I open up my heart and watch her name appear
A word for you to use, a girl without a cause
A name for what you lose when it was never yours

The first time, baby, that I came to you
I'd do things that you want me to
The second time, baby, that I came to you
Oh, you found my love for you
The third time, baby, that I came to you
Oh, oh, oh, I knew
The last time, baby, that I came to you
Oh, how your flesh and blood became the word

A name the girl outgrew, the girl was never real
She stands for your abuse, the girl is no ideal
It's a word for what you do in a world of broken rules
She found a place for you along her chain of fools

The first time, baby, that I came to you
I'd do things that you want me to
The second time, baby, that I came to you
Oh, you found my love for you
The third time, baby, that I came to you
Oh, oh, oh, I knew
The last time, baby, that I came to you
Oh, how your flesh and blood became the word
Oh how your flesh and blood
Oh how your flesh and blood
Oh how your flesh and blood
Oh how your flesh and blood
Oh how your flesh and blood
Oh how your flesh and blood
Oh how your flesh and blood

Oh how
Oh how
Oh howEmbed
