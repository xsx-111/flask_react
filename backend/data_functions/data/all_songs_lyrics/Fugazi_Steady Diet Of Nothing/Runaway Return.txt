Runaway Return LyricsOut of the ashtray
Into the ashtray
Out of the ashtray
Out of the ashtray
Into the ashtray
Out of the ashtray
There's nothing living
There's nothing given
Weekender's vision
Turns to working shoes
There's nothing living
Here's nothing given
Weekender gives in
Puts on his working suit
There's nothing waiting
There's nothing imminent
Nothing forgiven
For the young idea
There's nothing waiting
There's nothing imminent
Nobody seems surprised
The runaway returns
Home, son
...doing
...gone

Welcome home, misplaced son
Guess what we we're doing while you were gone
Cocktail party's in gear
We're glad that you're here
Why don't you sit down?
Out of the ashtray
Into the ashtray
Out of the ashtray
Into the family car
Out of the ashtray
Into the ashtray
Out of the ashtray
Into the family's arms
There's nothing waiting
There's nothing imminent
Nothing forgiven
To your young idea
There's nothing waiting
There's nothing imminent
Seems like you've been misused
The runaway returns
Home, son
...doing
...gone

Welcome home, misplaced son
Guess just what we we're doing while you were gone
Party's in gear
We're just so glad that you're here
Why don't you sit down?
Welcome back
Out of the ashtray
Into the ashtray
Out of the ashtray
Out of the ashtray
Into the ashtray
Out of the ashtrayEmbed
