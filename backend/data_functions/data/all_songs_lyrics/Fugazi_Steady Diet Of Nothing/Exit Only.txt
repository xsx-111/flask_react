Exit Only LyricsExeunt, exeunt
Exeunt, exeunt

Exeunt, exeunt
Exeunt, exeunt
Exeunt, exeunt
Exeunt, exeunt
Exeunt, exeunt
This is three minute access
So pop the question
Leave the last place burning?
Or do we just get leaving?
Red-light my mind
Refuse your filter
Are you still surprised?
I keep my back
Above the tire tracks
Exeunt, don't ask me
Exeunt, don't ask me
Exeunt, don't ask me
Exeunt, exeunt
Three minute access
So pop the question
Last place burning?
Or just get leaving?
Red-light my mind
Refuse that filter
Are you still surprised?
Keep my back
Above the tire tracks
