Dear Justice Letter LyricsJustice Brennan
Take out some insurance on me
Uh, baby
Uh, baby, it's just
It's like I, like I said
I'm over  busted and dripping
It's like I, like I said
My sorry lungs are all leaking
It's like I, like I said
It's all over
It's like I, like I said
It's all over I said
The last fair deal going down
You let your gown to the ground
I'm not waiting around until the kiss-off
Wasn't it you who said, yeah you can shoot me lightly
Ask me to be excused, I won't go die politely
Any time that you want you can shoot me lightly
Ask me to be excused, I won't go die politely
Justice Brennan
I know it's not your fault
No baby
No baby, it's just
It's like I, like I said
You're over  busted and dripping
It's like I, like I said
Your sorry lungs are all leaking
It's like I, like I said
It's not over
It's like I, like I said
It's not over, I said
The last fair deal going down
You let your gown to the ground
I'm waiting around until the kiss-off
Wasn't it you who said, yeah you can shoot me lightly
Ask me to be excused, I won't go die politely
Any time that you want you can shoot me lightly
Ask me to be excused, I won't go die politely
Here comes the kiss-off
Justice Brennan
Justice Brennan
Justice Brennan
Justice Brennan, yeahEmbed
