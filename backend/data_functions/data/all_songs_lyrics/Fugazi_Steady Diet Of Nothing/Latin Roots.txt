Latin Roots Lyrics
Lying on our backs
This is your parents' bed
A good place to be laid
'Cause it's so neatly made

Staring at the ceiling
Vein-to-vein, the lines look the same
As the ones that you're seeing
And then you start speaking

Tracing your father's footsteps
In your mother's shoes
Going up and over
And across all your Latin roots
Your Latin roots
Your Latin roots
Your Latin roots
Yeah

Point points back to its origin
Across the world, cogs are clogged with the sand
Here, the air breathes freely
And our tongues work loosely
Border approaches border
You're using your hands and smearing your R's
I'm looking over my shoulder
Strained resistance to scour the door for

Your father's footsteps
Or your mother's shoes
Coming up and over
Cut across all your Latin roots
Your Latin roots
Your Latin roots
Your Latin roots
Yeah


It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
Wow
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makers
It's time to meet your makersEmbed
