Nice New Outfit Lyrics
You like the cut, you like the fit
Wide in the shoulders, trim at the hips

In your nice, new outfit
All straight, clean lines
There's blood in your mouth
But not in mine

You think that I'm a sucker for it
That we're all fodder for this
Quick purchase once brought to market
Dress it up and it's sold

The place I'm offered is a bedsitter's tour
A worthless sightsee of your adventure

In your nice, new outfit
All straight, clean lines
There's blood in your mouth
Dressed to the nines
You think that I'm a sucker for it
That we're all fodder for this
Quick purchase once brought to market
Dress it up and it's sold


You're number one with a bullet
That's money well spent
Your mouth plastered like poster
Address yourself, success
You can pinpoint your chimney
And drop one down its length
In your nice, new outfit
Sorry 'bout the mess
In your nice, new outfit
Ooh, sorry 'bout the mess
In your nice, new outfit
Sorry 'bout the mess
In your nice, new outfit
You're a fucking messEmbed
