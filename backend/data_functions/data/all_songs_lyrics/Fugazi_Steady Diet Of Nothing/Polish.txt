Polish Lyrics
Got with the program
Swallowed it whole
Sugar made it easy
Ice made it cold
Made it cold

Reached out and touched them
On a TV screen
Broke out the polish
Scrubbed it clean
Scrubbed it clean
That dirty machine

This is your portion, please don't share
The only answer, your only prayer
Your reflection, please don't stare

Nothing is going on in

There is your manner, what you wear
Your diseases, your repairs
All your belongings, please don't share
Nothing is going on in there

Update the cleanser
Never mind the stain
We'll take the package
Let the contents remain
Contents remain
As yet unnamed

This is your portion, please don't share
The only answer, your only prayer
Your reflection, please don't stare

Nothing is going on in

There is your manner, what you wear
Your diseases and your repairs
All your belongings, please don't share

Nothing is going on in there
Going on in there
Going on in there
Nothing
Came home, flat busted
Only to be saved
Everything comes down to you in a world
Concave
Concave
So well behaved
So well behaved
We still turn on
Thirty minutes long
We still turn onEmbed
