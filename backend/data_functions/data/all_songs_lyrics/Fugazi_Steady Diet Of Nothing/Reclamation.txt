Reclamation LyricsThese are our demands:
We want control of our bodies
Decisions will now be ours
You can carry out
Your noble actions
We will carry our noble scars
Scars, scars, scars
Reclamation
Reclamation
Reclamation
Reclamation
No one here is asking
No one here is asking
But there is a question of trust
You will do what looks good to you on paper
We will do what we must
Must, must, must
Return, return, return
Return, return, return
Carry my body
Carry my body
Carry my body
Carry my body
Carry my body
Carry my body
Carry my body
Carry my bodyEmbed
