Long Division Lyrics
It's a long time coming
It's a long way down
It's long division
Crack and divide
This is a parting
Some separation
We lay in pieces
Cracked to survive

I'm not your villain
Not your adversary
I'm not your reason
To crack and divide
It's long division
It's long division
It's long division
Crack and divideEmbed
