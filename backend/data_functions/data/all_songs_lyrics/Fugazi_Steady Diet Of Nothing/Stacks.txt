Stacks LyricsThis time is real
I feel it passing through the telephone
No one is home now
No one is home
These stacks
They keep me down
So I build some more
America is just a word but I use it
But I use it
But I use it
But I use it
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
This time is real
I see it passing by the avenue
Nothing to do now
There's nothing to do
I see them spinning on
So I spin out
America is just a word but I use it
But I use it
But I use it
But I use it
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
Language keeps me
Locked and repeating
I put in
(Let it out)
