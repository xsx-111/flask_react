X LyricsWe are powerful creators
Whether we know it or we do not
We win without trying
We win while we are dying
Mommy's tears fall and still we win
How do they do it?
Must be the devil himself
But angels can look like devils
If caught up in an evil gaze
Do not be afraid
Be a man
Every day, I get a little stronger
Stronger than you
Do not be surprised
The chickens have come home to roostEmbed
