Hard Life LyricsIt's a hard life, fight against the weak
It's a hard life, threatened by our freedom
Be on your way
Things are gonna change
It's a hard life, fighting to be seen
It's a hard life, we were born to lead
Oh, be on your way
Things are gonna change
Ooh
Ooh
I ain't gonna wait no more
Gonna start a war
I ain't gonna wait no more
It's a hard life (Life, life, life), fight against the weak
It's a hard life (Life, life, life), threatened by our freedom
Be on your way (Way, way)
Things are gonna change (Change, change, change)
It's a hard life (Life, life, life), fighting to be seen
It's a hard life (Life, life, life), we were born to lead
Oh, be on your way (Way, way)
Things are gonna change (Change, change, change)
Finally, we've— (Life, life, life)
Finally, we've reached (Life, life, life)
Reached the end
Finally, we've reached
(Wait, wait, wait)
Finally, we've reached
Reached the end (Woo)
Finally, we've reached
It's a hard life (Life, life, life), fighting to be seen
It's a hard life, we were born to lead
Oh, be on your way (Way, way)
Things are gonna change
Finally, we've reached the end
(Finally, we've reached the end)
Finally, we've reached the end
(Finally, we've reached the end)
Finally, we've reached the end
(Finally, we've reached the end)
Finally, we've reached the end
(Finally, we've reached the end)
Finally, we've reached the end
(Finally, we've reached the end)
Finally, we've reached the end
(Finally, we've reached the end)
Finally, we've reached the end
(Finally, we've reached the end)
Finally, we've reached the end
(Finally, we've reached the end)
Every day feels like a battle
Battle of the self, battle of the mind
Just try to be kind to yourself
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We rise (We rise, we rise)
Everything is gonna be alright because God is, God is on your side
Everything is gonna be alright because God is, God is on your side
Everything is gonna be alright because God is, God is on your side
Everything is gonna be alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alrightEmbed
