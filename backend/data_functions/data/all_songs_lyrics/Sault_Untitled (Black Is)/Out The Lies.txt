Out The Lies LyricsThe revolution has come (Out the lies)
Still won't put down the gun (Out the lies)
The revolution has come (Out the lies)
Still won't put down the gun (Out the lies)
The revolution has come (Out the lies)
Still won't put down the gun (Out the lies)
The revolution has come (Out the lies)
Still won't put down the gun (Out the lies)
The revolution has come (Out the lies)
Still won't put down the gun (Out the lies)
The revolution has come (Out the lies)
Still won't put down the gun (Out the lies)
The revolution has come (Out the lies)
Still won't put down the gun
(Put down the gun, put down the gun)
(Put down the gun, put down the gun)
Black is safety
Black is benevolence
Black is a lifeboat after an SOS
Breaker, breaker, all clear
Black told ya it's all gonna be okay in the end
Black is Granny
Black is Aunty
Black is, "There's still meat on that bone, lil' girl"
Am I eating wrong?
Black is so warm and so pure
And when everything else fails
Black enduresEmbed
