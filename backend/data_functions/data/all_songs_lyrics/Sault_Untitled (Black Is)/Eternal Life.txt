Eternal Life LyricsI see sadness in your eye
'Cause I know that you don't wanna die
You should try talk to your friends
This is not how your story ends
You should cry right up the sky
'Cause there's no limits to your life
Know it's hard inside your head
'Cause you can't tell if you're alive or dead
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
Cover me with love, love, love
I just wanna see you smile
(Listen to your inner child)
Never too late for your dreams
Even though life's not what it's promised to be
Every day, we shine (Every day, we shine)
'Cause you're the son of the light (Just live your life, live your life)
Lift your spirit high (Lift your spirits high)
'Cause you're the son of the light (For eternal life)
Every day, we shine (Every day, we shine)
'Cause you're the son of the light (Just live your life, live your life)
Lift your spirit high (Lift your spirits high)
'Cause you're the son of the light
For eternal life
Proud of who you are
Only God is close
Lift your spirit high
'Cause you're the sun of the light
Brother, wipe your tears
'Cause I'll never let you down, I swear
Every day, we shine for eternal lifeEmbed
