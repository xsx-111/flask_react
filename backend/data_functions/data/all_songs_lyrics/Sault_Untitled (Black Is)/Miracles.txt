I know you're looking for a miracle
You say you just kinda find a miracle
You're looking for something good
Oh, you're looking for something real good
Something you could look forward to
But don't you cry now
Keep going
Just trust
And always remember
It's already done
I'm looking for a (Miracle)

Deep in my heart
Mhm

I'm looking for a (Miracle)
So deep in my heart (Miracle)
Oh (Miracle)
Well, if you haven't noticed (Noticed)
Look around, baby, you're the miracle
That's right, you
One hundred percent, bonafide, grade A miracle
Don't you forget that now
You might be down, but you ain't out (You ain't out)
Think about all you are
Think about all the things that had to go right
In order for you to be here
After all these years, I finally shed tears and I've come through
After all these years, I finally shed tears and I've come through
