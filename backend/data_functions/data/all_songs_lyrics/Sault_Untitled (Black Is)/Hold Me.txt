Hold Me Lyrics
You're just broken because of them
No need to worry again
Thought you said you never loved me
Don't lie, sunshine
All these words in your head

Hold me
Hold me

We can push forward, move on
Or we can choose bitterness
And I know you like to help those when it's hard to help yourself
But now it's time you let go
Let go

Hold me
Hold me

Won't stop
Won't stop
You can't stop
Won't stop
You can't stop, never stop
(Forever)Embed
