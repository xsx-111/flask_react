Monsters Lyrics
Monsters again
Everyone's scared to look 'cause they fear
The monster under the bed
Livin' in the closet and under the stairs
There are monsters, are monsters
Monsters, there are monsters

Miss what's under the river Nile?
Mr. Liar got a secret now
Take off your suit, you're just a sorry clown
And why are all my people disappearing now?
Will you tell the world who is Africa?
And everything you say is always aimed at killing her
Pray, pray, pray, indigo child
Just so you know, they call us monsters 'cause they're in denial

Monsters again
Everyone's scared to look 'cause they fear
The monster under the bed
Livin' in the closet and under the stairs
There are monsters, are monsters
Monsters, there are monsters
'Cause I'm a monster
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Look at our hair, look how we wear our crowns
God's speaking to our inner child
Get together, aim focus now
Elevate the intuition now
Baby, your mind is worth more than gold
Wipe your tears so they can see the glow
Pray, pray, pray, indigo child
Pray, pray, pray, indigo child
Look at our hair, look how we wear our crowns
God's speaking to our inner child
Get together, aim focus now
Elevate the intuition now
Baby, your mind is worth more than gold
Wipe your tears so they can see the glow
Pray, pray, pray, indigo child
Just so you know, they call us monsters 'cause they're in denial

Monsters again
Everyone's scared to look 'cause they fear
The monster under the bed
Livin' in the closet and under the stairs
There are monsters, are monsters
Monsters, there are monsters
Monsters again
Everyone's scared to look 'cause they fear
The monster under the bed
Livin' in the closet and under the stairs
There are monsters, are monsters
Monsters, there are monsters
Mr. Liar got a secret now
Mr. Liar got a secret nowEmbed
