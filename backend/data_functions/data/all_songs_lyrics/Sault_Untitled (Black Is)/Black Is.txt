Black Is Lyrics
We all know black is beautiful
You know, well now you do
Black is excellent too
In me, in you
Black is shiny and new
Black is older than earth
All at the same damn time
Black is sweet
Black is ours
Black is love
Black is God
God is us

Don't be afraid
We can make a change and we can make it different
The anger, it breaks my heart to see this and then we know we have to try
Please let the right people do what they have to
You be strong, educate yourself, powerful
Learn when you grow up, be your own master
You can be your own boss
You can have your own company, you can have your own business
You don't need to work for anyone but yourselfEmbed
