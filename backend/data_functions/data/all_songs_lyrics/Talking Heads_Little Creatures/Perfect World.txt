Perfect World Lyrics
Well, I know what it is
But I don't know where it is
Where it is
Well, I know where it is
But I don't know what it looks like
What it looks like
Well, I know what it looks like
But I don't know where she comes from
Well, I know where she comes from
But I don't know what's her name

And she said
This is a perfect world
I'm riding on an incline
I'm staring in your face
You'll photograph mine

And I've been walking, talking
Believing the things that are true
And I've been finding the difference between right and wrong
Bad and good
See me put things together, put them back
Where they belong
When I look at each other
Have I always been singing the same song?
She said
This is a perfect world
I'm riding on an incline
I'm staring in your face
You'll photograph mine

Somebody said that it happens all over the world
I do believe that it's true
And the sun's coming up
And we're doing all the things that we should
Ah, ah, ah
Doesn't everybody here believe in the things that we do?
Ah, ah, ah

And she said
This is a perfect world
I'm riding on an incline
I'm staring in your face
You'll photograph mine
Hey, hey, hey, hey

It's a strange situation
What's wrong with you?
Baby, baby, baby
What you doing in my house?
I, I said it's all true
Hey, hey, hey, hey, there's nothing wrong with you
And I said
This is a perfect world
I'm riding on an incline
I'm staring in your face
You'll photograph mine1Embed
