Remember LyricsI know it will break out
All that you have been given
Feel it flower underneath your skin
Unless you let it shiver
I keep myself within
This long and holy light
Remember
These days
It stays here
Forever
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
These days are marked
It saves our lives
All this blood that surrounds me
Break into my veins
I keep myself within
This long and holy light
Remember
These days
Forever
It stays here

And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself within
And I keep myself within and I keep myself withinEmbed
