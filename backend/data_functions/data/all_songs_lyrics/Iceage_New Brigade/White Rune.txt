White Rune Lyrics
Marching, marching
Across the land, the land
A marching church, our marching church
It reaches you, withdraws you
She, she
Holds her figure, her figure
Oh marching church, oh marching church
Lifeless, like marble

White runes lies in deathbeds
And deathbed lies in white runes
I am white rune
I am white rune
White runes lies in deathbeds
And deathbed lies in white runes
I am white rune
I am white rune

Forced to completeness
Forever, forever
Oh marching church, oh marching church
Lifeless, it reaches you
White runes lies in deathbeds
And deathbed lies in white runes
I am white rune
I am white rune
White runes lies in deathbeds
And deathbed lies in white runes
I am white rune
I am white rune

White rune

White runes lies in deathbeds
And deathbed lies in white runes
I am white rune
I am white runeEmbed
