Rotting Heights LyricsIn this act
My blood is blessed
My purple skin
Peeled in light
Endlessly
Surrounding limps
I fall these
Rotting heights
I fall these
Rotting heights
Beyond her land
We stay
Flesh red glares
Desolves me
Drowns us
Bone on bone
I fall these
Rotting heights
I fall these
Rotting heightsEmbed
