Broken Bone Lyrics
Broken ankle
See the end following you
I want to touch your ah hands
Just keep on searching
Just keep on searching
 (x3)
I thought I had it
But that time it was
Just a broken bone
Just a broken bone

And It takes you down
And It takes you down
And It takes you down
And It takes you down
Down down down down
Down down down down
