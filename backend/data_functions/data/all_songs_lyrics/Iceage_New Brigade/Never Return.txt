Never Return Lyrics
Colors drift by fast in front of me
Concrete ground is harsh and it burns
If I touch with fingers then I'll see
This beauty is forever
Never return

I'll never return (x2)
When wounds crack open, all truth kick in clear
And it leaves me with a burn

These colors they will fade before my eyes
Hopeless but complete
Nothing is lies
If I touch with my fingers
Then I'll see
No sickness is forever
Never return


I'll never return (x2)
When wounds crack open, all truth kick in clear
And it leaves me with a burnEmbed
