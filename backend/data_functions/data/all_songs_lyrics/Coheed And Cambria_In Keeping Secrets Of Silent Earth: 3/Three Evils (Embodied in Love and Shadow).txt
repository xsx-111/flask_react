Three Evils (Embodied in Love and Shadow) Lyrics
Across the floor, in the hand of where we drove the drill
A cautious ear to the mouth of your confession
Think of all the things we put him through
In the face of his god, would he tell the truth?
Still, recorded were the words that dribbled out his kiss
When eyes go blind in this man of what could once become
Sever the limbs off his torso, in sleep
And burn what remains, so the world may now see
No longer will we wait for your answers
Back to the hell where you've come from
Think of all the times you've once had
Write them in a letter that says "goodbye"

You'll listen to reason
While you're face down in the dirt
You'll stomach the hurt and break for him, here
Just how much he's worth

Slowly discarded were the remains of his lonely youth
Among the alley, where the dwellers scare to notice
Picture a young boy in pieces and streets with leveled
Malfunctions, no name to be called redeemer
We'll fix him, restore him
With the love is no other
Think of all the things you did before
Write them in a letter that says "reborn"

You'll listen to reason
While you're face down in the dirt
You'll stomach the hurt and break for him, here
Just how much he's worth

(Following you across the interstate, walking away!)
Walking away, I'll fire on!
(Following you across the interstate, walking away!)
Walking away, I'll fire on!
(Following you across the interstate, walking away!)
Walking away, I'll fire on!

On the wrong way out
On the causeway to neverwhere
On the wrong way out
On the causeway to neverwhere
On the wrong way out
On the causeway to neverwhere
Dear, my friends
In the time we've spent
Forever after, beyond this
When will our nightmare ever end, end, end?
Dear, my friends
In the time we've spent
Forever after, beyond this
When will our nightmare ever end, end, end?
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Forever you will, forever you will learn
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Forever you will, forever you will learn
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Forever you will, forever you will learn
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Pull the trigger and the nightmare stops
Forever you will, forever you will learnEmbed
