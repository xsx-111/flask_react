A Favor House Atlantic Lyrics
Your eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could
Recall the moments that once have
Retract the footsteps that brought us to this favor
I wouldn't ask this of you

Good eye, sniper
Here, I'll shoot, you run

The words you scribbled on the walls
With the loss of friends you didn't have
I'll call you when the time is right
Are you in or are you out
For them all to know the end of us all?

Run quick, they're behind us, didn't think we'd ever make it
This close to safety, in one piece
Now you wanna kill me in the act of what could maybe
Save us from sleep and what we are

Good eye, sniper
Now I shoot, you run
The words you scribbled on the walls
With the loss of friends you didn't have
I'll call you when the time is right
Are you in or are you out
For them all to know the end of us all?

Bye bye, beautiful
Don't bother to write
Disturbed by your words
And they're calling all cars
Face step, let down
Face step, step down

The words you scribbled on the walls
The loss of friends you didn't have
I'll call you when the time is right
Are you in or are you out
For them all to know...

Bye bye, beautiful
Don't bother to write
Disturbed by your words
And they're calling all cars
Face step, let down
Face step, step down
Bye bye, beautiful
Don't bother to write
Disturbed by your words
And they're calling all cars
Face step, let down
Face step, step down6Embed
