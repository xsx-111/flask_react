Blood Red Summer Lyrics
Faint white figures paint my sleep
Please don't tell my secrets, keep them hidden
(You got it, you got it, you got it)
If the words that matter reach your face, from floor
Will you be wondering if, or
(Do I need what is given or honest?)
Does it cost me scarring if the words stay true
Even number your nephew?
(I don't want it, don't want it, don't want it anymore)

And when the answer that you want
Is in the question that you state
Come what may, come what may
And when the answer that you want
Is in the question that you state
Come what may, come what may

In a pain that buckles out your knees
Could you stop this if I plead?
(You got it, you got it, you got it)
So destined I am, to walk among the dark
A child in keeping secrets from
(Will they know what I've done in the after?)
In the sought for matter when the words blame you
In a blood red summer, I'll give you
(I don't want it, don't want it, don't want it)

And when the answer that you want
Is in the question that you state
Come what may, come what may
And when the answer that you want
Is in the question that you state
Come what may, come what may

What did I do to deserve...
What did I do to deserve...
(This? This?)
What did I do to deserve...
What did I do to deserve...
(This? This?)

What did I do to deserve...
What did I do to deserve...
(This? This?)
What did I do to deserve...
What did I do to deserve...
(This? This?)
What did I do to deserve...
What did I do to deserve...
(This? This?)
What did I do to deserve...
What did I do?2Embed
