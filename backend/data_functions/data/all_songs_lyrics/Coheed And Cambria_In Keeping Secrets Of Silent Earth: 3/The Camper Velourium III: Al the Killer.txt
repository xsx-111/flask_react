The Camper Velourium III: Al the Killer Lyrics
At birth given scars along tender heart liberties
Injustice for awkward living situated casualties
They lay dead along your floor
Careful not to wake them, they're sleeping
In the morrow's good mourning
The dying will discard the wish to live

(Let this colony know)
(In the name of the dead, we're coming!)

When I kill her, I'll have her
(Dance upon the graves of the dead, upon your name!)
And die white girls, die white girls
(Dance upon the graves of the dead)
(Upon the graves of the dead!)

You'll get nothing for something
Arise the hidden war of a dead, song unsung
The night of your children's day
Beneath the surface, sealed by the floors, boarded up
Seal the lips of your voice with haste
And cowering at the sounds as they make their way
Surprise speed and malice
The opposing break the surface hold ready
(Let this colony know)
(In the name of the dead, we're coming!)

When I kill her, I'll have her
(Dance upon the graves of the dead, upon your name!)
And die white girls, die white girls
(Dance upon the graves of the dead)
(Upon the graves of the dead!)

Will the killing veil love
Should the heroes play dumb, dumb?
But killing's no fun
When the heroes are numb, numb

(Let this colony know)
(In the name of the dead, we're coming!)

Bye bye world, bye bye world
(Dance upon the graves of the dead, upon your name!)
Die white girls, die white girls
(Dance upon the graves of the dead)
(Upon the graves of the dead!)
Bye bye world, bye bye world
(Dance upon the graves of the dead, upon your name!)
Die white girls, bye bye world
(Dance upon the graves of the dead)
(Upon the graves of the dead)
(Upon the graves of the dead, upon the graves!)Embed
