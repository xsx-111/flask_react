21:13 Lyrics
In our sleep, there's more to this nightmare
Will she beg for your mercy?
Slowly but sure, I'm hoping what comes
In the absence of love
At night, she'll kick and she'll fight
Should they fail in his sight
At night, I'll worry from all
The end of us all

Please, Mom, they're coming for me!
Please, Mom, run, lock your door, they're coming for me!

When the clock reads 21:13
All work will stop and the ground will relieve

Please, Mom, they're coming for me!
Please, Mom, run, lock your door, they're coming for...

When I fall asleep, your face is all I see
Dear Momma, I love
I fall asleep, your face is all I dream
Dear Momma, I love
In your frame, you'll bid this well
In the face you miss the most
You'll see them soon
Stop! I bid you fair warning, stay up until you...
When the memories occur
Of a life you haven't lived
Stay still, you will
And I've got a secret to hide
And I've got a secret to hide

In the words of father to son
Thy kingdom come

Please, mom, they're coming for me!
Please, mom, run, lock your door, they're coming for...

When I fall asleep, your face is all I see
Dear Momma, I love
I fall asleep, your face is all I dream
Dear Momma, I love
In those days we lost our dignity
The eager dare to stand
The ride home through victory
On the innocent, they tread
But IRO-bot will never die
IRO-bot will never die
But IRO-bot will never die
But IRO-bot will never dieEmbed
