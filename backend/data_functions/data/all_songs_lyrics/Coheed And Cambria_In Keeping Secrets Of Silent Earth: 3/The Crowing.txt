The Crowing Lyrics

I fed the clues of a lost day killed in motion
But I thought of it so
Like there's no other way it could have been done
Will they size my fit
For a puzzle I wish not to play part in it?
A heart stained in hate
A feeling I fear will play circles

But you, you were my favorite
But you, you know, you were my favorite

I've severed my ties
To shroud this body under the streets of this city
And wait for the day
When I am summoned to walk across the face
Well, slowly but clearer, now
In visions that play and plague memories
I love them with all (Heart)
As a son should to mother and father
But you, you were my favorite
But you, you know, you were my favorite

Would I walk through the door
Shedding the light of all life?
With the rise and reform
Would I come as before?

Pray you're not the only one
Pray you're not the only...


If given mistakes would I take them back?
If erasing them could, if erasing them would

But would they be the words that I would say?
Your face and a door between
I've parted three ways
For you, the Newo that I loved
Did you ever really know before
My face, shamed to break?
Did you ever really know before
My mind, scared to think?
Did you ever really know before
My name, son to these?
Did you, did you, did you come clean
In the end, from the start?

Dear Ambelina
The Prise wishes you to watch over me
Dear Ambelina
The Prise wishes all to watch over me

I fought the decisions that called and lost
My mark has a relevant piece in this
I will come reformed
In short, for the murders of those I court
I bless the hour that holds your fall
I will kill you all
I will call you out from shelter (I will cross you out)
Burn your wings, you'll know no better (Burn your wings)
I will call you out from shelter (I will cross you out)
Burn your wings and learn their letters (Burn your wings)
Dear Ambelina
The Prise wishes you to watch over me
Dear Ambelina
To watch over meEmbed
