The Light & the Glass Lyrics
Slowly, the pen touches paper
In the guidance of the words that you write
Memories roll in of the things you once did
And who you had shared them with
Is somebody thinking of you
Did I bother telling you this
With the words that cross teeth and jump lips?
A poor choice of words in wanting to tell you anything
But words don't come with ease
They're forever my hurt
Would it really matter
If you were to count the days left with your hands?
Your focus secure on the loves you left well
Smiles staged in photographs
Here until...
You, you left the light on
There's a chance I might have tripped, girl
But you were there to hold on

Ignoring the words of your obnoxious little brother
"Kill or be killed", spilled the words from your mother
I'll lay awake for a while
I'll leave the light on a while
But you couldn't last a lifetime
Caught between here and the days of it
Carving her name across your arm
With every wish, it's hit or miss her
I told you so
I measure distance in lines
Departing the rest of my life

But you, you, you
You had better things to do
But you, you, you
You had better things to do

Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, lie away
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, lie away

Ignoring the words of your obnoxious little brother
"Kill or be killed," spilled the words from your mother
I'll lay awake for a while
I'll leave the light on a while
But you couldn't last a lifetime
Caught between here and the days of it
Carving her name across your arm
With every wish, it's hit or miss her
I told you so
I measure distance in lines
Departing the rest of my life

If you'd get put to sleep
Like an old dog, you're better off
If you'd get put to sleep
I've been cautious with the words I extend
Allow this year before the world starts to end

"Your father's dead, he passed in his sleep"
And I woke to the sounds of her crying
"Your father's dead, he passed in his sleep"
And I woke to the sounds of her crying
"Your father's dead, he passed in his sleep"
And I woke to the sounds of her crying
"Your father's dead, he passed in his sleep"
Pray for us all, pray for us all
Pray for us all, pray for us all
