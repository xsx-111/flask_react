Cuts Marked in the March of Men Lyrics
Listen to the world out on the outside, pressing in
Are you ready on my mark?
Fingers given names and with the last word, they ascend
On the comfort of their well being in arms
Into something they can't stop
But wish that they could kill
You're the answer to their prayers

In your last hour stand
You'll notice the one that you have loved in dreams
Is here, among the others
Chase, it's you I want!

But if I can't have her
Then why should I spend any more time
In a world that's gonna end pretty soon?
I need you now, more than I ever did
I'll hand myself over for you
This comm-link's lost its frequency
And I feel that we're coming home short
Here, take me instead
I'd rather not see her off, alone
Scattered amongst the killing streets, the children slate defense
Is God's work to have us fail?
Rivered blood shoots out the dead, as bodies foul the air
I'll make peace when this is done
In arms, we storm
Slowly, the streets begin to fill
With new flesh bound to bone
Armed and ready, it begins again

In your last hour stand
You'll notice the one that you have loved in dreams
Is here, among the others
Chase, it's you I want!

But if I can't have her
Then why should I spend any more time
In a world that's gonna end pretty soon?
I need you now, more than I ever did
I'll hand myself over for you
This comm-link's lost its frequency
And I feel that we're coming home short
Here, take me instead
I'd rather not see her off, alone
Tonight, we storm
Tonight...

Deliver a favor to my love
Deliver a favor to my love
Deliver a favor to my love
Deliver a favor to my love

In your last hour stand, you'll notice
The one that you have loved in dreams
Is here, among the others
Chase, it's you I want!

But if I can't have her
Then why should I spend any more time
In a world that's gonna end pretty soon?
I need you now, more than I ever did
I'll hand myself over for you
This comm-link's lost its frequency
And I feel that we're coming home short
Here, take me instead
I'd rather not see her off, aloneEmbed
