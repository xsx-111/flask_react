The Camper Velourium II: Backend of Forever Lyrics
Rocked silent in a soft lullaby
Panic stirred me, awakened by a ringing phone in time
Where and when would I see her?
Crazy were the words that scribbled out your mouth
I stuttered, replacing your face to those words
Where and when would I kill her?
I'll wish on this, I'll wish with this
I, I'll wish to the bitter end of my day
Well...where were you?

So you had your turn, and you made it work
Now I'm the laughing stock of your joke
As crazy as it may seem, I cried for you when you
Told me to date all of the things
That made you end up in my life
And I'll believe anything, I have no luck with girls

I overheard that you were unhappy too
Misleading trust into a relationship that makes no sense
Over and out, Connecticut
But you had your back turned, there, as you faded away
At the end of my day I found out
You weren't worth what I thought of you
What I thought of you

Write this down in your diary you abuse
Can we make plans? Can I just get through to you?
Is this weird?
Do I scare her!?
I'll wish on this, I'll wish with this
I, I'll wish
That you could share the love you shared with others
With me...

So, you had your turn, and you made it work
Now I'm the laughing stock of your joke
As crazy as it may seem, I cried for you when you
Told me to date all of the things
That made you end up in my life
And I'll believe anything, I have no luck with girls

I overheard that you were unhappy too
Misleading trust into a relationship that makes no sense
Over and out, Connecticut
But you had your back turned, there, as you faded away
At the end of my day I found out
You weren't worth what I thought of you
What I thought of you

{indecipherable vocalizations}
(What I thought of you)
{indecipherable vocalizations}
But this isn't love
So, forever let it go
Forever let it burn
But this isn't love
There on the backend of forever
I wish I would never
Hurt again...
(I wish I would never hurt again)
No...
(I wish I would never hurt again)
And I wish I would never hurt again
(I wish I would never hurt again)
(I wish I would never hurt again)Embed
