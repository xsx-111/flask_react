The Camper Velourium I: Faint of Hearts Lyrics
(Koo koo ka-choo!)

With the worries that I'd give her in
They told the worst of me
My wanting just to hold your neck in my arms
And feel me squeeze
No, I'm not gonna give you what you want
So if you please
The sin that shapes your voice carries my ears
This new disease

Did somebody take your tongue?
In worries of the words that you couldn't say
If they could've saved them from
But I don't wanna sleep without...
So I bid to you, goodnight
Tonight, sleep tight, my love

The anxious through the calming storm
You'll sit as you pray for rain
I'll touch it if you ask me to
But how is up to you
No, I'm not gonna let you get up
If you struggle willingly
I'll favor all your form to show you
How it's been done to me

Did somebody take your tongue?
In worries of the words that you couldn't say
If they could've saved them from
But I don't wanna sleep without...
So I bid to you, goodnight
Tonight, sleep tight, my love

With all the words you say
You'll say

You were so well behaved
As you watched and made your way
This gift for you engraved
The shift as you stretch your legs
You were so well behaved
You were so well
Who taught these tricks that make
You were so well behaved
If the world stops turning, girl
You better not stop when I say
If there was nothing you could do to stop it
Why'd you try?
Then the ground stops parting
Through the silence, as you woke up the dead
Everything here dies, alone

But I'm not quite sure
What you've been told, on Labor Day
Oh, I'm not starting with you
But the faint of hearts, while worries wait
But I'm not quite sure
What this unfolds, on Labor Day
Oh, I'm not starting with you
But the faint of hearts

Did somebody take your tongue?
In worries of the words that you couldn't say
If they could've saved them from
(With all the words you say)
But I don't wanna sleep without...
So I bid to you, goodnight
Tonight, sleep tight, my love
With all the words you say
Did somebody take your tongue? (No, no)
In worries of the words that you couldn't say
If they couldn't save them from
(With all the words you say)
But I don't wanna sleep without it
So I bid to you, goodnight
Tonight, sleep tight, my gunEmbed
