In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 Lyrics
A broad incision sits across the evening
The victim to our fathers' lost war
The restless children sit and mourn the graves
Of those they've never seen before
Will they be buried here, among the dead
In the silent secret?

The pioneers
In dealing with if they march for dawn
Of Will and worthy
The truth be told, the child was born

Man your own jackhammer!
Man your battle stations
We'll have you dead, pretty soon
And now
Sincerely written
From my brother's blood machine to yours
Man your battle stations
We'll have you home, pretty soon
And now
Awake through motion
With curiosity to curtain your first move
Over arms length, they'll break protocol
Jealous envy for the youngest one
To be the hero is all I'll ask
Can I be buried here, among the dead
With room to honor me here in the end?
You'll be better off too soon
You'll be better off when you get home

The pioneers
In dealing with if they march for dawn
Of Will and worthy
The truth be told, the child was born

Man your own jackhammer!
Man your battle stations
We'll have you dead, pretty soon
And now
Sincerely written
From my brother's blood machine to yours
Man your battle stations
We'll have you home, pretty soon
And now
For you, I'd do anything just to make you happy
Hear you tell me that you're proud of me
For them, I'll kill anything
Cut the throats of babies for them
Break their hearts, for they were there
Waiting for you to say "I love you, too"
The navigator, the pilot, her favorite
The one they call the Vision that bears the gift
The navigator, the pilot, her favorite
The one they call the Vision that bears the gift

Will, do the children really understand
The things you did to them?
And why, oh why, should they conjure up the will?
For you, my love, I would kill him
We're coming home pretty soon
Coming home
In the seventh turning hour, will the victims' shadow fall?
Should the irony grow hungry
With the victory and all they sought for
We were one among the fence
One among the fence...
Now, we're coming home
Man your own jackhammer!
Man your battle stations
We'll have you dead, pretty soon
And now
Sincerely written
From my brother's blood machine to yours
Man your battle stations
We'll have you home, pretty soon
Tonight...5Embed
