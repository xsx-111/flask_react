Extracurricular Lyrics
Nuisance
An actor choking on nectar
Nothing gotten
Narcoleptics will cut off these patients blue arms
Peg-legged
Sullen
Drool on these words I've never uttered
Yes I swear

Outstayed our welcome
A jab from behind
Spoke on these crutches
You wouldn't mind
I had the rack ignored in your last implants

Maiden winters
Tickling whispers
Sit still or you can't just listen
Extra extra extracurricular
Determine if the wick can burn

Acid
Cracked ribs
Timber
Class dismissed
Sutured
Swollen
Spiteful of these silent urns
Yes I swear

Legs cracked and head dressed
A jab from behind
A trolley over the sun
You wouldn't mind
Bull legged attrition on this satellite

Maiden winters
Tickling whispers
Sit still or you can't just listen
Extra extra extracurricular
Determine if the wick can burn


The weak are supposed to die
The weak are supposed to die
The weak are supposed to die
The weak are supposed to die
And you can't see this lighthouse
Cause there's no place to go
This siphon drinks the water
But it will never grow
