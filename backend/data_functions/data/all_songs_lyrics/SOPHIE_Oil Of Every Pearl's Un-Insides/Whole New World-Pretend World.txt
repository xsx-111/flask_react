Whole New World/Pretend World LyricsPart I: Whole New World

Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
For you and me

Visions
Visions in my head
Visions of you and me, we're in love
Ecstasy
Feelings
Feelings in my skin
Feelings I want to know, want to hold
Broken free

Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Promises
Promises might come true
Promises of a life uncontained
Seafoam blue

I looked into your eyes
I thought that I could see a whole new world

Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Progress
Pushing through the mould
Tracing with my fingers, waking up
Wanting growth

I looked into your eyes
I thought that I could see a whole new world

Whole new world (A whole new)
Whole new world (A whole new)
Whole new world (A whole new)
Whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new... world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole new world
Whole new world
Whole new world
There's a whole-
For you and me
Whole new world!
Whole new world!
Whole new world!
Whole new world!
Whole new world!
Whole new world!
Part II: Pretend World


I feel so cold
Is this the way I feel?
All along
You were just faking
Or was it all me
I could suffer
Tried to resist myself
I pretended for you
Was acting out this pretend fulfilling
It was just pretend, pretend, pretend
But itâ€™s so real for me
You were just pretending
You don't make me feel loved
You were making feelings
You made me up
Were we just pretending?19Embed
