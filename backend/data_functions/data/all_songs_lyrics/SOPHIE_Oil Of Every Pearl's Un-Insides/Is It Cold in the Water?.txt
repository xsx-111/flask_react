Is It Cold in the Water? Lyrics
I'm freezing
I'm burning
I've left my home
Soft ache, me
Earth shaking
I feel alone

Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?

I'm falling
Depths endless
Worlds turn to smoke
One hundred years flicker
I kiss the snow

Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
Is it cold in the water?
I'm swimming, I'm breathing, evaporating
Is it cold in the water?
I'm liquid, I'm floating into the blue15Embed
