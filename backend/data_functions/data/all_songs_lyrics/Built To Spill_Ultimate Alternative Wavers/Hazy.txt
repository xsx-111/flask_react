Hazy Lyrics
Hazy
Just because sometimes you make me crazy
Just because sometimes you let me know
I don't
Maybe
Today will show me the something that will phase me
Something that will move me besides dreams
It seems
Seems like
Lately
Everything I see and hear makes me angry
Even what I say and do myself
What else can I say
I'm still waiting for this moment to be gone
Million mile second
A million thoughts in one
High and wondering why so loud and bright
I ain't got no idea what the hell is going onEmbed
