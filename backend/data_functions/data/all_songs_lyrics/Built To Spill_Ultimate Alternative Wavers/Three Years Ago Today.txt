Three Years Ago Today Lyrics
The other night I dreamed about a sudden realization
That everything bad that can happen to me would
Woke up screaming "God, I hope I'm not bleeding
Out my eyes or mouth when I die"

I have seen a sheepish wonder
I see me three years ago today
No one's gonna push my buttons
No one's gonna have their say

A little while later I was trying to remember
But then it didn't seem quite as awful as it seemed
Can't believe I won't admit that

I have seen a sheepish wonder
I see me three years ago today
No one's gonna push my buttons
No one's gonna have their way

Feel about the same but I'm 10 years older
Watched my cat die for a month now
I have seen a sheepish wonder
I saw you earlier todayEmbed
