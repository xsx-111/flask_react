Lie For A Lie Lyrics
I can see a storm awaiting
Quietly anticipating
Don't deny, it no debating

A lie for a lie
A truth for a truth

Cruel, but everybody does it
I thought by now I'd rise above it
You complain but don't discuss it

A lie for a lie
A truth for a truth

I know the thoughts are on your brain
And even if they're not the same
Close enough so don't explain

A lie for a lie
A truth for a truth
Once in a while there's this girl I don't know in my dreams
She reminds me of a lot of people
She's someone that I've never seen
And she's perfect

'Kay begin
...some inaudible screamingEmbed
