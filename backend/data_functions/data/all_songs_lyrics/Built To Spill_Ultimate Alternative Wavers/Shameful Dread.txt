Shameful Dread Lyrics
Before I get myself unwound
Come around
Docility is tempting bait
Clear-cut faith
You settle with a different god
Tiny thoughts
No other way to come to terms
No need to learn

I'm hoping for a change of heart
Hundredth start
A president to call my own
Barely shown
I'll never let you in my head
Shameful dread
I'm hoping for a change of hope
Until I spent some time with you
Thought that everything I do has no weight

Doesn't float, has no weight
Doesn't float

Going to see this through
Lucky youEmbed
