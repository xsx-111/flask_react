Built To Spill LyricsBuilt to spill
You are pleased precariously
Temporarily filled
You will
Spill until lower expectations
Momentarily chilled
You will
Built to spill
Because at the time it seemed
Like an acceptable deal
You feel
You feel like you are on the verge of something real
On a role and built to spill
This is how you'll always feel
It's no big deal
I'm ashamed of you my friend
Would you please
Would you please
I'm to blame for this my friend
Would you please
Would you please
Built to spill
Carry out your function
Then occasionally filled
You will
You will come alive to something real
Then realize you're built to spill
This is how you'll always feel
It's no big dealEmbed
