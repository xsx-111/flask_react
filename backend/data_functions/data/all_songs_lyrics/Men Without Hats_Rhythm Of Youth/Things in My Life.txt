Things in My Life LyricsThere are things I will never remember
And there are things I will never forget
There are things I will cherish forever
And there are things I will always regret
Well I think that I'm in Scotland
And I'm walking through a forest in the rain
And I wonder if I'll fall in love again
We can never remember the things we always forget
There are things you can buy in a drugstore
There are things you can hang on your wall
There are things you can read in the paper
There are things that do nothing at all
Well I think that I'm in Scotland
And I'm walking through a forest in the rain
And I wonder if I'll fall in love again
We can never remember the things we always forget
Things like polyester pants and shoes don't make it easy to remember
Was it here or yesterday, or wasn't it the 14th of November
Well I think that I'm in Scotland
And I'm walking through a forest in the rain
And I wonder if I'll fall in love again
We can never remember the things we always forget
Well, I think that I'm invincible but when I think about it once again
I ask myself "Is this the way things end?"
We can always remember the things we never forgetEmbed
