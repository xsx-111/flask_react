Ideas for Walls LyricsSo many things in my head, I've always had them before
No reason to be upset, they're just ideas for walls
Now I'm standing inside, outside, which is the right side
I'm standing, demanding that the nightlife be called the right life
Like putting paint on my feet & walking sideways in rows
My walls could be so complete, complete with patterns of toes
Now I'm standing inside, outside, which is the right side
I'm standing the left side, right side, which is the right side
Now-ideas
Ideas for walls
Ideas for walls
Ideas for walls
A little m for the mirror, a W for the wall
To make things perfectly clear, a great big H in the hall
Now I'm standing inside, outside, which is the right side
I'm standing, demanding that the nightlife be called the right life
Is everybody confused? (no) I'm making no sense at all
You want a room with a view you need ideas for walls
Now I'm standing inside, outside, which is the right side
I'm standing inside, outside, outside, right side
Inside, outside, which is the right side
Now -- ideas
