Living in China LyricsGot the Red Book
They got the new look
The little people that are living in China
Got the answers to all the questions
The little people that are living in China
The solution is revolution
For the little people that are living in China
Got ping pong, egg foo yung
All the little people that are living in China
What
Would Chairman Mao say
If he knew
What they're doing to his wife today?
What
Did China do?
She ordered out
For submarines instead of Chinese food
China!
Fields of rice!
Modern man
No longer evil, he a paradise!
What
Did the Chairman want?
A great big wall
They could all watch Occidentals on
Chorus
What
Would Chairman Mao say
If he knew
What his people think of him today?
Revolution is out of hand
The "Gang Of Four"
Trying to make it as a Western band
China
What do you need
You've got everything
From your scruffy head to dirty feet
China
Do you want to dance
You're wearing makeup
And listening to Adam And The Ants
They've got the new look
They've got the Red Book
The little people that are living in China
They're wearing loafers
Collecting posters
The little people that are living in China
The solution is revolution
For the little people that are living in China
They've got the answers to all your questions
The little people that are living in
China
Living in China
China
Living in China
China
