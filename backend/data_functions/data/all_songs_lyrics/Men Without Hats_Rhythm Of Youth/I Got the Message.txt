I Got the Message LyricsI got the message and the message is clear
I really really really really wish you were here
It was written of the back of a carton d'allumettes
It said, "I don't really miss you, but I haven't tried yet"
I got the message and the message is proof
There really is a thing they call the rhythm of youth
It will pick you up and it will make you wiggle this way
Et c'est facile à dire and it's easy to say
It's mine, not yours
Get down, on all fours
It's long and hard, this road to Mars
I have done a good thing
I got you going
Everybody's moving, watch out, it's showing
I have done a good thing
I got you dancing and everbody's happy
I have done a good thing
I got you moving
Everybody's dancing
They're really grooving
I have done a good thing (dansez moderne)
And everybody's happy
I got the message and the message is clear
I really really really really wish you were here
It was written of the back of a carton d'allumettes
It said, "I don't really miss you, but I haven't tried yet"
I got the message and the message is proof
There really is a thing they call the rhythm of youth
It will pick you up and it will make you wiggle this way
Et c'est facile a dire and it's easy to say
C'est moi, c'est toi
C'est nous, c'est cool
C'est long, c'est dur
Frappons nos têtes contre les murs
I have done a good thing
I got you going
Everybody's moving, it's really showing
I have done a good thing
I got you dancing, everbody's happy
I have done a good thing
I got you moving
Everybody's dancing
It's really groovy
I have done a good thing (dansez moderne)
And everybody's happy
I got the message and the message is clear
I really really really really wish you were here
It was written of the back of a carton d'allumettes
It said, "I don't really miss you, but I haven't tried yet"
I got the message and the message is proof
There really is a thing they call the rhythm of youth
It will pick you up and it will make you wiggle this way
Et c'est facile à dire and it's easy to say
It's mine, not yours
Get down, on all fours
It's long and hard, this road to Mars1Embed
