Antarctica LyricsAntarctica - Antarctica
Antarctica - Antarctica
Ice age is here, right in your town
Antarctica, look what you've done
And I, I feel like I've cheated your scheme
And I, I feel like you really know what I mean
Nightfall's heartbeat, the street's in a mess
On reflector, the beach is endless
And I, I feel like I've cheated your scheme
And I, I feel like you really know what I mean
It's my turn - It's my turn
Antarctica - Antarctica
No day, no night, and always the sound
Ice pressure
It's me that's found
And I, I feel like I'm really part of your scene
And I, I feel like you know what I mean
Pictures moving, and always the whirls
Antarctica, where are you now
And I, I feel like I'm really part of your scheme
And I, I feel like you're loosing your dream
Antarctica - Antarctica
Antarctica - Antarctica
And I, I feel like you know what I mean
And I, I feel like I'm really lost in your seam
It's my turn - It's my turn
It's my turn - It's my turn
It's my turn - It's my turnEmbed
