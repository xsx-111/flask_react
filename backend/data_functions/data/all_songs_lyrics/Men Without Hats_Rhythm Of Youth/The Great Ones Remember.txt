The Great Ones Remember LyricsImagine yourself on the verge of committing
An act that you've always found silly or strange
Imagine yourself on the edge of discovering
Lately things have not been going your way
Communication is hard to establish
When things like a state of mind get in the way
People don't eat they just think what you feed them now
The horses with their blinders eating the hay
Silently watching yourself in the mirror
Wondering if somebody else is to blame
Could it be somebody's in on your destiny
Lately things have trouble looking the same
Could it be somebody else has the answer
Could it be somebody's pulling my strings
Say, that is quite a nice dress that you're wearing now
Jump into another ring
Can you imagine what we put up with now
Generals and morons say we are still as proud
We coin the phrases like we must win or die
It's all so confusing to me, hello goodbye
Don't forget that the great ones remember and
Please, don't forget that we're nearing December and
Isn't it funny, the way it's connected
The print on your shirt and the one on the wall
Imagine if everyone had the same haircut
Wouldn't it be funny running it all?
Communication is hard to maintain
When the clothes that you're wearing are hurting my eyes
Things like improvement don't come overnight, boy
But, at least you could try
Can you imagine what we put up with now
Generals and morons say we are still as proud
We coin the phrases like we must win or die
It's all too confusing for me, hello goodbye
Don't forget that the great ones remember and
Please, don't forget that we're nearing December and
Please, don't forget that the great ones remember and
Please, don't forget where you were toward December
Please, don't forget that the great ones remember and
Please, don't forget that we're nearing December and
Please, don't forget where you were toward DecemberEmbed
