My Heart Is Not at Peace LyricsIf my heart were at peace
Would it be a blossom?
Or, satisfied, would it be a stone?
My heart is not at peace
I woke up hungry
There is wind but there's no song
A satisfied heart
Half sleeping through the days
In the wind, in the home
If my heart were at peace
I would have closed the doors and windows
Satisfaction feels like a tomb
I was writhing in the tomb
My heart a frozen boulder
The "romance" and all I'd rejected
Comes like music on the wind
The violence in my heart
The stone in the mountain
All destroyed by the sweeping broom
All revealed by the burning windEmbed
