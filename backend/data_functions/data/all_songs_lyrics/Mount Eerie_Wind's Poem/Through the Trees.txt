Through the Trees LyricsFrom upon the hill I can see
The lights of town
Through the trees
And there is wind
There is only wind
Do I disdain them?
That "Land of Dreams"?
From up here you can see them living
On the way home, through the trees
I have climbed the hill at twilight
To find the source of the wind
From upon the hill I can see
The lights of town
That "Land of Dreams"
Through the trees
There is only wind
That ‘Land of Dreams’ blows in the wind
That ‘Land of Dreams’ blows in the wind
That ‘Land of Dreams’ blows in the wind
That ‘Land of Dreams’ blows in the wind
From upon the hill...Embed
