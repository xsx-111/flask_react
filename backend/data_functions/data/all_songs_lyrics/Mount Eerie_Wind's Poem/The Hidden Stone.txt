The Hidden Stone LyricsThe stone inside the mountain revealed
A human heart shown
The core unfolding
Song on wind
Tumultuous in the soft world
Bones protruding
The heart blossoms for a moment
Amid stone
And then crawls back inside the cave
Mountain heaving
I can't hear or see from where I'm standing
And I go through my days like this
With a force that tears and erodes at all shapes
In dissatisfaction
Where was the source of wind I thought I found?
On the ridge
Or am I holding this sighing that tears at the house
In my cavern?
The stone on top of my heart is shaking
The wind at the door
Is blowing loudEmbed
