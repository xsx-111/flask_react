Between Two Mysteries LyricsI've seen summons buried in more air
Buried in space
And I just lied down in the snow
Buried in space
I've seen moss covered stumps in dying light
Taking on shapes
Black wooden mythologies
I know a place
Layer after layer of comprehension
Welling up in the morning light between two mysteries
The town rests in the valley beneath Twin Peaks
Buried in space
What goes up there in the night
In that dark, blurry place?
Driving to work in the morning
We live in graves
Always trying to climb out of the hole
Buried in space
And the songs fade, and the singer's die
But my heart will not stop thumping
The shapes in the dark still look convincing
So here I am1Embed
