More Than the Fairy Lyrics
More than the fairy
More than the fairy

More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face

I got my hands on this bitch
Impressed with me, all of these insects spree
They act as if I never meant to be
I never meant to be soft
Until you fixed in a bedroom window
At another place
I know it sounds crazy at the river bank
Ain't thought 'bout shit for a minute, mane
Mane

Twice the thickness Nyquil
Limited discount time kill
I'm here for 24 hours
Letdowns lined up like powder
Amnesia put the address
Expression of a crash test
You tell me I can't call it
All I do is talk shit

More than the fairy

More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
More than the fairy
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face, go
More than the fairy
Make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Forged by my signature, blah blah blah
(Too) Framed up from this track of smote pride
Try to see it from us
Tried is what this only feels though

Mane

Undoing my person in this city strapped with strange lies
Reluctantly searching for what eluded me last night
Been irking for decades
But I didn't trap that trick again
Put this life behind me
But I know that's just a half step

Make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face
Go make that face12Embed
