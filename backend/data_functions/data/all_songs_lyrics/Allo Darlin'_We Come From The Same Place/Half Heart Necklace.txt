Half Heart Necklace LyricsThis lights of this town spell H-E-L-L
Nothing ever happens here I can tell
Your mother said you were born with haunted eyes
I look at you with the eyes of a child
There’s nothing to do
But my love is true
This half-heart necklace is for you
We can go out walking when it gets dark
You can take me in your father’s car
I hope losers can come out on top
Because I don’t ever want this love to stop
There’s nothing to do
But my love is true
This half-heart necklace is for you
Now they question my intelligence
They tell me you’re a bad influence but I know that you’re...
Misunderstood you’re not a criminal
But what I’ve done is unforgivable
And I know nothing ever stays the same
So I’m telling you I want to share your name
Then we can leave
Then we can leave
My half-heart necklace is for youEmbed
