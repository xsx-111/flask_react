Heartbeat LyricsMagnetic to me in a southern Spanish bar
Ordered another round of cheap Jägermeister
I dragged myself across a chipboard dancefloor
I didn’t know who I admired anymore
Maybe I should be alone
I can see my cover’s blown
Skipping out of time on repeat
Just like my heartbeat
I wake up early and I collapse in a heap
Thinking of the chance I missed
Last night I couldn’t sleep
It’s possible that I was too much for you baby
I wasn’t used to being on my own maybe
But it’s good to be alone
I can see my cover’s blown
Skipping out of time on repeat
Just like my heartbeat
Should we keep pretending this is never ending
I don’t think so
They say it just takes time
This time has got me on my knees
Do you remember when we felt invincible
I’m starting to think true romance is fictional
I wish I could make you feel better in my way
Get out of this place maybe go on holiday
But it’s good to be alone
I can see my cover’s blown
Skipping out of time on repeat
Just like my heartbeatEmbed
