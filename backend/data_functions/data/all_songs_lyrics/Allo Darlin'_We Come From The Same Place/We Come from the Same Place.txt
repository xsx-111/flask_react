We Come from the Same Place LyricsThe first snow’s melting on the ground
And I can see my breath in your silhouette
And I remember what it felt like to be warm
And to be safe in love
And I know I have been holding out, and now something’s got to give
But these pictures on your wall make it all feel so out of reach
I’m afraid I’ll fade away
And I have to fight the urge to run away
Please believe me I’ve never said this before
When we have an awkward call at the airport
It seems crazy I know, but I’ve got this idea that we’ve met before
And we come from the same place
When I tell you these things
I’m really talking to myself
I can’t say everything will be ok
I’m just trying to make it through another Tuesday
It gives you goose bumps on your skin
I can’t talk my tongue is tied
You’re not feeling very well, and I can’t tell
If I’m sleeping or awake again, or dreaming, or awake
Please believe me, I’ve never said this before
When we have an awkward call at the airport
It seems crazy I know, but I’ve got this idea that we’ve met before
And we come from the same placeEmbed
