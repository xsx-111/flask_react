Romance and Adventure LyricsI read cover to cover
Romance and adventure
It was all a waste of time
Can’t get you out of my mind
And I just couldn’t believe
You’re now someone else’s baby
Put it on the shelf
Replace with someone else
And when you say these things to me
And you open up your arms
I don’t only think of me
I’m just tired of being strong
Early in the morning
I received the warning
Sure as night becomes the day
Romantics end up the same way
I saw you in the prism
Reeling against realism
Hide in fantasy
You wave back at me
And when you say these things to me
And you open up your arms
I don’t only think of me
I’m just tired of being strongEmbed
