Santa Maria Novella LyricsI see your eyes burning with frustration and wet with tears
So I take you for a walk, and our footsteps together will free the talk
A city radiating light, it feels like we’re in black and white
Did I sound convincing? Bitterness has no place here
And I know that no-one likes a tourist I feel like I’m one here
And I realise of course, we’ll criticise what’s corny
But I like the way it looks, and I think you’re brave
It’s hard to overcome, but it will cut you like a knife
In the middle of the night, when you should be sleeping
But you just stare at the ceiling
Past countless souvenir shops, tried hard to make you laugh
By Santa Maria Novella, I remember how
And I know that no-one likes a tourist I feel like I’m one here
And I realise of course, we’ll criticise what’s corny
But I like the way it looks, and I think you’re brave
In an orange alley, I can hear the auto-tune echo from a radio
It all sounds the same, but we don’t know the names
And I know that no-one likes a tourist I feel like I’m one here
And I realise of course, we’ll criticise what’s corny
But I like the way it looks, and I think you’re braveEmbed
