History Lessons LyricsI don’t believe in fate but I’ve been feeling differently of late
Caught in a wave I didn’t catch and no turning back
And if I began to doubt that I had any room left for you in my heart
To my surprise I’ve realised I’m lost in this crowd
You’re studying history to know where you’re coming from
No idea where I was headed, but I feel the weight it’s strong
And I believe we can make it, but the burn has left its mark
You can try and live in the moment, and I’ll contain my rebel heart
I’ll take the day off work I said, my coffee cup left a ring on your A-Z
These sacred streets lead us to the aquarium
You want to see the Lion King, I want to feel the light you bring
Jellyfish glow so fluorescent, I let myself begin
You’re studying history to know where you’re coming from
No idea where I was headed, but I feel the weight it’s strong
And I believe we can make it, but the burn has left its mark
You can try and live in the moment, and I’ll contain my rebel heart
And this city has a memory, but it banks on its history
And places come and places go, I feel stronger letting go
But I want you to remember this
What came before doesn’t have to have been the best
Present becomes the past you realize what you’ve missed
You’re studying history to know where you’re coming from
No idea where I was headed, but I feel the weight it’s strong
And I believe we can make it, but the burn has left its mark
You can try and live in the moment, and I’ll contain my rebel heart1Embed
