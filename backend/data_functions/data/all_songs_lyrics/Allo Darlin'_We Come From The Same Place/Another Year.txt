Another Year LyricsAs I board a no-frills plane
Confidence starts to wane
Hands tighten on the rests when the engine makes a test
And when the wheels tuck under
My heart is louder than thunder
Above is relentless blue sky
Below trees capped with snow
And as I race through the sky I wonder, at 500 miles an hour
Will it be worth the pain?
What if my heart breaks up again?
We blink and before we know it, another year goes
Another year will lead us back here
In another year we won’t be alone
And when we finally land, can’t feel my fingers or my toes
And I don’t know if I will have the courage to say “hello”
We blink and before we know it, another year goes
Another year will lead us back here, in another year we won’t be alone
And I’ve been staring at you so long, my tea’s gone cold
And I can recognize these scars for what they are
We blink and before we know it, another year goes
Another year will lead us back here
In another year we won’t be aloneEmbed
