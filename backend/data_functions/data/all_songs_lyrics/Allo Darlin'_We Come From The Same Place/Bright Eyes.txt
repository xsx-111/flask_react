Bright Eyes LyricsWhen I watched you get undressed that was my Achilles heel
Then you took my cigarettes so what else will you steal?
Do yourself a favour, start before you tear yourself apart
Recent events make this heart unwind
And I’m aware I am a southern witch, but I’m predisposed to your kiss
When I’m with you I leave the dark behind
Do you believe in fun? (I surely do)
Do you believe in love? (I do if you ask me to)
I feel better hanging out with you
And I was dreaming (you’re always dreaming)
I found a reason (baby don’t start teasing)
Bright Eyes here’s to looking back at you
And when the sun gets up I’ll bring you marmalade
And in the afternoon we’ll drink lime in the shade
Somehow I have found myself lost in this circumstance
But you go to great lengths to tell me this is not a romance
What’s the hurry don’t you see?
The best part’s in not knowing
We can take our time
You don’t have to worry
Do you believe in fun? (I surely do)
Do you believe in love? (I do if you ask me to)
I feel better hanging out with you
And I was dreaming (you’re always dreaming)
I found a reason (baby don’t start teasing)
Bright Eyes here’s to looking back at youEmbed
