Crickets in the Rain LyricsBack in 1992
Sometimes dreams really did come true
I kissed you in a swimming pool
Your lips were sweet from the Juicy Fruit
Later as a refrain
I heard crickets singing in the rain
And the Weather With You, floating through
Fluorescent blue lights in the haze
And nothing feels the way it did before
And I am grateful for that
The truth is when I realised I loved you
It was like everything I had ever lost had come back
Driving round in your car
Start to feel a little older
And somehow I learned to never accept
The things that I didn’t deserve
Walking past the reservoir
And the place where he fell when he saw the stars
I tried to hold on tighter to you
But I felt you slip through my grasp
And nothing feels the way it did before
And I am grateful for that
The truth is when I realised I loved you
It was like everything I had ever lost had come back
And the night is warm, you turn a sprinkler on
There’s an apricot sky over the city lights
And I have a sense that somehow this will end
But I am going forward, never to go back again
And nothing feels the way it did before
And I am grateful for that
The truth is when I realised I loved you
It was like everything I had ever lost had come back
Last saw you in a carpark
Reading Joan Didion in the dark
“It’s easy to see where things begin
It is harder to see where they end”Embed
