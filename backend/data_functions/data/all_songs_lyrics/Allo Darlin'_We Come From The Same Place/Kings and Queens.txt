Kings and Queens LyricsIn a dusty town of student bars
We sang our hearts out to a drunken crowd
They can call us what they want be we know
That we are the kings and queens of love
This is what it is to be young
The stillness of the warm night hums
I can’t pretend to be sure of myself
But I’ll finish the bottle with your help
And I wanted to impress you
And I think you knew
What we have, we know that they’ll never have
This is all I needed
I find it hard to put myself on the line
And the world is spinning wine
The consequence of this feeling
Sunburned lips reeling
On a bus, on a train, in a van on a plane
Across the Pacific, caught in a dream
You can’t imagine how happy it made me
To look out in the crowd and see you smile at me
And I wanted to impress you
And I think you knew
What we have, we know that they’ll never have
This is all I needed
In a dusty town of student bars
You sang your heart out to the drunken crowd
They can call us what they want be we know
That we are the kings and queens of loveEmbed
