Angela LyricsIf I had more than a penny
I’d take this flight to New York City
And come see you in your apartment
And try not to be another disappointment
Oh Angela
You were born with the darkest eyes that have seen it all
And the hardest thing we ever have to learn
Is when those we love don’t love us in return
Well I want to drink some wine, and I want to kick off my shoes
Dance in my stockings in the kitchen with you
And you can drink me under the table
I’ll go along with it, so you can forget I’m not him
Oh Angela
You were born with the darkest eyes that have seen it all
And the hardest thing we ever have to learn
Is when those we love don’t love us in return
I know that we are friends
I don’t know where love goes when it ends
But lovers come and lovers go
I’d like to stay and I wanted you to know
Oh Angela
You were born with the darkest eyes that have seen it all
And the hardest thing we ever have to learn
Is when those we love don’t love us in returnEmbed
