Supernaturally LyricsThrough the windswept coastal trees
Where the dead come rising from the sea
With a teddy-bear clamped between her knees
She says, where can my loverman be?
Well, I'm down here, babe, with the Eskimos
With the polar bears and the Arctic snow
With a party of penguins who do not know
How I can get back to thee
Well I'm gonna ask you, babe

Hey! Ho! Oh baby don't you go
Hey! Ho! Oh no no no
Hey! Ho! Oh baby, don't you go all supernatural on me
Supernaturally
Once I was your hearts desire
Now I am the ape hunkered by the fire
With my knuckles dragging through the mire
You float by so majestically
You're my north, my south, my east, my west
You are the girl that I love best
With an army of tanks bursting from your chest
I wave my little white flag at thee
Well, can you see it, babe?
Hey! Ho! Oh baby don't you go
Hey! Ho! Oh no no no
Hey! Ho! Oh baby, don't you go all supernatural on me
Supernaturally
Now I've turned the mirrors to the wall
And I've emptied out the peopled halls
And I've nailed shut the windows and I've locked the doors
There is no escape, you see
I chase you up and down the stairs
Under tables and over chairs
Well, I reach out and I touch your hair
And it cuts me like a knife
For there is always some little thing you gotta do

Hey! Ho! Oh baby don't go
Hey! Ho! Oh baby no no no
Hey! Ho! Oh, don't you go all supernatural on me
