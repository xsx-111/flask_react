Nature Boy LyricsI was just a boy when I sat down to watch the news on TV
I saw some ordinary slaughter, I saw some routine atrocity
My father said, don't look away, you gotta be strong, you got to be bold now
He said, that in the end it is beauty that is going to save the world now

And she moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
She moves something deep inside of me

I was walking around the flower show like a leper coming down with some kind of nervous hysteria
I saw you standing there, green eyes, black hair up against the pink and purple wisteria
You said, hey, nature boy, are you looking at me with some unrighteous intention?
My knees went weak, I couldn't speak, I was having thoughts that were not in my best interests to mention

And she moves among the flowers
And she floats upon the smoke
She moves among the shadows
She moves me with just one little look

You took me back to your place and dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit
You played the patriot, you raised the flag and I stood at full salute
Later on we smoked a pipe that struck me dumb and made it impossible to speak
As you closed in, in slow motion quoting Sappho, in the original Greek
She moves among the shadows
She floats upon the breeze
She moves among the candles
And we moved through the days
And through the years

Years passed by, we were walking by the sea, half delirious
You smiled at me and said, Babe, I think this thing is getting kind of serious
You pointed at something and said have you ever seen such a beautiful thing?
It was then that I broke down, it was then that you lifted me up again

She moves among the sparrows
And she walks across the sea
She moves among the flowers
And she moves something deep inside of me
She moves among the sparrows
And she floats upon the breeze
She moves among the flowers
And she moves right up close to me2Embed
