Hiding All Away Lyrics
You went looking for me dear
Down by the sea
You found some little silver fish
But you didn't find me

I was hiding, dear
Hiding all way
I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all way

You went to the museum
You climbed a spiral stair
You searched for me all among
The knowledgeable air

I was hidden, babe
I was hiding all away
I was hidden, dear
I was hiding all away

You entered the cathedral
When you heard the solemn knell
I was not sitting with the gargoyles
I was not swinging from the bell
I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away
I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away

You asked an electrician
If he'd seen me around his place
He touched you with his fingers
Sent sparks zapping out your face

I was hidden, dear
I was hiding all away
I was not there, dear
I was hiding all away

You went and asked your doctor
To get some advice
He shot you full of Pethadine
And then he went and billed you twice

But I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away
But I was hiding, dear
Hiding all away
You approached a high court judge
You thought he'd be on the level
Well he wrapped a rag around your face
And beat you with his gavel

I was hiding, babe
I was hiding all away
I was keeping hidden, dear
I was hiding all away

You asked at the local constabulary
They said, he's up to his same old tricks
They leered at you with their baby blues
And rubbed jelly on their sticks

I had to get out of there, babe
I was hiding all away
You better get out of there, dear
I was hiding all away

You searched through all my poets
From Sappho through to Auden
I saw the book fall from your hands
As you slowly died of boredom
I had been there, dear
But I was not there anymore
I had been there, dear
Now I'm hiding all way

You walked into the ball of fame
And approached my imitators
Some were stuffing their faces with caviar
Some were eating cold potatoes

But I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away
I was hiding, dear
I was hiding all away

Well, you asked a famous cook if he'd seen me
He opened his oven wide
Well, he basted you with butter, babe
And made you crawl inside

But I was not in there, dear
I was hiding all away
I was not in there, dear
I was hiding all away

You asked the butcher
Who lifted up his cleaver
Stuck his fist up your dress
Said he must've been mad to leave you

But I had to get away, dear
I was hiding all away
I had to get away, dear
I was hidden all away

Some of us we hide away
Some of us we don't
Some will live to love another day
And some of us won't
But we all know there is a law
And that law, it is love
And we all know there's a war coming
Coming from above
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming
There is a war coming2Embed
