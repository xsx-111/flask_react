Get Ready for Love Lyrics
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Get ready for love!

Well, most of all nothing much ever really happens
And God rides high up in the ordinary sky
Until we find ourselves at out most distracted
And the miracle that was promised creeps quietly by

Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Praise Him!

The mighty wave their hankies from their high-windowed palace
Sending grief and joy down in supportable doses
And we search high and low without mercy or malice
While the gate to the kingdom swings shut and closes

Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Praise Him till you've forgotten
What you're praising Him for
Praise Him till you've forgotten
What you're praising Him for
Then praise Him a little bit more
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more
Praise Him till you've forgotten
What you're praising Him for
Praise Him till you've forgotten what
You're praising Him for
Praise Him a little bit more
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Get ready!

I searched the seven seas and I've looked under the carpet
And browsed through the brochures that govern the skies
Then I was just hanging around doing nothing and looked up to see
His face burned in the retina of your eyes

Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Calling every boy and girl
Calling all around the world
Get ready for love! Praise Him!
Get ready for love! Praise Him!Embed
