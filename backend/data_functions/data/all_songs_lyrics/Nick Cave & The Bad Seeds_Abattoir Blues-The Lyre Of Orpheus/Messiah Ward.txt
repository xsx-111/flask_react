Messiah Ward LyricsI hope you're sitting comfortably
I saved you the best seat in the house right up in the front row
The stars have been torn down and the moon is locked away
The land is banked in frozen snow
You are a force of nature, dear
And your breath curls from your lips
And the trees bend down their branches
To touch you with their fingertips

They're bringin' out the dead now
It's easy, well, just to look away
They are bringin' out the dead now
It's been a strange, strange day
We could navigate our position by the stars
But they've taken out the stars
Well the stars have all gone
And I'm glad you've come along
We could comprehend our condition by the moon
But they've ordered the moon not to shine
Still, I'm glad you've come along
I was worried out of my mind
'Cause they keep bringin' out the dead now
And it's easy just to look away
They're bringin' out the dead
And it's been a long, strange day
You can move up a little closer
I'll throw a blanket over
We can weigh all the tears in one hand
Against the laughter in the other
We could be hangin' 'round for centuries
Trying to make sense of this, my dear
While the planets try to get organized
Way above the stratosphere

But they keep bringin' out the dead, now
And it's easy if we just walk away
'Cause they keep bringin' out the dead, now
It's been a long, long day
Look away
