Bad Light LyricsNever forever, what I think is true
Never forever, what I hope to do
Never forever, what I got from you
Never forever
Never forever, what I think is true
Never forever, what I hope to do
Never forever, what I got from you
Never forever
And all that sun makes so much shine
How this is done like so much science
Can't be explained through common sense
Takes a firm background in remembering
And it takes some math
And there's so much more
It's so hard to read in bad light
It's so hard to read in bad light
It's so hard to see in bad light
It's so hard to see in bad light1Embed
