You Were Right LyricsYou were wrong when you said everything's gonna be alright
You were wrong when you said everything's gonna be alright
You were right when you said all that glitters isn't gold
You were right when you said all we are is dust in the wind
You were right when you said we're all just bricks in the wall
And when you said manic depression's a frustrated mess
You were wrong when you said everything's gonna be alright
You were wrong when you said everything's gonna be alright
You were wrong when you said everything's gonna be alright
You were right when you said you can't always get what you want
You were right when you said it's a hard rain's gonna fall
You were right when you said we're still running against the wind
Life goes on long after the thrill of living is gone
You were right when you said this is the end
Do you ever think about it?
Do you ever think about it?
Do you ever think about it?
Do you ever think about it?2Embed
