Time Trap Lyrics
It's barely yours on loan
What you think you own
The place that you call home
The ideas in your bones
In your bones

This would still feel dumb
Back where you're from
(Do you) Do you want to change your mind?
Do you want to change your mind?

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap
In a time trap

Guess that's all fair now because
Guess that's all there ever was
Grey and sprawling
Save your crawling

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap
In a time trap
Do you want to save your life?
Do you want to save your life?

'Cause you could never know that
In a time trap
In a time trapEmbed
