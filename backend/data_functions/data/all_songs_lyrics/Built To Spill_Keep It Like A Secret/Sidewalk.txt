Sidewalk LyricsCome on, break it up
It's gone on long enough
What has it changed for you?
What has it changed for you?
The tubes tag along
The radar's got it wrong
What hasn't changed for you?
What hasn't changed for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Waiting for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Can it wait for you?
Come on, break it up
It's gone on long enough
What has it changed for you?
What has it changed for you?
The tubes tag along
The radar's got it wrong
What hasn't changed for you?
What hasn't changed for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Waiting for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Can it wait for you?
Can you wait for the sidewalk
Can it wait for you?Embed
