Else LyricsFinally, I don't mind
Worthless tries at finding something else
Best not talk too loud
You're not as smart as you require of them
Your body breaks, your needs consume you forever
And with this lies the need to be here together
Funny thing with blood
You try to stand but neither leg's awake
Just this side of love
Is where you'll find the confidence not to continue
Your body breaks, your needs consume you forever
And with this lies the need to be here together3Embed
