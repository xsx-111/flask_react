Temporarily Blind LyricsBet you can't tell I'm
Temporarily blind
And how much more can I
Get sunburned?
How much more can I
Get sunburned?
Bet you can't tell I'm
Temporarily blind
There’s one in everyone
There’s one in everyone
There’s one in everyone
There’s one in everyone
There’s one in everyone
There’s one in everyone
There’s one in everyone
There’s one in everyone
The thought of you waiting
For so long
Turn your back on this hating
Turn your back on this hating
Before I forget it
Took so long
Turn your back on this waiting
Turn your back on this waiting
I need to know where you're
Coming from
Turn your back on the framing
Turn your back on the framing
Who history doesn't teach
It makes numb
Turn your back on their taming
Turn your back on their taming, yeah
Yeah, they might let let you say it
But it'd take all day to explain itEmbed
