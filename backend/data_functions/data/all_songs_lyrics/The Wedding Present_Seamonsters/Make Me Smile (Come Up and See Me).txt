Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) LyricsYou've done it all
You've broken every ....
Robbed the rebel .... the ....
You ... the game
No matter what you say
... .. . ... . . . 
Your lies, your lies
How can you tell so many lies
Come up and see me, make me smile
I'll do what you want for a while
There's nothing left, oh ... and run away
Oh maybe you'll tarry for a while
It's just a test, a game for us to play
Win or lose, it's hard to smile
Resist, resist, it's ... you have to hide
Come up and see me, make me smile
I'll do what you want for a while
There ain't no more, you've taken everything
... ...
Can you ignore my faith in everything
'Cos I know what they do, what it's worth
..., ..., don't say maybe you'll try
To come up and see me, make me smile
I'll do what you want for a while
Come up and see me, make me smile
I'll do what you want for a whileEmbed
