Corduroy LyricsAnd now I've kissed you, I'll show you how I've missed you
Before you even say a word, I already heard
No, someone told me, but don't speak now just hold me
You wandered up a cul-de-sac, and now you've come back
So did you leave him? I'm sure you didn't deceive him
Just the same you're here today, wanting to stay
Have I upset you? Well I tried hard to forget you
Now you say "Look, I came, let's try again..."
I'll make you laugh, when you see this photograph
It's not from that day, I threw all those away
Its just some boy, probably dressed in corduroy
He grew up fast, but you've not changed at all
How can I trust you? No, I'm not trying to rush you
But I was here when you ran; I don't think I can
I won't desert her and I'm not about to hurt her
I worshipped you once before, and you slammed the door
I'll make you laugh, when you see this photograph
It's not from that day, I threw all those away
Its just some boy, probably dressed in corduroy
He grew up fast, but you've not changed at allEmbed
