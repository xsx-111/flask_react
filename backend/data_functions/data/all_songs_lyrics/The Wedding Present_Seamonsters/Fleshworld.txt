Fleshworld LyricsHey you, don't come near me
God, how did you find this place?
You just brought me misery
I don't want to see your face
I don't think you hear me
How can I make this clear?
I just said don't come near me
You don't belong down here
Something deep down in fleshworld
No I don't want to know
No I will not drink your drink
Go find someplace to hide
I don't care what you think
You don't set foot inside
Do you remember this?
It must have seemed like fun
Well you've had your hour of bliss
Those things should not be done
Something deep down in fleshworld
No I don't want to go
I will not drink your drink
Go find someplace to hide
I don't care what you think
You don't set foot inside
Do you remember this?
It must have seemed like fun
Well you had your hour of bliss
Those things should not be done
I don't think you hear me
How can I make this clear?
I just said don't come near me
You don't belong down here
Hey you don't come near me
God, how did you find this place?
You just brought me misery
I don't want to see your face
Something deep down in fleshworld
No I don't want to knowEmbed
