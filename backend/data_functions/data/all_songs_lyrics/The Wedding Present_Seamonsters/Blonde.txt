Blonde LyricsI'm just some name in your book
That's why you gave up writing weeks ago
You won't be getting in touch
Oh do you ever?
And I meant every word that I said
Oh did I try too hard? Oh I don't know
You made sure it wouldn't happen again
Oh you're clever
Yes I was that na誰ve
Yes I was that na誰ve
You've heard this all before
You've heard this all before
I'm just some name in your book
That's why you gave up writing weeks ago
You won't be getting in touch
Oh do you ever?
Yes I was that na誰ve
Yes I was that na誰ve
You've heard this all before
You've heard this all before
I still can't believe
I still can't believe
That's all you took me for
That's all you took me forEmbed
