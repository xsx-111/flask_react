Rotterdam LyricsI thought you'd come round
And I know how this will sound
I said so much yesterday that I shouldn't have
So what did I do
After I talked to you?
I should have gone home straightaway but I couldn't have
Oh I stayed with you and my heart began to sink
I wanted you but not the way you think
So what did I say?
I didn't mean it anyway
And I don't want anything that I should do
I know you're sad
Believe me I'm feeling bad
If I could change everything then I would do
Oh I stayed with you and my heart began to sink
Oh I wanted you but not the way you thinkEmbed
