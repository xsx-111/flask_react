Carolyn LyricsJust before you go today
There's something that I've got to say
Well you asked me what was wrong
And I didn't want to tell you
You believed me when I said I tried
But oh, Carolyn, I lied
And it's gone on far too long
And I never tried to help you
But don't wait up for me
Just don't wait up for me
It isn't quite the way you think
How low do you suppose I'd sink?
We can't bear to be apart
Oh I'm sorry that I said that
But come on now let's not pretend
We both knew we were near the end
I don't want to break your heart
But we just can't turn the clock back
But don't wait up for me
Just don't wait up for me
