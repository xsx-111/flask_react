Lovenest LyricsI heard another voice this morning on the phone
But just the other day I thought you said you slept alone
And yes, I knew that laughter, okay now I see
You wouldn't even know him if it hadn't been for me
Sometimes in the fading light
I can't help thinking back to, well, the way we were
And then I start feeling guilty lying next to her
I know and it can't be right
Pretending that its you
You still won't go away
Pretending that its you
You still won't go away
If you write again perhaps you shouldn't send it here
It's just that I don't really want your letters to appear
Oh no, I just think she might
Forget I ever said that I'm just being scared
I told her all about you and I don't think she even cared
I know but its not all right
Pretending that its you
You still won't go away
Pretending that its you
You still won't go away
And does the thought of leaving him bring you to tears?
I bet you never felt the same about me all those years
Well you know just what it's like
Pretending that its you
You still won't go away
Pretending that its you
You still won't go awayEmbed
