Octopussy LyricsSome bits of snow still hanging in the air
But that's outside
Take off your clothes and lie down over there
Oh that's just right
I sat by this window and just watched for you
No you weren't late
There was a thousand things I had to do
They can all wait
You don't take away my hand like you ought to
You've become my family
I don't want to understand why I need you
You've just become my family
I lay down there and watch you getting dressed
It's still so clear
You laughed and pulled your knees up to your chest
If I came near
God knows I've always had to fear the worst
But not that time
You brought me home and then you kissed me first
And you were all mine
You don't take away my hand like you ought to
You've become my family
I don't want to understand why I need you
You've just become my family
You don't take away my hand like you ought to
You've become my family
I don't want to understand why I need you
You've just become my family
We don't have to do anything
We don't have to do anything
Except watch the leaves turning in the wind
Say what you want to say
We don't have to go anywhere
We don't have to go anywhere
Let's just sit and talk about the usual things
I couldn't move anywayEmbed
