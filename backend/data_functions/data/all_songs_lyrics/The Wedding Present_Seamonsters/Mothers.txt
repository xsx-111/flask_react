Mothers LyricsIt's really not my way dear
To step on other people's feet
But now it must be deepening
'Cause you were going out with him
'Cause you were going out with him
'Cause you were going out with him
It's not the same in this town
Since the boy has flipped his lid
And it wasn't meant to drag him down
But that's exactly what it did
'Cause part of him still wants you
But part of him is still with you
I'm not paralyzed by fear
But this whole thing makes me pretty sick
And now I sit and think and wait
For him to take it out on me
For him to take it out on me
'Cause you were going out with him
For him to take it out on me
'Cause part of him is still with youEmbed
