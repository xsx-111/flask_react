Niagara Lyrics
Oh no, my life had not begun until your call
Was it only yesterday?
I can't believe the things we've done since then
And, God, I love the way you taste
But does it have to end right now?
Well, can't you stay for another day?
Just say you're ill and come back out
I'll meet you here, then we'll disappear

I've got this feeling
Oh, it's like nothing I know
You sent me reeling
And I don't want you to go

Don't say a word, it's almost light
I'll always remember how you look right now
We must have talked and talked all night
All I heard was Niagara falling down

I've got this feeling
Oh, it's like nothing I know
You sent me reeling
And I don't want you to go
(One, two, three, four)
