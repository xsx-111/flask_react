Heather LyricsI tried to call
You'd just gone out
We've got to talk
You going to be about?
Oh you don't have to tell me where you've been
It's bad enough I know you were with him
What makes you want to take him there?
What makes you think I wouldn't care?
And did you walk from the town into the heather
To where we used to lie down when we were together?
No I walked by
I sort of knew
I don't know why
Maybe I'll ask you
You don't have to tell me lies today
I saw him sat there waiting anyway
But what makes you want to take him there?
What makes you think I wouldn't care?
And did you walk from the town into the heather
To where we used to lie down when we were together?
And I know I said
I wouldn't be the one
But an empty bed
Your clothes all gone
I didn't know how much I'd miss you until now
I didn't know how much you mean to me somehow
What makes you want to take him there?
What makes you think I wouldn't care?
And did you walk from the town into the heather
To where we used to lie down when we were together? (ohh)Embed
