Light My Way Lyrics
In my hour of need
On a sea of grey
On my knees I pray to you
Help me find the dawn
Of the dying day

Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way

A bullet is a man
From time to time he strays
I compare my life to this
To this I relate
And I'm willing
To listen to your answers
And I'm not afraid
To tell you I need you today

Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
So when I'm lost
Or I'm tired and depraved
Or when my high bullet mind
Goes astray
Won't you light my way

Don't save it for another day
Don't save it for another day
Don't save it for another day
Don't save it for another day

Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my way
Won't you light my wayEmbed
