The Last Remaining Light Lyrics
Roll me on your frozen fields
Break my bones to watch them heal
Drowned me in your thirsty veins
Where I'll watch and I'll wait
And pray for the rain
Curl like smoke and breathe again
Down your throat, inside your ribs
Through your spine, and every nerve
Where I watch and I wait
And yield to the hurt

And if you don't believe the sun will rise
Stand alone and greet the coming night
In the last remaining light

The seven moons and the seven suns
Heaven waits for those who run
Down your winter and underneath your waves
Where you watch and you wait
And pray for the day

And if you don't believe the sun will rise
Stand alone and greet the coming night
In the last remaining light
And if you don't believe the sun will rise
Stand alone and greet the coming night
In the last remaining light

Light
Light
