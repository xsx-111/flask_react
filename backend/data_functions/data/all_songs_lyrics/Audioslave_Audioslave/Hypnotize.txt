Hypnotize Lyrics
Well if you set your mind upon it, I know that you can
You've got everything you wanted
You've done everything you planned
So let me make an offer
I'm only trying to help
You can make your load just a little lighter
All you got to do is share the wealth

Oh no don't you keep your
Good luck to yourself
Oh no don't you keep your
Good luck to yourself

Well I know you've got problems
I see it in your eyes
But if you want to live to see the morning
Give it up to your brother
Or you'll get a surprise

Oh no don't you keep your
Good luck to yourself
Oh no don't you keep your
Good luck to yourself
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
(Well, it's time to see
You got to give all you're going to receive
Hey, It's time to see
You got to give if you want to believe
You won't breathe)

Oh no don't you keep your
Good luck to yourself
Oh no don't you keep your
Good luck to yourself
Oh no don't you keep your
Good luck to yourself
Oh no don't you keep your
Good luck to yourself1Embed
