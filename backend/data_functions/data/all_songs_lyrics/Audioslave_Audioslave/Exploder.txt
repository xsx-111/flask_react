Exploder Lyrics
I met a man locked away for things he hadn't done
Innocence on ball and chain
He'll never feel the sun
Again on his face, or roses in his hands
But when he smiled at me, I could understand

If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear at all

There was a daughter of a man who took his life too young
She swore she'd never do the same then did just what he'd done
And a boy who's gone insane, heard voices in his head
No one knows what they say, now his mother's dead

If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear at all

There was a man who had a face that looked a lot like me
I saw him in the mirror and I fought him in the street
Then when he turned away, I shot him in the head
Then I came to realize, I had killed myself
If you're free you'll never see the walls
If your head is clear you'll never free fall
If you're right you'll never fear the wrong
If your head is high you'll never fear4Embed
