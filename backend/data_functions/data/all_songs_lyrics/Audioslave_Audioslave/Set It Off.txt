Set It Off Lyrics
He was standing at the rock, gathering the flock
And getting there with no directions
And underneath the arch it turned into a march
And there he found the spark to set this fucker off

Set it off, set it off now children, set it right
Set it off, set it off now children, alright
Set it off, set it off now children, set a fire
Set it off, set it off now children

Suddenly a shot ripped into his heart
And he lay in need of some attention
And there he played his card, going into shock
The last thing that he said was, set this fucker off

Set it off, set it off now children, set it right
Set it off, set it off now children, alright
Set it off, set it off now children, set a fire
Set it off, set it off now children

Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Jesus at the back door, everything is all right
All we need is some direction
Every time the wind blows
Everything you don't know turns into a revelation
And it all adds up inside your head
Time is wasting

Set it off, set it off now children, set it right
Set it off, set it off now children, alright
Set it off, set it off now children, set a fire
Set it off, set it off now children

Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright1Embed
