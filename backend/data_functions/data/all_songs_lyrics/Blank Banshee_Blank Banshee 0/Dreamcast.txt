Dreamcast LyricsTo go for seconds
A cold decision
Righteous power or only a dud
You're not comin' to me
Show me something
I don't expect you'll turn water to wine
Blood makes the grass grow a little greener
Tells you more than song and dance
The vicious retort out of fear
Tell me who can hold your hand through this

Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes (makes the grass grow)
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow(makes the grass grow)
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes (It's like a heart attack)
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes (makes the grass grow)
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow(makes the grass grow like ooooh)
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes (No one comes back)
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow (No one comes back)
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass grow
Makes, blood makes, blood makes, blood makes
Blood makes, blood makes, blood make-makes the grass growEmbed
