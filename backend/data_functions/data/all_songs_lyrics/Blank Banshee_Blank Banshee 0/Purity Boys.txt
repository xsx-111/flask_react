Purity Boys LyricsEvery time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found
Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out?
What's it all about?
Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good going for myself
But what goes wrong?
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel sad
(Sad)
Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel sad
(Sad)
I guess I just
I guess I just
I guess I just
Wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
(wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't)3Embed
