Visualization LyricsVisualization
Let go of all outside concerns
Close your eyes
Now take a deep breath in
Allow an image to form
Drift more and more into this image
Let it become so real
That you can look around and see the colors and shapes and all the things around you
Imagine that you're doing something you'd like to be doing in a place you'd like to be
Feeling physically strong and emotionally balanced
Take a deep breath in and as you let it out let this scene fade away
But let the good feeling stay with you
When you're ready open your eyesEmbed
