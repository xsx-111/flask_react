So Easy LyricsYou're always saying, it's so easy
Any man I want I'll take him make him mine mine mine
You're always saying, it's so easy
Any man I want I'll take him make him mine mine mine
Less talking, let's see action
There's no time to waste, it's time to make me your man
Less talking, let's see action
There's no time to waste, it's time to make me your man
Do do do doo it's so easy
I hear you praying, it's not easy
You're the man I want but I can't make you mine mine mine
I hear you praying, it's not easy
You're the man I want but I can't make you mine mine mine
Less talking let's see action there's no time to waste
It's time to make you understand
Less talking let's see action there's no time to waste
It's all according to the plan
Do do do do, it's so easy
Do do do do, it's so easy
Do do do do, it's so easy
Do do do do, it's so easy
Do do do do, it's so easy
Do do do do, it's so easy
Do do do do, it's so easy
Do do do do, it's so easy
It's so easy
It's so easy
It's so easyEmbed
