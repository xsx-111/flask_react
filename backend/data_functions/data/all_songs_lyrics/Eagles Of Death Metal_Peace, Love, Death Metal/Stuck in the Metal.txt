Stuck in the Metal LyricsWell, I don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'm gon' get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Yeah, I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm stuck in the metal with you
And I'm wondering what it is I should do
It's so hard to wipe this smile from my face
Lose control, yeah, I'm all over the place
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, please"
Trying to make some sense of it all
But I can see it makes no sense at all
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
'Cause I don't think that I can take anymore
Well, you started out with nothing
And you're proud you're a self-made man
And your friends, they all come crawling
Slap you on the back and say, "Please, please"
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you
Ow, here I am
Don't know why I came here tonight
I got the feeling something ain't right
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair
And I'm wondering how I'm gon' get down the stairs
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right
Here I am, stuck in the middle with you, oohEmbed
