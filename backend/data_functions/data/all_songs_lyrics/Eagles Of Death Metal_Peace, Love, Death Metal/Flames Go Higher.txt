Flames Go Higher Lyrics1,2,3,4
Yeah
I'm gonna set my soul on fire
My heart beats low while the flames go higher
Strike the match and then the truth is told
I'm gonna set my soul on fire
The devil made me a Woman, I ain't no liar
Her eyes burn black like the lake of fire
She struck the match and then I sold my soul
For the black-haired girl from the lake of fire
I'm gonna set my soul on fire
My heart beats low while the flames go higher
Strike the match and then the truth is told
I just set my soul on fireEmbed
