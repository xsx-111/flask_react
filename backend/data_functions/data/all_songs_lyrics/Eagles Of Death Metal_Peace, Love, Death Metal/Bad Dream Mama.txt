Bad Dream Mama LyricsNow don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's just a bad dream mama
So let's get ourselves together and roll
I'm just a mean machine, so tight and skinny
And my hands are clean
If you wanna come, then you can spend my money
I've got a sixth sense you're a man-eating woman
So sophisticated, so L.A
Don't try to be too smart
You might just find you'll miss the best part
I'm here right now, I want to be your monkey, ow
Well, don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's just a bad dream mama
So let's get ourselves together and roll
I'm just a mean machine, so tight and skinny
And my hands are clean
If you wanna come, then you can spend my money
I've got a sixth sense you're a man-eating woman
So sophisticated, so L.A
Don't try to be too smart
You might just find you'll miss the best part
I'm here right now, I want to be your monkey
I'm here right now, it's time to love your monkey
I'm here right now, I want to be your monkey
I'm here right now, it's time to love your monkey
I'm here right now, I want to be your monkey
I'm here right now, it's time to love your monkeyEmbed
