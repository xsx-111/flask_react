English Girl LyricsMy face is stuck in a Cheshire grin
I met an English girl
She's like the toast of my whole world
We hit the gas just in order to get away
Ooh ooh ooh
And then we dance all through the whole night
Ooh ooh ooh
Then we dance all through the whole night
We'll storm the beaches, head to Mexico
We'll cruise the streets all night
And catch a rock and roll show
We have to do this just in order to get away
Ooh ooh ooh
And then we dance all through the whole night
Ooh ooh ooh
Then we dance all through the whole night
Keep dancing
Keep dancing
Keep dancing
Let's keep dancingEmbed
