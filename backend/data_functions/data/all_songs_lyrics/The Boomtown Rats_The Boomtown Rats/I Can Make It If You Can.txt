I Can Make It If You Can LyricsSomewhere a screen door slammed
Somewhere, someplace, somebody's killing a man
Down the road I'm told five people died
And I wonder are you making love to anyone tonight
Cos she and I, we're still sitting here
Our eyes are dry but we're bored to tears
She said lets talk about the future, lets forget about the past
Did I forget to tell you time never lasts
CHORUS:
Can I hold on that long
Is it worth the same old stringalong
There's been a few rights but there's plenty wrongs
I can make it if you can
Don't trust anything, especially love
Be careful of the broken bottles on the wall above
They burn your brain and they tear at your mind
I know I won't be making love to anyone tonight
Cos she and I we're still sitting here
Our eyes are dry but we're bored to tears
Don't talk about the future, please don't talk about the past
Lets forget about the present, it makes me want to laugh
REPEAT CHORUSEmbed
