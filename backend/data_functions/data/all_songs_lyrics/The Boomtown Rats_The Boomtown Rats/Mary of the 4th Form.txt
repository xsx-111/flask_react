Mary of the 4th Form LyricsSittin' in the front row
Mary of the fourth form
Turnin' all the boys on
She's turnin' all their heads around
Hitchin' up her short skirt
Stretchin' out her long legs
Pullin' up her stockings
She's combing out her black hair
Starin' at the teacher
Openin' her lips wide
Shiftin' in her seat, yeah
She slowly moves her hips aside
But in the middle of the night
She wakes her mom to put out the light
Her makeup's on and her jeans are skintight
And she's heading to the Pillar Bar
She walks into the pool hall room
The music's playing, you can see in the gloom
The boys are hanging out around table number five
Well, Johnnie looks all right tonight, she thinks
He gives her a smoke and he buys her a drink
Shoots off a frame and they head off into the night
Mary
Mary of the fourth form
Mary of the fourth form
Mary of the fourth form
Mary of the fourth form
Teacher's losing control
Thankfully, the bell rings
Mary's left all alone
With no one but the teacher
She quickly drops her pencil
And slowly bends to get it
Well, the teacher is a natural man
His hand moves out to touch her
She straightens and looks around, now
She laughs and leaves the room, yeah
Heartbreak for the teacher
And sweet dreams for young Mary
But in the middle of the night
She wakes her dad to put out the light
Her makeup's on and her jeans are skintight
And she's headed to the Pillar Bar
She walks into the pool hall room
The music's playing, you can see in the gloom
The boys are hanging out around table number five
Well, Johnnie looks great tonight, she thinks
He gives her a smoke and he buys her a drink
Shoots off a frame and they head off into the night
Mary of the fourth form
Mary of the fourth form
Mary of the fourth form
Mary of the fourth form
Mary of the fourth form
Mary of the fourth form
Hey, MaryEmbed
