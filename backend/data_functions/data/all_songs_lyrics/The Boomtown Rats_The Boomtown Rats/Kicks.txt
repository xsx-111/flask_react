Kicks LyricsI don't get my kicks no more from cake or lemonade
Bud I can't get served no smokes or drinks
They tell me that I'm underage
At sixteen years old I don't stand a chance
But on Saturday when I get to the dance
It's time-out from life
Got to learn to boogaloo
'Cos I get my kicks from you
Summer's gone school's back I feel so black inside
Rules and regulations are a torture rack
Is there no place for me left to hide?
At sixteen years old things have gone too far
I wanna be a movie rocker soccer star
But when you're around I know you'll treat me good
I get my kicks from you
I dream of you at night
Do you really mean anything at all
Or am I wasting my time on you?
Those other guys are so much cooler than me
I find it so hard to score
What's it really like to know a girl
My imagination's not enough I gotta know more
At sixteen years old I get frightened at night
Presented with the truth I'm afraid I take flight
But when you're around I know you'll treat me good
I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you
