Neon Heart LyricsLife pours down into the neon heart (It's late at night)
Cement City is all a-spark (Yeah, that's right)
The whores are loose and the dames are abroad (My pants are tight)
A price their hearts you can't fail to afford
Drink to the bitch and we'll dance for a while
If you can't do the module than you'll have to try the slide
It was all cool enough if you had the 'zazz
The night was still young but it was all we had
I picked her up at the bar that night (What did you do?)
I took her home, she didn't put up a fight (What did you do?)
She was real good looking but she, uh, wasn't too bright (So what's new?)
We pulled the curtains and then locked out the night
While I was fighting to maintain my cool
I walked the thin line between animal and fool
Till I felt her hand in mine and said, "You're wrong about me
I'm a boy from a good family", I told her
The jukebox played an out-of-time tune (So what's new?)
Made Tricia cry, oh, her mascara was ruined (So what's new?)
She looked such a sight, the sorrowful bitch (What did she do?)
She rushed to the bathroom and she slashed both her wrists
Everybody screamed and roared for more
Lone Star Angels shouting "Encore"
Time was the enemy, we had to kill it dead
The clock kept creeping 'round, so I went to bed insteadEmbed
