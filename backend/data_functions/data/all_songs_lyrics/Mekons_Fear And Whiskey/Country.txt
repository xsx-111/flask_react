Country LyricsWe know that for many years there's been no country here
Nothing here but the war, and again and again we say
I'm not ready for this, I am not ready for this
Over and over and over, I'm really not ready at all
In a pub on a night off, a man is talking of cars
A girl is ill in a bar and again and again she says
I'm not ready for this, I am not ready for this
Over and over and over, I'm really not ready at all
Did you see me? Did you touch me?
I didn't even know you were here
This night must end, night will come again
How long will I lie here?
They'll wonder where I've gone
They'll wonder where I've gone
They'll wonder
This night must end, night will come again
How long will I lie here?
Did you see me? Did you touch me?
I didn't even know you were here
They'll wonder where I've gone
They'll wonder where I've gone
They'll wonder where I've goneEmbed
