Darkness and Doubt LyricsThe room was filled with flashing lights
They spoke in tongues
Waaah!
Darkness and doubt
Just follow me around
In the clear red dawn
We moved like a tide
But I went down
In a baton charge
Darkness and doubt
Just follow me around
The valley grew still
We drove out at night
My head was split
Oh, oh
Darkness and doubt
Just follow me around
In the evening light
The turn of a coat
A friend gone for good
Oh, woh, oh
Darkness and doubt
Just follow me around
They said come back at ten
And sing the Red Flag
But the hall was cold and bare...
Darkness and doubt
Just follow us about
Ihe room was filled with flashing lights
They spoke in tongues
Darkness and doubt
Just follow me around
Naked we shivered
Out on the moor
Bangagong, get it on
Uh, give me some more
Darkness and doubt
Just follow us about
In the clear red dawn
We moved like a tide
Over the horizon
I saw John Wayne ride
Darkness and doubt
Just followed him aboutEmbed
