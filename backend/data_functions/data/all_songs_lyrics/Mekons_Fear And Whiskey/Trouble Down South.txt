Trouble Down South LyricsThere's trouble down South
Metal keens through the air
Numbers are fallin' one by one
Sky fills with blades
Sound falls from above
Smoke rolls through the trees
Secure that sector
Move up the valley and take it out
Look out for wires
The trucks move out
The village burns
Silence in the swamps
We hear you guys
Avoid strong light
Stay underground
Hold still there
Movement in the dark
Actions getting closer to home
In a clean steel dream
The planes swoop in
All our children coming home
All our children coming home
This is a Priority Two transmission
We have blue air situation
Zip your suits and take your pills
Secure full masks
Magnum leaps from his car
Eyes glint in the hot, hot sun
"Hey guys, where's that plane bound for?"
Over the clouds
Over the clouds
Clear the way
We're coming through
We hear you guys
Avoid strong light (hey!)
Stay underground
We hear you guys
Avoid strong light
Stay underground
Trucks move out
The village burns
Silence in the swamps
Over the hills
Shadows float on the grass
Silver winds brush the trees
Over the hills
In a clean steel dream
The plane swoops in
All our children coming home
All our children coming home
It is imperative to redress the negative body count scenario
All personnel to neutralize the high negative environment
We must stabilize the initial low-security profile
No blank volleys and don't spare the bullets
Weeks, months, a whole year has passed
The dead sleep on but the living have risen
The crowd moves forward again, but now it's different
Revenge is a red flag soaked in a brother's blood
Despots beware, this is the start of our freedom!Embed
