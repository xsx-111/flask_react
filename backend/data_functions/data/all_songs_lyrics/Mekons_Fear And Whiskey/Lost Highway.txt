Lost Highway LyricsI'm a rolling stone, all alone and lonely
For a life of sin I have paid the cost
When I pass by all the people say
Just another guy on the Lost Highway
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two
Neither good or bad, just a kid like you
And now I'm lost, too late to pray
I'm roaring down that Lost Highway
Girls and boys, don't start to ramble around
Or you will find you're sorrow-bound
Take my advice or curse the day
You started rolling down that Lost HighwayEmbed
