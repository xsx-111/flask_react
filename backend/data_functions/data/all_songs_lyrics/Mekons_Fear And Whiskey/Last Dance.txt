Last Dance LyricsThe dance floor's nearly empty now
Everyone's gone home
We're fragmented and broken up
Like love affairs
And as if seeing you for the first time
Something whispered
Looking at you in desperation
Knowing nothing ever happens
I wanted to say fall in love
I wanted to say fall in love with me
I wanted to say fall in love
It'll be alright
So beautiful, you were waltzing
Little frozen rivers all covered with snow
All fragmented and broken up
Oh, weIl I guess it's time to go
I wanted to say fall in love
I wanted to say fall in love with me
I wanted to say fall in love
It'll be alright
You were waltzing
Little frozen rivers all covered with snow
All fragmented and broken up
Oh, weIl I guess it's time to go
But as if seeing you for the first time
Something whispered
Looking at you in desperation
Knowing nothing ever happens
I wanted to say fall in love
I wanted to say fall in love with me
I wanted to say fall in love
It'll be alright
You were waltzing...Embed
