Flitcraft LyricsTake the lid off of life, let me look at the works
It's no accident I changed my name
Long Dead Slim
I went downtown to see if I could find
The woman he said had been on his mind
But she weren't there
We'll pull back the branches and tear up the roots
That's the part I like the best
Born again
He said to me "I don't understand
It happened in thirty-three"
Long Dead Slim
A beam falls at random and you disappear
Like a fist when you open your hand
Long Dead Slim
Jean Paul and me were travelling down south
He wouldn't look me in the eye
Long Dead Slim
Take the lid off of life, let me look at the works
It's no accident I changed my name
Long Dead Slim1Embed
