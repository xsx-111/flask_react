Hard to Be Human Again LyricsI made a mistake
When I looked over my shoulder
Cromwell was right behind me
In the driving rain
I came out of the bathroom
Looking for my ticket
(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again
Well I've been punched and beaten
Though it never shows
I'm going up to Sheffield
I don't know when I'm coming home
He took me in a corner
And I don't know why
I was looking for a friend
He shaved me dry
Never been in trouble
Don't call me on the phone
Put the blower in the bathroom
Burn the house and start from scratch
Searching for existence
With my red, red wine
(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again
(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again
(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human again
There was a caravan
Leaving in the dusk
I saw a man
Hold a chicken to his head
I'm telling you baby
I go up and I come down
(It's hard to be human)
Hard to be human againEmbed
