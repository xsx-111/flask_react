Chivalry LyricsI was out late the other night
Fear and whiskey kept me going
I swore somebody held me tight
But now there's just no way of knowing
I saw your face in a crowded bar
"Excuse me please!"
At least I thought it was you
Now I just don't know where you are
My suit was smart when I put it on last week
All I could remember as I walked down the street
Was the rain and tears on your face
Oh gee, I guess I'm just a disgraceEmbed
