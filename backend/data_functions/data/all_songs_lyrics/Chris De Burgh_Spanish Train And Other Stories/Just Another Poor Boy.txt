Just Another Poor Boy LyricsHe was but a traveller on the lonely road of life
She, her name was Mary, A lady of the night
She found him lying in that road, on a winter's night so cold
Just another poor boy, treat him right
She saw that he was hungry and gave him food to eat
She knew that he was weary an he had no place to sleep
She took him home to her own bed, she lay down his wounded head
And washed away the world from his hands and his knees
He was just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
When he cried out in his sleep she held him tight
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And she gave him love and comfort throught the night
Till the morning light ..
At night she sat beside him, by the fire they would talk
He said all men were brothers and that love could conquer all
Many gathered round to hear, many for his life did fear
In troubled times like these men seldom talk
Oh they came for him one morning at the breaking of the day
She woke to to hear him calling as they carried him away
Accusing him of spreading lies and hate
His public meetings were a danger to the state
Some soldier said " Who was he anyway ??"
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And the tears were falling from her face like rain
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And they hung him on a hillside far away
And on the ground she lay ...Poor boy... Oh, my Lord...
Oh my Lord ... Oh my Lord...
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And the tears were falling from her face like rain
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And the hung him on a hillside far away, just another poor boy
Just another poor boy, Just another poor boy
And she'd never dreamed she'd see his face again ..Embed
