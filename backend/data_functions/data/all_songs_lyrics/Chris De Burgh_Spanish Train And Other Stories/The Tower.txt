The Tower LyricsA great lord came walking through the forest
One morning with a weapon in his hand;
Rich was his castle, he lacked for nothing
But killing was his plan;
When a white bird flew by she fell from the sky
Nothing was found, only blood on the ground, she was gone;
Cursing his fortune
He turned to the forest to kill once again
And standing before him was a lovely young woman
With her hand hung in pain
When he saw her his eyes were filled with desire
He said "I must have her, she must be mine
She will be mine..."
He offered her silver, he offered her gold
But she threw it on the ground
He fell to his knees and he begged her
"Oh please come with me
What you wish will be found;"
She said, "Sir, I'll go if you'll put up your bow
And spare these creatures, leave them in peace
You have no need..."
But her words were lost in the wind
His eyes were fixed on a queen
And all he saw was a woman
And all she was, was a dream...
Oh oh...And all he saw was a woman, and all she was
Was a dream...
He took her and bound her with ropes tied around her
To his castle he did ride;
In the wood was a bower where stood an old tower
And he threw her deep inside;
Then the birds left the sky and a terrible cry
Brought thunder and lightning, rain falling down
Tears on the ground...
All through the days on her face he would gaze
For she was lovely as the spring;
No words would she speak but "Leave them in peace"
And some sad ballad she would sing
Oh one day by the door, through the window he saw
A single white feather lying on the floor
She was there no more...
Now that great lord is dying
His cold heart is crying for the love of the girl;
For many an hour he has wept on the Tower
For she meant more than the world;
And once in the sky, a white bird flew by
He lifted his hands, and he cried out in pain
"Come back again..."
But his words were lost in the wind
His castle was built upon sand
All he has is the memory
And all he yearns is her hand...
Ah ah..All he has is this memory
And all he yearns is her handEmbed
