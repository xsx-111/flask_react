Old Friend LyricsOld friend, so you're in trouble again, you ask me today
To try and find a little time, and maybe buy a glass of wine
Old friend, I'm coming through...
Old friend, Yes I remember you, always a smile on your face
Oh memory from years before, an old man and a little boy
Old friend, I remember you...
You used to take me fishing down by the wishing well
One day you threw a wish in, and we listened while it fell
And you made a wish...
"When the years are heavy, and my heart is growing cold
Well I wish when the evening comes that there'll always
Be...Some old friend who'll miss me too..."
Well I do, so old friend I'm coming through...
Yes, for you I'll always find the time, we will have a bottle
Of wine, old friend, I'm here by your side, Oh, to the very end
Old friend...I miss you too...My dear old friend...
Old friend...Old friend...Embed
