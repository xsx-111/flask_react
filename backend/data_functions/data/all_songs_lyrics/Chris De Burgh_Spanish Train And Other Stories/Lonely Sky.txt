Lonely Sky LyricsThe cold north wind they call " la bise "
Is swirling round about my knees 
Trees are crying leaves into the river ;
I'm huddled in this french caf'e 
I never thought i'd see the day 
But winter is here and summer's really over 
Even the birds have packed up and gone 
They're flying south with their song 
And my love , she too has gone , she had to fly 
Take care , it's such a lonely sky 
They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight 
They'll build a cage and steal your only sky 
Fly away , fly to me , fly when the wind is high 
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky ...
The old cathedral lights are low 
She and i we'd often go there 
To admire and sometimes kneel in prayer ;
Lords and ladies lie in stone 
Hand in hand from long ago 
And though their hands are cold they'll love forever 
Even the choir rehearses those songs 
For christmas is not long 
And alone , i sing my song , she had to fly 
Out there it's such a lonely sky 
They'll trap your wings my love and hold your flight 
They'll build a cage and steal your only sky 
Fly away , fly to me , fly when the wind is high 
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky 
Fly away , fly to me , and if you need my love 
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky ...
I'll come in with the dawn 
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky 
On the wings of the morn 
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky 
Above the world we'll be flying 
I'm sailing beside you in your lonely sky ...Embed
