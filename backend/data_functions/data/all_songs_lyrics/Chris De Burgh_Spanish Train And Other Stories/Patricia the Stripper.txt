Patricia the Stripper Lyrics
Dennis is a menace
With his "Anyone for tennis?"
And he'd beseech me to come keep the score
And Maude said, "Oh Lord, I'm so terribly bored
I really can't stand it anymore...
I'm going, out to dinner
With a gorgeous singer
To a little place I found down by the quay
Her name is Patricia
She calls herself 'delicia'
And the reason isn't very hard to see
She said, God made her a sinner just to keep fat men thinner
As they tumble down in heaps before her feet
They hang around in groups, like battle weary troops
One can often see them queue right down the street
You see, Patricia, or Delicia
Not only is a singer
She also removes all her clothing
For Patricia
Is the best stripper in town"
And with a swing of her hips
She started to strip
To tremendous applause
She took off her drawers
And with a lick of her lips
She undid all her clips
And threw it all in the air
And everybody stared
And as the last piece of clothing
Fell to the floor
The police were banging on the door
On a Saturday night in 1924
Take it away boys...
(Musical Interlude)

Well, poor Patricia was arrested
And everyone detested
The terrible manner in which she was exposed
Later on in court, where everyone thought
A summer's run in jail would be proposed
But the judge said, "Patricia, or may I say Delicia
The facts of this case lie before me"
(bang bang bang)
"Case dismissed!"
This girl was in her working clothes

And with a swing of her hips
She started to strip
To tremendous applause
She took off her drawers
And with a lick of her lips
She undid all her clips
Threw it all in the air
And everybody stared
And as the last piece of clothing
Fell to the floor
The police were yelling out for more
On a Saturday night in 1924 (x2)1Embed
