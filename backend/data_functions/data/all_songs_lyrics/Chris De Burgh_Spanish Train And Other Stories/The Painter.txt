The Painter LyricsI'd like you to meet my last queen
Over there large as life
She's been hanging there for almost a week
My poor late wife
What do think of the colour of her skin?
It has the bloom of the rose
You see she begged me to bring a certain painter in
And for that picture in her bedroom she would pose
Well after a while he was driving me mad
As you could well understand
Sitting in there, day after day
With my wife in the palm of his hand
It was -
"Madam please do this and Madam please do that"
You've never heard such display
But he didn't mind he was taking his time
It was me that had to pay
"Madam I think we should take a walk in the woods
You understand it's the light"
And did I mind, no, I was so kind when they
Came back in the middle of the night
And I swear I'll take care of the painter
Oh the painter
Well as you can see it was hard for me
But something has to be done
She only has eyes for him and his lies, and as for me
Not a glance, not a single one;
My orders were severe and she disappeared
It really was such a shame
And when they told me she was dead I broke down and said
"It's that painter, it's him, he's to blame."
With his "Madam please do this and Madam please do that"
You've never heard such display
But he didn't mind he was taking his time
It was me that had to pay
"Oh Madam I think we should take a walk in the woods
You understand it's the light"
And did I mind, no, I was so kind when they
Came back in the middle of the night
And I hope it's the rope for the painter
When he's found, it's hellbound for the painter
I'll get that painterEmbed
