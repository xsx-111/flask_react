This Song For You LyricsHello darling, this is the army
I've just got the time to write
Today we attach, there's no turning back
The boys they're all ready for the fight
Yes, I'm well but this place is like hell
They call it Passchendaele
In nineteen seventeen the war must be ending
The General said this attach will not fail;
So I'm writing down this little melody
When you play it my love, think of me...
We'll be together in this song for you
And it goes Lalala...sing it darling...Lalala...
They got old Bill and the Sergeant is still out there
Wounded in some shellhole
They say this war will end all wars
Oh God I really hope it will
Oh how's old England, are they still singing
Those songs that we loved to sing
When all this is over, we'll go sailing in Dover
Catching fish like we used to with a string
Oh I miss you, I miss you, I miss you so
If they get me my love you will know...
We'll always be together in this song for you...
And it goes Lalala...I have to go now...
Take care of yourself my loveEmbed
