A Spaceman Came Travelling Lyrics
A spaceman came travelling on his ship from afar
'Twas light years of time since his mission did start
And over a village he halted his craft
And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star
He followed a light and came down to a shed
Where a mother and child were lying there on a bed
A bright light of silver shone round his head
And he had the face of an angel, and they were afraid
Then the stranger spoke, he said "Do not fear
I come from a planet a long way from here
And I bring a message for mankind to hear,"
And suddenly the sweetest music filled the air

And it went
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
Peace and goodwill to all men, and love for the child
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
This lovely music went trembling through the ground
And many were wakened on hearing that sound
And travellers on the road, the village they found
By the light of that ship in the sky, which shone all round
And just before dawn at the paling of the sky
The stranger returned and said "Now I must fly
When two thousand years of your time has gone by
This song will begin once again, to a baby's cry"

And it was
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
Peace and goodwill to all men, and love for the child
Oh the whole world is waiting
La la la la la la la la la la la
Waiting to hear the song again
La la la la la la la la
There are thousands standing on the edge of the world (La la la la la la la la)
And a star is moving somewhere1Embed
