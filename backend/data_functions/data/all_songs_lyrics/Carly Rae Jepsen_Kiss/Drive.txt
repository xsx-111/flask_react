Drive Lyrics
I had a bad dream, you were there
Like you always are
I had a bad day, I don't care
When I'm in your car

So drive so fast, baby, through the night
Drive so fast, and they're never gonna find you
Drive so fast, saying no goodbyes
Drive so fast, and we'll leave it all behind you

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

You're laughing at me in your head
With my teasing games
Let's talk about you, you're in love
Wanna change my name

So drive so fast, baby, through the night
Drive so fast, and they're never gonna find you
Drive so fast, saying no goodbyes
Drive so fast, and we'll leave it all behind you
Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love
Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

Boy, I get a kick out of you
You know I'm yours
The things you're making me do
I never thought you'd hit me to the core
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love

Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love
Ooh, I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, loveEmbed
