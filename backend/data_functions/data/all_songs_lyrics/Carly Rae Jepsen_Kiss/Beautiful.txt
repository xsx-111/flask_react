Beautiful Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Hello, I know it's been a while
I wonder where you are
And if you think of me sometimes
Cause you're always on my mind
You know I had it rough trying to forget you
But the more that I look around, the more I realize
You're all I'm looking for

What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me (To me)
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, yeah

Just friends, the beginning or the end
How do we make sense, when we're on our own?
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete, yeah, should have known
Nothing in the world compares to the feelings that we share
So not fair
What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me (To me)
You try to take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now, oh

It's not you, blame it all on me, I was running from myself
'Cause I couldn't tell how deep that we, we were gonna be
I was scared, it's destiny, but it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late, just a twist of fate, yeah

What makes you so beautiful
Is you don't know how beautiful you are, to me
You're not tryna be perfect
Nobody's perfect, but you are, to me (To me)
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say

I wish somehow I could say them now
Oh, I could say them now, mmm4Embed
