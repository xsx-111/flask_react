Sweetie Lyrics
We were both headed different ways
Both in a rush trying to get away
I ran into you, ooh-ooh
Like a crash of thunder
Out in the rain, waiting for the bus
We started talking 'bout different stuff
And it's true, ooh-ooh
There's an eighth world wonder
And from now on

You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want, boy, I can make it happen
We can fall in love, and I could be your sweetie
Any time of day, boy, I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie, yeah
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want, boy, I can make it happen
We can fall in love, and I could be your sweetie, sweetie, yeah
A dinner date, and a glass of wine
We stayed up late and lost track of time
When I'm with you, ooh-ooh
I feel a different hunger
You held my hand and you didn't let go
I'm gonna kiss you now
I thought you should know
And it's true, ooh-ooh
There's an eighth world wonder
And from now on

You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you

Anything you want, boy, I can make it happen
We can fall in love, and I could be your sweetie
Any time of day, boy, I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie, yeah
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want, boy, I can make it happen
We can fall in love, and I could be your sweetie, sweetie, yeah
Anything you want, boy
Anything you need
Anything you want, boy
Anything you need

Anything you want, boy, I can make it happen
We can fall in love, and I could be your sweetie
Any time of day, boy, I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie, yeah
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
Anything you want, boy, I can make it happen
We can fall in love, and I could be your sweetie
Any time of day, boy, I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie, yeah
You're not as lonely as you think you are (As lonely)
I'm trying to tell you
That all I want to do is just be here with you
And give you satisfaction, in saying sweetie, yeahEmbed
