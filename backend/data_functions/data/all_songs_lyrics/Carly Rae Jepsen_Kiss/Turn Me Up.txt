Turn Me Up Lyrics
All alone
Here I am
I don't know what I'm after (Oh-oh-oh)
Now that you're just a friend
I can't call you and ask you (Oh-oh-oh)

And from the very first time I saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You were talkin' so sweet, I had to taste
I wish I never tried

I'm breaking up with you, you're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
'Cause breakin' us in two is breakin' me in pieces
Breakin' up with you, you're breakin' up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
I'm givin' up and goin' out tonight
Turn me up (Turn me up), turn me on (Turn me on)
Turn me up (Turn me up), and turn me on (Turn me on, me on)
And tonight, here you are
And I know what you're after (Oh-oh-oh)
But you're reading me wrong
'Cause I'm closing this chapter (Oh-oh-oh)

And from the very first time I saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You were talking so sweet, I had to taste
I wish I never tried

I'm breaking up with you, you're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
'Cause breakin' us in two is breakin' me in pieces
Breakin' up with you, you're breakin' up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
I'm givin' up and goin' out tonight
Turn me up (Turn me up), turn me on (Turn me on)
Turn me up (Turn me up), and turn me on (Turn me on, me on)
Turn me up, turn me on
T-t-t-turn me up, and turn me on
And on

Breaking up with you, you're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
I'm givin' up and goin' out tonight
Turn me up (Turn me up), turn me on (Why don't you turn me on?)
Turn me up (Why don't you turn me on?)
Turn me on (On, and on, and on)
Turn me up (Why don't you turn me up?)
Turn me on (Turn me on, turn me on)
Turn me up (Turn me up), turn me on1Embed
