Wrong Feels So Right Lyrics
You got your way with me now, didn't you?
And I don't know why
Things you do are things we've done before
Don't you be looking at me darling, with your sneaky eyes
Now what could you be looking at me for?

Sometimes when I'm lonely, I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep, I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind

Oh, I think this could be the one night
I give into this fight
Boy, I just might, 'cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion
Hold me, be the way you told me
Whisper something so sweet
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right (So right, so right)

It's breaking my heart to see you, lover, and I don't know why
Things you say are things you've said before
Instead of the truth, I swear you'd stick a needle in your eye
Now what can you be looking at me for?
Sometimes when I'm lonely, I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep, I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind

Oh, I think this could be the one night
I give into this fight
Boy, I just might, 'cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion
Hold me, be the way you told me
Whisper something so sweet
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right

Tell me, what was I supposed to do with that type of attention?
I gave all that I had to you
You forget to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention, but not your intention, no no
Tell me, what was I supposed to do with that type of attention?
I gave all that I had to you
You forget to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention, but not your intention, no no
I think this could be the one night
I give into this fight
Boy, I just might, 'cause you rule my head
I can't stop the motion

I can't stop the motion, I can't stop the motion
Stop the motion, stop the motion
Wrong feels so right
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right
This could be the night
Wrong feels so rightEmbed
