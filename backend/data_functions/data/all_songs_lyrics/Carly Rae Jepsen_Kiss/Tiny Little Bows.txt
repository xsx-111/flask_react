Tiny Little Bows Lyrics
Cupid, draw back your bow

New York, tell me how you feel about it
We just met, yeah, we just met
LA, ask me for the truth about it
We just met, and I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands

How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows?
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow
How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows?
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow

Paris, do you ever think about us?
Watching TV in your bed
Hey London, call me if you think about it
Don't forget, I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands
How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows?
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow
How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows?
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow

Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go straight to a lover's heart
For me, for me

How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows?
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high
How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows?
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are is a place I wanna go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow

I wish we could be holding hands
Dancing really high, dancing really slow
Dancing really slow2Embed
