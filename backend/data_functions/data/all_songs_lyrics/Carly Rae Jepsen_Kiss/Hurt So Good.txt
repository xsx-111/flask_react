Hurt So Good Lyrics
When you smile like a tease
Baby, you don't even know (You don't even know)
When my heart skips a beat, darling, every time you go
(Every time you go)

When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move (I can't move)
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a "wish I could" (I could)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good? (Hurt so good)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

All the girls on the block, they come knocking at your door (Knocking at your door)
You just stare out the window, what you waiting for?
(What you waiting for?)

Is it too late or too soon?
I'm right outside here wanting you (Wanting you)
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?
I don't ever wanna let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a "wish I could" (I could)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good? (Hurt so good)

Imagine you, imagine me
Together so happily
Imagine me, imagine you
Inside a dream I built for two

When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move (I can't move)
You don't see me, but you should
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?

I don't ever want to let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow (Slow)
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a "wish I could" (Wish I could)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good? (So good)
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?2Embed
