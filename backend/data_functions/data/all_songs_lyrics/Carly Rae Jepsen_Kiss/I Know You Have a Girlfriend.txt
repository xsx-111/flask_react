I Know You Have a Girlfriend Lyrics
Baby, I don't need to look far
Everywhere I turn, there, there you are
Somebody should sound the alarm
'Cause when you try to get me alone, you

Talk to me in riddles
You treat me like a crime

I know you have a girlfriend (So don't kiss me on the lips)
I know you have a girlfriend (Oh, don't you tell me what I did)
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
You're lying through your te-te-te-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend (And I hear she's kinda nice)
I know you have a girlfriend (So don't give me those eyes)
I know you have a girlfriend (Oh, won't you let me be?)
I'm begging you, stop begging me
(I'm begging you, stop begging me)

Tiptoeing around all the facts
Tease me 'til I laugh and I relax
I know there's a reason for that
'Cause you've been trying to get me alone
And talk to me in riddles
You cover me in rhymes

I know you have a girlfriend (So don't kiss me on the lips)
I know you have a girlfriend (Oh, don't you tell me what I did)
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
You're lying through your te-te-te-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend (And I hear she's kinda nice)
I know you have a girlfriend (So don't give me those eyes)
I know you have a girlfriend (Oh, won't you let me be?)
I'm begging you, stop begging me
(I'm begging you, stop begging me)

You're sick with dreams about it
Didn't I, didn't I blush?
I think, I think, I think I want it way too much

I know you have a girlfriend (And it cuts me like a knife)
I know you have a girlfriend (Is she gonna be your wife?)
I know you have a girlfriend
And every time you speak
You're lying through your te-te-teeth
I know you have a girlfriend (Tell me, where is she tonight?)
I know you have a girlfriend ('Cause I heard you had a fight)
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh, won't you let me be?
I'm begging you, stop begging me
I know you have (I'm begging you, stop begging me)
I know you have
I know you have a girlfriend1Embed
