More Than a Memory Lyrics
Speak to me (To me)
You're walking closer and it's hard to breathe (To breathe)
I should be running, but the heart's naive
And I expect too much (Too much, too much, too much)
You were good to me (To me)
I left a scar that no one else can see (Can see)
And now you're back here
And reminding me that I lost way too much
(Too much, too much, too much)

Do you know that night I almost said I loved you
(Loved you, loved you, loved you)
And you almost said it back?

Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny?
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
(Memory, memory, memory)

Say my name (My name)
'Cause no one else can say it quite the same (The same)
It takes me back to your September days
I've missed you way too much (Too much, too much, too much)
If I was cruel to you
Well, just to hear it, breaks my heart in two (In two)
If there's a way to make it up to you
I wanna change so much, you know I do

And know that night I almost said I loved you
(Loved you, loved you, loved you)
And you almost said it back?

Are we gonna be more than a memory?
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny?
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Stay with me
I really need to hear you breathe
If words can't speak, lay your body next to me

Are we gonna be more than a memory? (More than a memory)
No matter how lame my apology (Lame my apology)
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
Are you gonna just stand in front of me (Stand in front of me)
Pretending I'm not your destiny? (Not your destiny)
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?

More than a memory
Lame my apology
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?2Embed
