Melt with You Lyrics
If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good (To good)
Tell the world to wait outside (Outside)
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you
(If I could melt with you)

I've been thinking about it
I know something's wrong
Fading out in the distance (Distance)
We've been lost in the songs
Let's turn the clocks to somewhere we won't ever stop
Don't ever leave

If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good (To good)
Tell the world to wait outside (Outside)
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you
Hearing echoes and voices (Voices)
All I couldn't see (See)
We have all kinds of choices (Choices)
If it was uá¹— to me
I'd turn the clocks to somewhere we won't ever stop
Don't ever leave

If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good (To good)
Tell the world to wait outside (Outside)
Just you and I
And if I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you

And every time that passes by, I see you
I see you
Ever now and then, I like to pretend

If I could melt with you, I would
I'd find our way back to good (To good)
Tell the world to wait outside (Outside)
I could hold on to your edge
And fall to your deepest ends
We would come true, if I could melt with you
If I melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with you (With you, with you)
If I melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with youEmbed
