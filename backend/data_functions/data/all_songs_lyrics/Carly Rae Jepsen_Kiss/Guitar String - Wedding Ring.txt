Guitar String / Wedding Ring Lyrics
You were here, and then you left
Now there's nobody, nobody
Now they're all just second best
There's nobody, nobody

So if you want me, I'll be around
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Just hold me closer
Oh, won't you hold me down tonight?

But if you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it, this is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings

And when you're near, I feel the best
I'm somebody, somebody
It's in my pulse, it's in my chest
My whole body, whole body
So if you want me, I'll be around
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
Just hold me closer
Oh, won't you hold me down tonight?

But if you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it, this is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings

You're in the country and I'm in the town
You're a bird in the water, I'm a fish on the ground
And I want to be there for you tonight
And I hope you hear me
Baby, hold on tight
Hold on tight, yeah

If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it, this is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger, you know what I mean?
You play my heart strings1Embed
