Take No Prisoners Lyrics
Got one chance, (infiltrate them)
Get it right, (terminate them)
The Panzers will (permeate them)
Break their pride (denigrate them)
And their people (retrograde them)
Typhus, (deteriate them)
Epidemic, (devastate them)
Take no prisoners, (cremate them)
Burn!

Going to war, give’em hell
D-Day, next stop Normandy
Beginning of the end
We know how to and sure as shit we'll win
“War is peace”, sure man
A retreat for the damned
A playground for the demented
A haven for those who walk this world bereft of heart and soul

Love and war, they say all is fair
Take his life, but won't take his hair
Your body parts your country spares
By the way son, here's your wheelchair
He once had to be all he could be
Now he's nothing for no one, nowhere to see
Funny thing, he's like you and me
It's a funny thing, funny thing
Tears streak his solemn stare
Abandoned for wreckage, nobody cares
No one knew what would happen there
No one spoke, no one even dared
Don't ask what you can do for your country
Ask what your country can do for you
Take no prisoners, (take no shit)
Take no prisoners, (take no shit)
Take no prisoners, (take no shit)
Take no prisoners, take no... shit!8Embed
