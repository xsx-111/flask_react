The Enemy Lyrics
Staring at the picture of someone I know I love
We had to part, now you're gone
Cannot sleep at night I toss and turn for the world to see
We're killing time with myself

But you are always there to remind me
Your fate's if you're never around me
You are always there to remind me
You make me feel like I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy

Wishing for the days that we first met and we moved out
To places where we could die
To places where we could die

But you are always there to remind me
Your fate's if you're never around me
You are always there to remind me
You make me feel like I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemy
I'm the enemy, I'm the enemyEmbed
