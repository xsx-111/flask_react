Observations LyricsTo live like common people I never think I’ll do
And so my love I give in to this dark
Flowers in the daytime and Lucifer at night
This woman said I’m torn between two lives
Visions of young lovers holding hands in joyful rides
Wishing they would never be apart
And so again I hold on to someone I can’t have
Obsessed with all the things that we could do
Take me on a night drive and take me home again
A quiet trip where we will meet the end
To live like common people I never think I’ll do
In defiance of a love not realized1Embed
