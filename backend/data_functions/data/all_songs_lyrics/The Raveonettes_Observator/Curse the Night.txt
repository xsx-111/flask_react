Curse the Night LyricsCurse the night
It's you and I in the end tonight
Oh dear, oh dear
Curse the night
It's you and I in the end tonight
Oh dear, oh dear
I think I lied, cause you only...
I travelled all night just to be with you
Curse the night
It's you and I in the end tonight
Oh dear, oh dear
Curse the night
It's you and I in the end tonight
Oh dear, oh dear
I cry back, I feel the streets say
I'm holding on, someone else escaped
Curse the night
It's you and I in the end tonight
Oh dear, oh dear
Curse the night
It's you and I in the end tonight
Oh dear, oh dear
I cry my day, I travel your sea
I want you, you didn't want me
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uhEmbed
