She Owns The Streets LyricsI wanna know her
I wanna ask her
I wanna know where she did go wrong
Is it valium, is it all drugs?
Or is it just every day fun?
She’s dancing in the street
Yeah, she’s dancing in the street
Dancing in the street
Yeah she’s dancing, dancing, dancing in the street
See your cool now
It’s a gas now
Watch her dance among the Bowery caps
People feel her
They’re so boring
They call the cabs and they want who is fun
She’s dancing in the street
Yeah, she’s dancing in the street
Dancing in the street
Yeah she’s dancing, dancing, dancing in the street
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the street
I can’t wait to get to know you
I wanna be the one that gives you the ride
If they catch you and connect you
They’ll never know what this life is about
She’s dancing in the street
Yeah, she’s dancing in the street
Dancing in the street
Yeah she’s dancing, dancing, dancing in the street
Dancing, dancing, dancing in the street
She Owns, She Owns, She Owns the streets
She Owns, She Owns, She Owns the streets
She Owns, She Owns, She Owns the streets
She Owns, She Owns, She Owns the streets
She Owns, She Owns, She Owns the streets
She Owns, She Owns, She Owns the streetsEmbed
