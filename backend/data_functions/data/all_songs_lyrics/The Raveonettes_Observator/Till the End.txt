Till the End LyricsCalm down, please stay
Walk upon the ocean till the end
Slow down, don't move
For a moment I belong to you
It's never quite the same
And the one I love never came
And all the songs I've made
Dripping all in my love
Calm down, be still
When you walk upon the ocean till the end
Slow down, don't move
For a moment I belong to you
I'm on the verge of sleep
In the dark, so bored
So I shake until
Let it all begin again
Calm down, be still
When you walk upon the ocean till the end
Slow down, don't move
For a moment I belong to you
Calm down, be still
When you walk upon the ocean till the end
Slow down, don't move
For a moment I belong to youEmbed
