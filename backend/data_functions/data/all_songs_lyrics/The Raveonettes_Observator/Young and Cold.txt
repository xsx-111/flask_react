Young and Cold LyricsI saw it, you and me and time apart
I get a shiver from broken hearts
I like the sun when it don't shine
I make it hard on anyone
So many restless souls
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold
In the roaring springtime dust
I love you way too much
So I wonder where to go
When love moves way too slow
So many hearts they will explode
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold
All this is talk is a waste of time
'cause in dreams you're always mine
Why do it burn with such delight?
A leap of joy will make it right
So many times I've lost control
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold
I saw it, you and me and time apart
I get a shiver from broken hearts
I like the sun when it don't shine
I make it hard on anyone
So many restless souls
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and cold
So many restless souls
I don't wanna be young and cold
I don't wanna be young and coldEmbed
