Paradise Lyrics
If we left this town
We could walk the Earth together
If you let me down
I will live in you forever

(Sha la la la la, sha la la la la)
I want you, I want you
(Not in love with you, not in love with you)
I need you, I need you
(Sha la la la la, sha la la la la)
I want you, I want you
(La la la la la la la)
I need you, I need you

If we could find a home
We could go through time together
If we could hold our own
Devastate the night forever

There's no place where we can't go
There's no place where I have been
There's no limit I can show
There's no level inbetween
Jolene, I could have seen you there
Jolene, I need you everywhere

(Sha la la la la, sha la la la la)
I want you, I want you
(La la la la la, la la la la la)
I need you, I need you
(Sha la la la la, sha la la la la)
I want you, I want you
(La la la la la, la la la la la)
I need you, I need you

Jolene
I could have seen you there
When I looked into your lifeless eyes
I saw you everywhere

There's no place where you can hide
There's no place that I can't find
There's no end to leave me clean
There's no reason I have seen
If you find me on my own
You could live your life forever
Shall we leave our world alone
Maybe we'll go back or never
