Blues Hour LyricsMy ghost is
Always hungry
My soul is over apart
Train lines
Going nowhere
No destination found
Is this a final home?
Compensation
Delivery undone
And thanks for all this
Trying to listen
Remembering a kill
Train lines
Going nowhere
No destination found
We'll leave this world
Just as we found it
We'll leave this place alone
Star aligns
On a hill slide
Everyone alone
Train lines
Going nowhere
No destination foundEmbed
