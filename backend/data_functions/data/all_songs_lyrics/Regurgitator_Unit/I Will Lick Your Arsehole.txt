I Will Lick Your Arsehole LyricsI'm like Mister Clifford Richard I'm wired for sound
When I get myself a mic you don't wanna be around
I'm off like the note on care in Karen's 'Day Tripper'
I'm faking all my lines like that dolphin called Flipper
Send chills down your spine like the strings in 'Billie Jean'
I'm so far underground that I'm a one person scene
I'm overly thorough, just like David Attenborough
When he's whispering in the jungle like they're working undercover
Evidence irrefutable, I'm squarer than a cubicle
I hug the straight and narrow like a Julie Andrews musical
I derail and flail with abstract verse I fail to curtail
The rhythmical measures and pleasurable endeavours never sail
I'm lacking in ambition, simply no predisposition
And when I hit the stage, I lose all composition
I never like it loud, 'cause crowded places scare me
I dig the rock 'n' roll as much as Peter Paul & Mary
Asshole, I will lick your
Asshole, I will lick your
Asshole, I will lick your

I'm the host with the most uber Guy Smiley
I've got the special effects like the BBC man
I've got flow like  Malmsteem's got chops
It seems that i'm so bad they get LL to call the cops
Beats so hard they'll be bustin up your spleen
I got more rhymes than Derm's hair got sheen
I put flash in the dance just like Irene Cara
And i've got more toys than Teruhisa Kitahara
Like a digital refinery i hope you 'lise the binary
So zeros after ones getting lined up into finery
I put them into rows to get the music go
And they goes and they flows like the mucus out your nose
Asisiatic Australasiatic
Instamatic rhythm box static addict
I got the juice and all else got the pith
And i'm tough under pressure just like Sarah Jane Smith
Arsehole
I will lick your arsehole
I will lick your arsehole
I will lick your arsehole
I will lick your arsehole
I will lick your arsehole
I will lick your arsehole
I will lick your
