Polyester Girl Lyrics
All I want you to say is nothing at all
And all I want you to do is stare at the wall
I love your plastic hair and plastic eyes
Marvel at your plastic breasts and plastic thighs

My polyester girl
So shiny
Polyester girl
So shiny
Polyester girl
So shiny
Polyester girl
So shiny

You're this perfect guy's accessory (Doo-wee-doo-wee-doo)
Dangling from my arm for all of the pretty people to see
Poised with sassy pout and perky cleave (Doo-wee-doo-wee-doo)
Great for backstage and entertainment award ceremonies

My polyester girl
So shiny
Polyester girl
So shiny
Polyester girl
So shiny
Polyester girl
So shiny
Took you for a ride up in an aeroplane
But your body burst and left an ugly stain
Had to take your pieces back to the factory
It took them several weeks to get you back to me

My polyester girl 
So shiny
Polyester girl 
So shiny
Polyester girl 
So shiny
Polyester girl 
So shiny
Polyester girl  (She's my polyester girl)
So shiny
Polyester girl  (Shiniest in all the world)
So shiny
Polyester girl  (She's my polyester girl)
So shiny
Polyester girl  (Shiniest in all the world)
So shiny
Polyester girl  (My polyester girl)
So shiny
Polyester girl  (Shiniest in all the world)
So shiny
Polyester girl  (My polyester girl)
So shiny
Polyester girl  (Shiniest in all the world)
