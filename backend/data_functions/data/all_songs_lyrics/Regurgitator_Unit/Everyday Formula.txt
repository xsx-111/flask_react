Everyday Formula Lyrics
Everyday I shit into the sea
It's strange but it doesn't mean much to me
I'm living in a porcelain dream
And things ain't quite what they seem

I try to keep things so nice
Each surface glowing snow white
It's good to be alive in here

Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it...

Everyday I talk to my machines
More sense than talking to human beings
It's pretty in the land of the free
Where things ain't quite what they seem

My whole world's cheap and phony
Dear hearts get lost and lonely
I'll get what's coming to me soon
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be al-

Doot doot doot doot doot doot doo-doot
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doo-doot

Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doo-doot
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doo-doot
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be alright
Ooh, it's gonna be all shiteEmbed
