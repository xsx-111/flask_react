The World of Sleaze LyricsThe world of sleaze
Welcome to the world of sleaze
Pretty baby, we've got everything you need
You'll fit in it's such a breeze, pretty baby
Happy living on your knees
Cos there's dicks and cunts
And slut and butts, oh
Pimps and hoes, yeah
Plenty of those
There's no end to the things you can win
And i'll be your friend if you just spread your legs
Don't be afraid
Everything's great
You'll be okay if you just take my hand
Welcome to the world of sleaze
Baby may i help you sir we aim to please
Walking through the world of sleaze
Pretty baby we've got everything you need
We've got dicks and cunts
And slut and butts, oh
Pimps and hoes, yeah
Plenty of those
There's no end to the things you can win
And i'll be your friend if you just spread your legs
Dicks and cunts and sluts and butts oh
Pimps and hoes yeah plenty of those
Flesh in the rare with the vacant stares
And rich fanfares spurting joy through the air
Don't be afraid
Everything's great
You'll be okay if you just take my hand
Ugh hoh, yeah (x3)Embed
