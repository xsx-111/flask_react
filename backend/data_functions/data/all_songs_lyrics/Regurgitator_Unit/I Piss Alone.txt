I Piss Alone LyricsI piss alone, ugh hoh
I don't want nobody to know
That I haven't got the pressure of some of the other boys
They make a noise, it scares me so
I piss alone, alone
I don't want nobody to know
That I don't have the pressure of some of the other boys
Leave me alone, alone
I just wanna be on my own
'Cause I haven't got the pressure of some of the other boys
I want a world where pissing troughs are obselete
There's only rows and rows of cubicles
I'm so afraid
When I try it is often delayed
I stand and stare into the air
And then I might just put it away
So quiet in here
The only sound around is the fear
The other guy is pounding the wall
Like he's shooting deer
I need a place where I can close and lock the door
Then I can stop and let it flowEmbed
