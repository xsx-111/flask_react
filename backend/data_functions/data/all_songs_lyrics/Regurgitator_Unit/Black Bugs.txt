Black Bugs Lyrics
I got killed by black bugs on my video game
Then I go to myself "it doesn't mean too much"
I keep dying and dying over and over again
But I feel I'm alive, so I'll just pretend

What's at the end
What's at the end
What's at the end of Satan's rainbow?
What's at the end
What's at the end
What's at the end of Satan's rainbow?

Stared at the TV too long now and I'm not the same
I got too remind my self, that it's just a game
It's getting harder and harder to get to sleep at night
I think I'll let them shoot me, so that I can die

What's at the end
What's at the end
What's at the end of Satan's rainbow?
What's at the end
What's at the end
What's at the end of Satan's rainbow?

What's at the end
What's at the end
What's at the end of Satan's rainbow?
What's at the end
What's at the end
What's at the end of Satan's rainbow?
What's at the end
Tell me is this the end?
What's at the end of Satan's rainbow?
What's at the end
What's at the end
What's at the end of Satan's rainbow?

What's at the end x5Embed
