Just Another Beautiful Story Lyrics
All that I am and all I'll ever be
Is a brain in a body
And all that I know and all I'll ever see
Is the real things around me

All I've heard and it's true
There ain't no God there's just me and you
I don't see a point to this place
But I'm happy to be floating in space...

I won't mind if you're holding my hand
Life seems so fine when you don't understand it
The world turns around and it don't give a damn
If we all die away and we never come back again

All that I am and all that I'll ever be
Is a brain in a body
I live til I die and then run away
It's a beautiful story

All I've heard and it's true
There ain't no God there's just me and you
I don't see a point to this place
I'm happy to be floating in outer-space...
