I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff Lyrics
I see your band now and it's not too bad
You're nothing like you used to be
Please write some songs that really do not suck
Please become what you were before

I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff

I try hard not to bring up the past
I'm sorry i had to again
You don't know me i feel you are my friend
I'm trying not to be pretend

I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff

I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuff
I like your old stuff better than your new stuffEmbed
