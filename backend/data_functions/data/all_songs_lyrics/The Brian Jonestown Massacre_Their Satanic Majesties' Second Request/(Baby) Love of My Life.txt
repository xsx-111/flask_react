(Baby) Love of My Life LyricsShe said, I love you
And I know it can't be wrong
Cause I've waited for so long
I've waited for you
He said, oh
Girl you best run for your life
Cause I'll never take a wife
I live alone with all my strife
I'm unrepented
And I said
I love her
All the tears that she has cried
Many years after they've dried
I will be there by her side
Cause I love herEmbed
