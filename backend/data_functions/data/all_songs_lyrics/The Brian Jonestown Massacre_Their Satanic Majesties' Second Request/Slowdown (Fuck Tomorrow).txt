Slowdown (Fuck Tomorrow) LyricsI know
If I kissed you
Tomorrow
Surely miss you
I don't ?
Can't say
That I want you
Inside you soul
That wants you
You've got my love
To feel
?
To a place ?
?
It's okay 'cause we're getting ?
Just like love
?
Everyone is so happy
I'll show you
How I love you
Below you
And above you
I believe ?
Slow down
Fuck tomorrow
? sorrow
I've got ?
In here
?
To a place that's ?
? to say
It's okay, cause we're getting ?
Just like love
There's a look in your eye
It's a pleasure ?
Just like you
Everyone is so happy, yeah
YeahEmbed
