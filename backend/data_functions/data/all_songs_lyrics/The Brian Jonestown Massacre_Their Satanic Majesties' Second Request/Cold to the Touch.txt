Cold to the Touch LyricsI wanna see your face, girl
I wanna touch your skin
I've been out of place now
I don't care where you've been
Let's go again
I wanna see your face, girl
Right when I'm stepping in
Sliding around your place, yeah
Baby, your Devil's grin
I wanna feel you
When you got really well
(?) sin
I wanna feel your kiss
Right underneath my chin
Maybe (?)
But come on let's go again
I wanna feel you
(?) real, yeah
(?)
I wanna feel you
I wanna see it
(?) your skin
I would've told you
(?) I hold you
(?)
Here we go againEmbed
