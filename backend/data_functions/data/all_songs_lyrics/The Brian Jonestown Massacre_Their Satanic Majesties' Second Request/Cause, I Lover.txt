Cause, I Lover LyricsShe said I love you
And I know it can't be wrong
'Cause I've waited for so long
I've waited for you
He said Ah
Girl, you best run for your life
Because I'll never take a wife
I live alone with all my strife
I'm unrepentant
But I said I love her
All the tears that she has cried
Many years after they've dried
I will be there by her side
Because I love her
Yes I do...YouEmbed
