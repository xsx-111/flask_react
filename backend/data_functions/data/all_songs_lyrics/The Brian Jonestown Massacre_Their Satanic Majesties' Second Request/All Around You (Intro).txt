All Around You (Intro) LyricsAll around you everywhere
It surrounds you the love we share
It's a secret for everyone
If you listen we'll give you some
All you wanted, what you need
Will be given without greed
The begaining and the end
Altogether with our freinds
All around you everywhere
It surrounds you the love we share
It's a secret in your ear
If you listen, if you will hearEmbed
