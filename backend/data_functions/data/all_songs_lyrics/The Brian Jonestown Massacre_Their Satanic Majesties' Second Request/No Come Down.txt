No Come Down LyricsI'm waiting for the come down
To put me in my place
I'm giving you the low down
So you don't make my mistakes
I've tried to take it easy
I did the best I could
I'm waiting here for Jesus
Cause it makes me feel so good
I'm living like a Devil
Although I am a Saint
They promise me salvation
But I don't have time to wait
If there's a God in Heaven
Then tell him where i am
Tell him i'm real busy now
And I'll see him when I can
I'll get there when I can
When I get out of here
I'm going to feel real fine
When I get out of here
I'm going to lose my mind
I'm going to get real high
I'm going to get real low
I'm going to take it fast
And then I take it slow
I'm going to get you there
And then I'll bring you back
I got the Holy Spirit
Breathing down my neck
I'm going to climb the walls
I'm going to swim the moat
I've got God the father
Jumping down my throat
I've got the Virgin Mary
Naked on my bed
And I got sweet Lord Jesus
Living in my head
Oh yeah
I'm lying on the pavement
I got too big a dose
You said you'd treat me right boy
But this don't even come close
If I catch up to you
I'm going to split your skull in two
You best be leaving town now
Cause I'm coming after youEmbed
