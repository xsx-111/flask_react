Anenome Lyrics
I, I think I know how I feel
'Cause I, I only play it for real
You should be picking me up
Instead you're dragging me down
You're flying over my head
You're landing all over town

You, you know that I try
Try to tell you the truth
Oh, baby don't make me cry
You should be picking me up
Instead you're dragging me down
Now I'm missing you more
'Cause baby you're not around
Now that you're not around


I, I want to know how it feels
'Cause I, I only play it for real
You should be picking me up
Instead you're dragging me down
I could be giving you love
But you're not around
Now that you're not around
Now that you're not around
Glad that you're not around
Now that you're not around
Glad that you're not around
Now that you're not around
Glad that you're not around
Now that you're not around
Glad that you're not around
Now that you're not around
Now that you're not around
Now that you're not around3Embed
