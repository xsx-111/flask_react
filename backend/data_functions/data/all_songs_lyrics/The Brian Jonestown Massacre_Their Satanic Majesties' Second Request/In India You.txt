In India You LyricsIf your still not free
Look inside you'll see
If you lie to me
You will never be
Don't you know?
If it's time to grow
Then the seed you'll sow
If you love yourself
So will everyone else
Don't you know?
If try to be
You will never see
Look inside to free
And you soon will be
Don't you know?Embed
