Jesus LyricsI turn to Jesus when I've lost all my friends
And the good times all ended with my money I spent it
I gave you my love but you tore me to pieces
Have mercy please, Jesus
Have mercy please, Jesus
On me
Missed my connection to the second resurrection
On closer inspection
I lost my direction
I gave you true love but you tore me to pieces
Have mercy please, Jesus
I'm begging you, Jesus
For me
I turn to Jesus when I've lost all my friends
And the good times all ended with my money I spent it
I gave you my love but you blew it away
And the look on your face was
The words you can't say cause
I gave you my love but you tore me to pieces
Have mercy please, Jesus
Have mercy please, Jesus
On me
Have mercy please, Jesus
Have mercy sweet Jesus
I'm begging you, Jesus
