Green Thoughts LyricsThese green thoughts
Wondering where you've been
Maybe with my best friend
Dear God please stop me thinking these green thoughts
These green thoughts
Burning across my mind
Wondering what I'll find
Oh God please stop me thinking these green thoughts
Green thoughts come around
Every now and then
When they bring you down
Run away while you still can
These green thoughts
Thinking about you now
And I am wondering how
I get myself involved in these green thoughts
Green thoughts come around
Every now and then
When they bring you down
Run away while you still can
These green thoughts
Wondering what I'll learn
Baby when I return
Can't stop myself from thinking these green thoughts
Thinking these green thoughts
Thinking these green thoughts
These green thoughtsEmbed
