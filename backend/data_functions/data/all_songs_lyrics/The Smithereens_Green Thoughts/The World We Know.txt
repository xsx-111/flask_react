The World We Know LyricsWhen the fire burns out
All that's left is ashes of a broken heart
There's no use my friend
In all your talk, talk, talking, when you're worlds apart
When the fire burns out
All that's left is ashes of a broken heart
And you left me thinking
At last she told you when you broke apart
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
She unties your hand, used to come up empty
In the world we know
When your time is up try to run and hide
But there's no place to go
When the fire burns out
All that's left is ashes of a broken heart
When you pack your bag
And there's nowhere to go to, learn to play the part
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
World that we know
(World that we know)
What went so wrong?
(It went all wrong)
World that we know
(World that we know)
Didn't last long
I told you, when the fire burns out
All that's left is ashes of a broken heart
There's no use my friend
In all your talk, talk, talking, when you're worlds apart
When the fire burns out
All that's left is ashes of a broken heart
And you left me thinking
At last she told you when you broke apart
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we know
Broken heart, time to go, torn apart
World we knowEmbed
