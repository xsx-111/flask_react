Something New LyricsIt is time for something new
For us to do
So darling dry your eyes
It's time for something new
It is time for something new
I still love you
We've tried but it won't work
It's time for something new
Something new is what we need
Something new we have agreed
It is time for us to look for something new
Now it's time for something new
I wonder who
Will hold you in his arms
It's time for something new
Something new
Something new
For something newEmbed
