Especially for You LyricsI've been running round in circles
Trying to find my way back to you
It's been so long since I felt this way
That I forgot what I'm supposed to do
You won't break my heart
No matter what you do
My love is especially for you
I've been trying to build a bridge
To get to you for so many years
Now, it looks like it will have to be a dam
Instead to hold back the tears
You won't make me cry
My heart won't break in two
My love is especially for you
It's the same every night
When I turn off the light
And I'm hugging my pillow
Instead of you
In the morning I rise
And I tell myself lies
And pretend that I'm happy
Inspite of you
It's the same every night
When I turn off the light
And I'm hugging my pillow
Instead of you
In the morning I rise
And I tell myself lies
And pretend that I'm happy
Inspite of you
I've been running round in circles
Trying to find my way back to you
It's been so long since I felt this way
That I forgot what I'm supposed to do
You won't break my heart
No matter what you do
My love is especially for you
My love is especially for you
My love is especially for you
Ah, ah, ahEmbed
