Spellbound LyricsI have lost my memory
Baby for the life of me
Did I meet you in my dreams
On some lonely street it seems
One look and I wear my heart upon my sleeve
One touch from you and I just can't believe
I am spellbound
Spellbound
Leave me spellbound
Spellbound
Once I cried but now I find
I have left those days behind
My mind's racing round and round
I was lost but now I found
One look and I wear my heart upon my sleeve
One touch from you and I just can't believe
I am spellbound
Spellbound
Leave me spellbound
Spellbound
Each time I look in your eyes
I get the same surprise
And since the day that we met
You just won't let me forget
I am spellbound
Spellbound
Leave me spellbound
Spellbound
I have met my destiny
Baby for the life of me
I had seen your face it seems
On some lonely street of dreams
One look at you and the room is spinning round
One touch of you and my feet leave the ground
I am spellbound
Spellbound
Leave me spellbound
