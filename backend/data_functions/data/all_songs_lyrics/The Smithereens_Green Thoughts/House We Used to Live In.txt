House We Used to Live In LyricsThis is the house we used to live in
This is the place I used to know
This is the house we used to live in
Where I felt I could always go
House that we used to live in
House where I left my heart
House that we used to live in falling apart
This is the house we used to live in
This is the place that I once knew
This is the house we used to live in
Where I once shared my life with you
House that we used to live in
House where I left my heart
House that we used to live in falling apart
A house is not a home
And when you live alone you'll find
That it's much harder than
So much harder to believe
House that we used to live in
House where I left my heart
House that we used to live in falling apart
Our house was not a home
And we both felt alone it seems
It is empty now
Worn and broken like our dreams
This is the house we used to live in
This is a place in our green town
This is the house we used to live in
One look before they tear it down
House that we used to live in
House where I left my heart
House that we used to live in falling apart
Falling apart
House we used, used to live inEmbed
