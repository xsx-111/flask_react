Deep Black LyricsDeep black look at me
Tell me what will be will be
Deep black compromise
When I look into your eyes
Deep black lies
Deep black can't you see
All the things you meant to me
Deep black jealousy
Every time you look at me
Deep black lies
Deep black what you are
Doesn't matter anymore
Deep black tragedy
You've got you and I've got me
Deep black liesEmbed
