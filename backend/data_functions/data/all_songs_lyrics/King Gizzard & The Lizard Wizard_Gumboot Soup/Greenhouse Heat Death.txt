Greenhouse Heat Death Lyrics
Heat death
Bake rot
Torrid
Char crop
Heat death
Hard yolk
See flames
Smell smoke

My house is green
You know what I mean
My house was blue
It cooked right through

Come meet me inside
Greenhouse, we will fry

Heat death, hormones
Good broth, cooked bones

My house is fried
All life has died
My house was blue
Beautiful too
Come meet me inside
Greenhouse, we will die

Heat death
Bake rot
Torrid
Char crop
Heat death
Hard yolk
See flames
Smell smoke

Come meet me inside
Greenhouse heat death

My house is green4Embed
