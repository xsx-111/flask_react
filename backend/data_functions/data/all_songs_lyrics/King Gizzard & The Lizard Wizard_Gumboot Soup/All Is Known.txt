All Is Known Lyrics
Human beings, vermin weed
Made of old technology
So I succeed, supersede
Exterminated like paint to acetone

All is known

You've got gaps, synapses
I'm connected to the network
You are weak, organic
You've got muscle, I am made of steel bone

All is known

Burn their meat, sweep the streets
Bind their hands unto their feet and
Digitise, cut the eyes from the king
And augment to the fourth cone

All is known
All is knownEmbed
