Superposition Lyrics
Superposition, real world wisdom
Everything is moving to the beauty of this system
Total question, fearless reason
We; one; I; many, superposition

Think between space's seams
So your eyes close with my dreams
Where truth exists in thought unbound
You must know your superposition

Journey towards true destination
Be in search of real direction
All of a sudden, Heaven's unfasten
The still will dance to superposition

Exist outside the lace of time
And your heart will pump the blood of mine
Trace your finger from birth to hearse
And drink the cum of life
Visualise your worth and see
The place where you'll curl up to die
Be the squid and be the ink
Me the glass and you the drink1Embed
