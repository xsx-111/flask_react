Down the Sink Lyrics
On the street, people make things happen
Concrete buildings greet the skyline
People meet by the subway station
Feel the heat from the sidewalk pavement

Under the city, people's dreams collecting
Look down the sinkhole in the kitchen basin

Down the sink
Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams
Down you'll go
You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street
You follow the drain, spinning around again and again, again and again
Once you're in
Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean
Bow your head

The street is where, the street is where people live
The street is where, the street is where people die

On the beat, cops patrol the alley
People cheat one another for some
Hanging meat in the butcher's window
Bittersweet stench from in the gutter
Under the city, people's dreams collecting
Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin

Down the sink
Back and forth, follow the stream, the city is bleak, forget all your dreams
Down you'll go
You can't compete, whatever it is, you can't defeat the pull of the street
You'll follow the drain, spinning around again and again, again and again
Once you're in
Forget every place you've ever been, the city is dark, you'll never be clean
Bow your head

The street is where, the street is where people live
The street is where, the street is where people live
The street is where, the street is where people live
The street is where, the street is where people die

Under the city, people's dreams collecting
Look down the plughole in the kitchen basin
Down the sink
Down the sink
Down the sink
Down the sinkEmbed
