The Last Oasis Lyrics
Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, a sheet of water
Heat perfusion, search the corners

The last oasis is like a fragile flower in a necropolis
Alone in this weather that covers our world
The last oasis is floating like a lost astronaut - Adagio
We have nowhere to go

Dreamin' takes my mind away
It suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, a sheet of water
Heat profusion, search the corners

The last oasis is the rarest bird that I've ever known
Rara avis is shedding her feathers one at a time
The last oasis wobbles in the desert sands
Standing sentinel in a prison, trapped in our home

Dreamin' takes my mind away
It suffocates my brain airwaves
Dreamin' takes my mind away
And suffocates my brain airwaves
Optical illusion, sheet of water
Heat perfusion, search the corners
Optical illusion, living movements
To be proven, says Zurbuchen
The last oasis is like a flag beating in the wind
The world has wasted and the squandered lands are companionless
The last oasis shines a beacon like a lighthouse
Over lonely, countries of death like a black sea ‚Å£1Embed
