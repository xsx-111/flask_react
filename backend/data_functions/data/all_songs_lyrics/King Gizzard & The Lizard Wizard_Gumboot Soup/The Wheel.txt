The Wheel Lyrics
We only sleep at the
Wheel that steers us into our future
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future
Our minds unpack, muscles relax
We are superfluous, and in a stupor
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future

Into our future, into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

There's help in need, seek to retreat
Yet we decline without mercy
Destroying all that will keep us
Heading for a better thesis

We only sleep at the
Wheel that steers us into our future
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future
Our minds unpack, muscles relax
We are superfluous, and in a stupor
We only fall asleep willingly
At the wheel that steers us into our future
Into our future, into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

Shivering pilgrims, climb the steeper
Path to the idealistic reaper
Destroying all that will keep us
Heading for a better thesis

The wheel that steers us into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future
Into our future, into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future

With hope to prosper, what can we offer?
Our allegiance surely suffers
Destroying all that will keep us
Heading for a better thesis

The wheel that steers us into our future
The wheel that steers us into our future2Embed
