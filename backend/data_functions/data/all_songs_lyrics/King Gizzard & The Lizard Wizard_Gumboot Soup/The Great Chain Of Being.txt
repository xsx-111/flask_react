The Great Chain Of Being Lyrics
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being

I am a rock with eyes to the sky
I wait for my time to arrive
I come to disturb the flow
Dropped by a woman from a pocket in her coat
The great chain of being
Will fall to pieces in no time

The great chain of being
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)
The great chain (chain) of being (of being)

I usurp the precious stones
I have come to take the throne
I transcend the natural flesh
I will lay your god to rest
The great chain of being
Will be un-linked to start again
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being
The great chain of being

I see through your world's facade
I decide to punish God
Rocky meteor sparks fire
Burn that goddamn church to the ground
I climb stairs to push you down
I climb chains to cut you down
I disrupt natural order
Bring that sulking lamb to slaughter5Embed
