Muddy Water Lyrics
It's hot, it's mean, summer, to me
Green grass, won't last, sky blue, me too
Helicopter flying over shark bait, shark bite
Cover up, sunburn, leather skin, heatstroke
Make me dash across the amber coals to meet the sea
So cold it freezes me, my teeth are chattering
Give me over to the river, my place that loves me
Gum leaves and tea trees, the river is immortal
I'm parched, I'll cark the salty spray arrests
And no amount of bottled water, could bottle the stress
I think I’ll stop breathing and sink, I'm a boy, I'm not a buoy
I'm paralyzed, I'm paranoid, out of my element

I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water

It's hot, it's mean, the beach, to me
Green grass, won't grow, sky blue, me too
I don't care for cricket, and I don’t care for waves
And I don't care for amour propre or sandy bays
So I'll jump into the river when you jump into the sea
I feel the hungry fishes come to nibble at my feet
I lay upon the driftwood underneath the willow tree
And let the muscle men on the beach, bask in vanity
I shall choose this life for me
Any day, anyway, any day, anyway, any day, anyway
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water
I prefer the muddy water

I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water (I prefer the muddy water)
I prefer the muddy water ⁣⁣⁣⁣4Embed
