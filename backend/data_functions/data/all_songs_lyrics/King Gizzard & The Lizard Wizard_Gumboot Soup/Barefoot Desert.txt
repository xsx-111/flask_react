Barefoot Desert Lyrics
Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

It's a misconcepted
Story from perspective
Lost in a barefoot desert

Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stress

I stand here corrected
Misguided, rejected
Lost in a barefoot desert

So who am I to judge? Too stubborn to budge
When I'm down here and you're way up above
Shoulda put some shoes on before I left the bus
Now I've been neglected
I'm the last one stranded
Lost in a barefoot desert
Why can't I leave? What's stopping me from this prison?
Straight-jacket and shackles at my feet, I'm grounded
Throw away the key for eternity, I'm desperate

Lately I'm aware, unprepared, barefoot desert
Breathing down my neck, unprepared, barefoot desert
Never think ahead, unprepared, barefoot desert
Come on in, if you dare, to my capsule of stressEmbed
