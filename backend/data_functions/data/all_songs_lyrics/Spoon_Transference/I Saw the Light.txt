I Saw the Light Lyrics
Whenever your love can find me
It break through the walls that bind me
It's breaking the walls that bind me
And I go out in the world
I make my case to the world
I sell the world unto the world
It asks me back again
It calls me Love, holds me tight

It peels off them ties that bind me
Mmm, I don't need a thing to remind me
That I'm part of the world

I saw the light
I saw the light
And I felt all jeaned on in white
I felt so permanently alive

I saw the light
I saw the light
And I felt all creamed on in white
I felt so permanently alive
I saw the light
I saw the light
I saw the light
And I felt all creamed on in white
I felt so permanently alive2Embed
