Before Destruction Lyrics
Before destruction, a man's heart is haughty
Before destruction, a man
A man's heart is haughty
Ooh
Everyone loves you for your black eye
They feast on the abundance of your house

Your love
Won't you believe?
Oh, won't you believe now?

Just as you're leaving, you turn around and take a cold shot
Just as you're turning your back
Oh, I

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh, ah
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, love
Your love
Make a cold 
Your love
Your love2Embed
