Goodnight Laura Lyrics
Goodnight Laura, don't you know
Your bed awaits and now it's time for sleeping?

Goodnight Laura, close your eyes
You words are meant to stop at night
You know they're not for keeping
If you want to fall asleep be very still
And you close your eyes, and slow yourself
And let the worry leave you, and let go if it all just for this evening
Alright
You can fall asleep by being very still
As you let your breath slow down
And when you think your thoughts be sure that they are sweet ones
They are sweet ones

Don't you know, Laura, you're alright?
You're alrightEmbed
