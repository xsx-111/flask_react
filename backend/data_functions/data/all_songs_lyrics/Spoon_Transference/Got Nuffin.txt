Got Nuffin Lyrics
When I'm with you, all my brothers, oh I feel like a king
It feels like I'm dreaming
When that blood goes rattling through my veins
My ears start to ring
I notice what matters

And I got nothing to lose but darkness and shadows
Got nothing to lose but bitterness and patterns

When I can't find the way to reach you my love
I'm just not the same
Just ain't the same
When I know you're watching out for me
I know what I'm knowing
I can see what matters

And I got nothing to lose but darkness and shadows
Got nothing to lose but emptiness and hang-ups

Oh, when I know you're watching out for me
I look for what matters
And I notice what matters
And I got nothing to lose but darkness and shadows
Got nothing to lose but loneliness and patterns
The flowers blooming, the trains collide
I don't got a thing to loseEmbed
