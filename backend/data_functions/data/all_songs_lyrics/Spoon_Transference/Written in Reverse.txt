Written in Reverse Lyrics
I'm writing this to you in reverse
Someone better call a hearse
I can see it all from here
From just a few glimpses
Now that lightbulb's gone off
And it's pulling my wince
And now the lightbulb's gone off
I've seen it in your eyes
I've seen you blankly stare
And I want to show you how I love you
But there's nothing there

I'm not standing here!
Oh I'm not standing here!
And I'm writing in reverse
I know it could be worse
I'm not standing here, I'm not standing here
(I'm not standing here, I'm not standing here)
(And I'm writing in reverse, I know it could be worse)
And I hear that famous song
And I hear that can't be wrong

No nothing was planned
You just can't help yourself
Some people are so easily shuffled and dealt
If there's only one of us you truly felt
We're getting you raw
And it feels real good
Although only briefly
Like high school poppers would
Will you lose a bit of yourself?
Will you lose a bit of yourself?
I'm not standing here!
Oh I'm not standing here!
And I'm writing in reverse
I know it could be worse
I hear that famous song
And I hear that can't be wrong
All I know, is all I know
Yes, all I know, is all I know
Is all I know

I'm writing this to you in reverse
Someone better call a hearse (woo!)
I can see it all from here
From just a few glimpses
Now that lightbulb's gone off
And it's pulling my wince
And now the lightbulb's gone off
I've seen it in your eyes
And there's nothing there
There's nothing there
I wanna show you how I love you
I can see you blankly stare2Embed
