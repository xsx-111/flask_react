Is Love Forever? Lyrics
I grew up in a supermarket, it was there they told me
If they can't find me, they won't leave without me now or ever
All I need's a word to get me started, all I need's a look
Some ex-girlfriend, call her Heather
Whispers to me: "Is love forever?"
Is love forever?
Is love?

Are you quite certain, love?
Are you quite certain, love?
Are you quite certain, love?
Are you quite certain, love?
Are you quite certain, love?
(When I'm older, start to wonder)
Are you quite certain, love?
(Was that love or instinct working?)
Are you quite certain, love?
(Have I even felt it ever?)
Are you quite certain, love?
(What's the object? Is love forever?)
Ah, love!

Is love forever?Embed
