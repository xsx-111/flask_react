Out Go the Lights Lyrics
You walk into the ballroom like
The cough, the wind, the rain was right
And all them heads went left to right
Then out with the lights
It was a break in time
I know your mechanisms
You became like that
On which your heart was fixed
Before I knew what was which
Out with the lights
There's a picture of you
Standing there in my black wig
Looking like, who thinks they know who
Standing there in my black wig
I came here for the noise
You always look good that way
You with the one-two punch from Illinois
If you lean any harder
That window breaks at the bone
And when that light turns back again
You will remember the way
They fall for you like a brick
Oh but nobody loves you
Or woos you when you're down or kicked
Out go the lights
Never see that counterpoint
You always look good that way
You with the one-two punch
You always look good that wayEmbed
