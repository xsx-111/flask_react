Nobody Gets Me But You LyricsNobody gets what I say
Must be some way to convey
But no one else remembers my name
Just those parts that I play
Nobody gets me
Nobody gets me but you
No one gets what I've done
Everyone else seems to look through it
Oh, but maybe I've never wanted them to
Couldn't count on it anyway
Nobody gets me
Nobody cuts me like you
Nobody gets what I say
Those who know, those who lose
Those who look through me
Do they get me?
I thought they get me like you
Oh no!
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
No
Oh no oneEmbed
