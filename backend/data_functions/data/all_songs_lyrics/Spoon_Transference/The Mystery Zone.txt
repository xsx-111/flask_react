The Mystery Zone Lyrics
Picture yourself
Set up for good in a whole other life
Ooh, in the mystery zone
Make us a house
Some far-away town
Where nobody will know us well
Where your dad's not around
And all the trouble
You look for all your life
You will find it for sure
In the mystery zone

Times that we met

Opening windows
Doors never close
It's the fresh-air fiend
Mmm, it's the information troll
We'll pack a bag
Sendin' it off
Just some things that never fit right
To the m—
And we'll send it ahead as a test so we'll know
Call it up when it gets there
What's it like in the mystery zone?

The times that we met
Before we met
We'll go back there
Oh, times that we met before
We'll go back
We'll go back there
The mystery zone
Ooh!
To the mystery zone
