Learning Lyrics
No one'll answer your prayers
'Til you take off that dress
No one'll hear all your crying
'Til you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

No one'll answer your prayers
'Til you take off that dress
No one'll hear all your crying
'Til you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

Your father before you
And your sister too
Your husband and blah, blah, blah, blah
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, youEmbed
