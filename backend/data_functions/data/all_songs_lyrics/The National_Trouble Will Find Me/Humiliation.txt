Humiliation Lyrics
I survived the dinner
Then the air went thinner
I retire to the briars
By the pool, it gets so loud
If I die this instant
Taken from the distance
They will probably list it down
Among other things around town
Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

And all the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimmin'
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job
And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, "Babe, you're better off"
I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down
In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave my little life today

As a free fall advances
I'm the moron who dances
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I was teething on roses
I was in guns and noses
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Under the withering white skies of humiliation
Under the withering white skies of humiliation

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today

She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it12Embed
