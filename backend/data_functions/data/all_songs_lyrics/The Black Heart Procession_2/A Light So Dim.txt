A Light So Dim LyricsThere are no trains that leave from the maze
My only chance was a ship to escape
If you be the light house in the storm
I'll be the ship with a thousand dead souls
But how long will they believe in a light so dim
Down in the gallows the darkness glows
It was hard to see in the hearts of them
If you see a light call down below
I'll be moving and sorting out our tears
But how long will we believe in a light so dim
Time is all we have
So take the time
To make the time
Throw down the line I'll see to climb
If it's held close it may just work
If you are the light house in the storm
I'll be the ship filled with a thousand dead souls
Time is all we have
So take the time
To make the time1Embed
