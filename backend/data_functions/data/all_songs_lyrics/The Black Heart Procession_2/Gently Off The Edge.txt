Gently Off The Edge LyricsThere was a murder and a heart on some other road
It was colored drinks but most of all this empty seat next to me
And I felt life getting older and something had to unfold
And if there's a chance that I could be with you
As a distant ring something in your mind
And you would think of me when you are away
There was a ring in a film that was dated 1863
But dead men can't tell the truth of lies is what filled up his day
And we feel life getting older as something has to unfold
If there's a chance that I could be with you
As a distant ring something in your mind
And you would think of me when you are away
Listen to my call please come home
Come home come home cause I feel so alone
You listen you listen but nobody's there
You wait for a sign will they appear
You know they'll say that I am the oneEmbed
