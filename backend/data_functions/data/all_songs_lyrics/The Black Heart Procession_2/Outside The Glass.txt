Outside The Glass LyricsI never knew what you were trying to say
You spoke to me from outside the glass
I could never understand your words
I never knew what you were trying to say
I saw you place your hand over your heart
And I can hear the waves just outside your gate
I'm going away
I'm going away
And this space I leave for you
For the rest of my life
I'm going away
I can hear the waves
I'm going away
You spoke to me from outside the glass
I never knew what you were trying to say
I'm going awayEmbed
