When We Reach The Hill LyricsSomething scared you and when you moved
Your stitches pulled not yet removed
We formed this link a thousand years before
Then you turn and say
If you leave how can you leave on this hook
Cause we'll grow old here, you can never leave
Cause we'll grow old, you can never leave
And what keeps me here has grown into me
And I can't tear free a style awaits to coin us
And I peg you
Yes I seal the mold then you turn and say
If you leave how can you leave on this hook
Cause we'll grow old here, you will never leave
Cause we'll grow old, you will never leave
When we reach the hill
When we reach the hillEmbed
