My Heart Might Stop LyricsPlease don't be too long for my heart might just stop someday
You were looking but I couldn't find cause I didn't know
They had come for you on ships of gold to take you away
Please don't be too long for my heart might just stop someday
Outside the sky lit up and I didn't know what I would say
When they came for you on ships of gold to take you away
I just watched you leave I never spoke a wordEmbed
