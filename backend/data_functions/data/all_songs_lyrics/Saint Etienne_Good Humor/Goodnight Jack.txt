Goodnight Jack LyricsWe hadn't had our tea for long
When you said there's something wrong
Can I take this once again
You know I'd like to be a friend
Behind the wheel of my Capri
It seems it like no-ones noticed me
And now you're coming out from work
And deep inside I feel so hurt
I saw the people crowding round
You didn't move or make a sound
Sky so overcast and grey
And something happened here today
She's got to run
Run away from home
You know she's gotta run
Run away from home
She's got to run
You know she's gotta run
Run away from homeEmbed
