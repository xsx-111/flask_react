Dutch TV LyricsOne night in Netherlands checking out the Amsterdam scene
Got a room from some old guy outside the rocking machine
Don't know who you are but you can't come in
Turn the TV down, kick the TV in
Old pictures scattered round, all soaked in alcohol
Next thing the lights go out, I heard a bang on the wall
Don't know who you are but you can't come in
Turn the TV down, kick the TV in
Don't know who you are but you can't come in
Turn the TV down, kick the TV inEmbed
