Sylvie Lyrics
Seventeen, high-school queen
Yeah, you're pretty cute, I can see
Well, you've come a long way since September
But, Sylvie, you oughtta remember
You know he's mine, you know he's mine, you know he's mine
Sylvie, girl, I'm a very patient person
But I'll have to shut you down if you don't give up your flirting
Leave him alone cause I know he loves me
Leave him alone cause he tells me he loves me

Over and over and over and over again

Seventeen, high-school queen
Yeah, you're pretty cute, I can see
Well, you've come a long way since September
But, Sylvie, you oughtta remember
You know he's mine, you know he's mine, you know he's mine
Sylvie, girl, although you're my little sister
Well you're not without your charms
I'm not sure that he'll resist you
Give it all up for we see you crying
Give it all up cause I know you've been trying
Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
Over and over and over and over again
(Oh, Sylvie girl, oh Sylvie girl)
Over and over and over and over again
(Oh, Sylvie girl, oh Sylvie girl)
Over and over and over and over again
(Oh, Sylvie girl, oh Sylvie girl)
Over and over and over and over again
(Oh, Sylvie girl, oh Sylvie girl)
(Oh, Sylvie girl, oh Sylvie girl)
(Oh, Sylvie girl, oh Sylvie girl)Embed
