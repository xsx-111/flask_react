Lose That Girl LyricsShe walked out on you last Saturday
Under the wheels
Of a crowd on main street USA
Know how it feels
She said cancel everything
And like a fool
You never see what's happening
She dropped out school
Get away let her go
Let her go now
Hey in your brain
Yeah you know
Let her go now
I should have told you
To lose that girl
I should have told you
That's not your world
On her radio she'd turn the disco down
Disco down
She thought she looked good in purple jeans
From Santa Fe
And she overdosed on magazines
Just fade to greyEmbed
