The Bad Photographer LyricsLast Thursday, 5:30, a shoot in Ladbroke Grove
Hours later, hey waiter, could you pour some more of those
(All for you) And when I'm all alone
(All for you) I'm by the microphone (all for you)
(All for you) I see your photograph
(All for you) Don't even want (all for you) to laugh
Some secret must keep it, hey I wouldn't know who to tell
Next morning, fair warning, ooh you have you got something to sell
(All for you) And when I'm all alone
(All for you) I'm by the microphone (all for you)
(All for you) I see your photograph
(All for you) Don't even want (all for you) to laugh
Wide awake, the cold cold light of day
Realise my taste, my taste just slips away
I say my taste just slips away
(All for you) And when I'm all alone
(All for you) I'm by the microphone (all for you)
(All for you) I see your photograph
(All for you) Don't even want (all for you) to laugh
Days later saw the paper, how did I fall for you...
(All for you) And when I'm all alone
(All for you) I'm by the microphone (all for you)
(All for you) I see your photograph
(All for you) Don't even want (all for you) to laugh
(All for you) And when I'm all alone
(All for you) I'm by the microphone (all for you)
(All for you) I see your photograph
(All for you) Don't even want (all for you) to laughEmbed
