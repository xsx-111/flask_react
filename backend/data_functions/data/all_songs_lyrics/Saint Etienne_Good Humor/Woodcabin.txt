Woodcabin LyricsA redwood tree
The radio
They moved them down the hall
A beauty queen from Idaho
Was broken in the fall
Never write a love song
Never write a trip hop
Never write a ballad
Got to get a grip now
'Cause nothing ever matters
If you hide away from it all
In twenty years this place will be
Just like L.A. today
Never write a love song
Never write a trip hop
Never write a ballad
Got to get a grip now
Cause nothing ever matters
If you hide away from it all
Never write a love songEmbed
