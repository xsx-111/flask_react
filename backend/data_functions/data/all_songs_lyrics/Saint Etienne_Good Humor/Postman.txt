Postman LyricsOn a fog-bound morning
With my frozen tiger feet
All done so I clocked off early
Walked down our street
Oh no oh no
Do I really deserve this
Silhouettes at the window
It's so hard to believe this
Silhouettes at the window
I was only lonely
Only thinking of you
I suspected nothing
Put all my trust in you
Now my pride's in a thousand pieces
World slides from view
Oh no oh no
Do I really deserve this
Silhouettes at the window
It's so hard to believe this
Silhouettes at the window
I was only lonely
Only thinking of youEmbed
