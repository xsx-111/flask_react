Been So Long LyricsI knew when you
Came around here to see me
You'd stay here till the morning
Can't stop myself from falling
In love with you
You know we'll never be the same
Been so long
It's been so long
I'm tired of being alone
There's a way to go
Honey I know now I'm calling you on the phone
Pretending nothing has changed here
A strangely familiar trap to fall in
You came without a warning
I'm glad you're here
To take these lonely tears away
Been so long
It's been so long
I'm tired of being alone
There's a way to go
Honey I know now I'm calling you on the phone
On the phone
Been so long
It's been so long
I'm tired of being alone
There's a way to go
Honey I know now I'm calling you on the phone
On the phone
On the phoneEmbed
