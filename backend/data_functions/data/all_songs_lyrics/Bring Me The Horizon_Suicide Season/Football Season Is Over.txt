Football Season Is Over Lyrics
Why the fuck can I not hail a taxi?
Arm out like a Nazi, every cunt's driving past
Where the fuck is everyone?
I can't see anyone, I can't see anything

The hardest part of today is a hangover
Empty bottles and empty promises
The hardest part of today is a hangover
I got every person I need
And it's gonna be one hell of a messy night
I can't remember last night, I can't remember anything
I can't remember last night, I can't remember anything

Turn this fuckin' shit up!

Party till you pass out, drink till you're dead
Dance all night till you can't feel your legs
Party till you pass out, drink till you're dead
Dance all fucking night
Party till you pass out, drink till you're dead
Dance all night till you can't feel your legs
Party till you pass out, drink till you're dead
Dance all fucking night
We are done with giving a fuck
*Cheering*
I'm so drunk, I can't even see anymore2Embed
