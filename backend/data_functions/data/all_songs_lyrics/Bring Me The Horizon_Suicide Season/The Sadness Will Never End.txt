The Sadness Will Never End Lyrics
Our legs begin to break, we've walked this path for far too long
My lungs, they start to ache, but still, we carry on
I'm chokin' on my words like I got a noose around my neck
I can't believe it's come to this, I can't believe it's got to this
And dear, I fear that this ship is sinkin' tonight

I won't give up on you, these scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me, it's not too late for us
And I'll save you from yourself
And I'll save you from yourself

Our legs begin to break, we've walked this path for far too long
My lungs begin to ache, but still, we carry on
I'm chokin' on my words like I got a noose around my neck
I'm not comin' home tonight, I'm not comin' home tonight
'Cause, dear, I fear, oh, dear, I fear
I'm not comin' home tonight, I'm not comin' home tonight
'Cause, dear, I fear this ship is sinkin'
Is there hope for us? Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure on your lips
Is there hope for us? Can we make it out alive?
I can taste the failure
Close your eyes, there's nothing we can do
But sleep in this bed that we made for ourselves
You're trapped in your past like it's six feet under
I won't give up on you, these scars won't tear us apart
So don't give up on me, it's not too late for us
I'll save you from yourself, I'll save you from yourself
I'll save you from yourself, I'll save you from yourself

Try to numb the pain with alcohol and pills
But it won't repair your trust
You can't stand on two fuckin' feet
With a substance as a crutch

Yeah, I won't give up
I won't give up on you, we'll sing this symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you, we'll sing this symphony of sympathy
I won't give up
I won't give up on you, we'll sing this symphony, a symphony
I won't give up
I won't give up on you, we'll sing this symphony of sympathy8Embed
