Death Breath Lyrics
The sun goes down, we come out, a different party in a different city
The sun comes up, we come down, we lived fast and died pretty
We're all vampires and we own this fucking night
We're all vampires and we own this fucking
I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home, of going home
I've been walking these streets for days in search of blood

Yeah, I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
Yeah, I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight until it breaks
You can't kill us, we will never fucking die

The sun goes down, we come out, a different party in a different city
The sun comes up, we come down, we lived fast and died pretty
We're all vampires and we own this fucking night
We're all vampires and we own this fucking (Night)
I want to sink my teeth into all of you, all of you
If only I could make you see how sweet this could be, how sweet this could be

Yeah, I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
Yeah, I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight until it breaks
You can't kill us
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth, so spit it out, so spit it out
But you leave a bad taste in my mouth, so spit it out, so spit it out
You leave a bad taste in my mouth, so spit it out, so spit it out
You leave a bad taste in my mouth, so spit it out, spit it out

Yeah, I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
Yeah, I'd do anything
Yeah, I'd kill for the sun to never rise again
Yeah, I'd do anything, oh anything
So tie a rope around my neck, pull it tight until it breaks
You can't kill us, we will never fucking die

I'm not homesick, I'm just so sick of going home, of going home
I've been walking these streets for days in search of blood6Embed
