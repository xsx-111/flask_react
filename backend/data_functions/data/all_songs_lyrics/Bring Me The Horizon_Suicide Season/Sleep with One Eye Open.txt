Sleep with One Eye Open Lyrics
Fuck you

You took what you wanted and left, like locusts
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You bled me dry and then went, like leeches
Go, you got what you could now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back may as well have disappeared
For as long as I remember, you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, you're on your fucking own

Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open

If I had it my way I'd slit your throat with the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you, I'm inside of you
I'm inside of you, I'm inside of you
And this is your world, fucking falling apart, mate
From the inside out, everything will fall apart at your feet
You got hell to pay, yeah, you got hell to pay
And you better fucking bow down to me
You better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open
Sleep with one eye open

Best friends means forever
Best friends means forever
