Chelsea Smile Lyrics
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

It sits in silence, eats away at me
It feeds like cancer, this guilt could fill a fucking sea
Pulling teeth, wolves at my door
Now falling and failing is all I know
This disease is getting worse
I counted my blessings, now I'll count this curse

The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret, yeah
The only thing I really know: I can't sleep at night
I'm buried and breathing in regret

I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know
I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

I may look happy, but honestly, dear
The only way I'll really smile is if you cut me ear to ear
I see the vultures, they watch me bleed
They lick their lips, as all my shame spills out of me

Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for
Repent, repent, the end is nigh
Repent, repent, we're all gonna die
Repent, repent, these secrets will kill us
So get on your knees and pray for forgiveness

We all carry these things inside that no one else can see
They hold us down like anchors, they drown us out at sea
I look up to the sky, there may be nothing there to see
But if I don't believe in him, why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?
Why would he believe in me?

I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you don't know

I've got a secret
It's on the tip of my tongue
It's on the back of my lungs
And I'm gonna keep it
I know something you will never know

You will never know
I know something you don't know22Embed
