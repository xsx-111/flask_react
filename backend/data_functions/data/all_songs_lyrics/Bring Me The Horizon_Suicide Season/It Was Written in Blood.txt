It Was Written in Blood Lyrics
Goodbye, my friend, goodbye, my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part
And be reunited by and by, united by and by
Goodbye, no handshake to endure, now there's nothing

It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood

Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow
There's nothing new in dying now

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
And it was written in blood

It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, oh, God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood on a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart, fall apart
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart
We fall apart
Like roses, we fall apart, fall apart

Though living is no newer, though living is no newer
(It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note
The day before he died)

It was written in blood, it was written in blood
It was written in blood, my God, written in blood
It was written in blood, it was written in blood
Oh, my God, it was written in blood

Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We fall apart (Fall apart)
We fall apart (Fall apart)
Fall apart
We fall
Like roses
Like roses
Roses (Roses)
Roses (Like roses)
Like roses
Like roses (Like roses)11Embed
