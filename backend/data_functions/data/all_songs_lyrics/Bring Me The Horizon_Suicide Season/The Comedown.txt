The Comedown Lyrics
Urgh!

Here I am, once again, just like a pack of wolves
The skies were once, paved with gold now they rain on us all
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it
I've dug my grave so I'll die in it

(Tell all my friends, I said goodbye)
(Clenched teeth and fluttering eyes)
(I can't go on like this)
Tell all my friends, I said goodbye
Clenched teeth and fluttering eyes
I can't go on like this

Just like the living dead, yeah, I've got a taste for something
And I don't want it, I just need it and I can't believe that
It's getting harder just to feel alive
It's getting harder just to feel alive

Curtains close, take a bow, I think we fooled all of them now
Who you are, what you say, what you do each and every single day
I've made my bed so I'll lie in it
I've dug my grave so, God, help me die in it
Just like the living dead, yeah, I've got a taste for something
And I don't want it, I just need it and I can't believe that
Just like the living dead, yeah, I've got a taste for something
And I don't want it, I just need it and I can't believe that

And I dug my grave, so I'll lie in it, lie in it, lie in it
I've made my bed, so I'll die in it, die in it
I dug my grave
And I dug my grave
I'd rather live than live forever
I'm knocking on Death's door, but you're already dead
It's either now or fucking never
And that night we meant every word we said, all I can say
All I can say for sure is, we're coming out tonight
All I can say for sure is, we're coming up tonight

Just like the living dead, just like the living dead
Just like the living dead, I've got a taste for something
And I don't want it, I just need it and I can't believe that
Just like the living dead, yeah, I've got a taste for something
And I don't want it, I just need it and I can't believe that
Just like the living dead, yeah, I've got a taste for something
And I don't want it, I just need it and I can't believe that
It's getting harder just to feel alive
It's getting harder just to feel alive3Embed
