I Loved You Yesterday LyricsCan you tell me
What you see in him
He looks just like
All of the others did
And can you tell me
If it will ever end
Can you tell me
Or do you know
I could tell you
What I saw in you
And I could tell you
Why I still see it too
And I could tell you
If you would just let me through
I could tell you
Because I know
I loved you yesterday
And I love you just the same
And none of the things you do
Could tear us apart
I loved you yesterday
And I love you just the same
When I gave myself to you
You took only my heart
Can you tell me
What he says to you
Does he tell you
The same things I used to
But can he tell you
The way you want him to
Can you tell me
Or do you know
I loved you yesterday
And I love you just the same
And none of the things you do
Could tear us apart
I loved you yesterday
And I love you just the same
When I gave myself to you
You took only my heart
Yo te quise ayer
Y yo te quiero the same
And none of things you do
Could tear us apart
Yo te quise ayer
Y yo te quiero the same
When I gave myself to you
You took only my heartEmbed
