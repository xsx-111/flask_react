Walk Through the Bottomland LyricsA New Jersey lady I knew long ago
And she was a lady I say
But she met a cowboy who rode on the rodeo
And he stole her heart straight away
The New Jersey lady she loved him so true
Another love she never had
But cowboys are lonesome and cowboys are blue
And they make the ladies so sad
Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The New Jersey lady knew he loved her too
And you know she tried to hold on
But the rodeo life was the life that he knew
He had to keep drifting along
She never married and she never would
And all of the people they'd say
The New Jersey lady she just ain't no good
To follow a cowboy that way
Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The lady she'd sing him to sleep in the night
And then in the morning he'd go
She loved the darkness and hated the light
Along with that damn rodeo
The New Jersey lady the day that he died
She covered him over with clay
And feeling the wind in the night as she cried
She heard the old cowboy say
Sing me a melody
Sing me a blues
Walk through the bottomland without no shoes
The Brazos she's running scared
She heard the news
Walk through the bottomland without no shoesEmbed
