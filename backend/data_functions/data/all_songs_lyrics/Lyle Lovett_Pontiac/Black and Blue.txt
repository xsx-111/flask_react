Black and Blue LyricsIt's a Saturday night
You check the TV guide
And pray the black and white
Can keep you satisfied
She had yellow hair
She had high-heel shoes
She read the whole affair
And left you black and blue
In 1956
She was just a kiss
In 1985
How could she come to this?
He had yellow hair
He liked high-heel shoes
Lipstick was everywhere
And he left her black and blue
So it's a Saturday night
You check the TV guide
And pray you'll be alright
Because it's your turn this time
See, she had yellow hair
She had high-heel shoes
Lipstick was everywhere
And you left her black and blue
What's it to you?
It's black and blueEmbed
