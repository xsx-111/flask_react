L.A. County LyricsShe left Dallas for California
With an old friend at her side
Well he did not say much
But one year later
He'd ask her to be his wife
And the lights of L.A. County
They look like diamonds in the sky
When you're driving through the hours
With an old friend at your side
One year later I left Houston
With an old friend at my side
Well it did not say much
But it was a beauty
Of a coal black .45
And the lights of L.A. County
They look like diamonds in the sky
When you're driving through the hours
With an old friend at your side
So I drove on all the day long
And I drove on through the night
And I thought of her a'waiting
For to be his blushing bride
And the lights of L.A. County
They looked like diamonds in the sky
As I drove into the valley
With my old friend at my side
And as she stood there at the altar
All dressed in her gown of white
Lord her face was bright as the stars a'shining
Like I'd dreamed of all my life
And they kissed each other
And they turned around
And they saw me standing in the aisle
Well I did not say much
I just stood there watching
As that .45 told them goodbye
And the lights of L.A. County
Look like diamonds in the sky
When you're kneeling at the altar
With an old friend at your side
And the lights of L.A. County
Are a mighty pretty sight
When you're kneeling at the altar
With an old friend at your sideEmbed
