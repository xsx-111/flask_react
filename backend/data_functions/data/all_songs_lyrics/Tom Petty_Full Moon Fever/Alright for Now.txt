Alright for Now Lyrics
Goodnight baby, sleep tight, my love
May God watch over you from above
Tomorrow I'm working, what would I do?
I'd be lost and lonely if not for you

So close your eyes
We're alright for now

I've spent my life traveling, spent my life free
I could not repay all you've done for me
So sleep tight, baby, unfurrow your brow
And know I love you, we're alright for now

We're alright for now1Embed
