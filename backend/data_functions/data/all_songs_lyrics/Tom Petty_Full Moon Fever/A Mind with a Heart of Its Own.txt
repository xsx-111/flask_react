A Mind with a Heart of Its Own Lyrics
I remember her standing in the tall grass and cattails
Away from the windows at the end of the day
Watch the men from the landing with tall hats and coat-tails
She'd never look different, but something would change

A mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
Yeah, a mind with a heart of its own

Well, the man out to end us had a hurricane business
He'd raise them from babies all by his-self
But his teenage accountant had become surrounded
He drank up the party and everyone left

A mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
Yeah, a mind with a heart of its own

Well I been to Brooker, and I been to Micanopy
I been to St. Louis too, I been all around the world
I've been over to your house and you've been over sometimes to my house
I've slept in your treehouse, my middle name is Earl
A mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
Yeah, a mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
A mind with a heart of its own
Yeah, a mind with a heart of its ownEmbed
