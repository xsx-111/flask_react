All the Critics Love U in New York Lyrics
You can dance if you want to
All the critics love you in New York
You don't have to keep the beat
They'll still think it's neat
In New York
You can wear what you want to, it doesn't matter
In New York
You could cut off all your hair
I don't think they'd care
In New York

All the critics love you in New York

Why you can play what you want to
All the critics love you in New York
They won't say that you're naive
If you play what you believe
In New York
Purple love-amour is all you're headed for, but don't show it
The reason that you're cool
Is because you're from the old school
And they know it
All the critics love you in New York

You can dance if you want to
All the critics love you in New York
You can dance if you want to
All the critics love you in New York

All the critics love you
All the critics love you
All the critics love you in New York

It's time for a new direction
It's time for jazz to die
Fourth day of November
We need a purple high
Don't give up, I'll still love you

All the critics love you in New York
All the critics love you in New York
All the critics love you
All the critics love you
All the critics love you in New York
Body don't want to quit, got to get another hit
Body don't want to quit, got to get another hit
Body don't want to quit, got to get another hit
Body don't want to quit, got to get another hit

All the critics love you
All the critics love you
All the critics love you in New York

Whattaya looking at, punk?
Look out all you hippies, you ain't as sharp as me
It ain't about the tripping, but the sexuality, turn it up
You can dance if you want to

All the critics love you in New York
All the critics love you in New York

Yes, we're certain of it, he's definitely masturbating

All the critics love you in New York
Take a bath, hippies

All the critics love you in New York
All the critics love you in New York
All the critics love you in New York
All the critics love you in New York

New York
New York
New York
New York
