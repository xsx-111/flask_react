Fresh as a Daisy Lyrics
Well, if you come from Heaven
You know that that's okay
Just as long as you're here to help me
It doesn't matter how long you stay

Talking 'bout you, baby
Don't you know you're fresh as a daisy
As fresh as a daisy?

Well, tell me, can you feel it?
I'm felling alright myself
I'm changing my old habits
And I've found a new bill of health

All because of you, baby
Don't you know you're fresh as a daisy
As fresh as a daisy?
As fresh as a daisy?

You do the things you do very well
You make me feel the way I've never felt
You make me feel the way I've never felt
Don't know how I'll feel tomorrow
Tomorrow's another day
I like everything about you
What more is there to say?

Talking 'bout you, baby
Don't you know you're fresh as a daisy
As fresh as a daisy?
Talking 'bout you, baby
Don't you know you're fresh as a daisy
As fresh as a daisy?

Hooray, the Lord is good to his children
Hooray, the Lord is good to his children
Hooray, the Lord is good to his children
Hooray, the Lord is good to his children
Hooray, the Lord is good to his children
Hooray, the Lord is good to his childrenEmbed
