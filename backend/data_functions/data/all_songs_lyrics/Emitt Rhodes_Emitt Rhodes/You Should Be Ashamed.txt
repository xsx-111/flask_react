You Should Be Ashamed Lyrics
You've let me down too many times
Too many times to count, you've let me down
You've made me sad too many ways
Too many days went bad, you've made me sad

You should be ashamed of yourself, woman
You know you should, you ain't no good
You should be ashamed of yourself

You told me lies and I believed
You made a fool of me, you told me lies
I've tried so hard but I have failed
Can't find the words to tell the way I feel

You should be ashamed of yourself, woman
You know you should, you ain't no good
You should be ashamed of yourself

Well, I'm so glad it's over now
I'm feeling bad but still, somehow
I'm so glad it's over now
You should be ashamed of yourself, woman
You know you should, you ain't no good
You should be ashamed of yourself

Well, I'm so glad it's over now
I'm feeling bad but still somehow
I'm so glad it's over now

You've let me down too many times
Too many times to count you've let me down
You've made me sad too many ways
Too many days went bad, you've made me sad

You should be ashamed of yourself, woman
You know you should, you ain't no good
You should be ashamed of yourself
(You should be ashamed)Embed
