You Take the Dark Out of the Night Lyrics
I can't quite say that I love the place I'm in
But it's better than it's been for a long time
A while ago, I was feeling all alone
Now I'm feeling right at home here beside you

You take the dark out of the night and make it day
(You take the dark out of the night)
You take the clouds out of the sky when they turn gray
(You take the clouds out of the sky) Yeah, yeah, yeah

So love me right or don't love me now at all
If I stand, I'm bound to fall right on my face
So love me right and don't let me down again
You are bound to lose a friend if you do, babe

You take the dark out of the night and make it day
(You take the dark out of the night)
You take the clouds out of the sky when they turn gray
(You take the clouds out of the sky) Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, you know what it's like to be standing all alone
To be shivering and cold, now I'm feeling nice and warm
(You take the dark out of the night)
(You take the clouds out of the sky)
You make me feel so good, babe

I can't quite say that I love the place I'm in
But it's better than it's been for a long time
A while ago, I was feeling all alone
Now I'm feeling right at home here beside you

You take the dark out of the night and make it day
(You take the dark out of the night)
You take the clouds out of the sky when they turn gray
(You take the clouds out of the sky) Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
