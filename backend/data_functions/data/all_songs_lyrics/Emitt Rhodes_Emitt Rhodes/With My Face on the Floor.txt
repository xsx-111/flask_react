With My Face on the Floor Lyrics
Well, I'm down with my face on the floor
Yes, I got what I asked for and more
Well, the moment she stepped through that door
I was down with my face on the floor

Now I'm standing with back to the wall
Waiting, praying the ceiling don't fall
Well, I once thought that I knew it all
Now I'm standing with back to the wall

Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say, "I'll drop you a line" (drop you a line)
Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say, "I'll see you sometime"


Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say, "I'll drop you a line" (drop you a line)
Well, now she's gone away
Just took time to say, "I'll see you sometime"
Well, I'm down with my face on the floor
Yes, I got what I asked for and more
Well, the moment she stepped through that door
I was down with my face on the floor

Well, the moment she stepped through that door
I was down with my face on the floorEmbed
