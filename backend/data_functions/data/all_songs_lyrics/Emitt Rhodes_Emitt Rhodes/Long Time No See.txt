Long Time No See Lyrics
It's been a long time, I remember you well
It's been a long time no see, where you been keeping yourself?

You've been staying all alone when you should be playing
Been feeling all alone when you should be praying
It's been a long time no see

It's been a rough road to ride, says the sun in the west
It's been hard, but I get by with a moment to rest

Been thinking all the time that things will get better
And living all alone can't make me much sadder
It's been hard but I'll get by

Wooohoo
Whoa, yeah
Wooohoo

It's been a long time, I remember you well
It's been a long time no see, where you been keeping yourself?
You've been staying all alone when you should be playing
Been feeling all alone when you should be praying
It's been a long time no see

Whoa, yeah
Wooohoo
Whoa, yeah
Wooohoo
Whoa, yeahEmbed
