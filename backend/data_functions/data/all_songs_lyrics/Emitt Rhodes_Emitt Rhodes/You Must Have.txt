You Must Have Lyrics
You must have, for every raindrop, a ray of sun
You must have, for every teardrop, a smile for someone
To get by, to live your life
You must have, for every raindrop, a ray of sun

You must have, for every gray sky, a sky of blue
You must have, for every love lost, a love that's new
To get by, to live your life
You must have, for every gray sky, a sky of blue

I've been alone too long to feel right
I've been alone too long to say goodnight
Somebody help me see the light

Just spread a little sunshine
Everything will be fine
Spread a little sunshine on me

And I know you know the pain
And I feel you feel the same
Just spread a little sunshine
Everything will be fine
Spread a little sunshineEmbed
