Ever Find Yourself Running Lyrics
Ever find yourself running, running, running away?
Ever find yourself hiding from the things that you feel?

Ever hear yourself crying, crying, crying to someone?
Won't you look down from Heaven?
Won't you prove you are real?

Ever lose yourself searching, searching, searching in darkness?
With your questions unanswered, never knowing the truth

Ever feel yourself dying, dying, dying a slow death?
Heavy laden with burdens that are stealing your youth

Ever find yourself running, running, running away?
Ever find yourself hiding from the things that you feel?

Ever find yourself running?Embed
