Top of the World LyricsThe view from here's breathtaking
My visions all surrounding
The humans look like insects
There is only one way down
But it's cold and lonely in this stratosphere
Gliding through the darkness
Where is my craft leading to
Am I damned or blessed?
Don't let go on top of the world
Don't let go on top of the world
Will my good friends desert me
Or will they prove themselves?
Are my demands all greedy
Or are they what I need?
If I will not be faithful
I must accept betrayal
When your turn comes to leave me
Will my free ways have failed?
Don't let go on top of the world
Don't let go on top of the world
I'll meet you inside this hollow world
I'll meet you inside
Hollow world, hollow world
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
And I'm so coldEmbed
