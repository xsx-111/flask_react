I am ignoring all your late night calls
I prefer to sleep than feel so small
I have this feeling I'm about to crumble
And fall
Are you going to the discotheque?
Cigarettes, perfume, drink, and sweat
I prefer a good book
And you in bed
Hang on (hang on)

Why are we fighting when we should be close
To our wedding
Which would be better than most
We should be in our hearts
Not at our throats
Throats
Hang on (hang on)

Be a good friend tonight
Understand, see it from my side
Be a good friend tonight
One day you will see me in a better light
Now I can feel that you are made with me
Is it justified or imaginary?
Tell me on day how you would like me to be
Living with you is a dangerous flame
You sweep me away and then you drive me insane
Keep your distance
I'm looking for someone to blame
Be a good friend tonight
Understand, see it from my side
Be a good friend tonight
One day you will see me in a better light
In a better light
Hang on
