Crescendo LyricsOh it's late it's late it's late show
Oh it's late it's a late it's a late show
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
Swallowing me
Bow down, bow down with someone
Bow down, bow down with somewhere
It's It's It's better than me
It's It's It's better than me
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
Swallowing me
Bow down, bow down with somewhere
Bow down, bow down with someone
It's It's It's better than me
It's It's It's better than me
Oh, it's a late show
It's it's it's a late show
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me
I'm afraid of loneliness swallowing me

Are you swallowing me?
