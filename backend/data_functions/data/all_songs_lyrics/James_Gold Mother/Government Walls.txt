Government Walls LyricsBreak down the government walls
Speak in tongues, power is money
I see our interest fall well behind their curtain
Break down the government walls
Infiltrate our television
Break down the government walls
Trying to be outspoken
I can hear the sound of falling masonry
As they try to plug that leak
I am tempted by their cloak of secrecy
To find out what their games are about
Ask a question and they'll talk
Of secret services
Secrets from the people they should serve
And they can hide their crimes
In a legal disguise
Truth will not be seen or heard
Break down the government walls
Bring them down within my lifetime
Let's see the curtain drawn
See what they're concealing
Break down the government walls
Secrecy suggests deception
Break down the government walls
Trying to be outspoken
Bring down the government wall
Bring down the government wall
Bring down the government wall
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Break down
Break down
Break down
Break down
Break down
Break down
The government walls!
While in Ireland they may shoot to kill without warning you
Or lock you away for a while without trial
And if an honest cop gets too close to the truth of it
They'll set him up in style
In style
Bring down the government wall
Bring down the government wall
Bring down the government wall
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Bring down
Break down
Break down
Break down
Break down
Break down
Break down
Break down
Break down the government walls!
Break down my government walls
Break down the government walls
Speak in tongues, power is money
I see our interest fall well behind their curtain
Break down the government walls
Infiltrate our television
Break down the government walls
Time to be outspoken
It's a crime to be outspoken
It's a crime to be outspoken
It's a crime
It's a crimeEmbed
