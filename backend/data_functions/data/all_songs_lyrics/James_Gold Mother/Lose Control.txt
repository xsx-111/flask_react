Lose Control Lyrics
Where is the love where is this love
Where is the love that everyone is talking of
Where is the love where is the love
That everyone is dreaming of

Come to bed come to bed
Come to bed I cannot sleep in all this heat
Come to bed come to bed
This terror's all within my head

Don't be deceived, no land in sight
We're all adrift in this dark night
We float on seas of disbelief
While singing songs of pain relief

Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
This body's young but my spirit's old
Scatter my ashes and let these feelings grow

Where is the love where is this love
Where is the love that everyone is talking of
Where is the love where is the love
That everyone is dreaming of
Don't be deceived, no land in sight
We're all adrift in this dark night
We float on seas of disbelief
While singing songs of pain relief

Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
This body's young but my spirit's old
Scatter my ashes and let these feelings grow


Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose control
Shake my body - release my soul
Punish my senses - lose controlEmbed
