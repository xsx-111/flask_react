Doing Time Lyrics
The lives of some men...
If walls could talk to spill the lies, we'd see the world through devil's eyes...

I maintain an addiction
Been known to take it too high
I got an itch with a loaded hair trigger and a one-way ticket to fly

When there's no writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all, everybody's doin' their time

Caught your eye in the corner
Don't you look at me wrong
Fucked up and thrown into the gutter, gotta fix what don't belong

I see the writing on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
After all, everybody's doin' their time
That's just the price to play so tell me what you like
Gotta hand on the kerosene match tonight!
Right...


Had enough of opinions
I got enough on my mind
Sell your soul for approval and a dollar, got a pretty little body to grind

I see your number on the wall
I see the lifeless devils start to crawl
And I don't need no lessons
Watch the fall
You lost my attention
After all, everybody's doin' their time
Time!4Embed
