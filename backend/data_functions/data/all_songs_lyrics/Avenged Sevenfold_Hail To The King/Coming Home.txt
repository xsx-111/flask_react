Coming Home Lyrics
I've been away, searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas, fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies
I've stood in hell, where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes
Walked many roads to witness ancient idols
And found the great gates of fire

Had many storms, question my conviction
Gave armies reason to rise
The hangman's searching, for bones he can borrow
While I escaped in the night, fight or flight

Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home

Escaped the hail of calculated mortars
Then drank the blood of a king
The desert rain has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems
Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home

My story ends, not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is I've been told
So I go

Live again, all roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light, 'cause on this night
I'll be coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home4Embed
