Massacre LyricsAt a point below zero
There's no place left to go
Six hundred unknown heroes
Were killed like sleeping buffalo
Through the Devil's canyon
Across the battlefield
Death has no companion
The spirit is forced to yield
There goes the bandolero
Through the hole in the wall
He's a coward, but he doesn't care though
In fact, he don't care at all
The general that's commanding
He's defending what he fears
While the troops, they are depending
On reinforcements from the rear
If God is in the Heaven
How could this happen here?
In His name, they use the weapon
For the massacre
There's a point below zero
Where the sun, it can see the land
Six hundred unknown heroes
Lie dead in the sandEmbed
