Johnny LyricsSomewhere on the waterfront
Johnny's hiding with a gun
Swears he'll kill any man that tells his story
He ain't sorry for what he's done
He broke into a drugstore
Just to cure a daily need
He didn't mean to shoot the guard
But he was blinded by the greed
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
You see that nun, she's his sister
She doesn't know that he's gone bad
When they told it to his father
It drove the old man mad
Just like his mother warned him
From her dying bed
It's all right to lose your heart
But never lose your head
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Look out
Now the cops have got him surrounded
And he doesn't stand a hope
He wonders how he could be in so much trouble
Over just a little dope
Five to one he gets away
That's the odds I'm going to give
Five to four they blast him away
Three to one he's going to live
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Oh Johnny, you better run
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Back in the alley where he was slain
I thought I heard something move
Beside the trash can lay a heart and chain
The picture had been removed
Just another junkyard juicer
Looking for a bed
It's all right to lose your heart
But never lose your head
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Oh Johnny, oh Johnny
Look out1Embed
