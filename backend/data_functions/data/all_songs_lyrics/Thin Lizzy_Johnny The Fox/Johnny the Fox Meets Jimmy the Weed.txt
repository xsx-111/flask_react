Johnny the Fox Meets Jimmy the Weed LyricsJohnny the Fox
He called to Jimmy the Weed
He said "Hey man, I know your name
I've seen you cruising with the low riders
Hanging out down on First Street and Main"
Tuned into and listening to
The Hoodoo Rhythm Devils
Around the Bay
They got some crazy D.J
Send you right out to Heaven
Jimmy the Weed for greed
He was taken back
Johnny the Fox, you old sly cat
Cleverly the Fox conceals his stash
Crisp dollar bills can leave no tracks
In the back of a black Cadillac
The voodoo music travels
Down Skid Row only black men can go
The shady deal unravels
Johnny the Fox, hot to hustle
Jimmy the Weed won't use no muscle
That cat's so sly, slick and subtle
Johnny the Fox breaks out the bottle
Tuned into and listening to
The voodoo music travels
The beating drum for the lonely one
Send you right out to Heaven
Right out to HeavenEmbed
