Boogie Woogie Dance LyricsIn France they've got a dance
A feel real crazy dance
A touch of class and a dash of romance
To feel that crazy dance
The boogie woogie dance
The boogie woogie dance
In Spain they give it a name
A real chic cheeky name
One you know it you're not the same
But you really take a chance
With the boogie woogie dance
The boogie woogie dance
The boogie woogie dance
The boogie woogie dance
In Brazil they got a pill
A real hard power packed pill
Take one too many you'll feel quite ill
But you really take a chance
Do the boogie woogie dance
The boogie woogie dance
The boogie woogie dance
The boogie woogie dance
Oh dance, hey, do that dance
Oh just fucking danceEmbed
