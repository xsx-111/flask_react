Rocky LyricsCocky Rocky, the rock and roll star
He's got the talent to take him far
Started out playing hotel bars
Cocky Rocky, the rock and roll star
Spent his time just looking for kicks
Whipping out them mean and nasty guitar licks
He knows all the tricks to pull the chicks
Just half a chance and away he rips
Come on, Rocky, take me to the night
The neon streets are shining bright
To all them queens you bring the light
That cocky Rocky, his belt is so tight
Hits the stage, the show begins
Dressed in black to make him thin
The speed they flash, the way he grins
Sail away, Rocky, the note he bends
Come on, Rocky, and throw the dice
You threw it once, now throw it twice
Heavy boys, they want a slice
They paid their money, they want the choice
Cocky Rocky, he's a rock and roll star
He's got the talent to take him far
And all he needs is that old guitar
Cocky Rocky, the rock and roll starEmbed
