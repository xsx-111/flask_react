Borderline LyricsIt's midnight in the big city
At the bar drinking all on my own
Just thinking about that girl and me
How something's going wrong
Mister, tell me
What's my saving grace?
The back room boys were all telling me
I'm a borderline case
Back on the borderline
One more time
Back on the borderline
One more time
Seven beers and still sober
It's time to change to something stronger
I cannot take this scene no longer
She could have told me it's all over
Back in my home town
The old place it's still the same
But time can cast a spell over something
You can't go back again
Back on the borderline
One more time
Back on the borderline
One more time
Mister, fill me another
Till I go crazy and it turn my mind around
Just pass that bottle one more time
And slowly sink it down
Jeanie, can I tell you
The shame of my disgrace?
It's just love or rejection
For this borderline case
Back on the borderline
One more time
Back on the borderline
One more time
I'm on my hands and knees, I'm crawling
I'm begging you, darling
One more time
I know the risk you're taking
But please don't leave me forsaken
One more timeEmbed
