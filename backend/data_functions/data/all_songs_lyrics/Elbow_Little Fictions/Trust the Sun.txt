Trust the Sun Lyrics
I just don’t trust the sun to rise
When I can’t see your eyes
You’re my reason for breathing

The napkin inks the words away
My numb dismay is deafening
I forget to blink
And I used to love a bar full of flickering stars
Far from home

But I’m pressing down an anger in my bones
Though if he came within swinging distance sonny Jim
I would still go for the hold
It’s cold in Chicago

I just don’t trust the sun to rise
When I can’t see your eyes
You’re my reason for breathing

Archipelago go gone
We pushed the boat out far too far this time
Something we dared never dream on TV every day
Eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye
Can I register today I refuse to be afraid
There’s a girl a world away who sees love in other people
I just don’t trust the sun to rise
When I can’t see your eyes
You’re my reason for breathing
I just don’t trust the world to spin
If I can’t pull you in
You’re my reason for breathingEmbed
