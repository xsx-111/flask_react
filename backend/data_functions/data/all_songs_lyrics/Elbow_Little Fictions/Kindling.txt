Kindling Lyrics
Had a circular saw blade
Where I should have had a heart
I was trusted, I adored her
And I tore it all apart

Twin moons on a millpond
From a tumbledown barn
I can still taste the heat of the sun on her skin in my arms

I could fold to the cold of these
January streets
But your smile in the half-light was
Pure pillow print cheek
I will be far away for a while
But my heart’s staying put
Warming and guarding and guiding
The one that I love
Warming and guarding and guiding
The one that I love

The silence and the waiting and the rush of all aboard
Fifty souls to a carriage I’m trying hard to be ignored
Then my telephone shakes into life and I see your name
And the wheat fields explode into gold either side of the train
And the wheat fields explode into gold either side of the train
And the wheat fields explode into goldEmbed
