Gentle Storm Lyrics
I will fly swift and true straight to you, like an arrow
Just to be where you lie
Meet my quest, do my shambling best to be near you
Where you lie
I've found peace in your arms

Gentle storm
Rage my way
Fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Everyday

Counting down, now the clocks reset when I met you
Do we start a new line?
Yours and my spit-shone restless hearts, they were meant to
Beat one time, share one fate
From this day

Gentle storm
Rage away
And fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
Fall in love with me
EverydayEmbed
