Firebrand & Angel Lyrics
North Star
Rolling round the heavens and watching me pine
The whole night through
When we were together the terror sublime
Would turn me blue
When you’re in her mirror you don’t even know
Your own green eyes
Fella interstellar, I’m broken in two
And I blame you

North star giz a little sprinkle of heavenly dust
I just need sane
Wishing on you got me a hatful of rain
And three lost years
When you’re in her mirror you don’t even feel
The tears that fall
Fella interstellar, I’m miles from home
The blame is yours
Blame you, blame you

Hey there
Woke up on a curbstone as high as a sofa
Dopey and hopeless
Hey there
Show me to the corner of firebrand and angel
Open a place and I’ll
Stay there
One day in a whirlwind she’ll call for a late one
Stay for a lifetime
Meantime
My best friend never-ending forgets all my stories
And lies of my glories
Hey there
Woke up on a curbstone as high as a sofa
Dopey and hopeless
Hey there
Show me to the corner of firebrand and angel
Open a place and I’ll
Stay there
One day in a whirlwind she’ll call for a late one
Stay for a lifetime
Meantime
My best friend never-ending forgets all my stories
And lies of my glories
Hey there
Woke up on a curbstone as high as a sofa
Dopey and hopeless
Hey there
Show me to the corner of firebrand and angel
Open a place and I’ll
Stay there
One day in a whirlwind she’ll call for a late one
Stay for a lifetime
Meantime
My best friend never-ending forgets all my stories
And lies of my glories
Hey there
Woke up on a curbstone as high as a sofa
Dopey and hopeless
Hey there
Show me to the corner of firebrand and angel
Open a place and I’ll
Stay there
One day in a whirlwind she’ll call for a late one
Stay for a lifetime
Meantime
My best friend never-ending forgets all my stories
And lies of my glories
So thenEmbed
