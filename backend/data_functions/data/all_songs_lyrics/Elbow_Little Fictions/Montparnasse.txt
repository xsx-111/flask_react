Montparnasse Lyrics
Hurt and baffled, I simmer and freeze
I’m squeezing my words like I’m icing a bomb
Blame me if it gets you to sleep
But mind how you go as you get ‘til you’re gone

Your heart could easy power three of me
Should my love get lost in the delivery

May brings a super moon gold and relentless
And the dog bats of Melbourne fall from the blue
Swerving casinos and swatting at memories of you

Don’t talk like we were stuck in a lift
Why would I be missing you so violently
We’re all the hero when directing the scene
But therapy for liars is a giant ice cream

Your heart could easy power three of me
Should my love get lost in the delivery

The lights on your father’s bridge on the harbour
Montparnasse dawn for the sleepless insane
Caught in our personal rain again and again
Serious love for the longest of lives
Not a regret when these mumbles are through
Gatecrashing weddings and swatting at memories of youEmbed
