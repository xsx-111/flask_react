All Disco Lyrics
Who am I to tell you to care less
Wish I'd have met you never forget you

Young man with your bruised old soul
One snap to bring you back
Hands black with smudging the night into day
There's lemon and thyme in the alley you could slip away
But there are still fences to squeeze through
And I'll meet you
Spirits decanted

Come to the river son
Let your obsession go
What does it prove if you die for a tune
It's really all disco
Everything

Let's join the yellow eyed snug-flies
Rejoicing in choices they made
Let's be the burned
Laughing at not having learned
Let's be a hundred and five you and I
And sing out a tune of regrets and the moon
Perverted old-timers
I'll feed you one-liners
Come to the river son
Let the obsession go
What does it prove if you die for a tune
It's really all disco
Everything
What does it prove if you die for a tune
Don't you know it's all disco
Everything

I can hear how deep you're going
Pull the cord
I can feel your tempo slowing
Pull the cord3Embed
