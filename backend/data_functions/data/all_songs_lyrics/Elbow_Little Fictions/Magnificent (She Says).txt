Magnificent (She Says) Lyrics
This is where, this is where the bottle lands
Where all the biggest questions meet
With little feet stood in the sand
This is where the echoes swell to nothing on the tide
And where a tiny pair of hands
Finds a sea-worn piece of glass
And sets it as a sapphire in her mind

And there she stands
Throwing both her arms around the world
The world that doesn't even know
How much it needs this little girl

It's all gonna be magnificent, she says
It's all gonna be magnificent

This is where it all began
To light your mother's cigarette
Meant I got to touch her hand
And my heart, there defrosting in a gaze
Wasn't built to beat that way
Suddenly I understand
There on the sand
Throwing both her arms around the world
The world that doesn't even know
How much it needs this little girl

It's all gonna be magnificent, she says
It's all gonna be magnificent
It's all gonna be magnificent, she says
It's all gonna be magnificent

The echoes slow, the bottle lands
The echoes slow, and there she stands5Embed
