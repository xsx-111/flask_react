Mikey Rocks Lyrics
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy
Let 'em know who it is

I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I—I—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I, I—I—I—I, I—I—I rock

Hold the phone, like a call on the other line
I'm on the phone with a bone of another kind (Hello?)
So hold on, we could roll to the other side
The side of my dome is a zone you could never find (Ugh)
Grip hand, you might need assistance
Trying to find where you are inside of my head
Stay in line, single-file if you can
Then, we can kick it like kickstands
And, you know I pedal til the chain slip (Yeah)
So fly, propellers propel us to the angels (Yeah)
Repelling the fellas that's jealous of the name, it's (Yeah)
Repellant to rappers as soon as I stage hit (Ugh)
So one-two, one-two, mic check
I'm out for the high end, EQ my steps
I don't use bad grammar, so please, excuse this
I'm just trying to let niggas know who I is (Word)
I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going (Right...)
I—I—I—I—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going (Right...)
I—I—I—I—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going (Right...)
I—I—I—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock
I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going (Right...)
I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going (Right...)
I—I—I—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock

Mission complete, for all those who don't know
Sayonora to afros and old flows (Peace)
The concept of rocking shows is so old
Just keep them off the wall like Vans logos
Pull it together, the spare change and hobos
'Cause if you got change in your pocket
Then, instantly, the dames start flocking
And if you show me to the stage (I—I—I rock)... it
Yes, that's on request (Yeah)
All I need is a mic and In-gl-ish (Ugh)
Drop the beat, all right, I proceed to spit (Yeah)
Me and the beat start fighting with the snares and kicks
Now, it's a riot on the track
Reason why is 'cause I'm fire, and I'm hired to do that
And I'm fire 'cause I'm liver then the wire that was tired
Brought back from the dead, let it rest on your head
If you don't know who he is, it's...
I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I—I—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I, I—I—I—I, I—I—I rock
I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going (Right...)
I—I—I—I—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going (Right...)
I—I—I—I—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going (Right...)
I—I—I—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock
I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock
I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going
I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I'm going
I—I—I—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock, I'm—I'm


I'm—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I—I—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I—I'm—I'm Mikey, I—I—I rock (Right...)
I—I—I, I—I—I—I, I—I—I rock1Embed
