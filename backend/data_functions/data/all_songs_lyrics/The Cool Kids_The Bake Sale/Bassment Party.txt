Bassment Party Lyrics
They say if you ain't got no money take yo broke ass home
I say if you got you two dollars, then come through to my party
But get bent before you come cause for that liquor I'll be charging
And take down these directions
It's right past that intersection
Make a right at the light
It's the first house on the left
And get it, got it, good
You made it, I knew you would
We got them drinks up in the back and them chic-key's looking good
Hold up, here come one, ayy what's yo name hun?
Jackie brown, yea that pop
Ayy I'm chuck, this mikey rocks
And let me introduce you to some kids that you ain't used to
Yep we def and we ride bikes
Herringbones and jordan 5's
Got every single color
So, just in case you wonder
My parties is always live as a mother is for supper
In the summer
When it's hotter then a oven
We the coolest kids we know
So you know we into something
That involve doing something
With a trunk to get that bass drum pumpin'
It's my party, so get up
If you don't you gettin' jumped
What's happening?
Hey, where's the party?
Say you heard me say that there's a party
Right around my way
So if you finna start it
Then don't do nothing small
Get everyone involved
And say that it's a party

One to the two
Three to the four
Chuckey and mike is at yo door
We don't knock, we straight on that
"When yo album drop?"
You could wait on that
I don't don't like the questions you ask so
Let me tell you a little about myself
Everywhere I go I act a ass
And if you ain't know, better go and ask
At every party
I hop the bar
And then dance with the chicks on top of that
Bartender be like, "get off of that!"
I'm like "not till I get rich off of rap"
Then I look to the left, she dipping her hips
And licking her lips
At me I guess
Then I look to the left, look to the right
Point to my chest she was like, "that's right"
Now let me tell you the recipe
To all you niggas tryna get like me
It takes a scoop of being cool
And the rest will be included
When you purchase my movie
Cause if you knew what I knew
You would prolly try to
Do whatever I do
Prolly move to chicago
If you want instructions
Then I could prolly front them
Just as long as you shortys pay attention
So if you ugly keep yo hands by yo side
But if you not then put 'em in the sky
And if you knowin' what it is
It's a party at the crib
Come and party with the kids, like
