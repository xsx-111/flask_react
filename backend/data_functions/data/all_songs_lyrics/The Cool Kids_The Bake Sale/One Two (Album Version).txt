One Two (Album Version) Lyrics
One, two, lace up my shoes
Three to the four when I stepped out the door
Five, six, kick a little something with The Cool Kids
Then we do it again
One, two, lace up my shoes
Three to the four when I stepped out the door
Five, six, kick a little something with The Cool Kids
Then we do it again

What it is, what it is, come check the noise
It's the new black version of the Beastie Boys
Chuck-Ie, Mikey, some dudes don't like me
Don't care, I'm dope, they lame so bite me
Find a rock to kick or a bridge to jump off
I'm popular and you not (yes sir)
I'm on the "Dyno with the Black Mags"
Smooth as the vinyl in the black bag
Stumble like the wino with the brown bag
In his right hand around town again
I'm keeping cool like it's going out of style
Sticking to the program, kicking it with no hands (kicking)
That's what I do, been doing it for a while
Homie, not a wack thread on me
Size 10 Jedis, Obi-Wan Kenobi
And I'm Anakin and I'm rambling
So bladabladabla till the chorus end
One, two, lace up my shoes
Three to the four when I stepped out the door
Five, six, kick a little something with The Cool Kids
Then we do it again
It goes; one, two, lace up my shoes
Three to the four when I stepped out the door
Five, six, kick a little something with The Cool Kids
Then we do it again

Chuck was dopeâ€”but chuck is cold
As a ice cream cone in a Iceland snowstorm
Feeling like a ceiling fan blowing out the window
Midway city is the city where wind blows
Fairly cold, frigerator Perry with a little bit of gold
'85 bears jersey, Infrared Spike Lee Jordan number fours
Bow for a second then I pause for applause
Check it out, if it's froze let it thaw
Let it rain clear it out, that's the proper protocol
When I steps on the court with the ball on the floor
You dribbling around just being a ball hog
I got my kicks out my locker
If I ain't got the shot then I dish to my partner
Step behind the arc, I cross, I Byron Scott-er
If you want it I got it, dripping like water
One, two, lace up my shoes
Three to the four when I stepped out the door
Five, six, kick a little something with The Cool Kids
Then we do it again
One, two, lace up my shoes
Three to the four when I stepped out the door
Five, six, kick a little something with The Cool Kids
Then we do it againEmbed
