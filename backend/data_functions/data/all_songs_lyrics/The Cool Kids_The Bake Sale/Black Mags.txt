Black Mags Lyrics
"Pedal down the foot hills, wheelies on the front"
"P-P-Pedal down the foot hills, wheelies on the front"

I got this '89-'90, Pistons champ flat
Bill black Starter cap wit the hologram tags
White Mag rims, red rubber tires
Chain, frame, pegs, grips shipped from my supplier
Dopeman attire, gimme 'bout an hour
And I'll have it clickin, tickin, glidin, flyin like McGuyver
I'm a Murder Club dope pedal rider
Nigel said I'm good to get that ink on my bicep
I gets busy as a bee on my bike grips
If I cat-walk this sidewalk, I could fly this
Bitch and I'm fly, and it's tied to the side
That's the flag that I'm flyin, add to the fact
That it all coincides with these wheels that I'm ridin
Three point Mags make you think that I'm glidin
Shit, nigga I ain't lyin'
I got a long rap sheet that'll say that I'm tied in

"Pedal down the foot hills, wheelies on the front" (yep, uh)
"P-P-Pedal down the foot hills, wheelies on the front" (yep)
"I'm on the Dyno wit the black mag, black mag" (word?)
"Dyno wit the black mag, black mag, black mag, Dyno wit the.." (word?)
I hit Chuck on the pager, "Yo, I'm kinda bored
Ain't got class til later so, open garage"
And I don't really know which way to go
I ain't trying skate it though
And my bike's illegal, so they send for the law
But I don't care Joe (nah), I just keep on pedaling
Ride past shorty light-skinned with no melanin
Shirt look like somebody stuffed two melons in
Had to stop, so I could preach like Reverend
I grip on the handbrake and say, "Waddup?"
I skip on the handshakes, I'm straight, what else?
I got two pegs on the back
And you got two legs under your skirt - so hop, we head
To the Dope Pedal Headquarters (c'mon)
You would be there if you could
Chuck got the red wheels and the white mags, but it's all good
Got the gold hunnid spokes like "Boyz N the Hood,"
With the lime green frame (uh), dollars on the bike seat
Handlebar grips is the same as my Nikes
And the mode of gold I use for my spokes
And the frame is the same as I use for my chain - out!

"Pedal down the foot hills, wheelies on the front" (yep, uh)
"P-P-Pedal down the foot hills, wheelies on the front" (yep)
"I'm on the Dyno wit the black mag, black mag" (word?)
"Dyno wit the black mag, black mag, black mag, Dyno wit the.." (word?)2Embed
