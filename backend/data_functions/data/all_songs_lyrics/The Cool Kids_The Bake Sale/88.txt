88 Lyrics
Break it
Bop it
Niggas beat-boxing

I do what I do like I do it for TV
I guess what I'm doin' I'm doin' to keep the...
Shoes on my feet sweeter than sweet peas
So you sucker MCs really can't out-step me
I grab a mic I rock it from 9-5
Self-employed, kicking back is my hobby and job
E-Z Rock beats with bass, ladies calling me Rob
Base, Base, Base, Base
I'm on my '88 shit
Cuban link chains and Cazal frame lense
Guess Jeans, stone-washed
Rocking top 10 kicks
Flicking on my fit
I got my foot looking like a '88 draft pick
It's that sick, it gets sicker than the flu
And sir, you came to pretend I'm the shit
Attain you a class on how to be cooler
In fact, I'm the superintendent of the school
Uh, yeah and I'm back on my job
I press and twist knobs
Just to make your head nod
All you wack rappers need to keep your day job
And my work here is done, I'm a take the day off
Do the smurf, Do the wop, Baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringing '88 back
Do the smurf, Do the wop, Baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringing '88 back
(Smurf it, Wop it, at the bus stop and)
(Break it, Bop it, Niggas beat-boxing)
Do the smurf, Do the wop, Baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringing '88 back
(Smurf it, Wop it, at the bus stop and)
(Break it, Bop it, Niggas beat-boxing)
Do the smurf, Do the wop, Baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringing '88 back

We know who this be, it's me, no secrets
Stuck to the beat and glued to the sequence
Igloo freezing we is
You can catch us walking on the weekend
While you awkwardly breathing
From all the second hand smoke
Nigga, you a square
Lit you at the tip, blow it in the air
We don't play fair
And that's a fact
Separating people from the squares
Like a nicotine patch
Lookie here, quite honestly
You're gonna have to pardon me
I'm a modern day fly machine
Yes sir, that's absurd
But the best word to describe would be "ah"
Piffed, mad as me
Which hand is free?
Shake the one that is and I gotta handle my biz
Until I got the aching ribs
Salute to all them scally-wags and fresh kids, yes

We can dance if you wanna
We can leave your friends behind
Cause if your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Then they ain't no friends of mine
Yo, it just hit me that
I'm the fresh prince
And that means I'm Will
And I chill with the chicks in the back
On the real, it might feel like a kick in the back
From gorillas, but chill that's the skill that I pack
Yes sonny, you need to rock while I do the wop
Old schoolers bop cooler while we moving through the spot
Cruising through the roof
'88 frames on Adidas track suit
Ask who? Be quiet when the game's on
Cause I'm in championship
And I moving through time in my champion ship
We cannot fall
So I'm leaving you with these three words:
Yes, yes ya'll

Smurf it, Wop it, at the bus stop and
Break it, Bop it, Niggas beat-boxing
Smurf it, Wop it, at the bus stop and
Break it, Bop it, Niggas beat-boxing1Embed
