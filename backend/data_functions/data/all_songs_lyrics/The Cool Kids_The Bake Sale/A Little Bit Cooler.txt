A Little Bit Cooler Lyrics
So I'm sitting on the couch, holding the remote
Flippin channels, I'm a rebel
Eating a bowl of them Fruity Pebbles
Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles (yeah)
How gangsta is that? (huh?) Not gangsta at all
Aww you judging me dog? Please! You shop at the mall
Me? I shop at boutiques, limited quantity sneaks
Where do these quantities be?
Maybe they all on my feet (I don't know)
But I don't get it though, about a year ago
You said my gear was wack, nigga now my gear is dope?
I guess it goes full circle like a Cheerio
Cause you rockin what I was rockin like a year ago
You said my chain was lame, then you go and get a rope?
You clown jokesters pose for poser posters
Told you when I woke up, hold it like holsters
And stop (stop!) while I fold the rest of my clothes up
I love that hypocrites hatin until you make it
Wack swagger-jackers, but my steez ain't for the takin

Nigga you still playin Sega? - (I'm cooler than that guy)
The red monkeys with the BAPEsters - (I'm cooler than that guy)
What you ridin on that bike for? - (I'm cooler than that guy)
Does that belt say Star Wars? - (I'm cooler than that guy)
Why your jeans ain't saggin? - (I'm cooler than that guy)
You ain't smokin on the 'dro cuz? - (I'm cooler than that guy)
Where your stunner shades at dog? - (I'm cooler than that guy)
Man y'all niggas ain't got no buzz - (I'm cooler than those guys)
I'm in the crib, Saturday night, with my Sega, that's right
Playing a game of that Street Fighter, Street Fighter, Street Fighter
I guess that makes you think you cooler than me (what)
But any girl you could pull, I could pull em with ease
Like the letter after D, not ecstasy
It's easy to me, yes yes indeed
It's hard to believe but swallow it
So much game that I could put it in a bottle and sell it to lames
And gettin graphics in your fade was fresh in the day
But it was jacked by the losers, I'm bout to say screw it
And grow a gheri curl, wear a diaper like Cupid
Or something else stupid and see if people do it (c'mon man)
If they do then that proves it, people are just losers
And they'll do anything if someone cool do it
But they won't do it first (nah) so I guess they not cool (nope)
This the end of the verse, so I'm chuckin' that deuce
