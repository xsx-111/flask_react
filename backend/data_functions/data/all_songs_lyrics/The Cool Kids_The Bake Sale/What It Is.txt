What It Is LyricsYo Mike!
Mikey Rocks:
What it is yo?
I'm just chillin like a villain, grindin' daily
Cause I can't get a nine-to-five So I rhyme
I rock ya dig Ya know it's cool
I'll take you to school that's what I do
Yo Chuck
Chuck Inglish:
I... I... I rock
If you don't think so nigga kick rocks
We the time on clocks
The boom on box
You like us homie that's hogwash
Boombox on my shoulder
And she...
Started walking over
Like yo...
Looked me up and down
And if looks could kill then she'd be in jail
Mikey Rocks:
Well I hope you got the keys, she got me as well
But I wanna let her out cause she is ill Ummm...
But I get iller
Freeze!
Now take my picture
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)

Chuck Inglish:
I drive a 5.0 GT that is
Drop-top roof with the Dayton's on the wheels
Got bass in the back, back to the front
I can hit a switch and make the trunk lift up
Mikey Rocks:
Let me hop in it - let me lace my kicks
Then flip the Sidekick peep my options (yeah)
Go down the list like "hmmm not that one"
Maybe her tomorrow but that's after
I find out just what she's after
If it's dough then she gotta get gon'
She'll never get a call like broken phones
Chuck Inglish:
And I suppose that she gonna call me
I'll take her and her, I'll take all three
But the truck that I'm in's only got two seats
And I'm in one so you know what that means
Mikey Rocks:
That means it's decision time
Hop in the women line
If it's nine, taking 7Up like lemon-lime
To the penthouse, so there's two left for you Chuck
(I ain't got no penthouse)
We party on the rooftop
Brand new blazers that came from Malaysia
Grab the turntable and smack the DJ up
If he don't play us, we rockin to the A.M
So you niggas better wake up
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
Yeah! (come on) Yup! (come on)
