Winterlong Lyrics
I waited for you, Winterlong
You seem to be where I belong
It's all illusion anyway

If things should ever turn out wrong
And all the love we have is gone
It won't be easy on that day

Waiting to follow
Through the dreamlight of your way
Is not so easy for me now

Half the time has passed away (Sha-la-la-la)
Things we thought of yesterday (Sha-la-la-la)
Come back now, come back now, wow-ow

Waiting to follow
Through the dreamlight of your way
Is not so easy for me now

Half the time has passed away (Sha-la-la-la)
Things we thought of yesterday (Sha-la-la-la)
Come back now, come back now, wow-ow
I waited for you Winterlong
You seem to be where I belongEmbed
