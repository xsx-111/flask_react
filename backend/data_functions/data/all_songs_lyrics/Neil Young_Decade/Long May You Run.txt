Long May You Run Lyrics
We've been through
Some things together
With trunks of memories
Still to come
We found things to do
In stormy weather
Long may you run

Long may you run
Long may you run
Although these changes
Have come
With your chrome heart shining
In the sun
Long may you run

Well, it was
Back in Blind River in 1962
When I last saw you alive
But we missed that shift
On the long decline
Long may you run

Maybe The Beach Boys
Have got you now
With those waves
Singing "Caroline No"
Rolling down
That empty ocean road
Getting to the surf on time
