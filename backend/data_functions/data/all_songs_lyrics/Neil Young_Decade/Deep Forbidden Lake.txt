Deep Forbidden Lake LyricsOn the lake, the deep forbidden lake
The old boats go gliding by
And the leaves are falling from the trees
And landing on the logs and I
See the turtles heading for the bog
And falling off the log
They make the water splash and feeling no backlash
They climb the happy banks
On the boats, the old and creaky boats
The shoreline goes gliding by
And the wind that was a dying breeze
Is making the banners fly
See the colors floating on the sky
The pride of the captain's eye
As he glides his slender craft inside
And opens up the door
On the coast, the long and tempting coast
The cards on the table lie
And a speech so eloquent in reach
Was made by a passerby
Passing by the way between here and left behind
And it ripples through the crowds
Who run and cast their doubts
In the deep forbidden lake
Yes, it echoes through the crowds
Who run and cast their doubts
In the deep forbidden lakeEmbed
