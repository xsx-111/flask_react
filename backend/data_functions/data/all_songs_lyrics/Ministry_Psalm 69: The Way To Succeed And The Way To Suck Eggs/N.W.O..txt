N.W.O. Lyrics
"It's alright! It's alright!"
"It's alright! It's alright!"
I'm in love without the tears of regret
Open fire cos I love it to death
Sky high, with a heartache of stone
You'll never see me cos I'm always alone
How to love without a trace of dissent
I'll buy the toys if you can pay for the rent
Flying high with the public in hand
I'm in love with the promised land
I'm in love with a malicious intent
You've been taken but you don't know it yet
A truer love has never yet to be found
I see the sunset through the eyes of a clown

"It's alright! It's alright!"
What we are looking at
Is good and evil, right and wrong
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
We're not about to make that same mistake twice
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order
A new world order3Embed
