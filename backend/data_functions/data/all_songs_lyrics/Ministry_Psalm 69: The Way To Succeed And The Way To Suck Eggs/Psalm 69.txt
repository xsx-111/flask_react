Psalm 69 Lyrics
"Congregation, please be seated, and open your prayer guides to the Book of Revelations, Psalm 69
69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69, 69
"I feel like my heart has been touched by Christ"
"I feel like my heart has been touched by Christ"
"I feel like my heart has been touched by Christ"
"I feel like my heart has been touched by Christ"
"Liar! Blasphemer!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"Liar! Blasphemer!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"And now it's time for us to give a little love back to God"

Drinking the blood of Jesus
Drinking it right from his veins
Learning to swim in the ocean
Learning to prowl in His name
The body of Christ looked unto me
A preacher with cock in his hand
He wants you to suck off the Holy Ghost
And swallow the sins of man

"Hallelujah! In the name of Jesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen!"
"Hallelujah! In the name of Jesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen!"
Psalm 69
"Praise the Lord!"
"I feel like my heart has been touched by Christ"
"I feel like my heart has been touched by Christ"
"Liar! Blasphemer!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"Liar! Blasphemer!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"Praise Jesus!"
"Praise Jesus!"

The invisible piss of the Holy Ghost
Comes down like acid rain
They're making a profit off terminal guilt
The scavengers go on parade
The fathers who write that eternity
Is used to fight the sword
Have filled you up with the Devil's cock
And he'll cum in the name of the Lord

"Hallelujah! In the name of Jesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen!"
"Hallelujah! In the name of Jesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Amen!"
"Liar!"
"Liar!"
"Liar!"
"Liar!"
"God damn preacher"
The way to succeed and the way to suck eggs
"Stop it!"Embed
