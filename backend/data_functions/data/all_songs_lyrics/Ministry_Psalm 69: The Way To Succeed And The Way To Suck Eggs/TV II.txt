TV II Lyrics
Tell me something I don't know
Show me something I can't use
Push the button
Connect the goddamned dots

Live-in thief in my bedroom bathroom
Commodity sodomy, glass arch enemy
Promise everything, take it all away
Give it a rest
You're lying through your teeth
You're lying through your teeth

Who, what, which, why, who
When did you say the earth would stop turning?
When did you say we would all start burning?
When should I make a pledge?
Should I listen to the voices in my head?

Connect the goddamned dots
Connect the goddamned dots
Connect the goddamned dots
Who am I trying to impress?
Who could care less?
Tell me something I don't knowEmbed
