Hero Lyrics
They get you ready to fight
The fuse is ready to blow
You shoot to kill on sight
They call you G.I Joe
You never wanted to stop
The smell of burning flesh
The hero marches alone
Across the highway of death

Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Hero!
Hero!
Hero!
Hero!

It's not a matter of rights
It's just a matter of war
Don't have a reason to fight
They never had one before
You're just a killing machine
He's come to take you down
We take the gas that we need
And pump the blood on the ground
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Hero!
Hero!
Hero!
Hero!

They're gonna set you up
So they can take you down
They're gonna suck you dry
They've left the blood to be found
They're gonna rip you apart
You're gonna burn at the stake
'Cause when it's time to collect
It's only heroes who pay

Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Hero!
