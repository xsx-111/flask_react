Sugar Moon Lyrics** When it's sugarcane time
And around about June
I'll be walkin' with my sugar
'Neath that old sugar moon
All the lovin' I missed
I'll be gettin' it soon
I'll be gettin' it from my sugar
'Neath that old sugar moon
* I can see us right now
Get the calendar down
(And) Draw a circle around
The day we're heaven bound
When it's sugarcane time
And around about June
All the birds will be singin'
'Neath that old sugar moon
(repeat*)
