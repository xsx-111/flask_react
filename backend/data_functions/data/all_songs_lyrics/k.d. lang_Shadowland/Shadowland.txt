Shadowland LyricsI'm a shadow since you're gone
Just a shadow in the dawn
That breaks in the sand
A shadow lost in shadowland
My poor heart just flew away
When it realized one day
The dreams that we planned
Would only end in shadowland
I always wondered
Why you had to go
Whatever blunder I made
I don't know
I guess that something
Turned out wrong
Didn't quite belong
In this lover's song
I'm a shadow, but you know
I'm the one who loves you so
So please, take my hand
And lead me out of shadowland
And lead me out of shadowlandEmbed
