(Waltz Me) Once Again Around the Dance Floor LyricsWaltz me once again
'Round that dance floor
Make my head go spinnin' 'round
Dance me over by that bandstand
'Cause I love that twin fiddle sound
When we're dancin' close
Cheek to cheek
My head gets woozy
And my knees get weak
Waltz me once again
'Round that dance floor
Make my head go spinnin' 'round
It's Friday night
And the joint is swingin'
Inside these swingin' doors
And all the cowpokes they're a dancin'
And slippin' 'round this sawdust floor
But you better watch out
Who you let cut in
'Cause you might loose your baby
To your best friend
Well, waltz me once again
'Round that dance floor
Make my head go spinnin' 'round
We spin around, 'round and 'round
Dancin' all night long
The music stopped at three o'clock
But some fool turned that jukebox on
Waltz me once again
'Round the dance floor We'll dance all night longEmbed
