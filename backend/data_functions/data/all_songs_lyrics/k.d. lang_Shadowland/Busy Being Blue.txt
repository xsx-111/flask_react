Busy Being Blue Lyrics
I'd have time on my hands
Time to make some plans
Time to take a different point of view
Time to take a walk
And time to sit and talk
But you know I'm too busy bein' blue
I'd have time to fool around
Time to paint the town
Time to spend each night
With someone new
Time to be alone
And time to stay out all night long
But you know I'm too busy bein' blue
I'd have time to leave behind
For to you and all your kind
Time to leave behind the world we knew
But I'm still occupied
Just rememberin' how we cried
But you know I'm too busy bein' blue

I'd have time on my hands
Time to make some plans
Time to take a different point of view
Time to take a walk
And time to sit and talk
But you know I'm too busy bein' blueEmbed
