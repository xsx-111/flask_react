Western Stars LyricsWestern stars light up the sky
Hear the desert wind roll by
Tonight, tonight
Western stars can break your heart
They keep shinin' when we're apart
Tonight, tonight
I watch, I wait
How long will my heart ache
Tonight, oh tonight
I watch, I wait
My heart is bound to break
Tonight
Western stars light up the sky
Tonight I'm alone to cry
Tonight
I watch, I wait
My heart is bound to break
Tonight
(repeat*)
Tonight, tonightEmbed
