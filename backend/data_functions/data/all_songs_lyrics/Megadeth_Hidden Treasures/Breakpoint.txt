Breakpoint Lyrics

Make the rules for me to live by
Rules you break and just let it slide
You try to find you inside of me
Be as great as you want me to be
Hypocrite, the word that fits
Do as you say, not as you do

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint

Self-esteem you seem to lack
Point the finger, three pointing back
Control's the illusion with all good intent
Evil is contagious, you laugh and infect
Criticist, the word that fits
Put me down to lift you up

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
Pushing me, push, push me to a breakpoint
Watching pain, your only pleasure
Fascination for sick disaster
Suffering since you were born
Mess with the bull, you'll get the horn
Misery, the word that fits
Times are good when times are bad

You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me to a breakpoint
You're pushing me, pushing me to a breakpoint

"In my opinion as a professional, I recommend we straitjacket the son of a bitch, lock him in a rubber room, sedate him heavily, and when he wakes up, if he wakes up, we'll see if he can be a nice boy."
"Sedate me? Ha, cool. A straitjacket? Hey, hey, let go of me, hey *struggling*."

Breakpoint, you've pushed me to a breakpoint
Breakpoint, you've pushed me to a breakpoint
Breakpoint, don't push me1Embed
