Problems Lyrics
Too many problems, oh why am I here
I need to be me, because you're all to clear
And I can see there's something wrong with you
Oh, what do you expect me to do?
At least I got to know what I want to be
Don't come to me if you need pity
Are you lonely, you got no-one
You got your body in suspension

That's a problem, problem, problem
The problem is you

Eat your heart out on a plastic tray
You don't do what you want and you fade away
You work for me, you're working nine-to-five
It's too much fun of being alive
I'm using my feet for my human machine
You work for me, living for the screen
Are you get lonely, all needs catered
You got your brains dehydrated

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Oh what, what you going to do, problem, problem

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
Well, what you going to do with your problem
The problem is you, problem

I'm not death trip, but I'm not automatic
You work for me, just stay ecstatic
Don't you give me any orders
To people like me, there is no order
Bet you thought you had it all worked out
Bet you thought you knew what I was about
Bet you thought you'd solved all your problems
But you are the problem

Problem, problem, problem, the problem is you
What you going to do with your problem
I'll leave it to you
Problem, the problem is you
You got a problem
What you gonna do?

They know a doctor, gonna take you away
Thay take you away and they throw away the key
They don't want you and they don't want me
You got a problem, the problem is you
Problem, what you gonna do?
Problem, oh, you got a problem
Problem, you got a problem
Problem, problem
Problem, problem, problem, problem
Problem, problem, problem, problem
Problem, problem, problemEmbed
