Diadems Lyrics
Sacrilege and blasphemy set the stage today
The more insatiable the sex
The more swelled our tongues became
As prehistoric as it seems this is now, today
As prehistoric as it seems this is now

Talking about no vision, talking about no dream
The harlot puddles for her lies
From where she speaks
I look above and see entrails in the sky
This one isn't over until the fat lady dies


One man rules the earth
And rides a seven-headed beast
Ten diadems to crown them all
The world religion at his feet
Dreams are told of dreams of old
This day will surely come
So run my child and hide your face
Once you've been marked you're finished, done
You'll become one, you're mine, you're one
I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away
I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass away

Vengeance is mine, vengeance is mine
The Netherworld and Sheol are never satisfied
So the eyes of man are never satisfied
I saw a new earth today
I saw a former pass awayEmbed
