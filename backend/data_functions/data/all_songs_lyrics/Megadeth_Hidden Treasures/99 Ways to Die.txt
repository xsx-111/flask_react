99 Ways to Die Lyrics
If I see the morning hours
I'll have one more yesterday
Take life from tomorrow
Because I've burned out my today
If I get up to the top I know
I'll just go back downhill
I've got a terminal future
And it's time to write my will

I downed another glass of courage
And a shot of Thorazine

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet

Got a short between the earphones
Wringing my hands in dismay
A more efficient maniac
With two feet in the grave
I've got no last words to say
Yellow streak right up my spine
The gun in my mouth was real
And the taste blew my mind
In a black tie and straightjacket
Man, I'm going to try again

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet


Demitasse of arsenic
Try on this tie
Nevermind the tree

There is only death and danger
In the sockets of my eyes
A playground of illusion
No one plays, they only die
There's a prison in my mind
And the bars are gonna break
I'm as mad as a hatter
And strung out just the same
Taunting rigor mortis
I feel it draw me in

We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
We're not ready to see you yet
99 ways to die
We're not ready to see you yet
We're not ready
We're not ready
We're not ready
