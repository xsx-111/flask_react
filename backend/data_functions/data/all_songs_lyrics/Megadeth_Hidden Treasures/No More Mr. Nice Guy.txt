No More Mr. Nice Guy Lyrics
No more Mr. Nice Guy
Me, a Nice Guy?
Damn right!

I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
Until they got a hold of me
I opened doors for little old ladies
I helped the blind to see

I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm getting real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

No more Mr. Nice Guy
No more Mr. Clean
No more Mr. Nice Guy, they say
He's sick, he's obscene

I'm not hard to get along with
Ha! I'm impossible!
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers
They can't be seen with me
And I'm getting real shot down
And I'm feeling mean

No more Mr. Nice Guy
No more Mr. Clean
No more Mr. Nice Guy, they say
He's sick, he's obscene


My dog bit me on the leg today
My cat clawed my eye
Mom's been thrown out of the social circle
Dad's had to hide
I went to church incognito
And everybody rose
The Reverend Smith, he recognized me
He punched me in the nose
He said... no more, Nice Guy!

No more (no more) Mr. Nice Guy
No more Mr. Clean
No more Mr. Nice Guy, they say
He's sick, he's obscene
No more (no more) Mr. Nice Guy
No more Mr. Clean
No more Mr. Nice Guy, they say
He's sick, he's obscene, yeah

Not to say I was ever nice in the first place, you know?Embed
