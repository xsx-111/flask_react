Knights in Shining Karma LyricsKnights in shining karma tend your flame
And with love for armor they'll remain
Ever by your bed, guarding, still sleeping
Shield your soul from this rain
Knights in shining karma will remain
Jealous winter sun, cold as vichyssoise
Steals your smile for fuel
They'll ignite with braziers of warming stars
Knights in shining karma wash your feet
And with spotless dharma come complete
Ever by your sink drying up tea tears
Shield your soul from this heat
Knights in shining karma come complete
Swollen summer moon, hot as boiling air
Poach your dreams to ash
They'll bring sips from restful slumbers, cooling keg
Jealous winter sunEmbed
