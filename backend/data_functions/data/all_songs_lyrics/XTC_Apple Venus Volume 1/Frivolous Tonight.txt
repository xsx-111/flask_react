Frivolous Tonight LyricsLet us talk about
Some trivial things we like
A bit of this and that
Lets chew the fat
Pour ourselves a glass of Stout
And let our Rael Brook shirts hang out
Nothing makes us more content
To let us wallow in a bit of nonsense
We're all so frivolous tonight, tonight
Lets reveal our childlike nature
And leave our stocks
And invoices to rot
Lets go to pot
Tell our jokes about mothers in law
But watch him jump when she comes through the door
Oh, the party goes with a swing
When we talk about the trivial things
We're all so frivolous tonight
But there's always one
Who wants to talk shop
We'll drive him through the door
With a broom or a mop
Let us tell our favorite story
About some poor chap who put it on display
Hip hooray
And let the girls gather in their slacks
To talk about husbands' hairy backs
Some might think were a bit of a shower
But this could be our finest hour
We're all so frivolous tonight, tonight
We're all so ridiculous tonightEmbed
