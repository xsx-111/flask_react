River of Orchids LyricsHey
I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus
I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus
Take a packet of seeds, take yourself out to play
I want to see a river of orchids where we had a motorway
Push your car from the road
Push your car from the road
Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle
Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle
It's all in your backyard, you've the whole world at your feet
Said the grass is always greener when it bursts up through concrete
Push your car from the road
Push your car from the road
River of orchids winding our way
Want to walk into London on my hands one day
River of orchids, the road overgrows
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham rose
Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle
(Yeah)
Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle
(You know, you can do it)
I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil
I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil
Take a packet of seeds, take yourself out to play
I want to see a river of orchids where we had a motorway
It's all in your back yard, you've the whole world at your feet
(Push your car from the road)
Said the grass is always greener when it bursts up through concrete
Take a packet of seeds, take yourself out to play
(Push your car from the road)
I want to see a river of orchids where we had a motorway
River of orchids winding my way
Want to walk into London on my hands one day
River of orchids, the road overgrows
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham rose
River of orchids winding my way
(I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus)
Want to walk into London on my hands one day
(I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus)
River of orchids, the road overgrows
(Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle)
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham rose
(Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle)
River of orchids winding my way
(I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil)
Want to walk into London on my hands one day
(I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil)
River of orchids, the road overgrows
(I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus)
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham rose
(I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus)
River of orchids winding my way
(Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle)
Want to walk into London on my hands one day
(Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle)
River of orchids, the road overgrows
(I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil)
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham rose
(I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil)
River of orchids winding my way
(I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus)
Want to walk into London on my hands one day
(I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus)
River of orchids, the road overgrows
(Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle)
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham rose
(Just like a mad dog you're chasing your tail in a circle)
River of orchids winding my way
(I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil)
Want to walk into London on my hands one day
(I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil)1Embed
