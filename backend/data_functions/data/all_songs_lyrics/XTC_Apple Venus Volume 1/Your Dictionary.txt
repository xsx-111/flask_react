Your Dictionary LyricsH A T E, is that how you spell love in your dictionary?
K I C K, pronounced as kind
F U C K, is that how you spell friend in your dictionary?
Black on black, a guidebook for the blind
Well, now that I can see, my eyes won't weep
Now that I can hear, your song sounds cheap
Now that I can talk, all your corn I'll reap
I'm not so sure that Joey wed a virgin Mary
There are no words for me inside your dictionary
S L A P, is that how you spell kiss in your dictionary?
C O L D, pronounced as care
S H I T, is that how you spelt me in your dictionary?
Four-eyed fool, you led 'round everywhere
Well, now that I can see, it's the queens new clothes
Now that I can hear all your poison prose
Now that I can talk with my tongue unfroze
I'm not so sure of Santa or the buck-tooth fairy
There are no words for me inside your dictionary
Now your laughter has a hollow ring
But the hollow ring has no finger in
So let's close the book and let the day begin
And our marriage be undoneEmbed
