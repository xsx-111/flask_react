Fruit Nut LyricsTending my fruit, tending my fruit
Ah, you've got to have a hobby
A man must have a shed to keep him sane
Spraying my buds, spraying my buds
Got to keep away diseases
I mix the poisons and the wife don't complain
Some people say that I am out of my tree
Or just a strawberry fool
Someday they'll see, 'til then I'll blow you a raspberry
'Cause apples and pears are me
So I'm tending my fruit and I don't give a hoot
'Cause it keeps me sane, it keeps me sane
Some people say that I am out of my tree
Or just a strawberry fool
Someday they'll see, 'til then I'll blow you a raspberry
'Cos apples and pears are me
So I'm tending my fruit, tending my fruit
Ah, you've got to have a hobby
A man must have a shed to keep him sane
To keep him sane, to keep him sane, to keep him sane
Oh, the wife can't complain
To keep him sane, to keep him sane
Yeah, keeps him sane, yeah, to keep him sane
To keep him sane, yeah, it keeps him sane
To keep him saneEmbed
