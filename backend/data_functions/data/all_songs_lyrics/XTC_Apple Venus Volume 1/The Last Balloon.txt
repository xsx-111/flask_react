The Last Balloon LyricsThe last balloon is leaving
The last balloon from fear
The last balloon is leaving
Form that line right here
Climb aboard, climb aboard, you menfolk
You won't need any bombs or knives
Climb aboard, climb aboard, you menfolk
Leave all that to your former lives
Drop it all
The last balloon is leaving
The last balloon of all
The last balloon is leaving
Undress, discard, let fall
Climb aboard, climb aboard, you women
You won't need any gems or furs
Climb aboard, climb aboard, you women
Leave all that to the bad old years
Drop it all
The last balloon is leaving
The last balloon, they'll fly
The last balloon is leaving
And we won't qualify
Climb aboard, climb aboard, you children
Move aloft while your fleet and fast
Climb aboard, climb aboard, you children
We're weighed down by our evil past
Drop us all, you should drop us all
Drop us all and free your hand
Drop us all, you should drop us all
Drop us all like so much sandEmbed
