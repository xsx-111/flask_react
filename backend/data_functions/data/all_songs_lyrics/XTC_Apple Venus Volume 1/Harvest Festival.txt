Harvest Festival LyricsSee the flowers 'round the altar
See the peaches in tins
'Neath the headmaster's chair
Harvest festival
See the two who've been chosen
See them walk hand in hand
To the front of the hall
Harvest festival, harvest festival
What was best of all was the
Longing look you gave me, that longing look
More than enough to keep me fed all year
See the children with baskets
See their hair cut like corn
Neatly combed in their rows
Harvest festival, harvest festival
What was best of all was the
Longing look you gave me, that longing look
Across the hymnbooks and the canvas chairs
The longing look you gave me, that longing look
More than enough to keep me fed all year
And what a year when the exams and crops all failed
Of course, you passed and you were never seen again
We all grew and we got screwed and cut and nailed
Then out of nowhere, invitation in gold pen
See the flowers 'round the altar
See that you two got married
And I wish you well
Harvest festival, harvest festival
What was best of all was the
Longing look you gave me, that longing look
Across the hymnbooks and the canvas chairs
The longing look you gave me, that longing look
More than enough to keep me fed all year
Harvest festivalEmbed
