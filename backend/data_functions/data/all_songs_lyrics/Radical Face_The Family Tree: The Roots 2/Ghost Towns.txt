Ghost Towns LyricsI've got no need for open roads
Cause all I own fits on my back
I see the world from rusted trains
And always know I won't be back
Cause all my life is wrapped up in today
No past or future here
If I find my name's no good
I just fall out of line
But I miss you
But there's comin' home
There's no comin' home
With a name like mine
I still think of you
But everyone knows
Yeah everyone knows
If you can, let it go
I seen more places than I can name
And over time they all start to look the same
But it ain't that truth we chase
No, it's the promise of a better place
But all this time, I been chasin' down a lie
And I know it for what it is
But it beats the alternatives
So I'll take the lie
I still miss you
There's no goin' home
There's no goin' home
With a name like mine
I still dream of you
But everyone knows
Yeah everyone knows
If you can, let it go3Embed
