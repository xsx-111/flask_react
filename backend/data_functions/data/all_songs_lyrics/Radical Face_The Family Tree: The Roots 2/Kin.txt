Kin LyricsGrandma's singing in the bedroom
It's a near forgotten lullaby
That she used to sing when I wasn't well
Father's outside chopping firewood
Like he did when he'd been drinking
Or when he and mom were at it again
Grandpa's rocking chair is rocking
I can hear the wood complaining
And the idle taps as he empties his pipe
I do my best to just ignore them
But the sound always finds me
Despite them being dead and gone
I hear them all the time
I hear them all the time
I hear them all the time
I hear them all the time
I hear you all the time
I feel you in my mind
I cannot sleep, but I'm tryin'
I hear you all the timeEmbed
