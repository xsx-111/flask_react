A Pound of Flesh LyricsMy feet plow on
From light to dawn
My empty belly and my body aches
Ain't hard to take
Next to the weight I carry in my chest
A pound of flesh
Could never tip the scale that I've made
I should have stayed
But I was never wise
I hear your voices in the wind
That cuts the night
And I pray to whatever is listening
Things'll be alright
Oh my boy you're alive
Your heart's still beating
So don't you mind
Don't you mind
We all drift sometimes
I can still hear your feet
As you ran from the house
Knowing you won't be back
Doesn't mean that I will stop waiting
You told me then:
"Hold me down, or hold me up to the fire
But don't you dare hold me back!"
I see your faces in the clouds
That scar the night
And I pray to whoever is listening
Things'll be alright
Then today I wake up feeling easy
And find I'm on the more familiar roads
I got a darkness wrapped inside me
But now it ain't so hard to let it go
So keep your candle burning in the window
I'm almost home1Embed
