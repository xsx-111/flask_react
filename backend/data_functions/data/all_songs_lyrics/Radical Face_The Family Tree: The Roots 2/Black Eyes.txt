Black Eyes LyricsWhen you last left me my blood was in a jar
And you kept it on your mantlepiece
I couldn’t count on anyone to stand there behind me
And keep the dogs from dragging me off with them
While I slept, you crept in
And pulled the rug right out from under me
In the rain you stole away
And took the parts that kept me functioning
Now my heart will be blacker than your eyes when I’m through with you
And I said: "This life ain’t no love song"
While I marched on blindly
And my knuckles dragged across the walls
And the birds up there mock me and the scenery’s turned wicked
And your name is trapped beneath my tongue
All of the roads are one now, each choice is the same
All the roads, they are one now, each choice is the same
I won’t show my hands now, I know this ain’t a game
All the roads, they are one now, each choice is…
Take a step, take another step, take another step
Not a care for where they fall
You burned me, yeah, you’ve burned me
Yeah, you’ve burned me now one too many times
My thoughts are the cold kind
I got storm clouds that are brewing behind my eyes
And my heart will be blacker than your eyes when I’m through with you1Embed
