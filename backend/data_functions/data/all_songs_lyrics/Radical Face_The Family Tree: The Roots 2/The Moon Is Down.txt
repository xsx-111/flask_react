The Moon Is Down LyricsThere ain't no moon tonight
It's hard for me to see
But if I can catch a glimpse of you
It helps me feel at ease
It helps me sleep
All my life I've watched you dance along
To music that I can't hear
I ain't equipped to hear those songs
I like the way you talk about all the things you've seen
You make the world seem small for a time
Though it's still too big for me
All my life I've watched you dance along
To music that I can't hear
I ain't equipped to hear those songs
You were never at rest
You were always somewhere-bound
But as for me, I'm the simple kind
I'll live and die in this town
And I know my home ain't big enough
That it would only keep you down
And I'd hate to see you caged
So all that I ask
Is you come say hi when you're around
It ain't much
But it's good enough for meEmbed
