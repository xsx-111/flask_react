Sleep Lyrics
"They're, they're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my
They're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat
Night, uh, they're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors, they're, they're these terrors
Like last night, uh, they're not like tremors, they're worse than tremors, they're, they're these terrors
And it's like, it feels like as if somebody was gripping my throat and squeezing and
It's like, as if like somebody was gripping my throat"

Some say now suffer all the children
And walk away a savior
Or a madman and polluted
From gutter institutions
Don't you breathe for me
Undeserving of your sympathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm sorry for what I did

And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye
And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part
Is letting go of your dreams

A drink for the horror that I'm in
For the good guys and the bad guys
For the monsters that I've been
Three cheers for tyranny
Unapologetic apathy
'Cause there ain't no way that I'm coming back again

And through it all
How could you cry for me?
'Cause I don't feel bad about it
So shut your eyes
Kiss me goodbye

And sleep
Just sleep
The hardest part's
The awful things that I've seen
"Sometimes I see flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always
I see flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always"
Just sleep
"Flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always"
Just sleep
"Flames, and sometimes
I see people that I love dying and it's always"

Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Just sleep
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

"Falling and sometimes when I sleep and I can't
I can't ever wake up"35Embed
