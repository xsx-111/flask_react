House of Wolves Lyrics
Well, I know a thing about contrition
Because I got enough to spare
And I'll be granting your permission
'Cause you haven't got a prayer
Well, I said hey, hallelujah
I'm gonna, come on, sing the praise
And let the spirit come on through you
We got innocence for days

Well, I think I'm gonna burn in Hell
Everybody burn the house right down

And say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave, yeah, go

S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
S-I-N, I S-I-N
You play ring around the ambulance
Like you never gave a care
So get the choir boys around you
It's a compliment, I swear
And I said ashes to ashes, we all fall down
I wanna hear you sing the praise
I said ashes to ashes, we all fall down
We got innocence for days

Well, I think I'm gonna burn in Hell
Everybody burn the house right down

And say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave, yeah

You better run like the devil 'cause they're never gonna leave you alone
You better hide up in the alley 'cause they're never gonna find you a home
And as the blood runs down the walls (Blood runs down the wall)
You see me creeping up these halls (Creeping up these halls)
I've been a bad motherfucker (Halls), tell your sister I'm another
Go, go, go
And I said, say what I wanna say
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave
Tell me I'm a bad man, kick me like a stray
Tell me I'm an angel, take this to my grave

Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man
Tell me I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad man

So get up
So get out
S-I-N, I S-I-N43Embed
