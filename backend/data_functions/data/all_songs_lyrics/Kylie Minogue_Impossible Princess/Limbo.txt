Limbo Lyrics
I see them all smiling, those all around me
They tend to my wounds and alert my senses
And it would be nice but I'm not here
I'm dreaming, holding on

Time has no meaning, all of it wasted
It smothers me 'til there's no more air
When will it be that I can breathe again?
I'm waiting in the void

(Limbo) Lost in limbo
(Limbo) Limbo, limbo
(Limbo) Lost in limbo
(Limbo)

This notion of needing has held me ransom
And all I can do is avoid my mind
Don't make me speak or hear or look
Because I'm hurting, help me out

(Limbo) Lost in limbo
(Limbo) Limbo, limbo
(Limbo) Lost in limbo
(Limbo) I'm in limbo
I'm killing time
I'm killing time, time, time, time, time, time, time, time

Caught in the crossfire, nobody gets it
I'm finding it hard to contain myself
Take all my trust and faith and hope
Until I need it once again

(Limbo) Lost in limbo
(Limbo) Limbo, limbo
(Limbo) Lost in limbo
(Limbo) Limbo, limbo
(Limbo) Lost in limbo
(Limbo) Limbo, limbo
(Limbo) I lost in limbo
(Limbo) I'm in limbo
(Limbo) Lost in limbo
(Limbo) Limbo, limbo
(Limbo) I lost in limbo
(Limbo) I'm in limbo
