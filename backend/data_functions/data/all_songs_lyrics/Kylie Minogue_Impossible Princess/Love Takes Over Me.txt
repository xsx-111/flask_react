Love Takes Over Me Lyrics
I am lost in the world of you
Can't believe where you take me to
As soon as you enter my mind
Or you crawl over my skin
Leave me no other choice but to let you in

Love takes over me (I can feel it)
Because, your love takes over me (I can see it)
Oh, your love takes over me (I can taste it)
Yeah, your love takes over me (I can be it)

Take me now, I can't take no more
Feel me breathe, feel the energy
How did I fall prey to this?
Pleasure is my lonely guide
Yeah, I escaped despite of you
Now that you're inside

Love takes over me (I can feel it)
When your love takes over me (I can see it)
Oh, your love takes over me (I can taste it)
Yeah, your love takes over me (I can be it)
Magic is running through my veins
Pleasure is coming closer then
So, hurt with me now
So I won't hurt no more
Hear me scream, hear my suffering

When your love takes over me (I can feel it)
When your love takes over me (I can see it)
Oh, your love takes over me (I can taste it)
Your love takes over me (I can be it)
(I can feel it) Love takes over me
(I can see it) Love takes over me
(I can taste it) Love takes over me
(I can be it)1Embed
