Dreams Lyrics
To have any man but to love only one
To wake with the moon and sleep with the sun
To be a sinner, a saint, a lover and friend
To know a beginning but never an end
To fly in the ocean, swim in the skys
Believer in truth, defendant of lies
To know the purest love, the deepest pain
To be lost and found again and again and again

These are the dreams
Of an impossible princess
These are the dreams
Of an impossible princess

To know the power of wealth and poverty
To taste every moment and try everything
To be hailed as a hero, branded a fool
Believe in the sacred and break every rule
To give in to pleasure with no boundaries
Living in chaos and harmony
To feel the touch of a man, a woman's caress
To know the limits of torture and tenderness
These are the dreams
Of an impossible princess (of an impossible princess)
These are the dreams
Of an impossible princess

Man and woman, boy and girl
They want to escape this world
Man and woman, boy and girl
They want to escape this world
(Nothing is what it seems, living in a dream)

(These are the dreams)
Of an impossible princess
(These are the dreams)
Of an impossible princess

It's a way of dealing with all the feeling
Keep believing in dreams
(Of an impossible princess)
It's a way of dealing with all the feeling
Keep believing in dreams
(Of an impossible princess)Embed
