Breathe Lyrics
Don't blame me just because I am bored
I'm needy, I need to taste it all
Don't doubt me just because I am quiet
I'm thinking, thinking about it all

I'm helpless about the way of me
I'm thinking, thinking about it all
I'm sorting everything inside
I'm looking in the space

This time, this void
I'm making my way through the muddy minutes
The pull is in my muscle
The ache is in my bones
It's hard to be alone
Breathe, breathe, it won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe

See through me when I put up a fight
Like you to see the things I hide
Go deeper than I won't let you know
I'm frightened but I won't let it show
I'm helpless (I'm helpless) about the way of me
I'm thinking (I'm thinking), thinking about it all
I'm sorting everything inside
I'm looking in the space

This time, this void
I'm making my way through the muddy minutes
The pull is in my muscle
The ache is in my bones (bones)
It's hard to be alone (to be alone)
Breathe, breathe, it won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe

Breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe

Breathe, breathe, it won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe
It won't be long now, breathe, breathe5Embed
