Say Hey LyricsIt's getting late
You might be sleeping
I couldn't wait
I'm caught up with feeling this way
Don't want to disturb you
But I must just to say: "Hey!"
I'm missing you
I wish you were with me
The water's warm
It's making me in the mood to play
So good to disturb you
If you please, I need to say: "Hey!"
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I wish you were with me1Embed
