Did It Again Lyrics
Clever girl, think you are but you think too much
Shut down, turn around
Don't look that way any more
Clever girl, think you know but you don't know much
Try to make a move
Go to a different door

You know it's all in your head
You better put that business to bed
By your fair hands of design you met with
The monster in your mind

You did it again, you did it again
Won't you listen to me when I'm telling you it's no good for you?

Clever girl, think you're right but what's right from wrong?
Little Miss Genius
You make it hard on yourself
Clever girl, you've got it all but you're all messed up
Time now, turn around
Move onto something else
You know it's all in your head
You'd better put that business to bed
What you see nobody sees
It only brings you to your knees

You did it again, you did it again
Won't you listen to me when I'm telling you it's no good for you?
You did it again, you did it again
Won't you listen to me when I'm telling you it's no good for you?


You know it's all in your head
You better put that business to bed
By your fair hands of design you met with
The monster in your mind

You did it again, you did it again
Won't you listen to me when I'm telling you it's no good for you?
You did it again, you did it again
Won't you listen to me when I'm telling you it's no good for you?
You did it again, you did it again
Won't you listen to me when I'm telling you it's no good for you?4Embed
