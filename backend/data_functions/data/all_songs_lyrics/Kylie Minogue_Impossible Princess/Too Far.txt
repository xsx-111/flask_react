Too Far Lyrics
Caught up in this house
Trapped my very own self in the snare of my mind
No more space than a slither
What I'd give for deep breath inside
Where the chaos has me captive
Where there's no exit sign
Where I fuel the stupid fire with these feelings of mine

Lured into this den
It's bitter and I want the sweetness again
A taste that I agree with
Get me past these perils and to my Eden
Where the silence is a comfort
Where there is no one else
Where I'll be up from under and can uncurl myself

Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far

Too far, too far, too far, too far
Too far, too far, too far
Can I smash all of this open?
Can I pass the hurt with a little pain?
I wanna see all of it crumble
And start afresh and over again
My eyes are wide open but I can hardly see
Will laughter find a way around these silent tears?

Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far

Too far, too far, too far, too far
Too far, too far, too far, too far
Too far, too far, too far, too far
Too far, too far, too far

Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far
Too many, too much, too hard
Help me, this time I went too far

Too far, too far, too far, too far
Too far, too far, too far6Embed
