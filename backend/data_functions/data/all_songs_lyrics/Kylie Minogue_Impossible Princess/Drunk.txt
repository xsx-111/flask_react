Drunk Lyrics
I'm suffocated with desire
I need to save me from myself
I ache for great experience
There's a riot in my senses

Time and space and hurt and tears are not enough
Love and light and faith and words are not enough

I'm not happy drunk 'til I'm drunken
'Til you take all of me

You put me to the test and I understand
There's more and more and more to know
Don't take me halfway (don't take me halfway)
I won't be contented that way

Time and space and hurt and tears are not enough
Love and light and faith and words are not enough

Time flies like my love for you
And space grows like my envy for you
Hurt comes like my pain for you
And tears pour like my lust for you
Love lies like my hope for you
And light falls like my armour for you
Faith stays like my care for you
And words wait like my crave for you
I'm not happy drunk 'til I'm drunken
'Til you take all of me
I'm not happy waste 'til I'm wasted
'Til you take all of me
I'm not happy drunk 'til I'm drunken
'Til you take all of me
I'm not happy waste 'til I'm wasted
'Til you take all of me

Time and space and hurt and tears and love and light and faith and words are not enough
Time and space and hurt and tears and love and light and faith and words are not enough

Time flies like my love for you
And space grows like my envy for you
Hurt comes like my pain for you
And tears pour like my lust for you
Love lies like my hope for you
And light falls like my armour for you
Faith stays like my care for you
And words wait like my crave for youEmbed
