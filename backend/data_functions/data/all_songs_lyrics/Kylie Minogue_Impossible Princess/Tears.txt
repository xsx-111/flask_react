Tears Lyrics
Never would say I never needed anyone
Not now I have knowing of the real love
And I need to have you
I could never give it up
Because the hurt would be too much
And the feeling I'm feeling is a feeling I like
It's only when I'm with you that I feel all right
I'm amazed that it's come to this

I love you to tears
I love you to tears

Falling into you
I've fallen on my feet
My world was only turning
So that we could meet
And I want you always
I could never run away
Working destiny today
And the giving I'm giving is a giving I like
It's easy when I'm with you to give into life
I'm amazed that it's come to this
[I love you to tears
I love you to tears
I love you to tears
I love you to tears

Happier than high, this is happening
So cool to have this salt water on my skin
It's not a pool of sorrow that I'm harboring
These are tears of joy that I'm swimming in
Happier than high, this is happening
So cool to have this salt water on my skin
It's not a pool of sorrow that I'm harboring
These are tears of joy that I'm swimming in
Happier than high, I'm happier than high
I'm happier than high, I'm happier than high

I love you to tears
I love you to tears
I love you to tears
I love you to tears
I love you to tears
I love you to tearsEmbed
