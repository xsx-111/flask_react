Through the Years LyricsThis fever I have is because of you
My body is blazing
The flames alight and lick at my ear
So that I can only hear
Muddled words of you
Through the years
Too many a trusted word was said
My body was porous
I savoured every drop of you
Took me it all as true
Now I wander my way
Through the years
Through the years
Ooh, you blinded me with all your light
I wish I could see now
Promises and lies ignite the fire
And I wonder why I believed in you
Through the years
Through the years
Through the years
Of joy and laughter
Of tears and sadness (sadness)
Of hopes and heart
Through the years of love and loving (loving)
Of hurt and healing (healing)
Falling apart, oh
I believed in you
I believed in you
I believed in you
And I wonder, wonder why
I'm no longer fooled by your disguise
I'm sorry that you are, ha
I pity all the pretensions of you
And now I start anew, I wish my way
Through the years
Through the years
Through the years
Through the years
Through the yearsEmbed
