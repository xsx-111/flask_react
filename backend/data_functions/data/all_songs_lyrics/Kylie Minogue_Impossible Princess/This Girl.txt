This Girl Lyrics
Take me as I am
Though I'm good at pretending
I tire easily and hurry to the ending
There's more than what you see
But not the way you see it
I hope you follow me
And you get the meaning

Here is where I stand
Here is who I am
And I'm not interested in fitting in
I only want to be, to be this girl
I'm not interested in giving in
I only want to be this girl

Take me as you will
Under no illusions
I offer myself whole
I give into you
And I offer you the sky
The sun and moon and seas
But you need to know that
I'm not more or less than me
Here is where I stand
Here is who I am
And I'm not interested in fitting in
I only want to be, to be this girl
I'm not interested in giving in
I only want to be this girl
I'm not interested in fitting in
I only want to be, to be this girl
I'm not interested in giving in
I only want to be this girl
Oooh, ooh, this girlEmbed
