Some Kind of Bliss Lyrics
Shut my eyes, feel the colour of you
So get to this elation, so high, so fast
Shut my eyes, feel the colour of you
Succumb to this illusion, so strong, so deep

'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss

Study my reflection and let the covers fall
Slip into stillness and be above it all
Good to be here, time to be alone
Find a space where I belong
Not succumb to fear

'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss

'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss
'Cause everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss

'Cause everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday is all there is
In my some kind of bliss2Embed
