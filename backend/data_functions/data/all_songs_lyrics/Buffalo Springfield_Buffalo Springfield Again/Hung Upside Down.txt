Hung Upside Down Lyrics
Look what's happening to me
I'm going blind, please help
There I sat until three
Gettin' further behind myself
By myself

And I'm hung upside down
And I'm hung upside down
Oh, hung upside down, yeah
'Said I'm hung upside down
C'mon, c'mon, hung upside down
Hey, oh-oh

Someday, I will be free
And there'll be times, you just wait (You just wait)
I will come to you, see what I'll bring you
When I get straight
Oh, it's too late

And I'm hung upside down
And I'm hung upside down
Hung upside down, oh, yeah
Hung upside down, down, uh
Hung upside down, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, uh, yeah, c'mon
Uh, uh, yeah, huh
Huh, yeah, huh, yeah
Huh, yeahEmbed
