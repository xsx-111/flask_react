Expecting to Fly Lyrics
There you stood on the edge of your feather
Expecting to fly
While I laughed, I wondered whether
I could wave goodbye
Knowing that you'd gone?

By the summer, it was healing
We had said goodbye
All the years we'd spent with feeling
Ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry
Babe, ended with a cry

I tried so hard to stand
As I stumbled and fell to the ground
So hard to laugh as I fumbled
And reached for the love I'd found
Knowing it was gone

If I ever lived without you
Now you know I died
If I ever said I loved you
Now you know I tried
Babe, now you know I tried
Babe, now you know I tried
