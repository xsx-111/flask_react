Sad Memory Lyrics
Soft winds blow in the summertime
Young lovers feel so free
Walking hand-in-hand down a shady lane
What happened to me?
What happened to me?

Did you ever love a girl
Who walked right out on you?
You should know just how I feel, then
Why I'm so blue
Why I'm so blue

How can I forget those nights
When she'd kiss me soft and true?
And whisper words only lovers know
"I love you
I love you"

Well, I've made up my mind, I'll find a new girl
Who'll love me tenderly
Forget the past I left behind, now
To sad memory
To sad memory
Soft winds blow in the summertimeEmbed
