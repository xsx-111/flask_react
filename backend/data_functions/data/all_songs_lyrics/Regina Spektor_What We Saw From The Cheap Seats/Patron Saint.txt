Patron Saint Lyrics
She's the kind of girl
Who'll smash herself down in the night
She's the kind of girl
Who'll fracture her mind till it's light
She'll break her own heart
And you know that she'll break your heart too
So darling, let go of her hand
She's been skipping days
Spilling her drinks in the sink
And you know she never coming home
Never coming home again
But when, when, when
She open her eyes, eyes, eyes
Beyond the
Chipping paint through the windowpane
Lies, lies, lies
Her patron saint, broken and lame
And absolutely insane
For learning that true love exists
So darling, let go of her hand
Let go of her hand
Let go of her hand
Let go of her hand
Let go of her hand
Let go of her hand
Let go of her hand
You'll be to blame
For playing this game
And learning
That true love
Exists
She's the kind of girl
Who'll smash herself down in the night
She's the kind of girl
Who'll fracture her mind till it's light
She'll break her own heart
And you know that she'll break your heart too
So darling, let go of her hand
Darling, let go of her hand
You'll be to blame
For playing this game
And learning
That true love exists
Broken and lame and knowing
That true love exists
The pain, the pain, the pain
Of knowing that true love
