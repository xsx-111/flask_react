Small Town Moon Lyrics
I must've left a thousand times
But every day begins the same
Cause there's a small town in my mind
How can I leave without hurting everyone that made me?
How can I leave without hurting everyone that made me?

Oh, baby, baby, it's all about the moon
I wish you wouldn't have broke my camera
Cause we're gonna get real old real soon
Today we're younger than we ever gonna be
Today we're younger than we ever gonna be, woo!
Today we're younger than we ever gonna be

Stop, stop, what's the hurry?
Come on, baby, don't you worry, worry
Everybody not so nice, nice
Everybody not so nice, nice
Stop, stop, what's the hurry?
Come on, baby, don't you worry, worry
Everybody not so nice, nice
Everybody not so nice, nice
Thought you ought to know by now
I thought you ought to know by now
Everybody not so nice, nice
Everybody not so nice, nice
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, it's all about the moon
I must've left a thousand times
But there's a small town in my mind
How can I leave without hurting everyone that made me?
How can I leave without hurting everyone that made me? Woo
How can I leave without hurting everyone that made me? Oh!
How can I leave without hurting everyone that made me? Oh!
How can I leave without hurting everyone that made me? Oh!
How can I leave without hurting everyone that made me?1Embed
