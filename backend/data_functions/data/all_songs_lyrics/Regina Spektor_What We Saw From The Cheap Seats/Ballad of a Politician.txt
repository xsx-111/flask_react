Ballad of a Politician Lyrics
A man inside a room is shaking hands with other men
This is how it happens
Our carefully laid plans
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake your ass out in that street
You're going to make 'em scream someday
You're going to make it big
You love so deep, so tender
Your people and your land
You love them until they can't recall
Who they are again
Work it, work it baby
Work your way around that room
You're going to make it big some day
You're going to make a boom
But I am
But I am
But I am not a number, not a name
But I am
But I am
But I am a carefully laid plan
Shake what your mama gave you
You know that it won't last
You're going to taste the ground real soon
You're going to taste the grass
A man inside a room is shaking hands with other men
This is how it happens
Our world under command
Shake it, shake it baby
Shake your ass out in that street
You're going to make us scream someday
You're going to make us weep

You're going to make us scream someday
You're going to make it big6Embed
