Jessica Lyrics
Jessica, wake up
Jessica, wake up
It's February again, we must get older, so wake up
I can't write a song for you
I'm out of melodies
I can't write a song for you
But I am asking please

Jessica, wake up
Jessica, wake up
It's February again
It's February again, we must get older, now, so please wake up
We must get older now, so please wake up2Embed
