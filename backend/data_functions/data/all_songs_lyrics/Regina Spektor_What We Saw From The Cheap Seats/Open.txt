Open Lyrics
I am down the road and up the hill
I wait for you still
Wires 'round my fingers

Potentially lovely
Perpetually human
Suspended and open

Open
Open

I am through the woods and past the trains
I wait here in vain
Scrubbing out the stains again

Potentially lovely
Perpetually human
Suspended and open

Open
Open
In the night, the snow starts falling
And everybody stares
Through their windows at the streetlights
Too beautiful to see

I am in a room I've built myself
Four straight walls
One floor, one ceiling
And day after day I wake up feeling
Day after day I wake up feeling, feeling

Potentially lovely
Perpetually human
Suspended and open

Open
Open
Open

Open up your eyes
And thenEmbed
