Call Them Brothers LyricsThat's it, it's split - it won't recover
Just frame the halves and call them brothers
Find your fathers and your mothers
If you remember who they are
Over and over, they call us their friends
Can't we find something else to pretend?
Like nobody won and we're safe at the end
In the darkness, the film machine's spinning
So let's leave it on
We'll be out in the street
Before anyone knows that we're gone
That's it, it's split- it can't recover
Just frame the halves and call them a whole
And chip at the bricks and fill up your pockets
With the pieces of the wall that you stole
The hunt is on, everyone's chasing
Everyone's chasing a shot
A shot rings out, nobody wants it
Nobody wants it to stop
That's it, it's split - it won't recover
Just frame the halves and call them brothers
Find your fathers and your mothers
If you remember who they are
If you remember, if you remember
If you remember, if you remember
If you remember who they are1Embed
