Room Games and Diamond Rain LyricsI'm gonna love you for a hundred years
Through suffering and celebration, dear
'Cause only you can make my lies come true
You can make lies real
And you can make me feel
Like drinking wine in the shade all afternoon
You keep finding and reminding me
That you only can be kind to me
When you got with me and started dreaming my dreams
But, darling, there's a gun in the garland
And you need to know
That the dream is not all dream
Room games and diamond rain
It's a fox hunt
It's an F-stop
It's a ten acre wood
Outbound on a western train
It costs a quarter, man
Out on the border land
I can dance real good
Real good
A freight train rattles a chandelier
And if we're like plug-in reindeer
Whose cords can't stretch far enough to fly
We're gonna take a ride in the dirt
We're gonna die till it doesn't hurt
Then they can bury us side by side
Room games and diamond rain
It's a fox hunt
It's an F-stop
It's a ten acre wood
Outbound on a western train
It costs a quarter, man
Out on the border land
I can dance real good
Real goodEmbed
