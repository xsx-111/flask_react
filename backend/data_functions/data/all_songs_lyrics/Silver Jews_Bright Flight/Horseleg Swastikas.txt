Horseleg Swastikas LyricsI'm drunk on a couch in Nashville
In a duplex near the reservoir
And every single thought is like a punch in the face
I'm like a rabbit freezing on a star
On the wrong side of Sunday morning
Shattered in the terrible light
Working for a bankrupt circus
On the wrong side of Saturday night
And I wanna be like water if I can
'Cause water doesn't give a damn
Water doesn't give a damn
Chased by a floating hatchet
You can't just shoot your way out and go
I could tell you things about this wallpaper
That you'd never ever want to know
But there's an altar in the valley
For the things in themselves as they are
And the triumph of the obstacle
And horseleg swastikas
I wanna take a ride on the back of a sunbird
Up into the highest number
Up into the highest number
And I wanna be like water if I can
'Cause water doesn't give a damn
Water doesn't give a damnEmbed
