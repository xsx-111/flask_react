Death of an Heir of Sorrows LyricsI wish I lived in the power and light
I wish it wasn't Saturday night
'Cause I can't raise hell
No, I can't raise hell for two
I wish I had a thousand bucks
I wish I was the Royal Trux
But mostly I wish
I wish I was with you
When I was summoned to the phone
I knew in my bones that you had died alone
We'd never been promised there will be a tomorrow
So let's just call it the death of an heir of sorrows
The death of an heir of sorrows
I have not avoided certainty
It has always just eluded me
I wish I knew
I wish I knew for true
I wish I had a rhinestone suit
I wish I had a new pair of boots
But mostly I wish
I wish I was with you
We'd never been promised there will be a tomorrow
So let's just call it the death of an heir of sorrows
The death of an heir of sorrowsEmbed
