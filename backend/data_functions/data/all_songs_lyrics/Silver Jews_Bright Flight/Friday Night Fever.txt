Friday Night Fever LyricsI love the sound of a jukebox playing
So I sit here while she's staying home
Watching Dallas on TV
I love the taste of whiskey straight
The strongest thing she ever takes
Is a sip from a small glass of chablis
I've got that Friday night fever
Sometimes a man just needs a breather
She knows I love her and I need her
And I'm no cheater
I've just got that Friday night fever
She wouldn't change me if she could
I wouldn't change her, she's too good
Sometimes a man just needs a change of pace
I've heard all those come-on lines
But I go home at closing time
I know no one could ever take her place
I've got that Friday night fever
Sometimes a man just needs a breather
She knows I love her and I need her
And I'm no cheater
I've just got that Friday night feverEmbed
