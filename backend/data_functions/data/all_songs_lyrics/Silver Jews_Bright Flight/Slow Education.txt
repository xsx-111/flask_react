Slow Education LyricsWhen God was young
He made the wind and the sun
And since then
It's been a slow education
And you got that one idea again
The one about dying
Oh, oh, oh, I'm lightning
Oh, oh, oh, I'm rain
Oh, oh, oh, it's frightening
I'm not the same
I'm not the same
I'm not the same
There's a screen door banging in the wind
Remember you wanted to be like George Washington back then
Everybody going down on themselves
No pardon me's or fair thee well's in the end
And you got that one idea again
The one about dying
Oh, oh, oh, I'm lightning
Oh, oh, oh, I'm rain
Oh, oh, oh, it's frightening
I'm not the same
I'm not the same
I'm not the sameEmbed
