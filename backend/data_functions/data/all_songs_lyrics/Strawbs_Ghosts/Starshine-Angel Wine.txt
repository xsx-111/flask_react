Starshine/Angel Wine Lyrics
I can hear you, like the rain that falls so sweetly
I can hear you, like the sun that dries the fields and feeds the grain
I can hear your spirit singing sweet refrains
Oh little starshine, oh little starshine
I can feel you, like a breath of fresh green pastures
I can feel you, like the touch of summer breezes in my hair
I can feel your presence flowing through the air
Oh little starshine, oh little star

The sun was sinking in the West
The sky was burning wild
As evening showed its starlit crest
I looked deep into my child
Oh fool, oh mortal man
We live life as we can
But now who do I think I am?
The world is black, the world is white
The world is you and I
We surely ought to see the light
That burns in children's eyes
Oh Lord, give us a sign
The world's a bitter crime
That soon we may taste angel wine
I see my future clearly now
My world is full of song
Be truthful to yourself, my child
And your heart will be forever strong
Oh Lord, give us a sign
The world's a bitter crime
That soon we may taste angel wine
Oh Lord, give us a sign
The world's a bitter crime
That soon we may taste angel wineEmbed
