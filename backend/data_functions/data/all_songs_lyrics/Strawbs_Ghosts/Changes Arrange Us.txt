Changes Arrange Us Lyrics
It's a warm summer's evening and it's been a beautiful day
But the sky is getting darker in a special kind of way
I'm anticipating something, think it's going to be okay
'Cause tomorrow will show me what I can't see today

Oh those changes arranges like a warm thunderstorm
'Cause it's change comes to cool us and you know it can't be wrong
Evolution moves us from the moment we are born
So just blow with the wind of the warm thunderstorm

Change is three white horses, one creates and one maintains
And though the last one is destructive, it can come to ease your pain
'Cause you're caught up in the wheel of life, you can't escape
You shouldn't try to resist it, you know the force is far too great

Oh those changes arranges like a warm thunderstorm
'Cause it's change comes to cool us and you know it can't be wrong
Evolution moves us from the moment we are born
So just blow with the wind of the warm thunderstorm

Everybody gets some, it'll catch you if you run
You know you never can escape it, can't you feel it's got to come
Sometimes something will tell you that you just can't stay this way
Even though it has been a most beautiful day
Oh those changes arranges like a warm thunderstorm
'Cause it's change comes to cool us and you know it can't be wrong
Evolution moves us from the moment we are born
So just blow with the wind of the warm thunderstorm

Oh those changes arranges like a warm thunderstorm
'Cause it's change comes to cool us and you know it can't be wrong
Evolution moves us from the moment we are born
So just blow with the wind or the warm thunderstormEmbed
