Where Do You Go (When You Need a Hole to Crawl In) Lyrics
When you were young you were protected
When you were growing you were sheltered
But when you reached your adult years
You were left alone
And you had no one to rely on
No one to care for you
A lost soul in search of some kind of shelter and protection

Now where do you run?
Where do you hide?
Where do you go?
When you need a hole to crawl in
Where do you go?

I found that in our darkest hour
The young ones that I knew and loved well
Beckoned with the memory
Of their alluring spell
And so I gathered up my senses
Bade one and all Godspeed
If my ways were what you desired then love is what you must need
Now where do you run?
Where do you hide?
Where do you go?
When you need a hole to crawl in
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

I tried to find a consolation
But realized that deep down inside
Consolation is but yet
My all despairing pride
And now I'm dark eyed and bewildered
My guts can't feel the strain
My mouth is dry, my chest is tight
And my forehead's lined with the pain

Now where do you run?
Where do you hide?
Where do you go?
When you need a hole to crawl in
Where do you go?
Won't you tell me?

Now where do you run?
Where do you hide?
Where do you go?
When you need a hole to crawl in
Where do you go?
Where do you go?
Where do you run?Embed
