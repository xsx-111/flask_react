Lemon Pie Lyrics
The sharper is the berry
The sweeter is the wine
The longer we are parted
The sooner you are mine (You are mine)

Lovely lemon lady
You make me feel so shy
But lovely lemon lady
I love your lemon pie (I love your lemon pie)

The stronger the deception
The lesser grow my lies
The shallower the whole truth
The deeper are my eyes (Are my eyes)

Lovely lemon lady
You make me feel so shy
But lovely lemon lady
I love your lemon pie

Bitter lemon lady smile
I'll see you in a little while
Lemon lady sweet and sour
You have me in your lemon power
My lemon pie
The simpler the solution
The more that it will mean
The greater the resistance
The further I will lean (I will lean)

Lovely lemon lady
You make me feel so shy
But lovely lemon lady
I love your lemon pie (I love your lemon pie)

Lemon, lemon pieEmbed
