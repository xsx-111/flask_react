Tell Me to My Face LyricsAnd though you try to justify the meaning
Of the note you sent this evening
To my door you're not deceiving me
Well, I'd have thought that, you'd have known much better
Sending 'round an unsigned letter
Facing me would be much better now
Is it just that you can't face the future with me?
Can't you tell me to my face?
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my place?
And now I know my love is lost on you
And nothing you can say or do
Will turn my head around
I'd have thought you'd have decency
To come and tell the truth to me
Instead of telling lies, your eyes betray
Is it just that you can't face the future with me?
Can't you tell me to my face?
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my place
Tell me to my face you're leaving now
Tell me to my face that you're leaving now
And though you try to justify the meaning
Of the note you sent this evening
To my door you're not deceiving me
Well, I'd have thought that you'd have known much better
Sending 'round an unsigned letter
Facing me would be much better now
Is it just that you can't face the future with me?
Can't you tell me to my face?
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my place?
Tell me to my face you're leaving now
Tell me to my face that you're leaving nowEmbed
