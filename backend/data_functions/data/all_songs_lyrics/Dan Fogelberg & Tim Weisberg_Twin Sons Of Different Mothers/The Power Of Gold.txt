The Power Of Gold Lyrics
The story is told of the
Power of gold
And its lure on the unsuspecting
It glitters and shines
It badgers and blinds
And constantly needs protecting

Balance the cost of the soul you lost
With the dreams you lightly sold
Are you under
The power of gold?

The power of gold

The letters and calls
Got you climbing the walls
And everyone wants a favor
They beg to remind you
Of times left behind you
But you know the past is a loser

The face you're wearing is different now
And the days run hot and cold
Are you under
The power of gold?
The power of gold

You're a creature of habit
Run like a rabbit
Scared of a fear you can't name
Your own paranoia
Is looming before you
But nobody thinks that
It's a game

Balance the cost of the soul you lost
With the dreams you lightly sold
Then tell me
That you're free
Of the power of gold

The women are lovely
The wine is superb
But there's something about the song
That disturbs you...Embed
