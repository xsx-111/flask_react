And I Will Love You (Bonus Track) LyricsI know a place
Not far away where the sun always shines
You will be mine
And i'll love you
I know a place where the sun always shines
You will be mine
And i'll love you
Church bells will chime
And they will know you are mine
All of the time
I will love you
Church bells will chime so they know you are mine
All of the time
I will love you
The finest moments in my life
Is when you say you'll be my wife
Church bells will chime
And they will know you are mine
All of the time
I will love you
Church bells will chime so they know you are mine
All of the time
I will love you
Yeah, i'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love youEmbed
