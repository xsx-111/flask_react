Out of My System LyricsYou're out of reach, you're out of touch
This time baby you've run out of love
You're out of sight, you're out of mind
Another heartache I've left behind
It doesn't make any difference
Where you go from here
Too many times you've been running
I was here, over and over again
Well, I've got you out of my system
I've got you out of my soul
We've been through this a thousand times
Too many partners for your perfect crimes
You turned your back when I was down
Well, this time baby I won't be around
It doesn't make any difference
What you do or say
This time it's over forever
I'm on my way
Don't wanna see you again
Well, I've got you out of my system
I've got you out of my soul
Well, I've got you out of my system
And now I'm right outside your control
It doesn't make any difference
Where you go from here
Too many times you've been running
I was here, over and over again
Well, I've got you out of my system
I've got you out of my soul
Well, I've got you out of my system, out of my system
And now I'm right outside your control
I've got you out of my system
Well, I've got you out of my system
Out of my system
I've got you out of my soul
Out of my soul
Well, I've got you out of my system
Out of my system
And now I'm right outside your controlEmbed
