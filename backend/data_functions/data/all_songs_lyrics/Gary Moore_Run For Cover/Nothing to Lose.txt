Nothing to Lose LyricsYou live your life in a state of confusion
Never finding your way
You've had the breaks
But you're so disillusioned
You only live for today
You never stopped for a red light
You never even tried
You're on the wrong side of midnight
Too fast to live, but too young to die
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
Keep on singing the blues
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
You've got nothing to lose
You say that you've got a hot reputation
You never built it on trust
I say you're part of a lost generation
You got left in the dust
You never stopped for a red light
You never even tried
You're on the wrong side of midnight
Too fast to live, but you're too young to die
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
Keep on singing the blues
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
You've got nothing to lose
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
Keep on singing the blues
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
You've got nothing to lose
Yeah, nothing to lose
You never stopped for a red light
You never even tried
You're on the wrong side of midnight
Too fast to live, but you're too young to die
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
Keep on singing the blues
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
You've got nothing to lose
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
Keep on singing the blues
Keep on rockin' and rollin'
You've got nothing to lose
(Keep on rockin' and rollin'.)
You've got nothing
(Keep on rockin' and rollin'.)
No, no, you've got nothing to lose
(Keep on rockin' and rollin'.)
Nothing, nothing, nothing
(Keep on rockin' and rollin'.)
You've got nothing to lose
(Keep on rockin' and rollin'.)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Keep on singing the blues.)
Nothing to lose
(Keep on rockin' and rollin'.)
Wooh
(Keep on singing the blues.)
You've got nothing to lose
(Keep on rockin' and rollin'.)
Nothing, nothing, nothing
(Keep on singing the blues.)
You've got nothing to loseEmbed
