Listen to Your Heartbeat LyricsOutside the rain is falling
Inside it feels so cold
A view from a broken window
Faces that look so old
Every trick in the book you have tried
To make ends meet
Just remember those nights that you cried
There was nothing to do, but lie awake and
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Outside the rain is falling
Inside you feel so cold
A view from a broken window
Faces that have grown so old
Every trick in the book you have tried
To make ends meet
Just remember those nights that you cried
There was nothing to do, but lie awake and
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
You thought the mourning served out years ago
There's no more records on the radio
No place to go
Every trick in the book you have tried
To make ends meet
But just remember the nights that you cried
There was nothing to do, but lie awake and
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Listen to your heartbeat
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Listen to your heartbeatEmbed
