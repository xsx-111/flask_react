Military Man LyricsMama take a look at your boy
He's a military man
Mama take a look at your boy
He's crying
Mama take a look at your boy
He's a soldier
Mama take a look in his eyes
They're colder
Mama take a look at your boy
He's a military man
Mama take a look at your boy
He's dying
Mama take a look at your boy
He's fighting
Mama take a look at your boy
He's frightened
They have trained your boy to kill
And kill some day he will
They have trained your boy to die
And ask no questions why
Mama take a look at your boy
Take a look at your boy
Take a look at your boy
He's a killer, yeah
Mama take a look at your boy
Take a look at him now
Take a look at your boy
He's a soldier, he's colder, he's older, mama
Mama take a look at your boy
Obey the order
Mama take a look at your boy
Like a lamb to slaughter
They have trained your boy to kill
And kill some day he will
They have trained your boy to die
And ask no questions why
One day I will write for you a lovesong, mother
As the children say: "I love you", please hold me
And you and I, we will live our life together
Until that day when we die, I will love you, mother
I will always love you
I am writing from this war
Oh mama, I don't know what I'm fighting for
And if you see my children?
God bless them, kiss them
And tell them that I miss them
See I'm frightened in the dark
Mama, mama
The blood is ankle deep
They have trained your boy to kill
And kill someday he will
They have trained your boy to die
Papa take a look at your boy
Take a look at your boy
Take a look at your boy
He's marching
He's a soldier
Oh mama, oh mama
He's on the street
He's marching to the backbeatEmbed
