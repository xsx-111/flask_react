Once in a Lifetime LyricsI never met a woman
Who could make me feel the way you do
'Cause when I look into your eyes
You don't know what I'm going through
I was looking for someone to turn to
Something I'd never had before
And then you came into my life
Now I can open any door
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you
I never met a girl before
Who could understand a man like me
'Cause when I hold you in my arms
I just know that this was meant to be
I was looking for some understanding
Something I'd never had before
And then you came into my life
Now I can open any door
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you
Once in a lifetime
Just once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
I was looking for someone to turn to
Something I'd never had before
And then you came into my life
Now I can open any door
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you
Once in a lifetime
That I could ever find someone like you
Just once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetime
Once in a lifetimeEmbed
