Empty Rooms LyricsLoneliness is your only friend
A broken heart that just won't mend is the price you pay
It's hard to take when love grows old
The days are long and the nights turn cold when it fades away
You hope that she will change her mind
But the days drift on and on
You'll never know the reason why - she's gone
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
You see her face in every crowd
You hear her voice but you're still proud so you turn away
You tell yourself that you will be strong
But your heart tells you - this time you're wrong
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
You hope that she will change her mind
But the days drift on and on
You'll never know the reason why - she's gone
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms - where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms - where we learn
