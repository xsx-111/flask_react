Murder in the Skies LyricsTime was running out for all on board
Soaring up through the shadows of night
High above the clouds the engines roared
This would be their final flight
The russians have shot down a plane on its way to Korea
Two hundred and sixtynine innocent victims have died
Murder in the skies came without a warning
Murder in the skies, black September morning
Murder in the skies
Time was running out for everyone
Flying over the Sea of Japan
None would live to see the rising sun
Death was following close at hand
The russians have shot down a plane on its way to Korea
Two hundred and sixtynine innocent victims have died
Murder in the skies came without a warning
Murder in the skies, black September morning
Murder in the skies came without a warning
Murder in the skies, black September morning
Murder in the skies came without a warning
Murder in the skies, black September morning
Murder in the skies came without a warning
Murder in the skies, black September morning
Murder in the skies
Murder in the skies
Murder in the skies
Murder, murder in the skies
Murder in the skiesEmbed
