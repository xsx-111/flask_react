Still in Love with You LyricsI think I'll fall to pieces
If I don't find somethin' else to do
This sadness never ceases
Woman, I'm still in love with you
My head it keeps on reelin'
It's got me in a crazy spin
Ooh, darlin', darlin', darlin', darlin'
Is this the end?
I'm still in love with you
Some people say time has a way of healing
And it can dry all the tears from your eyes
Oh, but darlin' they don't tell you 'bout this empty feelin'
And I cannot disguise it
After all that we've been through
I try my best, but it's no use
I will always keep on lovin' you
Is this the end?
I'm still in love with you
And now that it's all over
Woman, there is somethin' I think you should know
And maybe baby, you might think it over
Just one more time before you go
Call on me baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Call on me baby, baby
Help me see it through
I'm still in love with youEmbed
