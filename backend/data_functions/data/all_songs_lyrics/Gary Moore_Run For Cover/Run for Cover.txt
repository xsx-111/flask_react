Run for Cover LyricsRun - run - run - run
Run, you'd better find somewhere to run
You think you're foolin' everybody
But you're not foolin' anyone
Hide, you always need some place to hide
But you can't hide from what's inside yourself
You just can't face it
Run, run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
You'd better find some other place to hide
The loneliness inside
You'd better run
Run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
Before it gets too late
Run, you're gonna run right out of time
You've let yourself fall way behind now
And all the years have passed you by
Lies, I used to listen to your lies
But now I've learned to read between the lines
I've got your number
Run, run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
You'd better find some other place to hide
The loneliness inside
You'd better run
Run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
Before it gets too late
Yeah
Run, run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
You'd better find some other place to hide
The loneliness inside
You'd better run
Run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
You'd better find some other place to hide
What's eating you inside
You'd better run
Run for cover now
You'd better run for cover now
Yeah
Run for cover
Run - run - run - run
Run - run - run - run
Run - run - run - run
Yeah, yeahEmbed
