One LyricsYou're in charge
You always were
There's no denying
Fire burns
I took alot
But now i'm gonna give
Back to you
Whatever i got
Cos we are one
And we'll always be
You were born first
Forever connected to me
Connected to me
It's not always how you want it to be
We had no choice,oh desperately
I had to leave
Now i'm coming back
We had to see
You're white and i'm black
Cos we are one
And we'll always be
You were born first
Forever connected to me
Forever connected to me
Forever connected to one
And we'll always be
You were born first
Forever connected to me
Forever connected to me
Forever connected to meEmbed
