The World Is Mine LyricsInhale the joy
Inhale the fun
Now it's time for me to get on top
Of the world
Inhale the music and the warmth
The crowd is ready to bring me to the top
Of the world
(chorus)
Cause the world is mine
I won't stop this time
Cause the world is mine
And I'm feeling so divine
I'm part of this illusive show
Time for me to get on stage
Lights fade
Tomorrow you'll be at my feet
Saturated senses set me free
It's all I need
The world the world is mine
And I'm feeling so divineEmbed
