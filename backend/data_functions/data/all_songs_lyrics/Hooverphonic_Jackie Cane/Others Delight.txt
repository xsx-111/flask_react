Others Delight LyricsDoors lit up bright
Others delight
Drift off to another white
Why are you so out of sight
Knew you would leave
Your goal was more important than my grief
I used to love what I do
You left and took my passion with you
Where did I go wrong
You took the air out of my lungs
Slowly losing my pace
My mind and heart are out of phase
Where did I go wrong
I'm hearing our gong announcing
Our final round
It doesn't matter who wins
Or even who will begin to see
That you and I are one
Where did I go wrong
I'm hearing our gong announcing
Our final round
It doesn't matter who wins
Or even who will begin to see
That you and I are oneEmbed
