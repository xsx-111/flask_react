The Kiss LyricsSome say because it's over
We should be said but that's not true
'Cause death may seem something nasty
But it belongs to me and you
Don't try to avoid your destiny
Accept this kiss with dignity
In this embrace you'll find relief
Get rid of all your grief
Some say because it's over
We should be said but that's not true
'Cause death may seem something nasty
But it belongs to me and you
Don't try to avoid your destiny
Accept this kiss with dignity
In this embrace you'll find relief
Get rid of all your grief
Your grief
Some say because it's over
We should be
Some say because it's over
We should be
Some say because it's over
We should be
Some say because it's over
We should be
