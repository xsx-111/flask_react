Opium Lyrics(Why)
I wonder why you sigh
(There's no reason)
There's no reason for you to cry
(Don't)
Don't believe your own lies
(There's no reason)
There's no reason for you to sigh
(Music)
Music is opium for free
Try a little
Try to consume me
Music is Prozac for free
Don't get stuck in greed
Why
Why don't you dare to speak?
(Silence)
Silence will tighten our needs
(Happy)
Happiness is not for me
(Silence)
Silence will tighten our needs
(Music)
Music is opium for free
Try a little
Try to consume me
Music is Prozac for free
Don't get stuck in greed
(Music)
(Silence)
(Happy)
(Don't)
(Music)
(Silence)
(Happy)
(There's no reason)Embed
