Substitute (Live At Leeds) LyricsStage banter on Deluxe Edition only

(laughs) We'd like to play three hit singles from our past for you, and, uh—


Uh, we don't do that one, sorry. Well, three selected hit singles, the three easiest! Uh... there's "Substitute," which we like, very much—


Thank you! That was our first... #4. And, uh, "Happy Jack," which was our first—first #1 in Germany, (imitates German marching band music), and funny enough, our first big hit record in the States. And "I'm A  Boy," which according to the—

Thank you!—which according to the Melody Maker was our first #1 in England, I think for about half an hour. Alright, here we go, starting off with "Substitute"!

All right, could you stop that? Put them cigarettes up!


You think we look pretty good together
You think my shoes are made of leather
But I'm a substitute for another guy
I look pretty tall but my heels are high
The simple things you see are all complicated
Look bloody young, but I'm just back-dated, yeah
Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic Mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine-looking suit is really made out of sack

I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth
The north side of my town faced east, and the east was facing south
And now you dare to look me in the eye
Those crocodile tears are what you cry
It's a genuine problem, you won't try
To work it out at all you just pass it by, pass it by

Substitute me for him
Substitute my coke for gin
Substitute you for my mum
At least I'll get my washing done

Substitute your lies for fact
I can see right through your plastic Mac
I look all white, but my dad was black
My fine-looking suit is really made out of sackEmbed
