My Generation (Live at Leeds) Lyrics
People try to put us down (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Oh! Just be-c-c-c-cause we get around (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Things they do look awful c-c-cold (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Hope I die before I get old (talkin' 'bout my generation)
It's my generation
It's my generation baby
Why don't you all f-f-f-fade away (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Don't try to dig what we wha-what we all s-s-s-say (talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just talkin' 'bout my g-g-generation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation
It's my generation baby
Why don't you all fade away (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Don't try to dig what we what we all s-s-s-say (talkin' 'bout my generation)
I'm not trying to cause a b-b-big sensation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
Just talkin' 'bout my g-g-generation (talkin' 'bout my generation)
My generation
It's my generation baby
Yeah baby
Yeah I'm talkin' about it
Everybody
Whoa-oh-oh
My my m-my my
Oh 
See me, feel me, touch me, heal me
Listening to you, I get the music
Gazing at you, I get the heat
Following you, I climb a mountain
I get excitement at your feet
Right behind you, I see the millions
On you, I see the glory
From you, I get opinions
From you, I get the story

So so very long
Goodbye, goodbye
So so very long
Goodby, goodby, goodbye
Bye bye bye bye
Bye bye
Goodbye, goodbye
So long, so very long
So very long

Ooh yeah
My my my my my my

See me coming out to get you
Yeah, see me coming out to get you
So slow
Can you feel me
Coming out to touch you
