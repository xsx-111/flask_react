Fortune Teller Lyrics
Our first gig in England for a very long time... well, it seems like a long time. Actually, it's been about a month and a half, two months. And it's really great to play in England again. This is a—


We been over with the Germans, you know, ooh, ugh...

There was food poisoning in the sauerkraut!

They're very tough, actually. This one is a rock and roll song, done by a guy called Benny Spellman, I'm sure you've never heard of him, but I'm sure you've heard of The Rolling Stones, cos they done it—

The Merseybeats!

Ooh, yeah, The Merseybeats, they done it!


(laughing) And Wayne Fontana, he did it! And now we do it, it's one called "Fortune Teller."

And ours is the most important version!

I went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head
Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said, "Sonny, you feel kind of warm"
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said, "You're in love"

I said, "It could not be so
Not with all the girls I know"
She said, "When the next one arrives
Take a look into her eyes


I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies
I hurried right back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Said, "I didn't see nobody"
Why'd she made a fool out of me?
At last something shook me
As if it came down from above
While looking at the fortune teller
Now I'm in loveEmbed
