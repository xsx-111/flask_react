Heaven And Hell (live) Lyrics

Thank you!



On top of the sky is a place where you go
If you've done nothing wrong
If you've done nothing wrong
And down in the ground is a place where you go
If you've been a bad boy
If you've been a bad boy

In the place up above you grow feather wings
And you fly 'round and 'round
With a harp singing hymns
And down in the ground you grow horns and a tail
And you carry a fork
And moan and wail

Why can't we have eternal life
And never die
Never die?

Heaven, Heaven, Heaven and Hell!
I said heaven, Heaven and Hell, baby!
Yeah, Heaven, Heaven and Hell!
Yeah!
