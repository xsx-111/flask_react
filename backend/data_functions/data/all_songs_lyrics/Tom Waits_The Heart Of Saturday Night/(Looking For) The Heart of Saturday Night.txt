(Looking For) The Heart of Saturday Night LyricsWell you gassed her up, behind the wheel
With your arm on your sweet one in your Oldsmobile
Barrelin' down the boulevard
Looking for the heart of Saturday night
And you got paid on Friday, your pockets are jingling
Then you see the lights and you get all tingling
'Cause you're cruising with a six
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
Then you comb your hair, you shave your face
Trying to wipe out every trace
Of all the other days in the week
You know that this'll be the Saturday you're reaching your peak
Stopping on the red, you're going on the green
'Cause tonight will be like nothing you've ever seen
And you're barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
Tell me, is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzing?
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
Is it the barmaid that's smiling from the corner of her eye?
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
Makes it kind of quiver down in the core
'Cause you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
And now you're stumbling
You're stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night
You gassed her up and you're behind the wheel
With your arm around your sweet one in your Oldsmobile
Barreling down the boulevard
You're looking for the heart of Saturday night
Is it the crack of the pool balls, neon buzzing?
Telephone's ringing, it's your second cousin
And the barmaid is smiling from the corner of her eye
Magic of the melancholy tear in your eye
Makes it kind of special down in the core
And you're dreaming of them Saturdays that came before
It's found you stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday night
And you're stumbling
Stumbling onto the heart of Saturday nightEmbed
