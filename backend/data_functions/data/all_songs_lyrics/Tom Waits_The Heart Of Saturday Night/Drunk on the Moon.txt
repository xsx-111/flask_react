Drunk on the Moon LyricsTight slack-clad girls on the graveyard shift
'Neath the cement stroll, catch the midnight drift
Cigar-chewing Charlie in that newspaper nest
Grifting hot horse tips on who's running the best
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
And the moon's a silver slipper, it's pouring champagne stars
And Broadway's like a serpent pulling shiny top-down cars
Larimer is teeming with that undulated beat
As some Bonneville is screaming its way wildly down the street
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
Hearts flutter and race, the moon's on the wane
Tarts mutter their dream hopes the night will ordain
Come schemers and dancers, cherry delight
As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound, and it cuts through the night
And I've hawked all my yesterdays
Don't try and change my tune
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon2Embed
