San Diego Serenade LyricsI never saw the morning till I stayed up all night
I never saw the sunshine till you turned out the light
I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody until I needed the song
I never saw the white line till I was leaving you behind
I never knew I needed you until I was caught up in a bind now
I never spoke "I love you" till I cursed you in vain
I never felt my heart strings until I nearly went insane
I never saw the east coast until I moved to the west
I never saw the moonlight until it shone off of your breast
I never saw your heart until someone tried to steal, tried to steal it away
I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face
I never saw the morning till I stayed up all night
I never saw the sunshine till you turned out your love light, baby
I never saw my hometown till I stayed away too long
I never heard the melody until I needed the song1Embed
