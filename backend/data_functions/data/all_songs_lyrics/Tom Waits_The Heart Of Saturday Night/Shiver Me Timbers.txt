Shiver Me Timbers LyricsI'm leaving my family, I'm leaving all my friends
My body's at home, but my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines on a new front-page sky
My tears are salt water and the moon's full and high
And I know Martin Eden's gonna be proud of me now
And many before me who've been called by the sea
To be up in the crow's nest and singing my say
Shiver me timbers 'cause I'm a-sailing away
And the fog's lifting and the sand's shifting and I'm drifting on out
Old Captain Ahab, he ain't got nothing on me now
So swallow me, don't follow me, I'm traveling alone
Blue water is my daughter, I'm gonna skip like a stone
So please call my missus, gotta tell her not to cry
'Cause my goodbye is written by the moon in the sky
Hey, and nobody knows me, I can't fathom my staying
And shiver me timbers 'cause I'm a-sailing away
And the fog's lifting, the sand's shifting, I'm drifting on out
And old Captain Ahab, he ain't got nothing on me
So come on and swallow me, follow me, I'm traveling alone
Blue water is my daughter, I'm gonna skip like a stone
And I'm leaving my family, I'm leaving all my friends
My body's at home, but my heart's in the wind
Where the clouds are like headlines upon a new front-page sky
And shiver me timbers 'cause I'm a-sailing away1Embed
