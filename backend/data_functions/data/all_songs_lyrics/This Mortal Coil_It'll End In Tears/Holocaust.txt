Holocaust LyricsYour eyes are almost dead
Can't get out of bed
And you can't sleep
You're sitting down to dress
And you're a mess
You look in the mirror
You look in your eyes
Say you realize
Everybody goes, leaving those who fall behind
Everybody goes as far as they can, they don't just care
They stood on the stairs
Laughing at your errors
Your mother's dead
She said, "Don't be afraid"
Your mother's dead
You're on your own
She's in her bed
Everybody goes, leaving those who fall behind
Everybody goes as far as they can, they don't just care
You're a wasted face
A sad-eyed lie
You're a holocaustEmbed
