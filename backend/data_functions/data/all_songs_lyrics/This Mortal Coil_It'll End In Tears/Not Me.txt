Not Me LyricsIt may be as you say, I'll admit
But you don't sound convinced
Between the surface you and the surface me
You didn't touch me
It may be as well that
I didn't see the point
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
I suppose it's just hollow
No idea, no spark
When I thought that in order to survive
You need to touch me
All of the me's
It may be as well that
I didn't see the point
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me
You didn't touch me...Embed
