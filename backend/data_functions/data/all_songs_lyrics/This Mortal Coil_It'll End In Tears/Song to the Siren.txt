Song to the Siren Lyrics
On the floating shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
Till your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle
And you sang, "Sail to me
Sail to me; let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you"

Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you here when I was full-sail?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing, "Touch me not
Touch me not; come back tomorrow
Oh, my heartâ€”oh, my heart
Shies from the sorrow"

I'm as puzzled as a newborn child
I'm as riddled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers
Or should I lie with death, my bride?
Hear me sing, "Swim to me
Swim to me; let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you"3Embed
