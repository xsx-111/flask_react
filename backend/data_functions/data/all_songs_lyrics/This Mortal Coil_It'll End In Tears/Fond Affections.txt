Fond Affections Lyrics
Fond affections are never said
They're only sung in songs
I never was naive enough to know when I was wrong
There's no light at the end of it all
Let's all sit down and cry
There's no light at the beginning
Let's all sit down and cry

Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's being forced upon you
It's just that person by your side remaining distant

Now the winter's growing close
The days are getting older
I can tell by your face
That your heart is getting colder
There's no light at the end of it all
Let's all sit down and cry
There's no light at the beginning
Let's all sit down and cry2Embed
