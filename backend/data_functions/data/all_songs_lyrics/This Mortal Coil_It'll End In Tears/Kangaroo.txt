Kangaroo LyricsI first saw you
You had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide anything
I saw you breathing
And I saw you staring out in space
I next saw you
It was at a party
Thought you was uncool
Oh so flirty
I came against
You didn't say excuse
Knew what I was doing
We looked very fine
As we were leaving
That Saint Joan
Doing a cool, cool jerk
Oh, I want you
Oh, I want you
Like a kangarooEmbed
