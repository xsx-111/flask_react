Drive Car Girl LyricsHey!
You're just a little shy
There's something in your eyes
You could have any guy
If you only stick around a while
Yet you drive that boy around
Drive that boy around
Drive that boy around
You could teach the birds to sing
With the power you're denying
You could have everything
It only takes a little trying
Yet you drive that boy around
Drive that boy around
Drive that boy around
Ba ba ba da da da
Ba da da da
It must be something deep
That keeps you pushing aside
He doesn't even bother to read
What's held behind your eyes
He's too busy making up lies
Still you drive that boy around
Drive that boy around
You could be driving this boy around
You could be driving this boy aroundEmbed
