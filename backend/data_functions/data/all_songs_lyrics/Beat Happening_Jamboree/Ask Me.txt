Ask Me LyricsDon't know I feel today
I feel the same as yesterday
Five hands crawling up my back
Thump, thump had a heart attack
And oh, hey, well okay
Aren't you gonna ask me what I did today?
I'm goin' up and down
Hit the ground
Black and white
Why can't it be right?
And oh, hey, well okay
Aren't you gonna ask me what I did today?
Got a pumpkin and a tree
And ideas all flowery
You got a joke, a smoke
And punctuation
But not enough time for conversation
And oh, hey, well okay
Aren't you gonna ask me what I did today?Embed
