Hangman LyricsThere's a little village near the center of Spain
Where a jealous brother killed a cold-blooded Cain
They had a dirty job that had to be done
When they asked for takers, there was only one
Cause I'm the hangman, yeah, hangman
I'm the hangman, hangman, hangman...
I wake at four, wash my hands
Drink to my god, atone for my sins
Walk out to the yard, test the rope
When the dawn breaks, I start to work
Cause I'm the hangman, yeah, hangman
I'm the hangman; cause I'm the hangman...
Hangman...
Make peace with yourself, cause I'm the hangman
Hangman, yeah, the hangman, hangman..
Feel no guilt, I feel no shame
I return to my family at the end of the day
Sit and watch my son while he's out at play
When he grows to be a man, he'll be just like me
He'll be a hangman. I'm the hangman, yeah, hangman
I'm the hangman, hangman...Embed
