Cat Walk LyricsI look at them out together
And I see she's wearing my sweater
Ah, what the heck, I might as well let her
I was hardly gone
Before another boy came along
Not to say that that is wrong
But I wish she'd leave my sweater home
I look at them out together
I don't mind he's an okay fella
Anyway, it's probably better
She isn't stuck with me
I'm so bad at the intrigue
I'm glad I'm not stuck with her
She's got a bad habit of being pure
I look at them out together
I wonder why I always upset her
I think to myself what does it matter
I wonder now what does it matter?
I wonder now what does it matter?
Does it matter?Embed
