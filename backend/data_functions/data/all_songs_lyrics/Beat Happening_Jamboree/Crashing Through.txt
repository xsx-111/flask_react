Crashing Through Lyrics
Backburner is on fire
Freeze, dry clean, then retire
Yeah, yeah, that cockroach overdue
Yeah, yeah, gotta get a new haircut too
Yeah, yeah, who says dreams don't come true?
Woah, woah, got a new thing crashing through

Set work top over tower
Hope your new job don't go sour
Yeah, yeah, backseat stab over jewel
Yeah, yeah, heard 'bout that on the news
Yeah, yeah, can't stop that lopsy-do
Woah, woah, got a new thing crashing through

Push cart that won't go
Catch ball then overthrow
Yeah, yeah, that's old school
Yeah, yeah, that's overdue
Yeah, yeah, skip that too
Woah, woah, got a new thing crashing through
Woah, woah, got a new thing crashing through
Woah, woah, got a new thing crashing through
Got a new thing crashing throughEmbed
