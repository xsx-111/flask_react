Midnight A Go-Go LyricsDon't you mind that daily grind
Cause I walk down the side streets too
Nine to five where they live their lives
Never knowing what the night looks to you
Hey girl, come with me
We're on our own, can't you see
The world is different, we're outside
Take a step midnight a go-go tonight
Take a step midnight a go-go tonight
Take a step midnight a go-go tonight
Take a step midnight a go-go tonight
L7 can have the day
They'll never take the night time away
Midnight a go-go, yeah yeah
Is when we come out to play
Hey girl, come with me
We'll stop the world, then let it go free
I need to know what's in your mind
We'll touch our souls, then leave them behind
Hey girl, come with me
We'll stop the world, then let it go free
I need to know what's in your mind
We'll touch our souls, then leave them behind
Ah, midnight a go-go, yeah yeah
Ah, midnight a go-go, yeah yeah
Ah, midnight a go-go, yeah yeah
Midnight a yeah yeah, go goEmbed
