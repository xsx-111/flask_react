Bewitched LyricsI see you hanging the crowd, staring me down
With that ice cream cone, still I'm all alone
You've got me caught, let go my heart
Or give me a sign that you'll be mine
I got a crush on you, got a crush on you
You won't let me through, I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you, got a crush on you
What am I to do? I got a crush on you
I saw you flying the plane, driving me insane
Hit me with a bone till I'm all alone
You driving that car, saw his arms
Saw that black as tar, must be your heart
I got a crush on you, I got a crush on you
What am I to do? I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you, got a crush on you
Making me so blue, I got a crush on you
Pandora's box has got a lock
I'm gonna knock, gonna beat the clock
I won't rest until Pandora's chest
Has been upset because I'm the one
I got a crush on you, got a crush on you
You won't let me through, I got a crush on you
I got a crush on you, got a crush on you
Got a crush on you, I got a crush on you
I can't relax, old Mister Scratch
Is on my back, made a devil's pact
Trade an old black cat for a witches brew
Seven, seven sins and you
I got a crush on you, I got a crush on you
You won't let me through, I got a crush on you
Got a crush on you, making me so blue
I got a crush on you, what am I to do?
Got a crush on you
Crush
You
And youEmbed
