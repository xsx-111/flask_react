I Want You LyricsYeah
I can see your darkened eyes
Across the room turn
Into lies and laughter
And asking for my name again
Then introduced
As just a friend
Well, it was no fantasy
The passion burned
You touched me, the evening
Turned to midnight
I can't forget the naked trust
One quenchless night
Of shaking lust and fire
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
Since that night
I'm not the same
Desire breeds
An ugly stain inside me
Satisfaction never comes
It's always dark
And yet still I run
Oh... even when I close my eyes
You torture me with
Ahameless sighs of seduction
And waking in a chilling sweat
Pounding heart inside my chest
I'm screaming
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
Hey...
Oh, with your heart in your fist
You laugh at my situation
Tell me, is it blood that you want?
Then take me strip me cut me
See, I'm bleeding
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
Hey, hey
I want you
I want you
Oh... yeahEmbed
