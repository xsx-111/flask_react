Chrome Plated Heart LyricsI got a chrome-plated heart
Wings on these fingers
Trying to tear it apart
Got angels crying
From up above
And they got rust in their eyes
They got rust on their love
But I have learned
To leave no stone unturned
And keep the wall
Against my back
And the love is real
As the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night
I got a two dollar stare
Midas in my touch
And Delilah in my hair
I got bad intentions
On the soles of my shoes
With this red hot fever
And these chromium blues
And I will feel
Another lovers wheel
And drive for miles
And not look back
And the love is real
As the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night
And I'll dance in time
And the times are rough
And I'll pay the price
And I'll pray that it's enough
And just outside the door
Where it always rains
I'll take the time to polish
These scratches and these stains
On my chrome plated heart
Wings on these fingers
Trying to tear it apart
I got angels crying
From up above
And they got rust in their eyes
They got rust on their love
And the only way I know
Where the train will go
Is when I'm sleeping
On the tracks
And the love is real
As the day is long
And the night is black
As black as night
The night is black
As black as night
Chrome-plated heart
