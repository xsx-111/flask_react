Occasionally Lyrics
I saw you with your new friends
You wear them so well
Broken shoes and loose ends
Gee, you look swell
Me, I'm drinking too much coffee
And I'm smoking cigarettes
I'm a deputy of habit
I just can't forget

I'm only lonely when I'm driving in my car
I'm only lonely after dark
I'm only lonely when I watch my TV
I'm only lonely occasionally

I saw you with your envoy
A consenting adult
Technique in moderation
Vogue to the cult, mmm
Me I've got my strangers
To exile in the night
I guess I'm just addicted
To the pain of delight
I'm only lonely when I'm driving in my car
I'm only lonely after dark
I'm only lonely when I watch my TV
I'm only lonely occasionally
Occasionally
