Similar Features Lyrics
Go on and close your eyes
Go on imagine me there
She got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Go on and close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you

You never had to wait
For nothing in your life
I guess wanting me must have been
A steel blue knife
And when night after night
The scent of passion would linger
You had to have the jewels
Wrapped around your finger
Now you keep running down the road
In your midnight state of mind
Curiosity kills
If you can't read the signs

Go on and close your eyes
Imagine me there
She got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Go on and close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you
Dancing with the wall
Made you bitter and sweet
There ain't much you can do
When they just lay it at your feet
But could you tell by the song
I wanted to be the one?
Did you listen again
When the damage was done?
Now the paint's still wet
In your do-it-by-number dream
Are you gonna tell me how it felt?
Will you tell me what it means?

Go on and close your eyes
Go on imagine me there
She got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Go on and close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you

Was it want with no desire?
Was it smoke with no fire?
Did I say it doesn't rip me apart? I lied
I'm sorry dear, my hands are tied
Go on and close your eyes
Go on imagine me there
She got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Go on and close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you
Close your eyes
Imagine me there
She's got similar features
With longer hair
And if that's what it takes
To get you through
Close your eyes
It shouldn't bother you

Shouldn't bother you
Yeah
Shouldn't bother you
Yeah
It shouldn't bother you
Shouldn't bother youEmbed
