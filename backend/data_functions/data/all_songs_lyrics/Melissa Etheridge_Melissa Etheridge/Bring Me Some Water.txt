Bring Me Some Water Lyrics
Tonight I feel so weak
But all in love is fair
I turn the other cheek
And I feel the slap and the sting
Of the foul night air
And I know
You're only human
And I haven't got
Talking room
But tonight while I'm making excuses
Some other woman
Is making love to you

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive?
Can't you see my baby's
Got another lover?
I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see it's out of control?
Baby's got my heart
And my baby's got my mind
But tonight the sweet Devil
Sweet Devil's got my soul
When will this aching pass?
When will this night be through?
I want to hear the breaking glass
I only feel the steel
Of the red hot truth
And I'd do anything
To get it out of my mind
I need some insanity
Of that temporary kind
Tell me how will I ever be the same
When I know that woman
Is whispering your name

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive?
Can't you see my baby's
Got another lover?
And I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water
Can't you se it's out of control?
Baby's got my heart
And my baby's got my mind
But tonight the sweet Devil
Sweet Devil's got my soul
Oh... Devil's got my soul

Somebody bring me some water
Can't you see I'm burning alive?
Can't you see my baby's
Got another lover?
And I don't know how I'm gonna survive
Somebody bring me some water
Can't you se it's out of control?
Baby's got my heart
And my baby's got my mind
But tonight the sweet Devil
Sweet Devil's got my soul
Oh, no
Oh...
Baby's got my heart
And my baby's got my mind
But tonight the sweet Devil
Sweet Devil's got my soul1Embed
