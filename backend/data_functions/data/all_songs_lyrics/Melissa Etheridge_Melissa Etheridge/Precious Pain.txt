Precious Pain Lyrics
Everybody's got a hunger
No matter where they are
Everybody clings to their own fear
Everybody hides some scar

Ooh, precious pain
Empty and cold but it keeps me alive
I gave it my soul so that I could survive
Keeping me safe in these chains
Precious pain

Everybody's got a reason
To abandon their plan
How can I think of tomorrow
With my sorrow in hand?

Ooh, precious pain
Empty and cold but it keeps me alive
I gave it my soul so that I could survive
Keeping me safe in these chains
Precious pain
Each road that I walk down
Reminds me of you
This whole town is haunted
There'll never be anything new

Precious pain
Empty and cold keeps me alive
I gave it my soul so that I could survive
Keeping me safe in these chains
Precious pain

Oh
Oh oh
Oh
Ah
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh
Ah ah
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo
Ooh ohEmbed
