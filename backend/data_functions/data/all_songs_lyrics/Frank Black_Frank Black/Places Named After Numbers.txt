Places Named After Numbers LyricsBeyond below above
A gravity that slumbers
At the center of
Places named after numbers
A different kind of love
She was right
She was right there
She was right there all the time
Collapsing all the way
And though it seems from here
That she was never there
Light beams disappear
Into her blackened hair
I wonder if they reappear
She was right
She was right there
She was right there all the time
Collapsing all the wayEmbed
