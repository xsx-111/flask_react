Fu Manchu LyricsYou heard about
A criminal man of virtue
Is there any doubt
His minimal strands would suit you?
Is a hard earned way
Is a hard earned way
I'll never lose
My fu manchu, my fu manchu
Let them grow out
In time you'll feel so better
The vanishing pout
Now you're a real go-getter
Is a hard earned way
Is a hard earned way
I'll never lose
My fu manchu, my fu manchu
Is a hard earned way
Is a hard earned way
Occidentally tic-tac
