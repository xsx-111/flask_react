Two Spaces LyricsThis gravity
Is feeling like a tether
I want to want to be
So high above the weather
All frequency around
Round, round, round, round
Without a sound
And there's today
And there's two spaces
And too many places
Not to go to, ooh
This big old sea
Is feeling like a pleasure
I look cautiously
At all the falling treasure
With some frequency it comes down
Down, down, down, down
Without a sound
And there's today
And there's two spaces
And too many places
Not to go to, oohEmbed
