Adda Lee LyricsI'm a wishbone
And I'm breaking
Yeah, I'm wishing for Adda Lee
And the lake sings
And the dogs don't
They are quiet for Adda Lee
Adda Lee
I'm sorry and I miss you
And away I went away
'Cause I wished I was away
I wished I was away
A wishing well
Of well wishing
And Adda waves away
Adda waves away
Heroine of the stars
I don't know where I am
But I know who you are
Adda Lee
Adda Lee
And she whispered
And she left me a man
For the world
Oh, Adda Lee
Oh, Adda Lee
Oh, Adda LeeEmbed
