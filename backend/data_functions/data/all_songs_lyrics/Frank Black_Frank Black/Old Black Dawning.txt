Old Black Dawning LyricsI hung around
On the planet Mabel
She tried to stand
But she was not able
She tried to find the truth
She tried to colonize space
She only had a few
But it was a good race
Old black dawning is coming on
Old black dawning is coming on
Old black dawning
Old black dawning
I'm always happy to
Go down to old Tucson
After you had your fun
It's time to move on
I've got a favorite story
About the Tower of Babel
Some say it's true
And some say it's a fable
Old black dawning is coming on
Old black dawning is coming on
Old black dawning
Old black dawningEmbed
