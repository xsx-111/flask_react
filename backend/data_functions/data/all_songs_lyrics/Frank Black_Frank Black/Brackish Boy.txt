Brackish Boy LyricsThis man he was a Mexican, oh yeah
Adopted into Norwegian, oh yeah
Turned into American, oh yeah
But he felt a Mexican, oh yeah
He was a walking fish, oh yeah
Down Mexico way
He had to learn Spanish, oh yeah
He was a walking fish, oh yeah
He was feeling so brackish
Between Norwegian and English
He decided it was time to go
To find the people that he did not know
But the road to Mexico, oh yeah
They sure go fast but they should go slow, oh yeah
It's a dangerous road, oh
By now you know that he was fucked
By now you know he had no luck
He was smashed head on by a giant truck
Down Mexico wayEmbed
