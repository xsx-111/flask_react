Hang on to Your Ego LyricsI know so many people
Who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads
And stay in the safety zone
But what can you tell them?
What can you say that won't make them defensive?
So...
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day
And waste all their thoughts at night
But how can I say it?
How can I come on when I know I'm guilty?
So...
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
And how can I say it?
How can I come on when I know I'm guilty?
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fightEmbed
