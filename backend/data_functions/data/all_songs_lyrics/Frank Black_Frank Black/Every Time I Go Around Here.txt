Every Time I Go Around Here LyricsEvery time I go around here
I see tumbles
Gone is the regal automobile
And ever since I'm down, I'm down
We used to ride in it
In this frozen town
Any time we had in the time we had
We found, we found
In this frozen place
Parked half off the ground
Every time I go around here
I see tumbles
Through my head and the glass cleared
And the motor rumbled
I don't know if it's good that they did make the wheel
But ever since I know, I know
I've been rolling on
Rolling on to you
Any time we have in the time we have
We'll go, we'll go
To that frozen place
Frozen place that we knew
Every time I go around here
I see tumbles
Through my head and the glass cleared
And the motor rumbled
Every time I go around here
I see tumbles
Through my head and the glass clearedEmbed
