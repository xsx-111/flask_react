Above the Clouds LyricsAutumn blew its leaves at me
Threatening winter as I walked
Summer always goes so quick
Barely stopping like my thoughts
Which dip and spin and change so fast
I have to wonder, Will I last?
Through the windows of the train
I caught reflections of a paper cup
Hanging small on a pale blue sky
Never knowing which way's up
Above the clouds
What's to be found
I have to wonder
Will I be around?
As my anger shouts
At my own self doubt
So a sadness creeps
Into my dreams
When you're scared of living
But afraid to die
I get scared of giving
And I must find the faith to beat it
It must be me that's rushing by
Time just lingers on the wind
Bristlin' through my open fears
I wonder what it's going to bring
Above the clouds
What's to be found
I have to wonder
Will I be around?
Run and hide, run and hide
I'll catch the sail at evening tideEmbed
