Uh Huh Oh Yeh LyricsI took a trip down Boundary Lane, try an' find myself again
At least a part I left somewhere, buried under a hedgerow near
A lazy bridge on a hot afternoon, water glistens while it plays a tune
Cloudburst on a rainy day, wiping all my sleep away
Uh huh oh yeh! Uh huh oh yeh! Always there to confuse and fool ya!
Uh huh oh yeh! Uh huh oh yeh! Always there to confuse and fool ya!
And in my mind I saw the place, as each memory returned to trace
Dear reminders of who I am, the very roots upon which I stand
And there they were for all to see, my long-lost used to be's
And all the dreams I had to dream, were really something, not make-believe
Uh huh oh yeh! Uh huh oh yeh! Always there to confuse and fool ya!
Uh huh oh yeh! Uh huh oh yeh! Always there to confuse and fool ya!
A lazy tree by a wishing well, I wish now that I could tell
If all the dreams I used to dream, are really something or make-believe
Uh huh oh yeh! Uh huh oh yeh! Always there to confuse and fool ya!
Uh huh oh yeh! Uh huh oh yeh! Always there to confuse and fool ya!Embed
