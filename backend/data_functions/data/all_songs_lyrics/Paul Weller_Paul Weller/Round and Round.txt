Round and Round LyricsTell us if our future's far
If our future's far
Tell us if our future's far
If our future's far
Tell us if our future's far
If our future's far
Tell us if our future's far
If our future's far
Tell us if our future's far
If our future's far
Only surface, just skin deep
When words fly like angels around your feet
Need the something, feel real inside
Cling together, as together we ride
Round and round and up and down
Here we go in this moment in time
Round and round and up and down
Here we go again, yeah
Tell us if our future's far
If our future's far
Movin' up to collect our prizes
Sinkin' fast into life's surprises
Win today but lose tomorrow
Lendin' what we just can't borrow
Round and round
Up and down
Here we go
Round and round and up and down
Here we go again, yeah
Tell us if our future's far
If our future's far
Time around us, time to live
Gettin' back everything we give
Freedoms truth is the only truth
To save the day and pave the route
Be the first one on your block
To know the time and own a clock
Whose hands point upwards to the stars
To tell us if our future's far
Our future's far
Tell us if our future's far
Round and round and up and down
Here we go in this moment in time
Round and round and up and down
Here we go again
Round and round and up and down
Here we go in this moment in time
Round and round and up and down
Here we go again, ohh
Tell us if our future's far
If our future's farEmbed
