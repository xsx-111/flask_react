Bull-Rush LyricsIn a momentary lapse of my condition
That sent me tumbling down into a deep despair
Lost and dazed so I had no real recollection
Until the rain cleared the air
When you wake to find that everything has left you
And the clothes you wear belong to someone else
See your shadow chasing off towards the shoreline
Drifting into emptiness
There are bullrushes outside my window
And their leaves whisper words in the breeze
Well tomorrow I'll walk to the harbour
And catch the first boat that's coming in
I'll catch the first boat that's coming in
Like a child too small to reach the front door handle
Or maybe just too scared to know what I would find
Now I feel I'm strong enough to take a slow ride
Now knowing when I will arrive
There are bullrushes outside my window
And their leaves whisper words in the breeze
Well tomorrow I'll walk to the harbour
And catch the first boat that's coming in
I'll catch the first boat that's coming in
I do believe I'm going home
'Cos I don't call this place my own
I'm missing what I had, happy times and sad
More than I ever thought could be
Not knowing when I will arrive
There are bullrushes outside my window
And their leaves whisper words in the breeze
Well tomorrow I'll walk to the harbour
And catch the first boat that's coming in
I'll catch the first boat that's coming in
I'll catch the first boat that's coming inEmbed
