Always There to Fool You LyricsI took a trip down boundary lane
Try an' find myself again
At least a part I left somewhere
Buried under a hedgerow near
A lazy bridge on a hot afternoon
Water glistening while it plays a tune
Cloudburst on a rainy day
Wiping all my sleep away
Uh huh oh yeah, uh huh oh yeah
Always there to confuse and fool you
And in my mind I saw the place
As each memory returned to trace
Dear Reminders of who I am
The very roots upon which I stand
And there they were for all to see
My long lost used-to-beâ€™s
And all the dreams I had to dream
Were really something, not make believe
A lazy tree by a wishing well
I wish now that I could tell
If all the dreams I used to dream
Are really something, not make believeEmbed
