Everything Has a Price to Pay LyricsHere is the tune I've been writing -
It's been so long in the making
I hope it's worth all the waiting
Not expect it all for free
Everything has one ending -
Everything has it's day
There's no use in pretending -
Yes, everything has a price to pay
You just asked me, what I'm feeling
Should I tell you?
Nothing is for free
Can't you see - can't you see?
Everything has a price to pay
Everything that I know is -
Hanging on my melody
Everything has an ending
Yes, everything has a price to pay
You just asked me, what I'm feeling
Should I tell you?
Nothing is for free
Can't you see - can't you see?
Everything has a price to pay
Here is the tune I've been writing -
It's been so long in the making
I hope it's worth all the waiting
Yes, everything has a price to payEmbed
