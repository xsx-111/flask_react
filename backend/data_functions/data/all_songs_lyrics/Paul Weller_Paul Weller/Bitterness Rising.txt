Bitterness Rising LyricsUnfit to live in, just about fit to burst
Like the banks of a swollen river, as bitterness does its worst
Working on your feelings, eating you all up
You have to shed that shit to move on, let love carry you on up
(It's just) bitterness rising, taking you off
Bitterness rising, you gotta shake those feelings off
Unfair to give in and never change its course
If you have the choice before you, you must take it with a force
Or the past will take you, keep you from the truth
As bitterness rises from the ashes of your youth
(It's just) bitterness rising, taking you off
Bitterness rising, you gotta shake those feelings off
Moments in time, finding the space, to be what'cha wanna be
The things you never got, life you never had
The dreams that you once dreamed
Waiting your time, finding the space, to be what'cha wanna be
Well just be!
Or the past will take you, keep you from the truth
As bitterness rises from the ashes of your youth
(It's just) bitterness rising, taking you off
Bitterness rising, you gotta shake those feelings offEmbed
