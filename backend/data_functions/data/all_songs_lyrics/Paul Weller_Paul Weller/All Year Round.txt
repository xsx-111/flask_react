All Year Round LyricsOur eyes meet across the floor
We don't have to say much more
Lets take a chance on it
Say you'll be mine till Spring
We kiss on crowded streets
We kiss everytime we meet
Who knows how it will go
Stay here till summer comes
I love you more each day God sends
Love you because you are my friend
Oh, don't say our luck has blown
Oh stick with it till autumn goes
Lets make love in the light
Sleep together every night
Oh, with dark days all about
Oh, lets stay together, see the winter outEmbed
