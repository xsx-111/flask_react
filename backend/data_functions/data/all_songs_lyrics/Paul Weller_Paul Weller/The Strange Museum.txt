The Strange Museum LyricsCome on in, admission's free
I won't refuse those who wanna see
Bring your loved ones, those you hold dear
Bring them all, there's no restrictions here
But don't look for blame as an easy escape
There's nothing on show that isn't your shame
So come on in, it's a small price to pay
And I won't refuse those who've lost their wayEmbed
