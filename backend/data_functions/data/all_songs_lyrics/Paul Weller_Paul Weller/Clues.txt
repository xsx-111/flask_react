Clues LyricsI'll meet'cha on a bus at dawn, an open top one if it's warm
And if the flowers are in bloom, I'll lose myself to you
I'll be whistling down a street, you'll hear our footsteps start to meet
Then the craziness begins
An' like chalk and cheese, yeh we'll shoot the breeze
Yeh, headed up west in an open top deck
Oh trying to remember just what for
Then we'll talk for hours and hours about nothing much at all
With your long hair falling down, falling down, in curl after curl
And I too shy to ask what I really want to do
Racked with my own self doubt, I stumble and fall
Like a fool in love, my mind in the air
Heaven knows where, yeh, heading up west in an open top deck
Trying to remember just what forEmbed
