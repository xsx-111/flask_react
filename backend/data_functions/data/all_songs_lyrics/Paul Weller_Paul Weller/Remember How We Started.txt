Remember How We Started LyricsRemember how started on a summer's night
Too drunk to care about what might
You turned my head to kiss your lips
Time stood still as my heart skipped a beat
And if I could I'd take your hand and lead you off back to the past
I know a trail, a secret mile, an' better to cry than never smile
The moonlight shining through your flowered curtains
I think we knew it was us for certain
And just the thing that we hoped for
Was building up into something more
Oh I've been searching, searching
Trying to find the words to say
Oh I've been searching, searching
Trying to get back to the love we made ... yesterday
Remember how we started on a summer's night
Too young to know about what might
And just as well as we might not have started on this course at allEmbed
