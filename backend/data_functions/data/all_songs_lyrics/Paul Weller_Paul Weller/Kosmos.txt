Kosmos LyricsLife's complexities trouble your rise
As you attempt to ascend into the high
Is there nowhere else left to run
But to the Kosmos - men gaze - to look for heaven
Flying high - never come down
Flying high - don't know how to come down
Take a ride into the soon
Be the first one on the moon
Take a slide, come back to earth
It's to the Kosmos - men dare - to look for something
Flying high - never come down
Flying high - don't know how to come down
No time to spare - Destiny is here
No time to lose - better if we choose
Less time to share - people stop and stare
To look for hope above the clouds - to look for heaven
A world away, a million light years
That's how far destruction seems
Now our dreams are sad, slow creatures
Dying to know - who am I? What am I? Where am I to go?Embed
