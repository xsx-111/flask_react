Hell For Leather LyricsMake something happen, if you don't, I will
We might lose a lifetime looking for a thrill
Night is the jungle, a forbidden place
In the neon forest people vanish without trace
Midnight stay tight together
Greased-up and ready, a well-oiled machine
You're my motorcycle, I'm your gasoline
Spark my ignition, you hold the key
Won't you kick yourself in gear and ride away with me?
And I fell like Hell for leather
Hell for leather
Can't you tell it's forever?
Yeah, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey
Trapped in the city, you learn to save your skin
There ain't no human zoo could ever cage us in
The night is the jungle, but don't you lose your way
There's hungry creatures out there eager for some easy prey
And I fell like Hell for leather
Hell for leather
You can tell that it's forever
Forever, forever
Won't you ride away with me?
You can ride away with me
Ride away with me
