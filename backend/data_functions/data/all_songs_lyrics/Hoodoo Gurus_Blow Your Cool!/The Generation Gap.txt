The Generation Gap Lyrics
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah

When you see a little baby
See it lying in it's mother's lap
It's just the beginning of a thing called the generation gap
It's not the difference of age, now
Everybody's talking 'bout
It's all those no-no's that they call the generation gap

While the grown ups go out, now
They go to parties and get stoned
But that's something they don't talk about
In front of the children at home
But they ain't fooling anybody now
'Cause those kids are gonna find it out
Yeah, it's just another reason for a thing called the generation gap

Well the generation gap is a mighty, mighty big hole
And you ain't gonna fill it up with all those lies that's bein' told
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
You better shut your trap
If you expect to narrow the generation gap
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
Preacher says drinking is a sin
That we'll have to pay for
But tell me, what's that liquor bottle
Doing on the dash of his car?
And who's the man who calls Daddy
Every time that Mumma's out?
Well, do you still wonder why we have that generation gap?

The generation gap is a mighty, mighty big hole
And you ain't gonna fill it up with all those lies that's bein' told
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
You better shut your trap
If you want to help to close that generation gap
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah


The generation gap is a mighty, mighty big hole
And you ain't gonna fill it up with all those lies that's bein' told
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
You better button your lip
Or else you're gonna lose yourself on your own generation trip
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah, wah-wah, wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah
Wah-wah-wah-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Shut up!Embed
