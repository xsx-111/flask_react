On My Street LyricsWon't you visit my town?
Ain't too far, you just go eight miles underground
And take the diamond mine straight to my street
Everybody you know
Is dying to meet you, 'cause they all told me so
And Tojo booked you Hojo's bridal suite
Light a candle with a star
Turn around, and there you are
On my street (Hey-ey-ey)
You can drive no car (Hey-ey-ey)
Anybody could see
The Flying Doctor's been barking up the wrong tree
And Cecil B. DeMille lives on my street
I know C.Y. O'Connor's feeling depressed
And Gypsy Rose Lee is always under-dressed
While Liberace is playing with his feet

Light a candle with a star
Turn around, and there you are
On my street (Hey-ey-ey)
You can drive no car (Hey-ey-ey)
Fly Sinatra to the Moon
You'll be back by afternoon
On my street (Hey-ey-ey)
You can call the tune (Hey-ey-ey)
You can call the tune (Hey-ey-ey)
You can, yeah
Call it anythin'
Hey (Hey)
Oh, here she comes now
She's looking kinda tough
And feelin' kinda rough
She's on my street
You're on my street
You're on my street (Hey-ey-ey)
Hey, hey, hey, you're on my street (Hey-ey-ey)
Hey, hey, hey, you're on my street (Hey-ey-ey)
Hey, hey, hey, you're on my street (Hey-ey-ey)
Hey, hey, hey, you're on (Hey)
You're on my street (Hey)
Anytime you (Hey)
