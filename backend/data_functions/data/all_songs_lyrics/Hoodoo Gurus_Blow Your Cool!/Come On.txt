Come On LyricsOh, come on, I've been hanging out
Oh, come on, had some nagging doubts
Oh, come on, but that was until now
Oh, come on, you are all I want
All I want, how could I hold out for long?
Oh, come on, who cares what people say?
Oh, come on, 'cause we can sleep all day
Oh, come on, tonight won't keep away, let's just play
Oh, come on, how can we be wrong?
We're not wrong, when we both feel so strong
We're so strong (Come on)
We're so strong (Come on)
Come on, oh
Come on, the last train's almost gone
Really gone, let's enjoy the ride we're on
So come on, we can take our time
We can take walk the line, after all
So come on, 'cause it's you I love
Oh, come on, when push comes to shove
Oh, come on, you're more than enough
You're more than enough
Come on
Come on
