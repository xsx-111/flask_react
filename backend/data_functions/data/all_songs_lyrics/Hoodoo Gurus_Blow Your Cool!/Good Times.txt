Good Times Lyrics
You told me goodbye and I believed you
Felt like I would die, I didn't need to, no
'Cause you came back to me
And everything's like it used to be

All the good times we had
We'll have again (Times we had)
All the good times we had
We'll have again

If your love is mine it will stand up, hey
To the test of time, it will stand up
It looked like we were through
But in our heart of hearts we knew

The good times we had
We'll have again (Times we had)
All the good times we had
We'll have again and again
Now, I know you'll always be my friend
'Til the end
That means more to me than anything, hey
Ooh-hoo-ooh
Who needs yesterday? That's far behind us
It is, and memories only may serve to remind us
That what felt good before (Good before)
Today we'll treasure so much more

All the good times we had
We'll have again (Times we had)
All the good times we had (We'll have again)
And again, and again (Times we had)
(All the good times we had)
We'll have again (Times we had)
And again, now I know (All the good times we had)
That you'll always be my friend (We'll have again) (Times we had)
(All the good times we had)
(All the times we had) Woo-hoo
(Times we had)
(All the times we had)
(Times we had)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (All the good times we had)
(Times we had)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohEmbed
