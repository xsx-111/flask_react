Where Nowhere Is Lyrics
Do you know where nowhere is? It's where you are
Do you know what nothing means? Y-O-U
Do you know what no one thinks? It's all about you
And do you know what? Nobody cares

Well, you can't see the stars in the daytime
And you can't see the Sun when it's night
But you can't even see yourself in the mirror
And I can't see you at all, not at all

Do you know where (Nowhere)
Do you know where (Nowhere)
Do you know where (Nowhere)
Nowhere is?
Do you know where (Nowhere)
Do you know where (Nowhere)
Do you know where (Nowhere)
Nowhere is?
Hey

You had everything that you ever wanted
Man, you had it made, was what you had
You forgot the only thing you ever needed
And you can't hide, you can't hide, you can't hide
Not from me, not from me
No, no way
Hey
Hey
Come see now

Do you know (Nowhere)
(Nowhere)
(Nowhere)
Nowhere is?
Do you know (Nowhere)
Know (Nowhere)
Know (Nowhere)
Nowhere is?
Where nowhere
Do you know, know nowhere (Nowhere)
Do you know, know, know nowhere (Nowhere)
Do you know, nowhere (Nowhere)
Nowhere is?
No way, no way
It's right hereEmbed
