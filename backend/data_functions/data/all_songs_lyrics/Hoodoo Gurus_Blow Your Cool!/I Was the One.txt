I Was the One Lyrics
Darling, this is goodbye
Kiss me, I don't know why
You were always beautiful
When you closed your eyes

Leave now, while we still can
Let's not wait 'til it all gets out of hand
You're looking for a criminal
Well, I'm a guilty man

I was the one, I was the one
I was the one
I was the one, I was the one
I was the one

We were wrong from the start
Maybe we tried just a little too hard
You don't have to blame yourself
You always played your part

I was the one, I was the one
I was the one
I was the one, I was the one
I was the one
I was

Darling, look at us now
Look at us now
History won't put us down
Won't put us down
Don't let anybody say
You should have worked it out

I was the one, I was the one
I was the one
I was the one, I was the one
I was the one
I was the one, I was
I was the one
I was the one
I was the one, yeah


I wasEmbed
