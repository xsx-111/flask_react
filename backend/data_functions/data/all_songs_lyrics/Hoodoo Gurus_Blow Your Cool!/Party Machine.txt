Party Machine Lyrics
Well, it's Friday night and I just got paid
Nothing on tomorrow, man, I got it made

We got an engine, but we ain't got wheels
Don't need to petrol for our Guru-mobile
'Cause we ain't going nowhere near the ground
We're on a rocket ship to inner space (Inner space)
Gone into orbit moving in one place (In one place)
And going faster than the speed of sound, yeah

Move your feet to the rhythm of love
Groove that beat, once is never enough, oh
Dig my words, it's a happening scene
Hitch a ride on the party machine
Hey-ey

You know, we're gonna have a real cool time
Your wig will flip so high you'll lose your mind
Let's fly the supersonic to the Sun, hey
There's people swinging on the chandelier (Chandelier)
The pilot's singing to the bombardier (Bombardier)
Saying ooh-wee Capricornia, here we come, here we go
Blow your cool while the night is still young, yeah
Make your move now, you're having some fun, ooh yeah
Catch my wave, won't you tune in on me?
'Cause I want you to raise your antenna now
Hitch a ride on the party machine
The party machine, the party machine, yeah

You know, we're gonna have a real cool time
Your wig will flip so high you'll lose your mind
Let's fly the supersonic to the Sun, hey
There's people swinging on the chandelier
The pilot's singing to the bombardier
Saying ooh-wee Capricornia, here we come, here we go

Move your feet to the rhythm of love
Love, love
Blow your cool while the night is still young
You're wasting your life out there
Catch my wave, won't you tune in on me?
Hitch a ride on the party machine
The party machine, the party machine

I said, where have you been? Said where have you been?
(On the party machine, on the party machine)
Now tell me, what did you see? Now, what did you see?
(Everything) Uh-huh
(Everything) Uh-huh
(Everything) Oh, yeah?
(Everything) Tell me more
(Everything) Now, more
(Everything) And more
(Everything) And more
(Everything) And more
(Everything) Everything and more
(Everything) Everything and more
(Everything)
(Everything) And more
(Everything) And more, and more
(Everything) And more, and more, and more
(Everything) And more, and more
(Everything) And more, and more, and more
(Everything) And more
(Everything) More, more, more, more
(Everything) M-m-m-m-m-m-more
What'd you say?
I wanna go somewhere
But anywhere will do
YeahEmbed
