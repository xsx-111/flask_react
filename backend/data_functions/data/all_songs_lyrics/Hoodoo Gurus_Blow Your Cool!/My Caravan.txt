My Caravan LyricsMy caravan
Is far from home
I seek a path to parts unknown
My caravan
Hides from the Sun
By moonlit night my journey's done
Your smallest wish
Is my command
My caravan
Ships in the night
Ships of the sand
The camel's in my caravan
May Allah smile (Ah)
Upon your land (Ah)
And safely guide my caravan (Ah, ah)
His smallest wish
Is our command
My caravan
I build my dreams
On shifting sand
My caravan
(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah, ah)Embed
