Middle Of The Land Lyrics
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey-hey-hey)

Here I stand in the middle of the land
Take my hand in the middle of the land

You'll see something that's new in the sunshine
You'll be the winter that's turning to springtime

Here I stand in the middle of the land (In the middle of the land)
Take my hand in the middle of the land (In the middle of the land)

Someday someone will try to confuse you
And they'll say what you want to hear and they'll use you
I thought we'd live and learn
But some folks seem to yearn
For values unsophisticated
Those days are dead and gone
I won't wish them back upon
A world that's much more complicated, yeah
Here I stand in the middle of the land (In the middle of the land)
Take my hand in the middle of the land (In the middle of the land)
I said, here I stand in the middle of the land
(In the middle of the land)
You gotta take my hand, I'm always glad to lend a hand
(Always glad to lend a hand)

They'll try to blind you with T.V. religion
Don't buy their hand-me-down second opinions
Sometimes the biggest lies
Are most easily disguised
Dressed up like the Road To Glory
Then somewhere down the line
You'll rub your eyes and find
You're on a path to your own purgatory
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
Yeah

You'll know something as old as the moonlight
You'll throw superstition and fear away tonight
They'll paint us black and white
They'll paint us wrong and right
They'll paint us both into a corner
They'll try to cool us down
But they could never fool us now
We're steamed-up hotter than a Swedish sauna, yeah
Here I stand in the middle of the land
Take my, take my hand, your horizons will expand
Yeah, here I stand in the middle, middle of the land
Land, in the middle, middle of the land

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
The middle of the land
(Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)
In the middle, middle of the land
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Middle of the land
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Land on meEmbed
