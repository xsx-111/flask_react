Out That Door Lyrics
Your kiss can leave me cold
I miss the fire that our hearts used to hold
Oh, oh, there's no danger anymore
Oh, oh, you're not a stranger anymore

And I'm out that door (Out that door)
I'm out that door (If you call)
But I'm not sure
When we decided not to care for each other anymore

By rights we should be friends
My pride was hurt, but is that so hard to mend?
Oh, oh, I've been trying not to phone
Oh, oh, I've gotta know if you're alone

And I'm out that door (Out that door)
If you'll just call (If you call)
And day or night (Night and day)
Anytime at all (If you call)
But should I wait? (Should I wait?)
We're always breakin' up, and makin' up so much better than before

Your touch is my unknown
So much to learn, so little time to know
Oh, oh, we're not strangers anymore

We're out that door (Out that door)
Into the light (Into light)
We'll face the world (Out that door)
Just you and I (You and I)
We'll breathe the air (Out that door)
That freedom brings (Freedom brings)
We'll sing the song (Out that door)
Freedom sings (Freedom sings)

I look in your eyes and it's understood
I look in your eyes and it's understood
I look in your eyes and it's understood
I look in your eyes and it's understoodEmbed
