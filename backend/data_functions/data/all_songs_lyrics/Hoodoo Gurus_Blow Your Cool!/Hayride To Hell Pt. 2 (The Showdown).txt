Hayride To Hell Pt. 2 (The Showdown) LyricsCharlie found Billy
In a far-off town
It had been more than a year since his daughter Marie
Had been put into the ground
Charlie swore when he found him
He would get his revenge
For the loss of a daughter
Billy Jackson's life would come to an end
Ooh, his time would come
Ooh, his time would come
When Billy saw Charlie
It was too late to run
Charlie was standing in the doorway
And in his hand he held a gun
The chase was all over
But Billy felt relieved somehow
For tomorrow he would not have to run
No matter what happened now
Ooh, his time had come
Ooh, his time had come
Billy said, "Charlie, I know you're gonna kill me
But just let me say
It's true, I was the father of Marie's child
And I, I ran away
But we'd planned to get married
But we were both of us just kids
And Marie told me how you got so angry
On the night she tried to tell you what we did
So we decided I should split from town
Until the fuss had all died down
Then I heard how she died
And since that day I've only known misery
Now you've come for my blood
Perhaps I'll get to join my Marie"
Charlie just stood there
And tears filled his eyes
He'd come to kill Billy
But never would, he realised
They both loved his daughter
He knew that at last
And hatred can't build a future
And vengeance can't bring back the past
Ooh, that time has gone
Ooh, that time has goneEmbed
