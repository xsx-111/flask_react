Jungle Bells LyricsHear the jungle bells calling all the pilgrims
Hear the jungle bells scaring all the children
It ain't the voice of God, now darling
Or the work of human hand
But they're reaching out to you from the hinterland
Hear the jungle bells warning all the strangers
Hear the jungle bells ringing in the changes
Once a mission stood there, darling
Choked to death in tangled vines
But when the night is still you can hear their chimes
Hear ghostly chimes
Hear the jungle bells, they start the dogs to howling
Hear the jungle bells, as if the night was growling
We don't care who you are, now darling
But you won't find you're welcome here
And when we call your name you better disappear
DisappearEmbed
