Heart of Darkness LyricsBlood flows just like water
Changing into wine
Everything looks better
In the black sunshine
In the black sunshine
Echoes drag my memories
Back where they began
And I, I just can't be sorry
'Cause those tears turn into sand
All those tears turn into sand
I don't care now
For what might have been
The heart of darkness
Closes in on me
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Hey, yeah
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ahEmbed
