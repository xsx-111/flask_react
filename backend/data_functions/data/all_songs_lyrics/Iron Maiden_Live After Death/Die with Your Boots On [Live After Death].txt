Die with Your Boots On  Lyrics
Yeah, another prophet of disaster
Who says this ship is lost
Another prophet of disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting war for millions
In the hope that one appears

No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame

Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

13, the beast is rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The warlord will arise
Terror, death, destruction
Pour from the eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands

No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

They died, with their boots on
Yes, they died
They died, they died, with their boots on
We died, we died, we died, we died, we died

No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame

Cause if you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die, die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die
(If you're gonna die)
If you're gonna die

If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on
If you're gonna try, well, stick around
Gonna cry, just move along
If you're gonna die, dieEmbed
