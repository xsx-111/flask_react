The Bastards, the Vultures, the Wolves Lyrics
I'm angry like I'm 18 again
And walls are closing in
But the bastards, and the vultures
All want pieces of what's left
We built this out of sweat and spit
With our hearts in place of brick
But I'll burn it to the ground
Before you get your hands on it

So bury me at sea
(Let's pretend it's all a bad dream)
Let me get some sleep
(We'll deal with it in the morning)

I'm waking up to gospel radio
From sleeping with my clothes on
I ended up as food for wolves
For trying to take the world on
I'm wondering where you would be without me
Where you would be without me
Where you would be without me
Where you would be
I know I was an angry kid
But I scraped and scratched for this
Now I'm stuck holding a bomb
With a fuse that's still lit
They'll never let me rest again
And yeah I came out swinging
But I'm still walking out with two black eyes and a split lip

So bury me at sea
(Let's pretend it's all a bad dream)
Let me get some sleep
(We'll deal with it in the morning)

I'm waking up to gospel radio
From sleeping with my clothes on
I ended up as food for wolves
For trying to take the world on
I'm wondering where you would be without me
Where you would be without me
Where you would be without me
Where you would be

Jake says I got good intentions
And I said that I hope he's right
Cause I've been burning every bridge
That I can fucking find tonight
The devil's got a rifle on my front porch
With me in his sights
He knows I came looking for a fight
I came here looking for a fight
I came here looking for a fight
I came here looking for a fight
I came here... (x5)
I came here looking for a fight
I came here looking for a fight
I came here looking for a fight
I came here...
I came here...2Embed
