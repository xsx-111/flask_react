Madelyn LyricsMadelyn, I share your hate for this world we're in
But it makes me a better man
It's an excuse that you make
Madelyn, I know you want to let the bottles in
I know you think that they're all your friends
They're lying straight to your face
I know about the devil in your bloodstream
I know that the ghosts still visit nightly
I know it must get lonely by the Chesapeake
And Madelyn, are you really afraid of death
Or do you just say it if it's the right thing to say?
Madelyn, I know you're safe where you lay your head
But if you wanted to come back, I've got a place you could stay
If I'm not doing right by my family
Then what's the point of it anyway?
I don't think there's a god
I don't think that there's someone coming to save us
And I don't think that's the worst news of the day
I don't think there's a god
I don't think that there's someone coming to save me
And I don't think that's the worst news of the day
So Madelyn, I know how your cold scars turn purple
I know how the Irish goodbyes feel, I know where you've been
And Madelyn, you and I got this East Coast blood between us
It's bitter and vitriolic, I know how it ends
If I'm not doing right by my family...
Oh, I'm not doing right by familyEmbed
