Cul-de-sac Lyrics
I've been leaving messages
On an answering machine
In a house that's always empty, so I know nobody's listening
I've been confessing my transgressions over tape hiss
The silence makes me sick
No good can come from this

I'm letting go
I've been hanging on like poison ivy
Out of cold suburban concrete
From this careless urban sprawl
I'm letting go
You know we can't keep out of trouble
I thought my kids would call you uncle
I thought we'd never be alone

Well I got images
Of you inside my head
Outside of the gas station where we always used to shoplift
It's car-crash rhetoric
We fucked up everything we came in contact with
Just boyhood recklessness
I'm letting go
I've been hanging on like poison ivy
Out of cold suburban concrete
From this careless urban sprawl
I'm letting go
You know we can't keep out of trouble
I thought my kids would call you uncle
I thought we'd never be alone

If you walked me home
Then you'd know how weak my arms got
I just can't carry you
If you walked me home
Well, I know that I'd have flashbacks
Of snow angels and gut laughs
If you walked me home
But you won't, you're all alone
On some bullshit, pill-bottle vision quest
If you walked me home
Well, I don't know when I would finally
Work up the backbone
To walk alone

I’m letting go
'Cause I loved you
But I have to
I'm letting go
You know we can't keep out of trouble
I thought my kids would call you uncle
I thought we'd never be alone
I’m letting go
(If you walked me home...)1Embed
