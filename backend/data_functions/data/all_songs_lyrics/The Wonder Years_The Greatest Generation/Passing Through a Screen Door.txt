Passing Through a Screen Door Lyrics
Cigarette smoke dances back in the window
And I can see the haze on the dome light
I’m conjuring ghosts on a forty-hour ride home
And they keep asking me what I’m doing with my life
While my cousins go to bed with their wives
I’m feeling like I've fallen behind

Well, the highway won
I’m listening to traffic reports one on one
Coming quietly undone
I was born to run
Away from anything good
An escape artist's son
Sun-drenched pavement in my blood
The first thing that I do when I walk in
Is find a way out for when shit gets bad, and

I’ve been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I’ve been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)
Well I’m terrified
Like a kid in the sixties
Staring at the sky
Waiting for the bomb to fall
And it’s all a lie
What they say about stability
It scares me sometimes
The emptiness I see in my eyes
And all the kids' names I’ve ever liked
Are tied to tragedy
And I don’t want my children growing up to be
Anything like me
I’ve been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I’ve been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)
And I was kinda hoping you'd stay
I was kinda hoping you'd stay

I keep a flashlight
And a small knife
In the corner of my bed stand
I keep a flashlight
And the train times
But you wouldn't understand
How could you understand?
Jesus Christ, I’m twenty-six
All the people I graduated with
All have kids
All have wives
All have people who care if they come home at night
Well, Jesus Christ, did I fuck up?

I’ve been looking for
Tears in the screen door (Tears in the screen door)
I’ve been waiting for
Another disaster (Another disaster)
And I was kinda hoping you'd stay
I was kinda hoping you'd stay
I was kinda hoping you'd stay4Embed
