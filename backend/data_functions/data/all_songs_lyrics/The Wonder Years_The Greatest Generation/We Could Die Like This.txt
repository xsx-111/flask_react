We Could Die Like This Lyrics
Memories flood back like photographs
All bright and out of focus, all drab with muted colors
The whole world smells like True Blue
The only brand my grandma smokes
And the faintest hint of Coppertone
I'm watching shorebirds circle in real close
(I know you're gonna go, just please leave me a note)
(I left because you asked me to)

Operator, take me home, I don't know where else to go
I wanna die in the suburbs
A heart attack, shovelling snow, all alone
If I die, I wanna die in the suburbs

These northeast winters make boys into men
Staring out at snow-ploughed mountains
In the parking lots of churches
The city just felt worn out
No strength to pick our hearts off the ground
We watched the '92 Birds
Take the field without Jerome Brown
(We keep quiet when it gets bad)
(We don't talk about the setbacks)
(They only hear it when your voice cracks)

Operator, take me home, I don't know where else to go
I wanna die in the suburbs
A heart attack, shovelling snow, all alone
If I die, I wanna die in the suburbs

I wanna die in the suburbs, I wanna die in the suburbs
I wanna die in the suburbs, I wanna die in the suburbs
I wanna die in the suburbs
(You start remembering...)
I wanna die in the suburbs
(...the anniversaries of the bad things)
I wanna die in the suburbs
(You start remembering...)
I wanna die in the suburbs
(...the anniversaries of the bad things)

Operator, take me home, I don't know where else to go
I wanna die in the suburbs
A heart attack, shovelling snow, all alone
If I die, I wanna die in the suburbs
Operator, take me home, I don't know where else to go
I wanna die in the suburbs
A heart attack, shovelling snow, all alone
If I die, I wanna die in the suburbs
I wanna die in the suburbs1Embed
