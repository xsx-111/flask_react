Dismantling Summer Lyrics
I'm pulling wings off insects
I'm peeling back my sunburnt skin
I'll wait outside your bedroom
I hope they let me in
I'm filling your prescriptions
The orange bottles stare me down
They're standing at attention
An army on your windowsill
We're all waiting for good news
Hoping you can come home soon
We're all waiting for good news

I've been acting like I'm strong
But the truth is, I've been losing ground
To a hospital too crowded
A summer winding down
I hadn't seen a heart break until now
I hadn't felt a heartbreak until now

I grew up on your back porch
And I watched the storms light up the clouds
They hung like paper lanterns
To guide the way back toward your house
I've been putting off long flights
Hoping that you'll be all right
And I'll be there in the meantime

I've been acting like I'm strong
But the truth is, I've been losing ground
To a hospital too crowded
A summer winding down
I hadn't seen a heart break until now
I hadn't felt a heartbreak until now

If I'm in an airport
And you're in a hospital bed
Well, then, what kind of man does that make me?
If I'm in an airport
And you're in a hospital bed
Well, then, what kind of man does that make me?
If I'm in an airport
If I'm in an airport
What kind of man does that make me?
What kind of man does that make me?

I've been acting like I'm strong
But the truth is, I've been losing ground
To a hospital too crowded
A summer winding down
I hadn't seen a heart break until now
I hadn't felt a heartbreak until now
I hadn't felt a heartbreak until now
I hadn't felt a heartbreak until now
I've been losing ground
A summer winding down
I hadn't seen a heart break until now
I hadn't felt a heartbreak until now4Embed
