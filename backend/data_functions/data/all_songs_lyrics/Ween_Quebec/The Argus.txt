The Argus Lyrics
Yesterday we lost our lives, tomorrow we were born
Fortunes smiled upon us
Sacrifice the Argus
All that he might help us see
Magna eyes the track for miles
Looking for disease
Puzzled by the mountain
Tricked by the sea

And the Argus is practiced compassion
With an eye on you, as one is on me
Will the god eye grant his forgiveness
And allow he that's lived, a reason to see?

Counting days and building walls, bells ring so's to warn
All the signs that guide us
Chosen by the Argus
Tell me he has chosen you
Led by form we'll shed our souls
Trusting like a child
See the dark face that saved us
Drink from his empty eyes
And the Argus is practiced compassion
With an eye on you, as one is on me
Will the god eye grant his forgiveness
Letting droplets of light erupt from the sea...?


Lying in beds of garlic and orchids
He closes an eye, which closes another
And in sleep he dreams, of watching and looking
And feather clouds dancing, he curls up his lid and sleeps...
Swirling with visions on man's confusion
All of the work, done just to appease him
The Argus he cries, though love has its place in the sun
It's only man's fear that carries him on...
