Chocolate Town Lyrics
I couldn't taste the taste that I was tasting
I couldn't hear the waste that I was making
Tired of the life I was facing

I couldn't tell one from another
I couldn't hide a secret from my mother
Any other mother wouldn't bother

Making time breaking ground
Sail brown bay to Chocolate Town

Got me on the porch, I'm in the front row
Said "Shit's for real, man" like I don't know
Well, get your punk ass back to the dog show

Making time breaking ground
Sail brown bay to Chocolate Town

A new breath, I feel the grip releasing
Scraping my guts off of the ceiling
I've got that sunny bunny feeling
Making time breaking ground
Sail brown bay to chocolate town
Making time breaking ground
Sail brown bay to chocolate town
Making time breaking ground
Greyhound bus to chocolate town...3Embed
