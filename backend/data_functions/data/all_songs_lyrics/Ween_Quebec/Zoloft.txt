Zoloft Lyrics
Gimme that Z-O-L-O-F-T
Gimme a grip, make me love me
Suckin' 'em down, I'm happy, man
Can feel it inside, makin' me smile
(Realize that the sky's not made of gold)
(Don't disguise the nature of your soul)

Gimme that Z-O-L-O-F-T
No longer pissed, you don't bother me
I'm makin' it through, I'm givin' my all
When base are loaded, I'm whacking the ball
(Don't suck the mind, don't drain the source)
(The path of life's not so easy to course, buddy)


Gimme that Z-O-L-O-F-T
(I can't explain why I'm feeling this way)
Gimme a grip (Grip), make me love me
(Trips in the barren for the month)
Suckin' 'em down (I'm suckin' 'em down), I'm happy, man
(Are you a monkey or a man-child?)
Can feel it inside, makin' me smile
