Captain Lyrics
Captain, turn around and take me home
Captain, turn around and take me home
Captain, turn around and take me home
Captain, turn around and take me home
Captain, turn around and take me home
Captain, turn around and take me home
Captain, turn around and take me home
(Blink at the knifelight swathe me in mesh
The water, it’s cold like when I kneel at Death’s Gate
I’m a bringer of siege)
Captain, turn around and take me home
(A ground pig who awaits it’s master
A living monument to a fallen soldier
Let me lie awake now
And condense this fog into nada)
Captain, turn around and take me home
(Bring me to harbor
Bring me to harbor)1Embed
