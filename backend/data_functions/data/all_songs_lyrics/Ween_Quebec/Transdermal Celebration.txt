Transdermal Celebration Lyrics
Transdermal celebration
Caused a slight mutation in the rift
It toppled down a nation
And left the people running for the hills
But the mutants that I see
Shine their beauty unto me
I wish you could see them

Tectonic tribulation
Formed a crust of green beyond the reef
Waves fell in formation
Cause the plants to bend with spiked leaves
I'm growing with the land
Time has taken my hands
And let me touch them

Hey, hey
A billion miles to Mark A
Lay on the lawn, he's already home
When the morning ray hits his face

Transdermal celebration
Jets flew in formation, I could see them
Dropping their crustaceans
Leaving trails of flames in their wake
But where is the mutation
That once told me it was safe
I can't find him
Hey, hey
A billion miles to Mark A
Lay on the lawn, he's already home
When the morning ray hits his face4Embed
