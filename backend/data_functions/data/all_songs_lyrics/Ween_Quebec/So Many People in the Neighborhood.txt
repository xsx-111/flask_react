So Many People in the Neighborhood Lyrics
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
I don't know if they're very good people


So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
I don't know if they're very good people
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood

So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood (in the neighborhood)
In the neighborhood, in the neighborhood
In the neighborhood

How's about a piece of pie? Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Fancy locks and cocks and rocks, stay inside, stay inside
How's about a piece of pie? Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Fancy locks and cocks and rocks, stay inside, stay inside
How's about a piece of pie? Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
How's about a piece of pie? Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Fancy locks and cocks and rocks, stay inside, stay inside
How's about a piece of pie? Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Fancy locks and cocks and rocks, stay inside, stay inside
How's about a piece of pie? Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Fancy locks and cocks and rocks, stay inside, stay inside
How's about a piece of pie? Ding, dong! Ding, dong!
Fancy locks and cocks and rocks, stay inside, stay inside
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
I don't know if they're very good people
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
So many people in the neighborhood
I don't know if they're very good people (In the neighborhood)
I don't know if they're very good people (In the neighborhood)
I don't know if they're very good people (In the neighborhood)Embed
