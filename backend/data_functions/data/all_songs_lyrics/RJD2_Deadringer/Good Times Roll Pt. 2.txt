Good Times Roll Pt. 2 Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard the Soul for Sound, part one, now

Part two, are you ready? (Yeah)
Do you wanna hear it? (Yeah)
Part two, are you ready? (Yeah)
Do you wanna hear it? (Yeah)
Part two, are you ready? (Yeah)
Do you wanna hear it? (Yeah)
Part two, are you ready? (Yeah)
Do you wanna hear it? (Yeah)

Gypsy woman told my mother before I was born
You got a boy child coming and the world's gonna know
Got my black cat bone, got my mojo too
And all you can run, I'm gon' mess with you

Gypsy woman told my mother before I was born
You got a boy child coming and the world's gonna know
Got my black cat bone, got my mojo too
And all you can run, I'm gon' mess with you

Part two, are you ready? (Yeah)
Do you wanna hear it? (Yeah)
Part two, are you ready? (Yeah)
Do you wanna hear it? (Yeah)
Part two, are you ready? (Yeah)
Do you wanna hear it? (Yeah)
Part two, are you ready? (Yeah)
Do you wanna hear it? (Yeah)

Don't wait, work now
Don't wait, work now
Don't wait, work nowEmbed
