Smoke & Mirrors Lyrics
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?
Maybe sunshine and maybe rain
But as for me, I'll wait and see
Maybe it'll bring my love to me, who knows

Who knows what tomorrow will bring?
Maybe sunshine and maybe rain
But as for me, I'll wait and see
Maybe it'll bring my love to me, who knows

Sometimes I feel rainy days
Just to let you know everything's gonna be
Alright, alrightEmbed
