I Float Alone Lyrics
Floating through this darkness
All alone
Love is gone in darkness
Cold as a stone
Searching through the shadows you have known
Love's gone
Bare as a bone

Trying to hold the memory face
You seem to have vanished without a trace
And in this darkness
This empty space
I float alone

Now the night is falling
You have gone
Sad dreams blow through dark trees
Love's gone wrong
Clouds of sadness raining all night long
Love's gone
The end of our song

I float alone
I float alone1Embed
