The World Spins Lyrics
Moving near the edge at night
Dust is dancing in the space
A dog and bird are far away
The sun comes up and down each day
Light and shadow change the walls
Halley's Comet's come and gone
The things I touch are made of stone
Falling through this night alone

Love
Don't go away
Come back this way
Come back and stay
Forever and ever
Please stay

Dust is dancing in the space
A dog and bird are far away
The sun comes up and down each day
The river flows out to the sea

Love
Don't go away
Come back this way
Come back and stay
Forever and ever
