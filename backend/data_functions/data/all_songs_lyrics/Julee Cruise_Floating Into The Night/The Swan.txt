The Swan Lyrics
You made the tears of love
Flow like they did when I saw
The dying swan
The swan that died in darkness
I want your smile
I dreamt of your swan smile
And then wings moved the air
Water rings widened
As bells sounded
In the night

Then your smile died
On the water
It was only a reflection
Dying with the swan1Embed
