I Remember Lyrics
I remember your song
And the way you sang it to me
So many times in other forms
On distant lands

I remember your smile
And the way you sent it to me
So many times through different air
It lives inside my heart

It is a dream
You and me
Is it a dream
You and me (It can't be real)
I never felt a wind
So happy, so warm (It can't be real)
That sent seven little red birds up my spine
I never felt a wind
So happy, so warm (It can't be real)
That sent seven little red birds up my spine
Singing

Shoowap, Shoowap, Shoowap, Shoowap...1Embed
