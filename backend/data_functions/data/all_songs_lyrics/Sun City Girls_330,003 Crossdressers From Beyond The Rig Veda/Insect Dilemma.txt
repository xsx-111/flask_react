Insect Dilemma LyricsIn some Damn Good Daylight I had an insect Dilemma
I was buzzin' the Horizon stung the scarlet Panorama
And the guards took my Camera
But my skull Doctor's Photos showed no infectious diseases
Only 37 pretty pleases -- And a queen Bee She Rises
She stole my History kept me a mystery
And a queen Bee She Rises -- And a queen Bee She Rises
She stole my History and kept me a mystery
And a queen Bee She RisesEmbed
