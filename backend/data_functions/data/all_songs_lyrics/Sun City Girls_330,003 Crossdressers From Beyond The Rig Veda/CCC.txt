CCC LyricsI was layin' around in a sweaty chlorine aroma
Drifting late nite in a Calcutta codeine coma
With a Drake R8 Implant Eardrum Stereo
Sleepwalkin' six feet deep Sudder Street nowhere to go
Goodnite elixir Bengali sippin' his soma
Floatin' late night in a Calcutta codeine coma
With a flashlite in one hand bottle of cough syrup in the other
Stumblin' thru the Kali temple lookin' for his mother
When a stink comes from the sewars
Sweet Agarbathi from the roof
I forgot where I was buried
Because I don't need to show the proof
I was layin' down low in a sweaty chlorine aroma
Driftin' late nite in a Calcutta codeine coma
Swimmin' up the crooked Hoogley like a fish no one could catch
Washed-up ugly in the marshes half the way to BangladeshEmbed
