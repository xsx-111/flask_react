Rookoobay LyricsI had to take a chance
And go to the Shango dance
I wanted a new romance
That's why I went to the Shango dance
The high priest looked very mean
When he appeared up on the scene
He make a seemy seemy
So they began the ceremony
Oh what they sang now...
Rookoobay, Rookoobayella (rookoo, rookoobay)
Rookoobay, Rookoobayella (a comparti aroma y velma)
Rookoobay, Rookoobayella (bing bop, bing bope y velma)
Rookoobay, Rookoobayella (rookoo, rookoobay)
I don't know how it happen
But I was so very frightened
The high priest had me in dread
The man made a goat walk without a head
Then there was an old lady
With a snake tied round sheepily
With an old pan in she left hand
Throwing sweet oil on the opium man
What they sang now...
Rookoobay, Rookoobayella (rookoo, rookoobay)
Rookoobay, Rookoobayella (bing bop, bing bope y velma)Embed
