Go Easy LyricsLooking at me you never find out what a working man's about:
Raving all night, sleeping away the day
Something to ask
Something to say
Something to keep the pain away;
Something I'd like to see if it's alright
Life, go easy on me;
Love, don't pass me by
Spending my time, making it shine, gotta throw away the rest
Look at the ways to vent and amaze my mind
Something I need
Something I plea for
Something I have to say;
Something to keep me safe while I'm away
Life, go easy on me;
Love, don't pass me by
Life, go easy on me;
Love, don't pass me by
One way for me, one way for you, one way for all of us
To get back home, do whatever we want to do
Nothing to tell you
Nothing to show
Nothing that you don't know
Something to play
Something to say for now
Life, go easy on me;
Love, don't pass me by
Life, go easy on me;
Love, don't pass me by
Love, don't pass me by...2Embed
