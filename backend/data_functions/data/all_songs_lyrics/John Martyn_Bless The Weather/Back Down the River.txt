Back Down the River LyricsI know that we're going to be together, you and me
For more than a rhyme or two, your time belongs to me
Rowing back down my river
Chasing my tail to the sea;
Rowing back down my river
Trying my best to be me
Watching your crazy ways and all the lazy days
Digging you more and more, the more I see your face
Rowing back down my river
Trying my best to be free;
Rowing back down my river
Chasing my tail to the sea
Watching the simple things to help me grow along
Loving the notes you bring to help me sing my song
Rowing back down my river
Trying my best to be me;
Rowing back down my river
Singing my songs to the sea
I know that we're going to be together, you and me
For more than a time or two, your rhymes belong to me
Rowing back down my river
Chasing my tail to the sea;
Rowing back down my river
Trying my best to be meEmbed
