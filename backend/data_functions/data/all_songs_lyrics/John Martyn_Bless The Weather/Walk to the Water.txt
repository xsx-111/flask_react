Walk to the Water LyricsShe walked to the water
And came back looking good and feeling fine
And you could tell by her eyes, she was not wasting time
She walked to the water
And every light went on inside the town
You know the love in her eyes, was flashing on the rocks all around
Down to the water
She walked and all the people moved aside
You know the light in her hair so bright, they almost cried
Saved by the water
She said and she was right, I know she was
You know she told me true about all the things I got
Going down to see her
Bring yourself and all that you might own
She can give you the clues to all the seeds you've sown
Down to the water
She came back feeling fine and looking good
And you could tell by her eyes that she always knew she wouldEmbed
