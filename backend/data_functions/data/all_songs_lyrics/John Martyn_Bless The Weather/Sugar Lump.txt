Sugar Lump LyricsGet down, mama, to my sugar cube
Get down mama, won't you try to make it move
My sugar cube, my sugar cube
Come on, mama, try to lose your mind
Get down, spent some time on my sugar cube
Gonna sweeten your night
Gonna sweeten your day
So much sweeter, you're just going to be amazed
At my sugar cube, my sugar cube
Get down, mama, won't you lose your mind
Won't you please get down
And try to lose your mind, on my sugar cube
I don't wish civil shit
And I don't care to boast
You know that love is from coast to coast
My sugar cube, my little sugar cube
Come on, mama, won't you lose your mind;
Get down and waste some time on my sugar cube
Get down, mama, on my sugar cube
Please get down, won't you try to make it move
My sugar cube, my sugar cube
Come on, mama, won't you lose your mind
Won't you please get down and try to spend some time
On my sugar cubeEmbed
