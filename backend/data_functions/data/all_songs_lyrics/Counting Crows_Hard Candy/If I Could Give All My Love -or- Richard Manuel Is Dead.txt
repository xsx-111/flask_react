If I Could Give All My Love -or- Richard Manuel Is Dead LyricsGot a message in my head that the papers had all come
Richard Manuel is dead and the daylight's coming on
I've been wandering through the dark
And now I'm standing on the lawn
If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You’re a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of the clock that tells the time
That is running out on you
It was cold when I awoke
And the day was halfway done
Nearly spring in San Francisco
And I cannot feel the sun
You were sleeping next to me
But I knew you'd be gone
If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You’re a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of the clock that tells the time
That is running out on you
Take some time before you go
To think of Mondays coming down
And the people that you knew
And the ones that aren't around
You've been fading day to day
I've been moving town to town
If I could give all my love to you
I could justify myself
But I'm just not coming through
You’re a pill to ease the pain
Of all the stupid things I do
I'm an anchor on the line
Of the clock that tells the time
That is running out on youEmbed
