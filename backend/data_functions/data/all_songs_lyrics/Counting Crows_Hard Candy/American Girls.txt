American Girls LyricsShe comes out on Fridays every time
Stands out in a line
I could have been anyone she'd seen
She waits another week to fall apart
She couldn't make another day
I wish it was anyone but me
I could have been anyone you see
She had something breakable just under her skin
American girls
All weather and noise
Playing the changes for all of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
She comes out of closets every night
And then she locks herself away
Where she could keep everything from me
I could have been anyone you see
She's nothing but porcelain underneath her skin
American girls
All weather & noise
Playing the changes for all the of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
Little shivers shaking me every day
But I could get this same thing anywhere
So if she goes away
Well, it's alright and I'm ok
“Hey” she said, “Come back again tonight.”
I said, “I might. I might. I might.”
She said, “Well that's alright
If it's alright with you
Then it's alright with me.”
I waited for an hour last Friday night
She never came around
She took almost everything from me
I'm going through my closets
Trying on her clothes almost every day
I could have been anyone you see
I wish it was anyone but me
There's nothing but pills and ashes under my skin
American girls
All weather & noise
Playing the changes for all the of the boys
Holding a candle up to my hand
Making me feel so incredible
If I made you cry
Please tell me why
'Cause I'll try again if you let me try
American girls
All feathers & cream
Come into bed so edibleEmbed
