Butterfly In Reverse LyricsMary Anne, you're better than the world
They took a lot of time getting it right on this girl
I said Mary Anne, you're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girl
Had a lot of girlfriends
I should have known them
Click your heels and count back from three
Do you wanna go back?
You should have known that
The butterfly in reverse here is me
Mary Anne, you're better than the world
They took a lot of time getting it right on this girl
I said Mary Anne, you're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girl
Where'd you wanna go to
With nothing beside you
But webbing and curfews and rain?
And everything that hurts you
Is locked up inside you
Like butterflies with wings
And other perfect things
We go swimming in the sunshine
Dangling from clotheslines
Separate and fall into me
And did you ever seen me?
Me absolutely?
Me, but all you, but still me?
Mary Anne, you're better than the world
They took a lot of time getting it right on this girl
I said Mary Anne, you're better than the world
They did a lot of things right on this girlEmbed
