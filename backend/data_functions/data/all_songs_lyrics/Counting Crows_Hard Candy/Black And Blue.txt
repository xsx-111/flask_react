Black And Blue LyricsFading everything to black and blue
You look a lot like you'd shatter in the blink of an eye
But you keep sailing right on through
Every time you say you're learning
You just look a lot like me
Pale under the blistering sky
White and red
Black and blue
You've been waiting a long time
You've been waiting a long time
To fall down on your knees
Cut your hands
Cut yourself until you bleed
Just fall asleep next to me
Wait for everyone to go away
And in a dimly lit room where you've got nothing to hide
Say your goodbyes
Tell yourself we'll read a note that says
"I'm sorry everyone
I'm tired of feeling nothing
Goodbye"
Wash your face
Dry your eyes
You've been waiting a long time
You've been waiting a long time
To fall down on your knees
Cut your hands
Cut yourself until you bleed
But fall asleep next to me
Have a dream I'm falling down on my face
I scrape my knees
I scrape my hands until they bleed
'Cause you're fast asleep next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me1Embed
