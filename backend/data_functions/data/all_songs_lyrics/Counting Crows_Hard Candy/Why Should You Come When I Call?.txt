Why Should You Come When I Call? LyricsIt's one thirty in the morning
But that's all right by me
Weren't you just waiting by the phone
Well, I should give a little warning
But I need the things I need
I'm not proud to need a hand
But I just don't understand
So why should you come when I call?
I never say nothing at all
Why do I go when I go?
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own
Ain't necessarily a bad thing
To believe the things I say
'Cause you can make yourself feel good
You know, it's really not a good thing
To give everything to me
I'm just waiting for the show
'Cause I got nowhere to go
So why should you come when I call?
I never say nothing at all
Why do I go when I go?
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own
Cause nothing makes me feel so good (makes me feel so good)
And gets me high (gets me high)
So I sleep at night
And let's me know that everything's all right
I feel nice
I'm so sorry in the morning
You can believe what you believe
But I'm used to waking up alone
But if you think about it
Anyone you think about is better love than me
But if you've not fallen quite asleep
I might call tonight
If that's alright
Why should you come when I call?
I never say nothing at all
Why do I go when I go?
It's leaving me here all alone
You ought to get out on your own
Oh, why should you come when I call?
Oh, why do I go when I go?
Why should you
Why should you come when I call?
Why should you come
Why should you come when I call?Embed
