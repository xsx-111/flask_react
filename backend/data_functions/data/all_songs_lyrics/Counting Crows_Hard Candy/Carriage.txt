Carriage LyricsIf anything, it should have been a better thing
From underneath you staring at the ceiling
There's another world of chocolate bars and baseball cards
That hides inside of all this tension that I'm feeling
But it's all inside of you
Yeah, it's all inside of you
Surprise, surprise
I miss your hair
You miss my eyes
And all this solitude is my confidence eroding
So we slide inside of someone's mouth and someone's eyes
Until there's the sound of something intimate exploding
But it's all inside of you
Yeah, it's all inside of you
Oh, it's all inside of you
Yeah, it's all inside of you
I wish that I was anesthetized and sterilized
And then we wouldn't have this evidence congealing
Surprise, surprise
Another pair of lips and eyes
And that is the consequence of actually feeling
It was all inside of you
It was all inside of you
It was all inside of you
It was all inside of youEmbed
