Up All Night (Frankie Miller Goes To Hollywood) LyricsIs everybody happy now?
Is everybody clear?
We could drive out to the dunes tonight
'Cause summer's almost here
I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
And let 'em slip away
I might sleep all day
And when the roads are clear
You head on out of here
And if you're coming back
I'll see you in the morning
I'm just staring at the ceiling staring back at me
Just waiting for the daylight to come crawling in on me
But I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
And let 'em slip away
I might sleep all day
Ohh, it's too late to get high now
Ohh, it's too late to get high now
Fix your hair just right
Put your jeans on tight
Or wear a dress so I can get it off real easy
'Cause I've been thinking
I'd like to see your eyes open up real wide
The minute that you see me
If you don't come through
I wouldn't wait for you
I understand that everyone goes disappearing
Into the greater gray that covers over everyday
And hovers in the distance
In the distance
In the distance
And I've been up all night
I might sleep all day
Get your dreams just right
Then let 'em slip away
I might sleep all day
Ohh, it's too late to get high now
Ohh, it's too late to get high now
I said baby now now now
I said baby now now now
It's too late (well, it's too late)
Ohhhhhh
Baby now now now
I said baby now now now
Said it's too late (well, it's too late)
Oh, I only wanna get high
Na na na nanan
I said na na na nanana
It's too late (well, it's too late)
Oh, I only wanna get high
Na na na nanana, I said na na na nanana
I said it's too late (well, it's too late)
Oh, I only only only only
Na na na nanana, awwww na na na nanana
It's too late, ohhEmbed
