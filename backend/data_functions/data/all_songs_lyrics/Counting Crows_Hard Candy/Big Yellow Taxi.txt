Big Yellow Taxi Lyrics
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot

Ooooh, bop bop bop
Ooooh, bop bop bop

They took all the trees, and put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them
No, no, no

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'till it's gone
They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot

Ooooh, bop bop bop
Ooooh, bop bop bop

Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT
I don't care about spots on my apples
Leave me the birds and the bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'till it's gone
They paved paradise, and put up a parking lot
Hey now!
They paved paradise, to put up a parking lot

Ooooh, bop bop bop
Ooooh, bop bop bop


Listen, late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took my girl away

Now, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Hey na na, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Why not?
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Hey, hey, hey
Paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Ooooh, bop bop bop
Ooooh, bop bop bop

I don't wanna give it
Why you wanna give it
Why you wanna giving it all away
Hey, hey, hey
Now you wanna give it
I should wanna give it
Now you wanna giving it all away
I don't wanna give it
Why you wanna give it
Why you wanna give it all away
Hey, hey, hey
Now you wanna give it
I should wanna give it
Now you wanna giving it all away

Why do you want me?
Why do you want to?
Cos' you're givin it all away
Hey, paved paradise to put up a parking lot5Embed
