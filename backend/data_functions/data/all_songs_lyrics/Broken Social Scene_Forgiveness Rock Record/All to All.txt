All to All Lyrics
Call of forgiveness
I'm like the beat of the hurt
I'm not the only one you tried to save when you fell out
Call of forgiveness
I'm like the clean in the dirt
I'm not the only one you tried to crave when you fell out

(Try, wait) You made your life on everything
(Hard, made) You made your life on everything
(Try, wait) You made your life on everything
(Long, fade) You made your life on everything

Call of forgiveness
I'm like the heal of the hurt
I'm like the only one you tried to save when you fell out
Call of forgiveness
I'm like the queen of the dirt
I'm like the only one who tried to stay when you fell out

It's like the common law was wall to wall and almost faded
I've seen the gone to small, the lost of law, the almost made it
It seems like mine to shine, you'll always find the lonely ray
It's like the wall to fall, the fall of all, the laws are graded
I've seen the lies that call, the pictures tall, the lines are made in
It's like the fight to crawl, my darling, all you've lived your age
I know it's all to all, all to all ultimatum
It's like the all to all, all to all ultimatum
It's like the all to all, the all to all, the ultimatum
I know it's all to all, all to all ultimatum
Just like the all to all, all to all ultimatum
It's like the all to all, the all to all, the ultimatum
You made your life on everything
You made your life on everythingEmbed
