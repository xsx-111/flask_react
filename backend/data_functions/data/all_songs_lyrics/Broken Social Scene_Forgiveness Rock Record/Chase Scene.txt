Chase Scene LyricsAll the dirty fingers picking up finds
Bruised with a motherless childish mind
To be kind in the line of design
Without a proper subject
Got all apologies, signed up to steal
Prednisone body, topic of ill
For the chill and the thrill of the kill
I see my woman calling
Because I licked a little skin like a fear in my bed
Spilt all the toxic cream of my dead
To be bled or fed in the spread
Of equal wrong talking
Spoon me like a stereotype, rigging the race
Believing in a feather, particular face
With the grace for the trace to embrace
The frontal feel falling
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight
If the caterpillar cat turns free to a whore
The idea that there's a seventeenth floor
To explore like hardcore for the more
And never seem to free it
Because I gave a little long, yeah, I gave it a shot
Bought me some land and a beautiful plot
With a hot who was not to be got
By easy thinking thumbing
Bottled up can will eat through your life
Down with the deed of killing a wife
With a knife who thinks twice to the wise
I think my woman's calling
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
I think I'm ready to go
I think I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my life
Yeah, I'm ready to go
Yeah, I'm ready to fight for the scene of my lifeEmbed
