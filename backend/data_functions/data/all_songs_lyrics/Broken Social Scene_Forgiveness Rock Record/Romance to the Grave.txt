Romance to the Grave Lyrics

When I'm right, I'm always wrong beneath the wise, rolling through the way
(Further my luck tries to be the same)
When I'm wrong, I'm almost right to breathe the miles coming through the haze
(Still like I thought)
I don't speak the tongues of finds within a life, dying for a save
(Stomp on guitar line)
I got buried with my tribe from the start, romance to the grave
(Star)
And in your house you built to fail through all the eyes, wondering what to say
(Followed by, "Keep on")
This might be the last of light inside your lock only you can break
(For all these times, never mind)
Because when you're right, you're never wrong to reach the high, low for you to wait
(Fall on days)

I don't lived for all that died
I just want to feel it againEmbed
