Water in Hell Lyrics
The newspaper ride is hanging like a thread
You're looking for your sailor boy
The music uncertainly, disconcertingly
You're looking for your sailor boy

From what I can tell
There's water in hell

The shuck and jive, the shuck and jive is over
The shuck and jive, the shuck and jive is over
The second time, the second time is over
It's too bad the monkey's on your shoulder

Well the truth be a lying stone cold messiah
It's time to let the cash roll in
This ain't the kind of man I want to defend
It's the year 2010

From what I can tell
There's water in hell
The shuck and jive, the shuck and jive is over
The shuck and jive, the shuck and jive is over
The second time, the second time got older
It's too bad the monkey's not

No one likes to lose (No one likes to lose)
No one likes to lose

There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hell
There's water in hellEmbed
