Art House Director Lyrics
Art house director, art house director
We lost magic light until tomorrow night
Art house director, art house director
Make the waters part into an empty heart

It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?

Defeat deflector, defeat deflector
The rushes will not lie, I swear this is your guy
And the starlet is a harlot, she does not leave the trailer
She thinks that you're a jailer or someone that delayed her

It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?
It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?
I never meant for it to be that way
But since I have your attention
I'll just give you what you want
And maybe I'll be in your trailer

Canyon connector, purist protector
All the fun fell through, we can't escape the gloom
And the starlet is a harlot, she will not leave the trailer
She says that you betrayed her with a surfer from Australia

It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?
It's been like a joke
Every step of the way
Is there something to coax
The truth of the day?Embed
