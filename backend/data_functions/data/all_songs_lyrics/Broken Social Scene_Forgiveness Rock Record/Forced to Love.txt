Forced to Love Lyrics
Well, if you think about it then you're a fool, yeah
It's just a size and the mind that won't give you up
And if I think about it, well, am I cool yet?
Because it's the word of the mouth that won't cut you up
And if we think about it, well, is it true yet?
Because there's no line that reminds whether we are enough
So let's think about it, oh, are we through yet?
It's just the crime at the time of a masculine hug

Because we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love

When we speak about it (Made the right always open)
And if I speak about it (Erase the lies, love is frozen)
So if you think about it, what would you do?
You're just the man with the plan saying we are not lost
So let's think about it, oh, are we through yet?
It's just the time to decide if we can move up, up, up, up

Because we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love

Because we're forced to love
Yeah, we're forced to love
All the time
Forced to love

Well, if you think about it then you're a fool, yeah
Because you decide to believe in what we made up
And if I think about it, am I cool yet?
Because there's no lie like that lie that made us give upEmbed
