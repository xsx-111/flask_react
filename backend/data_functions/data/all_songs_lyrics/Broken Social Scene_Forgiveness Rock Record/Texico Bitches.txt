Texico Bitches Lyrics
Texico bitches, have you begun again?
Texico bitches, I think you found a friend
Texico bitches, the air you breathe is real
Texico bitches, why do you like to steal?

I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe fag

Texico bitches, this town is going down (Sparkle like an old drone)
Texico bitches, I hope you stick around (Melt like a snowcone)
Texico bitches, the guns beneath the youth (Talking on the phone-phone)
Texico bitches, this story needs some truth (Every time I'm going, I'm only gonna miss you)

I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe fag
I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe fag


Texico bitches, the light is coming in
Texico bitches, I think we're bound to win
Texico bitches, my weapon is my truce (Tire of a hobo)
Texico bitches, I do not like to lose (Talking on the phone-phone)
I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe flag
I wanna be fair
Like a wannabe fagEmbed
