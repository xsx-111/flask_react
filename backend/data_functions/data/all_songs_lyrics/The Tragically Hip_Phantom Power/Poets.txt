Poets Lyrics
Spring starts when a heartbeat's poundin'
When the birds can be heard above the reckonin' carts doin' some final accountin'
Lava flowin' in Superfarmer's direction
He's been gettin' reprieve from the heat in the frozen food section, yeah

Don't tell me what the poets are doin'
Don't tell me that they're talking tough
Don't tell me that they're anti-social
Somehow not anti-social enough, all right

And porn speaks to its splintered legions
To the pink amid the withered cornstalks in them winter regions (Yeah)
While aimin' at the archetypal father
He said with such broad and tentative swipes, "Why do you even bother?" (Yeah)

Don't tell me what the poets are doin'
Those Himalayas of the mind
Don't tell me what the poets been doin'
In the long grasses over time

Don't tell me what the poets are doin'
On the street and the epitome of vague
Don't tell me how the universe is altered
When you find out how he gets paid, all right

If there's nothing more that ya need now
The lawn cut by bare-breasted women
Beach bleached towels within reach for the women
Got to make it, that'll make it by swimmin'1Embed
