Chagrin Falls LyricsBy design, by neglect
For a fact or just for effect
When they met, where they connect
At the confluence of travel and sex
More a trip than a quest
Plunged into the deeply freckled breast
Where to now? If I had to guess
I'm afraid to say Antarctica's next
Or Chagrin Falls, Ohio
Where the unknown won't even go
To Chagrin Falls, Ohio
Where the unknown don't even go
Home's solitude with options
Artificial chaos isn't one of them
Return there crestfallen
Chagrin fell out of her apron
No profound sound, no special effects
The continent tipped and she just quietly left
Chagrin falls on our heads
Not in a gush but in maddening droplets
Chagrin falls (in Chagrin Falls, Ohio)
Chagrin Falls (where the unknown don't even go)
Chagrin falls (in Chagrin Falls, Ohio)
So falls Chagrin Falls (where the unknown don't even go)
So falls Chagrin Falls
So falls Chagrin FallsEmbed
