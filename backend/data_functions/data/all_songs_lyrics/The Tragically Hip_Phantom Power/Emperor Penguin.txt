Emperor Penguin LyricsI like the tone of your trumpet, come on let's spill some paint
Let's raise a glass of milk to the end of another day
And to the kiss that's still intangible, the kids are all right just unmanageable
They won't do a damn thing you say
Your voice is all detached on a radio wave breeze
We have another caller with a bachelor degree
Talking alien invasion is the only chance of unity
Well, sorry to interrupt you, caller, but that's a physical impossibility
That's a physical impossibility
That's a physical impossibility
You'd be tossed up or washed up, the narrator relates
In a spartan antarctican walk for many days
Meet with Emperor Penguin, devotion to the egg
And their women are swimming from half an ocean away
Don't sound so detached, this is you and me
Just give me your opinion before you turn to leave
Your crust is just incredible, the radio was edible
When you said don't wipe your arses with your sleeves
You're a physical impossibility
You're a physical impossibility
It was a physical impossibilityEmbed
