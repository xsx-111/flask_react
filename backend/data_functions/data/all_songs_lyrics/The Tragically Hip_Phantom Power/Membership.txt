Membership LyricsWhether laying down yourself beside it
Or slipping into its cool and rushing effects
Or drifting on it to where it broadens
Your admiration for, for it's more elusive aspects
Being drawn along by it
Carried under, carried away
By its long term membership
By the time the ice huts hit the bottom
We were already home in bed
The most worthy men and the fiercest architects
Couldn't fight the current, they couldn't save, they couldn't save the sheds
Being drawn along by it
Carried under, carried away
By its long term membership
Bring on the springtime, bring on the houseflies
Bring on the butterscotch, river over spilling its banks
If you've got you some withering power to amuse
You'll find its greatest frustration has its entertaining value
Being drawn along by it
Carried under, carried away
By its long term membership
Being drawn along by it
Carried under, carried away
By its long term membership
River wide, river wonder usEmbed
