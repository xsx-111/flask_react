Thompson Girl LyricsThompson Girl, I'm stranded at the Unique Motel
Thompson Girl, winterfighter's shot on the car as well
Looks like Christmas at fifty five degrees
This latitude weakens my knees, Thompson Girl
Grunt work somewhere between dream and duty
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty
Thompson Girl walking from Churchill
Across the icy world with polar bears it's mostly uphill
But when she saw that nickel stack
She whistled hard and I whistled back, Thompson Girl
Grunt work time between dream state and duty
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty
Grunt work somewhere between dream and duty
Poking through with all them shoots of beauty
Thompson Girl, we're down to the deadhouse plants
Thompson Girl, we've jettisoned everything we can
She says springtime's coming, wait till you see it
Poking through with them shoots of beauty
It's the end of rent-a-movie weather
It's time we end this siege together, Thompson Girl
Thompson Girl
