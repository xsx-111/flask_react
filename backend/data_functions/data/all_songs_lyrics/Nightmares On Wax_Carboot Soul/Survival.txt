Survival LyricsI've seen a man today...
Eating fromï»¿ a bin
And as he salvages;
Anything he can;
I suspect
Regret to recollect;
Now he's living in
A bottle like a model ship wreck
Where does he come from;
Where will he go?
A face without a name;
Survival!
The sun sets on the horizon
Rainbows lie on the horizon
A band of (?)
But the rest just keeps on surviving...
Survival!
I've seen a girl tonight...
Fixing her tights
And as she wanders...
Under the street lights
I'm certain
This is where she works well...
Like (?)...
Like a theater curtain...
Where does she come from?
Where will she go?
Until the break of dawn...
Survival!
The sun sets on the horizon
Rainbows lie on the horizon
A band of (?)
But the rest just keeps on surviving...
Survival!
I knew a family girl...
She now talks to herself
But I remember when...
She worked every hour of godsends...
All she wanted
Was to be successful
Round and round...
She went into the business carousel
Where does she come from?
Where will she go?
Is this madness?
Until survival?
The sun sets on the horizon
Rainbows lie on the horizon
A band of (?)
But the rest just keeps on surviving...
Survival!Embed
