Argha Noah LyricsThe waters of chaos
Were a blessing in fact
That brought new life
Each year
When the waters of the flood would recede
Leaving a course of fresh minerals and nutrients
In the waters
Which would then cause
The food to grow
And spring would be a beautiful time in Egypt
Because of the waters of chaos
They celebrated the coming of the waters of chaos
Bringing the new life
They call that celebration in Egypt
Meaning 'Argha Noah'
Not the 'Arc of Noah'
But 'Argha Noah'Embed
