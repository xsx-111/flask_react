Kansas Lyrics
I feel like I just woke up from a bad dream
And it's so good to have you sleepin' by my side

Although I'm not so sure
If I even know your name
Hold on, baby, hold on
We can go gliding through the air
Far from the tears you've cried

Yes, you're the one I'm talkin' to this mornin'
With your mind so kind and your friendly body lying

In my bungalow of stucco
That the glory and success spawned
Hold on, baby, hold on
It doesn't matter if you're the one
We'll know before we're doneEmbed
