Separate Ways Lyrics
I won't apologize
The light shone from in your eyes
It isn't gone
And it will soon come back again

Now we go our separate ways
Lookin' for better days
Sharin' our little boy
Who grew from joy back then

And it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Yes, it do, yes, it do
Oh
Well, it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Separate ways

Me for me, you for you
Happiness is never through
It's only a change of ways
And that is nothing new
I'm feelin' better now
I live more alive somehow
My eyes are opened
And my heart is pourin' through

And it's all because of that love we knew, babe
That makes the world go 'round
Yes, it do, yes, it do
Oh yes, it do
It's all because of that love for you, babe
Made the world go separate ways
Separate ways
Means that we'll go separate waysEmbed
