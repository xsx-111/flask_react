Love Is a Rose Lyrics
Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine

I want to see what's never been seen
I want to live that age old dream
Come on, lass, we can go together
Let's take the best right now
Take the best right now

I wanna go to an old hoedown
Long ago in a western town
Pick me up but my feet are dragging
Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon

Love is a rose but you better not pick it
It only grows when it's on the vine
A handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it
You lose your love when you say the word mine, mine, mine

Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a rose
Love is a roseEmbed
