Homegrown LyricsHomegrown's all right with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring
Sun comes up in the morning
And it shines that light around
One day, without no warning
Things start jumping up from the ground
Homegrown's all right with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring
Homegrown's all right with me
Homegrown is the way it should be
Homegrown is a good thing
Plant that bell and let it ring
Plant that bulb and let it growEmbed
