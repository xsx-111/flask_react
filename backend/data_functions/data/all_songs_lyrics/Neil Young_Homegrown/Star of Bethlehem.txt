Star of Bethlehem LyricsAin't it hard when you wake up in the morning
And you find out that those other days are gone?
All you have is memories of happiness lingering on
All your dreams and your lovers won't protect you
They're only passing through you in the end
They'll leave you stripped of all that they can get to
And wait for you to come back again
Yet still a light is shining from that lamp on down the hall
Maybe the star of Bethlehem wasn't a star at allEmbed
