Vacancy Lyrics
Who are you? Where are you goin' to?
What's your name? Why aren't you showin' through?
I look in your eyes and I don't know what's there
You poison me with that long, vacant stare
You dress like her and she walks in your words
You frown at me and then you smile at her

Are you my friend? Are you my enemy?
Can we pretend to live in harmony?
You come through in the weirdest way
You copy her with the words that you say
I need that girl like the night needs the day
I don't need you getting in my way


Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy
Vacancy, vacancy

Who are you? Where are you goin' to?
What's your name? Why aren't you showin' through?Embed
