Try LyricsDarlin', the door is open
To my heart and I've been hopin'
That you won't be the one
To struggle with the key
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
The waitin' time is over
No man sees around the corner
Walkin' in the rain and comin' home dry
There's something missin' there
It's easier to care and try
And I try to wash my hands (Ooh, ooh)
And I try to make amends (Ooh, ooh)
And I try to count my friends (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
I'd like to take a chance
But shit, Mary, I can't dance
So here's to lookin' up your old address
Golly what a mess
We gotta take the rest and try
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
We got lots of time
To get together if we try
(Ooh, ooh)Embed
