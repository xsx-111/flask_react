White Line Lyrics
I came to you when I needed a rest
You took my love and put it to the test
I saw some things that I never would have guessed
Well I've been down but I'm comin' back up again
And I'm rolling down the open road
Where my true love, she lies waiting
Right now I'm thinking 'bout these things I know
But the daylight will soon be breaking

You were my raft and I let you slide
It seemed like such a long easy ride
I was adrift on a river of pride
Feels like a railroad, I pull a whole load behind me
That ol' white line is a friend of mine
And its good time that we've been making
Right now I'm thinking 'bout those things that I know
But the daylight will soon be breakin'
