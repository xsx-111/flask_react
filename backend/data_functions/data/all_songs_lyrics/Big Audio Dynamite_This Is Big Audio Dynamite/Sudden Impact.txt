Sudden Impact LyricsListening to a metal music prank that leads straight to the bank
Each grunt and groan took literally some tired old rock star's fantasy
Suburbia is such a drag, bargain nightmares in a bag
Newspapers sell disaster and sin, and when the dust storm comes they say the Devil rides in
Party down, eat your friend, be -movie stories never end
Rock the house, shoot your mum, cheap thrills wrapped up in bubblegum
Get down, burn the cat, the hardcore life is where it's at
Love boat, sub attack, beware of sudden impact
Burnt out case from the neighborhood, converge one night deep in the wood
The bat from hell arrived that night to make that picnic outtasite
Satanic rights to a tune they knew well to make the party rock like hell
Hold tight the ride begins, macho men with pimply skin
Party down, eat your friend, be -movie stories never end
Rock the house, shoot your mum, cheap thrills wrapped up in bubblegum
Get down, burn the cat, the hardcore life is where it's at
Love boat, sub attack, beware of sudden impact
Come fly with me, talk to the trees, the dust storm doesn't always please
That's the gamble inside your head, let's play something else instead
Hide and seek for a shock, I can see right through that rock
Bang, you're dead the shit is real, someones scored a bum deal
Party down, eat your friend, be -movie stories never end
Rock the house, shoot your mum, cheap thrills wrapped up in bubblegum
Get down, burn the cat, the hardcore life is where it's at
Love boat, sub attack, beware of sudden impact
Teenage shrinks are all confused at the spread of drug abuse
Meanwhile down at the games arcade the latest candies are displayed
Guess what our kids got really cheap, the stuff that puts the elephants to sleep
Not paradise but blown to hell, they took their sabbath tapes as well
Party down, eat your friend, be -movie stories never end
Rock the house, shoot your mum, cheap thrills wrapped up in bubblegum
Get down, burn the cat, the hardcore life is where it's at
Love boat, sub attack, beware of sudden impactEmbed
