BAD Lyrics(Go ahead London)
Bad life, bad language
Bad news, bad
When I'm at home my woman won't leave me alone
And that's bad, so bad
So I walked out of the door, and it seemed worse than before
And that's bad, so bad
And the thought occurred to me, how come that everything you see
Is so bad, so bad?
But before I realised, hit by a truck and paralyzed
And that's bad, so bad
A golden opportunity claim, my insurance policy
Hmmmmm... so bad
These are the things that drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)
These are the things that make me bad
(Go ahead, London)
(Crazy)
Watch TV go goggle-eyed
See a horror movie, get petrified
Go dye your hair, use peroxide
Smoke a spliff and get red eye
Hitler wanted to commit genocide
To the allied powers he notified
Went into Poland, the place he occupied
They all had a war and millions died
Jerry Lee Lewis had a child bride
Only thirteen, but he said he's justified
Clint Eastwood starred on Rawhide
Now he lives in California off a mountain side
Making love you got to be satisfied
Make a mistake it's got to be rectified
Jesus Christ got crucified
So the empire Rome could get gratified
These are the things that drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)
These are the things that make me bad
(Make me bad)
(Crazy)
From the dancefloor I can see decadent society
And that's bad, so bad
As diverse as it could be, it's still cold and empty
And that's bad, so bad
There's the floor, that's the score
You don't like it, there's the door
And that's bad, so bad
Attitudes of some would say, "I got money, I'm okay"
And that's bad, so bad
These are the things that drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)
These are the things that make me bad
(Bad)
(Crazy)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Do it, do it, do it
Got to modify your wheels if you want a low ride
On the windscreen says tax applied
Play your music loud well amplified
Each selection bona-fide
Hawaii 5 0 deals with homicide
On the slab the victims get mortified
Some people like to eat Kentucky Fried
Others like a Big Mac and french fries
Nation's economy is on a downward slide
On the best course of action no one can decide
Company cheques got to be verified
Poor people got no money, but they got their pride
Cop on wheels is Ironside
East, sleep, work, cheap, nine to five
Reagan won in a landslide
Which brings us back to Rawhide
(Rawhide)
These are the things that drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)
These are the things that make me bad
(Make me bad)
(Crazy, crazy)
(Go ahead, London)
(Crazy, crazy)
These are the things that drive me crazy
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)
This is so fucking badEmbed
