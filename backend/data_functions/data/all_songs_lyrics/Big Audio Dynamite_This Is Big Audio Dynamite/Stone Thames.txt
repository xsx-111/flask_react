Stone Thames LyricsHeard the news about the scare in the underwear
Population's getting thin, forget the bomb, it's carnal sin, yeah
Marriage up, divorce is down, who wants to fuck around
Save the rose, reject romance, Mickey Mouse don't drop his pants
Now to sexual relations better take a wife
Now that sex is death, better lead a boring life
No time for social kissing, you'll hardly raise a smile
When you think what you'll be missing, iron undies back in style
Now where did it start, and where will it end?
Be nice to the wife, can't trust your friends
Masculine natural nowadays can offend
Never gonna fall in love again
No no no
Seems like only yesterday, cocaine and ecstasy
Run around and jump on anything you see
A marriage of convenience, saw a doctor went abroad
Saved up a few pennies, ran the wheelchair down to Lourdes
Now handsome is as handsome does, and I did it everywhere
Before the current era I didn't have a care
Bloodstream destination, megavitamin therapy
Artificial insemination, D.I.Y. vasectomy
Oh spaceman, junkfood Dallas, the 20th century
Two World Wars, a Great Depression, this must be Germ War III
Now where did it start, and where will it end?
Be nice to the wife, can't trust your friends
Masculine natural nowadays can offend
Never gonna fall in love again
No no no
No need for alimony 'cause no one wants to split
Leisure time's a gamble, but jogging keeps you fit
Now I packed my bags for China, join the yellow race
Nostradamus had a theory, they're inheriting the place
Blamed it on the Haliens, C.I.A, and KGB
Arclight a-shining down on monogamy
New date really hard, promiscure? Change your views
Unless you got a health card, take a tip from Howard Hughes
Oh Trocadero Transfer, I-Beam closet scene
Cat and mouse with the press, expos√© celebrity
Now where did it start, and where will it end?
Be nice to the wife, can't trust your friends
Masculine natural nowadays can offend
Never gonna fall in love again
No no no
The tramp of time continues, en masse to wedding bells
But they haven't made no breakthrough to helper T white cells
Wholesale hyper wipe out, technology against the pest
Put away those etchings, sorry baby, no contest
Notches and phone numbers, collecting flesh as pelts
Stealing cancer's thunder, blows below the belt
Oh, don't it make you wonder 'bout how the cards are dealt
Holy cow
Now where did it start, and where will it end?
Be nice to the wife, can`t trust your friends
Masculine natural nowadays can offend
Never gonna fall in love againEmbed
