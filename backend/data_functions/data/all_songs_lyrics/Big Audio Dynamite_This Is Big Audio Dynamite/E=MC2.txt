E=MC2 Lyrics
"Why don't you play us a tune, pal?"
"I don't like music."
"Comical little geezer. You'll look funny when you're fifty."

Somebody I never met, but in a way I know
Didn't think that you could get so much from a picture show
Man dies first reel, people ask, "What's the deal?
This ain't how it's supposed to be; Don't like no Aborigine"
Took a trip in Powis Square, pop star dyed his hair
No fans to scream and shout when mobsters came to flush him out
Gangland slaying underground; new identity must be found
On the left bank for a while, insanity Bohemian style

Ritual ideas, relativity
Holy buildings, no people prophecy
Time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
Foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho...

Met a dwarf that was no good, dressed like little Red Riding Hood
Bad habit taking life, her calling card a six-inch knife
Ran off really fast, mumbled something 'bout the past
Best sex I've ever seen, as if each moment was the last
Drops of blood, colour slide, funeral for his bride
But it's him who's really dead - gets to take the funeral ride
Ritual ideas, relativity
Holy buildings, no people prophecy
Time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
Foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho...
Oh-ho
Oh-ho
Oh-ho...

"You know, I don't think I'm going to let you stay in the film business."
"Time for a change!"
"I like a bit of a cavort. I don't send 'em solicitor's letters. I apply a bit of.... pressure."

Space guy fell from the sky, scratched my head and wondered why
Time slides into time across international dateline
Scientist eats bubblegum; hall of fame, baseball
Senator's a hoodlum, big chiefs in the hall

Ritual ideas, relativity
Holy buildings, no people prophecy
Time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
Foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho...
Stray thoughts fear to tread, placed upon the screen instead
She's my flame too hot to hold - had to settle for her cold
Bloodlust, Greek god, gold discovery
Gone bust, tight wad, slow recovery
Axe job, flame thrower, iron bar and gun
Betting shop, new owner, a walk in the sun

Ritual ideas, relativity
Holy buildings, no people prophecy
Time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
Foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho...

Spread the news: the Maestro's back, with a beat-box soundtrack
The King of brains, Queen of the sack; executives have heart attack
It's assault course celluloid the money makers would avoid
Sometimes notions get reversed - centre of the universe

Ritual ideas, relativity
Holy buildings, no people prophecy
Time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
Foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho...
Oh-ho
Oh-ho
Oh-ho...

"Who do you think you are, the Lone Ranger?
You're Jack the Lad!"
""Putting a little stick about. Putting the frighteners on flash, little twerps."
"He's an ignorant boy. An out of date boy."
"United we stand, divided we're lumbered."
"At the death, who is left holding the sodding baby?"
"I know a thing or two about the client√®le. They're a bunch of liars and wrigglers. Give 'em a bit of stick."

Ritual ideas, relativity
Holy buildings, no people prophecy
Time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
Foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho...
Oh-ho...

Ritual ideas, relativity
Holy buildings, no people prophecy
Time slide, place to hide, nudge reality
Foresight, minds wide, magic imagery, oh-ho...
Oh-ho...Embed
