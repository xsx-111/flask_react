Flag of Hate Lyrics
Dark shadows lie over the city
Tonight someone will die, you can hear
Some painful scream the air is full of flies
The mayhemic legions are ready to steal the human souls
Come into my vault and do what you have been told

I'll eat your intestines no matter if you pray or please
I'll bring you down to your knees
Tonight you're gonna meet your fate
You'll try to run but it's too late
I am here to liquidate

Time to raise the Flag Of Hate
Destroy the world is our only aim
To strike them down is the only way
To make 'em dead and let them pay

The galleys of the underground sail on the sea of blood
All that we want; crucify your god
The poseurs on this earth have no right to live
We gonna split their brains torture is what we give
I'll eat your intestines no matter if you pray or please
I'll bring you down to your knees
Tonight you're gonna meet your fate
You'll try to run but it's too late
I am here to liquidate

Time to raise the Flag Of Hate
Destroy the world is our only aim
To strike them down is the only way
To make 'em dead and let them payEmbed
