Carrion LyricsLights are flashing down the alleys
The reaper has arrived
The medieval brutality is still alive
The death machines of one
Hundred countries are ready to strike
No remorse no mercy only hate is in their eyes
Satan and his legions will be their guides
He'll make the world a slave to his hellish might
Reaching out for your life
The world is prepared to die
Death will fall from the sky
And the reaper will arrive
Open your eyes if you can
And see everything burn
Zombies will come out
Of their graves to
See the corpses turn
The world is at an end
And there is no return
Don't try to run or escape the final death
Death is a part of your life you should be glad
Black rain is falling down
And the moon is turning red
Hear the sound of bombs as they fall
Don't cry you'll die so crawl
Fear the next day if you survive
'Cause there ain't no place for new life
No escape nothing there no way
Out to save your life
The strong and weak all will
Fall prepare yourself to die
Screams of despair screams of pain
You hear it everywhere
Wait for god if there is one
But even he doesn't care
Reaching out for your life
The world is prepared to die
Death will fall from the sky
And the reaper will arriveEmbed
