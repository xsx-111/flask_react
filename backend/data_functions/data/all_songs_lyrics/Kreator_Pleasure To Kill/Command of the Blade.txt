Command of the Blade LyricsMist is falling as he rides over the land
With his blade of steel
He is coming to take you
He has seen the battles of the damned
He lost and won
He is coming to break your
Flesh and bones
Scared to scream, scared to cry
Await your fate, no one will save you
You're damned to die
Warrior of the king, mission to kill
Death to all
His aim is to give you
Command of the blade
When you fall his mission is complete
He's gonna get you
Command of the blade!
His care is black, his eyes are glowing red
He's seeking for you, he wants to rape you
His lifeless body has decayed long ago
His skeleton's riding
Coming to break your
Neck and back
Scared to scream, too late to cry
Your fate is here, you hear his steps
Now you die!
Warrior of the king, mission to kill
Death to all
His aim is to give you
Command of the blade
He will laugh as you fall
His aim is to give you
Death!
When you die by his blade
Your corpse'll lie here to decay
No one will miss your dumb face
No one be left there to pray
The kreator rides back to his kingdom
To receive another command
Soon he will be back here
To conquer and rule over the land!
Command of the bladeEmbed
