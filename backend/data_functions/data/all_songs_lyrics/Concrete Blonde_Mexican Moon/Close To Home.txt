Close To Home LyricsTennessee, Baton Rouge
Dallas, Texas
Coming through
New Orleans, I could stay
But tomorrow I'm on my way
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm getting closer and closer to home
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm getting closer and closer to home
I been here
I been there
I been nowhere
Everywhere
Mexico, I could stay
Arizona to L.A
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm getting closer and closer to home
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm getting closer and closer to home
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm getting closer and closer to home
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm getting closer and closer to home
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm getting closer and closer to home
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm close to home (close to home)
I'm getting closer and closer to homeEmbed
