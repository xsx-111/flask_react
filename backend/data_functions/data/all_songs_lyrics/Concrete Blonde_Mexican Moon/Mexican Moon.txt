Mexican Moon LyricsOh, amigo
Here we do things slow
Money, art, a broken heart
Where did you want to go?
Se単or, por favor
To the hotel Zona Rosa
What did I come here for?
Oh, se単or
I run, but the damage has been done
Miles have gone away
And my amor, he never come
I look up at the sky
I am tired and dry
Uno Tecate and lime
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moon
Se単or, you are wise
I can see a million years
A million tears behind your eyes
Take me home
Take me to the Zona Rosa
Mariachis and tequila
I will dance the night alone
Just some time
Just a little kiss of mine
Take me where I can forget, se単or
You are so very kind
I look up at the sky
I am tired and dry
Dos Tecate and lime
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moon
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moon
I look up at the sky
I will try not to cry
Tres Tecate and lime
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moon
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moon
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moonlight
Thinking of you
Underneath the Mexican moonEmbed
