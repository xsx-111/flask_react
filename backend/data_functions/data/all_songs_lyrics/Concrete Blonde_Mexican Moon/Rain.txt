Rain LyricsRain
Thought I heard a footstep
Thought I heard the phone
Standing on the doorstep
Listening alone
And all I hear is rain
Thought I saw your headlight
Thought I heard your car
Shadows on the streetlights
Fog and nothing more
And all I hear is rain
And things I tried to say
Tried as many times
This rain is falling from my eyes
These kinds of days (I really miss you now)
Seasons are changed again (I really miss you now)
I search in vain
I wonder where you are
Watching the rain
And it makes me remember
Things I tried to say
Rain
Laughing at the window
Thought I saw your face
Only cloudy images
On my window pane
And all I hear is rain
And things I tried to sayEmbed
