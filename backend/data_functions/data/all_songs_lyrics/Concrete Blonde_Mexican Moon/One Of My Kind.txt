One Of My Kind Lyrics
Johnette Napolitano: Have a drink, Tex
Texarcana Jones: Ooh, yummy! That looks good

I go on a date with you
Get me to the party before it's too late
So I can watch all the evil in the room
Get up and dance while he's still fresh
And he's still all in love with his first steady
If not, let me know
Cause I'd rather stay home than go
Shadows, windows
Sorrow like an undertow
Clotheslines, telephone lines
It's a matter of time before they find me
I'm waiting for a sign from one of my kind
I'm waiting for the time to fall behind me
I'm waiting for a sign from one of my kind
Get on the plane
A star in the sky
Down and living and dying inside
Slipping on the wire and jumping off the ledge
I feel like dancing out over the edge
Weeping willow
Weeping on my pillow
Headlines, deadlines
Wine, dine, do a line
Nickel and dime me
I've been waiting for a sign from one of my kind
I'm waiting for the time to fall behind me
I've been waiting for a sign from one of my kind
Oh, no ?
Soon we flew from our cocoon
We go slow
I'm wondering how long until they find me
I've been waiting for a sign from one of my kind
It's a matter of time until they find me
I've been waiting for a sign from one of my kind
Waiting for a sign from one of my kind
Waiting for a sign from one of my kind
Waiting for a sign from one of my kind
Waiting for a sign from one of my kindEmbed
