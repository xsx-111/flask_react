I Call It Love LyricsIf you listen to the ocean
And the rhythm of the rain
And the rhythm of a heartbeat
And ? you again
And you do not see the color
And you do not see the reason
And you do not understand these things
You only know religion
And the wisdom of the ages
Meets the wisdom of the moment
And the future past and present
Is the feeling or the touch
And the walking hand you feel it
And it follows like a wind
And the voices in your ear
Are telling you so much
Some call it Allah
Some call it God
Some call it Buddha
I call it Love
Some call it power
Come from above
Some call it Jesus
I call it Love
When you're guilty of compassion
It's the border of ?
On the international
Binding us together
When the song is all around you
Telling you be free
And the force has finally found you
And it's everything you need
Some call it Allah
Some call it God
Some call it Buddha
I call it Love
Some call it power
Come from above
Some call it Jesus
I call it Love
Some call it Allah
Some call it God
Some call it Buddha
I call it Love
Some call it power
Come from above
Some call it Jesus
I call it Love
Some call it power
Come from above
Some call it Jesus
I call it Love
Some call it Allah
Some call it JesusEmbed
