(Love Is A) Blind Ambition LyricsAnd all the minutes
Of all the madness
And all the poetry
Between the good and badness
And all the hours
Of all the minutes
Of all the thousand loves
That grew from within
It was the heat of the night
And love was a blind ambition
And all the seasons
All the years
Of all countless questions
And seasons of fear
There's an answer
And all emotion
And all the hungry moments
A losing proposition
It's just the heat of the night
'Cause love is a blind ambition
It's just the heat of the night
'Cause love is a blind ambition
And all the minutes
Of all the madness
And all the poetry
Between the good and badness
And all the hours
Of all the minutes
And all the flowers of love
And the love that grew from within it
It was the heat of the night
And love was a blind ambition
It was the heat of the night
And love was a blind ambitionEmbed
