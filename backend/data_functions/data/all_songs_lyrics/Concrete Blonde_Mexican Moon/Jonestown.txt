Jonestown LyricsSheep are running scared tonight
The cows are coming home
They cling together terrified
Afraid to be alone
The bees are buzzing around the queen
Waiting for a word
The ? are ? the scene?
Collectively absurd
They're looking for Jesus
They're looking for more
Just what are they looking up here to me for
They're looking for someone
They're looking for Christ
They're looking for some human sacrifice
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown
They don't know who to run to
They don't know where to go
Unless you tell them what to think
They don't know what they know
Repeating the commercial
Something they have heard
From someone not they someone else
Somebody good with words
I think they're looking for an answer
They're looking for more
Just what are they looking up here to me for
They're looking for Jesus
They're looking for Christ
They're looking for some human sacrifice
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown again
It looks like Jonestown again
They're looking for an answer
They're looking for more
Just what are you looking up here to me for
They're looking for Jesus
They're praying for Christ
They're looking for some human sacrifice
It looks like Jonestown
It looks like Jonestown
It looks like Jonestown
It looks like Jonestown
Jonestown
