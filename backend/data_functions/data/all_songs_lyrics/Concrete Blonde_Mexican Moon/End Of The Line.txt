End Of The Line LyricsTake a walk out in the rain
Called you time and time again
Everything is wrong
You've gone
Reached the point of no return
The more I see the more I stand alone
I see the end of the line
Were you ever lonely
Mystified and blue
Realizing only
Your number's up
You're through
Had my share of winning
Now's my time to lose
After a fair beginning
The game's up
You're through
Think I'll walk out in the storm
Got no love to keep me warm inside
I see the end of the line
Now's the time to take a dive
Take a magic carpet ride
Everything is wrong
You've gone
If you ever miss me
If I should cross your mind
You know where to find me
I'll be waiting at the end of the line1Embed
