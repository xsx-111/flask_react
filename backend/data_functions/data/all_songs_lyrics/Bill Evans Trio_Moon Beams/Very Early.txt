Very Early LyricsEarly morning... first light dawning
Time to just lay 'round
Dreamy traces... sleepy faces
Time to just lay a-round
 daylight stealing... cozy feeling
Where is there to go?
Darkness waning... conscious gaining
Time's a-wasting, I know
When I try to leave my hideout
Fingers start to ride out
Tug me back like a string
Covers hide me... love beside me
Very early
Restful slumber... that's my number
Think I'll just lay 'round
Dozing/waking... sleep's not taking
Why should I stick a-round?
 stretching, yawning... stirring, spawning
What is there to do?
Shadowed ceiling... lovin' feeling
Love, so shiny and new
Pretty silhouette begins to...
Clutch her downy pillow
How my heart wants to sing 
Love awakens here beside me
Very early, oh so early, early mornin' thingEmbed
