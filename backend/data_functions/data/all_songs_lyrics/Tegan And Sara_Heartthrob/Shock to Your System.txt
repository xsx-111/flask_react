Shock to Your System Lyrics
You seem like you're so restless, young at heart
Who gave you reason?
You should be out driving people wild
Who gave you reason?

You got a shock to your system
Knocked your heart right out of sync

You're only meant to hurt once in a while
Who gave you reason?
You're only meant to cry once in a while
Who gave you reason?

You got a shock to your system
Pull yourself out of it
I know that shock to your system
Knocked your heart right out of sync

What you are
What you are
What you are is lonely
What you are
What you are is lonely
What you are
You must rely on love once in a while
To give you reason
You must rely on me once in a while
To give you reason

You got a shock to your system
Pull yourself out of it
I know that shock to your system
Knocked your heart right out of sync

What you are
What you are
What you are is lonely
What you are
What you are is lonely
What you are is lonely
What you are is lonely1Embed
