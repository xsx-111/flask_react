Drove Me Wild Lyrics
When I think of you I think of your skin
Golden brown from the sun
Your arms outstretched, your hair cut shorter than it'd been
But still blowing in the wind
When I picture you I think of your smile
And it drives me wild
Your laugh escaping you, your head thrown to the side
And it drives me wild

You carried romance in the palm of your hand
You called the plays for us
You clung to self restraint, you followed the plan
You put the brakes on this
And it drove me and it drove me and it drove me wild

When I envision you I think of your sheets
Tangled up beneath me
Your body inching close, closer to the edge
I got a hold of you then
When I imagine you I think of that room
And it drives me wild
Your face relaxed, your voice a whisper in my ear
And it drives me wild
You carried romance in the palm of your hand
You called the plays for us
You clung to self restraint, you followed the plan
You put the brakes on this
And it drove me and it drove me and it drove me wild

I would have had us swerving through those streets
Over and over
I would have stalled or rushed us through those greens
Over and over
But you knew that (you drove me wild)
And you wouldn't let me lose control (you drove me wild)
Control (you drove me wild)

You carried romance in the palm of your hand
You called the plays for us
You clung to self restraint, you followed the plan
You put the brakes on this
And it drove me and it drove me and it drove me wild
You carried romance in the palm of your hand
You called the plays for us (you drove me wild)
You clung to self restraint, you followed the plan
You put the brakes on this (you drove me wild)
And it drove me and it drove me and it drove me wild
And it drove me and it drove me and it drove me wild3Embed
