I Run Empty Lyrics
Lean these pictures up against the wall
Won’t remain in this room too long
I count steps and sockets in the wall
To avoid the sound
Of your feet missing in the hall
To avoid the sound
Of your feet missing in the hall

Don’t think I didn't deserve what I got
Don’t think I didn't deserve what I lost
I run empty until I
I feel nothing inside
I run empty until I
I feel nothing inside
Oh, don’t think I didn't deserve what I got

Think nothing of mistakes that I've made
All around change that I can’t take
The way I left you hanging every time
You avoid the sound
Of my voice coming down the line
You avoid the sound
Of my voice coming down the line
Don’t think I didn't deserve what I got
Don’t think I didn't deserve what I lost
I run empty until I
I feel nothing inside
I run empty until I
I feel nothing inside
Oh, don’t think I didn't deserve what I got

We were still so young, wasn't certain of anything
When you’re still so young, can’t be certain of anything
Can’t be certain of anything, when you’re young
