Goodbye, Goodbye Lyrics
Goodbye, I don't wanna
Feel the need to hear your voice
Goodbye, I don't wanna
Feel the need to see your face

I can't live with
All these things I would say
I can't live with
All these things that I'd say

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

You never really knew me, never, ever
Never, ever saw me, saw me like they did
You never really loved me, never really
Never really loved me, loved me like they did
With some time, I might wanna
See the way that you've changed
With some time, I might wanna
See how you fared what you can't replace

I can't stand it
All these things I've let go
I can't stand it
All these things I've let go

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

You never really knew me, never, ever
Never, ever saw me, saw me like they did
You never really loved me, never really
Never really loved me, loved me like they did
You could have told me goodbye
You could have told me goodbye

You let me try knowing there was
Nothing I could do to change you
You could have warned me
Knowing there was nothing I could do to change you

You never really knew me, never, ever
Never, ever saw me, saw me like they did
You never really loved me, never really
Never really loved me, loved me like they did

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Like the first time

You never really knew me, never, ever
Never, ever saw me, saw me like they did
You never really loved me, never really
Never really loved me, loved me like they did1Embed
