I Was a Fool Lyrics
Do you remember I searched you out
How I climbed your city's walls
Do you remember me as devout?
How I prayed for your calls

I stood still, it's what I did
Love like ours is never fixed

I stuck around
I did behave
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love
I was a fool for love
I was a fool
I was a fool

Then you blamed me and blocked me out
How long did you think I'd last?
Then you disappeared for weeks to pout
How many times could I pack?

But (But) stand (stand) still is what I did
(It's all I did)
Love (Love) like (like) ours is never fixed
(It's never fixed)
Still I stuck around
I did behave
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love
I was a fool for love
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)

If you're worried that I might have changed
Left behind all of my foolish ways
You best be looking for somebody else
Without a foolish heart
A foolish heart

But (But) stand (stand) still is what we did
(It's all we did)
Love (Love) like (like) ours is never fixed
(It's never fixed)

I stuck around
I did behave
I saved you every time
I was a fool for love (I was a fool)
I was a fool for love
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)
I was a fool (I was a fool for love)7Embed
