Guilty As Charged Lyrics
Guilty as charged, you were on my mind
Try as I might I can't seem to lie
I can love you back if you like
I can hold you back if you like

And so I go back home to be by myself
I try everything I've ever read
Desperate, I still can't get you out of my head
Because you're on my mind
All the time
Now you're on my mind
All the time

A blessing in disguise I was on your mind
Try as you might you may well soon find
I am yours but you can't be mine
I am sure you'll always be mine

And so I go back home to be by myself
I try everything I've ever read
Desperate, I still can't get you out of my head
And so I stay at home alone with myself
I read through everything I've ever said
Desperate, I still can't get you out of my head
Because you're on my mind
All the time
Now you're on my mind
All the time
Crazy, crazy
I'm crazy about you

Caught in the act, you were on my mind
Lucky for you, now I'm on your mind
And so I go back home to be by myself
I try everything I've ever read
Desperate, I still can't get you out of my head

Because you're on my mind
All the time
Now you're on my mind
All the time

Because you're on my mind
(Crazy, crazy, crazy for you)
All the time
Now you're on my mind
(Crazy, crazy, crazy for you)
All the time
Because you're on my mind
(Crazy, crazy, crazy for you)
Always on my mind1Embed
