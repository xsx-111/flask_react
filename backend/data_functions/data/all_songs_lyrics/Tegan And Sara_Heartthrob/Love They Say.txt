Love They Say Lyrics
The first time I saw your face I knew I was meant for you
The first time you said my name I knew I was meant for you

Love, they say it heals all wounds
Love removes the hurt in you
Love, I know that this is true
Love, they say that it is blind
Love, they say it all the time
Love, I know that they are right

(Love, they say this)
You don't need to wonder (Love, they say this)
If love will make us stronger (Love, they say)
There's nothing love can't do
(Love, they say this)
You don't need to worry (Love, they say this)
This love will make us worthy (Love, they say)
There's nothing love can't do

The first time you held my hand I knew I was meant for you
The first time you kissed my lips I knew I was meant for you
Love, they say there's only one
Love, the kind that's not undone
Love, I know you are the one

(Love, they say this)
You don't need to wonder (Love, they say this)
If love will make us stronger (Love, they say)
There's nothing love can't do
(Love, they say this)
You don't need to worry (Love, they say this)
This love will make us worthy (Love, they say)
There's nothing love can't do

I know they'll say that we're crazy
Tell them there is nothing love can't do
I know you'll say that we're crazy

Love, they say it heals all wounds
Love removes the hurt in you
Love, I know that this is true
Love, they say there's only one
Love, the kind that's not undone
Love, I know you are the one
(Love, they say this)
You don't need to wonder (Love, they say this)
If love will make us stronger (Love, they say)
There's nothing love can't do (You don't have to wonder)
(Love, they say this)
You don't need to worry (Love, they say this)
This love will make us worthy (Love, they say)
There's nothing love can't do (You don't have to worry)
(Love, they say this)
You don't need to wonder (Love, they say this)
If love will make us stronger (Love, they say)
There's nothing love can't do (You don't have to wonder)
(Love, they say this)
You don't need to worry (Love, they say this)
This love will make us worthy (Love, they say)
There's nothing love can't do (You don't have to worry)
There's nothing love can't do
There's nothing love can't do
There's nothing love can't doEmbed
