Who Do You Love LyricsI walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house by the roadside
Made outta rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of a human skull
Come on take a little walk with me, baby
And tell me, who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mine
Just 22 and I don't mind dying
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Goin' round this town, take a rattlesnake whip
Come on baby, don't give me no lip
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Night was black, sky was blue
Round the corner, ice-wagon flew
Heard a bump, heard a scream
You should have seen just what I seen
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
My baby took me by the hand
And said come on baby, I understand
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
That's very nice!
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?Embed
