Smokestack Lightning (Live) LyricsYeah, smokestack lightning
Don't you hear me callin'?
Don't you hear me callin'?
Tell me where did you go last night?
I gotta know who you've been with
Tell me where did you go last night?
You gotta stop your train
Let me go for a ride, pretty baby, you know
Stop your train, I gotta ride with you
I gotta ride with you
I gotta ride with you
Fare you well, goodbye, pretty baby
Fare you well, goodbye, goodbye
Never see you no more, pretty baby, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Yeah, smokestack lightning
Shining like gold
Don't you hear me callin'?
You gotta stop your train, let me go for a ride
I gotta ride with you
Stop your train and ride with youEmbed
