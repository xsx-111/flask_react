I Got Love If You Want It Lyrics
Got love if you want it, babe
Got love if you want it, babe
Got love if you want it
Got love if you want it
Got love if you want it, babe
We could rock all the while
We could rock all the while
Quit teasing me baby
Quit teasing me baby
With your fine diamond ring
With your fine diamond ring
You know if you'd love me babe
I'd give you everything
I'd give you everything
Now here you come baby
Now here you come baby
With your head hanging down
With your head hanging down
I know you've been balling, babe
Talk's all over town
Talk's all over town

Our next door neighbour
Our next door neighbour
Peeping through her blind
Peeping through her blind
I know you've been cheating baby
That's how long it shines
I love you little woman
I love you little woman
I want you to myself
I want you to myself
I know you've been cheating me babe
For somebody else
For somebody else
For somebody else
For somebody elseEmbed
