Five Long Years Lyrics
Have you ever been mistreated?
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Well, I worked five long years for my girl
She had the nerve to put me out

I got a job in a steel mill, shucking steel like a slave
Five years and every Friday I walk in, bring home my pay
Have you ever been mistreated?
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Well, I worked five long years for one girl
She had the nerve to put me out

I finally learned my lesson
Should a long time ago
The next little girl that I marry
She gonna work and bring me some dough
If you've ever been mistreated
Do you know just what I'm talking about?
I worked five long years for one girl
She had the nerve to put me out

I finally learned my lesson
Should a long time ago
The next girl that I marry
She gonna work and bring me some dough
If you've ever been mistreated
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Well I worked five long years for one girl
She had the nerve
She had the nerve to put me outEmbed
