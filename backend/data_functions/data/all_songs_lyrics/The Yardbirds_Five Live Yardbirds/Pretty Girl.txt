Pretty Girl Lyrics
Pretty girl, damn shame
You let those homely girls come and take your man
Pretty baby, well, you know, you're looking good
Oh, but these homely girls, they're gonna wreck this neighborhood

Pretty girl, better watch yourself
Because these homely girls will leave you on the shelf
Pretty baby, yeah, you know you're looking fine
Oh, but these homely girls got a marrying man changing his mind

Homely baby
(Pretty baby)
Pretty baby
(Homely baby)
Homely baby
(Pretty baby)
Told you just what to do

Pretty girl, better watch your man
Because these homely girls are raising Cain
Pretty baby, oh, you know you're the real McCoy
Oh, but these homely girls got a marrying man jumping for joy


Pretty girl, you're looking good
Oh, well these homely girls will wreck this neighborhood
Pretty baby, ah, you know she's the real McCoy
Oh, well these homely girls got a marrying man jumping for joy
