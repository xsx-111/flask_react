Let It Rock LyricsIn the evening of the day down in Mobile, Alabama
Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer
Gotta get some money to buy some brand new shoes
Gotta find somebody to lose these blues
"She don't love me" hear me singing in the sun
She better leave me 'til my work is all done
In the evening of the day, when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a teepee built out on the track
Rolling bones 'til the foreman comes back
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles out
Everybody's scrambling and running around
Picking up their money, take the teepee down
Foreman wants to panic, 'bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blown his whistle loud and long
He can't stop the train, gotta let it roll onEmbed
