Louise Lyrics
Oh, Louise
Yes, you're the sweetest girl that I know
Don't you know now, Louise
You are the sweetest girl that I know
You made me walk from Chicago
Oh, to the Gulf of Mexico
Now you know Louise
She's like a rolling stone
Every time she leave a man
He had to grieve alone

Oh, Louise
Why don't you hurry home?
You know I never had no good loving
Oh, Louise, since you been gone

Got a girl called Mindy
Treat me nice and kind
Don't do what you're doing
'Cos Louise is on my mind

Now Louise ain't so good looking
And her hair ain't red
But she cooks my breakfast
And brings it to my bed, oh Louise


Oh Louise, why don't you hurry home?
You made me walk from Chicago
Oh, to the Gulf of MexicoEmbed
