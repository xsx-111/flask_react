Too Much Monkey Business Lyrics
Runnin' to-and-fro
Hard workin' in the mill
Never fail in the mail
Yeah, come a rotten bill

Too much monkey business
For me to be involved in!

Salesman talkin' to me
Tryin' to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it, go on try it
You can pay me next week, ahh


Blond hair, good lookin'
Tryin' to get me hooked
Want me to marry, get a home
Settle down, write a book

Every day, same thing
Gettin' up, goin' to school
No need for me complaining
My objection's overruled, ahh


Telephone, something wrong
Dime gone, will mail
Oughtta sue the operator
For telling me a tale, ahh


I been to Yokohama
Been fightin' in the war
Army bunk, army crew
Army food, army corps, aah


Workin' in the fillin' station
Too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tyres
Check the oil, a dollar gas
