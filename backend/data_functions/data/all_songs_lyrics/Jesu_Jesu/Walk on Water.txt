Walk on Water LyricsBe there for your summer
Be dead by the winter
Be there for the summer
Be dead by your winter
Be there for the summer
Be dead by your winter
Be there for the summer
Be dead by your winter
Be there for your summer
Be dead by your winter
--
Be there for your summer
Be dead by your winter
Be there for your summer
Be dead by your winter
Be there, walk on water
Be dead, walk on water
Be there for your summer
Be there for your summer. (x8)Embed
