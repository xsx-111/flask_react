Friends Are Evil Lyrics

I know the stones I've thrown
They come back twice as strong
I know the stones I've thrown
Tell me that nothing lasts

I know stones you've thrown
Come from your highest throne
Pass them on to me below
They remind me nothing lasts

I know the stones I've thrown
They come back twice as strong
I know the stones I've thrown
They tell me nothing lasts

I know stones you've thrown
They come from your highest throne
Pass them on to me below
They remind me nothing lasts
NothingEmbed
