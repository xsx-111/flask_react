We All Faulter LyricsAnd you're a disease
And you're a disease that I'm underneath
And you're just like
And you're just like all the rest
'Cause we all falter
'Cause we all falter
Lay the blame
Lay the blame onto me
Lay the blame
Lay the blame onto me
'Cause we all falter
We all falter
'Cause we all falter
'Cause we all falter
'Cause we all falterEmbed
