Tired of Me LyricsI'm so tired of me
Withered and unclean
I'm too blind to see
Shit that is me
You're so tired of me
I'm too blind to see
You don't need me
My abnormality
I'm so tired of me
Withered and unclean
I'm too blind to see
Shit that is me
I'm so tired of me
Withered and unclean
I'm too blind to see
Shit that is meEmbed
