Oh 14, oh 14, take me all through the night
Oh 14, oh 14, take me all through the night
Oh 14, oh 14, take me all through the night
Oh 14, oh 14, take me all through the night

Oh 14, oh 14, take me home
Oh 14, oh 14, take me home
Oh 14, oh 14, take me home
Oh 14, oh 14, take me home


Oh 14, oh 14, take me all through the night

I've got a brand new song
I've got a brand new song
It's gonna be a number one
It's gonna be a number one
Hit it!

And I'd love to show the world
I'd love to show the world
I'd love to show the world my new song
It keeps me up all night long
Yeah!

I've got a brand new car
I've got a brand new car
I hope I'm gonna go far
In my brand new car
Yeah, brand new car, yeah

And I'd love to show the world
I'd love to show the world
I'd love to show the world my new car
Well I'm going, going, I'm going, yeah!

I've got a brand new song
It's two minutes fifty one
Radio friendly, radio friendly, radio friendly
Radio, radio, radio, radio, yeah!

And I'd love to show the world
I'd love to show the world
I'd love to show the world my new song
It keeps me up all night long
Yeah!Embed
