Last of the Summer Wine Lyrics:
Well, love isn't easy
That's just the way it goes
Well, I'm loving the high road
I'll never ride alone again!
I'm searching for something
Something I love!
We'll be searching, going, right over we go
I'm going again!
:
Over and over and over again
Under and under and under again
Over and over and over again
I'm going again!
:
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Going, I'm going
I'm going again!
:
Oh my days, fade all the way
Fade, oh my days
Fade all the way!
We're going up!
We're growing up!1Embed
