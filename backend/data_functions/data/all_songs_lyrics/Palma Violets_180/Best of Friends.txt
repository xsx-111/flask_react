Best of Friends Lyrics
I see Alaina in the distance
Shouting out a word
And she runs through persistence
Oh, her mind is so absurd
Oh love, oh love
Jumping jolly until the end
I wanna be your friend

I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my girl
I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my…
I don't want you to be my…

Well well well…
I see witness Wendy
Her short hair and her pistol boots
Oh man, she's always ready
To take that line and finally shoot
Oh lord, oh lord
Jumping jolly until the end
I wanna be your friend
I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my girl
I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my…
I don't want you to be my…
I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my girl
I wanna be your best friend
I don't want you to be my…
I don't want you to be my…5Embed
