Step Up for the Cool Cats Lyrics
You drive my car
Around the bend
It never end
It never ends
Oh you
Yeah you
You're on the bend
But I gotta admit
You're on the end
Just step it up
Oh you
Yeah you

All the cool cats said you must lie on

You're on the bend
But I'm still here
You're on the road
Better run, boy run
Better run, boy run
Better run, boy run

You had me dancing in the sun
You got me dancing in the sun
You got me dancing in the sunEmbed
