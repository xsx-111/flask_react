Chicken Dippers Lyrics
Take me down
Take me go
But I'll go
Away again
Your head, your head's on me
Your head is a stone red cage

And you make me feel like I'm the only one
You make me feel like I'm the only one
(I'm the only)

I'm running, I'm running around you
I'm running, I'm running around
Your hair, your hair's on me
Your head is a stone red cage

And you make me feel like I'm the only one
You make me feel like I'm the only one
You make me feel like I'm the only one
(I'm the only)

You make me feel like I'm the only one
I'm the onlyEmbed
