All the Garden Birds Lyrics
Don't shoot me down
Don't shoot me a down
All the garden birds
All you need is love
Don't shoot me down
Don't shoot me a down
All the garden birds
All you need is love

And i don't think I can have
To get back
I don't think I can have
To get back
I don't think I can have
To get back
I don't think I can have

All my friends were there and all of the garden
All my friends were there and all of the garden
All my friends were there and all of the garden
All my friends were there and all of the garden
All my friends were there and all of the gardenEmbed
