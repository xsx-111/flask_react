We Found Love Lyrics
Laughing all the way to the cell
And I've been paid off
Stepping out into the sun
Cause I'm not done

I'm going to find myself a ladyfriend
And stick by her until the end
La la la la la Layla, cause I found love
Oh Lord!
I'm going to find myself a ladyfriend
And stick by her until the end
La la la la la Layla, cause I found love
Oh No!

You are my serpentine
But I'll never look you in the eyes again
You are my one divine
But I'll never look you in the eyes again1Embed
