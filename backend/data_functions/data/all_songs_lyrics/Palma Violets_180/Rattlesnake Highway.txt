Rattlesnake Highway Lyrics
Rattlesnake highway I wanna go
To the place that I'm home
Strummer on my shoulder (oh he knows)
Knows how it feels to be alone
Sow the seeds
And we can watch it grow
Just like trees
We excel in the Sun
Unlike you, I have nothing
Going on for me
Cause I love you
Sun Sun, come along

Rattlesnake!

Hold up, hold up
What's that you say?
Milo, why have you run away?
I guess you caught the morning news today
I'm a rattlesnake highway man!
I'm a rattlesnake highway!
I'm a rattlesnake highway!
I'm a rattlesnake highway, man!Embed
