Three Stars Lyrics
Look in the sky
Up towards the North
There are three stars
That are brightly shining forth
They're shining all so bright
From Heaven above
Gee, gonna miss you
Everybody sends their love

In Heaven there's love
In the backyard 
It comes towards
It's cleaning off the 
And they're shining all so high
From Heaven above
Gee, we're gonna miss you
Everybody sends their...

When the night is falling in the summer love
Tell me where you gonna stay tonight
When the night is falling when you're around
Let's sing out 'cause we're  town
When the night is falling in the summer love
Then you help me out 'cause there's trouble aroundEmbed
