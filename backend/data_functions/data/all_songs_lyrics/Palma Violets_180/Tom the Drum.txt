Tom the Drum Lyrics
Hey love, I want to be alone
I want to talk to tom
He knows more than you do
And we're meant to get along
Hey you, I don't wanna come and play
You're on your role of today
I'd rather be with tom
He always seems alone

Oh tom, it's you my embrace
He always wins the race
Sitting now on this space
Bending out of space

Fucking brilliant

Tom, tom, tom
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to knowEmbed
