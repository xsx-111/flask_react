You Want It Back Lyrics
Gimme a lil bit more music in my headphones
African
Cool, young brother

Alright, alright, you keep talking that
We'll see
Right about now, JB's on the set
Bringin' you that, Propellerheads
That's what you want, head? (yeah)
Come on!

Sexy lover smokin' with passion
Step to the front if you wanna see the action
Glance at the mic should I rock my style
It's been a long time since I got buck wild
Sometimes I feel lost in the sauce
When it comes down to who's the boss
Am I being too soft
Feelin' for your love and your special attention
Trying to get you to look in my direction
Eh you 'bout straight, put a cake in your oven
Got to see me to get the good lovin'
Wanna get the chance to sex and romance ya
On the dance floor, yeah you want more
I'm wit your girlfriends on the weekend
I give you all types of freakin' now you tell me you're leavin'
Girl get a grip cause I'm hittin' all angles
You know how the game goes
You gon' feel shameful
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
(you don't want this)
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
(you want that)
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back

Spotlight game tight
Every night new sights
Who would ever think life could be so nice
Everything's love til you find out the price
You're saying you're sick of the same routine
Can't separate life from a floor style dream
You wanna take a look split from the scenes
When you thought you got a grip it's true you lost steam
Kick start strain but you can't find step
In your place is a stud with a bit more pep
Little less rep secret well kept
Aid her when you need every night you slept
Heard it all before can't believe it came true
Hard to see what a good party'll do
What ya gon' do listen to your crew
Shoulda took a better look at who's sleeping with you
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back

Sexy lover smokin' with passion
(Na-na-na-na-na)

Everytime I turn around you're lookin' for somethin' new
Talkin' 'bout who got to find something else to do
Who you wit' and what you want is just a fantasy
That's why I keep tellin' you your ass need to be with me

You know what I'm sayin'
That's what you want...
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
When you had it, you didn't want it
Now you ain't got it, so you want it back
Sexy lover smokin' with passion
(Na-na-na-na-na)Embed
