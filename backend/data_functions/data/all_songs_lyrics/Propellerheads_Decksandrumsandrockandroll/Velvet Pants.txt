Velvet Pants Lyrics
"What's different, Pete, about the '69 that makes it so exciting to you?"
"Two-thousand people in a seething, roaring, shouting mass"
All the people I know are - musicians
I revolve around music
That's all I know
They each got their own little thing that they like
We hustled our way in, everybody had long hair
We hustled our way in, everybody had long hair
We hustled our way in, everybody had long hair
We hustled our way in, everybody had long hair
It's groovy
It's groovy, I guess
It's groovy
It's groovy, I guess
Man, it's groovy
It's groovy
It's groovy
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's wearing velvet pants
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
He's wearing velvet pants
He's wearing velvet pants
I'm having too much fun, I realized it last night
Send the first kid down, send the first kid down
And they played records
Send the first kid down, send the first kid down
And they played records
And they played records
Send the first kid down, send the first kid down
Send the first kid down, send the first kid down
Send the first kid down, send the first kid down
Send the first kid down, send the first kid down
Send the first kid down, send the first kid down
Send the first kid down, send the first kid down
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's got a nice body, he's wearing velvet pants
He's wearing velvet pants (That's all she talks about)
He's wearing velvet pants (That's all she talks about)
He's wearing velvet pants (That's all she talks about)
He's wearing velvet pants (That's all she talks about)
He's wearing velvet pants (That's all she talks about)
He's wearing velvet pants (That's all she talks about)
He's wearing velvet pants
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
That's all she talks about (He's wearing velvet pants, he's wearing velvet pants)
It's groovy
It's groovy, I guess (He's wearing velvet pants)
It's groovy
It's groovy, I guess (He's wearing velvet pants)
It's groovy
It's groovy, I guess (He's wearing velvet pants)
It's groovy
It's groovy, I guess (He's wearing velvet pants)
It's groovy
It's groovy, I guessEmbed
