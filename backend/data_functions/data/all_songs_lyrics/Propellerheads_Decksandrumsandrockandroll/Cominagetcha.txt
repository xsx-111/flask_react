Cominagetcha LyricsAs a matter-of-fact I swallowed one of these about two hours ago
And the explanation is that it is, in fact, my hand
Everything, it seemed, was alright
And that is a record
Get out of that groove and you've had it
Amazing
The track is a groove
You know, it really is amazing
Judging it just right through the groove
You know, it really is amazing
Ah, yes, but what if you get out of that groove?
Oh, well, then I'm in troubleEmbed
