Bang On! Lyrics
Banks and banks of humming machinery
I've never seen so many knobs
We're going to have to do something Charlie
Try pushing that button there
No, how about that one
No, not that one either
I know, I'll try pushing this one
Hold my hat, would you?
There's a good fella
That's the one
That's the one
Bang on
Bang on
Bang onEmbed
