Good Help (Is So Hard to Find) Lyrics
You'll never have to hear the word "no"
If you keep all your friends on the payroll
The non-disclosure pages signed
Your secrets safe between those lines

The scaffolding will cheer and console you
But remember what your mother told you
That good help is so hard to find
For people who are so refined

You're trying to turn into the skid
In this never-ending grid

There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
"Only a fool gives it away"
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives it away

You said you wanna stake out your claim
High above the city from where you came
Don't you know the air's so thin?
It starves the brain of oxygen
I know it's such a dangerous place
For there are more ascensions than there is space
Angels causing accidents
The camera phones'll document

But if I start to levitate
Pull me down with all your weight

There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
"Only a fool gives it away"
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives it away


You're trying to turn into the skid
In this never-ending grid
But you should know it's not ideal
All those hands upon the wheel
There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
"Only a fool gives it away"
There's a long, slow fade
To a darkened stage
And I hear you say
"Only a fool gives it away"
Only a fool would give
Only a fool would give
Only a fool gives this away3Embed
