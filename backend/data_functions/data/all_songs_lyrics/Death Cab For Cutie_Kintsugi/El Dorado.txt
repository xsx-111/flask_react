El Dorado Lyrics
Seems you finally found, finally found El Dorado
Over in Culver City, shining bright, name in lights
And I tried to be hyped for you
Oh I'm trying to be hyped for you

It's kinda like a party that you never wanted to attend
But when an invitation finally arrives you change your mind
And I tried to be hyped for you
Oh I'm trying to be hyped for you
As you slip away behind the gates
Behind the gates


Seems you finally found, finally found El Dorado
So why does it feel underwhelming, barely real?
And I tried to be hyped for you
Oh I'm trying to be hyped for you
As you slip away behind the gates
Behind the gates

El Dorado
El Dorado
El Dorado
