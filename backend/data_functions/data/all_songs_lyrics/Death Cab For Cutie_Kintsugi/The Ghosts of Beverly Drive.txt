The Ghosts of Beverly Drive Lyrics
If only you had known me before the accident
For with that grand collision, came a grave consequence
Receptors overloaded; they burst and disconnect
Til there was little feeling, please work with what is left

Oh, I need not be flattered, that you've never been here before
So there’s no need to mention, that you've no firsts anymore
But if you let me be your skyline, I’ll let you be the wave
That reduces me to rubble, but looked safe from far away

I don’t know why, I don’t know why I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I expect to find
Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

You wanna teach but not be taught
And I wanna sell but not be bought
So let us not be lonesome
So let us not be lonesome
Lost in between our needs and wants
Our needs and wants
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I return to the scenes of these crimes
Where the hedgerows slowly wind, through the ghosts of Beverly Drive
I don’t know why, I don’t know why, I don’t know what I expect to find
Where all the news is secondhand, and everything just goes on as planned

I don’t know why, I don’t know why
I don’t know why, I don’t know why
I don’t know why, I don’t know why
I don’t know why, I don’t know whyEmbed
