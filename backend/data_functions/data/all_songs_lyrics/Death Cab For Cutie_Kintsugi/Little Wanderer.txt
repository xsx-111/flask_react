Little Wanderer Lyrics:
You sent a photo out your window of Tokyo
Told me you were doing fine
You said the cherry blossoms were blooming
And that I was on your mind
But I couldn’t make you out through the glitches
It’s how it always seems to go
So we say our goodbyes over messenger
As the network overloads
When the network overloads
:
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Off across the sea
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Won’t you wander back to me
Back to me

Always fall asleep when you’re waking
I count the hours on my hands
Doing the math to the time zone you’re at
Is an unseen part of the plan
But if you’ll be my bluebird returning
Then I’ll be your evergreen
Standing tall on your horizon
Guiding you home to me
Guiding you home to me
:
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Off across the sea
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Won’t you wander back to me
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
How I wish that you could see
Little wanderer, little wanderer
How I need you back with me
Back with me
:
You sent a photo out your window of Paris
Of what you wish that I could see
But someone’s gotta be the lighthouse
And that someone’s gotta be me
And I hope your absence makes us grow fonder
I hope we always feel the same
When our eyes meet past security, we embrace in the baggage claim
When we kiss in the baggage claim
:
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Off across the sea
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
Won’t you wander back to me
You’re my wanderer, little wanderer
How I wish that you could see
Little wanderer, little wanderer
How I need you back with me
Back with me7Embed
