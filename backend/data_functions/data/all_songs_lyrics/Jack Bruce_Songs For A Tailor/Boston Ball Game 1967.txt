Boston Ball Game 1967 LyricsHey, when the time comes
Will you, won't you
Keep your head in the games
Of the sunshine?
Well that time has come
And you can't do what you want
Now your mind  is not looking
Well hello there baby
If you hate it, hate it so much
Why not leave it, maybe try like me too?
We who were your fathers
Have shared out all tomorrow's sunshine
Time is passing baby
If you let it it will make you
Do what they want
Maybe be like them too
Those who were our fathers
Peer from inside their towers lookingEmbed
