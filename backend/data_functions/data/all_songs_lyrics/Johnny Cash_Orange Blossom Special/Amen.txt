Amen LyricsAmen, amen, amen amen amen
Little baby, in the manger, King Jesus
At the temple, there they found him, teaching the elders
Poor Lazarus, didn't bear it, up a walking
Yeah, amen, amen, amen, amen amen amen
Lord Jesus, up in heaven, who'll be returning
Shout it children, let me hear you, hallelujah
Sing it children, sing amen, amen, one more timeEmbed
