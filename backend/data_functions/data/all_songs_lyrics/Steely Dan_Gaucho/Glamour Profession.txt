Glamour Profession Lyrics
6:05, outside the stadium
Special delivery for Hoops McCann
Brut and charisma
Poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good
He's a crowd pleasing man

One on one
He's schoolyard Superman
Crashing the backboard
He's Jungle Jim, again
When it's all over
We'll make some calls from my car

We're a star
It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
All aboard the Carib Cannibal
Off to Barbados
Just for the ride
Jack with his radar
Stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel
With his Eurasian bride

On the town
We dress for action
Celluloid bikers
Is Friday's theme
I drove the Chrysler
Watched from the darkness
While they danced

I'm the one
It's a glamour profession
(I'm the one)
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys

Hollywood
I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools
That's my claim to fame

Jive Miguel
He's in from Bogota
Meet me at midnight
At Mr. Chow's
Szechuan dumplings
Now that the deal has been done

I'm the one
It's a glamour profession
(I'm the one)
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
