The Wreck of the Beautiful LyricsWhen the beautiful set sail back in 1970
She was state of the art, the flagship of our navy
But the salt sea took its toll and the rust began to show
And with a heavy heart we took her to the breaker's yard
I thought I heard her call, maybe I heard nothing at all
I thought I heard her call from the wreck of the beautiful
But like the fattened cow can smell the butcher's knife
She knew where she was bound, a sad end to a proud life
That's when I heard her cry and the waves rose five miles high
And the men who did not drown watched as the beautiful went down
I thought I heard her call, maybe I heard nothing at all
I thought I heard her call from the wreck of the beautifulEmbed
