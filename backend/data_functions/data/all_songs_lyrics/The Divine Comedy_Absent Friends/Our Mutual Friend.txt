Our Mutual Friend LyricsNo matter how I try, I just can't get her out of my mind
And when I sleep I visualize her
I saw her in the pub
I met her later at the night-club;
A mutual friend introduced us
We talked about the noise
And how it's hard to hear your own voice
Above the beat and the sub-bass;
We talked and talked for hours
We talked in the back of our friend's car
As we all went back to his place
On our friend's settee
She told me that she really liked me
And I said 'Cool. The feeling's mutual.'
We played old 45's
I said 'It's like the soundtrack to our lives.'
And she said 'True, it's not unusual.'
Then privately we danced
But couldn't seem to keep our balance;
A drunken haze had come upon us
We sank down to the floor and we sang
A song that I can't sing any more
And then we kissed and fell unconscious
I woke up the next day, all alone, but for a headache;
I stumbled out to find the bathroom
But all I found was her, wrapped around another lover;
No longer then is he our mutual friendEmbed
