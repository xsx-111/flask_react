All Things LyricsAll things big and beautiful
All creatures cute and small
All things weird and wonderful
Celebrate them all
The creatures of the land
From country field to desert sand:
Hippopotamus, mole, vole, giraffe, boa constrictor, bunny rabbit, cockroach, man, monkey, wolf, scorpion
The creatures of the air
The things that fly around up there:
Dragonfly, magpie, duck, parrot, sparrow, sparrow hawk, albatross, wasp, bee, bat, flamingo, mosquito, crow
All things big and beautiful
All creatures cute and small
All things weird and wonderful
Celebrate them all
The creatures of the sea
From mountain stream to ocean deep:
Octopus, seahorse, jelly-fish, tuna-fish, star-fish, plankton, cod, manta ray, rainbow trout, hammerhead shark
The creatures of the snow
The things that like it nice and cold:
Penguin, polar bear, husky, reindeer, yak, arctic fox, Siberian tiger, walrus, seal
These things were all born free
They weren’t put there for you or me
To do with as we please
And how far will we go
Before we lose our way back home?
Well, I don’t know
All things big and beautiful
All creatures cute and small
All things weird and wonderful
Celebrate them all
Celebrate them all
Celebrate them all
Celebrate them all
Well, celebrate them all
