Girl Least Likely LyricsWell, I knew this girl
In secondary school
All of her teachers
Assumed she was a fool
Because they never heard
A single word from
Alison Green
Girl least likely to succeed
Alison Green
Girl least likely to succeed
Alison Green
Girl least likely to succeed
Alison Green
Where you been all this time?
Well, I asked her once
Why she never spoke
And with a furtive glance
She whispered: “I don’t know
Maybe it’s because
Just because I’m
Alison Green”
Girl least likely to succeed
Alison Green
Girl least likely to succeed
Alison Green
Girl least likely to succeed
Alison Green
Where you been all this time?
Sometimes I think about those days
I wonder what became of my old friends
Of my old enemies
All the hopes and dreams
Were they realised?
Or were they simply given up on?
Like Alison
Well, I read somewhere
She’d started a website
And when she sold the shares
She found that overnight
She’d become a millionaire
Congratulations
Alison Green!
Girl least likely to succeed

Girl least likely to succeed
