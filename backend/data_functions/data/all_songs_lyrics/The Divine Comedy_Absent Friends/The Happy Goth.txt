The Happy Goth LyricsThe lonely road
You choose to travel on
It must seem awfully long
Innocence all gone
It must be wrong to
Hide your lovely face away
That music you play
I'm not saying it's bad, no, no
It just seems terribly sad
Is everything all right?
I'd like to think you'd
Tell me if something was wrong
Well, her clothes are blacker than the blackest cloth
And her face is whiter than the snows of Hoth
She wears Dr. Martens and a heavy cross
But on the inside she's a happy goth
"Don't worry mum, don't worry dad
The hours that I spend alone
Are the happiest I've ever had"
That's what she'd say
If she ever spoke to you
But it's something she can never do
Cause it's only by herself
That she'll find out
What makes her different from the rest
Well, her clothes are blacker than the blackest cloth
And her face is whiter than the snows of Hoth
She wears Dr. Martens and a heavy cross
But on the inside she's a happy goth
Well, her clothes are blacker than the blackest cloth
And her face is whiter than the snows of Hoth
She wears Dr. Martens and a heavy cross
But on the insideEmbed
