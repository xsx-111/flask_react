Come Home Billy Bird Lyrics
William wakes with his clothes on
The morning call has been and gone
And he might not make the flight but he will try
Bit by bit it comes back to him
A bunch of Belgian business men
And a strange drinking game, oh God why?

Come home Billy Bird
International business traveller
Come home Billy Bird

He hails a cab but the driver sucks
He drives so slowly and he talks so much
That it hurts Billy Bird's aching brain
He runs from the cab to the check-in desk
She says "no way", but William begs on his knees
"Please, please, please". "Well okay"

Come home Billy Bird
International business traveller
Come home Billy Bird
Drenched in sweat he finds his seat
And with the luggage squeezed down beneath his feet
He begins to think that things can't get no worse
But then a voice says, "bags that can't be stowed
In the overhead locker must go below in the hold
Please let go, thank you sir."

Come home Billy Bird
International business traveller
Come home Billy Bird

He runs on past the carousel
Screaming, "damn my luggage all to hell
I can buy a new shirt and tie any day."
He rides from the airport into town
To the high-school football ground
Where his son has just begun his big football game

Come home Billy Bird
International business traveller
Come home Billy BirdEmbed
