Sticks and Stones Lyrics
You and I go together
Like the molar and the drill
Flesh is weak but darling we know
That the ego's weaker still
I've been hung, drawn and quartered
Slowly slaughtered like a goat
By the tongue of a woman
Who just couldn't let it go

Sticks and stones may break my body
But words can tear me apart
So be careful when you tell me
Spare a thought for my heart

Broken bones fuse together
Bruises never last for long
But once they're said, words stay spoken
And hearts stay broken from that moment on

Sticks and stones may break my body
But words can tear me apart
So be careful when you tell me
Spare a thought for my heartEmbed
