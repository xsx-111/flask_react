Idaho LyricsIdaho, let me go
I feel so very far from home
You folks are kind
If a little crazy
Not unlike my own sweet lady
Well the hotel’s clean
Not too noisy
The trouble is
It’s in Boise, Idaho
Idaho, I suppose
You look quite pretty all swathed in snow
But just right now I’d rather be
Sitting on my sofa with a cup of tea
Watching Premiership football
The proper kind
Something that y’all
Just can’t find in Idaho
Idaho
Idaho, I’m down so low
I wanna pack my things and go
Find a flight, make a connection
It terrifies me but I’ll make an exception
Just to hold my child
And say, “Shh! What’s that noise?”
She, she wants her daddy
But he’s in Boise, Idaho
Idaho
Idaho, this I know
It’s ten times warmer in New Mexico
But may I say
It’s plain that you are
Ten times cooler than the state of Utah
Well, I miss my girl, but hey!
That’s my choice, see!
Without her this whole world is Boise, Idaho
