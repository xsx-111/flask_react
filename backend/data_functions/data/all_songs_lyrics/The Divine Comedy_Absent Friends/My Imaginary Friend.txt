My Imaginary Friend LyricsWould you like to meet my little friend?
Don't try to shake his hand, he's just pretend
His name is Benjamin, that's his name
My mama says, "You're insane
Boy, you really are the end
You and your imaginary friend"
Daddy drives the mobile library
He works peripatetically, that's right
He doesn't get much time to play with us
So we just read and make up stuff
And it drives him round the bend
Me and my imaginary friend
M Y I M A G I N A R Y F R I E N D
One day we're gonna play hide and seek
And Ben will be up the creek
Never to be seen again
He'll disappear the day that childhood ends
And reality descends
I'll never forget you my imaginary friendEmbed
