Charmed Life LyricsWhen I hold you in my arms
And look back on my charmed life, my charmed life
I hope, I hope if nothing more
That one day you'll call your life a charmed life
Well I've never really worried that much
About making lots of money and such
And I always seem to land upon my feet
And though there's been some difficult times
The good times were never far behind
I've snatched all of my victories from the jaws of defeat
When I hold you in my arms
And look back on my charmed life, my charmed life
I hope, baby I hope if nothing more
That one day you'll call your life a charmed life
Well the course of true love never ran smooth
They broke my heart and I broke theirs too
And breaking up is so very hard to do
But I knew I'd find the one
And sure enough she came along
And not long after that along came you
Well sometimes this life is like being afloat
On a raging sea in a little row-boat
Just trying not to be washed overboard
But if you take your chances and you ride your luck
And you never, never, never, never, never give up
Those waves will see you safely to a friendly shore
When I hold you in my arms
I know that this is a charmed life
A charmed lifeEmbed
