Leaving Today LyricsSo suddenly awake
No light from yonder window breaks
No crowing cock
Just my old clock, please make it stop
I try to wrestle free
But like the dew she clings to me
"No way Jose, you dont get away that easily"
Leaving today, leaving today, leaving today
"Release me let me go
I love you more than you could know
All I can do is promise to come home to you."
I tip-toe from the bed
And put my head around the nursery door
To say goodbye
It breaks my heart every single time
I'm leaving today, I'm leaving today
I'm leaving today
I would stay if you asked me
So for God's sake dont ask me to stay
My taxi has arrived
Goodbye sweet simple life, goodbye
The city's waking up
Dreams fizzle out like raindrops
Racing down the glass
They blur the street lamps as we passEmbed
