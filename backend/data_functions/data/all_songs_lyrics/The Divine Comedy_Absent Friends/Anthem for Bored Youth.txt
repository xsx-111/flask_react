Anthem for Bored Youth Lyrics“Knowledge is a curse
But ignorance is worse”
I’ve heard it said
Quote yourself if no one else will
I am not prepared
To stick my head above that parapet no more
I’d rather be ignored
I could write a biting satire or a farcical spoof
But what would be the use?
I could write a thousand verses of beautiful truth
But what would be the use?
It’s just another anthem for bored youth
Have I writer’s block?
Or have I just forgotten who I am?
Am I who I was when I began?
Here’s a little game:
How many times do I say ‘I’ in this song?
It’s unlucky for some
I could write a biting satire or a farcical spoof
But what would be the use?
I could write a thousand verses of beautiful truth
But what would be the use?
It’s just another anthem for bored youthEmbed
