Love is a Beautiful Thing Lyrics(What you know about love?)
I know love is out of sight
(What you know about life?)
I think life can be so nice
If I find somebody
What you think will happen to me?
You'll find that
Love is a beautiful thing (so beautiful)
It'll teach her heart to sing (so beautiful)
It's the kind of thing that makes you crazy (so beautiful)
Makes you wanna swing
(How can you tell you got it?)
You feel it right in your heart
(When should I get on?)
It's never too soon to start
And I've gotta find somebody
To prove what you're telling me
You'll see that love is a beautiful thing (so beautiful)
It can teach your heart to sing (so beautiful)
It's the kind of thing that makes you crazy (so beautiful)
Make you wanna swing
Go get it now!
Meanwhile (hey)
(What you think about that?)
Well, I think it's kinda nice
(Love is really out of sight)
I'm glad I took your advice
'Cause I went and got somebody
To prove what you said was true
Now I know that love is a beautiful thing (so beautiful)
It can teach your heart to sing (so beautiful)
It's the kind of thing that makes you crazy (so beautiful)
Makes you wanna swing
Love is a beautiful thing (ain't it groovy) (so beautiful)
Love is a beautiful thing (so beautiful)Embed
