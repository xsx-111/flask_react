In the Midnight Hour Lyrics
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour
When there's nobody else around
Gonna take you girl and hold you
And do all the things I told you
In the midnight hour

Now I'm gonna hold you in my arms
And see that twinkle in your eyes
I'm gonna wait, wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love begins to shine
You're the only girl that I love
Yeah and I love you so
In the midnight hour
(Hey, hey, hey) Won't you listen to me (Hey)


I'm gonna wait 'til the midnight hour, baby
That's when my love comes tumbling down
Got to wait 'til the midnight hour, my love
When there's nobody else around but you and I
Just you and I
I'm gonna hold you in my arms in the midnight hour
In the midnight hour
Having nobody around us, nobody'll bother us
No trouble from anywhere, just you and I
Let's, uh, bring it down
Got to wait 'til the midnight hour
That's when my love comes tumbling down
Gonna wait, wait 'til the midnight hour, baby
When there's nobody, nobody around, just you and I
Nobody around but you and I, baby
And I'm gonna hold you,  hold you,  hold you,  hold you
Squeeze ya, tease ya, I need ya, love ya
Baby, ah, ah, right there, right there
Take it home nowEmbed
