Be My Baby Lyrics
Yeah, baby
Ooh, babe

If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy

If you know how to treat me, you know how to touch me
Baby, then you'll get the chance, the chance to love me
It's obvious, I want to be into you
But it all depends on all the things you do
'Cause babe, I promise, I promise
If you keep it real with me, be honest, be honest
You can get anything you want, that you want, babe
Just show me everything I need to see
I'll give you anything, boy

If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me -
I'll give you all of my trust if you don't mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club
All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only girl you see
So if you treat me right just the way that I want you
Oh, baby boy, I promise that I'll be on you
Oh-oh, on you
Night to the morning

If you know how to be my lover
Maybe you can be my baby
Hold me close under the covers
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy

Hey
I'll give you all of my trust, if you don't mess this up
You ain't tryna get no other girls when you in the club
All you got is eyes for me
I'm the only one you see

If you know how to be my lover (Be my)
Maybe you can be my baby (By my side)
Hold me close under the covers (Hey)
Kiss me, boy, and drive me crazy (Crazy, baby, yeah)
Be my, be my, be my, be my, be my baby
Be my, be my, be my baby, and drive me crazy
Mmm-mmm, yeah, ayy, mmm55Embed
