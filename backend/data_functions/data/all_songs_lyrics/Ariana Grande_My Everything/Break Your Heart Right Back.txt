Break Your Heart Right Back Lyrics

I shoulda saw it coming
I shoulda saw the signs
But I wanted to believe you, trust you
You said you wouldn't lie
But baby, you were so good, so good
You had me going blind
You said he was your best friend
I’m guessing I wasn't your type, hey

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you're mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back (I'm coming)
Want you to cry me a river (Out)
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody (I'm coming)
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me
You said I was your best, would be your last
Now he’s gone, you’re alone
Don’t want you back
You’re telling me you’re sorry
Well sorry, I'm over it
'Cause I've already been there done that
Not doing this again, no

What goes around comes around
And if it goes up, it comes down
I know you mad cause I found out
Want you to feel what I feel right now

Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back (I'm coming)
Want you to cry me a river (Out)
I just want to break your heart right back
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody (I'm coming)
My baby loves me (My baby loves me)
My baby loves me (My baby loves me)
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me (Ooh, yeah)
My baby loves me (Oh, woah)
My baby loves me (Oh, woah)
My baby, my baby (Yeah)
My baby loves me (Yeah)
Uh, listen, you got a man, but your man ain't loyal
Don’t understand how to spell it out for ya
Yes, I'm a G, from the A, and they ask why (Yeah?)
Sorry, had to tell you I'm a nice guy
Naw, I'm a sick guy, money too much
I step on stage, and girls move too much
The flow so gross, my nickname school lunch
And he with them other guys, and you know it's true 'cause
Okay, G-A-M-B-I-N-O
I know they hate, but I don’t know why, uh
I know the way he did you was whack
But I know how you can get dude right back and get with me

Now that it’s over
I just wanna break your heart right back, right back (I just wanna break your heart right back, right back, baby)
Want you to cry me a river (Want you to cry me a river)
I just want to break your heart right back (Right back)
Yeah, all this time I was blind, running 'round telling everybody
My baby loves me
(But do he really tho?)
My baby loves me
(But do he really tho?)
My baby, my baby
My baby loves me (My baby loves me)
My baby loves me
(But do he really tho?)
My baby loves me
(But do he really tho?)
My baby, my baby (Yeah, ask what?)
My baby loves me
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tellin' everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tellin' everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tellin' everybody
Ooh, yeah, running 'round town tellin' everybody
I'm coming out, yeah, yeah, say, say he’s coming, hey
I'm coming out58Embed
