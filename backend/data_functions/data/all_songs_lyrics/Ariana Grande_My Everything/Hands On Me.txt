Hands On Me Lyrics
Keep your hands on me, don't take them off
Until I say so, let me break you off
We'll be taking off or maybe making love
You just keep your eyes on my you know what

Trembling, when you touch
Rush is racing, body begging
Picture me and you making
Making sweet love, baby, give it to me

Eyes on me
Dance on me tonight, you're all, all I need
Keep your hands on me, oh boy (don’t take them off)

Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
(Don't take them off)
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P

Skirt off, keep the high heels on
I might be a little thing, but I like that long, yeah
Don’t let these eyes fool you
I can take it, hold nothing back, give it to me

Eyes on me (Hey)
Dance on me tonight, you're all, all I need
Keep your hands on me, oh boy (don’t take them off)

Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
(Don't take them off)
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P

Can I, can I, can I please put my hand on it?
Shaking like they're burning, lemme put a fan on it
Bumble bee, got the parachute to land on it
'Cause you got the cake, can I put my candle on it?
It's your birthday, every day with me
And I make her hand rocky A-S-A-P
Got me talking marriage, I like what I see
I'ma put a ring on it, word to Bey and Jay-Z
But before I do that, let me put a hand on it
Oh, so hot I could catch a tan on it
Got me sweating so much, we can swim on the dance floor
We gon' have to mess around and put a dam on it (dam on it)

I love the way it feels
Stay back and keep still
Your hands softly (softly)
Please don't take them off
Don’t take them off
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it (Ah, baby)
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it (Oh)
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it (Oh)
Put your hands on it, put your hands on it
(Don't take them off)
Put your hands on me
You can put your hands on me
If you like what you see
Baby, put your hands on me54Embed
