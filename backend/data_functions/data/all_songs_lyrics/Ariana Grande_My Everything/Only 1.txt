Only 1 Lyrics
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
I want you, I want you
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself
Let me introduce myself

Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's no one around
I know all the competition that's after you
So I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?

That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me, that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew

I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have to give is only mine
That's how I know

I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
Only one
Be your only one
