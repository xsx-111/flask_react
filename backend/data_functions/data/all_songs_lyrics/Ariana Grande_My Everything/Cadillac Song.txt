Cadillac Song Lyrics
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you

Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you, you, yeah
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent

Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby, that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you, you, yeah
Mmm, oh baby, oh babe16Embed
