Just a Little Bit of Your Heart Lyrics
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her

And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say
I know I'm not your only
But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you

Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Just a little bit, oh-oh, ooh, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

I know I'm not your only, but at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none

Oh, babe
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit, my baby)
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for85Embed
