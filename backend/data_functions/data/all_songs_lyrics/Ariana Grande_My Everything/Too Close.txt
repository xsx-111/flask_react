Too Close Lyrics
I want you (Oh)
I want you (Oh)

You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy, you got my mind playing truth or dare
Daring me kiss you right here

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show
I-woah-woah-woah

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great
So, what would you do?
What would you say if I said I loved you that way?

But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show, oh

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close

All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
All my ladies, all my ladies
All my ladies, make noise
But I just can't let it show, oh

I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Oh, I want you, oh, I want you, oh, I want you19Embed
