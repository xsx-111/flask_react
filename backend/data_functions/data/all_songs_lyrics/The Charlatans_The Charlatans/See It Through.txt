See It Through LyricsCarry me away from the country
Ride a number 24 to the west
Feel the earth begin to move on the music
Singin' anthems iI'll be down anywheres
I wanna free all the monkeys
Don't wanna live in the zoo
Its gettin' better, one day its gonna happen
And we'll see it through
Back upon the hillside our love smiles
And I see you won a cheap holiday
And I feel I find it hard to deny it
I'll be there, I'll be there
I wanna free all the monkeys
Don't wanna live in the zoo
Its gettin' better, one day its gonna happen
And we'll see it through
Get us through
See us through
Right now baby the night's gonna change me and you
I wanna be with this country
I can't, I've seen all there is
Its getting better, one day' its gonna happen
And we'll see it through
Get us through
Get us through
Right now baby the world won't ever change me and youEmbed
