Bullet Comes LyricsSometimes you cry
Cry sometimes
What you gonna do when the bullet comes round?
What gonna do when the seas are down?
Lickin' like a lion
With a big cat heart
Checkin' in the dark
Bein' quick bein' smart
Live it like you love it
Do it lets go
Blowin' with the giant
Saying ge fi fo
Stuck on the way you walk
Hooked on the way you talk
Stuck on the way you walk
Hooked on the way you talk
Tell me its the way you feel
And not the place you hold your dreams, baby
It's not where you are
Tell me its the way you feel
And not the place you hold your dreams, baby
It's not where you are
One day we'll fly
Fly from the wack o' ma mind
Hope you're here to stay to see the bullets come round
People 'working out' with their sun hats on
Kiss me like a tiger
With a big cat heart
I'll read it if you buy it
Feelin' quick bein' smart
Lookin' at the devil
Poking man's stone
Blowin' with the giant
Saying ge fi fo
Stuck on the way you walk
Hooked on the way you talk
Stuck on the way you walk
Hooked on the way you talk
Tell me it's the way you feel
Not the place you hold your dreams, baby
It's not where you are
Tell me it's the way you feel
Not the place you hold your dreams, baby
It's not where you are
Live it like you love it
Live it like you love it
Live it like you love it
Live it like you love it
Live it like you love itEmbed
