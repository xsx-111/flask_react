Tell Everyone Lyrics(This one's for her)
Tell everyone
Don't put it on
It makes no difference to me
Won't mess around
Been there too long
It makes no difference when you smile
Cos I don't run from love from anyone
And I could land on money or the moon
On hillside straights
Can't walk it's late
I know there's something left alive
No, I don't take no shit from anyone
And I could land on money or the moon
You know the sun will come soon
And we can sail away
Tell everyone
Don't put it on
It makes no difference to me
Cos I don't run from love from anyone
And I could land on money or the moon
You know the sun will come soon
And you can see you're there for meEmbed
