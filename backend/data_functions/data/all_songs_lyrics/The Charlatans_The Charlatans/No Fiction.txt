No Fiction LyricsOne thing on my mind
I think I'll take a little walk in the wild
The feelings come and roll
Put it in your pocket and I'll save it for another day
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Life becomes my shield
And she becomes my life
Not afraid of too much livin'
I'm waitin' for the day I see live it, wanna live it with a kiss
One hundred planes with bombs
Couldn't turn your headlights on
No fiction roping you down
You know and feel what's going on
There's a sad man on my mind
I think I'll take a little walk outside
But the feelings never go
You can tell me, you can tell me wanna live it
I wanna live it how I seeEmbed
