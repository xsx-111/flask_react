Here Comes a Soul Saver LyricsHere comes a soul saver
On your record player
Floatin' about in the dust
You sing the joys, baby
I'll be down when you leave
When you're free from your rust
Take your pick
Who's your saviour?
Come in five different flavours
Tell me I'm sweeter
Than your broken leader
I'll take the smooth with the rough
I see you lyin' there
Put it down
No reply in the sand, in the mud
Don't kick it, I wanna keep it
Don't feel it, I wanna drive
In the sunshine of your life
In the sunshine of your life
Can you feel it when it's right?
Can you feel it in your soul
Can you feel what's goin' on?
Yeah, you're right
Don't kick it, I wanna freeze it
Don't feel it, I wanna drive
It's the sunshine of your life
It's the sunshine of your life
Can you feel it when it's right?
Look it comes an' when it flows
Like your country, country song
What's goin' on?
Goin' on
Goin' onEmbed
