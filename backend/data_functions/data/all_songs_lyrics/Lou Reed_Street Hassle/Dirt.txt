Dirt Lyrics
It's been a long time since I've spoken to you
Was it the right time?
Your current troubles, and you know, they'll get much worse
I hope you know how much I enjoyed them
You're a pig of a person, there's a justice in this world
Hey, how about that
Your lack of conscience and your lack of morality
Well, more and more people know all about it

Do you remember that song by a dude named Bobby Fuller?
It went like this:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

We sat around the other night, me and the guys
Trying to find the right word
That would best fit and describe
You people like that
That no principle has touched, no principle's baptized
How about that?
They'd eat shit and say it tasted good
If there was some money in it for them
Hey, you remember that song about this guy from Texas?
His name was Bobby Fuller
I'll sing it for you, it went like this:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

You're just dirt
You're just dirt
The only word for you is dirt
That's the only word that hurt, you're just dirt
That's all you're worth - cheap, cheap dirt
You know they call it cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
You're just cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
You're just dirt - nothing but - cheap uptown dirt
That's all you're worth - It's just - cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
That's all you're worth now (Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
You're just dirt (Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)Embed
