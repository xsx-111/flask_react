Shooting Star Lyrics
All the people had their share of the glory
Looking out after you
It's just a story about winners and glory
And you know that it's true

Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star

Some men may glory from a different condition of another car
And later persuasion would permit the arranging of a melting bar
And to cause more confusion, and to make this illusion would have gone too far
And it's my ambition of connected ignition of a Cadillac metal car

Ah ha, oh yeah, it's just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
You're just a shooting starEmbed
