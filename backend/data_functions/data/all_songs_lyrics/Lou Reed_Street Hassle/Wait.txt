Wait Lyrics
(Disgrace) Wait
I know I shouldn't, but we'll wait (Such a pretty face)
I know the time is getting late (Your name is such a waste)
And here is what you hesitate (Of such a pretty face)
But still I really wish that you'd wait (Your name is such a waste)
Although the passion might abate (Of such a pretty face)
And find you in another state (And it was such a disgrace)
That will seem just as a mistake (It was such a waste)
Oh baby, I really think that I oughta wait (Of such a pretty face)

(It was such a waste) Wait
I really wouldn't want your hate (Of such a pretty face)
Certainly not after like late (And it was such a waste)
You wanna give not only take (Of such a pretty face)
I know propriety is such a waste (It was such a disgrace)
But then it says you really have to wait (Such a pretty face)
Considering the present state (And it was such a waste)
Don't change my mind at this late date ( it was such a waste)
Oh baby, don't you think you oughta wait (Of such a pretty face)

Wait
Oh, now baby, how I wish you'd wait
I really wish you'd hesitate
Oh, baby, baby please why don't you wait
Oh, how I really wish that you would wait
Oh, how I wish you'd hesitate
But better late than never, now wait
Baby how I wish that you'd wait
Don't  my mind, now here's the date
I really wouldn't want you to hate
Then someone who would think I"m your date
I really really wish that you would wait
Oh baby baby then you'd waitEmbed
