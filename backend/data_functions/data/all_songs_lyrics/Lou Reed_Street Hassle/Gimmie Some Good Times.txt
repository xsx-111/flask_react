Gimmie Some Good Times Lyrics
Hey, if that ain't the rock'n'roll animal himself, what you doing bro?
(Standing on the corner)
Well, I can see that, what you got in your hand?
(Suitcase in my hand)
No, shit, what's this?
(Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest)
Fucking faggot junkie
(Jack, sweet Jane, I'm in a rock'n'roll band)
Well, I can see that

Some people say that you can't (No, no, no)
No matter how good you are
And some people say, they can't move (No, no, no)
No matter where they are

Gimme, gimme, gimme some good times
Gimme, gimme, gimme some pain
No matter ugly you are
You know to me it all looks the same

Rain from the morning in the blue clouds
Now just shining up with dew
Riding through the city in the big cars
And me, I ain't got nothing to do
Gimme, gimme, gimme some good times
Gimme, gimme, gimme some pain
Don't you know that things always look ugly
To me they always look the same

Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme some good times
Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme some pain
Don't you know that most things look ugly
To me they always look the same

Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know
To me they always look the same
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know
To me they always look the same
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know
To me they always look the same
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know
To me they always look the sameEmbed
