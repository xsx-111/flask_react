Mother of the World Lyrics

In and out and in and out again
In and out and in and out again

And where are you now
O Mother of the world?
Ah we feed from your hands
And we drink from your filth and your oil
So send them down
To scrape and suck the soil
Keep us safe inside
Your damp and rusty coil

In and out and in and out again
In and out and in and out again
Mother sun, mother of senseless things
Mother come, kill time as it begins5Embed
