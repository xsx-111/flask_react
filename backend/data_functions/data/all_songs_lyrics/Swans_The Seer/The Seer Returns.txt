The Seer Returns Lyrics
Behind the veil of silver scars
There is a special inverted star
He's a greasy beast
Heaving in a field of sticky black mud
I'm down here naked
There's a hole in my chest
Both my arms are broken
Pointing east and west

Your life pours into my mouth
My light pours out of my mouth
My life pours into your mouth
Your light pours into my mouth
Your life pours into my mouth
My light pours out of my mouth
My life pours into your mouth
Your life pours into my mouth

There's a jagged deep crack
In the crust of the earth
Spreading from north to south

Put your light in my mouth
Put your light in my mouth
Put your light in my mouth
Put your light in my mouth
Put your light in my mouth
Put your light in my mouth
Put your light in my mouth
Put your light in my mouth
Ahh, the mountains are crumbling
Ahh, the canyons are thundering
All the people are fucking
They're just a pile of writhing, selfish bliss
I know I'll never die
I scream up at the sky:
"You have arrived."

Hey
Bring the children home
Hey
Bring the children home
Hey
Bring the children home1Embed
