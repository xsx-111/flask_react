The Daughter Brings the Water Lyrics
In the screen
In the screen
The daughter in white water

In the screen
But not seen
Her hand describes the father

Stilted bones
Cloaked in foam
Squeeze laughter from the lather
Drink water from the daughter

Neither matter
Neither taste
Neither solid
Neither space
The daughter brings the water
The daughter brings clear waterEmbed
