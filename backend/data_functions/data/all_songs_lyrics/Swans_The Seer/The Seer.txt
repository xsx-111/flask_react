The Seer Lyrics
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all, I see it all, I see it all
I see it all, I see it all

I love you too much
I love you too much
I love you too much
I love you too much
Son, son
The common mind
The coal in my mouth
The coal in my mind
The common mind
