Red Sleeping Beauty LyricsI've been sound asleep for twenty years
If I'm sound asleep a hundred years
She won't wake me
She won't wake me
I've been sound asleep for twenty years
If I'm sound asleep a thousand years
He won't wake me
He won't wake me
Nothing stirs us, sound asleep, we're sound asleep
Nothing stirs us, sound asleep, we're sound asleep
While there's still a war to win
My red dream is everything
They won't wake me
They won't wake me
Nothing stops us, sound asleep, we're sound asleep
Nothing stops us, sound asleep, we're sound asleepEmbed
