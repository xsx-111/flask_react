Anorexic Rodin LyricsA beauty in the darkness of your eyes
Feel the beauty kept locked inside
You were the avatar, the conduit
The hardest thing you ever did
No, not here to be loved
Believed in the power and in your blood
No, not here to be loved
Believed in the power and in your blood
No, not here to be loved
Believed in the power and in your blood
No, not here to be loved
Believed in the power and in your blood
A perfect echoes of your youth
Like an anorexic Rodin
You re-enact the Tet Offensive
It's why you ended so defensive
A perfect echoes of your youth
Like an anorexic Rodin
You re-enact the Tet Offensive
It's why you ended so defensive
The endgame's slowly dissolving
The continuation of your planning
It's here to stay, it is here for good
But it's never gonna hide the truth
No, not here to be loved
Believed in the power and in your blood
No, not here to be loved
Believed in the power and in your blood
A perfect echoes of your youth
Like an anorexic Rodin
You re-enact the Tet Offensive
It's why you ended so defensive
A perfect echoes of your youth
Like an anorexic Rodin
You re-enact the Tet Offensive
It's why you ended so defensive
A beauty in the darkness of your eyes
Feel the beauty kept locked insideEmbed
