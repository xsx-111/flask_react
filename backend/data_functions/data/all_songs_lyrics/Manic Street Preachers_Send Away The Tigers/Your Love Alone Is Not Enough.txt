Your Love Alone Is Not Enough Lyrics
Your love alone
Is not enough, not enough, not enough
When times get tough
Oh, they get tough, they get tough, they get tough
Trade all your heroes
In for ghosts, in for ghosts, in for ghosts
They're always the ones that
Love you most, love you most, love you most
Your love alone
Is not enough, not enough, not enough
It's what you felt
It's what you said, what you said, what you said
You said the sky would
Fall on you, fall on you, fall on you
Through all the pain
Your eyes stayed blue, they stayed blue, baby blue

But your love alone won't save the world
You knew the secret of the universe
Despite it all you made it worse
It left you lonely
It left you cursed
You stole the sun
Straight from my heart, from my heart, from my heart
With no excuses
Just fell apart, fell apart, fell apart
No you won't make
A mess of me, mess of me, mess of me
For you're as blind as
A man can be, man can be, man can be

I could have seen for miles and miles
I could have made you feel alive
I could have placed us in exile
I could have written all your lines
I could have shown you how to cry
Your love alone is not enough
Your love alone is not enough

La la la la la la la la
I could have shown you
I show you how to cry
Your love alone is not enough
Your love aloneEmbed
