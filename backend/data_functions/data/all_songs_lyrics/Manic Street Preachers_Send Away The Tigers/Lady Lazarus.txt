Lady Lazarus LyricsSomewhere, on the other side of this wide night and the distance between us, I am thinking of you. The room is turning slowly away from the moon. This is pleasurable. Or shall I cross that out and say it is sad?
You say the feeling, it made you free
But now you've swapped sides with the enemy
To use the power that you have gained
Give it back and don't be ashamed
Keep those demons at bay, don't give up on forever
You can make it better
Lady Lazarus, you've risen and there's no way back
Lady Lazarus, you're stranded 'til the sky turns black
You say that you laugh so much that you cried
You said so much more than you denied
To use the power that you have gained
Give it back and don't be ashamed
Keep those demons at bay, don't give up on forever
You can make it better
Lady Lazarus, you've risen and there's no way back
Lady Lazarus, you're stranded 'til the sky turns black
You say that you laugh so much that you cried
You said so much more than you denied
To use the power that you have gained
Give it back and give up your fame
Keep those demons at bay, don't give up on forever
You can make it better
Lady Lazarus, you've risen and there's no way back
Lady Lazarus, you're stranded 'til the sky turns black
You said so much more than you denied
You secretly wished to be crucified
You said so much more than you denied
You secretly wished to be crucified
Crucified
