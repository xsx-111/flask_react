Fearless Punk Ballad LyricsAt 21 I thought this song was over
At 29 my eyes closed tight and suffered
Recurring dreams still unrelenting
The world turned west, we found redemption
At 26 something was delivered
No time to think and no time to worry
Wrote my words and they made more sense
They soon became, the best defence
And the rain came down, so, so hard
Like a fearless Punk ballad
And the rain came down, so, so hard
Like a fearless Punk ballad
At 17 it all came together
And the sky broke through with so much colour
We fell in love with one another
I guess we longed, to be discovered
And the rain came down, so, so hard
Like a fearless Punk ballad
And the rain came down, so, so hard
Like a fearless Punk ballad
And the rain came down, so, so hard
Like a fearless Punk ballad
And the rain came down, so, so hard
Like a fearless Punk balladEmbed
