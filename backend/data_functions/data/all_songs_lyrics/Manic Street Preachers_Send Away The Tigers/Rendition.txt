Rendition Lyrics
Rendition, rendition
Blame it on the coalition
Oh the air miles that I'm missing
Oh I wish we still had Jack Lemon
Rendition, rendition
I never knew the sky was a prison
It's a long hard revolution
Oh good god I feel like a liberal

For tomorrow I will beg, steal and borrow
Another moment of joy, pain and sorrow
I wish I knew what I did wrong
Can anybody hear the screaming of us?
The screaming of us in the long hard revolution

Rendition, rendition
Blame it on the coalition
The CIA will stay invisible
Oh good god I sound like a liberal
Rendition, rendition
I never knew the sky was a prison
It's a long hard revolution
Oh good god I feel like a liberal
