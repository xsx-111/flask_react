Little Girl Lost LyricsYou've been trying too hard
You've been reading too much and too fast
You've been lost for too long
You've been looking for hope so soon
Little girl lost
Hold you 'til there's no pain left
Little girl lost
Never knew how much you meant
I put the colour back in your eyes
I put the feeling back in your tired eyes
You've been avoiding the truth
But you will make your way back soon enough
Little girl lost
Hold you 'til there's no pain left
Little girl lost
Never knew how much you meant
You've been trying too hard
You've been reading too much and too fast
You've been lost for too long
You've been looking for hope so soon
Little girl lost
Hold you 'til there's no pain left
Little girl lost
Never knew how much you meantEmbed
