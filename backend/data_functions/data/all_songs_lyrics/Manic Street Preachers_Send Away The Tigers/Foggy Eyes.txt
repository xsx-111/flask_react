Foggy Eyes LyricsKeep your eyes shut and live your life
Someone else will pay the price
Open up your eyes and speak your mind
Leave your youth far behind
Foggy eyes, looking at their friends
Wondering what's to become of them
Think about the way it used to be
Foggy eyes, why can't you see?
I tried to tell them that it was OK
That you were gonna go away
You were like the people who were never real
Like the foggy eyes walking down the street
Foggy eyes, looking at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, going bang, bang, bang
Foggy eyes, looking at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, going bang, bang, bang
Foggy eyes, at home in a box of pain
Look in the mirror and travel far away
The world they see is enough to make you cry
Foggy eyes, saying goodbye to love
Foggy eyes, looking at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, going bang, bang, bang
Foggy eyes, looking at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, going bang, bang, bang
There's things we want each other to be
I'm sorry you think you're not important to me
I don't know why we make each other cry
Don't know why we all got foggy eyes
I think about all the things I never do
How I'm such a disappointment to you
'Cause I wanna play with you
I wanna get away from you
Foggy eyes, looking at foggy eyes
Foggy eyes, going bang, bang, bang
Foggy eyes, going bang, bang, bang, bangEmbed
