Welcome to the Dead Zone LyricsI feel so bad about myself
I feel so bad about everybody else
If I could only save the world from itself
Do something good, just for once
So bring on the night
Drive away the light
Bring the kiddies down and make it seem alright
So welcome to the dead zone
It's a circus full of whores
Get your body bought and sold
Blinded by the glitter and the gold
I'll be the guide and you'll be the sinner
A meeting of minds all coming together
I'll bring the book and you'll give it a title
You'll be the typist and I'll be the writer
So bring on the night
And drive away the light
Bring the kiddies down and make it seem alright
So welcome to the dead zone
It's a circus full of whores
Get your body bought and sold
Blinded by the glitter and the gold
So welcome to the dead zone
It's a circus full of whores
Get your body bought and sold
Blinded by the glitter and the gold
So welcome to the dead zone
It's a circus full of whores
Get your body bought and sold
Blinded by the glitter and the goldEmbed
