The Second Great Depression Lyrics
The second great depression
Lasted longer than I figured
It stuck around and lingered
Surrounded me and conquered
The second great depression
Left me cold and withered
In your eyes I see it mirrored
I can't believe I let it happen

I thought about it a million times
When you and me did nothing but smile
Remember all those days
I thought about it a million times
When you and me did nothing but smile
When forgiveness was the best
Just forget about the rest

The second great depression
I've tried so hard to shake it
Collapse or come together
What happened to forever?
The second great depression (The second great depression)
Lasted longer than I figured (Lasted longer than I figured)
It stuck around and lingered (It stuck around and lingered)
Divided me and conquered
