The Long Goodbye LyricsIt started with a long goodbye
It's finished in the blink of an eye
We could've dreamed, we could've lied
But time's just passed us by
But, oh, the love that you showed
Never had a chance to grow, never grow
Just in case you didn't know, the love that you showed
Never had a chance to grow, never grow
It never
It started with a long goodbye
Now it's fading like a bleached-out sky
50/50, gave no reason why
It ended like the toss of a coin
But, oh, the love that you lost
It never really stopped, never stopped
Just in case you failed to watch, the love that you lost
It never really stopped, never stopped
It never, it never stopped
Guitar!
But, oh, the love that you lost
It never really stopped, never stopped
Just in case you failed to watch, the love that you lost
It never really stopped, never stopped
It never, it never stoppedEmbed
