Heyday of the Blood Lyrics
Seek the opposition
For they are your best friends
Enemies they sometimes go
Way out in the end
Way out in the end

In the heyday of the blood
You're so convinced of your own worth
Your faith fails to diminish
In the heyday of the blood

We followed all our ruins
We filled them all with fear
We must be so addicted
So detached from all we see
So detached from all we see

In the heyday of the blood
Youâ€™re so convinced of your own worth
Your faith fails to diminish
In the heyday of the bloodEmbed
