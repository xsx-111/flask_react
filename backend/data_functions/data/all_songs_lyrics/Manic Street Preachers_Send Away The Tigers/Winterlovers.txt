Winterlovers Lyrics
Na na na na na na na na na

Winter lovers, Winter trees
The beauty of, dead industry
The stuff we have saved, so fataly
Comes crashing down, around me

Winter lovers, Winter trees
Winter longing, falling free
Shielding what we need to see
A deep true love of this country

Winter is as winter was
I look this way just because
For winter lovers, love like brothers
Gives us hope for the ties that splinter
