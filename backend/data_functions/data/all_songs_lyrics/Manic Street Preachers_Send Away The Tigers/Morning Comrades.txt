Morning Comrades Lyrics
Was it all that bad?
Did it mean that much?
Did it help at all?
Did the world really turn?

How could you throw it all away?
Did our conscience dare to stray?
Why did we bother anyway?
When all we got was truth and pain

So good morning comrades
There's work to be done
What can we do but carry on
We’re in denial but having fun
The past is gone for everyone
We've lost the art of being young
So good morning comrades
There's work to be done

You better take all my advice
It’s not so hard to make it right
Never turn off those fading lights
Never turn off those fading lights
How could you throw it all away?
Did our conscience dare to stray
Why did we bother anyway?
When all we got was truth and pain

So good morning comrades
There's work to be done
What can we do but carry on
We're in denial but having fun
The past is gone for everyone
We've lost the art of being young
So good morning comrades
There's work to be done

Was it all that bad?
Did it really mean that much?
Did it help at all?
Did the world really turn?Embed
