1404 LyricsThis country, it could've changed
A little bit of the world, you said
I may have told you this before
I could have been the king of Wales
Maybe we were doomed to fail
But you came and destroyed everything
Still looking for the question mark
At least we've not yet reached the full stop
At least we've not yet reached the full stop
But 1404 got left behind
And we were trapped and stuck in time
We had it all, we had our smiles
And 1404 got left behind
If R. S. Thomas was compulsory
And Saunders Lewis was for free
Glynd≈µr taught our history
And Dylan kept the memories
And Dylan kept the memories
But 1404 got left behind
And we were trapped and stuck in time
We had it all, we had our smiles
And 1404 got left behind
This country, it could've changed
A little bit of the world, you said
I may have told you this before
I could have been the king of WalesEmbed
