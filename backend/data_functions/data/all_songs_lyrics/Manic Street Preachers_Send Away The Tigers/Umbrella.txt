Umbrella LyricsYou have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
These fancy things, will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the world has took its part
And the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
You can run into my arms
It's OK, don't be alarmed
Come with me
So go on and let the rain pour
I can be all you need and more
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
Let the rain come downEmbed
