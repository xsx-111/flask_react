Love Letter to the Future LyricsAnd now is the winter of my discontent
If only the future could rescue it
Disturb nobody with no answers
All except for the president
I broke the golden rule
I should have played the fool
Your love, it has stayed true
The future waits for you
It always seems to start like this
Measuring out life in coffee spoons
Moving forward, stuck on dreams
Revisiting another day's pain
I broke the golden rule
I should have played the fool
Your love, it has stayed true
The future waits for youEmbed
