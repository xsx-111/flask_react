Imperial Bodybags Lyrics
Imperial bodybags
Coming home in dribs and drabs
Life as numbers, with doggy tags
Filled with holes they're coming back
So come out of the skies
Never had a chance to wave goodbye
Thrown away and unhappy
Driven by hypocrisy
Nothing's finished it just fades away
Like a lover who has lost her faith
Nothing's finished it just fades away
Fades away

Imperial bodybags, Prom Queen disposable
Children wrapped in home-made flags
Imperial bodybags, Prom Queen disposable
Children wrapped in home-made flags

And yeah we loved our kids
We're still human like everyone else
Average withdrawn
Stuck in school
Always willing to stick by the rules
Nothing's finished it just fades away
Like a lover who has lost her faith
Nothing's finished it just fades away
Fades away
