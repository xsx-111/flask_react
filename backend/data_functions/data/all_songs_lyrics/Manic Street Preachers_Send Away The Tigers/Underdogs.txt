Underdogs Lyrics
This one's for the freaks
For you're so beautiful
For all the devotion
Written in your soul
This one's for the freaks
For the lost and weak
For the butterflies and devotees
For the disciples of our destiny

And like the underdogs we are
Shining bright but now disappeared
And like the underdogs we are
Passing like some fading stars
Like some fading stars

This one's for the freaks
Beaten down and crushed
The shy and withdrawn
Or just out of touch
May you stay like freaks
May you make mistakes
May your will never break
For underdogs revenge is sweet, revenge is sweet

This one's for the freaks
This one's for the freaks
People like you, need to fuck
To fuck people like me
This one's for the freaks for the lost and weak
This one's for the freaksEmbed
