No Matter Where We Go Lyrics
We'll make a living, darlin', down the road
'Cause I've got you holding on to see where it goes
So don't you feel lonely, I want you to know

I can take you out
I wanna drive around
With you with the windows down
And we can run all night

When I was walking around I couldn't see you alone
I bought a trash heap two-seat, what did we know?
So don't you feel lonely no matter where we go

I wanna take you out
I wanna drive around
With you with the windows down
And we can run all night
Hey mama, don't slow down
Na, na, na, na, na
I wanna take you out
I wanna drive around
With you with the windows down
And we can run all night1Embed
