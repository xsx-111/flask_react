On My Own Lyrics
We won't be surprised again
Darlin', we have no end I know
I think we should try again
Oh, but I want you in my arms

I can't sleep alone when you're on my mind
I'm movin' slowly when I'm on my own
Hurts to see ya go when I know that you're high again

Pushin' my final pin
I can't seem to kick it all
Just forcing the day to end
And I know it, we know it

Baby, I can't sleep alone when you're on my mind
I'm movin' slowly when I'm on my own
Hurts to see ya go but I won't say goodbye again1Embed
