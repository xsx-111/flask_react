Light Upon the Lake Lyrics
Fire across the plains
Light upon the lake
Lonely haze of dawn
When old days are gone

Will life get ahead of me?
Will life get ahead of me?

All these times will change
I can't turn away
Planes are heading home
When old friends are gone

Will life get ahead of me?
Will life get ahead of me?Embed
