The Falls Lyrics
'Til the falls ran dry I was lost inside morning light
I took too much to slow down
These days and nights I can't be found
These days and nights I can't be found

'Cause now I'm not too sure I know
Which way the rising river flows
On the night I lose control
Oh dear, don't you let me go

Til the falls ran dry I was up all night chasing time
In the morning it turns around
I hope I'm climbing when I'm down
I hope I'm climbing when I'm down

'Cause now I'm not too sure I know
Which way the rising river flows
On the night I lose control
Oh dear, don't you let me go2Embed
