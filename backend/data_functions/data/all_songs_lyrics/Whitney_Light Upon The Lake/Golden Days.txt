Golden Days Lyrics
Oh, don't you save me from hangin' on
I tell myself what we had is gone
And after all that I put you through
I get knocked out like I never knew

It kept me real 'til I'm moving on
But you can't leave feeling like you did no wrong
It's a shame I can't get it together now
It's a shame we can't get it together now
'Cause I'm aching but

I fell right in when you gave me up
Those golden days snuck away from us
Lately, I've been close but I'm up to trouble
Those golden days keep you hanging on

It kept me real 'til I'm movin' on
But you can't leave feeling like you did no wrong
It's a shame I can't get it together now
It's a shame we can't get it together now
'Cause I'm searching for those golden days
'Cause I'm searching for those golden days3Embed
