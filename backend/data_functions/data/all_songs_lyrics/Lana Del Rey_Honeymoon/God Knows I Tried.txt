God Knows I Tried Lyrics
Hmmm-mm
Hmmm-mm

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise

Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday they destroy me
But by Friday I'm revived
Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life
Let there be light, let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life

And God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried20Embed
