Sometimes I Feel So Deserted Lyrics
And sometimes I feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way
And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way

And sometimes I feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way
And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way

And sometimes I feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the way
And sometimes you feel so deserted
But I hold on cause help is on the wayEmbed
