Under Neon Lights Lyrics
Under neon lights
Under neon lights
Got no husband
Got no wife
All I want
All I want
All I want
Is this really all I want?

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

As she moves to suicide (As she moves to suicide)
In and under neon lights (Under neon lights)
Got no husband, got no wife (Got no husband)
All I want's a view tonight (Got no wife)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want)
All I want's a view tonight
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Eye to eye, face to face
Oh I guess this is Heaven
Got no pride, got no name
Oh I guess this is Heaven
Oh I guess I'm in Heaven
Oh I guess I'm in Heaven

As she moves to suicide (As she moves to suicide)
In and under neon lights (Under neon lights)
Got no husband, got no wife (Got no husband)
All I want's a view tonight (Got no wife)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want, all I want)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want)
All I want's a view tonight (Is this really all I want?)
Got no husband, got no wife (All I want's a view tonight)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want's a view tonight)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want's a view tonight)
All I want's a view tonight (All I want's a view tonight)
As she moves to suicide
Under neon lights
Got no husband
Got no wife
All I want
All I want
All I want
Is this really all I want?1Embed
