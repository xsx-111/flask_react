Downer Lyrics
Portray sincerity
Act out of loyalty
Defend your free country
Wish away the pain
Hand out lobotomies
And save little families
Surrealistic fantasy
Bland, boring, plain!

Holy now is restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is our whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty master writing

Somebody says that they're not much like I am, I know I can
Make enough up the words
As you go along, I sing a song

Sickening pessimist hypocrite master
Conservative Communist apocalyptic bastard
Thank you dear God for putting me on this Earth
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst!
Holy now is restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is our whole fleece shun in bastard?
Don't feel guilty master writing

Somebody says that they're not much like I am, I know I can
Make enough up the words
As you go along, I sing a song12Embed
