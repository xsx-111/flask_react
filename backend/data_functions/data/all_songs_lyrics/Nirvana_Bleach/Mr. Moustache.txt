Mr. Moustache Lyrics
Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud

Show me how you question questions
Lead the way to my temptations
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud

Easy in an easy chair
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyways
Seal it in a box

I'm new
I'm new

Fill me in on your new vision
Wake me up with indecision
Help me trust your mighty wisdom
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud
Show me how you question questions
Lead the way to my temptation
Take my hand and give it cleaning
Yes, I eat cow, I am not proud

Easy in an easy chair
Poop as hard as rock
I don't like you anyways
Seal it in a box

I'm new
I'm new
I'm new
I'm new, ah!10Embed
