Big Cheese Lyrics
Big cheese, make me
Mine says, go to the office
Big cheese, make me
Mine says, one that stays

Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
Show you all what a man is

Big lies make my
Mine says, go to the office
Big cheese, make me
Message, what is it

Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
She eats glue, how ‘bout you?


Big cheese, make me
Mine says, go to the office
Big cheese, make me
Mine says, one that stays
Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
She eats glue, how ‘bout you?


Black is black, straight back
Need more enemies
Show you all what a man is
She eats glue, how 'bout you?
Show you all what a man is4Embed
