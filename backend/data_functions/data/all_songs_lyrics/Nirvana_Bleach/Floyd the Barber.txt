Floyd the Barber Lyrics
Bell on door clangs, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair, don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face

I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved

Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see, I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard, I hear a zip
Pee-pee pressed against my lips

I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed


I sense others in the room
Opie, Aunt Bee, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I die smothered in Aunt Bee's muff
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed14Embed
