Sifting Lyrics
Afraid to grade
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cross, self-loss
Wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Some fear none
Wouldn't it be fun?

Your eyes
Teacher said
Your eyes
Teacher said
Your eyes
Teacher said
Preacher said

Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Spell the smell
Wouldn't it be fun?
Search for a church
Wouldn't it be fun?
Wet your bed
Wouldn't it be fun?
Cold and coals
Wouldn't it be fun?

Your eyes
Teacher said
Your eyes
Teacher said
Your eyes
Preacher said
Preacher said

Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you

Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you
Don't have nothing for you6Embed
