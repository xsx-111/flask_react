Scoff Lyrics
In my eyes, I'm not lazy
In my face, it's not over
In your room, I'm not older
In your eyes, I'm not worth it

Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my, gimme back my
Gimme back!

Heal a million
Kill a million
Heal a million
Kill a million
Heal a million
Kill a million

In my eyes, I'm not lazy
In my face, it's not over
In your room, I'm not older
In your eyes, I'm not worth it
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my, gimme back my
Gimme back!

Heal a million
Kill a million
Heal a million
Kill a million
Heal a million
Kill a million
Yeah!


In my eyes, I'm not lazy
In my face, it's not over
In your room, I'm not older
In your eyes, I'm not worth it
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my alcohol
Gimme back my, gimme back my
Gimme back

Kill a million
Kill a million
Kill a million
Kill a million
Kill a million
Kill a million
Aah!
Aah!11Embed
