Toxic Garbage Island Lyrics
Mysterious form, soul in the dark
Under this heavy sealing concrete waves
Followed by servants, funeral cort√®ge
This pale ghost is gathering his strength

Ghost, pale
The procession is crawling

Plastic form, dead things, it is now so clear
How could I fail to understand?
Cities are burning, the trees are dying
My heart awake, but still

Pain is killing me
Pain is killing me

Take this pestilent destruction out of my way
The great pacific garbage patch is exhausted
And the world is sliding away in a vortex of floating refuse
With the sacred one you have lost
Plastic bag in the sea
Plastic bag in the sea
Plastic bag in the sea
Plastic bag in the sea3Embed
