After a Fashion LyricsAfter a fashion which is
Purely the mood that takes me
I'll set my mouth on fire and kiss ya 'till ya blister
The tears I cry
Out her
Spell out a word
All for you
Watch the thin boy in dark clothes
Falling over pianos
Trips on the moving carpet
Play like he's deaf and dumb and blind
The answer is
Quite obvious
Oblivious to all but you
After a fashion
She's the answer
After a fashion
I'm the question
After a fashion
She's the answer
After a fashion
I'm the question
Watch the thin boy in dark clothes
Falling over pianos
Trips on the moving carpet
Plays likes he's deaf and dumb and blind
The answer is
Quite obvious
Oblivious to all but you
After a fashion
She's the answer
After a fashion
I'm the question
After a fashion
She's the answer
After a fashion
I'm the questionEmbed
