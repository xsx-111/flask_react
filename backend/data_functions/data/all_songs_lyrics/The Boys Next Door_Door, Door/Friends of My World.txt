Friends of My World LyricsOn this side of the divided room the light grows thin
My world trembles with the sounds of them
They move through the night, they run like fugitives
Escaping with only just their lives
You're friends of my world
You're brides and grooms
Much too soon
You're friends of my world
You pay as you go
You're in my show
On this side of the divided room the light grows dim
In next to no time we're all involved again
And science takes another man
Too frail and scared to know what has possessed him
You're friends of my world
You're this and that
Mud on the doormat
You're friends of my world
You came as you are
You left in my car
Oh baby you are so divine
Across the desert, across the line
And the Sphinx that lies in Egypt's view
That's a friend of my world too
A friend of my world too
A friend of my world too
A friend of my world tooEmbed
