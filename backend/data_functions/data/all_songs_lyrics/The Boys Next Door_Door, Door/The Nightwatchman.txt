The Nightwatchman LyricsDon't watch the nightwatchman
He finds it hard to say hello
He sits in his silent tower
He watches you come and go
And he's waiting for you tonight
Don't watch the nightwatchman
He finds it hard to say hello
And he's waiting for you
And he wanna touch you too
I wanna hold you tonight
Don't watch the nightwatchman
He cries a lonely tear
Locked up in his little tower
He's been there a hundred years
And he's waiting for you tonight
Don't watch the nightwatchman
He finds it hard to say hello
And he's waiting for you
And he wanna touch you too
I wanna hold you tonight
And he's waiting for you
And I wanna touch you too
He wanna hold you tonight
Oh tonight, baby tonight, tonightEmbed
