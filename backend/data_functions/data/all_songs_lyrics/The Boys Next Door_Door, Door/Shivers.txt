Shivers Lyrics
I've been contemplating suicide
But it really doesn't suit my style
So I think I'll just act bored instead
And contain the blood I would've shed?

She makes me feel so ill at ease
My heart is really on it's knees
But I keep a poker face so well
That even mother couldn't tell

But my baby's so vain
She is almost a mirror
And the sound of her name
Sends a permanent shiver down my
Spine

I keep her photograph against my heart
For in my life she plays a starring part
All alcohol and cigarettes
There is no room for cheap regrets

She makes me feel so ill at ease
My heart is really on it's knees
But i keep a poker face so well
That even mother couldn't tell
But my baby's so vain
She is almost a mirror
And the sound of her name
Sends a permanent shiver down my
