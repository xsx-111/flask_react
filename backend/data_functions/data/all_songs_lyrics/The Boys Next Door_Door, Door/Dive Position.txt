Dive Position LyricsDoes a rain dance in my room and then assumes a dive
Position
Had a vision it's looking grim, all damp with grief in
Her water wings
I... Sigh... To... You
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Hear the taps fill the bath, it's almost dark in a dive
Position
My disposition I shouldn't have thought at all
Draped in shame she runs the gauntlet
I... Sigh... To... You
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Oh, let's all start again
We can still be friends
We can just stop...
... And I sigh
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Does a rain dance in my room and then assumes a dive
Position
Had a vision it's looking grim
All draped in pain, oh, such a big splash
I... Sigh... To... You
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch me
Touch meEmbed
