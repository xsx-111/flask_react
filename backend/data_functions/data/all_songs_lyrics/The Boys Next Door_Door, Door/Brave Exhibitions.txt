Brave Exhibitions LyricsYou won't find me in your handbook of heroes
You won't see me in your hall of fame
All the girls they come around
And remove the mystery, oh
Do you get the picture?
I can get embarrassed too, you know
I would be your perfect host
I would vaseline my teeth for you
I'd be counting on a brave exhibition
I am a zoo if only
You would kiss me just like you used to
Then I might take a chance too
My doctor is ill
My teacher's gone on holidays
Looks like I'm on my own
I'm so scared to be alone with you
Do you get the picture?
I can get sorta nervous too, you know
All the girls they come around
And take off their mystery, oh no
I'd be counting on a brave exhibition
I am a zoo if only
You would kiss me just like you used to
Then I might take a chance too, on you
I'd be counting on a brave exhibition
I am a zoo if only
You would kiss me just like you used to
Then I might take a chance too, on youEmbed
