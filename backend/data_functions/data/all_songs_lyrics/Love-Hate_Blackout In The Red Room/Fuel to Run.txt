Fuel to Run LyricsSmash bam biff boom crack
Party still goin' six in the mornin'
Jim Beam, Courvoisier and Jack
We're goin' down
I need some fuel
I need some fuel
I need some fuel to run
I need some fuel to run
Yo Zeke, stop at the liquor store
We'll want some more
I'd like to introduce you to my fifth
That's who I'm with
I need some fuel
I need some fuel
I need some fuel to run
I need some fuel to run
I need some fuel to run
I need some fuel to run
I'm free to exercise my downward mobility
I'm free to exercise my downward mobility
My downward mobility
I need some fuel to run
I need some fuel to run
I need some fuel to run
I need some fuel to runEmbed
