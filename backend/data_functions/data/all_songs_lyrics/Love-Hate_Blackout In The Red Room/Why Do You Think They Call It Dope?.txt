Why Do You Think They Call It Dope? LyricsWhy do you think they call it dope?
Nighttime, shooting star
The sun started to rain
Trees lost branches, gurus trances
Black-brassiered dancers, little dears
Showdown's coming, it's no joke
Mouth is running, it's a stroke
That's what I think when I'm so fucked up
I can't even find the door
Why do you think they call it dope?
(Whoa, whoa)
Why do you think they call it dope?
(Whoa, whoa)
When your heart beats fast, you're so broke
In your car with the red lights flashing
Look sincere, smell like beer
Roach in the ashtray, going to the pokey
Thirty days later, ten bucks left
Hands are shaking, looking for a dime bag
Why do you think they call it dope?
(Whoa, whoa)
Why do you think they call it dope?
(Whoa, whoa)
Dirty little dopers on dope so bad
Dirty little dopers on dope so bad
Ooh
When two and two turns into five
You'll probably see it my way
When bad is good, like it should
Things turn upside down
Some people say its hip to say no
My town it's green light go
For party rockin' anglels now it's trigger happy
Slang-bang-pow
Why do you think they call it dope?
(Whoa, whoa)
Why do you think they call it dope?
(Whoa, whoa)
Why do you think they call it dope?
(Whoa, whoa)
Why do you think they call it dope?
(Whoa, whoa)Embed
