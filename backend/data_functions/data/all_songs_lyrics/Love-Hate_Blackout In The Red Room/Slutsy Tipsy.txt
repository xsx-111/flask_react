Slutsy Tipsy LyricsYou thought you'd blow my mind
You thought you'd suck my blood
You thought you'd be
Sweet a little slutsy tipsy (tipsy)
You thought you'd buy some beer
You thought you'd crucify me
You thought you'd be
Sweet a little slutsy tipsy (tipsy)
Sweet a little slutsy tipsy, oh
You won't be alone
It's warm inside
You thought you'd take me home
You thought you'd sacrifice me
You thought you'd be
Sweet a little slutsy tipsy (tipsy)
Sweet a little slutsy tipsy
Sweet a little slutsy tipsy (tipsy)
Sweet a little slutsy tipsy
Love is a special thingEmbed
