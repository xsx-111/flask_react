Straightjacket LyricsGonna get a little laid
Fuck off
No sticks and stones
Gonna get it right
Some people think I'm going crazy
Ooh, some people think I'm mad mad mad
Some people think I'm gonna hurt somebody
Some people think I'm gonna hurt myself
Oh, put your straightjacket on
Put your straight straightjacket on
Put your straightjacket on
Put your straight straightjacket, straight straightjacket on
Gonna get it right
I think I'm gonna go out tonight
I think I'm gonna get into a fight
I think I'm gonna knock somebody's head off, ooh yeah
I think I might murder somebody, yeah yeah
Oh, put your straightjacket on
Put your straight straightjacket on
Put your straightjacket on
Put your straight straightjacket, straight straightjacket on
Oh, put your straightjacket on
Put your straight straightjacket on
Put your straightjacket on
Put your straight straightjacket, straight straightjacket
Put your straightjacket on
Put your straight straightjacket on
Put your straightjacket on
Put your straight straightjacket, straight straightjacket
Straight straightjacket onEmbed
