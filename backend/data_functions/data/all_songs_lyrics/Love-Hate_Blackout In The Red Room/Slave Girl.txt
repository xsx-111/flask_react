Slave Girl LyricsWhen the rain comes, don't cry
'Cause I'll keep you dry
When the wind blows, don't sigh
'Cause our love won't die
Down from Louisiana, playin' in a band
She moved to Hollywood, bottle in her hand
Wears a black bandana, blood red tattoo
I know she's wrong but I'm a bad guy too
She's a gang bang slave girl, I'll be your homeboy
She's a gang bang slave girl, I'll be your homeboy
Gang bang slave girl
Gang bang slave girl
Daisy growing side of the road
.45 Smith & Wesson, cock and load
You better run, better pay your rent
'Cause every shell she shoots counts for money never spent
She's a gang bang slave girl, I'll be your homeboy
She's a gang bang slave girl, I'll be your homeboy
Gang bang slave girl
Gang bang slave girl
And on our anniversary, we'll cruise the barrio
I'll hear your favorite song on the radio
Gang bang slave girl
Gang bang slave girl
And on our anniversary, we'll cruise the barrio
I'll hear your favorite song on the radio
When the rain comes, don't cry
'Cause I'll keep you dry
When the wind blows, don't sigh, my my my
'Cause our love won't die
'Cause our love won't dieEmbed
