Hell, CA., Pop. 4 LyricsShe's a lone bitch biker with a skull tattoo
Rides a mean black Harley, carries buck knife too
Outlaw Sheila in a leather vest
They say she's worst, I know she's best
'Cause love is the unknown rider
Hitchin' down the road with about ten cents
She picks you up, buys some cold Budweiser
Stealin' down the highway, wind in your hair
You don't know her name but you don't care
'Cause love is the unknown rider
Spray paint, one black can, I'm really famous man
On the walls that I spray on
Black streak, cool freak, long hair, loud guitar
Bloody mouth preacher, sinners go out at twelve
'Cause I'm from Hell, California, population four
I'm from Hell, California, population four
Lipstick on the mirror, bee's honey on her thigh
Lingerie past issue
I commit fantacide
'Cause she's unknown she's the unknown rider
So what who gives a fuck, I live in Hell, Hell is my home
I'm from Hell, California, population four
I'm from Hell, California, population four
I want some every night
Can't stop myself or the world from turning
I don't even know your name
But I think we'll party just the same
I'm from Hell, California, population four
I'm from Hell, California, population four
I'm from Hell, California, population four
I'm from Hell, California, population fourEmbed
