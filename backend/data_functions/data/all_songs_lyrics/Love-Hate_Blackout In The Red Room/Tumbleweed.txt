Tumbleweed LyricsI'm tumblin,' tublin' round
I'm tumblin', my feet don't touch the ground
'Cause I got no, got no place to go
Maybe if I did, I'd settle down my roots would grow
I'm a tumbleweed
Ooh, I'm tumblin,' tumblin' round
I'm tumblin' like a wind blowin' through your town
Got a sharp thorn sticking in my side
On this dusty road I'm goin' for a ride
I'm a tumbleweed
Tumbleweed bad seed
No one I need
Tumbleweed bad seed
Got a home on a ghost town highway
Ooh, I'm a tumbleweed
I'm tumblin,' tumblin' round
I'm tumblin', someday I will be gone
When I grow old, grow old and pass away
Need to spread my ashes on a windy day
I'm a tumbleweed
Tumbleweed bad seed
No one I need
Tumbleweed bad seed
Got a home on a ghost town highway
Oh, I'm a tumbleweed
Oh, I'm runnin'
Oh, I'm runnin'
Oh, I'm runnin'
Oh, I'm runnin', I'm runnin'Embed
