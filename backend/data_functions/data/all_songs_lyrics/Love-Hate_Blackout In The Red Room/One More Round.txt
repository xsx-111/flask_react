One More Round LyricsBlack-out bill, he's my bud, he brings over Jack
In the car to the Whisky
It's 1:30, stinking drunk, fifty cents in my pocket
Turn around, Vicky
On the cuff, on the house, line 'em up, line 'em down
One more round
Quarter of two, what to do
Sharks start to circle my my my my my my my
Last call alcohol
Time we said bye bye my my my my my my, Vicky
On the cuff, on the house, line 'em up, line 'em down
One more round
One more round
She said "Start trottin' boy, my friends are thirsty"
Start trottin' boy, my friends are thirsty
Start trottin' boy, my friends are thirsty
Fourteen yellow roses, windows for the light
One more round
One more round
One more round
One more round
Yeah
One more round
Yeah
One more round
Yeah
YeahEmbed
