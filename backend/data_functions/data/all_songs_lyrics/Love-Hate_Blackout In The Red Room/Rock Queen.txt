Rock Queen LyricsI got my wine
Get out of my way
Got a chip on my shoulder
Had a real bad day
Met a little girl
Just thirteen
She's a knock-down blue-eyed slut psycho-virgin tease
Rock queen, thirteen, buxom blonde, bad dream
Let me touch your cookies
Let me eat your cookies now
Got some time
Won't go wrong
Sittin' on the sidewalk
Singing songs
Take my baby home
On the scene
Turns out she's a koochie-koochie-koochie
Rock queen, thirteen, buxom blonde, bad dream
Let me touch your cookies
Let me eat your cookies
Rock queen, thirteen, buxom blonde, bad dream
Let me touch your cookies
Let me eat your cookies now, oh yeah
Do like you do
Yeah, yeah, c'mon, cmon
Turns out she's a koochie-koochie-koochie
Rock queen, thirteen, buxom blonde, bad dream
Let me touch your cookies
Let me eat your cookies
Rock queen, thirteen, buxom blonde, bad dream
Let me touch your cookies
Let me eat your cookies
Rock queen, thirteen, buxom blond, bad dream
Let me touch your cookies
Let me eat your cookies now, oh yeahEmbed
