Mary Jane LyricsDon't you worry, don't feel no pain
Just wrap your lips around her
Don't you fret none, don't feel no shame
We're gonna roll 'er up, Mary Jane, yo
She's my baby rocket stone, her eyes are green
She smells like candy and her number is 13
They say she's growin' wild, wild like a weed
They say she's loco crazy
There's somethin' I best tell you
I'm loco crazy too
Mary Jane, I want you
Mary Jane, I need you
And I heard you were lookin' for some action
And I think I got just what you need
And we were sittin' in a circle
Passin' 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Mary Jane, I want you
Mary Jane, I need you
I found my connection down at the beach
And my heart started racin' 'cause she's at arm's reach
I don't know why I feel this way 'bout you
But I do
I am hallucinating
This world, fine mess we're in
I am imaginating
Come to me Mary, Mary Jane
Mary Jane, I want you (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane, I need you (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane, I want you (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane, I need you (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane, I want you (Mary Jane)
Mary Jane, I need you (Mary Jane)
Green buds inside you
Green buds inside you (Mary Jane)
Green buds inside you
Green buds insideEmbed
