Blackout in the Red Room LyricsSay you're going drinking tonight
It's party time
Gonna turn bad to maybe
Say you're gonna paint the town red
It's party time
Gonna turn bad to maybe
Blackout in the red room
Blackout in the red room
So you say you can't remember
It's party time
So you say you can't remember
So you woke up blind (so you woke up blind)
It's party time
So you say you can't remember, yeah
Blackout in the red room
Blackout in the red room
Blackout in the red room
Blackout in the red room
Blackout in the red room
Blackout in the red room
Blackout in the red room, get down
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon red room
Red room, red room
Red room, red room
In the red roomEmbed
