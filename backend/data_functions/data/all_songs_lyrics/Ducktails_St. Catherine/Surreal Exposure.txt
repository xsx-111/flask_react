Surreal Exposure Lyrics
Surreal exposure when you come over
It's crimson and clover
Keep my composure
When you told me lies, I wasn't surprised
Time wasn't right
Now love is revived

There's a chance you'll never know
The pain that I had to let go
I feel it running through my veins
And temptation I can't explain

Something in your mind changed in time
And I just don't know why
But I'm not asking why

Surreal exposure is billowing over
I keep it in my mind
Don't leave, don't leave me behind
Soundtrack to my life
I'll see you later tonight
Until then, you'll realize
There's a reason we are alive
Surreal exposure is billowing over
Surreal exposure, it's billowing overEmbed
