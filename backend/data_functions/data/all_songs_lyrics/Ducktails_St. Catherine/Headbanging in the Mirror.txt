Headbanging in the Mirror Lyrics
Headbanging in the mirror
Wish I could see so much clearer
Just let me come down from this speedy
Afternoon interior dream

In my late twenties
I flew to LA
Born in New Jersey
I drove on the highway
Working nine to five
I won't play that game
When you caught my eye
I wasn't the same

Now they're headbanging in the mirror
Now I can see so much clearer
Just let me come down from this speedy
Afternoon interior dream


Headbanging in the mirror
And I can see so much clearer
Don't ever let me come down from this
Afternoon interior dreamEmbed
