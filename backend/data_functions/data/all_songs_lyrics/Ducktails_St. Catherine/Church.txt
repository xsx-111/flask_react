Church Lyrics
There's a temporary tracing and light ink
On the ceiling of the only train running underground
I read the first few lines
The characters are fashionable
They never speak and they look away
When I read their words out loud
The music and the dancing stops

Pictures are real
Here where your face is so close to the window
No questions asked
Millions of pages that fall out
From the top of the tallest buildings
Tell me your story


Pictures are real
Here where your face is so close to the window
No questions asked
Millions of pages that fall out
From the top of the tallest buildings
Tell me your story
Pictures are real
Here where your face is so close to the window
No questions asked
Millions of pages that fall out
From the top of the tallest buildings
Tell me your story

There's a temporary tracing and light ink
On the ceiling of the only train running underground
I read the first few lines
The characters are fashionable
They never speak and they look away
When I read their words out loud
The music and the dancing stopsEmbed
