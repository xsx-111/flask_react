St. Catherine LyricsNothing less and nothing more
Don’t know what else to do
Disintegrate into the light
And I’ll fall right into you
It’s a pair of eyes
What a novelty
I’ll distract myself
From the fantasy
Blinded by the light
There’s nothing more to see tonight
St. Catherine comes alive
The image of an angel sighsEmbed
