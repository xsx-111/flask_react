Into the Sky LyricsThere's no way to realize
How long you will be lonely
When will you change your mind?
The water is running dry
Remember December
And you'll know why
The winter it lingered
On into the sky
December you made me try
I tried to change your mind
You never told me why oh why
Why you're never at my side
Remember December
And you'll know why
The winter it lingered
On into the sky
But now winter is over
And spring's close by
I hope you've come around
And changed your mind
The months keep rolling on
And you'll never wait so long
There's no way to slow down love
In fact it only speeds upEmbed
