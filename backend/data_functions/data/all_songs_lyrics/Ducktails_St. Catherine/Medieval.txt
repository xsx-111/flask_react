Medieval LyricsI’m sending out a picture of myself
Cause you never return
My calls and texts don’t get to you
I just wish to hear from you soon
Until you do I’ll wonder how you
Spend your days & who’s in your arms
You can take yourself away but I will
Still be here today
When I drive past your house at night
The streets illuminated light
Who’s in your room, who do you talk to
It’s all in the past, my feelings for you
Once in a while it goes away
The thought of you it fades
And every time I look for you my heart just pulls awayEmbed
