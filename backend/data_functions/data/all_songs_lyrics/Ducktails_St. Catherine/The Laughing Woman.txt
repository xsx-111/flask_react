The Laughing Woman LyricsLaughing woman do you worry about anything?
Nothing seems to bother you not even your bad knees
Your husband is concerned with your behavior
He’s upset
He sits by the window with his head inside his hands
Can you stop thinking life’s a joke
When you know everybody hurts
Pretending everything’s just fine
Leaving your dignity behind
Maybe the laughing woman’s been right along
Her husband just brings her down
But she just rides alongEmbed
