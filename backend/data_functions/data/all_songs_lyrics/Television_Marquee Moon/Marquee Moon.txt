Marquee Moon Lyrics
I remember
Ooh, how the darkness doubled
I recall
Lightning struck itself
I was listening
Listening to the rain
I was hearing
Hearing something else

Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Well, there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
Just waiting

I spoke
To a man down at the tracks
And I ask him
How he don't go mad
He said "Look here, Junior
Don't you be so happy
And for Heaven's sake
Don't you be so sad"
Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Well, there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
Hesitating

Well, the Cadillac
It pulled out of the graveyard
Pulled up to me
All they said, "Get in"
"Get in"
Then the Cadillac
It puttered back into the graveyard
Me
I got out again

Life in the hive puckered up my night
A kiss of death, the embrace of life
Over there I stand 'neath the Marquee Moon
I ain't waitin', uh uh


I remember
How the darkness doubled
I recall
Lightning struck itself
I was listening
Listening to the rain
I was hearing
Hearing something else7Embed
