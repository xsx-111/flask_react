Torn Curtain Lyrics
Torn curtain reveals another play
Torn curtain, such an exposÃ©!
I'm uncertain when beauty meets abuse
Torn curtain loves all ridicule

(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Flowing by like tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) The years I've seen before

Torn curtain giving me the glance
Torn curtain is bringing on the trance
But I'm not hurting, holding to the thread
Torn curtain lifts me on the tread

(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Holding back the tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling by like years
(Years, years) The tears I never shed

Torn curtain, feels more like a rake
Torn curtain, how much does it take?
Burn it down
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Holding back the tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) The years I've seen before

(Tears, tears)
(Years, years)
(Tears, tears)
(Years, years)1Embed
