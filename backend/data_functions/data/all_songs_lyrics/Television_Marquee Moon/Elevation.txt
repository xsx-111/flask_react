Elevation Lyrics
The last word
Is the lost word
Why don't you say so?
Say so

I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores

Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head

Now, you give me no trouble
And you give me no help
It is the clown
That works so well

I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores

Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Our lips are sealed
Our breath is burning
These cold, wild seas
Have left us turning

But I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores

Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my headEmbed
