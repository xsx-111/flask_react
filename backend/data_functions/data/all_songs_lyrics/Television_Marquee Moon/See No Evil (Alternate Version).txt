See No Evil (Alternate Version) LyricsWhat I want
I want now
And it's a whole lot more
Than anyhow
I want to fly
Fly a fountain
I want to jump, jump, jump
Jump a mountain
I understand all
(I see no)
Destructive urges
(I see no)
It seems so perfect
(I see no)
I see, I see no evil
I get ideas
I get a notion
I want a nice little boat
Made out of ocean
I get your point
You're so sharp
Getting good reactions
With your 'BeBo' talk
I understand all
(I see no)
Destructive urges
(I see no
It seems so perfect
(I see no)
I see, I see no evil
Don't say unconscious
No don't say doom
Well if you got to say it
Don't let me leave this room
'Cuz what I want
I want now
And it's a whole lot more
Than anyhow, get it
I understand all
(I see no)
Destructive urges
(I see no
It seems so perfect
(I see no)
I see, I see no evil
I'm runnin' wild with the one I love
(I see no evil)
I'm really crazy with the one I love
(I see no evil)
I should be dancing with the one I love
(I see no evil)
 of the one you love
(I see no evil)
 of the one you love
(I see no evil)
 of the one you love
(I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love
(I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love
(I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love
(I see no evil)
