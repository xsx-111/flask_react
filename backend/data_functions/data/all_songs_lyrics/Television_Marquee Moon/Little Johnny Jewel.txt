Little Johnny Jewel LyricsNow Little Johnny Jewel
Oh, he's so cool
He had no decision
He's just trying to tell a vision
But some thought that this was sad
And others thought it mad
They just scratching the surface;
J.J., he could do the floor kiss
Oh, was he on display?
No, no, not today
All that guy ever said
He said, "I want my little wing-head"
He half-asleep at night
Over his head, sensation of flight
And he wake up dreaming
Dreaming...
And he run down to the airport--
The rush, the roar
And he crouched down behind the fence
With a chest full of lights
Then...
He loses his senses
Oh, Little Johnny Jewel
He's so cool
But if you see him looking lost
You ain't gotta come on so boss
And you know that he's paid
You know that he's paid the price
All you gotta do for that guy...
Is wink your eyeEmbed
