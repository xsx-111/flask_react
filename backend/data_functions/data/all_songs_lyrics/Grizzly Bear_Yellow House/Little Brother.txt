Little Brother LyricsWide eyed and up in arms
My little brother was a solemn one
He always had his quiet corner
Pride of my countrymen
My little brother will be born again
Just give us back our quiet corner
Pride of my countrymen
My little brother will be born again
Just give us back our quiet corner
Now go back to the other side of my bed
I'll go back to the place where you get started
And I'll sleep, just put the pillows under my headEmbed
