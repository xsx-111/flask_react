On a Neck, On a Spit Lyrics

My messenger in disguise
Makes up for such short goodbyes
You can't come home again
Each time it's different
And the yards around your feet
Fall away while you're asleep



Each day, spend it with me now
Each day, I spend it with me now
Each day, I spend it with me now
All my time, spend it with me, but...

Each day, spend it with you now
Each day, I spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you, but...
Each day, spend it with you now
Each day, I spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you, but
Out here, no one can hear me
Out here, nobody can hear me
Out here, no one can hear me


Each day, spend it with you now
Each day, I spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you now
All my time, spend it with you, but
Out here, no one can hear me
Out here, nobody can hear me
Out here, no one can hear me3Embed
