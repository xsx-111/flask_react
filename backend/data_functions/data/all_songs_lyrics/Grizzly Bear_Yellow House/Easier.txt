Easier Lyrics
I know, I know
The doors won't close
The pipes all froze
Just let it go

I know, I know
Argue with me
The doors won't close
I've got plenty of
The pipes all froze
Dishes and time
Just let it go
Cords in a bind
I know, I know
Knots that we make
The doors won't close
Fatal mistakes
The pipes all froze
Let's recreate
Just let it go
An easier time

Because I still can't find you
Because I still can't find you2Embed
