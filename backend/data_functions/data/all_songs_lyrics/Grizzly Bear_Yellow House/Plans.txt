Plans LyricsJuan from Argentina
Such a strange predicament we find ourselves in
Baby it's a long way to South America
Every option I have costs more than I've got
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there
All I have to give
Seems to be all over you and everyone else
I guess I'm guilty spreading thin with my love
If you trust in me, if I could I would be there2Embed
