Central and Remote LyricsIn the wind, in the yoke
My ride will go
Central, remote
Any further and I'll know
Pressing matters bear
Through trials and time
I keep my feet right
In line for flight
So we never recognize
Pressing matters bear
Enable wear and tear on you
Tear on you
Remind me
Tear on you, wear on you1Embed
