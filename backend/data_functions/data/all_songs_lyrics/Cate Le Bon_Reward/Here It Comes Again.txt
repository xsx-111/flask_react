Here It Comes Again Lyrics
Modern debt
Essential luck
The dog hair in the gloss
Fortunate or not enough?

Set in a frame
Here it comes again

Man alive
This solitude
Is wrinkles in the dirt
I borrowed love from carnivals

Set it in a frame
Here it comes again
Set it in a frame (Set it in a frame)
Here it comes again

Half-draped eyes in a liquid night
I fall apart when you do
Set it in a frame (Set it in a frame)
Set it in a frame (Set it in a frame)
Here it comes againEmbed
