Magnificent Gestures Lyrics
Truly I like to dream
Romance is company
Permeates the concrete graft
Puts my head in a car park

Hold a hand, talk to me
Assume the weight of family
Sell the billboard gallery
She was born with no lips, drip, drip, drips

Hey now
Magnificent gestures
Could hold my love
Could open windows
But the room escapes me
The teachers let go
It's such a shame
And I'm writing it down
We will have to talk
But I'm writing it down
The room escapes me
And I'm writing it down
Forever be on guard
Forever be on guard
Forever be on guard
Forever be on guard
Forever be on guard

Truly I'm at your feet
Turning cards from memory
Pinball for the royal lip
Her heart is a skip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip

Time will repeat it
Time will defile
I can't repeat it
I was born with no lips, drip, drip, drips

Hey now
Magnificent gestures
Could hold my love
Could open windows
But the room escapes me
The teachers let go
It's such a shame
And I'm writing it down
We will have to talk
Magnificent gestures
And I just feel low
I don't know why
The mood escapes me
And I'm writing it down
The room escapes me
And I'm writing it down
She has her teacher's laugh
She has her brother's eyes
Her eyesEmbed
