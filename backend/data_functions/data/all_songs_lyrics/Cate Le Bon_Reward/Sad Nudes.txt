Sad Nudes Lyrics
Sad nudes in my room
Sad nudes in my room
Sad nudes

Sad promises from all the clowns you used to soothe
Like fools we moved

Pick up the phone
Take the call from your mother
She really wants you to answer
Fear is the pivot and shame is on its knees
And the more you feel the more you have to lose

Sad nudes
Sad nudes in my room
Sad nudes in my room
Sad nudes

The settlement is rolling down that mountain soon
It moves through you
This is your gold and you are the woman
Bias beats hard and I don't sleep
Factories cold under owner-spectator
And the cross you never used becomes the news

Sad nudes in my roomEmbed
