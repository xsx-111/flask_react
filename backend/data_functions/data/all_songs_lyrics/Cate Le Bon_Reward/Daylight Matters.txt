Daylight Matters Lyrics
Wide of the line in occasional bloom
Still ahead of the night
Still never not there
And I'm never gonna be there again
Promises speak in
Confusion and dice
A day in the life
Arranging the chairs
And I'm never gonna live it again

Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you're not here
Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you've gone

Why do they stick when your lips read like stone?
Mouthing the lines, returning the air
And I'm never gonna feel them again

Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you're not here
Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you've gone
If I'm never gonna see it again
It's too late now
Your money's lent
Dreams I've had and never shared
Sacrificed the daylight matters
Ooh, la, ah
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you're not here
Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
But you've gone2Embed
