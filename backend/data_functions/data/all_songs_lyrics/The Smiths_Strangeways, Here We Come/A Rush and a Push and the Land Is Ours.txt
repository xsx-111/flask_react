A Rush and a Push and the Land Is Ours Lyrics
Oh hello
I am the ghost of Troubled Joe
Hung by his pretty white neck
Some eighteen months ago
I travelled to a mystical time zone
And I missed my bed
And I soon came home

They said, "There's too much caffeine in your bloodstream
And a lack of real spice in your life"
I said, "Leave me alone because I'm alright, dad
Surprised to still be on my own"

Oh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the strain of the pain again

A rush and a push and the land that we stand on is ours
It has been before, so it shall be again
And people who are uglier than you and I
They take what they need and just leave

Oh, but don't mention love
I'd hate the pain of the strain all over again
A rush and a push and the land we stand on is ours
It has been before, so why can't it be now?
And people who are weaker than you and I
They take what they want from life

Oh, but don't mention love
No, no, don't mention love

A rush and a push and the land we stand on is ours
Your youth may be gone, but you're still a good man
So phone me, phone me
So phone me, phone me, phone me

Oh, I think I'm in love
Oh, I think I'm in love
Oh, I think I'm in love (I think I'm in love)
Oh, I think I'm in love, oh7Embed
