Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me Lyrics

Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm

Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm

So tell me how long
Before
The last one

And tell me how long
Before
The right one

This story is old
I know
But it goes on
This story is old
I know
But it goes on
It goes on
And on...
Goes on
Goes on13Embed
