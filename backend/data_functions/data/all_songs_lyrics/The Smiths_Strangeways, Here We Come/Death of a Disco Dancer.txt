Death of a Disco Dancer Lyrics
The death of a disco dancer
Well, it happens a lot 'round here
And if you think peace
Is a common goal
That goes to show
How little you know
The death of a disco dancer
Well, I'd rather not get involved
I never talk to my neighbour
I'd rather not get involved
Oh

Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
But maybe in the next world
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
Very nice
But maybe in the next world
Maybe in the next world
Maybe in the next world
Love, peace and harmony?
Love, peace and harmony?
Oh, very nice
Very nice
Very nice
But maybe in the next world
Maybe in the next world

(The next world)
(Maybe in the next world)
The death of a disco dancer
The death of a disco dancer
The death of a disco dancer
