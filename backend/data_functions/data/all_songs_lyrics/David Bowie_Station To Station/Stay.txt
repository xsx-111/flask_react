Stay Lyrics
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too3Embed
