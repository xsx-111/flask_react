Mother LyricsThis war's a motherfucker
How many sons will we kill today
On fours little brother
Tell me what the view's like from the ground
Your love is a killer
Killing all this love in me
We are so full of terror
Vicious kiss your love is longing dee
Love, love, love will strike you down
Love, love
Where the anger is hot
Where opinion is deep
Understanding is shot is dead is dead is dead
Where the linen is cheap
Where the weapons are not
All the mothers will weep is dead is dead is dead
Will strike you down
Love, love, love will strike you down
We're drawn to a torture
I can't take it anymore
On fours little mother
Tell me what the view's like from the ground
Love, love, love will strike you down
Love, love, love will strike us downEmbed
