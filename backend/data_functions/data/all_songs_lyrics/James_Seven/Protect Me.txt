Protect Me LyricsOh dear what can the matter be
Princess, dreaming again
Fearful, live life more easily
Darkness, leave her in peace
Always wanting help
Will make you weak
No such place has help
But in your dreams
Climb out of your well
Protect me
Protect me
Angel, what is possessing me
Feeling, making me weak
Falling under your spell again
Wanting, love's out of reach
Climb out of your well
It's not so deep
The price of living life
Is not so steep
No such place has hel
Protect me
Protect me
Here they come again, here they come again, here they come again
Always wanting help
Will make you weak
The price of loving life
Does not come cheap
Climb out of your well
Protect me
Protect meEmbed
