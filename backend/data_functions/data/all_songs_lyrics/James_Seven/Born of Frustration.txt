Born of Frustration Lyrics
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)

All this frustration
I can't meet all my desires
Strange conversation
Self control has just expired
All an illusion
Only in my head you don't exist
Who are you foolin'?
Don't need a shrink or an exorcist

La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
(Oooooh)

Show me the movie
Of who you are and where you're from
Born of frustration
Caught upon the webs you spun
Where's the confusion?
A vision of what life is like
Show me the movie
That doesn't deal in black and white
Stop, stop, talkin' 'bout who's to blame
When all that counts is how to change
Stop, stop, talkin' 'bout who's to blame
When all that counts is how to change

La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la

All this frustration
All this frustration
Who put brown owl eyes on a butterfly's wings?
All this frustration
All this frustration
Who gave the leopard spots and taught the birds to sing?
Born of frustration
Born of frustration
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)

I'm living in the weirdest dream
Where nothing is the way it seems
Where no one's who they need to be
Where nothing seems that real to me
'Bout time we filled our lives
Upon the walls of gold, no solid ground
The world is spinnin' endlessly
We're clinging to our own beliefs
Born of frustration
Born of frustration
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)2Embed
