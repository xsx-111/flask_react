Sound Lyrics
Ape your father's sins, your mother's mood swings
To perfection
Fall into a spin, shed another skin
Strip away all your protection

Laugh at the wonder of it all
Laugh so loud you break the fall
And you see the gathering clouds

Cry at the sadness of the world
Cry so long you break its cold
And you hear the gathering sounds
Do everything you fear
In this there's power
Fear is not to be afraid of

Laugh at the wonder of it all
Laugh so loud you break your fall
And you hear the gathering sounds

Come, dip on in
Leave your bones, leave your skin
Leave your past, leave your craft
Leave your suffering heart
Come, dip on in
Leave your bones, leave your skin
Leave your past, leave your craft
Leave your suffering heart
