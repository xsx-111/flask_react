Heavens LyricsI've been sitting on top of these rocks
Watching the waters rise
Everyone that I have loved has gone floating by
I've been praying for the king of the world to come rescue me
From a land that's lost in dreams
From a land that's lost in dreams
Are you waiting for the heavens
Are you waiting for the heavens to descend
Waiting for the depend, the depend, the depend
Are you waiting for the heavens
Are you waiting for the heavens to descend
Waiting for the depend, the depend, the depend
I've been looking through microscopes to see how our life begins
I've been training my lens on the stars to see where it ends
But it's this living in between that's bringing me down
To a land that's lost in dreams
To a land that's lost in dreams
To a land that's lost in dreams
Are you waiting for the heavens
Are you waiting for the heavens to descend
Waiting for the depend, the depend, the depend
Are you waiting for the heavens
Are you waiting for the heavens to descend
Waiting for the depend, the depend, the dependEmbed
