Live a Love of Life LyricsI don't believe Jesus was a human being
I've never met a prophet whose sheets are clean
Only in a film could he be so cool
But only in life can fathers be so cruel
What in the world are you dreaming of
To sacrifice the son you love
You send your children off to war
As if you care, as if you care
To live the love of life, to live your love of life
To live your love of life, your love of life
Your love of life
Prophets have been sacrificed for common good
What we want slugs it out with what we should
All of these commercials are just teasing greed
Everybody's restless with a deeper need
Open your eyes, and what do you see
A system made to crush our needs
A saviour nailed to every tree
As if you care, as if you care
The prophet said, the prophet said
To live the love of life, to live your love of life
To live your love of life, your love of life
Your love of life, your love of life
Where's your love of life
The prophet said, the prophet said
The profit's here, the profit's here
Where's you're love of life, tell me your love of life
Tell me your love of life
To sacrifice the son you love
You send your children off to war
As if you care, as if you careEmbed
