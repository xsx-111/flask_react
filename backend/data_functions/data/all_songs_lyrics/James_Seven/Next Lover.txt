Next Lover LyricsWho are you dreaming of now
Is she flesh real
Or carved in memory
Who are you dreaming of now
Is she flesh real
Or bloodless fantasy
From a film heroine
There goes innocence fading away
Here comes bitterness after you pay
For believing in stories man-made
Yes, we all want to be your next lover
But we scared so we're running you down
Yes, we all want to be your next lover
But your beauty's too far above ground
From a film heroine
We will laugh at the worst of your jokes
Steal a kiss if we can, buy you flowers and gifts
Every move is a plan, you can measure this man
By the depths of his lies, you can measure this man
Yes we all want to be your next lover
Yes we all want to be your next lover
We are driven by things you can't feel
Are we stealing or are we the steal
So we lie like a priest
To slide under and into inside
Love is cruel but love seldom kind
Yes we all want to be your next lover
Yes we all want to be your next lover
I can lie like the best of them
Wait with the patience of man
Seem so understanding
While I'm making my plans
I'm so full of desire, I've forgotten your name
I'm so full of desire, I could burst into flames
I'm so full of desire I can't hope to control
This desire that's closer to pain
River runs where all rivers go
This desire will not be contained
Yes we all want to be your next lover
Yes we all want to be your next lover
Lover
Lover
I love her
Who are you dreaming of now
Is she flesh real
Or carved in memoryEmbed
