Seven LyricsBlow me away
Was that love you declared
Only a word
Love can mean anything
Understand the world we're living in
Oceans apart
What's that view from your wave
Beautiful craft
Weather and change
Understand the world we're living in
Love can mean anything
God made love to me
Soothed away my gravity
Made me a pair of angel's wings
Clear vision and some magic things
God is love to me
Thank you for those things
Understand the world we're living in
Love can mean anything
Darling
I'm open
Unguarded
Unbroken
Now we've done our time
We can drift away
Like the heavy cloud
With the weight of rain
Understand the world we're living in
Love can mean anything
Understand the world we're living in
Love can change anythingEmbed
