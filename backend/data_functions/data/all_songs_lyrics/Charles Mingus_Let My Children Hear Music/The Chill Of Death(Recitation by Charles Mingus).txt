The Chill Of Death(Recitation by Charles Mingus) LyricsThe chill of death, as she clutched my hand.
I knew she was coming, so I stood like a man.
She drew up closer, close enough for me to look into her face and I began to wonder, "hadn’t I seen her some other place?"
She beckoned me to come closer, as if to pay an old debt.
I knew what she wanted; it wasn’t quite time yet.
She threw her arms about me, as many women had done before.
I heard her whisper, "you’ll never cheat me, never anymore."
Darkness and nothingness clouded my mind.
I began to realize death was nothing to fear, but something sweet and kind.
I pinched to see if I was dreaming but failed to find bodily form. I then began to realize death had worked her charm.
Taking myself of nothingness I chose a road to walk.
I noticed death’s pleasantness with no one to stop me to talk.
I remembered stories of heaven as I envisioned the glory ahead.
Two roads lay waiting for me to choose them now that I was dead.
One road was dark; I could not see clearly such its long stretched highway.
The other road was golden and glowing, and shined as bright as day.
And I did remember stories of pearly gates, golden streets...or how…however those stories were told.
I knew I’d reach heaven on this highway. If not, I’d have the gold.
I took one footstep feeling safe and acting bold.
Suddenly, I realized my mistake. My chosen road turned black, bitterly, and white cold.
No longer was it golden glory, nor heaven that it's in.
White hot flames were blazing; I saw the devil with his grin.
I had taken but one footstep so I turned to hurry back.
But there a sound more waited, not a door, nor a crack.
Finally coming to my sense, I walked on to my hell.
For long before death had called me, my end was planned.
Planned but well…1Embed
