Aphrodite LyricsI'm out in the desert, the desert's in here with me
To be here I came back, back is no place to be
The moon she serves to soothe me, the sun waits to remove me
To another place
I'm a pool in a stream, the sea is where I'm going to
Something tells me why I'm going is what I'm going through
Summer breeze caress me, a frozen road will best me
The night is long
I was a cry for help, loneliness was my back door
Come and go s you please 'cause I don't live there no more
Aphrodite, in your see-through nightie
I can see through you
I wish you were a garden, but you're not
So I'll leave you be
You threw the sunshine in my eyes, made it hard for me to see
Aphrodite, in your see-through nightie
I can see through you
It had to beEmbed
