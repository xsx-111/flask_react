Granma LyricsGranma, Granma
Is it really true that the sky is blue and you keep your teeth inside a jar?
Grandson, Grandson
I'm old up front and way behind but I ain't blind, I ain't blind
Granma, Granma
What's the use if I can't deduce who or how the hell you are?
Grandson, Grandson
I chained myself to the palace rail, months in jail ain't no fun
Granma, Granma
Then what's the good of losing blood, fighting in that bloody war?
Grandson, Grandson
I'm old up front and way behind but I ain't blind, I ain't blind
Granma, Granma
It's more 'n a shame all the same and I wish that I'd known my pa
Grandson, Grandson
It sure is true that the sky is blue and I keep my teeth inside a jarEmbed
