Officer Dan LyricsOfficer Dan
Do what you can
To patch up your life
Get back with your wife
Give up your badge
Get together with Madge
For she will turn you on
Ahon Ahon Ahon Ahon on on on
Officer Dan
You don't have a plan
You just have to think
And stop being a fink
Give up your badge
Get together with Madge
For she will turn you on
Ahon Ahon Ahon Ahon on on onEmbed
