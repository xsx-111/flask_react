Refugee LyricsThe promise was a word - the word was fine
Fine became a line - too fine to take it easy
Easy was food - food was warm
Warm became a weapon behind a locked door - with the cold turned on
Then the word was a lie
Turned Yellow - Fell down - Turned brown - Turned black - Black became a place nobody want to go
They carried a star
Star was gold - pickled in a jar
Jar became a grave
Grave turned cold - with the heat turned on - they burned like coal
Coal was red - The red were dead
The dead became a legend
The rest left home
Home became a body around their bonesEmbed
