Psychopath: A) The Psychopath B) Is For Butterflies LyricsPart I: The Psychopath
I planted my sugar in the dark hills where we walked as a boy of thirteen
Trapped on briars in the dark mills trying to bury that woman
Hid in a wood, tried to be good, was hidden by a friendly tree
My dream, my dream, you should have heard her scream
Insisting she should know
The way the madman goes
Take me, she said, break me, she said, turn my head, churn me dead
Let's do it like a madman would
Didn't think I should it, didn't think I could it
Nor would it
I did it
I did it and dug it
She tripped, I flipped
Was flauntin', was tauntin'
My dream, my dream, you should have heard her scream
Her face just had to be seen
Carry body 'cross quiet night, where we want to take a look at my dream
She'd seen it, been it
Paid the price and there she lies
Part II: Is for butterflies
The psychopath met a little girl, maybe yours, and this is what happened and whyEmbed
