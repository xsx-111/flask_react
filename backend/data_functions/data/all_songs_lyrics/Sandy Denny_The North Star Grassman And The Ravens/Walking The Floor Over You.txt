Walking The Floor Over You LyricsWell, you left me and you went away
You said that you'd be back yesterday
You've broken your promise and you left me here alone
I don't know why you did it babe, but I do know that you're gone
Well I'm walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink, you know it's true
Hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Well I'm walking the floor over you
Well someday you may be lonesome too
Walking the floor is good for you
When your feet start walking and it won't hurt you to try
Remember that I love you babe and I will till the day I die
Walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink you know it's true
Hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink you know it's true
Hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink you know it's true
Hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over you
Well I'm walking, walking the floor over you
I can't sleep a wink you know it's true
Hoping and I'm praying as my heart breaks right in two
Walking the floor over youEmbed
