If You Saw Thru My Eyes LyricsLord above us, hear my song
Tell me if I'm doing wrong
I'm just a man and not like you
If you saw thru my eyes what would you do?
A simple life that's what I feel
To want to sing it's not unreal
So lord in heaven, let me know
If you saw thru my eyes where would you go?
I take the blame for where I've been
On all the ones I've had to lean
And now I've shared it all with you
If you saw thru my eyes what would you do?Embed
