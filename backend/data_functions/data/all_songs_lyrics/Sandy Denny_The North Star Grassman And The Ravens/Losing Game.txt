Losing Game LyricsI love you darlin' but you don't love me
Might as well face it and est you free
I've been playing a losing game
In spite of this I'm not ashamed
I gave you my love and I have no regrets
I'm true to you baby with love and respect
I stood by you when no one else would
And I gave you everything that I possibly could
I'm sitting here my hopes so high
Never been a day pass when I didn't cry
People are talking all over town
Keep telling me that I should put you down
Oh, from your lips sweet honey pours
That is where all my love goes
I shouldn't have put my hopes so high
Never been a day when I didn't cry, ohEmbed
