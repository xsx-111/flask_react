Wretched Wilbur LyricsThe summer was the reason
Why it took so long to see
That even if I do possess
Some seeds of honesty
There is no garden
So how come I have no land?
I shall be waiting here awhile
To see what comes to hand
Misers mise and compromise;
I know what I have seen
The wanderers are in the east;
That's where I should have been
But I did not go there;
I couldn't find the way
I do believe I made a try
But I really couldn't say
Oh, that wretched Wilbur
He keeps ploughing up the land
He fights the battle thoughtfully
With roses in his hands
But where is the fight now?
So play us your merry song
The autumn, it has blown away
And the winter, it is longEmbed
