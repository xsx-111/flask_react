Service and Repair LyricsOn the outskirts of expansion, looking out from Blueprint peak
The flow is flooding of urban settlers panning through rivers running dry
Numbers roll on in, smiling a lottery grin, a sadness blurs the eye...
It's just a matter of time in they're moving on
It's just a matter of time before they're moving on
Doesn't take much time for plans to go wrong
And chase another ghost of a chance
In the shadow of chain-store ghost towns
Where no one walks the streets at night
The silent nation hooked on medication
Stares into a blue flickering light
The young drift off alone
And the old are whisked away
And prospects keep looking up
But the line is getting long on the lost highway
The line's getting longer on the lost highway
Doesn't take much time for plans to go astray
And chase another ghost of a chance
They say deep down inside, lie properties of a healing
Kind
If so it'd better come around soon
And do a little bit of service and repair
Do a little bit of service and repair
Do a little more service and repair
Doesn't take much time for plans to change
And offer up another chance
For a little bit more service and repair
Do a little bit more service and repair
Doesn't take much time for plans to change
And offer up another chance
At sewing the dream better suited for both soul and
