The Secret Life of Arabia Lyrics
The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets, never seen
Secret secrets, evergreen

I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes at the cross fades

Secret secrets, never seen
Secret secrets, evergreen
The secret life of Arabia
Never here, never seen
Secret life, evergreen
The secret life of Arabia

You must see the movie, the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song when the heroine dies

Arabia
Secret, secret
Arabia
Secret, secret
Arabia
Secret, secret
The secret life of Arabia
Never here, never seen
Secret life, evergreen2Embed
