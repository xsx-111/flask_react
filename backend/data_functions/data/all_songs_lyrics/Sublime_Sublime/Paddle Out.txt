Paddle Out Lyrics
I never thought that when I grew up I would be in a band
And travel all the best spots in the land
And I'm not here to brag or boast
I'm here to tell you about the spots that I love the most

Natural Bridges on a clean west swell
Breaks over the reef like a bat out of hell
Stockton Avenue gets hollow and mean
And on a big day, it works like a machine
Outside Stockton gets hot like a glove
Swift Street, John Street, into Mitchell's cove
Big Steamer Lane makes you wish you were a trout
When it's smackin' so hard, only two dudes paddle out

A huge summertime south swell hits when I'm in my hometown
On a surf side bowl is where I can be found
Up and down the coast
Checkin' out the spots that I love the most2Embed
