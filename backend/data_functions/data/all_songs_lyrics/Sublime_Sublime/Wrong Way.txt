Wrong Way Lyrics
Annie's twelve years old, in two more, she'll be a whore
Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way
Don't be afraid
With the quickness, you get laid
For your family, get paid
It's the wrong way

I gave her all that I had to give
I'm gonna make it hard to live
Salty tears running down to her chin
And it ruins up her makeup
And never wan' give
A cigarette pressed between her lips
But I'm staring at her tits, it's the wrong way
Strong if I can, but I am only a man
So I take her to the can
It's the wrong way

The only family that she's ever had
Is her seven horny brothers and a drunk ass dad
He needed money, so he put her on the street
Everything was going fine, until the day she met me
Happy are you sad, wanna shoot your dad?
I'll do anything I can, the wrong way
We talk all night, tried to make it right
Believe me, shit was tight
It was the wrong way
Don't run away, if you wanna stay
Cause I ain't here to make you, oh, no
It's up to you what you really want to do
Spend some time in America
Dub style!


She'll give you all that she's got to give
But I'm gonna make it hard to live
Big, salty tears rolling down to her chin
And it smears up her makeup
An' never wan' give
So, we ran away
And I'm sorry when I say that straight to this very day
It was the wrong way
She did the hike, don't matter if I like it, or not
Because she only wants the wrong way
I gave her all that I had to give
She still wouldn't take it, whoa, no
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve
And it still ruins her makeup, and never wan' give17Embed
