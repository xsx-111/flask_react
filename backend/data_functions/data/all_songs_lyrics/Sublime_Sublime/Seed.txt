Seed Lyrics
Janie always said I was a mess
I'm sorry 'bout that mess
I made her bleed
Budda-by-by-by-by
I'm planting my seed
Still, I knew she could take it
If I opened up to people
If I knew it could make it
But I hope her parents love her so
Be oh yes, bein' on that plane
If I got that brain
I made her bleed
Yeah, she wanted love in the scene
Well, if you're livin', wanna give or get old
And if you never knew that we get old
You live it up, you live it up, you get old
Believe, believe, people, then I say
That every people that's the same thing everyday

Well, if you gotta know my place
And if you get sit back, you in your face, but
I know her parents love her
And I hope her parents love her
I hope her parents love her so


Billyed back in 1983
What did you do for me?
I made her bleed
For lie lovin', I planted my seed
But
I knew we could make it
But, I only knew that the bitch would break it, yeah
I hope her parents love her so
My God, don't look at me
If he had to go

I know I felt real love and my hole it bleed
You never knew punishment's what he needs
Oh my god, Vasoline
Believe it or not, get the disease
I, I hope her parents love her
I hope her parents love her so7Embed
