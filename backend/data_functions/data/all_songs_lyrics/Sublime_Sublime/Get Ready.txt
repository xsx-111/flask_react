Get Ready LyricsAlright
Come on

Some folks say that smokin' herb is a crime
If they catch you smokin', they're bound to drop the dime
Insufferable, informer crazy fools
Wait, with their fingers crossed, for you to break the rules
And in the evening, we try to jam
We like our music loud, in this here band
We let the bass line drop as loud as we can stand
Somebody always gotta turn informer for the man
I want to know, know right now
Is it one of you in the crowd?
Are you gonna call 9-1-1, and spoil all of my fun?

You crazy fools

I'm in the mood, get ready
I'm in the mood
Come on now, yeah
I'm in the mood, are you ready?
I'm in the mood
Come on now, yeah
Come on an'
Load up the bong, crank up the song
Let the informer call 9-1-1
Load up the bong, crank up the song
Let the informer call 9-1-1
And when security police force g'won arrive
Don't try to run, don't try to hide
Just pull out the .9, pop in the clip
Puh, and let one slip

Into these crazy fools

I'm in the mood, get ready
I'm in the mood
Come on now, yeah
I'm in the mood, are you ready?
I'm in the mood
Come on now, yeah

And in the evenin', when we try to jam
We like the music loud, in this here band
Oh, I wanna know now
I want to know, know right now
Are you willing, are you willin' and able?
Oh, got the crazy fool

Some folks say that smoking herb is a crime
If they catch you smokin', they're bound to drop the dime
Insufferable, informer crazy fools
Wait, with their fingers crossed, for you to break the rules

But, I'm in the mood, get ready
I'm in the mood
Come on now, yeah
I'm in the mood, are you ready?
I'm in the mood
Come on now, yeah
I'm in the mood, get ready
I'm in the mood
Come on now4Embed
