Pawn Shop Lyrics
Down there at the pawn shop, it's the way-only way to shop
Down there at the pawn shop, if it's not in stone
Down there at the pawn shop, it no way, no way to shop
Down there at the pawn shop
What has been told
Albino made of stone
Just remember that it's flesh and bone

So, why I'm down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop
What has been sold
Not strictly made of stone
Just remember that it's flesh and bone

And I have heard
Light like a bird, yeah
But just remember that it's flesh and bone

So, why I'm down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop

Go!
Right!
Uh, that's right

Down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop
What has been sold
Not strictly made of stone
Just remember, it's flesh and bone
What has been sold
Not strictly soul
Please remember, it's flesh and bone
Why I'm down here at the pawn shop

Down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop
Down here at the pawn shop-yop-yop
