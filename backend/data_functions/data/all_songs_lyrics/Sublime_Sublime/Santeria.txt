Santeria Lyrics
I don't practice Santeria, I ain't got no crystal ball
Well, I had a million dollars, but I, I'd spend it all
If I could find that jaina and that Sancho that she's found
Well, I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd slap her down

What I really wanna know, ah, baby, mmm
What I really want to say, I can't define
Well, it's love that I need, oh
My soul will have to

Wait 'til I get back, find a jaina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break, feel the break, feel the break, and I got' live it up
Oh, yeah, huh, well, I swear that I

What I really wanna know, ah, baby
What I really want to say, I can't define
Got love, make it go
My soul will have to

Mmm, what I really wanna say, ah, baby
What I really wanna say is, "I've got mine
And I'll make it, yes, I'm comin' up"
Tell Sanchito that

If he knows what is good for him, he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new .45
And I won't think twice to stick that barrel straight down Sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I got something for his punk ass

What I really wanna know, my baby
Ooh, what I really wanna say is, "There's just one"
Way back, and I'll make it, yeah
My soul will have to wait

Yeah, yeah, yeah94Embed
