What I Got (Reprise) Lyrics
Early in the morning, rising to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I'll strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason, reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a Dalmatian, I can still get high
I can play the guitar like a motherfucking riot

Life is too short, so, love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over, or you might get shot
Never had to battle with my bullet-proof vest
Never start static, I get that off my chest
Take a small example, a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity-ty-ty-ty
Love's what I got within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It comes back to you, you gonna get what you deserve
Try and test that, you're bound to get served
Love's what I got, don't start a riot
You feel it when the dance gets hot, hot

Lovin' is what i got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what i got
I said, remember that
Well, I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Fucking and fighting, it's all the same
Livin' with Louie Dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me

Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
Lovin' is what I got
I said, remember that
I got, I got, I got, I gotEmbed
