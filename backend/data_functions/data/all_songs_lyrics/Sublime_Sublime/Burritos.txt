Burritos Lyrics
I don't want to go and party
I don't want to shoot the pier
I don't wanna take the doggy for a walk
I don't want to look at naked chicks and drink beer

I don't want to do a bong load
And go and wrench on the car
I don't want to hose the dog shit down
'Cause I ain't even gonna get out of bed

I ain't gettin'
I ain't gettin' out of bed, today
I ain't gettin'
I ain't gettin' out of bed, today

Keep on skankin', Ronnie
Skank the night away
But the time is coming for us all to pay, hey

I don't want to watch no porno
And I don't want to play guitar
I don't want to spank the monkey
I don't want to go down to the corner bar
And I ain't even gotta listen
To all the stupid shit you got to say
I don't want to do a god damn thing
I don't wanna, wanna leave my bed, today

I don't want
I don't wanna leave my bed, today
I don't want
I don't wanna leave my bed, today

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Keep on skankin', Ronnie
Skank the night away
But the time is coming for us all to pay


I don't wanna eat burritos
Or read about O.J. 
No, I don't want to get a head rush
'Cause I ain't even gettin' out of bed, today
I ain't gettin'
I ain't gettin' out of bed, today
I ain't gettin'
I ain't gettin' out of bed, today
I ain't got to leave my bed, today
No, no, no, no, no, no
No way, no way, no way
No
Way

Keep on skankin', Ronnie
Skank the night away
But the time is coming for us all to pay6Embed
