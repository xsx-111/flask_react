The List LyricsThere's a little room on my list for tonight
Will ya be the one to fill it in
Toss around what is up, what is down
In between, would ya like to dream
Step on in, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might
There's a little song on my list for tonight
Would ya like to try and make it rhyme
Sing and sway, if your heart feels that way
We can leave the blues behind
There's a little lovin' on my list for tonight
With a bit of luck, I'll check it off
Toss around what is up, what is down
In between, d' ya know what I mean
Rain, rain all day long
You've made it pay, you can do no wrong tonight
Pick and grin, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might
Thick and thin, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might
There's a little room on my list for tonight
Will ya be the one to fill it in
Toss around what is up, what is down
In between, would ya like to dream
Step on in, ya don't have to play to win
But then you might
Thick and thin, ya don't have to play to win
But then you mightEmbed
