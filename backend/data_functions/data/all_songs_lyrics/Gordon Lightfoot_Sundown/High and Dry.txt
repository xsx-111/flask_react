High and Dry Lyrics
With ladylike devotion, she sails the bitter ocean
If it wasn't for lovesick sailors
There'd be nothin' left but flotsam

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home
Before you're lyin, high and dry
I hope you find your way back home before you die

Her sails below like bubbles
While you sip your daily doubles
If she wasn't so fond of the weather
She might give the deckhands trouble

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home
Before you're lyin, high and dry
I hope you find your way back home before you die

One day when I grew older
I found I could not hold her
She took on a fine young skipper
Who soon ran her up on a boulder
Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home
Before you're lyin, high and dry
I hope you find your way back home before you die

Now the pleasures of the harbor
Don't include a lady barber
If it wasn't for Long John Silver
All of us pirates would've been martyrs

Singin' why, me oh my, is there a better man than I?
I hope you find your way back home
Before you're lyin, high and dry
I hope you find your way back home
Before you're lyin, high and dry
I hope you find your way back home before you dieEmbed
