Catherine Wheels LyricsNo night to stay in
Bad moon is rising again
Dice rolls
And you burn
Come down I fear
As that cold wheel turns
I know what I know
Sad Claude's been sleeping around
To stroke the right nerve
Whose needs do I serve?
As Catherine's wheel turns
She was always the first to say gone
She's got her Catherine wheels on
Always the first to say gone
Go kindly with him
To his blind apparition
Whose face creases up
With age gone grey
He'll back here one day
She was always the first to say gone
She's got her Catherine wheels on
Always the first to say gone
She's got her Catherine wheels on
Wheels on
Catherine wheels
Catherine wheels
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
She's gone
Vanished in the night
Broke off the logic of light
He woke
Tore the covers back
Found he was empty inside
So they were told
When the moon would rise
The best time to leave with your soul
She's gone
But towards the light
Watching her whole life unfold
Oh, bruises come out dark
So strong was his hold on her
Regarded by some as his slave
He spoke as in a stranger's tongue
Despair us and drive you away
Oh, bruises come out darkEmbed
