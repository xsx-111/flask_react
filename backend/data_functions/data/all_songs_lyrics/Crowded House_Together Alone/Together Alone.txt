Together Alone LyricsTogether alone
Above and beneath
We were as close
As anyone can be
Now you are gone
Far away from me
As is once, will always be
Together alone
Anei ra maua
E piri tahi nei
E noha tahi nei
Ko maua anake
Kei runga a Rangi
Ko papa kei raro
E mau tonu nei
Kia mau tonu ra
Together alone
Shallow and deep
Holding our breath
Paying death no heed
I'm still your friend
When you are in need
As is once, will always be
Earth and sky
Moon and sea
Anei ra maua
E piri tahi nei
E noha tahi nei
Ko maua anake
Kei runga a Rangi
Ko papa kei raro
E mau tonu nei
Kia mau tonu raEmbed
