Pineapple Head Lyrics
Detective is flat
No longer is always flat out
Got the number of the getaway car
Didn't get very far

As lucid as hell
These images moving so fast
Like a fever
So close to the bone
I don't feel too well

And if you choose
To take that path
I will play you like a shark
And I'll clutch at your heart
I'll come flying like a spark
To enflame you

Sleeping alone
For pleasure, the pineapple head
It spins and it spins
Like a number I hold
Don't remember if she was my friend
It was a long time ago
And if you choose
To take that path
I will play you like a shark
And I'll clutch at your heart
I'll come flying like a spark
To enflame you

Sleeping alone
For pleasure, the pineapple head
It spins and it spins
Like a number I hold
Don't remember if she was my friend
It was a long time ago

And if you choose
To take that path
Would you come to make me pay?

I will play you like a shark
And I'll clutch at your heart
I'll come flying like a spark
To enflame you
I will clutch at your heart
And come flying like a spark
To enflame you, ah!Embed
