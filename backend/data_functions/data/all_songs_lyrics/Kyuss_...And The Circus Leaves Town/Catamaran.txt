Catamaran Lyrics
Smooth stones beneath me
Cool air surrounds
Soft and savoury
You can take me to God
You can take me to God

No, it doesn't take your will
To set your brace on me
I never doubt your possibilities
Please let go of my sleeve

Smooth stones behind me
Cold air surrounds
Soft and savoury
You can take me to God
You can take me to God

No, it doesn't take your will
To set your brace on me
I never doubt your possibilities
Please let go of my sleeveEmbed
