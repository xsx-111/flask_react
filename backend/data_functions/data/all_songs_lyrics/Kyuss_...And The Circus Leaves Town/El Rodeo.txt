El Rodeo Lyrics
Johnny
And if you're trying to ride for free
Oh Johnny
It would be the same I'll do to you

Johnny
And if you wanna try my needs
Johnny
It would be the same I'll do to you

Johnny
And if you're trying to ride for free
Oh Johnny
It would be the same I'll do to you

Johnny
And if you wanna try my needs
Johnny
It would be the same I'll do to you

Johnny
And if you're trying to ride for free
Johnny
It would be the same I'll do to you
Rodeo
Johnny
Rodeo
And if you're trying to ride for free
Rodeo

Rodeo
Rodeo
