Size Queen Lyrics
So clean, so blue and it's so deep
Shallow
Refreshing bowl and it's so clear
Shallow
Best thing I've seen in my whole life
Shallow
You must return me to your beach
Shallow

So I dive, inches to the ground
Now alright
Inches to the ground

So clean, so blue and it's so deep
Shallow
Refreshing bowl and it's so clear
Shallow
Best thing I've seen in my whole life
Shallow
You must return me to your beach
Shallow

So I dive, inches to the ground
Now alright
Inches to the ground
So I dive, inches to the ground
YeahEmbed
