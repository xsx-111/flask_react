Tangy Zizzle Lyrics
Yeah, yeah put it in gear, baby
Hell yeah, that's what I like about you, baby, you're always on time!

Wherever you go, is where I go
Whatever you say, keep it running
When the wind blows, when the sky breaks
Hold your eyes in, and believe it

Where you want me to be?
Where you want me to be?
Where you want me to be?
Where you want me to be?

In the morning, when it's raining
I couldn't believe it, no complaining
Fuck the others, fuck the teacher
They'll never know this, is he crazy?

Where you want me to be?
Where you want me to be?
Where you want me to be?
Where you want me to be?Embed
