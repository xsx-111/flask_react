Spaceship Landing Lyrics
You've been in back of me (Yeah)
Feeling sent to me (Yeah)
I'm tired of the word
When my back ain't around here

No more you and me (Yeah)
No more listening (Yeah)
Tired of your word
All your words are so backwards

Being as lost as can be (Yeah)
Touch of purity (Yeah)
If you're gonna go now
Well I wanna go with you

Uh, oh
Uh, oh

Oh yeah, you're a fucked up man
With a fucked up plan
Oh yeah, you're a fucked up man
With a fucked up plan
Oh yeah, you're a fucked up man
With a fucked up plan
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Did I say too much?
You didn't want me to hear
Did I say too much?
I didn't want me to see here
Did I hate too much?
I'm not sure I should leave here
Did I hate too much?
I'm thinking someone should bleed here

Why the finger? it's all right
Me and you could, it's all right
Straighten me out, it's all right
Guiding light, it's all right
There you go, it's all right
Wait up and turn me in, it's all right
Help you out man, it's all right
Help me in, I just mightEmbed
