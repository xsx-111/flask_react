Wasted Lyrics
I'm coming down again, across the yellow moon
Our lives were disconnected much too soon
I understand that I'm not the one you need
But we're tied to the things that we can't control
And now it's washin' over me
I don't need to make you mine
I don't need to compromise
I don't need to magnify what's lost
And I don't wanna drag you in
To what you can't escape, my friend
I just wanna turn inside and feel

Yeah, the days fly by like a carousel of slides
I'm in a dream I can't escape
Got no place to run and hide
And I need your kiss
Like I'm dressed in morning mist
I get sucked into the theater
On a ridе I can't resist
Babe, I know it's getting latе
I don't wanna hesitate
Never meant to make you wait so long
'Cause you got to fight to win
You know I can't let go again
I just wanna turn inside and hear
You won't interfere
I'm not asking you, I'm returning
Wake me up when the lights go low
I'm just wasted, baby, lost and learning
Sometimes you just ain't good enough

You've been on my mind
The days, they move so slow
I'm just tired in a way that I can't explain
It's like I'm losing all control
I'm just laying there, my hands are cold
As we crossed another wind
I'm alive and I'm trying not to think too hard
About it coming back again
I just wanna learn to fly
Under these romantic skies
I don't need to compromise our love
But I'm about to drag you in
And no, you can't go home again
I just wanna learn, in time, to heal

I'm not asking you, I'm returning
Wake me up when the lights go low
I'm just wasted, baby, lost and learning
Sometimes you just ain't good enough
I just wanna learn to turn it off and
I just wanna learn to turn
Um, let's do that againEmbed
