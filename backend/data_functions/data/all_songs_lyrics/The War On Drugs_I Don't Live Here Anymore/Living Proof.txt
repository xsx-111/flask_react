Living Proof Lyrics
Banging on a drum
You turned me loose
Maybe I'm the living proof
What have I been running from?

I went down to the corner
They're building up my block
Maybe I've been gone too long
I can't go back
Oh, lonesome
I will protect
I'll keep improving
Taking me home
I'm always changing
Now I suppose
I'm only moving
I'm in Chicago
Come to me now
I know the path
I know it's changing
I know the pain
The pain you've been feeling
I've been to the place
That you've tried escaping
I can't recall
What I believe in
I'm always changing
Love overflowing
But I'm rising
And I'm damaged
Oh, rising
