Victim Lyrics
I surrender, baby, help me understand
I've given everything when I had to give
Maybe I'm a victim of my own desire
I can't change it, mm, yeah

I remember walking through the fields of glass
I remember darkness overhead
Honey, I'm a victim of my own desire
I can't change it, mm, yeah
Should I keep moving?

But you took it all, and you threw it all away
Never wanted nothing I had to give
Honey, I'm a victim of my own desire
Who are ya?

I remember looking through the photographs
I kept waiting, but some things never change
Honey, I'm a victim of my own desire
I keep changing you, ooh, yeah

Maybe stop pretending you need to be somewhere
'Cause I'll keep chasing everything through the dark
Honey, I'm a victim of my own desire
But I keep changing, yeah, ooh, yeah
Should I keep moving? Yeah, mm
Honey, I'm a victim of my own desire
Never mind the darkness overhead
When you feel alone, do you really feel alive?
Who are ya?
Yeah, I took it all, but I threw it all away
Never wanted nothing you had to give
Honey, I'm a victim of my own desire
Who are ya?

Who are ya?
Who are ya?
Who are ya?
Who are ya?
Who are ya, babe?
Who are ya?
Who are ya, babe?


Honey, I'm a victim of my own desire
Never mind the darkness overhead
When you feel alone, can you really feel alive?
Who are ya?
Yeah, I took it all, but I threw it all away
Never wanted nothing you had to give
Honey, I'm a victim of my own desire
Who are ya?
(Who are ya?) Who are ya, babe?
(Who are ya?) Who are ya, babe?
(Who are ya?) Who are ya, babe?
(Who are ya?) Who are ya, babe?
(Who are ya?) Who are ya, babe?Embed
