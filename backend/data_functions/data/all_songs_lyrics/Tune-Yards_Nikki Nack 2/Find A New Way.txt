Find A New Way LyricsFind a new way
My dreams aren't about the future
You tried to tell me that I had a right to sing
Just like a bird has to fly
And I wanted to believe him cause he seemed like
A really nice guy
Oh, but I trip on the truth when I walk that wire
When you wear a mask, always sound like a liar
I tried to tell him all the reasons that I had to never sing again
And he replied "You better find a new way"
Find a new way
Find a new way
Find it today
Find a new way
Don't need to look too hard, yeah
Somehow we find a new fine way
And now they say
"He come, he come, he come"
And your sleep is a frame of
He comes, shake 'em, tell'em
"Be unafraid"
And now they say
"Here come, here come, here come"
You and me, never free
Attached by bands
Are cutting off the blood to our hands
You and me are never free
You pull and I bend and I am ready for the end
Cause I've tried, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried
It's a dangerous ride
I'm never free
I bend 'til I break
And every bone is in stake
She tried to tell me that I had a right to scream
Just like a bird had to sing
And I believed her, but in truth
If you're convincing, I'll believe anything
I only speak when I'm feeling sad and lonely
But what I speak doesn't have to do with being sad and lonely
Little white lies
Erode my sight
When I look into his eyes so
Find a new way
Find a new way
Find a new way
Find it today
Find a new way
Don't need to look too hard, yeah
Somehow we find a new fine way
A sippy cup to keep a cap on all the screaming of songs
What happens when the drink is gone?
Nothing, stuffing down a stifled little yell
Desperation now, numb me at night
I pray to learn to pretend so I can sleep tight
But something doesn't feel right
When I see you changing
It makes me think that I could change too
Oh, change-o strange-o
'Nother rearrange-o
Oh, change-o strange-o
'Nother rearrange-o
When I see you changing
I believe that I could change too
Oh, change-o strange-o
'Nother rearrange-o
Oh, change-o strange-o
'Nother rearrange-o
Oh, change-o strange-o
'Nother rearrange-o
Oh, change-o (change-o change-o change-o...)
And now they say
"He come, he come, he come"
And your sleep is afraid
But we comes, shake come, tell' em
"Be unafraid" (Ha!)
And now they say
"He come, he come"
(Find a new way)
And now they say
(Find a new way)
"He come, he come, he come"
(Find a new way, find a new way)
But we come she come, tell' em
"Be unafraid"
(Find a new way)
And now they say
"He come, he come"2Embed
