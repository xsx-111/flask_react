Water Fountain Lyrics
No water in the water fountain
No side on the sidewalk
If you say Old Molly Hare, whatcha doin’ there?
Nothing much to do when you're going nowhere
Woohaw!
Woohaw!
Gotcha
We're gonna get the water from your house (your house)

No water in the water fountain
No wood in the woodstock
And you say old Molly Hare
Whatcha doin’ there?
Nothing much to do when you're going nowhere
Woohaw!
Woohaw!
Gotcha
We're gonna get the water from your house, your house

Nothing feels like dying like the drying of my skin and lawn
Why do we just sit here while they watch us wither til we’re gone?
I can't seem to feel it
I can't seem to feel it
I can’t seem to feel I’ll kneel
I’ll kneel, I’ll kneel the cold steel
You will ride the whip
You'll ride the crack
No use in fighting back
You'll sledge the hammer if there's no one else to take the flak
I can't seem to feel it
I can't seem to find it
Your fist clenched my neck
We're neck and neck and neck and neck and neck and
No water in the water fountain
No phone in the phone booth
And you say old Molly Hare
Whatcha doin’ there
Jump back, jump back
Daddy shot a bear
Woohaw!
Woohaw!
Gotcha
We're gonna get the water from your house, your house

I saved up all my pennies and I gave them to this special guy
When he had enough of them he bought himself a cherry pie
He gave me a dollar
A blood-soaked dollar
I cannot get the spot out but
It's okay it still works in the store
Greasy man come and dig my well
Life without your water is a burning hell
Serve me up with your home-grown rice
Anything make me shit nice
Se pou zanmi mwen, se pou zanmi mwen
And the two-pound chicken tastes better with friends
A two-pound chicken tastes better with two
And I know where to find you so
Listen to the words I said
Let it sink into your head
A vertigo round-and-round-and-round
Now I'm in your bed
How did I get ahead?
Whoop!
Thread your fingers through my hair
Fingers through my hair
Give me a dress
Give me a press
I give a thing a caress
Would-ja, would-ja, would-ja
Listen to the words I say!
Sound like a floral bouquet
A lyrical round-and-roundandroundandround
Okay
Take a picture it'll last all day, hey
Your fingers through my hair
Do it 'til you disappear
Gimme your head
Gimme your head
Off with his head!
Hey, hey, hey, hey
No water in the water fountain
Floral bouquet
A lyrical round-and-round-and-round-and-round
No side on the sidewalk
Take a picture it'll last all day, hey
And you say old Molly Hare, Hare
Nothing much to do when you're going nowhere
Woohaw!
Woohaw!
Gotcha, gotcha
We're gonna get the water from your house, your house
We're gonna get the water from your house, your house
We're gonna get the water from your house, your house16Embed
