Rocking Chair LyricsThe weight of me broke the rocking chair
Now I can't get to sleep
The weight of me broke the rocking chair
Now I can't get to sleep
The weight of me broke the rocking chair
Now I can't get to sleep
The weight of me broke the rocking chair
Now I can't get to bed
Oh how will I
(Rock) Rock me 
Rock me to sleep
Oh how will I
(Rock) Rock me 
Rock me to bed

The weight of me broke the rocking chair
Now I can't get to sleep
The weight of me broke the rocking chair
Now I can't get to sleep
The stink of me made the flowers dead
Now I can't get to sleep
The stink of me made the flowers dead
Now I can't get to bed
Oh how will I
(Rock) Rock me 
Rock me to sleep
How will I
(Rock) Rock me 
Rock me to bed

The weight of me broke the rocking chairEmbed
