Manchild Lyrics(When  cause I'm not sure)
Not gonna say yes when what I really mean is no
Not gonna say no unless you know I mean it

I mean it
Don't beat up on my body
I mean it
Don't beat up on my body

I've got something to say
Oh little manchild
Look at your pants
An accident happens each time we dance
Oh there were some times
Among the other times
When I could stand to do this little jig with you
Left right right left
It's time to meet it head on
I've got something to say

Not gonna say yes when what I really mean is no
Not gonna say no unless you know I mean it
I mean it
Don't beat up on my body
I mean it
Don't beat up on my body

I've got something to say
Oh little manchild
Look at your pants
I've got something to say
Happens each time we dance
I've got something to say
(Oh little manchild
Look at your pants)
I've got something to sayEmbed
