Stop That Man LyricsHe wanted what is mine
But I've paid too much
To let him walk away
Without the law's touch
A city too wrecked
To crack its own nuts
We'll have to be our own policemen
Please
Stop that man
Stop that man
Stop that man

So sick of watching idly like a weak man
I need it, the trigger in my own hand
A millisecond wiping out your crime
Crack-a-spine
It's mine, your life for the very first dime
All I ask is to be king of good in my neighbourhood
All I ask is to be right on top with the help of the cops
Riff raff, the neighbourhood's down
It sounds like we'll never get a glim-glam
Splish-splash, get my cash
Splish-splash, get my cash
Please
Stop that man
Stop that man
Stop that man

In the cab
Splish-splash, splish-splash
He wanted what is mine
Splish-splash, splish-splash
All I ask is to be king of good in my neighbourhood
All I ask is to be right up top with the help of the copsEmbed
