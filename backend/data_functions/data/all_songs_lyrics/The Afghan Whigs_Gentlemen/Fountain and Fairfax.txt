Fountain and Fairfax LyricsAngel, I'm sober
I got off that stuff
Just like you asked me to
Angel, come closer
So the stink of your lies
Sinks into my memory
She said, "Baby, forever
But I don't like to be alone
So don't stay away too long now"
Baby, forever
Well it's Tuesday now
I hear him breathin' inside of her
Let me drink, let me tie off
I'm really slobbering now
Let it stink, let it dry up
It's an impossible, how?
Angel, forever
Don't you promise me
What you cannot deliver now
Angel, together
I'll be waitin' for you
On Fountain and Fairfax
Let me drink, let me tie off
I'm really slobbering now
Let me stink, let it dry up
It's an impossible, how?
Let it stink
Let it dry up
Dry up
Dry upEmbed
