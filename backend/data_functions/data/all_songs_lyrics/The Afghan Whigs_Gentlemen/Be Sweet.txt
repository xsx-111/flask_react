Be Sweet LyricsLadies, let me tell you about myself
I got a dick for a brain
And my brain is gonna sell my ass to you
If I'm okay but in time I find I'm stuck
And she wants to love and I still wanna fuck
Now that I'm ashamed
It burns but the weight is off
Now that you're out of the way
I turn and I can walk
You showed no sympathy, my love
And this was no place for you and me to walk alone
On my grave, am I okay?
I am sure I am not
Ladies, let me tell you about my love
She kept giving me more
But it wasn't enough
So understand
Now that I come to you
To understand my little self
To understand my little self
Baby, you be sweet, be sweet, be sweet
Baby, you be sweet, be sweet, be sweet
Baby, you be sweet, be sweet, be sweet
Baby, you be sweet, be sweet, be sweetEmbed
