Now You Know LyricsSince you're aware of the consequences
I can pimp what's left of this wreck on you
Bit into a rotten one, now didn't you?
And they watch you chew, chew, chew
And they watch you chew, chew, chew
Chew it up
Did you have blinders on, my dear
Or were you just willing?
Or was I unaware of the damage a lie can do?
I thought you knew, knew, knew
I thought you knew, knew, knew
Listen up
Drive it off
Punctuate it with a smoker's cough
Light it up
Stick around
I told you somebody's going down now
Spit it up
Get it out
Let me kiss that beautiful mouth
Tell me is it the same?
My sweetness, my everything
And is this condescending a comfort at all to you?
Oh, we bit into a rotten one
Now didn't we?
Well, baby now it's through, through, through
Now it's through, through, through
Now it's through, through, through
Now it's throughEmbed
