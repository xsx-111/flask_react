I Keep Coming Back LyricsI wanna leave you
But I just can't leave you
I keep coming back for a little more of your love
I wanna go away, but honey, I just can't stay
I keep coming back for a little more of your love
And I can't understand when I try as hard as anyone can
Each night I dream, I wake up and scream
Aah baby, that I love you woman, I love you
Oh baby, I realise I treated you wrong
But I'm so sorry, let me come back were I belong
You see I'm your fool, I lost my cool
Ah baby, that I love you woman, I love you
And I wouldn't lie
Oh, but I lay down and die
Oh baby, that I love you woman
Oh baby, that I love you woman
That I love you woman
I love youEmbed
