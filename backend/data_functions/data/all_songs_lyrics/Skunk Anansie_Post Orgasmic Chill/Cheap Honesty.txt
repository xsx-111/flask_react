Cheap Honesty Lyrics
I know too well
I know these lines
I've seen them smothered in sleek ridicule
A seedy smile
They think they've scored
But I know morning comes and babe's alone again
Too alone again

So what can I do
With cheap honesty?
You're giving me more than I can see
But I'm too cool to say
That I want it all my way
Get blasted by this sincerity

I wish I had
The street's full view
These people screaming through their settled loves
So I pretend
So mellowed out
Too teasing, weak enough to long for
Home again
Lovely home again
So what can I do
With cheap honesty?
You're giving me more than I can see
But I'm too cool to say
That I want it all my way
Get blasted by this sincerity

So what can I do
With cheap honesty?
You're giving me more than I can see
But I'm too cool to say
That I want it all my way
Get blasted by this sincerity
So what can I do
With cheap honesty?
You're giving me more than I can see
But I'm too cool to say
That I want it all my way
Get blasted by this sincerity

Get blasted by this sincerity
Get blasted by this sincerityEmbed
