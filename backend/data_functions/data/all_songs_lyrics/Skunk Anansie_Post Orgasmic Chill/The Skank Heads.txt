The Skank Heads LyricsYou have seen me lie
You have seen me crucify respect
Seen redundant eyes
Seen the tension stagger to the mike
Made the bed too high
Have to slag on matey floors of sin
Slap the face too sane
See the face too wet as I
Deny - myself
Get off, get off me
Bet ya' posing hard
So secure a smacked up cuntie bitch
Now you're stuck for words
Scrambling for sarcastic wit
But I got that special knowledge
Of the crap that makes your skank
Head tick
All that brave you like
All that shirty pretense
You deny - yourselfEmbed
