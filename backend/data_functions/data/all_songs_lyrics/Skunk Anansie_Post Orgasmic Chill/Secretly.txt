Secretly LyricsI've been biding my time
Been so subtly kind
I've got to think so selfishly
'Cos you're the face inside of me
I've been biding my days
You see evidently it pays
I've been a friend with unbiased views
And then secretly lust after you
So now you feel lusty
You're bored and bemused
You wanna do someone else
So you should be by yourself
Instead of here with me
Secretly
Trying hard to think pure
Bloody hard when I'm raw
You're talking out so sexually
About boys and girls and your freakin' dreams
So now you feel lusty
You're hot and confused
You wanna do someone else
So you should be by yourself
Instead of here with me
Secretly
So now you've been busted
You're caught feeling used
You had to do someone else
You should have been by yourself
You had to do someone else
You should have been by yourself (by yourself)
Instead of here with me
Secretly
Secretly
