Charlie Big Potato LyricsI awake
From blood thick dreams
Washing blame
From my knees
Softly done
So secretly
I'm awake as Charlie sleeps
A lone brother
A lone sister
A home cover
Alone
I awake
Try to scream
Spit the vile breath
Till my tongue bleeds
Thinks it's all gone
Famously
Broke the hard girl
Good to please
A lone brother
A lone sister
A home cover
Alone
Tell it like it is
Tell it like it is
Tell the sordid truth
Tell them
Tell it like it is, tell them
A lone brother
A lone sister
A home cover, alone1Embed
