And This Is Nothing That I Thought I Had Lyrics
I've been there and your frigid wit was far too greasy
Ain't so slick, and it ain't so damn profound
I've been there, done that, grilling that was sadly sleazy
Ain't so scared of your cool, so underground

And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
With you
With you
With you

You've been here, and you reckon it was bubble lovie
Flirty babe, now your thing has run aground
Still bored here, watch your slithering is very waxy (Waxy)
Bass thumps clear, and your bitch won't make a sound

And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
With you
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
With you
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
And this is nothing that I thought I had
With you (With you)
With you (With you)
With you (With you)
With you (With you)
With you (With you)
With you (With you)
With you (With you)
With you (With you)Embed
