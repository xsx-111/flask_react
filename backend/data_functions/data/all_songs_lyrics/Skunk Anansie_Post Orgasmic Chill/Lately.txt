Lately LyricsSometimes all the moments
That we savoured for the last
Get crushed between the good and bad
From pressures we have had
But you know I can't conceive the day
When feelings run too high
To work out all the stale terrain
Emotions try to hide
When I try
Lately I can't seem to
Colour what we've lost
It all seems like bad means
When lovers turn from lust
Then I try
Try to smoke alone
These shattered ties with no compromise
Fall through this fragile hell
You see the drinks stay sipped
'Cos we've lost our grip
Too exhausted to rebel
When I try
Lately I can't seem to
Colour what we've lost
It all seems like bad means
When lovers turn from lust
Then I try
When I try
Lately I can't seem to
Colour what we've lost
It all seems like bad means
When lovers turn from lust
Lately I can't seem to
Colour what we've lost
It all seems like bad means
When lovers when lovers turn from lust
Then I try
Try to smoke aloneEmbed
