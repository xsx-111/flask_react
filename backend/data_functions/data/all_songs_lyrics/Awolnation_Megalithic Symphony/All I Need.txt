All I Need LyricsAll I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
It's early in the morning
I'm laughing at the sun
My mirror disappoints me, and
Am I the only one?
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is life, love, with you
I think I'm getting closer
But the scenery's the same
Am I a disappointment?
I'll blame it on the pain
It's all I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is life, love, with you
All I need is you
Is all I need
If you could simply believe
In me, and we would be forever together
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All all I need
All I need, all all I need
All I need, all all I need
Is you smiling at me
All I need is you
Is all I need
All I need is you
Is all I need
All I need is you
Is all I need
Is life, love, with you1Embed
