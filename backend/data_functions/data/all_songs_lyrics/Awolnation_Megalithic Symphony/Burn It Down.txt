Burn It Down Lyrics
If you're feeling like I feel then run your life like it's a dance floor
And if you need a little heat in your face, that's what I'm here for
If you're chilling in the dark and you're looking through a telescope
You will see me sipping on a soul of a new hope

So burn it down, burn it down
So burn it down, burn it down, yeah
So burn it down, burn it down, baby burn it burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down, baby burn it burn it down (x3)

If you're feeling like I feel throw your fist through the ceiling
Some people call it crazy well I call it healing
If you need love turn around, do the helicopter
If you're sick, baby girl I would love to be your doctor

Burn it down, burn it down, baby burn it (motherfucker) burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down, baby burn it burn it down (x2)
So burn it down

Looking through a window made of time, would you have the courage not to lie?
Looking down the barrel of today, would that make you turn around and stay?
Looking through a window made of time, would you have the courage not to lie?
Down
Burn it down
Hey, burn it down
Burn it down
So burn it down, burn it down baby burn it burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down baby burn it burn it down
Motherfucker, burn it down, burn it down baby burn it burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down baby burn it burn it down
Burn it down (x2)
So, burn it down
Burn it down, yeah
So, burn it down, burn it down baby burn it burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down, baby burn it (motherfucker) burn it down
Burn it down, burn it down, baby burn it burn it down (x2)
So burn it down5Embed
