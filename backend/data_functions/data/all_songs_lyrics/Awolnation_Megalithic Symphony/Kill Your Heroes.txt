Kill Your Heroes Lyrics
Well, I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
"Never let your fear decide your fate"

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know

Well, the sun one day will leave us all behind
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Well, I hate to be the one to ruin the night
Right before your, right before your eyes

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know
Well, I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
"Never let your fear decide your fate"

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know

I say you kill your heroes and
Fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause
Everybody will die
Every day we just
Go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we
Love you more than you know22Embed
