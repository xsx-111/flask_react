Swinging from the Castles LyricsI know, I know, I know
Ok?
I'll just do it later
What do you mean?
When I'm done
Don't forget
Uh, yeah
The kids are
The kids are blowing up the castles
We're trading
Love
And freedom, baby for our hassles
It's not for
Free
It's only free for our survival
The kids are
The kids are swinging from the castles
Swing
Swing
They're swinging from the castles
A tomahawk and a fleet fox
Uproot it please
And let me see the nearest parks
This hit missed
And a karate kid
A remix
This is the end of original content
The kids are
The kids are blowing up the castles
We're trading
Love
And freedom, baby for our hassles
It's not for
Free
It's only free for our survival
The kids are
The kids are swinging from the castles
Swing
Swing
They're swinging from the castles
Holy fires
And mystical minds
The martyrdom dumb dummies
Frequent flyer, go-byers
I cry out
Came, punched April out
Know what version did you get
But the sucker's in the south
The kids are
The kids are blowing up the castles
We're trading
Love
And freedom, baby for our hassles
It's not for
Free
It's only free for our survival
The kids are
The kids are swinging from the castles
Swing
Swing
They're swinging from the castles
Please please
Make the dirty preacher freeze
Please please
Make that dirty preacher freeze
Please please
Let that dirty preacher freeze
Jesus, wrote my lyrical outro with the greatest of ease
Ease, ease, ease, ease
The kids are
The kids are blowing up the castles
We're trading
Love
And freedom, baby for our hassles
It's not for
Free
It's only free for our survival
The kids are
The kids are swinging from the castles
Swing
Swing
They're swinging from the castles
We're trading
Love
And freedom, baby for our hassles
It's not for
Free
It's only free for our survival
The kids are
The kids are swinging from the castles
Swing
Swing
They're swinging from the castles
Swing
Swing
They're swinging from the castles
Love
