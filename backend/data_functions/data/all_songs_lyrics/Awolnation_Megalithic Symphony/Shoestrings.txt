Shoestrings LyricsGotta keep it movin'
Ya know I feel responsible
Ever since I met you
I noticed I'm invincible
I know you like it groovy
You know I'm bored with rock and roll (whoo)
Now that I'm improvin' (yeah)
They say that I have lost it all (oooh)
We're hanging by the shoestrings
The ones we love are holding
We're skin and bones
And blue blood
It's where we're going
Not where we came from
I have your attention
Cause anything is possible
I swear that my intention
Is nothing short of probable
You think that I'm conceited
But maybe I'm just miserable
Now that I'm improving
They say that I have lost it all
We're hanging by the shoestrings
The ones we love are holding
We're skin and bones
And blue blood
It's where we're going
Not where we came from
The ones that we love
Are the ones that we hurt
I said the ones that we love
Are the ones that we hurt
I said the ones that we love
Are the ones that we hurt
The ones that we love
Are the ones that we hurt
We're hanging by the shoestrings
The ones we love are holding
We're skin and bones
And blue blood
It's where we're going
Not where we came from
We're hanging by the shoestrings
The ones we love are holding
We're skin and bones
And blue blood
It's where we're going
Not where we came fromEmbed
