Jump on My Shoulders LyricsThere's a mad man looking at you
And he wants to take your soul
There's a mad man with a mad plan
And he's dancing at your door. Oh
What to do, oooh
What to do
When the walls are built to crumble
There's a mad man with a mad plan
And he waits for us to stumble
Oooh, but our eyes are open
Yeah, they're really open
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
I say we rob from the rich
And blow down the door
On to the next
To dance with the poor
Jump on my shoulders
You can jump on my shoulders
We rob from the rich
And blow down the door
On to the next
To dance with the poor
Jump on my shoulders
You can jump on my shoulders
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
Everybody it's ok if
You're mad at what I'm saying
Make peace, baby shake my hand cuz
I'm pretty sure I'm staying. Oh
What to do, ooooh
Look at you, when the walls begin
To crumble
It's a mad man with a mad plan
And he waits for us to stumble
Oooh, but our eyes are open
Yeah, they're really open
(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
I say we rob from the rich
And blow down the door
On to the next
To dance with the poor
Jump on my shoulders
You can jump on my shoulders
We rob from the rich
And blow down the door
On to the next
To dance with the poor
Jump on my shoulders
You can jump on my shoulders
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
I'll say the devils lost control
Live in the water
I'm scared of the city
Stay in the water
I'm scared of the city
Live in the water
I'm scared of the city
I'm scared of the city
Live in the water
I'm scared of the city
I'll pray for you
I say we rob from the rich
And blow down the door
On to the next
To dance with the poor
Jump on my shoulders
You can jump on my shoulders
We rob from the rich
And blow down the door
On to the next
To dance with the poor
Jump on my shoulders
You can jump on my shoulders
Seriously...It's not supposed to be easy...
That's why it feels so fucking good
Jump on my shoulders, yeah6Embed
