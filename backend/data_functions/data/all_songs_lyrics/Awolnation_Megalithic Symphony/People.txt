People Lyrics
Thank you
For listening again
Or for the first time
Or for the last time
We share this moment
And I am grateful for this

I was born to rage
For my fathers pain
With my brothers style
For my mothers reign
We could use some hope
We must learn to cope

So be good with goodbyes
So be good with goodbyes
Alright now

People, people
Have you heard the good news
There's people, people
They're running just like you
Today, I say
It's all that matters for now
For you
And I
Wooo
So people, people
Make some good ol' love
Well I lost my pride
With this body of mine
In another land
I began to understand
I got love for all your hate
I got lost to find my way

So be good with goodbyes
So be good with goodbyes
Yeah
Alright now

People, people
Have you heard the good news
There's people, people
They're running just like you
Today, I say
It's all that matters for now
For you
And I
Wooo
So people, people
Make some good ol' love
My knife is a dream
It's a beautiful world
She'll never leave
It's a beautiful world
Her body sits tight
When she's hitchin' a ride
Hey man I'm sorry
I'm not lookin' to fight

We were born to rage
We're the price of pain
We're a single voice
We're the second choice
We were born to rage

People, people
Have you heard the good news
There's people, people
They're running just like you
Today, I say
It's all that matters for now
For you
And I
Wooo
So people, people
Make some good ol' love
Oh na na na
Ho na na na
Ho na na na
Make some good ol' love
Oh na na na
Ho na na na
Ho na na na
Make some good ol' love
Oh na na na
Ho na na na
Ho na na na
