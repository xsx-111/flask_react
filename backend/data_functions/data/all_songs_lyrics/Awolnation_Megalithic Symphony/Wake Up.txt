Wake Up Lyrics(Wake up)
(Wake up) Well it's nice to meet you
Do you have a name, cause I would like to teach you, baby
(Alright) If it's unfamiliar
When the sharks are swimming we will watch them kill you, baby
(Yeah you) I'm a little shocked
Cause I can see the future looking through your eyes
(Tonight) Don't you fall asleep
Don't you fall.. it's only gonna take a little time
(Before we start to lose our minds)
We're leaving all the haters behind
(Before the sun decides to hide)
I know you think I'm maybe out of line
(I'm scared to love what we love most)
It's only gonna take a little time
(Before we start to lose our minds)
Wake. Up
(Wake up) Well it's nice to know you
Have you learned to fly, cause I would die to show you, baby
(Alright) If it's unfamiliar
When I taste your face then I can break the mirror, baby
(Yeah you) I'm afraid to hide
Cause I can live today before I say goodbye
(Tonight) Don't you fall asleep
Don't you fall.. it's only gonna take a little time
(Before we start to lose our minds)
We're leaving all the haters behind
(Before the sun decides to hide)
I know you think I'm maybe out of line
(I'm scared to love what we love most)
It's only gonna take a little time
(Before we start to lose our minds)
Wake. Up
Take some time to breathe
Let's take some time to breathe
From the desert to the sea
It's the same for you and me
When you say you'd rather bleed
Is that really what you're thinking
Let's take some time to breathe
Out, yeah.. it's only gonna take a little time
(Before we start to lose our minds)
We're leaving all the haters behind
(Before the sun decides to hide)
I know you think I'm maybe out of line
(I'm scared to love what we love most)
It's only gonna take a little time
(Before we start to lose our minds)
