Not Your Fault LyricsShe was built with a brain and some swagger
A little scream, little cry, little laughter
She's a ten, I'm a joke in my own mind
But she still loves to dance with my punch lines
This love found us
Now I see it
This love up down
Please believe
Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
Yeah, and
Baby cuz I'm crazy for you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
Yeah, and
Maybe I'm a little confused
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
Yeah, and
Baby, it's the wonderful news
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
Oh, it's not that you should care
I just wanted you to know
I'm a fight with myself till I'm bleeding
Just a taste of your skin start the healing
Anyone from my past get your ammo
Find my sun in the dark side of my shadow, yeah
This love found us
Now I see it
This love up down
Please believe
Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
Yeah, and
Baby cuz I'm crazy for you
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
Yeah, and
Maybe I'm a little confused
It's not your fault
It's not your fault
Yeah, and
Baby, it's the wonderful news
It's not your fault
It's not your fault, yeah
Oh, it's not that you should care
I just wanted you to know
