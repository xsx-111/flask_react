Soul Wars Lyrics
Yeah! Uh!
1, 2, 3, do you love me?
Watch me scream, burning on the trees
In amazement, ‘cause I'm on fire

You know?
4, 5, 6, show ya all my tricks
Fee Fi Fo, A giant’s at the door
In amazement, ‘cause I'm on fire

Ooh (Ooh)
Ooh (Ooh)
Cause I'm on fire

Can I get an amen?
For all the bleeding and the prayin'?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it, we can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it, you can taste it
Taste the smoke
Taste the smoke

Taste the smoke, this is no joke
Fifteen years, blood, sweat, and tears
And amazement, 'cause I'm on fire

It's a cruel, cruel world, for good boys and girls
A hot day in heaven, 5, 6, and 7
And amazement, ‘cause I’m on fire

With no hope from the devil

Can I get an amen?
For all the bleeding and the prayin'?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it, we can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it, you can taste it
It'll be OK, baby
Oo-Ha
Oo-Ha
Oo-Ha
Oo-Ha
We don't run, run, run
We don't run, run, run

Can I get an amen?
For all the bleeding and the prayin'?
I had to struggle to be gracious
Now we can touch it, we can taste it
Can I get a little amen?
No more running from the hangman
Now I'm the pilot of this spaceship
So you can touch it, you can taste it

We don't run, run, run
We don't run, run, run

Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah
