Some Sort of Creature LyricsI just saw a sort of gypsy, hippy lady
With her daughter
And uh
They were both carrying some sort of, like rodent
That had a tail
That looked like wooden
So I thought they were carrying wood
But it turns out it was some sort of like creature
And I have no idea what it was
It really blew my mindEmbed
