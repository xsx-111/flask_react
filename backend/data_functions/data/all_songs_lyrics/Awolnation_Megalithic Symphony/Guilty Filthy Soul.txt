Guilty Filthy Soul Lyrics
I'm running out of faith
Be careful who you tell
I'm running out of faith
Be careful who you tell

She's blackening my name
My army never came
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell

Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
Cause you got a guilty, filthy soul
Don't ya know it's out of your control?

She's blackening my name
I know you feel the same
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell
Stop squeezing on my neck
Your unemployment check
It's water under the bridge
Be careful who you tell
Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
Cause you got a guilty, filthy soul
Don't ya know it's out of your control?

Waiting on a blood line
You can find some free time
Look at who you're hating
Now you're celebrating
Waiting on a blood line
You can find some free time
Waiting on a blood line
Waiting on a blood line
Waiting on a blood line

She's blackening my name
Be careful who you tell

Cause you gotta look her in the eye
And you gotta love your way of life
Cause you got a guilty, filthy soul
Don't ya know it's out of your control?11Embed
