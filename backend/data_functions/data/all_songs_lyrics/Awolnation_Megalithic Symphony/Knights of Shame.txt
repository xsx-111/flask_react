Dance, baby, dance, like the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, like the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, ‘cause the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, like the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, like the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, ‘cause the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, like the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, like the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, ‘cause the world is ending
Dance, baby, dance, like the world is ending

This is who you are
This is who you are
This is who you are
This is who you are
This is who you are
This is who you are

Oh, oh
Sit back and look for the warnings
The future's bright and alarming
Sit back and look for the warnings
Sit back and look for the warnings
The future's bright and alarming
Sit back and look for the warnings

Cool
Woo
Huh
Cool
Oh

Baby, walking around with your head cut off
Baby, walking around with your head cut off
Uh, baby, walking around with your head cut off
Baby, walking around with your head cut off

Their power’s fear and it surrounds me
Their signs, you can see
One day we will wake the walking zombies
‘Til then we pray, ooh
Everybody
Everybody
The king and his ghost are laughing at me
These signs, you can see
One day we will listen for the sirens
'Til then we pray

Skeletons
Marching army
Guns
Drop your feet
I'm scared
I'm Duke Ellington
My mother said there'd be days like this
But one of the fires lit made her piss
Calling all zombies all up inside me
Transforming vampires right beside me
And you can't run
‘Cause you did, you'd be dead
And the walls can't roll from the side of my head
I beat the drool, my beats are cool
But here’s last kiss, all suckers they will cease to exist
I can't entertain what it'd be to be human
Lay waste to cities leave towns in ruin
I am a robot
Whole arsenal stock ready to blow
Lastly, you see me be 3 by 3
Firing these things called TNT
(Fire)
These things called TNT
These things called TNT
(Fire)
They call me TNT
These things called TNT

Aw, we can dance like the world's over
Yeah it's almost 2012, call your girls over
Let's kick back, pop shots, have a ball
And if the world blow up, next life we'll do it all over
Aw, yeah
Let's toast to the memory
I wrote my name in the sky so remember me
Baby, forever we
Together mentally
The day I leave my baby over something, then Hell'll freeze
Froze
This world Cole like Natalie
So
Let's lose our clothes like Adam, Eve
Back to the basics
Step out the Matrix
Step out your cool, baby, get on my spaceship
I seen her face lit
She seen the sign like a Mason
So we ran home like a base hit
Safe
Life is whatever you think it is
So what you think this is?

Yeah, it's all in your mind baby
You gotta do what you feel like a blind lady
You gotta spread your wings and just fly, baby
You feel like you're reborn? That's my baby
She say she feel it in her soul like a vibrator
I got some things for your thoughts we can try later
Let's hit the dance floor
Right before we outta time
And just party like it's 1999
You know what Prince said
Girl, you my princess
I got the glass slipper
I hope the thing fit
Your body on fire
Let me extinguish
Hop on this white horse
Ride to the sunset

Is anybody really out there breathin’
Is anybody really sick of bleeding
So come and scream into the sky this evening
It's full of women
I'm a choice you're feeling
Let's start today!
Let's start today!
Let's start today!
Let's start today!
Start today
Start today
Come on down

The Queen's Heart
The Knights of Shame
The people's voice
So we pray and we pray
The Queen's Heart
(Queen's Heart)
The Knights of Shame
(Knights of Shame)
So we pray and we pray
The Queen's Heart
The people's voice
So we pray and we pray
The Queen's Heart
The Knights of Shame
So we pray

And, yeah, it's no fun waiting for the fall
And there'll be no more waiting for you all
And there'll be one more chance for the truth
Without you, I would die
And, yeah, it's no fun waiting for the fall
And there'll be no more waiting for you all
And there'll be one more chance for the truth
Without you, I would die
Without you, I would die

Waiting on a heartbeat
Is anybody listening?
We’re waiting on a heartbeat
Can anybody hear me?
We’re waiting on a heartbeat
Is anybody listening?
We’re waiting on a heartbeat
Can anybody hear me?8Embed
