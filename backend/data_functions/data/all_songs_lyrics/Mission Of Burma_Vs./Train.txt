Train LyricsYeah, I'm ready
Making sense of all the hidden facts
Hit and run, that's the way it's made
Sick and tired of all Neanderthals?
Getting nowhere
Getting nowhere
Pretend to give a fuck
How can you pretend to give a fuck?
When nothing seems to matter at all
Across construction street
While the mental left to fornicate
We fly on this empty shell
We fly on this empty shell
Find another way
Show me, show me
Find another way
Show me, show me
Far away
So far away
When I think it's there
It's there in  the (?) (so far away)
When I think it's there
It's there in  the (?)
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry meEmbed
