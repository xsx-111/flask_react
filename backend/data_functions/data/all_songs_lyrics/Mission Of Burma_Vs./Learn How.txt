Learn How LyricsOh, every raw material at hand
Oh, remember all the things you said you'd do?
(?)
What happens next?
What happens now?
What happens next?
And the need for a book as far as I see
Conditioned by steps
One, two, three, four
Often seems that opportunity knocks
When the door is bolted, the door is locked
Door is bolted and the door is locked
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
The tools of the trade are the head and the heart
And the joke I know
And the joke I know
And the joke I know
What I will be when I grow up
If I grow up
When I grow up
Throw away the brainwash
Throw away the brainwash
Throw away the brainwash
And I give up
Don't give up
And I give up
Don't give up
(And I give up)
Don't give up
Don't give in
Learn how! (x4)
Every raw material at hand
Every raw material at hand
And then they're gone
Every raw material in your handEmbed
