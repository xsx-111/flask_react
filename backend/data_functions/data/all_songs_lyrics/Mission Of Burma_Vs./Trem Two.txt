Trem Two LyricsThe face at the window
The features I know
I try to escape but
The world is too slow
The question is big
The question is wide
I can't see around it
I see only one side
I hid from the heavens
The heaviest sleep
Deserve the unwanted
When love is so deep
Now I was touching you
The pleasures are past
And now there is only
The houses we pass
The dreams are all melting
Only to reform
Outside the heavens
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are rebornEmbed
