Laugh the World Away LyricsLaugh the world away
There's a bathroom
There's a voicebox
And a light bulb over my head
Laugh the world away
Everything is just as expected
No one thinks but they all talk
Laugh the world away
Well it seems like
I will never ever ever never ever never ever never ever ever take the chance again
Take the chance again
The chance (x10)
The
I can see the faces
Shining down with very (?)
And when I see them I can recall this
When I'm waking I feel
That's justice
That is justice
