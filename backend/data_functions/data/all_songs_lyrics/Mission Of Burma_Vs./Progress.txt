Progress LyricsDown with history
Down with sense
Nothing makes much difference
I'll surrender to this tragic mess
Spinning ball of randomness
Where logos is the finest blasphemy
Men's lives pass like strips of film
Recorded gestures, acts of will
I'd like to think that down through time
They'd compose a logical line
But chances are that's just a pile of shit
And I can't help but bow my head and cry
It took so long to finally realize
That all our hopes are based on such gross lies
Classroom lessons World War II
Atrocities against the Jews
Never again our solemn vow
That's why we all share Cambodia
Isn't it great how far we've come since then?
And I can't help but bow my head and cry
It took so long to finally realize
That all our hopes are based on such gross lies
Dialectic shit
Evolution's crap
Time and time again the masquerade is
Shown for what it really is
Progress, progress a pleasant myth
Progress a pleasant myth
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
That makes my life
