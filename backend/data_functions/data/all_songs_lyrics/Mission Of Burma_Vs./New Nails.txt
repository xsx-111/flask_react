New Nails LyricsDo a couple notes at the end
Singing after the first (maybe)
There was once a special book
It got changed by fascist crooks
(Save me please for I am weak)
There once was a great idea
Now they water it down to fizz
(Save me please for I am weak)
(Save me please for I'm a sheep)
Well, I suppose it's human nature
But when he said
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me, oh no
The Roman Empire never died
(Save me I am not a goat)
Just changed into the Catholic Church
(Dionysus has cloven hooves)
The Roman Empire never died
(Devil horns are not on me)
Save me I am not a goat
Ha ha ha ha
But when he said
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Plastic idols of me
Plaster idols of me, oh
Don't make an idol of me
He said
Well I walk the shores of Galilee
(Walk the shores of Galilee)
Where only the Spirit can talk to me
He said
Well I walk the shores of Galilee
On the desert sands and no one can touch me
(Don't touch me, no don't)
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
What's this?
All these crimes
Committed in my name
Oh, well
Guitar was so fuckin' loud in my headphones I couldn't tell whether I had the fuzz tone on or notEmbed
