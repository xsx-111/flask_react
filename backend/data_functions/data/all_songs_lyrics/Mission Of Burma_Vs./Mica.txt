Mica Lyrics(Anything was just total...)
First she says
Why mince words?
If you feel like a patient why not dress like one?
Then she says
Why can't I sleep?
Between icy wet white sheets for three days
And sink down deeper than dreams
Oh, I'd love that
I'd be a mineral deposit
A ball of mica inside a rock
I'd be a mineral deposit
A ball of mica inside a rock
Hey
Then there'd be no whistles, no radios
No screams
Then there'd be no whistles, no radios
No screams
First she says
Why mince words?
If you feel like a patient why not dress like one?
Then she says
Why can't I sleep?
Between icy wet white sheets for three days
And sink down deeper than dreams
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)Embed
