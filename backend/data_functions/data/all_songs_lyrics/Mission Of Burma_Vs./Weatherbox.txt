Weatherbox LyricsEvery man thinks he does what he can
Then he (?) and he's holding the weatherbox
Every night (?)
Then he (?) and he's holding the weatherbox
Holding the weatherbox
Holding the weatherbox
Sun is falling down
Sky is falling down
Seasons falling down
Air is falling down
The air is round and the world is flat
And everything is clearly impossible
Clearly impossible
Inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherboxEmbed
