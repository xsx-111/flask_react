The Ballad of Johnny Burma LyricsI said my mother's dead
Well, I don't care about it
I said my father's dead
But I don't care about it
It happens anyway
It happens anyway
On the edge of Burma
We're on the edge of Burma, oh
I said my baby twists
She twists the night away
I swear she twists so good
And then she turned to me
And then she turned to me
And then I heard her say
"Well, that's the way I like it
Well, that's the way I like it
I like it too much"Embed
