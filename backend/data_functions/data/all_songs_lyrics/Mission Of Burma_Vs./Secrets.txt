Secrets LyricsIt's not just a blink
Or the following of an arm
And it isn't just a flicker
No, it isn't just a flicker
Oh, there's a look in your eyes
That you can't explain
Oh, there's a look in your eyes
And when it slips through the rain
Oh, there's a criss-crossed thinking
(No, it's not just a blink)
There's a deeper tear
(No, it's not just a blink)
From the house you live in
(No, it's not just a blink)
There's a place we can't ignore
(No, it isn't just a flicker)
There's a look in your eyes
And it's two-thirds real
It's the pulling of the undertow
When you can't control the wheel
It's not just a blink
Or the following of an arm
No, it isn't just a flicker
No, it isn't just a flicker
There's a look in your eyes
That you can't explain
There's a look in your eyes
And it slips through the rain
Underneath the gaze
Underneath the gaze
Underneath the guise
Underneath the guise
Underneath the gaze
Underneath the guise
Underneath it goes awayEmbed
