Fun World LyricsWhen you are young
They kick you in the head
And when you grow up
They're still fucking with your head
So when I found out
What it was I didn't want
I start to run
And I start to hunt
'Cause at the bottom of the well
The seed is a pit
And it makes me wanna make the world
Nervous as shit
Because I'm made of gold, brass
And I wanna break it like glass, glass, glass
So when I was young
It didn't make any sense
And when I grew up
It made just as little sense
So when I found out
What it was I didn't want
I got new armor
And I started to hunt
'Cause at the bottom of the well
The seed is a pit
And it makes me wanna make the world
Nervous as shit
Because I'm made of gold, brass
And I wanna break it like glass, glass, glass
Fun world
Fun world
Fun world
Fun world
Fun world
