Dead Pool LyricsHad the choice but lost my chance
Heard a voice and changed my stance
All I needed was a clue
Had enough of golden rules
Now the days are open wounds
All I needed was a clue
Find a way to turn things back
What never happened seems to last
Where did things go wrong?
Where did things go wrong?
Where did things go wrong?
Where did things go wrong?Embed
