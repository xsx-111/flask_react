OK/No Way LyricsSo you think you've got it all worked out
Ok
So you think you've got it figured out
Ok
So you think you've got it all worked out
Ok
And at night you've got no doubt
No way
Got a feeling inside of me
Ok
(?) it might not be
Ok
(?) that don't move an inch
Ok
(?) got no sense
No way
Don't tell me that god is dead
Don't tell me that Marx is dead
When it's times like this my friend
I don't feel too well myself, no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
So you think you've got it all worked out
Ok
So you think you've got it figured out
Ok
So you think you've got it all worked out
Ok
And at night you've got no doubt
No way
Don't tell me that god is dead
Don't tell me that Marx is dead
When it's times like this my friend
I don't feel too well myself, no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh noEmbed
