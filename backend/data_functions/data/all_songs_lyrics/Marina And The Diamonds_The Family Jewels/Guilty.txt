Guilty Lyrics
I was dreaming something dark
Hiding body parts
A broken dog, a broken leg
I left it cold, I left it dead

Oh, I'm a guilty one
And they know what I have done
Yeah, I'm a troubled one
And I won't be forgiven

Guilty on the run, and I know what I have done
Guilty on the run, and I'm never forgiven
I was just a kid that you could not forgive because it's harder
I was just a kid and all I really wanted was my father

Killed a dog so small and rare
Touched its technicoloured hair
I left it bruised and black and lame
I left it running, full of shame

Oh, I'm a guilty one
And they know what I have done
Yeah, I'm a troubled one
And I won't be forgiven
Guilty on the run, and I know what I have done
Guilty on the run, and I'm never forgiven
I was just a kid that you could not forgive because it's harder
I was just a kid and all I really wanted was my father

Spent years singing to forget (To forget)
I spent years singing "no regret"
Then suddenly, it all becomes clear
I've been sorry all these years

I was just a kid that you could not forgive because it's harder
I was just a kid and all I really wanted was my father
Guilty on the run, and I know what I have done
Guilty on the run, and I'm never forgiven
Guilty on the run, and I know what I have done
Guilty on the run, and I'm never forgiven11Embed
