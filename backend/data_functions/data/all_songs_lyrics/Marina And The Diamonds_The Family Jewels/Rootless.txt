Rootless Lyrics
I'm a cloud drifting by
Dripping tears from the sky
I'm a snail without a shell
Leper with a golden bell
I've got nowhere to go
I'm a stray cat on the roam
Choking on a chicken bone
For a home-sweet, no sweet home

For a root, for a leaf, for a branch, for a tree
For something, somebody that reminded them of me

Running with my roots pulled up
Caught me cold so they could cut
What there was left of love
I'm rootless, I'm rootless

Working fingers to the bone
Building castles out of snow
I'm a nomad walking on
Humming to the same old song
Lowercase society
Tied to no community
A kingdom without a king
With no sense of belonging
For a root, for a leaf, for a branch, for a tree
For something, somebody that reminded them of me

Running with my roots pulled up
Caught me cold so they could cut
What there was left of love
I'm rootless, I'm rootless

Running with my roots pulled up
So they could cut me free of love

Running with my roots pulled up
Caught me cold so they could cut
What there was left of love
I'm rootless, I'm rootless

Dragging my roots through the snow
No home-sweet and no sweet home
I've got nowhere to go
I'm rootless, I'm rootless3Embed
