Seventeen Lyrics
Used to be a major scale
But the melody went stale
Musical cacophony let
Insy winsy spider free
You're a rich little boy
Who's had to work for his toys
You've got all sensibilities, oh
Of an upper class guy

No, no, I'm not your little slave
No, I don't twist and turn that way
Only got bad things to say
You're always asking what is up, up with me

Could never tell you what happened
The day I turned seventeen
The rise of a king and the fall of a queen, oh
Seventeen
Seventeen

Oh, you were embarrassed of me
'Cause I used my tongue freely
Bet you wish I couldn't speak, 'cause when I do
You know I tell you why you appear weak
You want a hassle-free life?
Go get your upper class wife
Oh, she's got all the personality, oh
Of a lemon that has been
Truly sucked dry
You teach me how to behave
I felt you question the way
I was brought up as a baby
Well, you don't know fuck about my family

Could never tell you what happened
The day I turned seventeen
The rise of a king and the fall of a queen, oh
Seventeen (seventeen)
No, seventeen
Oh, seventeen
The rise of a king and the fall of a queen, oh
Seventeen

Never fell down like a princess
I used to kid myself in this dress
That it was just how things
Were meant to be
Oh, seventeen
