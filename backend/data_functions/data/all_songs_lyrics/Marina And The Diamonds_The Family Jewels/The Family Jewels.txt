The Family Jewels Lyrics
I can't break the cycle, am I just a fool?
Falling down like dominoes, hit by family jewels
Pass it down from kid to kid, the chain will never end
'Less I decide to go to it, will I see the end?

Ooh, don't you find it strange?
Only thing we share is one last name
Did I beat you at your own game?
Typical of me to put us all to shame

Welcome to the family jewels
Coal to diamond, sold to fools
Welcome to the family jewels
Simmerin' sapphire can't keep his cool
I can't keep my cool
I can't keep my cool

Family said that I decided to live a loveless life
Is it my fault we stay divided? 'Cause I got too much pride
Pass the parcel, wrap, unwrap, and open up the locks
Out come flying all the secrets of Pandora's box
Oh, you think I'm unfit
Little did you know that I was cut for it
No glass slipper will ever fit
'Cause I could never see a diamond in it

Welcome to the family jewels
Coal to diamond, sold to fools
Welcome to the family jewels
Simmerin' sapphire can't keep his cool
I can't keep my cool
I can't keep my cool

And when we're in the dark, it echoes in your heart
And when you're far away, it beckons me to stay
And when we're in the dark, it echoes in your heart
And when you're far away, it beckons me to stay

Welcome to the family jewels
Coal to diamond, sold to fools
Welcome to the family jewels
Simmerin' sapphire can't keep his cool
I can't keep my cool
I can't keep my cool
Welcome to the family jewels
Coal to diamond, sold to fools
Welcome to the family jewels
Simmerin' sapphire can't keep his cool
I can't keep my cool
I can't keep my cool8Embed
