I Am Not a Robot Lyrics
You've been acting awful tough lately
Smoking a lot of cigarettes lately
But inside, you're just a little baby, oh
It's okay to say you've got a weak spot
You don't always have to be on top
Better to be hated
Than loved, loved, loved for what you're not

You're vulnerable, you're vulnerable
You are not a robot
You're loveable, so loveable
But you're just trouble

Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot

You've been hanging with the unloved kids
Who you never really liked and you never trusted
But you are so magnetic, you pick up all the pins
Never committing to anything
You don't pick up the phone when it ring, ring, rings
Don't be so pathetic, just open up and sing
I'm vulnerable, I'm vulnerable
I am not a robot
You're loveable, so loveable
But you're just trouble

Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot

Can you teach me how to feel real?
Can you turn my power off?
And let the drum beat drop

Guess what? I am not a robot
Guess what? I am not a robot
Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot
Guess what? I'm not a robot, a robot33Embed
