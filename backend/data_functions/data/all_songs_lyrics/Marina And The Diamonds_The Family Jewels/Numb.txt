Numb Lyrics
One track mind like a goldfish
Stuck inside my petri-dish
I can't breathe, and I can't smile
This better be worth my while

I feel numb most of the time
Lower I get, the higher
I'll climb, and I will wonder why
I got dark only to

Shine, looking for the golden light
Oh, it's a reasonable sacrifice
Burn, burn, burn bright

Forego families, forego friends
It's how it started, how it ends
I can't open up and cry
'Cause I've been silent all my life

I feel numb most of the time
Lower I get, the higher
I'll climb, and I will wonder why
I got dark only to
Shine, looking for the golden light
Oh, it's a reasonable sacrifice
Burn, burn, burn bright
Burn, burn, burn bright

Ooh, I get dark
Oh, and I'm in Hell
I need a friend
Ooh, but I can't yell
Yeah, I'm no good
No good to anyone
'Cause all I care about
Is being number one

Shine, looking for the golden light
Oh, it's a reasonable sacrifice
Shine, looking for the golden light
Oh, it's a reasonable sacrifice, sacrifice

I feel numb most of the time
Lower I get, the higher
I'll climb, and I will wonder why
I got dark only to shine
And I'll light up the sky
Stars that burn the brightest
Fall so fast and pass you by
Cough like empty lighters
I feel numb most of the time
Lower I get, the higher
I'll climb, and I will wonder why
I get dark only to shine
And I'll light up the sky
Stars that burn the brightest
Fall so fast and pass you by
Spark like empty lighters...17Embed
