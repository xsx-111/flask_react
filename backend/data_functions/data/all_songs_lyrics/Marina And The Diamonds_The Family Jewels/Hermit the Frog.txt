Hermit the Frog Lyrics
Hmm
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, ooh...

Yeah, I feel I'm watered down
Whenever he's around
I put on the crown of clowns
And melt slowly to the ground
Yeah, I feel it coming on
When I've been static for too long
And an explosion comes in time
Before I go and cross the line
They say, "You used to be so kind
I never knew you had such a dirty mind"

Well, I went to the doctors believing
The devil had control over me, and
I was finding it hard to breathe, and
Finding it hard to fight the feeling

When my heart just burst like a glass balloon
I let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
I broke my glass balloon
I let go of my glass balloon
Uh, uh, uh, uh-oh!

They call him Hermit the Frog
He's looking for a dog
Did you find your bitch in me?
Oh, you're abominable socially
You're just a little bit too much like me
She says, "She used to be so kind"
Well, baby, I give you your dirty mind

Well I, I wanna tell you a secret
You can take your double-standard love and keep it
I can't help the devil likes to make my heart a double bed
And I can't help he sometimes likes to come and rest his little head

When my heart just burst like a glass balloon
I let it fly too high and it shattered too soon
I was the wrong damn girl in the wrong damn room
I broke my glass balloon
I let go of my glass balloon
Oh, my heart just burst like a glass balloon
We let them fly too high and they shatter too soon
Are we the wrong damn people in the wrong damn room?
We broke our glass balloons
We let go of our glass balloons
We broke our glass balloon
Let go of my glass balloon37Embed
