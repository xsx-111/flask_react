Hollywood Lyrics
American queen is the American dream
American queen is the American dream

She is a Polish girl in America
Tall, tan, hot blonde called Anya
I asked her, "Why would you wanna be a Hollywood wife?"
"Because I don't want to end up living in a dive on Vine"
A dive on vine

Air hostesses doing gossip magazine
Crosswords on a flight to JFK
Thirty-nine years old with a mile-high sheen
Trying to stimulate a mind
That is slowly starting to decay
I itch my skin, I jump up and say
"Lady, I know why your thoughts turn grey"

Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
Living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America, ooh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America
A fat security making plays for me
Soon as I touch down in old L.A
He said, "Oh, my god, you look just like Shakira
No, no, you're Catherine Zeta!"
"Actually, my name's Marina"

Your mind is just like mine
All filled up with things benign
You're looking for the golden light

Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America, ooh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America

American dream is the American queen
American queen is the American dream
Is the American dream

Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America, ooh-hoo
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America15Embed
