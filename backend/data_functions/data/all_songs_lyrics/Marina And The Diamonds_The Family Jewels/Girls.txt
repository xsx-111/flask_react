Girls Lyrics
Look like a girl but I think like a guy
Not ladylike to behave like a slime
Easy to be sleazy when you've got a filthy mind
You stick to your yogurts, I'll stick to my apple pie

Girls are not meant to fight dirty
Never look a day past thirty
Not gonna bend over and curtsy for you

Is there any possibility
You'll quit gossiping about me
To hide your insecurities?
All you say is "blah, blah"
Girls, they never befriend me
'Cause I fall asleep when they speak
Of all the calories they eat
All they say is "na, na, na, na, na"
Na, na, na, na, na

Girls, oh, girls, wag your tails to the beat
Of Girls Aloud, oh, the journos in heat
Write such good stories, oh, their mothers must be proud
Making money off your insecurity and doubt
Girls are not meant to fight dirty
Never look a day past thirty
Not gonna bend over and curtsy for you

Is there any possibility
You'll quit gossiping about me
To hide your insecurities?
All you say is "blah, blah"
Girls, they never befriend me
'Cause I fall asleep when they speak
Of all the calories they eat
All they say is "na, na, na, na, na"
Na, na, na, na, na
All they say is "na, na, na" (Na, na, na, na, na)
Na, na, na, na, na (I feel...)

I feel I've been riding in a fast car
Burning dirty gas won't get you that far
I feel I've been riding up the wrong path
But I'm gonna make sure I get the last laugh

Is there any possibility
You'll quit gossiping about me
To hide your insecurities?
All you say is "blah, blah"
Girls, they never befriend me
'Cause I fall asleep when they speak
Of all the calories they eat
All they say is "na, na, na, na, na"
(Wag your tails, wag your tails to the beat)
Na, na, na, na, na
(Wag your tails, wag your tails to the beat)
All they say is "na, na, na, na, na"
(Wag your tails, wag your tails to the beat)
Na, na, na, na, na
(Wag your tails, wag your tails to the beat)9Embed
