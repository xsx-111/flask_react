Tremolo Lyrics(Gimme my body
Gimme my mind
Gimme my body
Gimme my -)
I got the torch on in the dark
And I'm searching for the light
But all I seem to find is nothing
(nothing)
Foraging to find
All the echoes of the past
With a little bit of luck
It'll lead to something
(something)
Just ordinary people
Who be looking for their equal
So they tremolo their soul
Tremolo my soul yeah
Tremolo my soul yeah
Climbing on a ladder
To redeem my fortress
Poor with money
But I know what love is
Separate me from the vultures
Tremolo...
(Gimme my body)
My soul
(Gimme my mind, gimme my body, gimme my mind)
I defend my peace (gimme my body, gimme my mind)
Trample on my soul (gimme my body, gimme my mind)
And I'll defend my peace (gimme my body, gimme my mind)
Tremolo my soul yeah
Tremolo my soul yeah
Gimme my body
Gimme my mind
Gimme my body
Gimme my mind
Gimme my body
Gimme my mind
Gimme my body
Gimme my mind
Tremolo my soul

Yeah
Addicted to the light
Addicted to the light
God damnit
Tremolo my soul
I got the torch on in the darkness and I'm searching for the light but all I seem to find is nothing
Foraging to find
All the echoes of the past
With a little bit of luck
It'll lead to something
Just ordinary people
Who be looking for their equal
So they cater for their hero
Tremolo my soul
