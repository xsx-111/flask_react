Border Girl LyricsDig me up
Lay me down
Do your worst
Go to town
Let me out
Or let me in
You're too late
Once again
You can come a little closer, see what's heathen
Until I see you draw some blood then we even stevens
Shoulda traded it in my past to save my future
Girl or a boy, I don't wanna confuse ya
Border girl, give, give it up, oh, you're living
You don't have to take, take, take all you've given
Border girl, give, give it up, oh, you're living
You don't have to take, take, take all you've given
Miracle, send another miracle
Miracle, send another miracle
Miracle, send another miracle
Miracle, send another miracle
Beauty, skin deep
Peeling makes bleed
Always leaves me crying
Cruelly grinning
Do your sinning
All the way to dying
Dig me up
Lay me down
Do your worst
Go to town
You can come a little closer, see what's heathen (Let me out)
Till I see you draw some blood then we even stevens (Or let me in)
Shoulda traded it in my past to save my future (You're too late)
Girl or a boy, I don't wanna confuse ya (Once again)
(Ahyeeyah)

Border girl, give, give it up, oh, you're living (Ahyeeyah)
You don't have to take, take, take all you've given (Ahyeeyah)
Border girl, give, give it up, oh, you're living (Ahyeeyah)
You don't have to take, take, take all you've given (Ahyeeyah)

Border girl, give, give it up, oh, you're living
(Send another miracle)
You don't have to take, take, take all you've given
(Send another miracle)
Border girl, give, give it up, oh, you're living
(Send another miracle)
You don't have to take, take, take all you've given
(Send another miracle)
In the morning I awake
In the morning I escape
And the warning comes too late
Yeah, I doing alright ee-yi ee-yi yeah
Yeah-ee-yeah
Yeah-ee-yeah
Miracle
