Picking You Lyrics
I'm picking you and you
'Cause that's all that seems to matter to me lately
All alone by yourself
What do you do
It's the closest thing to heaven maybe
Lay low
What you missing
Is ammunition
Pay the toll
Save your soul
Before they getcha
Lay low
What you missing
Ammunition

Keep your lights off
Curtains closed
Whatever currency that holds
Strangers to ourselves
They take your money
But they hate your kind
Oh the power of money
Oh why oh why do I always end up with Scorpios or Geminis
See I don't want no adios
To get close
Yaaaoow
Ahhh woo hah hah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahhh woo hah hah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahhh woo hah hah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahhh woo hah hah

The only time I go to church is when someone's in the casket ooou I said the only time I got to church is when someone in the casket
(mmmmm)
Good men are strange, bad men are obvious
Mama said the good men are strange
Bad men are obvious

I'm picking you and you
'Cause you don't really matter to me
You'll never find your way to heaven
But you can follow me
Oou oou oou oou ooooooou
Oou oou oou oou ooooooou
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahhh woo hah hah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahhh woo hah hah
You'll never find your way to heaven
You'll never find your way to heaven
Oou oou oou oou ooooooou
Oou oou oou oou ooooooou
Good men are strange
Bad men are obvious
Mama said the good men are strange
Bad men are obvious
Heaven

You'll never find your way to heaven
