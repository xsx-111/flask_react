Holy Ghost Lyrics
The judge and the paralegal tell me that I’m liable
The cost that you pay; you swap the bevy for the Bible
Heading to the promised land
Ruled by the masculine
Tied to the country
But we’re all from the motherland
Those who were humble, they stumble and crumble
Ooh, what a tragedy
I’m the false currency
Giving you the dollar as I chick-a chick-a change ya
I’m not here to drown ya
I’m only here to cleanse ya

I’ll cross the border in the morning
And I won’t stop to hear your warnings
Who‘s coming with me, are you all in?
’Cause we’re up, running till the day is dawning

I got the holy ghost fire in me
Dancing in hell
You could call it blasphemy
I got the holy ghost fire in me
Dancing in hell
You could call it blasphemy
I got the holy ghost fire in me
Dancing in hell
You could call it blasphemy
I got the holy ghost fire
Holy ghost fire
In me, in me, in me

You can tell your deity, I’m alright
Wake up in the bed, call me Jesus Christ

It’s only superstition if you ever listen
I saw myself self-assault in a premonition
I saw myself smelling salts in the South Pacific
I’m so prolific
I done and did it

Ever seen a rainbow, oh
Ever go where the rain don’t, oh
Ever seen a rainbow, oh
Ever go where the rain don’t
Salty pillar, philosophic polyfilla
Deserted in the desert, turning sand into a mirror
Fables and cables, turning tablets into tables
I'm outchea, empty cradle in the stable

I’ll cross the border in the morning
And I won’t stop to hear your warnings
Who‘s coming with me, are you all in?
’Cause we’re up, running till the day is dawning

I got the holy ghost fire in me
Dancing in hell
You could call it blasphemy
I got the holy ghost fire in me
Dancing in hell
You could call it blasphemy
I got the holy ghost fire in me
Dancing in hell
You could call it blasphemy
I got the holy ghost fire
Holy ghost fire
In me, in me, in me
You can tell your deity, I’m alright
Wake up in the bed, call me Jesus Christ
You can tell your deity, I’m alright
Wake up from the dead, call me Jesus Christ
You can tell your deity, I’m alright
Wake up in the bed, call me Jesus Christ
You can tell your deity, I’m alright
Wake up in the bed, call me Jesus ChristEmbed
