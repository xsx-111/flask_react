In My View Lyrics
Lay my belly on a woman
Leave a damsel for Delilah
Dagger for the damned, the damned, the damned
Fine wine and foie gras

In my view, nothing’s ever given away
I believe to advance then you must pay
In my view, love will never come my way
So, when I leave, you’ll be dancing on my grave

I wanna be king until I am
A man is just a man, I understand
Has everything gone to plan?
Don’t say it out loud, just let me dance

I know you wanna, say you wanna
I never said I was a saint, I'm a sin again, ah
Sin again, ah, and then a sinner
Again, again, ah, again, again, ah
I really wanna take your honour
I’m writing blank checks, I’m a greedy bugger
I’ll take your daughter to feel the thunder
Daddy’s little girl, now the reaper got her
In my view, nothing’s ever given away
I believe to advance then you must pay
In my view, love will never come my way
So, when I leave, you’ll be dancing on my grave

Lay my belly on a woman
Leave a damsel for Delilah
Dagger for the damned, the damned, the damned
Fine wine and foie gras
The torture makes it sweet
So sweet, even more delicious
Animal, rest in peace
You're no longer vicious (In my view)
Animal, rest in peace
You're no longer vicious (I believe)
Animal, rest in peace
Say no more, please baby (In my view)
Animal, rest in, you're no longer vicious
Say no more, please (So when I leave)
Just cradle, cradle
You're no longer vicious
In my view, nothing’s ever given away
Say no more, please baby
Just cradle, cradle me
In my view, nothing’s ever given away
(Damned, the damned, the damned, the damned, the damned)
I believe to advance then you must pay
(Say no more, please)
In my view, love will never come my way
(Animal, rest in peace)
So, when I leave, you’ll be dancing on my grave
You’ll be dancing on my grave
(You're no longer vicious)

Trickles down your mouth into​ your hand
I wanna be king until I am
I wanna be king until I am
I wanna be king until I am
Man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man10Embed
