See How LyricsSomeday I'll be a star
That's shining bright in the sky
I'm giving up on you bastards
Give me lovers
So I may have my pleasures
And not lose my heart
In this squalor
I've never seen wicked ones face their fears
Yet I've always seen brave men filled with tears
Older you get
The golder you get
Say yeah
Say yeah
Say yeah
Uuhhh yeah
Cheka-Cheka-Chance
Chicken-Chicken shoulda took a chance
Sometimes when I feel remorseful
And I wish I could've lived a life more less normal
So typical
Over critical
Cheka-Cheka-Chance
Chicken-Chicken shoulda took a chance
Empty my body
Just to feel the love
What's the price of the light
When you're stuck in the shadows
Don't let me know
See how it goes
Cheka-Cheka-Change
Chicken-Chicken shoulda took a chance
See how
See how it all
See how it all goes
See how
(See how it goes) How
See how it all goes (See how it goes)
See how it all goes (See how it goes)
Goes (See how it goes) goes
(See how it goes) goes1Embed
