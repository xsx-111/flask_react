Lord Lyrics
Lord, don’t pay me no mind
Lord, if you choose a time
Lord, don’t pay me no mind
I'll take another one and I'll be yours
Lord, if you choose a time
I'll hear the chimes
Lord, don’t pay me no mind
Lord, if you choose a time
I'll hear the chimes

It's too late
Too late
I won't see you later
If you fade
I'll fade
Fading together
Her love is blind
Her love is kind
Her love is mine
(Her love is mine)
Love wants to give
Hate wants the thrills
Joy hates the pain
The pain we all need
The pain we need to feel
If wishes were horses
Then beggars would ride
This is my cross to bear
This is my cross to bear
This is my cross to bear
This is my cross to bear

Lord, don’t pay me no mind
I'll take another one and I'll be yours
Lord, if you choose a time
I'll hear the chimes
Lord, don’t pay me no mind
I'll take another one and I'll be yours
Lord, if you choose a time
I'll hear the chimes

While the government wants to control
Her culture will set you free2Embed
