Turn Lyrics
I've always been this way
All my days
I've always been this way
All my days
I've always been this way
All my days
You really don't want the imitation
You really don't want the imitation

I'm not like you
I'm not like you
It's just like you to
Ooooh ooooh
Wanna turn

Money buys you isolation
Give the Pied Piper a raise
Sold my shortcomings
For a price at the Bureau of Change
Champagne socialite
Blue eyed soul boy
Too big a fight to fight
Yeah, you're better off dead boy
Soon the peace will come to an end
So gimme gimme a chance
To change
So take the basket to collection
Here's the thing about progression
I didn't work this damn hard
To stay where I belong
I didn't work this damn hard
To stay where I belong
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah

Wanna turn
My eyes blue
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
Don't you turn
My brown eyes blue
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
Oooh oooh

You sing your lilt
And drink your milk
To make you strong
And you ain't wrong
To use your skills
To get where you belong
You set demands
You take your chance
But you are not special
Learn your lessons
No such things as blessings
You sing your lilt
And drink your milk
To make you strong
And you ain't wrong
To use your skills
To get where you belong
You set demands
You take your chance
But you are not special
Learn your lessons
No such things as blessings
Wanna turn
My eyes blue
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
Don't you turn
My brown eyes blue
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
Oooh oooh
Always been this way
Always been this way
Always been this way
Always been this way
I'm not like you
Not like you
I'm not like you
Not like you
I've always been this way
Not like you
I've always been this way
Not like you

Wanna turn
My eyes blue
I'm not like you
I'm not like you
Don't you turn
My brown eyes blue
I'm not like you
I'm nothing like you
Nah nah nah1Embed
