Again
Send a bad man home
I really need to find
It's right there for you
It's right there for you
It's right there for you
Say it's right there for you
And he said
Nice set of knives
Give me a slice
I like your flesh
I know what's best
You can be my only guest
Dressed in Sunday's best
And he said
Nice set of knives
Give me a slice
I like your flesh
I know what's best
You can be my cause of death
Dressed in Sunday's best
And he said
And she said
A nice set of knives
Give me a slice
I like your flesh
Send a bad man home
Send a bad man home
Send a bad man
I really need to find
It's right there for you
It's right there for you
It's right there for you
Say it's right there for you
It's right there for you
It's right there for you
It's right there for you
Say it's right there for you
Say it's all there for you
Send a bad man home
Say it's all there for you
Hey

Looking into my eyes
And your eyes turn grey
No way

Well for goodness sake
Seen it in your face
And your hair turned grey
Good evening
Good night
Good day
They say

It's a halle-fucking-lujah
Now we gonna do you
Good good
Well for goodness sake
Seen it in your face
And your hair turned grey
Good evening
Good night
Good day
