Reena Lyrics
You keep me coming home again
You keep me coming home again

When you were gone
I met a friend
She taught me how to
Live in the end

You keep me coming home again
You keep me coming home again

Are her eyes
Brown or blue?
How does she keep her
Static cool
My heart and soul
Are rocked up in her eyes
A little blink, yea, I recognize
A little blink, yea, that's my prize
A white horse
Sitting right there by her side
Hard to ignore
Hard to disguise
She'll never ever
Realize
You keep me coming home again
You keep me coming home again

When you were gone
I was out of my mind

I had a friend who laughed all the time
I had a friend who cried all the time
I had a friend who screamed all the time
I had a friend who lied all the time1Embed
