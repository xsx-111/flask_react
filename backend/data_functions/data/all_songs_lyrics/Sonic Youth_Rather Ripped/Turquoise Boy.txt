Turquoise Boy Lyrics
Turquoise boy I must confess to you
Sweet liberation has come
You are a legend in a lovely game
But now I feel I must run

Turquoise boy the sky is calling me
Sweet isolation in the sun
You are a soldier in a sad charade
How can you lose what's never found

Turquoise boy I must confess to you
Sweet liberation has come
You are a legend in a lovely game
But now I feel I must run1Embed
