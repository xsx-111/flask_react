Jams Run Free Lyrics
Blasted earth
Oh immersed
Gold in cave
The blondes come first

I love the way you move
I hope it's not too late for me
It's too good on the sea
Where the light is green
Where the light is green

Jagged brain
Slow refrain
We love the jams
And jams run free

I love the way you move
I hope it's not too late for me
It's too good on the sea
Where the light is green
Where the light is green
Jagged brain
Slow refrainEmbed
