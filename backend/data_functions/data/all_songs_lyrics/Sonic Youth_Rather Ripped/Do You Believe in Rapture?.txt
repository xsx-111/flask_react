Do You Believe in Rapture? Lyrics
Stand behind his drunken amp
Stand behind his light of love
Hear him yowl his bloody tongue
Hear him yell for blood and war

Do you believe in this sweet sensation?
Do you believe in second chance?
Do you believe in rapture, babe?

A terrible hit strikes today
A terrible hit for the parade
Burning eyes seek Jesus coming
Jesus comes to pave the way

Do you believe in this sweet sensation?
Do you believe in second chance?
Do you believe in rapture, babe?

Can you tell me what to feel?
Open up your tender soul
Can I drink your drunken mercy?
Wine burns the devils whole
Do you believe in this sweet sensation?
Do you believe in second chance?
Do you believe in rapture, babe?2Embed
