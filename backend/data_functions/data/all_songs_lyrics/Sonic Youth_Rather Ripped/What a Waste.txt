What a Waste Lyrics
Hey give me hollow stimulation
It's so sleazy to be free
Let's invest in dull creation
Thrill city cheap legacy

What a waste
You're so chaste
I can't wait
To taste your face

Vapid signals lead me to you
A sublime spectacular dud
Safe and sound from chatter confusion
Get the picture yes it's clear as mud

What a waste
You're so chaste
I can't wait
To taste your face

Hey give me hollow stimulation
It's so sleazy to be free
Let's invest in dull creation
Thrill city cheap legacy
What a waste
You're so chaste
I can't wait
To taste your face

I wouldn't lead you on
Ever since your song yeah
You could have had it all
But you didn't call meEmbed
