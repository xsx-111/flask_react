The Neutral Lyrics
He's not a dreamer or a schemer
Running away from me
He's not a singer, an entertainer
With no follow through
He's not a poet or a mystic
With his cigarette unglued
He just neutral, and he's weary
Not even brand new

It's a perfect sin
Close your eyes and lose the rest
It's a perfect sin
Close your mind and feel the best

Everyone has a headache
Imprecise, hard to cure
Got to shake it, what ails you
The lines are a blur
Is it a pain in your heart
Dark and gray from the start
You won't seduce me, or attract me
Just because you're a stray
It's a perfect sin
Close your eyes and lose the rest
It's a perfect sin
Close your mind and feel the best

Why won't you tell me what's inside your head
Why won't you show me your secret bed, secret head?

He's not a dreamer or a schemer
Running away from you
He's not a singer, an entertainer
With no follow through
He's not a poet or a mystic
With his cigarette unglued
He's not a cowboy or a loner
With nothing to do
He's neutral, and he's weary
Not even brand new
He's neutral, yeah he's weary
And he's so in love with youEmbed
