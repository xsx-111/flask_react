Pink Steam Lyrics
I just come by to run you over
I just come by to see you quiver
You can come, you can slip inside, babe
Killer eyes and a burnin' heart, babe

Don't you know you need no other
I'm the man who loves your mother

Open up your arms to me, girl
Let me feel your wild heartbeat, girl
Sweet lips, flowers and cream
Deep in love surrender pink steam

Deep in love you need no other
Deep in love your lonely lover

Feel your wild heart beat
Lonely lover
Open up to me
Lonely mother
Your sweet lips on mine
Like flowers and cream
Oh killer, killer eyes
