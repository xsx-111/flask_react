Or Lyrics
In your mouth a wad of cash
Moist roll of hundreds
Fingers through your hair
Silver quarters drop
To your pleated skirt
Canisters of whipped cream
In your sweater pockets
A look of space and total life
Ready or not

The plan is to go to D.C. and hang out
Go see girls rock
How long is the tour?
What time you guys playing?
Where you going next?
What comes first
The music or the words?Embed
