Lights Out Lyrics
She scans the room
For a star to consume
When eye contact is made
I suggest son you fix your grave

'Cause it's lights out for you
Lights out for you
There's not a hell of a lot you can do
It's lights out for you

He rolls his eyes
At the thought of paradise
But when he makes that insect sound
Then it's time girl for you to leave town

'Cause it's lights out for you
Lights out for you
There's not a hell of a lot you can do
It's lights out for you

She scans the room
For a star to consume
When eye contact is made
I suggest son you fix your grave
'Cause it's lights out for you
Lights out for you
Lights out for you
Lights out for you
Lights out for you
Lights out for you
There's not a hell of a lot you can do
It's lights out for youEmbed
