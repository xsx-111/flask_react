Looking For A Boy LyricsI am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love
Tell me, please, where can he be
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of
It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe
When he says "Hello!"
So, I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love
If it's true that love affairs are all arranged in heaven
My guardian angel's holding out on me
So I'm looking for a boy about 5 foot 6 or 7
And won't be happy 'til I'm on his knee
I'll be blue until he comes my way
Hope he takes the cue
When I am say
Tell me, please, where can he be
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of
It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe
When he says "Hello!"
So I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love
Won't you find that boy?
Help me find a boy
Who's looking for a girl to loveEmbed
