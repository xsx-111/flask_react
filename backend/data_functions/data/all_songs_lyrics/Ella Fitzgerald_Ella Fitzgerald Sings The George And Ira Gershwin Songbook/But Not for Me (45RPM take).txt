But Not for Me (45RPM take) LyricsThey're writing songs of love
But not for me
A lucky stars above
But not for me!
With love to lead the way
I've found more clouds of gra-ay
Than any Russian play
Coud garauntee
I was a fool to fall
And get that way
Hi-Ho alas
And also lack a day
Although I can't dismiss
The memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for meEmbed
