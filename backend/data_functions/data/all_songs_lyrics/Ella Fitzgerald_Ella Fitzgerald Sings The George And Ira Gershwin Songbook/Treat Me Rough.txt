Treat Me Rough Lyrics
When I was born, they found a silver spoon in my mouth
And so I always had the best of care
When winter came up north, of course they motored me south
Where I was princess in our villa there
Tutors and headwaiters fawned on me
Life was just a bore 'til it dawned on me
The cushy sheltered way of life was really no fun
From now on, some manhandling must be done

So treat me rough
Muss my hair
Don't you dare to handle me with care
I'm no innocent child, baby
Keep on treating me wild
Treat me rough
Pinch my cheek
Kiss and hug and squeeze me 'til I'm weak
I've been pampered enough, baby
Keep on treatin' me rough


Treat me rough
Pinch my cheek
Kiss and hug and squeeze me 'til I'm weak
I've been pampered enough, baby
Keep on treatin' me
Keep on beatin' me
Keep on treatin' me roughEmbed
