Funny Face LyricsVerse 1:
Jimmy:
Frankie, dear, your birthday gift reveals to me
That at heart you're really not so bad
If I add, y our funny face appeals to me
Please dont' think I've suddenly gone mad
You have all the qualities of Peter Pan;
I'd go far before I'd find a sweeter pan
And yet
Refrain:
I love your funny face
Your sunny, funny face;
For you're a cutie
With more than beauty
You've got a lot
Of personality N.T
A thousand laughs I've found
In having you around
Through you're not Gloria Swanson
For worlds I'd not replace
Your sunny, funny face
Verse 2:
Frankie:
Needn't tell me that I'm not so pretty, dear
When my looking glass and I agree
In the contest at Atlantic City, dear
Miss America I'd never be
Truth to tell, though, you're not such a bad lot yourself;
As a Paul Swan, you are not so hot yourself
And yet
Refrain 2:
I love your funny face
Your sunny, funny face;
You can't repair it
So I declare it
Is quite all right -
Jimmy:
Like Ronald Colman?
Frankie:
So's your ol' man!
Yet it's very clear
I'm gladwhen you are near
Though you're no Handsome Harry
For worlds I'd not replace
Your sunny funny face
Refrain 3:
I love that funny face
That sunny, funny face;
Thought it upsets one
In time, it gets one -
That's true, for you
Have personality for two
Those eyes! Those nose! Those cheek!
Won't make a movie sheik
But though your'e not patootie
For worlds I'd not replace
Your sunny, funny face
Extra chorus:
Frankie: 
I love your funny face
Your sunny, funny face;
You never bother
About your father
Have you no shame?
You're just a mutt and nothing but!
Yet when you wag your tail
You'll never be for sale
Though you're no Rin Tin Tin, dear
For worlds I'd not replace
Your sunny, funny faceEmbed
