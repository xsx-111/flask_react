Shall We Dance LyricsDrop that long face
Come on have your fling
Why keep nursing the blues?
If you want this old world on a string
Put on your dancing shoes
Stop wasting time
Put on your dancing shoes
Watch your spirits climb
Shall we dance
Or keep on mopin'?
Shall we dance
And walk on air?
Shall we give in to despair?
Or shall we dance with never a care?
Life is short
We're growing older
Don't you be an also-ran
You'd better dance, little lady
Dance, little man
Dance whenever you canEmbed
