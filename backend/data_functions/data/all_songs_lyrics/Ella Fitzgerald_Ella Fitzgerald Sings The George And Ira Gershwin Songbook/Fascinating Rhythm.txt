Fascinating Rhythm Lyrics
Got a little rhythm, a rhythm, a rhythm
That pitter-pats through my brain
So darn persistent, the day isn't distant
When it'll drive me insane
Comes in the morning without any warning
And hangs around me all day
I'll have to sneak up to it, someday and speak up to it
I hope it listens when I say:

Fascinating rhythm, you've got me on the go
Fascinating rhythm, I'm all a-quiver
What a mess you're making, the neighbors want to know
Why I'm always shaking, just like a fliver

Each morning I get up with the sun
Start a-hopping, never stopping
To find at night no work has been done

I know that once it didn't matter, but now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter, I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off, decide to run along
Somewhere far away off, and make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the gal I used to be
Fascinating rhythm, oh, won't you stop picking on me?

I know that once it didn't matter, but now you're doing wrong
When you start to patter, I'm so unhappy
Won't you take a day off, decide to run along
Somewhere far away off, and make it snappy
Oh, how I long to be the gal I used to be
Fascinating rhythm
Fascinating rhythm
Won't you stop picking on meEmbed
