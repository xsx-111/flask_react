Soon LyricsSoon, the lonely nights will be ended
Soon, two hearts as one will be blended
I've found the happiness I've waited for
The only boy that I was fated for
Oh, soon, a little cottage will find us
Safe with all our cares far behind us
The day you're mine, this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon
Soon, soon, soon, my dear, you'll never be lonely
Soon, you'll find I live for you only
When I'm with you, who cares what time it is?
Or what the place, or what the climate is?
Oh! Soon, our little ship will come sailing
Home through every storm, never failing
The day you're mine, this world will be in tune
Let's make that day come soon
Let's make that day come soonEmbed
