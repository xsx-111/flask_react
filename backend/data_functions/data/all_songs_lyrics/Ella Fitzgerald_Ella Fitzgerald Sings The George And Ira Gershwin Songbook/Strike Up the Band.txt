Strike Up the Band LyricsLet the drums roll out
Let the trumpet call
While the people shout
"Strike up the band"
Hear the cymbals ring
Callin' one and all
To the martial swing
Strike up the band
There is work to be done, to be done
There's a war to be won, to be won
Come, you son of a son of a gun
Take your stand
Fall in line, yea a bow
Come along, let's go
Hey, leader, strike up the band!
Instrumental break
There is work to be done, to be done
There's a war to be won, to be won
Come, you son of a son of a gun
Take your stand
Fall in line, yea a bow
Come on, let's go
Hey, Leader, strike up
Hey, Leader, strike up
Hey, Leader, strike up the bandEmbed
