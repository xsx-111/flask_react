Sam and Delilah Lyrics
Delilah was a floozy
She never gave a damn
Delilah wasn't choosy
'Til she fell for a swell buckaroo
Whose name was Sam

Delilah got in action
Delilah did her cooch
She gave him satisfaction
And he fell 'neath her spell
With the aid of love and hooch

But one day, so they tell us
His true wife, he did crave
Delilah, she got jealous
And she tracked him and hacked him
And dug for Sam a grave
It's always that way with passion
So cowboy, learn to behave
Or else you're liable to cash in
With no tombstone on your grave
Delilah, oh Delilah
She's no babe in the wood
Run cowboy, run a mile
If you love that kind of woman
She'll do you no goodEmbed
