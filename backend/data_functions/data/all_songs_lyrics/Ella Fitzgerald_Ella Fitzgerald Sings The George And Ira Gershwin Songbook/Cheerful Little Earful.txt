Cheerful Little Earful LyricsThere's a cheerful little earfull
Gosh I miss it something fearfull
And this cheerful little earfull
Is the well known "I love you."
Stocks can go down, bus'ness slow down
But the milk and honey flow down
With a cheerful little earful
Of the well known "I love you"
In ev'ry play it's a set phrase
What the public get phrase
But as a pet phrase it'll do do do
Poo-pa-roo-it
Soft and cu-it
Make me happy, you can do it
With a cheerful little earfull
Of the well known "I love you"Embed
