The Half of It Dearie Blues LyricsMmmm (scat)
I've got the "You don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
Oh how I wish you'd drop that anger, and end your cruise
You're just a duffer, who makes me suffer
All the younger set, says your heart's to let
I've got the "You don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
Mmmm (scat)
(instrumental bridge)
I've got the "You don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
Although I know that love's a gamble, I hate to lose
Life will be duller, we'll have no color
Jill without a Jack, makes the future black
I've got the "You don't know the half of it, dearie" blues
Mmmm (scat)
I've got the "You don't know the half of it, dearie" bluesEmbed
