That Certain Feeling LyricsThat certain feeling
The first time I met you
I hit the ceiling
I could not forget you
You were completely sweet
Oh, what could I do?
I wanted phrases
To sing his praises
That certain feeling
The one that they all know
No use concealing
I've got what they call love
Now we're together
Let's find out whether
You're feeling, that feeling too
(bridge)
I felt it happen
Just as you came in view
Grew sort of dizzy
Thought gee, who is he?
That certain feeling
I'm here to confess it
Is so appealing
No words can express it
I can not hide it
I must confide it
I'm feeling that feeling, tooEmbed
