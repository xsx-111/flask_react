He Loves and She Loves LyricsHe loves and she loves
And they love
So why can't you love
And I love like too?
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love
And that's what we both should do
Oh I always knew someday you'd come along
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong
Hear me he loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?
Oh I always knew someday you'd come along
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong
Hear me he loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?
Won't you love me, as I love you?
Original Version:
Verse 1:
Peter:
Now that I have found you
I must hang around you
Though you may refuse me
You will never lose me
If the human race is
Full of happy faces -
Frankie:
It's because they all love
That wonderous thing they call love
Refrain:
Peter:
He loves and she loves
And they love
So why can't you love
And I love like too?
Frankie:
Birds love and bees love
And whispering trees love
And that's what we both should do
Peter:
Oh I always knew someday you'd come along
Frankie:
We'll make a twosome that just can't go wrong
Hear me
Peter:
He loves and she loves
And they love so won't you
Love me as I love you?
Verse 2:
Frankie:
Feel a funny feeling
In my heart a-stealing;
If it's love, I'm for it
Gosh! How I adore it!
You're the silver lining
For which I've been pining
Peter:
Lonesome days are over;
From now on, we're in clover
Repeat refrainEmbed
