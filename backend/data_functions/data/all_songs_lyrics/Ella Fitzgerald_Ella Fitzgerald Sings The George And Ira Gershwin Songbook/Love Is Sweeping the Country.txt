Love Is Sweeping the Country LyricsWhy are people gay
All the night and day
Feeling as they never felt before
What is the thing
That makes them sing?
Rich man, poor man, thief
Doctor, lawyer, chief
Feel a feeling that they can't ignore
It plays a part in every heart
And every heart is shouting, "Encore"
Love is sweeping the country
Waves are hugging the shore
All the sexes
From Maine to Texas
Have never known such love before!
See them billing and cooing
Like the birdies above
Each girl and boy alike
Sharing joy alike
Feels that passion' ll
Soon be national!
Love is sweeping the country
There never was so much love
(bridge)
See them billing and cooing
Like the birdies above
Each girl and boy alike
Sharing joy alike
Feels that passion' ll
Soon be national!
Love is sweeping the country
There never was so much loveEmbed
