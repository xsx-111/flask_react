Love Is Here to Stay LyricsIts very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but forever and a day
The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go
But, oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
Its very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year, but forever and a day
The radio and the telephone
And the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies
And in time may go
But oh, oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
Its here to stay
Its here to stay
Its here to stay
But oh, oh my dear
Our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But forever and a day
Our love is here to stay
Our love is here to stayEmbed
