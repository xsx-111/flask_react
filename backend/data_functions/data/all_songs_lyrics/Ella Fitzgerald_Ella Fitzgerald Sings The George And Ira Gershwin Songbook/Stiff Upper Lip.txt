Stiff Upper Lip LyricsWhat made good queen Bess
Such a great success?
What made Wellington
Do what he did at Waterloo?
What makes every Englishman
A fighter through and through?
It isn't roast beef, or ale, or home, or mother
It's just a little thing they sing to one another
Stiff upper lip, stout fella
Carry on, old fluff
Chin up, keep muddling through
Stiff upper lip, stout fella
When the going's rough
Pip pip to old man trouble
And a toodly-oo too
Carry on through thick and thin
If you feel you're in the right
Does the fighting spirit win?
Quite, quite, quite, quite, quite
Stiff upper lip, stout fella
When you're in the stew
Sober or blotto, this is your motto
Keep muddling through
(Instrumental bridge)
When a bounder starts to hiss
You must give him blow for blow
Make the blighter say, "What's this?
'ullo, 'ullo, 'ullo, 'ullo, 'ullo"
Stiff upper lip, stout fella
When you're in the stew
Sober or blotto, this is your motto
Keep muddling through
Keep muddling through
Keep muddling through
Keep muddling throughEmbed
