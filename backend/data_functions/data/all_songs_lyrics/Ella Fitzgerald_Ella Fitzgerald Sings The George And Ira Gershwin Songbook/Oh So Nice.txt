Oh So Nice LyricsNever thought I'd ever meet a man like you
Who could make my life complete, by dreams come true
The many men I'd known for years all seemed the same
They kept on boring me to tears, and then you came
I was taken off my feet, what could I do
I was above love before
But now I love love, because you're
Oh, oh so nice
Awake or sleeping, it seems
That you keep creeping in my dreams
And it's so nice
When you are near me
Oh my, oh dear oh dear me, I just fly
To paradise
I was above love before
But now I love love, 'cause you're oh, oh, oh so nice
Musical interlude
When you are near me
Oh my, oh dear oh dear me, I just fly
To paradise
I was above love before
But now I love love, 'cause you're oh, oh, oh so nice
'cause you're oh, oh, oh so nice
'cause you're oh, oh, oh so niceEmbed
