Of Thee I Sing (Baby) LyricsFrom the island of manhattan to the coast of gold
From north to south, from east to west
You are the love, I love the best
You're the dreamboat in the sweetest story ever told
A dream I sought, both night and day
For years through all, the u.s.a
The star I hitched my wagon to
Is very obviously you
Of thee I sing, baby
Summer, autumn, winter, spring, baby
You're my silver lining
You're my sky of blue
There's a lovelight shining
Just because of you
Of thee I sing, baby
You have got that certain thing, baby
Shining star and inspiration
Worthy of a mighty nation
Of thee I sing
Musical interlude
Of thee I sing, baby
You have got that certain thing, baby
Shining star and inspiration
Worthy of a mighty nation
Of thee I singEmbed
