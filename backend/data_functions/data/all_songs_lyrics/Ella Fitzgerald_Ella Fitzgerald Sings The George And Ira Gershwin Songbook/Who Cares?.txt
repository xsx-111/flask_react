Who Cares? LyricsLet it rain and thunder
Let a million firms go under
I am not concerned with
Stocks and bonds that I've been burned with!
I love you and you love me
And that's how it will always be
And nothing else can ever mean a thing
Who cares what the public chatters
Love's the only thing that matters
Who cares if the sky cares to fall in the sea
Who cares what banks fail in Yonkers
Long as you've got a kiss that conquers?
Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!
Who cares how history rates me
As long as your kiss intoxicates me?
Why should I care?
Life is one long jubilee
So long as I care for you
And you care for me!Embed
