Somebody from Somewhere LyricsWhen a body knows nobody, what's a body to do?
Shall she weep and sigh?
No, no, and I'll tell you why
Someday, there must come somebody
Bringing heaven in view
And so her courage, she must keep
As she sings herself to sleep
Somebody from somewhere
Will appear someday
I don't know just from where
But he's on his way
I'll just keep on waiting
Waiting 'till I see
Somebody from somewhere
For nobody but me
(instrumental bridge)
I'll just keep on waiting
Waiting 'till I see
Somebody from somewhere
For nobody but meEmbed
