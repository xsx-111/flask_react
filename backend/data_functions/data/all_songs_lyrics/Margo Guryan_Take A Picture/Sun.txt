Sun LyricsSun
Lying in the sun
Had a lot of rain in the winter
All I want is the sun
Doesn't everyone
Have a little pain from time to time?
Now, it's time for the sun to shine
And doesn't it feel good? (Doesn't it feel good?)
Sun
Doesn't hurt my eyes
I can see a lot in the moving patterns
Made by the sun
I close my eyes and I can see
The more I feel. the more I'll be
The sun is an electric show
The more I dream, the more I know
Sun (Sun)
Lying in the sun
Had a lot of rain in the winter
All I want is some
Peace for a minute
All alone in the sun
Sun (Sun)
Lying in the sun
Had a lot of rain in the winter
All I want is some
Peace for a minute
All alone in the sunEmbed
