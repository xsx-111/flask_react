Love LyricsLove
What does it mean
To live between
The beginning and ending of love?
Where do you go
To get to know
The reason why a brand new feeling
Comes to take you
Away from reason?
Love
How do you know
The things you do
You do not only from need
And not from greed
But only from love?
Love
When do you get to be
Someone who can give
And live without hurting
Someone you love?
Why do we grow
And never show
The little that we know of love?
Love, love, loveEmbed
