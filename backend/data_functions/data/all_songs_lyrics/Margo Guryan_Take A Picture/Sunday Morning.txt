Sunday Morning Lyrics
Sunday mornin'
Sun shinin' on your eyes
Sleepy face
Smilin' into mine
Sunday mornin'
Lots of time with nothin' to do
Lots of time to spend with you
On Sunday mornin'

It's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sound of feet walkin' by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do
What other people do
On Sunday mornin'

Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin'
Sunday, Sunday, I love Sunday
Sunday mornin'

Come hold me in your arms
I love you
Everything is alright
Sunday mornin'
Lots of time
Lots of time
On Sunday mornin' (Sunday mornin')
It's so quiet in the street
We can hear the sound of feet walkin' by
I'll put coffee on to brew
We can have a cup or two
And do
What other people do (Other people do)
On Sunday mornin'

Sunday mornin', Sunday mornin'
Sunday, Sunday, I love Sunday
Sunday mornin'

Come hold me in your arms
I love you
Everything is alright
Sunday mornin'
Everything is alright
Sunday mornin'
Everything is alright
Sunday mornin'
Everything is alright
Sunday mornin'
Everything is alright
Sunday mornin'Embed
