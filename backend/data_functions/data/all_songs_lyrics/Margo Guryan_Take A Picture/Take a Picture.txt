Take a Picture LyricsSunny days, happy times
Take a picture so we can remember
The way it feels to love each other
Just in case of cloudy days to come
See the smile on my face
Take a picture so we can remember
The things you do to make me smile this way
Ask a stranger to take a picture
We should have one side by side
Look at me, and say "I love you"
Aren't I the picture of pride?
Sunny days, happy times
Take a picture so we can remember
The things we share
The dreams we're dreaming of
Come and take a picture of love
Sunny days, happy times
Take a picture so we can remember
The things we share
The dreams we're dreaming of
Come and take a picture of loveEmbed
