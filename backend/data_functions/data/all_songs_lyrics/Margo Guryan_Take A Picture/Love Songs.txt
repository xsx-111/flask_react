Love Songs LyricsI heard
Pretty love songs
Comin' from an open window
Today
I stopped
To listen to the love songs
And I had to cry
Why didn't I just walk away?
I knew
All the love songs
Once upon a time he sang them
To me
Today
I was cryin' in the sunshine
When someone said "Is somethin' wrong?"
And I said no, it's just a song
And I can't tell you why
Pretty love songs always make me cry
I knew
All the love songs
Once upon a time he sang them
To me
Today
I was cryin' in the sunshine
When someone said "Is somethin' wrong?"
And I said no, it's just a song
And I can't tell you why
Pretty love songs always make me cryEmbed
