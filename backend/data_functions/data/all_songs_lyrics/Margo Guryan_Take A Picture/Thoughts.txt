Thoughts LyricsMeetin' you
Holdin' hands
Makin' love
No demands
Playin' games
Lyin', too
Growin' bored (Ho-hum)
I'm leavin' you
Runnin' around (Had to keep on runnin')
Bein' unkind (Couldn't help it)
Hurtin' inside
Changin' my mind (Changin' my mind)
Thinkin' hard
Wantin' you
Comin' home
Feelin' new
Climb the stair
Open the door
You're not there
Anymore
Empty room
Lots of tears
Call your name
No one hears me (Nobody hears)
No one hears me (Nobody hears)
No one hears me (Nobody hears)
No one hears meEmbed
