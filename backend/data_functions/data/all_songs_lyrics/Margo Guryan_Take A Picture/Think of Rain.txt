Think of Rain LyricsIf you should think of leavin' me
Think of rain
And think of yesterday again
Think of rain
Think of holdin' hands and runnin' for cover
Laughin' all the time and stoppin' to kiss
Under the weepin' willow tree
If I should break your heart one day
Think of rain
And maybe you will have to smile
Think of rain
Maybe then you will forgive me
I'd want you to forgive me
Think of rain
Think of rain
If one day you should think of leavin' me
If one day you should think of leavin' me
Think of rain
Think of rain
If one day you should think of leavin' meEmbed
