What Can I Give You LyricsWhat can I give you?
What would make you happy?
What can I do?
What can I say
To make the bad times go away?
It's been a long, long time
Since I've seen you smile
And I've been wanting
To do something about it
For a long, real long while
What can I give you
To drive away the sadness?
What can I buy?
What can I try?
Tell me what I can do
It's been a long, long time
And you know I knew you when
You used to be happy
What can I give you
To make you happy again?
It's been a long, long time
Since I've seen you smile
And I've been wanting
To do something about it
For a long, real long while
What can I give you
To drive away the sadness?
What can I buy?
What can I try?
Tell me what I can do
It's been a long, long time
And you know I knew you when
You used to be happy
What can I give you
To make you happy again?Embed
