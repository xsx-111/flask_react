Someone I Know LyricsI was thinkin'
Of leavin'
There was no one around here
I wanted to know
Then I saw someone
Who
Happened
To remind me of
Bein' in love a long time ago
I know
And you know
That we never met before tonight
Why, then, should I feel so right
About bein' in your arms?
You've been good to me now
And I don't wanna go
Your lips are warm and familiar
And you feel like someone I know
I know
And you know
That we never met before tonight
Why, then, should I feel so right
About bein' in your arms?
You've been good to me now
And I don't wanna go
Your lips are warm and familiar
And you feel like someone I knowEmbed
