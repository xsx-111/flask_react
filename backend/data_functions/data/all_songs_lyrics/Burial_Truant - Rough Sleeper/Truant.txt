Truant LyricsNo
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
I fell in love with you
Cause you are the one
No
Doesn't really mean I want you
It seems to go on
Doesn't really mean I want you
It seems to go on
I like the way you smile
Eyes out
I like the way you smile
Passion
It started there
Doesn't really mean I want you
It seems to
It seems to go on
I like the way you smile
You can tweet me
You can tweet me
You can tweet me
You can
I like the way you smile
