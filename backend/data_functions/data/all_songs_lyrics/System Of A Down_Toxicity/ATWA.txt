ATWA Lyrics
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

Hey you, see me, pictures, crazy
All the world I've seen before me passing by
I've got nothing; to gain, to lose
All the world I've seen before me passing by

You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel it anymore

Anymore, na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

Hey, you are me, not so pretty
All the world I've seen before me passing by
Silent, my voice, I've got no choice
All the world I've seen before me passing by
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel it anymore

I don't see (Anymore)
I don't hear (Anymore)
I don't speak (Anymore)
I don't feel...

Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

Hey you, see me, pictures, crazy
All the world I've seen before me passing by
I've got nothing; to gain, to lose
All the world I've seen before me passing by
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel there anymore
You don't care 'bout how I feel
I don't feel it anymore

I don't sleep (Anymore)
I don't eat (Anymore)
I don't live (Anymore)
I don't feel (Anymore)21Embed
