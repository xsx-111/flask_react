Show your people, show your people how we died
Show your people, show your people how we died

We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
No need to nullify
No need to nullify
No need to nullify
We don't need to nullify
Die
We don't need to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We don't need to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We don't need to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We don't need to

Ask your people, ask your people what is right
Ask your people, ask your people what is right

We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
We don't need to multiply
No need to multiply
No need to multiply
No need to multiply
We don't need to multiply6Embed
