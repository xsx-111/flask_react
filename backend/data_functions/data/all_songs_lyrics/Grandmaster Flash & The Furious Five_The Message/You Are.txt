You Are LyricsYou have been so good to me
And you're very very wonderful
Lovely and beautiful to me
To me
The start of life is what I'm after
What does it take to capture
All the things
'Cause you're very very wonderful, yes you are
Lovely and beautiful to me, to me yeah
Yes, you're very very wonderful, yes you are lord
Lovely and beautiful to me, to me

You know, a lot of people don't realize it, but
Our lord, Jesus Christ, is the father
And everyone might not do the right thing in the father's eyes
But our father's very forgiving, and he loves everyone
And in this crazy mixed-up world of ours
Where things never seem to go right
As times goes on, we will have to surpass and overcome all these things
Which are negative and unjust
And I know that we will, and so does the father
God bless you all
Lovely and beautiful, to me
Yes, you're very very wonderful
Love, to me
Love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya
'Cause, very wonderful
Lovely and beautiful
To me, yes you are
To me, wooah yes, oh fatherEmbed
