Optimist LyricsWaiting, but I don't mind
I'm all bus stops and heat
I'm neon in your daylight
I'm the optimist of 30th street
How it is is how it oughta to be
I've got anything but moneyed esteem
The drinks on Cond√© Nast
I'm the optimist of 30th street
How it is is how it oughta to be
I spy Vivian Girls on the Up, Upper East
There's no reason to be upset
There's no reason to not expect
There's no room for emptiness
No tea or sympathy
There's no room for emptiness
On a never empty street2Embed
