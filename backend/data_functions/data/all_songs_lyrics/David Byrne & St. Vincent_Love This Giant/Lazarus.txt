Lazarus Lyrics
Hey, hey, Lazarus
Workin' your backbone, swingin' your shovel
Hey, hey, Lazarus
Gold in your river, there forever

One of these days I'm gonna bring that hammer down (cool water)
I'm workin' hard but my heart is wearing out (cool water)

Hey, hey, Lazarus
Workin' your backbone, swingin' that axe home
Hey, hey, Lazarus
Gold in your river, there forever

The captain's bell it swings from side to side (cool water)
High on this hill I'm working all the time (cool water)
My hammer comes down hard on ev'ryone (cool water)
I'll bring it down until my work is done (cool water)

Hey, hey, Lazarus
Water won't do, too deep was the stain
Paleolithic hunters sang this song (cool water)
To give them strength to work the whole day long (cool water)
I am the tramp slumped in your doorway
I didn't come to set you free
One of these days when all my work is done (cool water)
I'm gonna rest in the lap of Abraham (cool water)
You will not see my face come morning
I didn't come to set you freeEmbed
