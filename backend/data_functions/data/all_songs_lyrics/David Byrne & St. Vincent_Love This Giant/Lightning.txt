Lightning LyricsThere's a funny lightning
Threatening with striking
But it moves too quick for a picture
There's a funny lightning
'Round the corner hiding
But I'm too smart just to catch it
With gloves and rubber
So I stay put right here
Watching the sky for tears
Let the fools and cowboys roar to wrecks
But if I should wake up and find my home's in half
Who is it? Blame nature, I guess I have to laugh
And if I should wake up and find my bed has moved
Six inches, six closer to the west
But this funny lightning
I wanna invite in
If I could learn how to teach it
I salt the corners of
My room because, because
A ghost can never be too careful
And if I should wake up and find my home's in half
Who did it? Oh, nature, I hope you have a laugh
And if I should wake up and find my bed has moved
Twelve inches, twelve closer to my god
Whip crash, there's a flash and I'm back to wanting more
The crack is movin' up the wall
Whip crash, there's a flash and I'm back to wanting more
I can't help thinking this is war
