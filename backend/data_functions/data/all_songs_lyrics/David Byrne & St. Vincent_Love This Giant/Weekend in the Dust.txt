Weekend in the Dust LyricsOnce so mysterious
Now decoded and used
Now according to you, you
What's so mysterious?
Once so mysterious
Now decoded and used
Now according to you, you
What's so mysterious?
Wear it well, well, you have worn it out
Give it all, well, could you give it up?
Where's the fun in holding all the cards?
Everyone gets up when you sit down

I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
When the party's over we can call the dog
Dare to keep our shirts on rolling in the muck
Weekend in the dust
Weak and full of blood
If you're real, I'll be a hologram
Why have none when you can have it all?

I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don't
I don't get it, just don't get it
I don't get it, just don'tEmbed
