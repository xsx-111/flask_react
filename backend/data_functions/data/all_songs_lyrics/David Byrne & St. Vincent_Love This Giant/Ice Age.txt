Ice Age Lyrics
Oh, diamond, how we've been?
Oh, diamond, it's such a shame
To see you this way, freezing it out
Your own little ice age

Ice age
Ice age

Oh, diamond, get outta bed
All unbuttoned, seams are showing
And you're freaking me out, freezing it out
Your own little ice age

Ice age
Ice age
Ice age
Ice age


We won't know how much we've lost
Until the winter thaws
We won't know just what we lost
Until your winter thaws
Oh, diamond, where have you been?
It's close to your bones, it's far from your shell
So feel it away, reason it out
Your own little ice age

(Hey, Hey)
Thaw me out, Thaw me out
(Hey, Hey)
Thaw me out, Thaw me out (x3)1Embed
