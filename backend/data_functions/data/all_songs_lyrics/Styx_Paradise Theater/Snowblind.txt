Snowblind Lyrics
Mirror, mirror on the wall
The face you've shown me scares me so
Thought that I could call your bluff
But now the lines are clear enough
Life's not pretty, even though
I tried so hard to make it so
Mornings are such cold distress
How did I ever get into this mess

Now I'm snowblind
Can't live without you
'Cause you're so fine, I just can't get away
Yes, I'm snowblind, snowblind, snowblind

Harmless and innocent, you devil in white
You stole my will without a fight
You filled me with confidence, but you blinded my eyes
You tricked me with visions of paradise

Now I realize I'm snowblind
Can't live without you
'Cause you're so fine, I can't get away
Yes, I'm snowblind, snowblind, snowblind
Well, baby, I'm snowblind
Can't live without you
'Cause you're so fine, I just can't get away
Yes, I'm snowblind, snowblind, snowblind

Mirror, mirror, I confess
I can't escape this emptiness
No more reasons to pretend
Here comes that same old feeling again

Yes, I'm snowblind
Can't live without you
'Cause you're so fine, I just can't get away
Won't you throw me a lifeline
I'm going down for the third time
'Cause I'm snowblind, and I can't get away
Yes, I'm snowblind, snowblind, snowblind1Embed
