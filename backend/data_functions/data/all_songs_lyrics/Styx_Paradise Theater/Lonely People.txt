Lonely People Lyrics
Hey , hey out there knock it off will ya?
Hey give it a rest will ya? I'm tryin' to get some sleep!
Want me to call the cops?
I tell ya Erma I can't till next week when they start to tear that damn old theatre down

The rain was hot, the streets were empty
As downtown closed her eyes
The movie house stood in silence as I said my last good-byes
Her silver screen was stained with memories
As Cagney shot them down
And as I watched I was that hero
In dreamlands lost and found

Oh my god, well we both are empty
Paradise and me
Do you believe I'm still chasing rainbows
When everywhere I see

Lonely people, lonely people
Up above these ghetto streets
In penthouse suites they sit and stare
Lonely people, lonely people
They smile and say they're fine
But behind their eyes they just don't care
Lonely people
They just don't care
Lonely people, lonely people
Lonely people, lonely people
Beneath these neon streets in subway seats they crowd for air
Lonely people, lonely people
So close and yet so far they share the secrets of despair
Lonely people, lonely people (repeat and fade...)Embed
