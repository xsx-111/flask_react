Dog Problems LyricsDon't you dare
Speak for someone you don't know
They'll feel it in the back of their throat
We know I can't construct a poem
'Cause words, like girls, get bored and run
C'est la vie, I say "I've got so many better things"
I've got nothin', you should see me
I smoke myself to sleep
And blame postmodern things I can't relate
Like summer camp in coastal states
Like alcohol and coffee beans
Dance floors and magazines
I think it's safe to say I've only
Got myself to blame, but boys in
Swooping haircuts are bringing me down
Taking pictures of themselves
Oh
And so I
Walk the web in search of love
But always seem to end up stuck
I'm finding flaws in everyone
I've reached the point where all I want is
To sleep around in hopes that I will
Catch back up, we are
Parallel lines, we're running in circles
We're never meant to cross
I'm at a loss, you were my tangerine
My pussycat, my trampoline
Now alls I gets are wincing cheeks
And dog problems, I signed a lease
Thinking my heart belonged at
93rd and Park, instead I
Broke a girl's heart and flew back to Phoenix
To finish the year as it started
Can you hear me, are you listenin'?
This is the sound of my heart breaking
And I hope it's entertaining
Cause for me it's a bitch
Was it worth it when you slept with him?
Did you get it all
Out of your system?
I am a man holding it all
I couldn't breathe, coming across
I didn't know I couldn't give up
"B" is for believing you'd
Always be here for me
"E" is for everything
Even when we see it through
"C," "C" is for seein' through you
You are a fake, which brings me to
"A" because, because
You always run away
I never finish phrases, I misspell
Open arms are prison cells
When I said I hate what I've become
I lied, I hated who I was
So when you start to wonder about
The pain in my throat, well don't
You ever, no never, ever speak
For someone you don't know1Embed
