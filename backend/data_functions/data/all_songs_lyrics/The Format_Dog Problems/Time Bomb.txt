Time Bomb LyricsOh no, was it worth it?

Starting now I'm starting over
I'm gonna sleep
With the next person I meet
Starting now I'm starting over
You swore "together forever"
Now you're telling lies
Tell me your words have got
No concept of time

Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby
Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby
Oh no, was it worth it?
Was it worth what you did to big business?
Was it worth what your friends put up their noses?

Starting now I'm starting over (stop it)
Tell the new wave kids their make-up kits
Can find me where self pity gets
A breath of fresh air
Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby
Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby

You set the watch
You're just in time
To wreck my life
To bring back what I left behind

Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby
Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby

Five years and you fell for a waiter
I'm sure he says he's an actor
So you're acting like
(you never tried to take your life)
So starting now I'm starting over
I'm throwing bottles
I'm taking showers
I'm going to sleep
I'm going to sleep
Starting now I'm starting over (stop it)
Starting now I'm starting over (stop it)
To play the game
Get even
Act my age

Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby
Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby

You set the watch
You're just in time
To wreck my life
To bring back what I left behind

Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby
Tick tock, you're not a clock
You're a time bomb baby
Oh no, was it worth what you
Did to your wrists?Embed
