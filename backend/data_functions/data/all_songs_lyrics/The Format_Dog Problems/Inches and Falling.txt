Inches and Falling LyricsI love love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
Take these tattered boxes
That used to hold your clothes
Break them down
Build them back up with your bones
All you did was construct a mess
You're good to me when only flesh
You're a memory with nothing to show
When we would take trips
We swore we'd never take pictures
Pictures only prove what you can't convince
Now I wish those photographs
Could convince you that what we had
Would only turn out a negative
Well
Well
Well
If fingertips are relationships
Then I could barely carry your weight
If fingers are mistakes
Don't use this one to point the blame
Just sing
Sing
I love love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
These pills are fine to pass the time
'til I find my new drug
Then
We'll take our chances
We'll last a month
We'll never speak again
How I love being in love
And don't pick up that line
You're dressed to have a good time
You don't need him, you need to be seen
So someone else can treat you wrong
So you my love can sing this song
I love love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
These pills are fine to pass the time
'til I find my new drug
Then
We'll take advantage
I'll claim that's what I want
To be the new statistic
How I love
How I love
How I love being in love
Take these tattered boxes
That used to hold your clothes
Break them down
Build them back up with your bones
All you did was construct a mess
You're dead to me if love is death
You're a memory with nothing to show
Well
Well
Well
If fingertips are relationships
Then maybe I could use a break
She smiles
She points at me
She says
"Baby I love how you sing
So just sing
Sing"
I love love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
I love love
I love being in love
I don't care what it does to me
These pills are fine to pass the time
'til I find my new drug
Then
We'll take our chances
We'll rise above
We'll last until the end
How I love
How I love
How I love being in loveEmbed
