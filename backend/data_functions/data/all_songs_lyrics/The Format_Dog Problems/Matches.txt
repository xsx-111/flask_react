Matches LyricsAshes to ashes, dust on the dash
I got my cigarettes
But I can't find the fire
That's calming me down
I was just out on a night with my friends
You are still out on a night with your friends
And you don't seem to tire when I'm not around
I'm under the tunnel, I'm holding my breath
I searched every pocket that hung in the closet
Until I found some matches in a brown leather jacket
One I swore I'd never worn, but it once kept you warm
Do you remember we made love on the floor?
And you still haven't called
So I wait until they're closing the bars
I made a wish but the match never lit1Embed
