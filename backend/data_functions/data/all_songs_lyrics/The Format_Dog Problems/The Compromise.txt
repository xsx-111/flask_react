The Compromise Lyrics
You
You think it's cool to be crazy
I say you're born rich
Stay rich
There's no point in taking chances
And me
I wouldn't call it a sophomore slump
I'd say I'm one step closer to being just
Where I want
To be
Away from this scene
Away from this machine (alright!)

Meet me in the middle
C'mon let's make up a dance
And we'll agree to call it the compromise

Step one:
Find a partner
Grab a pen
Don't you dare ask questions
Just sign on the dotted line
Step two:
Throw your partner behind a desk
Where they'll do absolutely nothing
So it's your job to dance and smile
The whole time
Don't call it a trend
It's the only way we think to get ahead

Meet me in the middle
C'mon let's make up a dance
And we'll agree to call it the compromise
There's no sense in complaining
It doesn't change our minds
Take me by the hand
Let's compromise

I can feel your feet touching mine
If you can't dance
There's someone else in line
I can feel your feet touching mine
If you can't dance
There's someone else in line

Meet me in the middle
C'mon let's make up a dance
And we'll agree to call it the compromise
There's no sense in complaining
It doesn't change our minds
Take me by the hand
Let's compromiseEmbed
