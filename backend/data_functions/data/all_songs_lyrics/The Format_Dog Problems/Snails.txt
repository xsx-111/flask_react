Snails Lyrics
Nico come back home
Show me that you care
That love's not just a flare on my sleeve
Sleep well
I pray that cardboard boxes
Set the perfect stage
Cause wood grain makes
All man-made things
Seem so out of date
Life is not a play
It's what we make of the people we love

Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch
So why, why, why, why, why, why
Are you quick to kiss?
She bites at blades and leaves
Goddamn your shrubbery
I'm sick of vanity plates
Should we move to the UK?
Cause life here in the States has escaped
All the people above
Life's what we make
Of those people we love
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch
So why, why, why, why, why, why
Are you quick to kiss
Baby
Maybe I spoke too soon
I'll touch you once you make the first move
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch

I watch her as she runs
My mother jumps the gun
She puts her in her arms
That is just like my mom
Never lets go, never lets me grow old
I want to pay her back
But love is nothing you can tax
My family's not rich by any means
But I feel we won the lottery that day
The rock swallowed the girl
And I cried as cameras caught my eyes
My tears turned into butterflies
That fly away as caskets close
A new day comes
You'll wake unfold
And smile when you feel the sunlight
You feel the sunlight
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch
So why, why, why, why, why, why
Are you quick to kiss
Baby
Maybe I spoke too soon
I'll touch you once you make the first move
Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inch

Snails see the benefits
The beauty in every inchEmbed
