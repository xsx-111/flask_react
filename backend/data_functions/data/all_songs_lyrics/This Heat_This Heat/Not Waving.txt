Not Waving LyricsYes, I will go up there
Up there where I know you cannot find me
I held on to the steel rail too long now
I know I must let go
Here I am in the ocean
Not waving but drowning
Just a nervous reaction, please don't rescue me
So cold I can't feel my toes
Oh, let them go, who needs them?
Circulation stand-still
H2O can freeze you to the marrow
Learn to love the water
It will love you like there's no tomorrow
There is no tomorrow1Embed
