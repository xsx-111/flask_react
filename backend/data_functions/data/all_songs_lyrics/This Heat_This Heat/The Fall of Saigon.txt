The Fall of Saigon LyricsWe ate Soda, the embassy cat
Poor Soda's coda
No more da capo, she's decapitated
Running 'round the room, half-baked
The other half is bacon and sizzling in the frying pan
We ate the TV
We ate the armchair
We ate the telephone
We ate the styrofoam
My God how we got so far only to reach so low
The Russians saved the janitor
Soda was a little tough to eat
No wonder she was hard meat
Out on the roof with the feline goose
But Soda had a heart of gold
The ambassador's wife had the liver
"Please deliver us from evil," she cried
"I know all about cats and their heavy vibes"
She was a very hip ambassador's wife3Embed
