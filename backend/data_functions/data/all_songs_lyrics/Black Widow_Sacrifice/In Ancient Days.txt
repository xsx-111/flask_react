In Ancient Days LyricsIn ancient days, in other lives, long past but not forgotten
I’ve learned the power of mind and flesh to have my will obeyed
In Adonai and Babylon, Etruscans and Egyptians
Came to my temple, journeyed to the Valley of the Moon
Deep underground where no light dared to come beneath my pyramid
I stood in Hell, a mortal man between Belial and Satan
And still before my audience entrance with stark, cold fear
I cured or struck with sickness, death, or made insane my foes
Here in my thirteenth life the mystic power of old
Returns, and as I say these words, my soul again in Hell
I conjure thee, I conjure thee, I conjure thee, I conjure thee appear
I raise you mighty demon, come before me, join me here
In ancient days, in other lives, long past but not forgotten

I stood in Hell, a mortal man between Belial and Satan
And still before my audience entrance with stark, cold fear
I cured or struck with sickness, death, or made insane my foes
Here in my thirteenth life the mystic power of old
Returns, and as I say these words, my soul again in Hell
I conjure thee, I conjure thee, I conjure thee, I conjure thee appear
I raise you mighty demon, come before me, join me here
Deep underground where no light dared to come, beneath my pyramid
