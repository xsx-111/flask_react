Seduction LyricsYou asked me to come to you
Prayed to have me here
Here I am in human form
Take away my fear
Here I am, just as you wish
Though I fear you still
Can’t you tell just what you wish?
You can have your fill
Would you have me stay with you?
Squeeze and hold you tight?
Soothe you with my tongue and touch
Share your bed at night
Here I am, just as you wish
Though I fear you still
Can’t you tell just by my kiss?
You can have your fill
Here I stand, just as you wish
Now my fear is near
We can share our lovers’ tryst
You have had no fear
Never knew you’d be so warm
Ecstasy is near
I will move and you will fall
I have lost my fearEmbed
