Conjuration LyricsCould it be the voice I heard
Borne on the wind to reach my ears
Came from the lips I learned so well
In other lives, I swear that I will
Kill my fear, perform the rites
And spurred on by my need
To have the one I loved before
I'll even steel my heart to raise the devil himself
In this sacred place I stand
Unused for countless years
To make my dream come true I call
The lady Astaroth, come join me here
The time has come, the power is raised
The wind brings voices to my ears
"Believe, have faith" the voices say
"Have confidence, the time is almost right"
Can it be the voice I heard
Borne on the wind to reach my ears
Came from the lips I learned so well
In other lives, I swear that I will
Kill my fear, perform the rites
And spurred on by my need
To have the one I loved before
I'll even steel my heart to raise the devil himself
In this sacred place I stand
Unused for countless years
To make my dream come true I call
The lady Astaroth, come join me here
The time has come, the power is raised
The wind brings voices to my ears
"Believe, have faith" the voices say
"Have confidence, the time is almost right"1Embed
