Sacrifice LyricsA sacrifice, a sacrifice
You say you want a sacrifice
You say the words too easily
To know just what you mean
One black hand, one white hand
I’ll slaughter with your knife
I know full well you haven’t lost
A thing to match the blood
The sacrificial knife will stay once more
With hell on high
The blood is mixed within the cup
And drunk by all who watch
You cast yourselves a power in frenzy
Crazed to feel that touch
We’ll never get to power
Just by playing nasty games
A sacrifice, a sacrifice
You say you want a sacrifice
You say the words too easily
To know just what you mean
One black hand, one white hand
I’ll slaughter with your knife
I know full well you haven’t lost
A thing to match the blood
When I crossed the abyss
Two thousand years ago
I never knew I dreamed
So many powers I would reach
Till the point of my knife
Breaks my lover’s silken throat
The only thing I’ve sacrificed
Had been my father’s years
A sacrifice, a sacrifice
You say you want a sacrifice
You say the words too easily
To know just what you mean
One black hand, one white hand
I’ll slaughter with your knife
I know full well you haven’t lost
A thing to match the bloodEmbed
