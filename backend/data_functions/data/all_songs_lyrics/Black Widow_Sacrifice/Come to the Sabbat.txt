Come to the Sabbat LyricsHelp me in my search for knowledge
I must learn the secret art
Who dares to help me raise the one
Whose very name sears my heart
Astaroth
Discard your clothes and come on foot
Through streams and fields and moonlit moors
Your body soaked in secret oils
Perfumed herbs will heal your sores
Join me in my search for power
Wives and husbands bring your kin
We’ll be as one within the hour
Let the Sabbat now begin
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Discard your clothes and come on foot
Through streams and fields and moonlit moors
Your body soaked in secret oils
Perfumed herbs will heal your sores
Join me in my search for power
Wives and husbands bring your kin
We’ll be as one within the hour
Let the Sabbat now begin
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Come, come, come to the Sabbat
Come to the Sabbat, Satan’s there
Help me in my search for knowledge
I must learn the secret art
Who dares to help me raise the one
Whose very name stills my heart
