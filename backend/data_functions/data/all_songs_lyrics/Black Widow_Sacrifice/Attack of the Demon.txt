Attack of the Demon LyricsYou played a game for rich rewards
The stakes: your blood, your mind, your soul
You try to gain all earthly power
You unleash plagues of Famine, Death and War
All my sins have damned my soul in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
I tried to turn my heart against the wickedness I caused
And in my dream my dear, beloved mother came to me
She begged me turn my face, once more, up high towards the Lord
But notice came, I could not weep for Satan clutched my heart
All my sins have damned my soul in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
You played a game for rich rewards
The stakes: your blood, your mind, your soul
You try to gain all earthly power
You unleash plagues of Famine, Death and War
All my sins have damned my soul in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hell
All of my sins have left me in hellEmbed
