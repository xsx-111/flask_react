Way to Power LyricsHave you ever read the books that I wrote centuries ago?
The Clavicules of Solomon is nothing by their side
It lays bare secret arts that stood the ravages of time
And practices, once more exposed, that everyone should know
You play with blood and hair and sweat and ends of fingernails
The very things to do the deeds our Brotherhood demands
You cast, with mirrors, dolls in wax; the spells you learned by heart
Fool, you are, lash up storms, lightning, rain and gales
I urge you now to find my books, read the tales and spells
Let’s turn the whole world upside down, confusion everywhere
The Four of the Apocalypse on horseback ever wait
The Talisman of Set was mine, the Horsemen did my bidding
I urge you now to find my books, read the tales and spells
Let’s turn the whole world upside down, confusion everywhere
The Four of the Apocalypse on horseback ever wait
The Talisman of Set was mine, the Horsemen did my bidding
The lady of the moon, my bride; Astaroth, her name
Side by side we wove the spells that drove mere men insane
Get the hence and scour the world, seek and you shall find
Read my books and learn from them, power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gain
Power you shall gainEmbed
