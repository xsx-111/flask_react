Cars Are Cars LyricsCars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Similarly made, similarly sold
In a motorcade, abandoned when they're old
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Engine in the front, jack in the back
Wheels take the brunt, pinion and a rack
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
But people are strangers, they change with the curve
From time zone to time zone as we can observe
They shut down their borders and think they're immune
They stand on their differences and shoot at the moon
But cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Drive 'em on the left, drive 'em on the right
Susceptible to theft in the middle of the night
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
I once had a car that was more like a home
I lived in it, loved in It, polished its chrome
If some of my homes had been more like my car
I probably wouldn't have traveled this far
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the world
Cars are cars all over the worldEmbed
