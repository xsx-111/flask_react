Allergies Lyrics
(Maladies)
Uh, melodies
Allergies to dust and grain
Maladies
Remedies
Still these allergies remain

My hands can't touch a guitar string
My fingers just burn and ache
My head intercedes with my bodily needs
And my body won't give it a break
My heart can stand a disaster
My heart can take a disgrace
But my heart is allergic to the women I love
And it's changing the shape of my face

Allergies
Allergies
Something's living on my skin
Doctor, please
Doctor, please
Open up, it's me again
But I go to a famous physician
I sleep in the local hotel
From what I can see of the people like me
We get better, but we never get well
So I ask myself this question
It's a question I often repeat
Where do allergies go when it's after a show
And they wanna get something to eat?

Allergies
Allergies
Something's living on my skin
Doctor, please
Doctor, please
Open up, it's me again

Maladies
Melodies
Allergies to dust and grain
Maladies
Remedies
Still these allergies remain
I can't breathe


Allergies
Allergies
Something's living on my skin
Doctor, please
Doctor, please
Open up, it's me again
