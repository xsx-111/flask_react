Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog After the War LyricsRene and Georgette Magritte with their dog after the war
Returned to their hotel suite and they unlocked the door
Easily losing their evening clothes
They dance by the light of the moon

To the Penguins, the Moonglows
The Orioles and the Five Satins
The deep forbidden music they'd been longing for
Rene and Georgette Magritte with their dog after the war
Rene and Georgette Magritte with their dog after the war
Were strolling down Christopher Street when they stopped in a men's store
With all of the mannequins dressed in the style
That brought tears to their immigrant eyes

Just like the Penguins, the Moonglows
The Orioles and the Five Satins
The easy stream of laughter flowing through the air
Rene and Georgette Magritte with their dog apr√®s la guerre
Side by side they fell asleep
Decades gliding by like Indians, time is cheap
When they wake up they will find
All their personal belongings have intertwined
Rene and Georgette Magritte with their dog after the war
Were dining with the power elite and they looked in their bedroom door
And what do you think they have hidden away
In the cabinet cold of their hearts?

The Penguins, the Moonglows
The Orioles and the Five Satins
For now and ever after as it was before
Rene and Georgette Magritte with their dog after the war1Embed
