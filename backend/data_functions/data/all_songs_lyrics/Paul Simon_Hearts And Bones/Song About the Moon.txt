Song About the Moon LyricsIf you want to write a song about the moon
Walk along the craters of the afternoon
When the shadows are deep and the light is alien
And gravity leaps like a knife off the pavement
And you want to write a song about the moon
You want to write a spiritual tune
Then nah nah nah yeah, presto
A song about the moon
If you want to write a song about the heart
Think about the moon before you start
Because the heart will howl like a dog in the moonlight
And the heart can explode like a pistol on a June night
So if you want to write a song about the heart
And its ever-longing for a counterpart
Then nah nah nah nah yea yeah yeah
Write a song about the moon
The laughing boy, he laughed so hard
He fell down from his place
The laughing girl, she laughed so hard
That tears rolled down her face
Hey songwriter
If you want to write a song about a face
Think about a photograph
That you really can't remember but you can't erase
Wash your hands in dreams and lightning
Cut off your hair and whatever is frightening
If you want to write a song about a face
If you want to write a song about the human race
Then nah nah nah nah yeah yeah
Write a song about the moon
If you want to write a song about the moon
You want to write a spiritual tune
Nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah yeah yeah, then do it
Write a song about the moonEmbed
