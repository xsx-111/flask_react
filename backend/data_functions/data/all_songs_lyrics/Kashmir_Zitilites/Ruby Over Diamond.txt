Ruby Over Diamond LyricsWhat a wonder
It is to see you
What a wonder
It is to feel you
I found your hideout
In the rubble
Where you can cry out
When you're in trouble
Now I want to be
In your hide and seek
Now I want to make children
Do I scare you
Or make you frightened
Don't you dare to move
The rope's will tighten
Is it over
Does it hurt you
All I wanted was
To divert you
Now I want to be
In your hide and seek
Now I want to make
Love to, love to, love to you
You're the glacier
I'm the bonfire
You're the treasure
That I desire
You're the ruby
Over diamonds
Shy and moody
You're a wonder
