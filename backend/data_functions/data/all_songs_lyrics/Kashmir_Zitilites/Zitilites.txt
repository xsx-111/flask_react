Zitilites LyricsMeet me in
The parking lot
Pretend that
You don't know
What for
The deepest end
And the dimmest light
The cheap dress
And the high heels
That I love
Where it's at
The city lights
Where faces
Slightly alter
I'm so impressed
By your patience, girl
With all that
Noise between us
It's not the end
The end of us
When I say
That I cannot die
For you
This is it
The city lights
Where faces
So slightly alter
Where it's at
The city lights
Where faces
So slightly alterEmbed
