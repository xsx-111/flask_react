The Aftermath Lyrics
I'm wondering if my thoughts of her
Have ever crossed her thoughts of me
And if they're half as clear as mine
And if there'll ever be a time
For us to journey once again
As lovers and as trusted friends
What if the best is yet to come
And this was only the first part run

Get a hold of yourself
Don't worry about the aftermath
There is no one after you
Or on your back
Get a hold of yourself
Don't worry about the aftermath
There is no one after you
There is no one after you
There is no one after you

But the everyday just can't compete
With the beauty of a polaroid
Where the fairytale endures complete
And her eyes are always full of joy
Like a frozen glimpse of butterflies
On a colourized celluloid sky
She waves her cheerful last goodbye
And begs for me to let past things slide
Get a hold of yourself
And don't worry about the aftermath
Cause there is no one after you
No one on your back
Get a hold of yourself
And don't worry about the aftermath
There is no one after you
There is no one after you1Embed
