The New Gold Lyrics
We're all prosperous and proud to be
With our holiday photos and our tickets for speed
Kitchens installed for a family
And once in a while for making love
Look at her eyes, they're so eager and dead
As she dances for you, more than ready for bed
But it's alright on a Tuesday night
To drink up and hit it at five

Its the new gold in fact
It will keep us all intact
As long as our eyes are all closed
To the coals that we just fled
You can relax
Cause were safe behind
Behind the bush

We're in love, we're all occupied
With our 200 lovers in a fast moving line
It's a need you cannot deny
It's something to straighten your spine
Now we know the grim reaper's on our side
We can turn to the papers and watch for the fight
Man it's warm lets just sleep outside
And see how the sky reflects our fire
It's the new gold in fact
It will keep us all intact
As long as our eyes all are closed
To the coals that we just fled
It's the new gold in fact
That can keep us all intact
As long as our eyes are all closed
To the coals that we just fled
You can relax
Cause it's far away
We're safe behind
Behind the bushEmbed
