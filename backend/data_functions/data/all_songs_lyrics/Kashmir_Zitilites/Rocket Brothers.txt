Rocket Brothers Lyrics
I miss you so much boy
Will we be coming on again
Don't ever loose your ropes
This man is hanging by the ends
I owe you so much time
Yes you might say it isn't like that at all

But now it's coming back to you
These open moments that I blew

Rocket brothers crack and burst
If they can't meet upon the verge
Of breaking into separate parts
That was not written in our cards
Now you got someone to protect
Someone you cannot reject

I miss you so much boy
But I was buried in the mines
I found it hard to stop
You found me very hard to find
But now that you've made way
I'd better tie together these ropes again
And throw the times right back to you
And all the chances that I blew

Rocket brothers crack and burst
If they can't meet upon the verge
Of breaking into separate parts
That was not written in our cards
Those rocket brothers on the verge
We should be careful 'cause it could burst
And we're not lonely any more
Lonely as we were before
And now there is someone to protect
Someone you cannot reject
Something I will not neglect
