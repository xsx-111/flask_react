In the Sand Lyrics
Sometimes the girl is here
With her indigo eyes
And her brand new gear
She won't stay for long
And she has to walk straight home
Patience, time comes, she says
Kiss me but don't you tell
This is over as soon as this fire burns through

She's on the ocean
He's in the sand
She's stuck in motion
He is sliding gently off her hand

Springtime and turmoil
She pours white wine
And gets herself lost
She falls over
And disappears into the meadows
Wayward and highstrung
She is lovesick and ever so strong
Then it's over like none of it ever was real
She's on the ocean
He's in the sand
She's stuck in motion
He slides so gently off her hand4Embed
