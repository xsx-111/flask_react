Surfing the Warm Industry Lyrics
I wanna run from the apathy
From the questioning tongues
And eyes that just won't come off
And get a job in a industry
Where a smile's not required
And complaints are always the same

Cause baby you must be so fed up
With a boy that keeps telling you
How much good he's gonna do
When all that is happening 'round here
Is happening in here
And nothing gets out there
Except for the truth

It's up to you
Cause I'm absolutely numb
It's up to you
Cause I'm absolutely numb

I've been adrift on the silver surf
And I've paddled ahead of the fear
That I'd fall behind
I took drinks from the glitter smurfs
And their company dads who never
Stood by in the crying
Cause no one does and nobody ever will
There is only space for one
And surely he gets killed
When the engine seizes up
You might call it existential crisis
I simply call it the bravery
Of emptiness

It's up to you
Cause I'm absolutely numb
It's up to you
Cause I'm absolutely numb2Embed
