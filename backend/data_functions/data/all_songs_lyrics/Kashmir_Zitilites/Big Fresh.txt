Big Fresh LyricsI pick you up on monday morning
In the street
And all you have to do is fall
Into the seat
Now the time has come for us
Time for us to go
Turn ourselves over to the unseen
The map will snore
In it's glove compartment
As we pass
And we don't stop until the last ends
Except for gas
Now the time has come for us
Time for us to go
Turn ourselves over to the unseen
Big fresh
Big fresh
Where's your lively
Big fresh
Big fresh
Where's your smileyEmbed
