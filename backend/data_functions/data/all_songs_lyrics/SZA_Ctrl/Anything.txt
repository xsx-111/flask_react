Anything Lyrics
Maybe I should kill my inhibition
Maybe I'll be perfect in a new dimension

Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson ooh

Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do do do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will

Keepin' up is hard to do
Even harder feeling heavy, steady chasin' you
Beep beep, why are you lookin' around, you lonely?
I feel you comin' down like honey
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I

Maybe I should pray a little harder
Or work a little smarter
This time baby promise I have learned my lesson ooh
Down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
Do do do down for the ride, down for the ride
You could take me anywhere
I hope you will, I hope you will, I hope you will

Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do do you even know I'm alive?
Do do you even know I, I
Do you know I'm alive?
Do you even know?24Embed
