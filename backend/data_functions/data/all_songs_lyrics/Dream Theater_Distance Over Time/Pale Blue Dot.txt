Pale Blue Dot Lyrics

So far away from home, beyond a distant reach
Faint whispers from the edge, returning piece by piece
A lonely point of light, captured in a final glance
A solitary hint of life, discovered if by chance

God creators, dream destroyers
Spineless cowards and fearless warriors
Hopeful children, mothers and fathers
Our blood-filled rivers fueled by hate
We worship heroes, kings and saints
But who's out there to save us from ourselves?

All you will ever know, all life that ever was
All you despise or love, living out their lives
This isolated speck, hurtling through the cosmic dark
Would seem to go astray if we were washed away

God creators, dream destroyers
Knowledge seekers and bold explorers
Hopeful children, mothers and fathers
All on this place we call our home
Adrift in space, we're on our own
But who's out there to save us from ourselves?5Embed
