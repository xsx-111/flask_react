Fall into the Light Lyrics

Written on the water, memories dissipate
Eyes begin to open, darkness drifts away
Time and space, like roses whose petals drop and fade
And fall into the light as if dreams of yesterday

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see

There is nothing sacred, only heaven knows
So turn towards the sun and look into your soul

Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
It's become so clear to me


Too much love is not enough for us
I was once too blind to see
Too much hope will never be enough
The truth is clear to me
