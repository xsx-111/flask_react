Paralyzed Lyrics

The anger, the pressure
You're choking down your words again
Feel the nerves set in
Unspoken frustration
They see right through you
Paper thin, like the ghost within

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed

The stare of a stranger
Is like a wound that bleeds again
Silent as the dead
The victim, the martyr
Like Daniel in the lion's den
Time and time again

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed, I am paralyzed

A heart that feels no pain
Addicted to the game
Relentless mental drain
What do you stand to gain?
Viewing life through such a narrow, fractured lens
Will ensure you end up on the losing end
Breaking beneath the strain
I am paralyzed, I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed, I am paralyzed
I am paralyzed4Embed
