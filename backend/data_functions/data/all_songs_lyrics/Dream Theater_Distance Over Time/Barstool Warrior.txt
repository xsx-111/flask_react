Barstool Warrior Lyrics

In a dark and lonely corner
Of a time-worn dockside inn
Sits the local barstool warrior
Talking to his gin
Tracing past decisions
He motions for a shot
Is he doomed to be a man this world forgot?
Just a prisoner of the monster on his back

Call it bad luck, call it fate
Call it stuck here the rest of my days
Serves me right
What went wrong?
And where do I belong?

In the glow of flashing lights
On the shoulder of the road
Clutching at the bruises on her skin
She tries to signal danger
With anguish in her eyes
Will he see the world of pain she's in?
Or is it too late?
Was it bad luck? Was it fate?
Or a past that she couldn't escape?
It's not right, something's wrong
Just where do I belong?


Promises made, crying in vain, all empty
Never accepting the blame
And not letting go of the shame
A river of tears as months turn to years, all wasted
On someone not willing to change
Now only a shadow remains
No one can save you
And there's no one to save
It has been written
You will become all you think
All you feel, all you dream

Now I'm cutting the anchor away
And I won't look back
I'm starting a new life today
Now I see where I belong10Embed
