S2N Lyrics
Are we paying attention
Or are we drifting?
Too much negative action
Not enough positive reaction

What's the state of humanity?
Where's the peace and the harmony?
Free the signal, your inner voice
Time to transcend, block out the noise

Signal to noise becomes the answer
The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel

Have you heard the news?
A surging sea of circumstance
Pain, starvation, war, abuse
Sterile gloves hide dirty hands

Shocking truth, climate change
Floods and fires, hurricanes
Overdose, suicide
Innocent die
Fear and race, endless lies
Sex and faith; terrorize
Drugs and guns; taking lives
Innocent die

Signal to noise becomes the answer
The world keeps turning as we latch onto the wheel
Signal to noise defines the reason
The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel
Our wounds begin to heal

(Wow)

Signal to noise becomes the answer
The world keeps turning as we latch onto the wheel
Signal to noise defines the reason
The world keeps turning as we latch on to the wheel
Our wounds begin to heal
The chatter disappears and the message is revealed
