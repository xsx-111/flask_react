Untethered Angel Lyrics
You've built this world around you, your universe
In spite of best intentions, things could not be worse
Chaos and fear have left you hanging by a thread
As you argue with the voice inside your head

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself won't set you free

Misgiving and dismay, nightmares of wasted days
Can't live your life this way, something needs to change
Cold feet and second thoughts; entangled, tied in knots
Avoidance at all costs, a painful thing to watch

Fear can live inside you
Push you to the edge
Face the fear within you
Wake up from the dead

Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Giving up yourself won't set you free
Set you free
Untethered angel
Falling into darkness
Don't be afraid of letting go
Open your heart, be set free7Embed
