Plastic People LyricsFZ: Ladies and gentlemen the president of the United States
RC as the President: Fellow Americans
FZ: He’s been sick. I think his wife will bring us some chicken soup

Plastic people
Oh baby how you’re such a drag
FZ: I know it’s hard to defend such unpopular policy every once in awhile

Plastic people
Oh baby how you’re such a drag
FZ: There’s this guy from the CIA and he’s creeping around Laurel canyon

Fine little girl
She waits for me
She’s as plastic
As she can be
She paints her face
With plastic goo
And wrecks her hair
With some shampoo
Plastic people
Oh baby how you’re such a drag
FZ: I don’t know, sometimes I just get tired of ya honey
It’s a your hairspray or somethin'

Plastic people
Oh baby you’re such a drag
FZ: I here the sound of marching feet down Sunset boulevard to Crescent heights and there at Pandora’s Box we are confronted with a vast quantity of plastic people

Take a day
And walk around
Watch the Nazi’s
Run your town
Then go home and check yourself
You think we're singing 'bout someone else...
But you’re plastic people
Now baby you’re such a drag


Me see a neon
Moon above
I searched for years
I found no love
I’m sure that love
Will never be
A product of
Plasticity
RC: Plastic people are; your foot, your hair, your nose, your arm. You eat, suck, your being is you plastic people. Blah blah blah. Plastic pebbles
(some Spanish cannot make out)
FZ: A prune is not a vegetable. Cabbage is a vegetable1Embed
