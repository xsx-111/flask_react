Big Leg Emma LyricsThere's a big dilemma
About my Big Leg Emma, uh-huh, oh yeah
There's a big dilemma
About my Big Leg Emma, uh-huh, oh yeah
She was my steady date
Until she put on weight
There's a big dilemma
About my Big Leg Emma, uh-huh, oh yeah
There's a big dilemma
About my Big Leg Emma, uh-huh, oh yeah
She used to knock me out
Until her face broke out
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma My Emma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma My Emma
Sock it to me
There's a big dilemma
About my Big Leg Emma, uh-huh, oh yeah
There's a big dilemma
About my Big Leg Emma, uh-huh, oh yeah
She used to knock me out
Until her face broke outEmbed
