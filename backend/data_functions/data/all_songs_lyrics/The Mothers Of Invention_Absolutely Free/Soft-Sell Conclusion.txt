Soft-Sell Conclusion LyricsA lot of people don't bother about their friends in the Vegetable Kingdom
They think, "Ah, what can I say? What can a person like myself say to a vegetable?"
But the answer is simple, my friends...
Just call, and tell them how you feel
About muffins, pumpkins
Wax paper, caledonia, mahoganies, elbows
And green things in general
And soon: a new rapport!
You and your new little green & yellow buddies
Grooving together! Oh no!
Maintaining your coolness together!
Worshipping together in the church of your choice!
Only in America! Woh-oh-oh-ah-agh-h

Call any vegetable
Call it by name
You gotta call one today
When you get off the train

Call any vegetable
And the chances are good
Ahr, that the vegetable will respond to you

Oh no! Can you see them responding?
The pumpkin is breathing hard:
Huffa puffa huffa puffa
What a pumpkinEmbed
