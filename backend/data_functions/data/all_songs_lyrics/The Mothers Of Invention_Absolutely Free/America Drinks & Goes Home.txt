America Drinks & Goes Home Lyrics(Here's a special request)
(Hope you enjoy it)
I tried to find
How my heart
Could be so blind
Dear
How could I be fooled
Just like the rest
You came on strong
With your fast car and your class ring
Soft voice and your sad eyes
I fell for the whole thing
I don't regret
Having met
Up with a girl who
Breaks hearts like they were
Nothing at all
I've done it too
Now I
Know just what it feels like
And just like I said
There's no regrets
(Well, it's about time to close)
(I hope you've had as much fun as we have)
(Don't forget there's, jam session Sunday)
(Mandy Tension will be by, playing his xylophone troupe)
(It's really been a lot of fun)
(Monday night's dance contest night, the Twist contest)
(We're gonna give away peanut butter jelly and baloney sammiches for all of you)
(It really has been fun)
(I hope we've played your requests)
(The songs you like to hear)
(Last call for alcohol! Drink it up, folks)
(Wonderful)
(Nice to see you, Bob. How's it goin'? How's the kids?)
(Wonderful. Nice to see you. Yes)
(Oh, Bill Bailey? Oh. We'll get to that tomorrow night. Yeah)
(Caravan with a drum solo? Right. Yeah. We'll do that)
(Wonderful. Nice to see you again. Yeah)
La la la
Down at the Pompadour A-Go-Go
Vo do dee oh pee pee
Shooby-doot-n-dah-dah-dah
Ya da da-ah!
Na nya da da da da dah!
Night, all!Embed
