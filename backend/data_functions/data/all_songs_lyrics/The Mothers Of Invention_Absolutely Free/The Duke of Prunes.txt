The Duke of Prunes LyricsA moon beam through the prune in June
Reveals your chest I see your lovely beans
And in that magic go-kart I bite your neck
The cheese I have for you, my dear
Is real and very new
A moon beam through the prune in June
Reveals your chest I see your lovely beans
And in that magic go-kart I bite your neck
The love I have for you, my dear
Is real and very new
Prune (pa-da-dah)
If it is a real prune
Knows no cheese (cheeky chanky, cheeky chanky)
And stands, oh no
Taller or softer than any tree or bush
And I know the love I have for you
Will grow and grow and grow, I think
And so my love, I offer you
A love that is strong, a prune that is trueEmbed
