Call Any Vegetable Lyrics
This is a song about vegetables, they keep ya regular
They're real good for you

Call any vegetable
Call it by name
Call one today
When you get off the train

Call any vegetable
And the chances are good
Aw, the vegetable will respond to you

Some people don't go for prunes...I don't know
I've always found that if they-

Call any vegetable
Pick up your phone
Think of a vegetable
Lonely at home

Call any vegetable
And the chances are good
That a vegetable will respond to you
Rutabaga, rutabaga
Rutabaga, rutabaga
Rutabay-y-y-y...
A prune isn't really a vegetable...
Cabbage is a vegetable...
No one will know
If you don't want to let them know
No one will know
'Less it's you that might tell them so
Call and they'll come to you
Covered with dew
Vegetables dream of responding to you
Standing there shiny and proud by your side
Holding your hand while the neighbors decide
Why is a vegetable something to hide?Embed
