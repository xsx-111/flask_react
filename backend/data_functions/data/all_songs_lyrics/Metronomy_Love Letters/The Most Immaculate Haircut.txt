The Most Immaculate Haircut Lyrics
He's got the most immaculate haircut
But with the right dye and shampoo
Maybe I could too
And he's got the most desirable friendship group
But boy, while you've got that hairdo
They're not gonna call you
Now we've got to get together and make some amends
I see the girl's falling for you
How she must adore you
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh

I get this feeling in my bones sometimes
It's like my legs might fall away
A shooting pain runs down my left-hand side
And I, I think of you

Oh, hush now
Don't have a baby
Look at what you gave me
We can always grow, you know
Oh, hush now
Don't have a baby
Look at what you gave me
We can always grow together

I get this feeling in my bones sometimes
It's like my legs might fall away
A shooting pain runs down my left-hand side
And I, I think of you

Oh, hush now
Don't have a baby
Look at what you gave me
We can always grow, you know
Oh, hush now
Don't have a baby
Look at what you gave me
We can always grow, you know

Oh, hush now
Oh, hush now
Oh, hush now
Oh, hush now1Embed
