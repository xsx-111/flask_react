Call Me Lyrics
Call it as you see, call it what you like
Call it you and me, call it anything
Only wrong to do, saw it from afar
Coming into view, call it anything
Call it your friend, but everyone's your friend
Only if they say, "Call up on me"
We all need company
Call me, Valentine
Call me, Valentine

Follow Rivoli, follow Vivienne
Follow them to me, follow anything
Only wrong to do, saw them from afar
Crashing into view, follow anything
Follow your friends, but everyone's your friend
Only if the say, "Call up on me"
But you belong to me

We can get better, we can get better
We can get better, we can get better
We can get better, we can get better
We can do anything, yeah, we can do anything
You could be mine, yeah, we can try anything
We can say we'll try anything and you could be mineEmbed
