Monstrous Lyrics
Everything and nothing matters now
With you
Hold your hair back if you feel unwell
Do you?
Every night's the mark of a new day
And every day's the mark of something new
Promise that you'll follow me
This wasn't meant for me and you

So hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly, it's all I care about
Hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly, it's all I'm thinking of
Hold on tight to everything you care about
Hopelessly, it's all I dream about
Hold on tight 'cause this might be
The last time we dance

Didn't say you couldn't do it well
Only said, perhaps, to try again
I could never stop from listening in
And someone's left the car engine running
Every night's the mark of a new day
And every day's the mark of something new
Promise that you'll follow me
I couldn't stand to be alone
And it could wait
Wait for the after show
I've got four more, so why you bawling for?
I've got to hold back to burn
And I could have never swam better
But you could have turned a blind eye
But I've gone over the road
And I'm gonna go this time

So hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly, it's all I care about
Hold on tight to everything you love
Honestly, it's all I'm thinking of
Hold on tight to everything you care about
Hopelessly, it's all I dream about
Hold on tight 'cause this might be
The last time we dance here2Embed
