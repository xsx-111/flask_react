Never Wanted Lyrics
Never wanted, never needed
You said, "Honey, best be leaving"
If you want, I'll pack a bag
Foreign money in your hand
In your hand, baby

Tube of toothpaste, facial cleanser
Bar of soap and moisturiser

But it gets better
But it gets better
Ooh, oh-oh

Never wanted, never needed
You said, "Honey, how you feeling?"
Hotel pillow's worth a try
If you want me, swing on by
Swing on by, baby

Mini bar with many choices
Bedside table, distant voices, oh
But it gets better
But it gets better
Ooh, oh-oh

Does it get better?
Does it get better?
Does it get better?
Does it get better?

Never wanted, never needed
You said, "Honey, best be leaving"
If you want, I'll pack a bag
Foreign money in your hand
In your hand, baby4Embed
