King of Spain Lyrics
You know I am the King of Spain
And I know that you can never tear me apart again
The empty hall I roam around
And my friends don't understand I'll never lose again
You know I am the King of Spain
And I know that you can never bring me down again
Yeah I am the King of Spain
And I know that you can never tear me

No, I'm the king of Spain
I'm smiling to myself
I'm laughing out loud
I'll never cry again
No, I'm the king of Spain
I'm smiling to myself
They'll play my favorite song
I'll never cry again

You know I am the King of Spain
And I know that you will never bring me down again
Oh yeah, I am the King of Spain
And I know that you can never tear me
No, I'm the King of Spain
I'm smiling to myself
I'm laughing out aloud
I'll never cry again
Yeah, I'm the King of Spain
I'm smiling to myself
I'm laughing out aloud
'Cause I'm the King of SpainEmbed
