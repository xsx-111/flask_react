Pictures Lyrics
Baby, my head's full of wishes
Baby, my head's full of pictures
Baby, my head's full of colors
Baby, my head's full of pictures of you

Baby, I spend all my money
Baby, don't think that it's funny
Baby, my head's full of colors
Baby, my head's full of pictures of you

Baby, my head's full of wishes
Baby, my head's full of pictures
Baby, my head's full of colors
Baby, my head's full of pictures of you

Baby, I spend all my money
Baby, don't think that it's funny
Baby, my head's full of colors
Baby, my head's full of pictures of youEmbed
