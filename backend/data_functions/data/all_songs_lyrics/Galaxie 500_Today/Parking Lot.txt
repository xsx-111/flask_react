Parking Lot Lyrics
Sitting on a subway train and watching all the people lose their senses
Hiding in a parking lot and watching all the people fall to pieces

I don't mind
I think it's fine

Sitting on a subway train and watching all the people lose their senses
Hiding in a parking lot and watching all the people fall to pieces

I don't mind
I think it's fineEmbed
