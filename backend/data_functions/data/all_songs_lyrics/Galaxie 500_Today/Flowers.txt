Flowers Lyrics
I can never calm you down
And I can never turn you around
I could never bring you flowers
I could never turn you around

I can't be there when you're sleeping
I can't be inside your dreams
And I can't be there when you're sleeping
And I can't be inside your dreams
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Starin' at the kitchen sink
Feeling a plastic mood
Feel like things have gotta change
'Cause baby you're a lunatic

I can't be there when you're sleeping
And I can't be there in your dreams
And I can't be there when you're sleepin'
And I can't be inside your dreams
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Staring at the kitchen sink
Feeling a plastic mood
Feel like things have gotta change
'Cause baby you're a lunatic

And I can't be there when you're sleeping
I can't be there in your dreams
And I can't be there when you're sleeping
And I can't be the in your dreams
Oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
