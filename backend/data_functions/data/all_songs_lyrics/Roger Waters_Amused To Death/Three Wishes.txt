Three Wishes Lyrics
"I went to buy a....a gas bottle. At first, I wanted to buy a big one, but then I hadn't got enough money, so I had to buy a smaller one. And I think if I bought a bigger one, then it would have been... the way I wanted it. And then, we went home, and I put the children to bed. And I tidied the flat and everything. And then they were asleep and everything was a kind of night. I made a bed in the bathroom. I carried them there and put on the gas bottle. But today when I think back ... about that. If God did take me, I would've have been in hell because I wasn't right."

Reached back for the bottle
And rubbed against the lamp
Genie came out smiling
Like some Eastern tramp
He said, "Hey, boy, what's happening?
What is going on?
You can have three wishes
If you don't take too long
If you don't take too long"
I said, "Well I wish they all were happy in the Lebanon
Wish somebody'd help me write this song
I wish when I was young
My old man had not been gone"
Genie said, "Consider it done"

There's something in the air
And you don't know what it is
You see someone through a window
Who you've just learned to miss
And the road leads on to glory but
You've used up your last wish
Your last wish
And you want her to come home
Bring her home
Genie said, "I'm sorry
But that's the way it goes
Where the hell's the lamp sucker?
It's time for me to go
Bye!"


There's something in the air
And you don't know what it is
You see someone through a window
Who you've just learned to miss
And the road leads on to glory but
You've used up your last wish
Your last wish
And you want her to come home

"I go there sometimes twice a year now, sometimes only once. And sometimes when I feel like crying, I just go there."
