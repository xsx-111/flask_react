What God Wants, Part II Lyrics
"Do you believe in a better day?
Do you have faith in a golden way?
If you do, then we must come together this day
Come together as one, united television audience
Brought together by the sound of my voice
United, united financially, united socially
United spiritually, and all possible ways
Through the power of money
And the power of your prayers...."

What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants, God gets)

God wants dollars
God wants cents
God wants pounds, shillings, and pence
God wants guilders
God wants Kroner
God wants Swiss francs
And God wants French francs
(Oui il veut des francs francais)

God wants escudos
God wants pesetas
Don't send lira
God don't want small potatoes
God wants small towns
God wants pain
God wants clean up rock campaigns
God wants widows
God wants solutions
God wants TV
God wants contributions
What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants, God gets)
What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants, God gets)

God wants silver
God wants gold
God wants his secret never to be told
God wants gigolos
God wants giraffes
God wants politics
God wants a good laugh

What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants, God gets)

God wants friendship
God wants fame
God wants credit
God wants blame
God wants poverty
God wants wealth
God wants insurance
God wants to cover himself
What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants, God gets)
What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants, God gets)
What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants, God gets)
What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants, God gets)
What God wants, God gets, God help us all
(What God wants...)1Embed
