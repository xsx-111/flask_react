Too Much Rope Lyrics
*Sounds of chopping wood and horses pulling a sleigh*

When the sleigh is heavy
And the timber wolves are getting bold
You look at your companions and test
The water of their friendship, with your toe
And they significantly edge
Closer to the gold
Each man has his price, Bob
And yours was pretty low

Now history is short
And the sun is just a minor star
The poor man sells his kidneys
In some colonial bazaar
Que sera sera
Is that your new Ferrari car?
Nice!
But I think I'll wait for the F50

You don't have to be a Jew
To disapprove of murder
Tears burn my eyes
Muslim or Christian, Mullah or Pope
Preacher or poet who was it wrote
Give any one species too much rope
And they'll fuck it up
Last night on TV
A Vietnam vet takes his beard and his pain
And his alienation of twenty years
Back to Asia again
Sees the monsters they made
In Formaldehyde floating around
Meets a gook on a bike
A good little tyke, with the same soldier's eyes


What does it mean?
This tear jerking scene
Beamed into my home
That moves me so much
Why all the fuss?
It's only two humans being
It's only two humans being
Tears burn in my eyes
What does it mean?
This tender TV
This tear jerking scene
Beamed into my home
And you don't have to be a Jew
To disapprove of murder
Tears burn my eyes
Muslim or Christian, Mullah or Pope
Preacher or poet who was it wrote
Give any one species too much rope
And they'll fuck it up

 Oh my God!
 Dammit! Get help
 No! They're only children!
 Oh my God! Cathy, what have you done?
 The children! Have you both gone mad? He was sh.....
