Perfect Sense, Part I Lyrics
"Julia, however, in the light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we changed our minds. We have decided to include a backward message. Stanley, for you, and for all the other book burners... You're a dunderwit, Stanley! You're a sack'o'shite, Stanley!"
: Stop Dave
Will you stop Dave?
Stop Dave
I'm afraid
I'm afraid Dave
Dave, my mind is going
I can feel it
I can feel it
My mind is going
There is no question about it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
I'm afraid

The monkey sat on a pile of stone
And he stared at the broken bone in his hand
Strings of a Viennese quartet rang out across the land
The monkey looked up at the stars
And he thought to himself
Memory is a stranger
History is for fools
And he cleaned his hands in a pool of holy writing
Turned his back on the garden and set out for the nearest town
Hold on, hold on, soldier

When you add it all up
The tears and the marrow bone
There's an ounce of gold
And an ounce of pride in each ledger
And the Germans kill the Jews
And the Jews kill the Arabs
And the Arabs kill the hostages
And that is the news
And is it any wonder that the monkey's confused
He said, "Mamma, the President's a fool
Why do I have to keep reading these technical manuals?"
And the joint chiefs of staff
And the brokers on Wall Street said
"Don't make us laugh, you're a smart kid."
"Time is linear
Memory's a stranger
History is for fools
Man is a tool
In the hands of the great God Almighty."
And they gave him command of a nuclear submarine
Sent him back in search of the Garden of Eden2Embed
