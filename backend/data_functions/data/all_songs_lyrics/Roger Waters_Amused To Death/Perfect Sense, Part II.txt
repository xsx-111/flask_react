Perfect Sense, Part II Lyrics
Can't you see? It all makes perfect sense
Expressed in dollars and cents
Pounds, shillings and pence
Can't you see? It all makes perfect sense

Little black soul departs in perfect focus (Hold on, soldier)
Prime time fodder for the News at Nine (Hold on, hold on, soldier)
Darling, is the child warm in the bed tonight?

"Hi, everybody, I'm Marv Albert, and welcome to our telecast, coming to you live from Memorial Stadium! It's a beautiful day, and today we expect a sensational match-up! But first, our global anthem"

Can't you see? It all makes perfect sense
Expressed in dollars and cents
Pounds, shillings, and pence
Can't you see? It all makes perfect sense

"And here come the players! As I speak to you now, the captain has his crosshairs zeroed in on the oil rig! He's at periscope depth. It looks to me like he's going to attack! By the way, did you know that a submarine captain earns 200,000 dollars a year?"
"That's less tax, Marv"
"Yeah, less tax, thank you, Edward"
"You're welcome"
"Now back to the game- he fires one! Yes! There goes two! Both fish are running! The rig is going into a prevent defense! Will they make it? I don't think so! Look out! Look at that baby burn!"
*Explosion*
Can't you see? It all makes perfect sense
Expressed in dollars and cents
Pounds, shillings, and pence
Can't you see? It all makes perfect sense
Can't you see? It all makes perfect sense2Embed
