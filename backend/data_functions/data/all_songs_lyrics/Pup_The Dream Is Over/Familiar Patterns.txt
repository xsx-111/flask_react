Familiar Patterns Lyrics
This business ain't for the faint of heart
Well I fell for the bullshit
And then I started falling apart
And by the end of the summer
I let 'em get the best of me
What a goddamn bummer
What a waste of my energy

So I spent a long time down in the basement
Instead of rolling with the riff-raff
'Cause I know better
I know better than that
Yeah, I spent a lifetime trying to make it
And when I finally faced the facts
I never felt so shitty before
I never felt so miserable

Following familiar patterns
I'm falling back into ruin
I'm getting serious douche chills
Just being in this room
I didn't even see the humour
With the situation I was in
Knocking back Jell-O shooters
'Til I puked in the kitchen
Yeah, I spent a long time down in the basement
Instead of rolling with the riff-raff
'Cause I know better
I know better than that
I spent a lifetime trying to make it
And when I finally faced the facts
I never felt so shitty before
I never felt so miserable

They used to all talk down to me
And now they're biting their tongues
They used to say, "Don't quit your day job"
Well guess what? I never had one!
I never felt so shitty before
I never felt so miserable

I spent a long time down in the basement
Instead of rolling with the riff-raff
'Cause I am no better
I'm no better than that
Yeah, I spent a long time trying to make it
And when I finally faced the facts
I never felt so shitty before
I never felt so miserableEmbed
