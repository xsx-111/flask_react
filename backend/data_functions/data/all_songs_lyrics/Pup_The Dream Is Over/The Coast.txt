The Coast Lyrics
Canadian cold, Canadian cheer
I couldn't spend another winter up here
In this desolate fishing town
Counting the months as they wear me down

Watch over your flock
The cracks in the ice will swallow them up
The lake needs to eat just like all living things
And it's hungriest in the spring

Now you know what's eating me
Taking hold, it was dragging me down
It was dragging me down

The town is always on alert
In the spring, they patrol the coast, fearing the worst
And no one can seem to accept the fact
The lake gives us life and she takes it back

Now you know what's eating me
Taking hold, it was dragging me
Down in the valley where they found the body
It was growing cold

Now you know what's eating me
Taking hold, it was dragging me down
It was dragging me down

Now you know, now you know
Now you know what's eating me

In the dawn, another girl had gone missing
Last anyone heard, she'd gone out to go fishing
The cracks in the lake make a mighty fine grave
In the summer thaw1Embed
