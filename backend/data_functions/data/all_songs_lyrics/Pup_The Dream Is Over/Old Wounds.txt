Old Wounds Lyrics
I caught your eye on the back of the bus like you wanted
You wanna know why I don't come around anymore?
Well, it's so fucking obvious
I can't stand you hanging 'round lately
I can't stand you trying to save me
It's so fucking frustrating
I'm bored of the games and bored of the chase
That's the reason I left in the first place

You keep trying to rip open old wounds
It's so embarrassing, don't you know I'm over you?

Now, you wanna know where I've been lately?
You wanna know if I'm still a prick?
Well, I am and you're not gonna change me
So you got another guy going with you
You say you like him, but he's got a bad attitude
Well, maybe he's perfect for you
And maybe he deserves less trouble than you gave him
Or maybe he deserves his face in the pavement

You keep trying to rip open old wounds
It's so embarrassing, don't you know I'm over you?
And I'm trying to get it straight
Why the fuck I came back in the first place
You know I've never been good at anything
Except for fucking up and ruining everything
And I'm sick of it
It's so fucking frustrating
You're ripping open old wounds, it's embarrassing
Don't you know I'm over you?1Embed
