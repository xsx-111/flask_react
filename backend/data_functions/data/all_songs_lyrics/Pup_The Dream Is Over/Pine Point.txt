Pine Point Lyrics
Oh, in Pine Point, where I was born
The roads are all overgrown
And no one's lived there for years
The town was never the same
The mine was closed in '88
And everyone disappeared
In Pine Point, '86
My older brother died when we were kids
His best friend was wasted at the wheel
Oh, in Pine Point, nothing but memories
The abandoned cemetery
Where we buried our family

And I hope you know what you're doing

Up in Pine Point
Where I kept my eye on the prize
And it was you, it was you
Oh, in Pine Point
Where I kept my eye on the prize
And it was you, it was you

Oh, in Pine Point, it's deteriorating
And your memory started fading
So you called to let me know
You said it seems like forever
Since we've seen each other
Where does the time go?
And I said
I hope you know what you're doing

In Pine Point
In the house we grew up in
You said the room you were born in
It was just how you left it

Oh, in Pine Point
Where I kept my eye on the prize
And it was you, it was you
Oh, in Pine Point
Where I kept my eye on the prize
And it was you, it was you

I hope you know
I hope you know what you're doing, after all
I hope that you know
I hope you know
I hope you know
What you're doing, after all
I hope that you know
What you're doing3Embed
