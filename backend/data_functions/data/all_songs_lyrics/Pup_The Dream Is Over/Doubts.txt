Doubts Lyrics
I'll never get you outta my mind
It keeps me awake, and it keeps me alive
Now that you finally figured me out
I can go home and rest easier now

So what's left to lose?

Now that I've got nothing, you're having your doubts
You packed all of your bags and moved 'em all out
Now that I got nothing, you're having doubts
What am I supposed to do now?

I haven't felt quite like myself
For months on end
I spend more nights on the floor
Than in my own bed
And I never see my family
Or my friends anymore
And I'll write more apologies
Than metaphors

So what's left to lose?
What am I, what am I supposed to do now?
What's left to lose?
Now that I got nothing, you're having your doubts
You packed all of your bags and moved 'em all out
Now that I got nothing, you're having doubts
What am I supposed to do now?

What's left to lose?
What am I supposed to do without you?
What's left to lose?
What am I supposed to do without you?

Now that I got nothing, you're having your doubts
You packed all of your bags and moved 'em all out
Now that I got nothing, you're having doubts
What am I supposed to do now?

(Now that I got nothing)
What am I supposed to do
(Now that I got nothing)
Without you?
(Now that I got nothing)
What's left to lose?
What am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do now?Embed
