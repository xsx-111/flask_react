Sleep in the Heat Lyrics
I was feeling a little bizarre
The day that I buried my family car
In the scrap metal wrecking yard
And I've said so many goodbyes
In the twenty-five years that I've been alive
And I don't know why this one was so hard

And every time I go back to my apartment
All I wanna do is get stoned (Whoa oh-oh oh-oh)
And I'm sick and tired of blacking out on my carpet
And waking up all on my own, so I brought you home

You started falling apart
Six months after you moved in
And I should have known from the start
That things would be different
It's not something that I can fix
If I could do anything, you know I would
If this fucking vacation would come to an end
Maybe then you'd be normal again

Last week, when I went back to my apartment
You were looking so stoned (Whoa oh-oh oh-oh)
The day after Christmas, you acted so different
Just wanted to be on your own
So I bought you medicine, went to the vet and cashed
All of my savings and loans (Whoa oh-oh oh-oh)
But it was too late, you were letting go
Whoa, whoa oh-oh oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh
Whoa, whoa oh-oh oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh oh-oh, oh-oh

(Whoa, whoa oh-oh oh-oh) And nothing I say
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) Will make it okay
(Whoa oh-oh oh-oh, oh oh) You just sleep in the heat and repeat
(Whoa) You're wasting away
(Whoa oh-oh oh-oh) And nothing I do is gonna save you
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh) I'm trying my best, but you can't even
(Whoa oh-oh oh-oh, oh oh) Look at me or talk to me or tell me what's happening to you

Yesterday, I went back to my apartment
To see how you'd been holding up (Whoa oh-oh oh-oh)
You hadn't been eating, I thought you were sleeping, but
You're not waking up
And I want you to know that I'd spend every bit of my
Pitiful savings and loans (Whoa oh-oh oh-oh)
Just to see you again, but I know I won't5Embed
