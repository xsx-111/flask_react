DVP Lyrics
Your sister thinks that I'm a freak
She's been ignoring my calls, we haven't spoken in a week
I get so drunk that I can't speak
Yeah, nothing's working and our future's looking bleak, and I said

Woo, woo woo-ooh, woo woo-ooh
Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
Woo, woo woo-ooh, woo woo-ooh
She says that I drink too much
I'm fucked up and she hates my guts
She says I need to grow up

I'm driving fast to get away
Doing 180 on the Don Valley Parkway
Yeah, I'd be better off dead
I don't give a shit, I just don't wanna die, and I don't want to live, I said

Woo, woo woo-ooh, woo woo-ooh
Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
Woo, woo woo-ooh, woo woo-ooh
She says that I drink too much
I fucked up and she hates my guts
She says I need to grow up
I drink 'til I'm staring at the ceiling
I'll be just fine (I'm numb and losing feeling)
I can't tell lies anymore

Woo, woo woo-ooh, woo woo-ooh
Three beers and I'm so messed up
Get drunk and I can't shut up
Woo, woo woo-ooh, woo woo-ooh
She says that I drink too much
I fucked up and she hates my guts
Woo, woo woo-ooh, woo woo-ooh
I just don't know what to do
I'm still fucked up over you
Woo, woo woo-ooh, woo woo-ooh
She says that I drink too much
Hawaiian red fruit punch
She says I need to grow up!12Embed
