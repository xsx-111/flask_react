Julie & the Moth Man LyricsI’m feeling, feeling good
I’m waving to the prisoners the best I could
And there is one minute, minute a mile
I’m fucking in the alley ways, you know my style
So come on, West Riding, you do it well
Shed another tear for the boys in hell
And we dig El Topo, case of rum
Talking to your elders with a broken thumb
Julie, Julie
Wanna hit you with a frying pan
Julie, Julie
Wanna get you, wanna hurt you, wanna shoot you through a CAT scan
I am the mothman
I wanna eat right through your clothes
I wanna take you out for dinner
I’ll treat you good like an English rose
I’m feeling, feeling good
I’m waving to the prisoners the best I could
And there is one minute, minute a mile
I’m fucking in the alley ways, you know my style
So come on, West Riding, you do it well
Shed another tear for the boys in hell
And we dig El Topo, a case of rum
Talking to your elders with a broken thumb
Julie, Julie
I drip you off your ivory hand
Julie, Julie
Wanna get you, wanna hurt you, wanna dress you up like mothman
I am the mothman
I wanna eat right through your clothes
I wanna take you out for dinner
I’ll treat you good like an English rose
I am the mothman
I control the insectEmbed
