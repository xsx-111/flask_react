Neon Noon LyricsSink like a stone
Hear no sound
Time stood still
Enter the void
Leave no trace of where you've been
Never thought you'd understand
The years are slipping out of your hand
All we ever want to be
Was floating in the emerald sky
Our skeletons remain under a neon noon
Hands turn to dust
Psychic waves fill the air
All, all we have is what we've done to what we had
Never thought you'd understand
The years are slipping out of your hand
And all we ever wanted to be
Was floating in the emerald sky
Our skeletons remain under a neon noon
Sink like a stone
Hear no sound
Time stood still
All, all we have is what we've done to what we hadEmbed
