La Fee Verte Lyrics
Old green fairy, what you’ve done to me
I see Lucy in the sky telling me I’m high
I went out for some milk three days ago
I met Dali in the street, he knocked me off my feet

Oh, oh, oh (Ah)

Now I start to see that all’s not well
There’s policemen in my bed telling me I’m dead
If only I could show them what I’ve seen
I’ll have to take you down below where insects run the show

Sound and vision turning inside out
The lines make you look older then you’re gone

And everyday I got someone bringing me down
I got the eyes of a madman, I’m chasing round
How does it feel to live your life where nothing is real?
So just send me down the river

The neighbours say that I need locking up
Well they wouldn’t be the first to want me in a hearse
No one sleeps for I am still awake
Pass me over La Fée Verte, I’ll give you all a scare
Dogs in handbags, everyone’s a star
You look behind your eyelids then you’re gone

And everyday I got someone bringing me down
I got the eyes of a madman, I’m chasing round
How does it feel to live your life where nothing is real?
So just send me down the river

I’m not gonna wait for tomorrow
I just look back and wait for a sign
And I’m not gonna celebrate my freedom
So just send me down the river
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na-na

And everyday I got someone bringing me down
I got the eyes of a madman, I can't look round
How does it feel to live your life where nothing is real?
So just send me down the river8Embed
