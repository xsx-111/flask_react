Re-Wired Lyrics
I feel like the time has come
A fearless rescue from everyone
Who made you the master?
The lady caster?
I found you looking for a good time
I was out in exile
Perfecting my style
I knew you wanted a reaction

Hit me, harder
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that makes you feel electric
Even, faster
Than before
Gonna light em' up with you
Gonna light em' up with you
Try light em' up

Try to keep up, you scatter brain
She will enter, through your vein
Who was your creator?
The one who made you?
The flame I need to heat the silver
You bring Gods to their knees
Pick out the bad seeds
Relieve the Generals from their duty
Hit me, harder
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that makes you feel electric
Even, faster
Than before
Gonna light em' up with you
Gonna light em' up with you
Try light em' up


Who made you the master?
The lady caster?
I found you looking for a good time
Now this blood and glitter
It tastes so bitter
There's no retreat, for I surrender

Hit me, harder
I'm getting re-wired
I flip the switch that makes you feel electric
Even, faster
Than before
Gonna light em' up with you
Gonna light em' up with you
Flip the switch6Embed
