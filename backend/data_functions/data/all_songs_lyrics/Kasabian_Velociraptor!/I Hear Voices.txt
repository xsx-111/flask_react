I Hear Voices Lyrics
I hear voices
They tell me to stop
Why should I listen?
They've never felt the drop
They hide in corners
Behind the pretty girls
In their gold, in their gold, in their gold

One minute to a-
One minute to a-
One minute to midnight

My soul, you can have it 'cause it don't mean shit
I'd sell it to the devil for another hit
And midnight is coming and I wish that you were here

I hear voices
Echo in my brain
They don't like it
Cause I'm not dressed the same
They hunt for rabbits
Just like Yosemite Sam
Say your prayers, say your prayers, say your prayers
One minute to a-
One minute to a-
One minute to midnight

My soul, you can have it 'cause it don't mean shit
I'll sell it to the devil for another hit
And midnight is coming and I wish that you were here
My soul, you can have it 'cause it don't mean shit
I'll sell it to the devil for another hit
And midnight is coming and I wish that you were here

There's no need to fall
There's no need at all
Out of control on my own trying to find my way back
How did I end up here
And into darkness I walk as the world goes on by
Out of control on my own trying to find my way back
How did I end up here
And into darkness I walk as the world goes on by

I hear voices, they tell me to stop
I hear voices, they tell me to stop
I hear voices, they tell me to stop
I hear voices, they tell me to stopEmbed
