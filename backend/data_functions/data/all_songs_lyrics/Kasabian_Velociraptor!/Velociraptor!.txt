Velociraptor! Lyrics
Blast off!
He try to shoot you with precision
Take your face off
Young disciple, it's a lie
He was hung up
By the meaning of existence
You'll be let down
So don't you follow with your eye

Velociraptor!
He gonna find ya
He gonna kill ya
He gonna eat ya
You're on the outskirts
Of his kingdom
So keep your head down
Veloci, Velociraptor!

Shake down
Go get your suitcase
Call a director
Film everyone in sight
'Cos there's an air raid
You want to get laid?
But he is closing
And he ain't toothless man
Velociraptor!
He gonna find ya
He gonna kill ya
He gonna eat ya
You're on the outskirts
Of his kingdom
So keep your head down
Veloci, Velociraptor!
 (x2)
Oh, oh, oh
There's nothing to it!
There's nothing to it, man!

And now you're lying there
Just staring at the moon
He just want to suck your blood

Blast off!
Unavoidable collision
Getting scared now
'Cos there's nowhere left to hide
Are you ready?
Hear the scratching getting closer
There's no food left
And you're the only one alive
The voodoo
The vaccine
The boredom
The routine
Dictating your movements
It's all got too much
For the addicts
The manics
The papers
The vapour
The pressure of so-called
Normal behaviour
 (x2)
Oh, oh, oh
There's nothing to it!
There's nothing to it, man!

Meanwhile, in city streets
As everyone's asleep
He just want to suck your blood

Velociraptor!
He gonna find ya
He gonna kill ya
He gonna eat ya
You're on the outskirts
Of his kingdom
So keep your head down
Veloci, Velociraptor!1Embed
