Days Are Forgotten Lyrics
Hey son I'm looking forwards
You're aiming backwards, of this I'm sure
Have you had enough?
Are you feeling rough?
Does your skull hurt?
Well if it's war...

Cause I am taking back what's mine
I am taking back the time
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Right here now, I'm waiting
For someone or something
To take me, to take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
You've simply forgotten
How to disappear

Hombre, I got blood lust
Feeding you bread crust
I leave no scar
You say I'm old hat, a fucking dirty rat
Call me a cliche, how right you are
Cause I am with the vagabonds
I am writing all your wrongs
You may call it suicide
But I'm being born again
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
Right here now, I'm waiting
For someone or something
To take me, to take me over

Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
You've simply forgotten
How to disappear
Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
You've simply forgotten
How to disappear

I saw something out there on the darkest star
You were sat home chewing on monkey brain

I am not here, I'm just a silhouette
You will never ever ever forget
Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
You've simply forgotten
How to disappear
Days, days are forgotten
Now it's all over
Simply forgotten
How to disappear

I saw something out there on the darkest star
You were sat home chewing on monkey brainEmbed
