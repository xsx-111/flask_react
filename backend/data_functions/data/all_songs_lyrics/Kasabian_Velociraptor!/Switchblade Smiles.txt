Switchblade Smiles Lyrics
Switchblade smiles
They go on for miles
And will be forever
Now we stand together
There's no denials
Much too soon
For the wooden spoon
Can you hear the knocking
Now your feet are stomping around the room
(Oh! Oh!)
Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?

Move back this wrecking ball
Rips through the blackest hole
Violence is coming, is coming, is coming
Move back this wrecking ball
Rips through the blackest hole
Violence is coming, I'm running, I'm running
Switchblade smiles
They go on for miles
And will be forever
Now we stand together
There's no denials
Much too soon
For the wooden spoon
Can you hear the knocking
Now your feet are stomping around the room

Ring a ring o' roses
A pocket full of posers
Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?)
Uniform disguises
(Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?
Move
Can you feel it coming?)
Who will leave alive
I know you wanna do it cause you said it's a lie
You're marching for your people on a warning sky
And all you wanna say "Boy, I've got no soul"
And time it for the people is full of control

Move back this wrecking ball
Rips through the blackest hole
Violence is coming, is coming, is coming
Move back this wrecking ball
Rips through the blackest hole
Violence is coming, I'm running, I'm running1Embed
