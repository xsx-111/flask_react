Goodbye Kiss Lyrics
Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss
I'd broke my wrist
It all kicked off
I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind
'Cos love's hard to find

La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence far too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
'Cos we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true

La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand
Let go of my hand

Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again
You go your way and
I'll go my way
No words can save us
This lifestyle made us
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we can meet againEmbed
