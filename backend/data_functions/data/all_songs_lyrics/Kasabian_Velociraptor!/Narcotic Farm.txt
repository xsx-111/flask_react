Narcotic Farm LyricsCome down lady, flying eight miles high
You got the soul and you don't even, don't even try
Jet black tulip like a smoking gun
You got no rhythm but you know how to, know how to run
At the narcotic farm they will do you no harm
Hey, follow me down
To where the executioner will bring me back 'round
Hey won't you follow me down
To where the executioner will bring me back 'round
Bitch slap beauty with a pygmy smile
Ain't got control but I know that you can dig my style
Blown out fuses with a new town scum
You got the rhythm but you know how to, know how to run
At the narcotic farm they will do you no harm
At the narcotic farm they will do you no harm
Hey, follow me down
To where the executioner will bring me back 'round
Hey, won't you follow me down
To where the executioner will bring me back 'roundEmbed
