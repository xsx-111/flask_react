Black Whistler LyricsTwo shots in the morning
Take it easy on yourself
A banging head from yesterday
Pigeons fly so freely
Now the landlord kicks the door
Fetch a chair and stop that whore
'Cause we're so happy
I said we're happy at being sad
So wake up, oh wake up
'Cause I don't wanna fight with you no more
Wake up, fool wake up
Well we'll forget about the jungle on the floor
We can forget about the jungle on the floor
Warmth is for my lover
And the other for my hate
I guess that really sums us up
'Cause we're so happy
I said we're happy at being sad
So wake up, oh wake up
'Cause I don't wanna fight with you no more
I said now wake up, oh wake up
Well we'll forget about the jungle on the floor
We can forget about the jungle on the floorEmbed
