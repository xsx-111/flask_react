Pistols at Dawn LyricsI'm the smoke behind the screen
Astronaut in the limosine
Barbiturates, amphetamines
Put accidentally in your magazines
The mutiny amongst the thieves
All the cards hiding up my sleeves
Bandages, a stripper's thighs
Tell the jury you're an animal
Yeah, oh yeah!

Best-laid plans can wait, don't need them now
This aggravation is heavy duty
Best-laid plans can wait, don't need them now
You've got to slow down and see the beauty
Straighten up, take your pills
Nuts is watching, so forget your thrills
Plastic limbs, antidotes
Now you see it was all a hoax
Microchips inside your ears
Tapping into your inner fears
Lousy kids, weak and sick
Beaten up with the ugly stick
Yeah, oh yeah

Best made plans can wait, don't need them now
This aggravation is heavy duty
Best made plans can wait, don't need them now
You've got to slow down and see the beauty
Oh, temper, temper, missy
Resorting to violence if you disagree
Oh, the rhythm, the rhythm is slow
Have to admit you're the star of the show
Oh, temper, temper, missy
Sitting there laughing, it's now that you see
Oh, the visions, the visions are black
Tears on your gravestone, you're not coming back
I'm the smoke, a mockingbird
The filthy joke that you overheard
So here's the squeeze, I am you
You're always fucked but you never knew
Yeah, oh yeah

Best made plans can wait, don't need them now
This aggravation is heavy duty
Best made plans can wait, don't need them now
You've got to slow down and see the beautyEmbed
