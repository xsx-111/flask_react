Go! Lyrics
You, you, you, meet me, me, me
At the station, station
Can't-can't get-get u-u-used
To patience, patience
Wish time, this time
Could just be a bit shortened, shortened
Be-be-be-tween u-u-us
Six million seasons

Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run
And make it or die

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Our love, our love (Our love, our love)
Ran away, ran away (Ran away, ran away)
Gotta save it, gotta save it (Gotta save it, gotta save it)
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you
Our love, our love (Our love, our love)
Ran away, ran away (Ran away, ran away)
Gotta save it, gotta save it (Gotta save it, gotta save it)
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' for you
Fe-Fe-Feels like we-we-we'll be frozen, frozen
Ne-Ne-Need you to-to tell me, "Je t'aime, Je t'aime"
Full speed cause we got a lot to discover, cover
Ge-Ge-Get me ju-ju-just a little closer

Gotta run, gotta run, gotta run
And make it or die

8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2

Our love, our love (Our love, our love)
Ran away, ran away (Ran away, ran away)
Gotta save it, gotta save it (Gotta save it, gotta save it)
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you
Our love, our love (Our love, our love)
Ran away, ran away (Ran away, ran away)
Gotta save it, gotta save it (Gotta save it, gotta save it)
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' for you

Iâ€™m gonna come, just meet me there (Our love, our love)
Gonna come straight away (Ran away, ran away)
I'm gonna come just meet me there (Gotta save it, gotta save it)
Gonna start us through the wave
Gonna find you in the night
Gonna make it or die (Our love, our love) (8, 7)
Gonna come straight away (Ran away, ran away) (6, 5)
I'm gonna
Gonna start us through the wave (Gotta save it, gotta save it)(4, 3)
Gonna find you in the night
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' for you

Our love, our love
Ran away, ran away
Gotta save it, gotta save it
I'm comin', I'm comin', I'm comin' for you
Our love, our love (Our love, our love)
Ran away, ran away (Ran away, ran away)
Gotta save it, gotta save it (Gotta save it, gotta save it)
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done without you3Embed
