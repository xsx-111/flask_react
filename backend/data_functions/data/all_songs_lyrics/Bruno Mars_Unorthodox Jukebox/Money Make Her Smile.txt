Money Make Her Smile Lyrics
All you, get back, coming to the stage
Is a girl who's new in town
She go by the name 'Where Your Stacks At?'
This pretty little thing, I swear, won't let you down
Watch her drop it like, (Da-dat, da-dat, da-dat, da-dat) hey!

Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile

She's a super freak
You wouldn't know it if you saw her outside these velvet walls
No, she don't go where preachers preach
She only go to the church where dollars fall
Watch her drop it like, (Da-dat, da-dat, da-dat, da-dat) hey!
Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile

(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Watch her
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Got, got, got, got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Got, got, got, got)

Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
(Give her what you got, give her, give her what you got)
Money, money, money make her smile9Embed
