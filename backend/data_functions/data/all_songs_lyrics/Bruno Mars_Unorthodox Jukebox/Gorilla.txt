Gorilla Lyrics
Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle, you can't run
'Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You just smiling, tell me "Daddy, it's yours"
'Cause you know how I like it, you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT, we don't stop
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby
Give it to me, motherfucker!"
Oh, look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
'Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same, baby, once I'm done with
Yoo-oo-oo-oo-oou, yeah

You, you, you...

Oh, you with me, baby, making love like gorillas
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, you and me, baby, we'll be fucking like gorillas
(Oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, baby, aw, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe
I just want one smile, want one smile, want one smile, babe
Once I lay besides you, girl, I will make you scream, "yeah, yeah"
Girl, let me take my time, take my time, take my time, babe
I just want one smile, want one smile, want one smile, babe
Once I get inside you, girl, I will make you scream, "yeah, yeah, yeah"
Come on (etc.)
Yeah, yeah, yeah44Embed
