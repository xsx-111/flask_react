Show Me Lyrics
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Baby, here we are again, ooh

I can see it in your eyes, you want a good time
You wanna put your body on mine
Alright, but don't change your mind
Don't you change it, oh, no
Oh, yeah, you called me today
Drove all this way, so don't let this buzz go to waste, oh, no
Your pleasure, pleasure island is where we can go

No, I won't think you're easy, no, I won't think you're fast
Your eyes say amazing, but your lips came to ask
No need to fight it, when you know it feels right
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes

Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Love the way that you laugh, the way that you smile
Makes me feel like you've been waiting a while
But, guess what, darling? I've been waiting, too
So let's grind, we can get freaky tonight
Right is your ticket to ride
Tell me, girl, what you gon' do?

No, I won't think you're easy, no, I won't think you're fast
Your eyes say amazing, but your lips came to ask
No need to fight it, when you know it feels right
You say you're a woman who knows what she likes

Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, uh

It's gettin' freaky in this room, room, room
Now let me hear you say you want that boom, boom, boom
We can take it slow, we can zoom, zoom, zoom
Baby, if you're ready for that uh-uh-uh
It's gettin' freaky in this room, room, room
Now let me hear you say you want that boom, boom, boom
We can take it slow, we can zoom, zoom, zoom
Baby, if you're ready for that uh-uh-uh
Then show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah
Girl, show me, you got to, you got to show me
You tell me all day that you're lonely
But show me, show me, show me tonight, yeah5Embed
