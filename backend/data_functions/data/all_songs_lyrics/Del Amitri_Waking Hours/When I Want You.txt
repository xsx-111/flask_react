When I Want You Lyrics
You sent greetings from Liverpool
And I took the next train
Passed by people putting flowers on graves and
We got delayed
When I arrived you had vanished like steam
And left me in a diesel day
So I walked around and spent ten pounds
In amusement arcades

Felt like I was in a field
Looking for a pin
It's a kind of loneliness
It's a kind of emptiness
But I'm not trying I'm just rehearsing
For the perfect day

When I want you, I'll come looking for you
When I want you, I'll come looking for you
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will
Yes I will, yes I will

I took a spoon to the swimming pool
To drain your trace away
And I changed my name so only my looks remain
And if looks could kill I'd need a license for my face
'Cos where his fists put bruises
A scheming smile now takes their place
Felt like I was in a field
Looking for a pin
It's a kind of loneliness
It's a kind of emptiness
But I'm not trying I'm just rehearsing
For the perfect day

When I want you, I'll come looking for you
When I want you, I'll come looking for you
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will
Yes I will, yes I will
Yes I will
When I want you, I'll come looking for you
When I want you, I'll come looking
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will
Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will
Yes I willEmbed
