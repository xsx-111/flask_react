This Side Of The Morning LyricsNobody's perfect
And that's something that I'm sure she'll know
'Cos trying to tell her lies from the truth at times
Is like trying to divide ice from snow
And when I knew it was over
I jumped into a taxi and said, "Just guess where to go"
And the driver turned about and said
"Finding what you want is like
Trying to divide ice from snow"
So here I sit, rolling back to bed
Knowing love's a hazard that I'd never guessed
But from this side of the morning I couldn't care less
I couldn't care less
Nobody's helpless
Although I've never felt this helpless before
And trying to persuade myself not to think about her
Is like trying to tell the clouds not to pour
So I'll put down the bottle
While in my head time is collapsing and the currents run cold
So I'll curse her memory
But don't try telling me that she was not the emerald in a mountain of coal
Or there's a crock of cures for cancer at the end of the rainbow
So here I sit, rolling back to bed
Knowing love's a hazard that I'd never guessed
But from this side of the morning I couldn't care less
I couldn't care less
She's the kind of girl who won't forgive but will forget
So take me from this party, driver, put me back to bed
I wanted to be loved but just got laughed at instead
So if this taxi's for hire
I'll get in the back just to feel the friction of the tarmac and the tyres
So nobody's perfect
And that's something that I'm sure she'll know
But trying to persuade myself not to think about her is like
Trying to tell the cockerels not to crow
Or like trying to tell the striker not to think about the goal
So here I sit, rolling back to bed
Knowing love's a hazard that I'd never guessed
But from this side of the morning
Yeah, from this side of the morning
Yeah, from this side of the morning
I couldn't care lessEmbed
