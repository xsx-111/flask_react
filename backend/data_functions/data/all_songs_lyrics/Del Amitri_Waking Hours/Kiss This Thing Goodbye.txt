Kiss This Thing Goodbye LyricsIt seems like weeks since you looked at me, baby, without that look of distaste
I don't know why your feelings are changing but I've seen it in your face
And all those times when our lips were kissing, our tongues were telling lies
And all those signs I've been missing right there in your eyes
So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye
I sometimes feel when we're together baby, everything has turned out wrong
And I know you feel exactly the same way but still we carry on
I've been waiting up by the window watching these cars go by
And I tell myself that I'll go through the motions for the last time tonight
So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye
Now I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise, I'm watching the light fade away
And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door, and you'll stand here and say
Come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye
Better make it sooner than later
Before it all turns sour
Don't you know we'd better kiss this thing goodbyeEmbed
