Move Away Jimmy Blue LyricsA struck match faded like a nervous laugh
Beyond the halo of a naked bulb
And your low voice mingles with your other half's
Schoolfriends in second-hand clothes
Eventually your world will shrink within four walls
Of neglected debts and stolen stereos
So move away Jimmy Blue
Before your small, small town turns around and swallows you
A drunk mother was the cue
For the legendary things that you do
Behind the carnival tent with mud on your face
Behind the old glue factory too
So move away Jimmy Blue
Before your small, small town turns around and swallows you
Wet feet visit the same old places
You're finding nothing new
It's a bin full of tissues from made-up faces
In a town full of nothing to do
A love match with the moon
In a layby, while insects hum and
You got put in the darkness of a woman's womb
Jimmy Blue, Jimmy Blue
So move away
Turn around and move away
Yeah, move away Jimmy Blue
Before your small, small town turns around and swallows youEmbed
