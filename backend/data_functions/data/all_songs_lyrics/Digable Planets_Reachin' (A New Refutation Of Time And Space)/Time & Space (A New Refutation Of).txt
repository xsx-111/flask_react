Time & Space (A New Refutation Of) Lyrics
Slip slide, dip then take a dive
Planets lookin' high when we travellin' on a vibe
Cribs, dorms grasshoppers in swarms
Thinkin' life is big, is that hip is it norm
Psych-e-delic and fat
Flowers and beads and peaces and naps
Ah yes, planets got the blessed
Beats are played on Friday to get Monday off your chest
Kick live dig into the quotes
Lose yourself and groove in the beauty as it floats
Hair, clothes monochrome it ain't
Many different worlds in the sweet and funky joint
Pounds, hands speakers and jams
Even those that flams get fitted in the plans
Light, years sugar for your ears
Hip-hop is the fave we been diggin' it for years

Funk, rhythm psychedelic money
Studied my lessons got vision 20/20
Check out the glow they need it what we brought
Ladybug, don't we boom it from New York?

Yes we do, uh
Time, space, what is that like
Just how we livin' when in the hip life
Kids, roll with hot buttered soul
From 125 right down to Ludlow
The juice the cup the token fare is up
The ancestors peace with the daughters of the dust
We just freaks, aquafunky beats
Vented to the streets from the boxes and the jeeps
Nuclear is we different time different space
Up on planet Earth we brought the mad bass
Brung is the tongue they all can understand
I'm free so let me pass it to my G

Check me out, Butterflies funk induced highs
I gain a better reason to smack me up a five
Bald caps, pleasurable naps
Time and space is fake and that's the real haps
Youth flights, land on Friday nights
Birds be with the cats DJ's savin' lives
Soul funk jive and rhythm
Jams be ‘til and 'til, but been funkin’ since 11
Sound drips comin' off the lips
Smuggled from the planets that freak the 9 zips
Time space no one's is alike
Be you and just be you or be out

That's right so
Step into the jams
Let the sugars make you sweet
Kept it underhand cause the planets get you free
Ladybug Mecca with the groove in time and space
With the funk and rhythm butter chase2Embed
