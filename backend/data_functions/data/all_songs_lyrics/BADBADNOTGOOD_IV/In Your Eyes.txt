In Your Eyes Lyrics
Don't blow me off so I can't help it
When you shy off I can't help it
And I know you know it's wrong but I'm ready
So just rid yourself of him and come get it

Got you enticed from the middle
You know I'm willing and able
And I know you know it's on when you're ready
So just rid yourself of him and come get it

Oooh, I see it in your eyes
In your eyes every time
(In your eyes)
Oooh, I see it in your eyes every time

I know there's something about me
That you can't wait to just tell me
And I love the way you move, it's so bashful
So just take my hand 'cause baby it's natural

And I got you enticed from the middle
And I know you're willin' and able
And I know you've got someone but I'm ready
So just rid yourself of him and come get it
Oooh, I see it in your eyes
In your eyes every time
(In your eyes)
Oooh, I see it in your eyes
In your eyes every time
Oh

I'll let you into my life
And I'll show you, oh, when it's right
Then I guess we can say we tried
Don't let this fall by the side

Cause I can't, can't leave
And I can't, can't wait
Cause I can't, can't leave
And I can't, can't wait
Cause I see it in your eyes
And I feel it every time
Cause I see it in your eyes7Embed
