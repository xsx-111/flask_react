Soon LyricsGirls don't wait alone
I've seen it in your eyes
Lord knows, which way's the way?
I've read a sign
And soon you'll return to the place you've learned: Ohio!
And soon there are people who live and who care there that I know
They'll greet you, receipt you, retreat you, then leave you alone
They'll entreat you, receive you, and treat you like someone they know
Soon you'll be waking with season that changes you know
Soon you'll be making your way to way back homeEmbed
