From One Cums One LyricsI am certain of definite errors in my thinking
Example: knowing I can't know
From one cums one
One removed twice
From one cums
From one cums one
Try and prove this song
By loading it into a Central American gun or
Quit my army
I think love
Now think the stars without any reason
Held up by nothing
None of your business
Imagine this: the stars are being swallowed up by your eyes
From one cums one
One removed twice
From one cums
From one cums oneEmbed
