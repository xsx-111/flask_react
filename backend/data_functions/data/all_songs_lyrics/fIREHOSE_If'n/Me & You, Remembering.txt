Me & You, Remembering LyricsRemember?
Me at first - couldn't remember
Me and you talking - remember?
'Bout Dick Hell, remember?
Remember me and you talking 'bout the time I couldn't remember remembering? remember?
Remember talking 'bout remembering 'bout Dick Hell, remember?
You remember, I want to ... I do! remember?
But now it's just you and me singing songs, singing 'bout... Madonna!?Embed
