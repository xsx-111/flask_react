Anger LyricsSwelling up 'til it don't matter much
Overwhelming, choking without a way to get it out
It screams inside and I wait for control, for containment
Then another wave
I lash out at any who choose, choose to be there
Rejecting responsibility, I hold it all, feel it all: overwhelming
Overwhelming
Overwhelming
Choking without a hope but knowing perspectives are twisted
Theirs and mine
Seeing what we choose
Not feel, not love, not reality
But a cold sense of endlessness
As it gets colder
I grow older, not wiser
Anger
Anger
