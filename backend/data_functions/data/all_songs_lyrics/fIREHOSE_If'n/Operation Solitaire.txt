Operation Solitaire LyricsVera takes a glass off the shelf
Dreaming the dust is secret
A smile on her face in the mirror
An old friend she knew lives within her
Tonight, men's machines wake ma
Showers of morning rinse away nightmares
While Sant√© rests, hung easy in blue twilight
Remember him pinched in Pocatello?
Here white's a sign of lifeless living
Outside, due to weather, it darkens
Some lives cause some to stare
Others try to win operation solitaireEmbed
