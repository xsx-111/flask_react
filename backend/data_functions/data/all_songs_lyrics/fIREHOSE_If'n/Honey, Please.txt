Honey, Please LyricsFix a place inside a station
With a pace in time with spacing
Mix the makings, foot the faking
Shit forsaken!
Laying in the sun baking!
Hey honey please! Hey honey please!
Hey honey please! Hey honey!
Meter reading, facts a-feeding
Got a place in book o'mason
'Pert-near hardcore almost nearly more
I'm embarrassed for showing you the other door
Hey honey please! Hey honey please!
Hey honey please! Hey honey!
Keep an eye on there in Washington
Watch the watchingmen, watching Washington
Feel for you, feel for me,feel for the light that liberates the day!
Hey honey please! Hey honey please!
Hey honey please! Hey honey!
Hey honey please! Honey please!
Hey honey please!
Hey honey please! Hey honey please!
Hey honey please! Hey honey!Embed
