Windmilling LyricsTwo of us windmilling
Swirling in another time
Let my feet touch the ground
The doors revolve and choirs sing
Windmilling
Wheels in motion
What life you draw through me!
The doors revolve and choirs sing
Windmilling
Two of us windmilling
Wrap me in barbed wire
Bring out the sting in me
The doors revolve and choirs sing
WindmillingEmbed
