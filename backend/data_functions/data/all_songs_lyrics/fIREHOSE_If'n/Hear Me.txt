Hear Me LyricsTime stuffs the culture into human socks
While feats of fancy, flaming fire, from a tangent rock
Benefitting well intentions, fitted with guitar
Armed with you know (current heroes) being what they are
Hear me, ya hear? Hear me
Facing with the racing and the mason and the dude
Sideways seeing John Mills on the sidelines talking rude
The temporal and the corporal set sights above the moon
Tweaking down the police sound by singing them a tune
Hear me, ya hear? Hear me
It is said degrees divide a circle square
Pencil out each portion let a ruler keep it fair
Dedicate all history to this abstract here
Then throw away the paper trade the circle for a sphere
Hear me, ya hear? Hear me
Hear me, ya hear? Hear meEmbed
