Making The Freeway LyricsPounds, lets say pounds is the weight of the town
Coming down all around
Grounding me into round like the noun thats found
When you're looking straight down a handgun barrel
Firing off a round, yo!
Making the freeway safe for the free way
And I'm drowning in the frowns of a million clowns
And I'm drowning in the frowns of a million clowns
And I'm drowning in the frowns of a million clowns
And I'm drowning in the frowns of a million clowns
Making the freeway safe for the freeway
Pounds, lets say pounds is the weight of the town
Coming down all around
Grounding me into round like the noun thats found
When you're looking straight down a handgun barrel
Firing off a round, yo!
Making the freeway safe for the freeway
And I'm drowning in the frowns of a million clowns
And I'm drowning in the frowns of a million clowns
And I'm drowning in the frowns of a million clowns
Making the freeway safe for the freewayEmbed
