It Never Rains Lyrics
I hear the Seven Deadly Sins
And the Terrible Twins came to call on you
The bigger they are, baby
The harder they fall on you
And you, you're always the same you persevere
On the same old pleasure ground

Oh, and it never rains around here
It just comes pouring down

You had no more volunteers
So you got profiteers, for to help you out
Well, with friends like that, babe
Good friends you had to do without
And now they've taken the chains and the gears
From off the merry-go-round

Oh, and it never rains around here
It just comes pouring down

Now, your new Romeo
Was just a gigolo when he let you down
See, the faster they are, babe
The faster they get out of town
They're leaving make up stains
And the tears of a clown
Oh, and it never rains around here
It just comes pouring down

Oh, you were just a roller coaster memory
I don't know why I was even passing through
Saw you making a date with Destiny
When he came around here asking after you
In the shadow of the Wheel of Fortune
You're busy trying to clear your name
You say "I may be guilty, yeah, that may be true
But I'd be lying if I said I was to blame
See, we could have been major contenders
We never got no money, no breaks
You've got a list of all the major offenders
You got a list of all their major mistakes"

And he just standing in the shadows
Yes and he smile that come-on smile
Oh I can still hear you say as clear as the day
"I'd like to make it worth your while"
Oh, but it's a sad reminder
When your organ grinder has to come to you for the rent
And all you've got to give him
Is the use of your side-show tent
Yes, and that's all that remains of the years
Spent doing the rounds
And it never rains around here
Well, it just comes pouring down

Now you know what they say about beggars, babe
You can't complain about the rules
And you know what they say about beggars
You know who's the first to blame his tools
You never gave a damn about-a who you pick up
And leave-a layin' bleedin' on the ground
You screw people over on your way up
Because you thought that you were never coming down
And he'll take you out in Vaudeville Valley
With his hand up smothering your screams
And he'll screw you down in Tin Pan Alley
In the city of a billion dreams, get out!
