Weenie Beenie Lyrics
I'm molasses
Hung in rent
Read a sponsor
One shot, no post-show

Tear it off, but not a lot
It's not enough to debate

As if you blame
Real and stagnate
Real and stagnate
Big shit, no shit

Tear it off, but not a lot
Only so much you can take

Some try that hit
Beast and mud lead
Beast and mud lead
Big shit, no shit
Tear it off, but not a lot
Only so much you can take

As if you blame
Real and stagnate
Real and stagnate
Big shit, no, duh

Tear it off, but not a lot
It's not enough to debate
Right?

I'm molasses
Hung in rent
Read a sponsor
One shot, no post-show

Tear it off, but not a lot
Only so much you can take
One shot, nothing
One shot, nothing
One shot, nothing
One shot, nothing
One shot, nothing
One shot, nothing
One shot, nothingEmbed
