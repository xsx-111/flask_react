Floaty Lyrics
He floats
Floats away
On the ground
He comes back down

They float
Float away
On the ground
They come back down

She floats
Floats away
On the ground
She comes back down

We float
Float away
On the ground
We come back down

That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round
He floats
Floats away
On the ground
He comes back down

She floats
Floats away
On the ground
She comes back down

That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here

They float
Float away
On the ground
They come back down

We float
Float away
On the ground
We come back down
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here
That's not as big as what's flown 'round here4Embed
