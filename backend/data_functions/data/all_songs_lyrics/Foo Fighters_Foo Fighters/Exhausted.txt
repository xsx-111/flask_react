Exhausted Lyrics
I'm not around that much, running
Exhausted
And lost
If it could be undone, will it
Have costed?
It's taught
And lost

Blowing away, we stray wilted
Exalted
At fault
What if the day had stayed in bed?
These baubles
We've brought
At fault


After the bliss has long ended
This caution
This fault
Give me a breeze that's long-winded
Accosted
Adult
