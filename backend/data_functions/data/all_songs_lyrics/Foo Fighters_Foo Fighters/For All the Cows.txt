For All the Cows Lyrics
I'm called a cow
I'm not about
To blow it now
For all the cows
For all the cows
It's funny how
Money allows
All to browse
And be endowed
This wish is true
It falls into
Pieces new
The cow is you
The cow is you

My kind has all run out
As if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everything worn in
Everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend

I said you're all
A painted doll
And it caused
The walls to fall
How far is he?
Impatiently
That's as far as far can be
As far could be
My kind has all run out
As if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everything worn in
Everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend

I'm called a cow
I'm not about
To blow it now
For all the cows
It's funny how
Money allows
All to browse
And be endowed
And be endowed

My kind has all run out
As if kinds could blend
Some time if time allows
Everything worn in
Everything worn in
Everything worn in like it's a friend1Embed
