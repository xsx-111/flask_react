X-Static Lyrics
Leading everything along
Never far from being wrong
Never mind these things at all
It's nothing
Couldn't find a way to you
Seems that's all I ever do
Turning up in black and blue
Rewarded

All the static we all left


Wait until the time has come
Figure that's where time comes from
Leaving all my senses numb is heaven
Lifted up the fay to seen
Anything could never be
Anything but play to me
In order
All the static we all left


Take it back for them to keep
Fallen into something deep
Not that I had made that leap
Anointed

All the static we all left

Where have all the wishes gone?
Now that all of that is done
Wish I would've felt I'd won for once1Embed
