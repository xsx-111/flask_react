Wattershed Lyrics
Stick it to the mailman
Pinned against a pot plant
Sick of all the suntan
Oily with the Ray-Ban

Take that to the bank and call it a check
Masked without a weapon

Skinny as a spit pan
Dealing with the shit plan
Playing with my bad hand
Just another rock band

Take that to the man and call it a check
Trapped within a contract

Hey there boy, while you were catching the black widow
The rest of us were watching Melrose

I wanna swim in the wattershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead
I'm so pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
Miss it and I can't wait

Take that to the man and call it a check
Trapped within a contract

Hey man, can't you tell it's still a problem?
See you at the devil's tower

I wanna swim in the wattershed
I wanna listen to the flowerhead
I lost a gallon and still I bled
I keep on thinking I get ahead

I'm so pissed at all the disc jam
Pissed about the 5-ham
Pissed about the green state
I miss it and I can't wait1Embed
