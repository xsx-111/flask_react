Starlight Lyrics
Starlight callin'
Callin', callin'

Starlight, I hear you
Callin' out to me
(I hear you callin', callin', callin', callin')
Sweet love, rollin'
Across my mind again
(You roll across my mind)
I want you, yes, I do
I need you, yes, I do

And then you run
You gotta stop

Foolin' around
Keep your feet
On the ground, little girl
And starlight will shine
All around, little girl
(Starlight callin')
Starlight
Your eyes are lookin' out so far away
(I hear you callin', callin', callin', callin')
Constellation in the sky
Is smiling down on me
I wonder, wonder why
(I wonder, wonder why)
I can feel you're so real
I can see you're so near

And then you run
You gotta stop

Foolin' around
Keep your feet
On the ground, little girl
And starlight will shine
All around, little girl
You had me all
Summer long, little girl
(It's no good at all)
Moon glow
Come light the way up to my window
(I hear you callin', callin', callin', callin')
As you roll across the night
Don't tell nobody
That I told you so
I need you, yes, I do
I need you, yes, I do
And then you run
You gotta stop

Foolin' around
Keep your feet
On the ground, little girl
And starlight will shine
All around, little girl
You had me all
Summer long, little girl
(It's no good at all)

Starlight, your eyes
Are lookin' down on me
So far away
Starlight, your eyes
Are lookin' down on me
So far away
Starlight, your eyes
Are lookin' down on me
So far away
Starlight, your eyes
Are lookin' down on me
So far away
Starlight, your eyes
Are lookin' down on me
So far away...2Embed
