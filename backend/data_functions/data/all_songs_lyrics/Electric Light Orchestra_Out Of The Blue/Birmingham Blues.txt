Birmingham Blues Lyrics(indiscernible)
Working on the road across
This great big world
Yeah, I've been rolling like a stone
I never get back home
Yes, I've been long-gone
Boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues
I've been across the ocean
To the south sea isles
Yeah, I travelled to the east and west
For miles and miles and miles
And I've been long-gone
Boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues
Across the world (Across the world) I've seen
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But with a different name
Oh, I wouldn't change the things
I do for anything
But I'd just like to hear the message
Of the streets again
Give me a ticket
'Cause boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues
It may be kind of homely
But it sure is sweet
Industrial Revolution
Put it on its feet
But it's a long, long way
Boy, I've got the Birmingham Blues
Across the world (Across the world) I've seen
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But with a different name
I'll go and stay a while
And all the folks I meet
They'll say, "You won't stay long
You got them travellin' feet
You'll soon be long-gone
'Cause boy, you got the rest of the world blues."
Across the world (Across the world) I've seen
People and places (People and places)
Everywhere I've been (Don't you know it could be the same?)
But with a different name
Across the world
People and places (People and places)
Everywhere I've been
Across the world (Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But you know, it's got a different name
Across the world
People and places
Everywhere I've been...Embed
