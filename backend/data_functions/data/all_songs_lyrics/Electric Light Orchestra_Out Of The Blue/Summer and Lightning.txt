Summer and Lightning Lyrics
I have waited
For your love
For so long
How do I go on?
I have told you (Sha-la-la)
So many times (Sha-la-la)
It's no good (Sha-la-la)
You're treatin' me so wrong (Sha-la-la)

Out there so far away (so far away)
Above the sky will say
For you...

Here it comes again
It's all around me
It must be magic
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I can see you (I see you)
In my mind (in my mind)
The lost time (losin' time)
That you're savin'
I could reach out (I reach out)
And touch you (touchin' you)
What can I do (what can I do)?
The sun ain't shinin'
Out there so far away
Above the sky will say
For you
Only for you...

Here it comes again
(Summer and lightning)
It's all around me
(Summer and lightning)
It must be magic
(Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Hear it comes again
I can feel it, feel it, feel it, feel it
You, you, you...

Here it comes again
(Summer and lightning)
It's all around me
(Summer and lightning)
It must be magic
(Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, here it comes again
(Summer and lightning)
I can feel it
(Summer and lightning)
It's all around me
(Summer and lightning)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Summer and lightning)...Embed
