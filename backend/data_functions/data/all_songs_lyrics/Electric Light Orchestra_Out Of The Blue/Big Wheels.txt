Big Wheels Lyrics
Big wheels
Keep turning
They turn forever and ever

I've been thinkin' it over
So many times they say
You got it made
They never understand
The answer lies within your soul
Cause no one know which side
The coin will fall

Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
(Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
(Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin', turnin'

Save it for a rainy day
For when the cold wind blows
Just to see how they run
I thought they'd know
I tried my best
All I could do
But somehow, it was not enough for you
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
(Not enough for you)
Big wheels turnin' (no, no, no)
Baby, I know (no, no, no)
Big wheels turnin', turnin'
Turnin', turnin', turnin'

I remember the dead of night
A lonely light that shines
Upon the window
I see it all so clear
The tenderness, the silent tears
Out here in the pouring rain
Through cold dark waiting days
I see you standing there
I see the big wheels turnin'
Never endin', on and on they go

I think I'm goin' home
I think I'm gonna have to start again
It's rather sad
Because I've looked around
Can't seem to find
Whatever's always rollin'
Through my mind
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
(Through my mind)
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
Big wheels turnin', turnin'
Turnin', turnin', turnin'
I remember the dead of night
A lonely light that shines
Upon the window
I see it all so clear
The tenderness, the silent tears
Out here in the pouring rain
Through cold dark waiting days
I see you standing there
I see the big wheels turnin'
Never endin', on and on they go

Big wheels... big wheels1Embed
