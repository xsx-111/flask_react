Sweet Is the Night Lyrics
When the day is done and there's (nowhere to run)
And the people of the city have all lost and won
In your city dress you stand and stare (you stand and stare)
And you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair
And the light that shines
Paints a trace of sadness on the street
I wait, but I can't seem to get to you

Oh you start to sway, check your Cartier (it's getting late)
'Cause it's getting late, you can't afford to wait
So you move along where it's going on
And the people of the night are playing 'till the dawn
And the sun that shines paints a trace of sadness
In your eyes that cry, wishing and a-hoping, ooh

Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near

Well, you did your thing and you lost your wings
And you hurt so bad you lost everything
And the tears that fall on the city wall
Will fade away with the rays of morning light
That shines, and paints a smile across your pretty face
And I know everything is all right, hey all right
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
(Sweet is the night)

Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
(Now you are near)1Embed
