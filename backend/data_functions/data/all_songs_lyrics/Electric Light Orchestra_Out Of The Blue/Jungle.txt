Jungle Lyrics
I was standing in the jungle
I was feeling alright
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
I was wandering in the darkness
In the middle of the night
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
The moon began to shine
I saw a clearing ahead
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
But what's that going on?
I think I'm out of my head
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm

Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
Looka looka, koo la ley

A hundred animals
Were gathered 'round this night
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
And they were singing out a lovely song
Under the pale moonlight
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
I stood and stared for quite a while
Then a lion sang to me and smiled
"Come and join us if you so desire"
(They sang)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley
(And it started to rain)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley

I said, "Now please explain the meaning
Of this song you sing"
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
"Wondrous is our great blue ship
That sails around the mighty sun
And joy to everyone that rides along!"

(Oh, they sang)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley

(Ah, that's nice)
(And they danced!)
Pretty soon, I knew the tune
And we sat and sang under the moon
And the jungle rang in joyful harmony

(They sang)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley
(And it started to rain)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley

Wondrous is our great blue ship
That sails around the mighty sun
And joy to everyone that rides along!
(Chooka chooka, hoo la ley)2Embed
