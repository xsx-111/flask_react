Night in the City Lyrics
Standin' at the airport looking down the strip
She was drying her eyes, she was biting her lip
Seven-four-seven just left from gate eleven
And there's no turning round 'cause it's just leaving the ground
And gettin' higher (Higher)

Standing at the dock-side looking out to sea
When I saw her but she did not see me
There she stood with no hope because she'd missed the boat
And as her dreams sailed away she headed back for the day
Back to the city (City)

Night in the city, o-o-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city driving you insane

(In the city)
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
In the city (City)
Night in the city, o-o-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city drivin' you insane

I was running kinda lonely at the city place
I waited for an hour, I never saw her face
Crazy ladies that wait and slide around like a snake
I just can't take anymore, I'm going in through the door
Into the city (City)

I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
Driving you insane

Night in the city, o-o-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city
Driving you insane
Driving you insane
Driving you insane1Embed
