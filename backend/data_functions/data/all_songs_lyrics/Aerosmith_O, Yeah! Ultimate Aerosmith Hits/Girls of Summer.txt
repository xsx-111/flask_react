Girls of Summer Lyrics
When winter hush turns summer pink
In half the time it takes to blink
But it all depends on what you think
About the girls of summer
When all you think of all day long
Is a pretty face inside a song
With a thought like that you can't go wrong
About the girls of summer
Oh yeah... (Do you know... everybody's talking 'bout)

Some girls are all about it
Some girls they love to let it fly
Some girls can't live without it
Some girls are born to make you cry

Over and over again

My favorite thing that drives me wild
Is when a city girl walks a country mile
For the boy she loves God bless the child
Inside the girls of summer
Oh yeah... (Do you know... everybody's talking 'bout)

Yeah... over and over again
Yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah... yeah

They get you climbing the walls
They get you caught in their spell
They get you speaking in tongues
Could this be Heaven or Hell
To fall in love twice a day
Is such a sweet price to pay
Se - vous - play
The best things about life are free
The pussywillow up your tree
To the one who climbs
They'll always be the girl... yeah


Some girls can't live without it
Some girls got twenty reasons why

Over & over & over & over & over1Embed
