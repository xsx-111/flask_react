Theme from Spider Man Lyrics
Spider-man, Spider-man
Does whatever a spider can
Spins a web, sweet surprise
Catches thieves, just like flies
Look out! Here comes the Spider-man!
Is he strong? Listen, Bud!
He's got radioactive blood
Can he swing from a thread?
No escape from his spiderweb
Look out! There goes the Spider
In the chill of night
At the scene of the crime
Like a laserlight
He arrives just in time
Spider-man, Spider-man
Doin the impossible and why because he can
Spider-Man, Spider-man
Doin what he gotta get accordin to the plan, look out!
Life is a great big bang-up
Wherever there's a hang-up
You'll find the Spider-man!Embed
