Lay It Down Lyrics
Ruby red her lips were on fire
Do me with a kiss if you please
Tell me what'chor sweet heart desires
Tell me how you want it to be
Cause if it's love you want then you won't mind
A little tenderness
That sometimes is so hard to find

(Lay it down)
Lay it down
Make it alright
(Lay it down)
Lay it down
I'll hold you so tight
(Lay it down)
Oh... before the morning light
It's gonna be alright
Oh... lay it down
Come and lay it down tonight

Tell me how you feel when we make love
Tell me is it real or just make believe
You will never know what'chor made of
Until you open up your heart to receive
Cause if the love you got's that same old crime
We're talking tenderness that's so hard to find
And I'm getting behind you

Do you remember them times talking in your sleep
With a pocket full'a rubbers you never could keep
From your best friends lover you dreamt about then
When you pulling up the covers the voices in your head
Say if you want it bad
Don't ever let it slip away

Cause if it's love you want and tenderness... yeah


Oh... lay it down
Gonna lay it down tonight
Gonna come around tonight
You got to lay it downEmbed
