Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees) Lyrics
You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

You think you're in love
Like it's a real sure thing
But every time you fall
You get your ass in a sling
You used to be strong
But now it's "ooh baby please"
Because falling in love is so hard on the knees

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

We was making love when you told me that you loved me
I thought ol' cupid, he was taking aim
I was believer when you told me that you loved me
And then you called me someone else's name
Yeah!

There ain't gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees
You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

Chip off the old block
Man, you're so much like your sister
My fantasizin' must be outta luck
My old libido has been blowin' a transistor
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck, yeah

I'm jonesing on love
Yeah, I got the DT's
You say that we will
But there ain't no guarantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees
Yeah!

What are you looking for
It's got to be hardcore
Must be some kind of nouveau riche
Is this your only chance
Or some hypnotic trance
Let's get you on a tighter leash
Own it own it own it

You're so bad you're so bad you're so
You're so bad you're so bad you're so

You ain't that good
Is what you said down to the letter
But you like the way I hold the microphone
Sometimes I'm good, but when I'm bad
I'm even better
Don't give me no lip
I've got enough of my own

There ain't gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone
And your girlfriend agrees
That falling in love is so hard on the knees

I'm jonesing on love
Yeah, I got the DT's
You say that we will
But there ain't no guarantees
I'm major in love
But in all minor keys
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the kneesEmbed
