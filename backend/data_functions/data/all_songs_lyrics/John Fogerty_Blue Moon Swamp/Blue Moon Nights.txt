Blue Moon Nights LyricsHelp me fellas
I'm feelin' kind-a weak
The way I'm livin' just ain't right
I need somebody t' watch over me
All my blue moon nights
I want a girl to take me by the hand
Follow me right down the line
Hold me gently while we dance
All my blue moon nights
Heaven only knows I don't want to be
Just a fool, passin' through
Won't you send me an angel to walk with me
All my blue moon nights
Help me fellas
It's gettin' kind-a late
Runnin' out of precious time
She might pass me while I waste
All my blue moon nights
Heaven only knows I don't want to be
Just a fool, passin' through
Won't you send me an angel to walk with me
All my blue moon nightsEmbed
