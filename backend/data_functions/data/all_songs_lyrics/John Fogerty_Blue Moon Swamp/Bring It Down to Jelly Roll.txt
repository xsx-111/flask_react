Bring It Down to Jelly Roll LyricsWell, if you want
To ease your mind
You just go on
Take it to the river
When you're down
Well, that's alright
You just bring it down to jelly roll
We're gonna run
A-jump and shout
We're gonna slide
Way back in the country
There's a place
Where they treat you right
You just bring it down to jelly roll
The little girls
Way down south
They got their way
Honey drippin' from their mouth
If you ever get some luck
You just bring it down to jelly roll
Now look at me
Lord, I ain't got a dime
But I can dance
Lord, I'm jumping all the time
I live honey, straight to the bone
You just bring it down to jelly roll
Well, if you want
To ease your mind
You just go on
Take it to the river
When you're down
Well, that's alright
You just bring it down to jelly rollEmbed
