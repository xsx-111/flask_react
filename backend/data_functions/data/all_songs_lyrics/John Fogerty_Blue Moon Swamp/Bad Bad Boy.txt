Bad Bad Boy LyricsBad bad boy
Yoe're drivin' me crazy
Bad bad boy
Shame on you
Shame on you
Where you been all night
Messin' with your friends
You act so mean
And you talk so funny
There you go again
Bad bad boy
You won't amount to nothin'
Bad bad boy
Shame on you
Shame on you
Where you been
What you been doin'
Where you been
What you been doin'
Bad bad boy
Bad bad boy
Can't you be more like your brother
Bad bad boy
Shame on you
Shame on you
Where you been
What you been doin'
Where you been
What you been doin'
Bad bad boyEmbed
