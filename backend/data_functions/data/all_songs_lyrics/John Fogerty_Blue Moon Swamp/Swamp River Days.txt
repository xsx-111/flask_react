Swamp River Days LyricsTwo-lane
Shinin' in the july dust
Heat risin' off the road
Out in front of my truck
Pulled my pick-up over the hill
Down the slide gravel through the cat-tails
Give me those swamp river days again
Sat down in the shade of a cotton wood tree
Pretty soon the swamp critters' callin' me
Skinny river kids swim in my mind
Hucklebums on cane-pole time
Give me those swamp river days again
Old memories out in the crick
Playin' hooky with a hobo stick
Old memories startin' to fade
Take me away
Cody river playin' on the radio
Takes me back to a girl I used to know
Sweet Susie do you think about me
That was good as it's ever gonna be
Give me those swamp river days again
Give me those swamp river days againEmbed
