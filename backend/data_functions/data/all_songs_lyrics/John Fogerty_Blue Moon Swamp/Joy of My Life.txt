Joy of My Life LyricsI tiptoed in the room
I know you got to have your rest
She says, 'Come lay beside me
I've been waitin' since you left'
She's sweet to me
Must be the luckiest man alive
And did I tell you baby
You are the joy of my life
First time that I saw you
Ooh, you took my breath away
I might not get to heaven
But I walked with the Angels that day
She takes me by the hand
I am the luckiest man alive
And did I tell you baby
You are the joy of my life
Some may have their riches
Some may have their worldly fame
Long as I have you
I'll treasure each and every day
Just take me by the hand
I am the luckiest man alive
And did I tell you baby
You are the joy of my life
And did I tell you baby
You are the joy of my lifeEmbed
