Rattlesnake Highway LyricsIt may look easy
When you look at me
But it took years of effort
To become the mess that you see
Now what kind of woman
Take you for a ride
Down the rattlesnake highway
An' leave you busted up inside
All busted up inside
Smiles like a cobra
With her rattlesnake eyes
'n leave you for dead on the highway
Just mumblin' at the sky
She did me wrong
She did me wrong
She did me wrong
Tell me...she did me
Smiles like a cobra
With her rattlesnake eyes
'n leave you for dead on the highway
Just mumblin' at the sky
Now she did me wrong
She did me so wrong
She did me wrong
You know she did me so wrong
Get me outta hereEmbed
