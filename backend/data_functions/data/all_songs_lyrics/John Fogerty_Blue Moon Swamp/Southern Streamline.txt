Southern Streamline LyricsMama I'm on fire
Old flame
Sweet desire
Comin' on the midnight
Comin' on the midnight train
Rollin' steel and thunder
Bring my baby back again
Roll on down the line
Big wheels rollin' right on time
Hear that whistle blowin'
Hear that engine roar and whine
Take care of my baby
Ridin' on that southern streamline
Well I got a little letter this morning
Just about the break of day
Bluebird ringin' my doorbell
Rollin' my blues away
Said honey when we go steppin'
Long about Saturday night
So head it down to the station
An' everything'll be alright
Honey what's that sound
Big wheels rollin' homeward bound
See that smokestack sparkin'
Lightin' up a purple sky
Take care of my baby
Ridin' on that southern streamline
Well I got a little letter this morning
Just about the break of day
Bluebird ringin' my doorbell
Rollin' my blues away
Said honey babe we'll go steppin'
Long about Saturday night
So head it down to the station
An' everything'll be alright
Mama I'm on fire
Old flame
Sweet desire
Comin' on the midnight
Honey let your little light shine
Rollin' steel and thunder
Ridin' on that southern streamline
Take care of my baby
Ridin' on that southern streamlineEmbed
