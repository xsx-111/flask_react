Hot Rod Heart Lyrics
1,2, 1,2,3,4!
Ooh, let's go ridin'
Cruisin' down the open road
We can put the top down
Listen to the radio
Big ol' Buick
And a big ol' sky
Wheels on fire
And I'll tell you why
I got a hot rod heart
Ooh, let's go prowlin'
Sneakin' like we used to do
Way back in the country
Cut across the cornfields too
Big ol' Harley
And a big ol' moon
Big ol' 'gator
Puttin' on the zoom
I got a hot rod heart
Got a one-way ticket to the open road
Come on
Got a red line engine
And I'm rarin' to go
Put the pedal to the metal
If you want to ride
If you want to ride
Let's go
Hyow!

Ooh, let's go ridin'
Rollin' down the open road
We can put the top down
Listen to the radio
Big ol' Buick
And a big ol' sky
Wheels on fire
And I'll tell you why
I got a hot rod heart
Got a one-way ticket to the open road
Come on (Hey!)
Got a red line engine
And I'm rarin' to go
Put the pedal to the metal
If you want to ride
If you want to ride
If you want to ride
Let's go
Doo-dobby dobby-doo doo- dobby heh hah!
Ooh, let's go ridin'
Ooh, let's go ridin'
Ooh, let's go ridin'
Ooh, let's go ridin'
Ooh, let's go ridin'
Câ€™mon!Embed
