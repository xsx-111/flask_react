The Goodbye Look Lyrics
The surf was easy on the day I came to stay
On this quiet island in the bay
I remember a line of women all in white
The laughter and the steel bands at night
All the Americans are gone except for two
The embassy's been hard to reach
There's been talk and lately a bit of action after dark
Behind the big casino on the beach

The rules are changed, it's not the same
It's all new players in a whole new ball game

Last night, I dreamed of an old lover dressed in gray
I've had this fever now since yesterday
Wake up, darling, they're knocking
The Colonel's standing in the sun
With his stupid face the glasses and the gun

I know what happens, I read the book
I believe I just got the goodbye look
(I believe I just got the goodbye look)
I believe I just got the goodbye...
(I believe I just got the goodbye look)
Won't you pour me a Cuban breeze, Gretchen?

The rules are changed, it's not the same
It's all new players in a whole new ball game

I know a fellow with a motor launch for hire
A skinny man with two-tone shoes
'Cause tonight, they're arranging a small reception just for me
Behind the big casino by the sea

I know what happens, I read the book
I believe I just got the goodbye look
(I believe I just got the goodbye look)
I believe I just got the goodbye...
(I believe I just got the goodbye look)Embed
