Maxine LyricsSome say that we're reckless
They say we're much too young
Tell us to stop before we've begun
We've got to hold out till graduation
Try to hang on Maxine
While the world is sleeping
We meet at Lincoln Mall
Talk about life, the meaning of it all
Try to make sense of the suburban sprawl
Try to hang on Maxine
Mexico City is like another world
Nice this year they say
You'll be my senorita
In jeans and pearls
But first let's get off this highway
We'll move up to Manhattan
And fill the place with friends
Drive to the coast and drive right back again
One day we'll wake up, make love but 'til then
Try to hang on Maxine1Embed
