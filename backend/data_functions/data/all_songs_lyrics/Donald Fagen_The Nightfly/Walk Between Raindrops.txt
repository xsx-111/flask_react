Walk Between Raindrops LyricsA shadow crossed the blue Miami sky
As we hit the causeway by the big hotels
We fought
Now I can't remember why
After all the words were said and tears were gone
We vowed we'd never say goodbye
When we kissed we could hear the sound of thunder
As we watched the regulars rush the big hotels
We kissed again as the showers swept the Florida shore
You opened your umbrella
But we walked between the raindrops back to your door
Oh Miami!
In my dreams I can hear the sound of thunder
I can see the causeway by the big hotels
That happy day we'll find each other on that Florida shore
You'll open your umbrella
And we'll walk between the raindrops back to your door
We'll walk between the raindrops
Between the raindrops
Walk between the raindrops back to your doorEmbed
