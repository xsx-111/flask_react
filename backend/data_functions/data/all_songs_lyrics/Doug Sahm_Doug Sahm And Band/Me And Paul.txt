Me And Paul LyricsIt's been rough and rocky traveling'
I finally got my feet back on the ground
After takin' several readings I find out that
My mind's still fairly sound
I thought Nashville was the roughest
But I guess I said the same about them all
They said we look suspicious
But I think they like to pick on me and Paul
Almost busted in Laredo but for reasons
That I'd rather not disclose
But if you're stayin' in a motel there and leave
Just don't leave nothin' in your clothes
And at the airport in Milwaukee
They refused to let us board the plane at all
They said we looked suspicious
But I believe they like to pick on me and Paul
It's been rough and rocky travelin'
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After takin' several readings I'm surprised
To find my mind's still fairly sound
On a package show in Buffalo with us
And Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride
The show was long and we're just sittin' there
And we'd come to play and not just for the ride
Well we drank a lot of whiskey so I don't know
If we went on that night at all
I don't think they even missed us
I guess Buffalo ain't geared for me and Paul
It's been rough and rocky travelin'
But I'm finally standing upright on the ground
After takin' several readings I'm surprised
To find my mind's still fairly soundEmbed
