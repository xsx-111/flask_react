I Get Off LyricsI never thought it would end this way
Darling the last stop boarded just one day
Seen you on the corner with every man around
You don't get it lately kneeling down
Your so that far out now
And you're working in my head
I get off, I get off, I get off
I get off on you
Off on you girl, off on you girl
So if you check and you find a room
Sad old heart and you feel it too
Come on over to mine
Let me hold you in my hand
You know I get it
Yeah, babe I understand
It's all for the best now
I love you through and through
I get off, I get off, I get off
I get off on you
Off on you babe, off on you babeEmbed
