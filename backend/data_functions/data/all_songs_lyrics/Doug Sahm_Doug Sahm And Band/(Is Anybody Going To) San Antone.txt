(Is Anybody Going To) San Antone LyricsRain dripping off the brim of my hat
It sure looks cold today
Here I am walkin down 66
Wish she hadn't done me this way
Sleeping under a table in a roadside park
A man could wake up dead
But it sure seems warmer than it did
Sleeping in our king size bed
Is anybody going to San Antone
Or Phoenix Arizona
Any place is all right
As long as I can forget I've ever known her
Wind whipping' down the neck of my shirt
Like I ain't got nothin' on
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain
Than what I was fightin' at home
Is anybody going to San Antone or Phoenix Arizona
Any place is all right
As long as I can forget I've ever known her
Yonder comes a truck with the U.S. mail
People writin' letters back home
Well tomorrow she'll want me back again
And I'll be just as gone
Is anybody going to San Antone or Phoenix Arizona
Any place is all right
As long as I can forget I've ever known herEmbed
