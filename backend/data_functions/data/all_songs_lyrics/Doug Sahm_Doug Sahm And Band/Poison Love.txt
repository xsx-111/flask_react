Poison Love LyricsAll that poison love has shamed
The life blood in my heart and soul dear
And I know my life will never be the same
All my pleadings has all been in vain
For you and you alone dear
And I know that you are guilty of the shame
Into each life some rain must fall
For one and one alone dear
And the love I chose was not for me
Cause your love has just now let me down
And left my heart a cryin'
But I know that you are guilty of the shame
All that poison love has shamed…

Into each life some rain must fall
For one and one alone dear
And I know the love I chose was not for me
But your love has always put me down
And now I feel outside dear
And I know that you are guilty of the shame
All that poison love has shamed…

My heart cries out for you each night
Alone when each days closing
And I know this love is surely not for me
But my poison love
I've got to live within my heart and soul, dear
And I know that you are guilty of the shame
All that poison love has shamed…Embed
