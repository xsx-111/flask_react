Your Friends LyricsThis case has gone the wings of the bird
Until next time to Bluesville
Down Memory Laneâ€¦
Don't let your friends turn you against me baby
They ain't given you one red copper cent
Don't let your friends turn you against me baby
They ain't given you one red copper cent
When I leave you this time baby
Wonder who's gonna pay your house rent
Don't let your friends turn you against me baby
Then let your conscience be your guide
Don't let your friends turn you against me baby
This time let your conscience be your guide
When I leave you this time baby
I wonder if your friend is gonna stay by your side
Your friends, your friends say that I'm evil
I hunt the women like the dog hunt a bone
I can't be doing too much wrong baby
Everyday I bring my paycheck home
Don't let you friends turn you against me baby
They ain't giving you one red copper cent
When I leave you this time baby
Wonder who's gonna pay your house rent
Mercy

Don't let your friends turn you against me baby
They ain't given you one red copper cent
Don't let your friends turn you against me baby
They ain't given you one red copper cent
When I leave you this time baby
Wonder who's gonna pay your house rent
Do-do-dup
I'm gonna stay right by your sideEmbed
