Blues Stay Away From Me LyricsBlues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Time goes by
Still I can't be free
Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Time goes by
Still I can't be free
Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Time goes by
Still I can't be free
Tears so many I can't see
Tears so many I can't see
Time goes by
Still I can't get free
Blues stay away from me
Blues why don't you let me be
Time goes by
Still I can't be freeEmbed
