Faded Love LyricsAs I look at the letters that you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking' of
It was in the springtime that we were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin', more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars the above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love

As I think of the good times, the treasures we had
As I watch the mating of the dove
It was in the springtime to me you were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin', more and more every day
As heaven would miss the stars the above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
And remember our faded loveEmbed
