Hot Pants, Pt. 1 LyricsOne-two, one-two-three, uh!
Hot pants, hey, hot pants, uh, smokin'
Hot pants, smokin' that, hot pants
That's where it's at a-that's where it's at
Take your fine self home
It looks much better than time
My fever keeps growin'
Girl, you're blowin' my mind
Thinkin' of losin' that funky feelin', don't, uh!
Cause you got to use just what you got
To get just what you want-a
Hey, huh
Hot pants! Hey! Hot pants, smokin'!
Hot pants make ya sure of yourself -good God
You walk like you got the only lovin' left, hey
So brother, if you're thinkin' of losin' that feelin'
Then don't, ha
Cause a woman got to use what she got
To get just what she wants, hey!
Hey, hot pants
A-look a-hot pants won't make ya dance
But as slick as you are, ha, YOU make the pants
Uh! Hey, brother, do ya like it?
The girl over there with the funky pants on, ha
She can, ah, do the chicken all night long
The girl over there with the hot pants on, uh
She can do the Funky Broadway all night long
The girl over there with the hot pants on
Filthy McNasty all night long
Get down, uh, the one over there
With the mini dress, ha
I ain't got time, I still dig that mess
Get down! But I like the hot pants
Hey! I like hot pants
OH! Bring it home!
One more! Hit me! Hey!
Bring it home! Bring it home!
Uh! Bring it on home
Bring it on home...Embed
