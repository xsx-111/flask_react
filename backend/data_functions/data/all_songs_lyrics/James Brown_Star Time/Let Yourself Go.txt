Let Yourself Go Lyrics
One, two
One, two, three

Hey everybody, let me tell you the news

It isn't just soul
It isn't just soul
It's just rhythm and
Just rhythm and blues

Hey baby, let yourself go

You're too sharp, you aren't too sharp
Aren't too sharp, again, one more time
Aren't too sharp, aren't too sharp
You're just too stupid to let me dance

I want to prance, I've got to talk
Just let me walk, I've got to, I've got to, got to
Hey everybody, tell you the news
Hey everybody, let me tell you the news

You aren't too sharp, aren't too sharp
Aren't too sharp, you're just too
I want to dance, I've got to prance
I want to feel the love with you

You've got to feel
You just got to, got to
I've got to feel, give it to me
You've got to, let me

Let me, let me have it
I've got to, got to, I've got to
I've got to, I've got to, let me
Oh, I've got to, tell me, I've got toEmbed
