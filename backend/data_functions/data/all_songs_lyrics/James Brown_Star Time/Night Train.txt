Night Train Lyrics
All aboard for night train

Miami, florida
Atlanta, georgia
Raleigh, north carolina
Miami, florida
Atlanta, georgia
Raleigh, north carolina
Washington d.c
Oh, and richmond, virginia too
Baltimore, maryland
Philadelphia
New york city
Take me home, boston massachusetts
And don't forget new orleans
The home of the blues

Oh, yeah, night train
Night train, night trainEmbed
