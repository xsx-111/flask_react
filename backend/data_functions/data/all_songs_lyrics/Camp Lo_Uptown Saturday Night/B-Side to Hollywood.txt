B-Side to Hollywood Lyrics
Ayo, watch that thing (cause we comin' around)
We settin' Camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money, money (Hollywood)
Money, money sunshine (and everythin' fine)
Ayo, watch that thing (cause we comin' around)
We settin' camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money, money (Hollywood)
Money, money sunshine (and keep it jig' vine, so check it)

Okay, now I'm gon' make this easy
We're gonna take this shit straight to your EP
Meet me with red carpet and some roses, and you knows this
Lovin' makes them beat down for your fakin'
So catch these holly with hologram stands while I'm bleekin'
And I be feekin', De La thinks it's hot as we can
And keep a sunny sorrow until this half-way goldie
And now you've shown me, niggas that do it like De La
Lay with Layla, it's the Lo livin' holiday Hilton, stop lyin'
Stop denyin', stop the blood clot cryin'
Fresh like chef, want a slice? We heist and keep flyin'
Now I'm tyin' the ginger pessimist MC
Peace to Steve, Tristar, Big Mo, Snooze, and Julianne

Ayo, watch that thing (cause we comin' around)
We settin' Camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money, money (Hollywood)
Money, money sunshine (and everythin' fine)
Ayo, watch that thing (cause we comin' around)
We settin' camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money, money (Hollywood)
Money, money sunshine (and keep it jig' vine, so check it)
I say, Rickety Rocket was my favorite cartoon
And after marriage comes the honeymoon
Who love Popeye, is Alice the Goon?
Ate the Honeycomb cereal with my big spoon
Woke up so late it was half past noon
Had to gather my connections and form a platoon
Niggas don't see it, but the war come soon
Got the Ummah, got the remedy, so son, stay tuned
And if I had a month to pick, it'd be June
I get up in your hide like Daniel Boone
Newspaper reads "Dove, #1 Tycoon"
Yo, we start up off this piece and give the next man room

Ayo, watch that thing (cause we comin' around)
We settin' Camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money, money (Hollywood)
Money, money sunshine (and everythin' fine)
Ayo, watch that thing (cause we comin' around)
We settin' camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money, money (Hollywood)
Money, money sunshine (and keep it jig' vine, so check it)

And spillin' moonshine, sucka
I be kickin' like Bruce Li, Chinese Connection
Mamacita dig the Cheeba, satin complexion
Talkin' some shit like I'm relatives of Cassius Clay and
When he beat Smokin' Joe Frazier
Hear come the lower, with the (meanie, meanie, meanie, meanie)
Come but, ain't you another slick on the flip city
This shit, brickhouse, shit on my bed
Meet me copper, spoon in a loaf of bread, baby
Can I get a baby to go with the boom?
And the bam, as long as the shit ain't sparin'
They closet the Camp, right on Pam, when she do the splits
So I can see Cheeba's greatest hits
Ayo, watch that thing (cause we comin' around)
We settin' Camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money, money (Hollywood)
Money, money sunshine (and everythin' fine)
Ayo, watch that thing (cause we comin' around)
We settin' camp on these here grounds
Cause we gots to make money, money (Hollywood)
Money, money sunshine (and keep it jig' vine, so check it)

And keep it jig' vine, y'all
Yo, where the party at? (with lower, lower)
Yo, where the party at? (with De La, De La)
Yo, where the party at? (with lower, lower)
Yo, where the party at? (with De La, De La)
Yo, where the party at? (with Trugoy, Trugoy)
Yo, where the party at? (with G-Suede, G-Suede)
Yo, where the party at? (with Cheeba, Cheeba)
Yo, where the party at? (with Maseo, goddamn)
Yo, where the party at? (with Posdnuos)
Or like, Jimmy Cracked Corn1Embed
