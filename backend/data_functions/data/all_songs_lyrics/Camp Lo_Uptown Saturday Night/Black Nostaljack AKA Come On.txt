Black Nostaljack AKA Come On Lyrics
If you from the BX connect, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the BK soufflé, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the cherry QB, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the NY you fly, nigga (Nigga come on, nigga come on)

Now here we are star, pour the sarsparilla
I'm the Donizetti on the Van Wyck Express
We got the emporio and vino just for the keeper (keeper)
And yes he be the Cheeba (Cheeba)
And yes I be the Suede-a (Suede-a)
So gimme zigga zigga (thicka)
And we can get with Rodrigi
The seventh heaven cloud is for my kufi and dashiki
So you see me on the upper
But it's always the Lo-a (Lo-a)
We make it Hollywood cuz Diamond Crooks is takin' over

And yes yes you to the beat and
Scores like 10 on my IQ test
Stay fly with the vibes so I'm so funky fresh
I rocks to the east, I flows to the west
This Max Julien number one draft pick
A finger to the rest, here we go for the Knicks
It's like that super fat catch a heart attack
Then smoke the shooby dooby with the black nostaljack
If you from the BX connect, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the BK soufflé, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the cherry QB, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the NY you fly, nigga (Nigga come on, nigga come on)
If you from the BX connect, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the BK soufflé, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the cherry QB, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the NY you fly, nigga (Nigga come on, nigga come on)

No not she, I know it can't be
Hair so sweet how sweet can they be?
I rock around the clock then I run up on your block
I give the cat a smack to the rhythm tick tock
But who he? You know it only be the Sonny Chee
And who that? The kin to Errol Flynn, Geechi Suede
I ride up on a wave and pursue the Gay Blade
Noxema Jackson beat her like she stole something, brah

Yo, she call me Poitier
She had the Oregano stashed in the Hathaway
So know wew hipsiano to the Barry Cotto Height
And now we got the fuzz flash and crazy fucking lights
The diamond life is trife
But we can get this lotto so get Rollo and the blammer
We meet them in Aruba get the goods down in Savannah
You know it can't be them so it's got to be Lo-a
We make it Hollywood cuz Diamond Crooks is takin' over
If you from the BX connect, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the BK soufflé, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the cherry QB, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the NY you fly, nigga (Nigga come on, nigga come on)
If you from the BX connect, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the BK soufflé, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the cherry QB, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the NY you fly, nigga (Nigga come on, nigga come on)

One for the money, two is for the Ebeneezer
We used to stick these cats for all they masters and they visas
And we do it on our leisure
I keep a wavy Caesar
I used to rock a bubblegoose while trotting to The Fever
Now we in the Estee Lauder
And Nina Ricci saga
The viking from Corona with tequila for my campers
I said it once before and I'm sayin it all over
We make it Hollywood cuz Diamond Crooks is takin' over

Some cats from BX on the one and the two
We sippin on the booze with a little Big League Chew
Somebody pulled a heist but they just don't know who
I wonder how we do heisting jewels, how we do
I'm in it every line with a little bit of ooh
I do swing my things, but I practice Gun Fu
Now this here be the end so we will be seeing you
Nigga come on
Nigga come on
If you from the BX connect, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the BK soufflé, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the cherry QB, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the NY you fly, nigga (Nigga come on, nigga come on)
If you from the BX connect, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the BK soufflé, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the cherry QB, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the NY you fly, nigga (Nigga come on, nigga come on)
If you from the BX connect, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the BK soufflé, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the cherry QB, nigga (Nigga come on)
If you from the NY you fly, nigga (Nigga come on, nigga come on)

I get fly (you get fly) heads collect
BK soufflé south QB (you get fly)
Camp Lo in the mafi (you get fly)
Always move like that one time for y'all (you get fly)
Get fly
Get fly
The rhythm is all over you
The rhythm is all over you
The rhythm is all over you
The rhythm is all over you3Embed
