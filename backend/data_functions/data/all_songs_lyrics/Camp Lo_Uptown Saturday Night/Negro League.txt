Negro League Lyrics
Word to magnanimous
Tactic, exord
Extensive foul play
Off hand, anti-fraud
Odd lead odd squads
Espionage to clean up
Forgettin' “can’t scam a schemer”;
Never choking on the adrenaline
Peep the sequence
Frequent I talk
In money

Killa black shazaming
Half the Octagon
Negro League shadow dancin'
In Madison Square drinkin'
Shasta Karacha
Suede, Sonny Cheeba
The God, Jimmy Counterfeit
Bronx men we bronze shit on Vanity, Fair cats
And we tear that
Out your back bruh
In front of this brother
Was revenge of the Slim Jim
Actions speaks louder than words
So what I’m talking now
No lolli-gagging if you want to be heard, absurd
Observe and acknowledge the Karachian jewel
Drop an educated fool
Knocking out unless you sacrifice
And that help us break you
Future block
Life lock
Shackle down for all my older brothers told
Shit ‘bout to get sick!

Yeah, we position this excursion
For some emergent
Armed Moschino
Unauthentic Gambino
Finer spot than real
My Cleo from China Clint chint
And a crimp off from credo
Torpedo the hummer a menace
In the fall of Versace
Phases
Cause in the rising of the un-forbidden true
And living Bronx emcees that do this
For love and nothing else
Keep it Lo'!
See him slay make him prove the talk that he about
The entire genuine yeah the year no doubt
See him slay make him prove the talk that he about
The entire genuine quick to figure ears out

It’s time to form a Wachi clan
Out of Kemosabe fab
So I drop Karachi dan on Illuminati’s plans;
I remember I used to celebrate Christmas on Halloween:
Give'em Hell then take they greens of valuable
Property
Now instead of fakin' it
It ain’t too late to lace with
A Mason for some use of information
For footoodle penetration

Yeah, I’m combing Rome in a tomb
Fit for Zeus
Acting Columbo
Draping Kahlúa
Pulling Waco out on cats
The Zanzibar
Suede señor
And my cuspidor;
Salvador emperor of Ecuador
Don-a-Telly
Computed, accurate, nominated, acquitted
We shitted
I’m presentin' the Negro League on a platter!
Unusual
Anarchist the slick slim
Jim
Broad stalk til I’m all in
Intertwined with the tie that binds
Killing'em like spine
Decayed days past time
Next to me be none gettin' crumbs
Wiggas done stunts
Third villain stab felt then slumps

Yo one’s for the Cheeba
Deuce for the slim Jim
Tre' for the G Suede
And Quad for Karacha
Fantastic Four
We dont ask for yo insight;
Satin cavaliers of con-creters
What it be like
Each spot northeast conference champs
To the cup switch;
This Negro league shit
Prevails, now we hissed her!

See him slay make him prove the talk that he about
The entire genuine yeah the year no doubt
See him slay make him prove the talk that he about
The entire genuine quick to figure ears out1Embed
