Say Word Lyrics
The Suede say, "Shoot it up"
'Bout to get booted out, Johnston
Phillip Bronston with no magic wand
Mega bomb
Nova blacka-black leaves sweet cheeba water
Kobra Khan, no gangstarr
Levitate, I'm a humble threat on a nickel plate
Draggin' skate all over the state
Bronx ice, core silver skies, alley parkways
All over the stairways, Cheeba

Cheeba cheeba, y'all
Holy heat seeker
Foxy chiquita
Light the tequila
Amarett-ah, drop the convincer
Penny heat on and latin quarters do to La Bamba
Flight of the shogun, ejecting the parachute trooper

Black flames, masquerades
Lay shades in the dark
With no heart, but came back to life
When they heard the art
We launching from start
Scarred for these time slides
Black diamonds on hot china odds
Off the land, airborne drawin' off the sugar flats
Lo-a mats acquitted the Academy awards
Banana splittin' Casanova Brown
Spankin' that leather with skimmer
Welcome to jigga, cash hand
Lookie lookie here
Velvet velour, mix 'em together
Two sisters, Ménage à trois in the cash bar
Where I marinate
Meltin' on ass, Hershey bar
In the Sahara
Scraping the walls and walking tall

(Say word)
Never endin' high
Singin' superfly
Only if it's live, we live
(Say word)
Never endin' high
Singin' superfly
Only if it's live, we live
(Say word)
Never endin' high
Singin' superfly
Only if it's live, we live
(Say word)
Never endin' high
Singin' superfly
Only if it's live, we live
First I cut it to the left
Then I boogie to the right, dig it
Puncture in the palisades with Mr. Midnight
Menu for murder, Saratoga Fahrenheit
Top tasco for the site
Then I party down with Foxy Brown
Around the canopy
Pardon me, the Sonny Cheeba
Only plead the jungle prix
Now I'm pourin' vodka
On top of the diva
Lay her on the dock
Why the submarine slide through, yeah

German choice liquors
Every bone crush
Sugar rush
Reefers on the roundup
Chop ice
Only live life on the up and up

Broads
My Cherie Amour through the corridor
Mixing on the floor
Where we contemplate five thousand styles
Hit the brick house
Chit the rawhide, high-dee-high-dee-high
Diamond crooks hailin' from Coolie to Hingham High
Panther walk
Who we sellin' it?
Never endin' high
Illuminati out

(Say word)
Never endin' high
Singin' superfly
Only if it's live, we live
(Say word)
Never endin' high
Singin' superfly
Only if it's live, we live
(Say word)
Never endin' high
Singin' superfly
Only if it's live, we live
(Say word)
Never endin' high
Singin' superfly
Only if it's live, we live

We liveEmbed
