Krystal Karrington Lyrics
On and on and some try to do this
Yes y'all to the Camp lo
On and on and some try to do this
Yes y'all to the Camp lo

I get Krystal Karrington ice rock gritty
Carlito influenced tea flashers, Acapulco homicide scene
Second to catch it
First to feel it when I peel it
In the hall wit my orchestra, orchestratin my plans

Gifted Caramela, cinderella hold a fella tight
Make the octopussy do the watusi for the night
Call me by first name - Cheeba, sip the tang divas
In my sinasex get the intersect, it's the kid
But she make me wanna holla pass a dollar wit glass
Sucky, sucky for the nookie, meditatin on that ass
Doctor feel good, but it feel good when I splash
Get me high make me eat the hunky pie, Seaworld

We gone navigate the underground, blammin out Metropolis
"How you rock to this?" said the 85 I take my steez
Turnin towards Kahlua, knew I shouldn't a ran it through her
Now she play my shadow, Eliot Ness ego
We could take her to the Lieu 'cuz Cheeba make them unfold
Took my scammer s'now old, meditate on this one
Check I'm freezin wit the flame I put the blame on tough job
Generatin low life, Geechi Suede c'est la vie
Shook it off, now start to say one Bogart
Caca, Caca convince her and bulletproof heart
Its swift ice burglars on clips don't slip
They shift the diamonds we suck on my crew and lucky stiffs

On and on and some try to do this
Yes y'all to the Camp lo
On and on and some try to do this
Yes y'all to the Camp lo

Above the aquapool, hovercrafts teleport my lubricant
Golden axe, who's the drunken monk, uno delegate
Margarita glinch, glare a cannon out my trench
Welcome back to Fairy, Sonny Cheeba eye on glory

(Count to ten) I freaks my quarter blood techniques and
Don't fiend the pimp for his doublemint (fuck that)
Dig this, game genie pourin Riunite and a buttist
Sustain that gain while I free fall
(Lets do this) Hoppin, satin not jivin
Hijackin trains like (everybody get some)
Its like that ho hat, elephants speak up
Ned the Wino Jones and, pardon if I break up
Protectin heatsinking signals, got my henchman in Malia
Convincin Kashmir runnin cat scans on sequence
Then we Shalamar assassinate the seminar
Samarai to symphony hit the vault, flee the globe
Dynamo dinero, crusade genie casino
Cheeba ride the rhino, royal rubies in Reno
Venezuela electric, twistin trees Tahiti
Forty thieves of terror, this era belongs to Suede

(Crash) Tell a tubby cos Angelica is tellin a
Cash sarratoga, Fahrenheit is flat, fuck the dyke
End of year for this Kashmir, Suede shit bro
Microwavin yo ass, and meltin in yo mouth, like

On and on and some try to do this
Yes y'all to the Camp lo
On and on and some try to do this
Yes y'all to the Camp lo1Embed
