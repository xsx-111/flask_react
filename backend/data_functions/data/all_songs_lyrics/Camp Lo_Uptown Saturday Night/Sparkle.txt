Sparkle Lyrics

Sparklin'
Lo-a, Lo-a, Lo-a, Lo-a

Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a) (Sparklin')
Bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a) (Sparklin')

Diamond runners
Strangers in paradise, hobo flats
Sugar cane alley-scats
Lo in parade
With the Black Spades, Courvoisier
Spillin' on the rocks
Intoxicating the satin dolls
With his private dance
And it don't stop 'til the midnight
This glass got me right
Only live Lo light
Then drown in the Moët Dom
On to the disco
Sisqo got me laced
Scorch a half a quart
Then E&J get chased
Bronx vigilantes, call us big wheelers
Diamond crook avengers, sheeba doll stealers

Give me sunshine dada
A twenty-one convincer salute
For the Africana
Midnight Express, how we do
Hold my razors, beaucoup
Jiggas and figures of coolie facin' shadow boxers
Undercover faggot lovers
Dig my Satin Struthers
Coolie High way up in the sky
Throw in the fly
Car wash bubble out
In a grand stand land
Goldie everyday
Stick the slick in the style
Stick ya self, stick ya self
Swap out
Every district
Bring the mischief
Sing the Sweetback
Blaze the skama, drop the rag, push the seat back
Diamanté catch reflect off the chrome rim
Private stock drenched me, I can't stop from bubblin'
Alley cat anthem
Always bless the istol
Jungle Brown and C-Smoke
Complete the Lo official

Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a) (Sparklin')
Bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a) (Sparklin')

Welcome to Chardonnay heaven
It's the seven layers of pleasure
My genuine draft with the Lo-a accurate measures
Precision on beats if your Camp is wanted wherever
I'm bringin' the rain
Clappin' rhythms to stormy weathers
Bruh, kissin' to Quiet Fire
Higher will get us lower
Starfish and Coffee diggin'
Riggin' in shattered lifers
We only jive talkin'
Razor keep cotton squawkin'
Blazin' the loose cannons
On top of white diamond sands
Street corner symphonies spillin'
Course there's a lower twistin'
Brown Hornet keepin' it nappy
Keeps on keepin' on

Curious shades of black
Gleamin' off the roof of the 'ac
Don't know how to act
Wildin' with the nonchalant pack
Slappin' the theives
With the unbelieves
That'd be shakin' your block
With the six million dollar bot
Just stop the bloodclot tears
For years, we airtight
Another flight
Until the Fahrenheit, Harlem night
I'm shankin' your thoughts, keepin' the Lo blade sharp for life
It's a jungle masquerade and we forever stone trife

Now check out the con comin' from the island of ice
No contact with shiest bubblin' with Mr. Midnight
And talkin' the jive
Flirtacious with cases of slick
And shovelin' herb
Hip-tone from Black Belt Jones
That Ebony junction
That be the function
Yo, dig it
Time to shake a leg, get up in the wind suga

Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a) (Sparklin')
Bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a)
Got the bubbly (Lo-a)
Pourin' through me (Lo-a) (Sparklin')

It's the Lo-a
Pourin' through me
It's the Lo-a
Go ahead (Geechi Suede)
It's the Lo-a
Got the bubbly (Sparklin')
It's the Lo-a
With the Cheeba (Cheeba)
Get the drizzy on
Get the drizzy on (How we do it )
Get the drizzy on
It's the Lo-a (Sparklin')
Courvoisier, Alizé, uh
Yeah, get your drizzy on
How we flow, team
Get the drizzy on
Float the Tri-state
Get the drizzy on (Sparklin')
