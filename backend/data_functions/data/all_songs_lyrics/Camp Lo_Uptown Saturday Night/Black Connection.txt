Black Connection Lyrics
Peep the story
Sonny Cheeba, Geechi Suede
Check it out
Volume 1 of this joint

I ski in Switzerland
Down in Morocco gambling, handling
B.I. for my crooks back in the BX
Sex, collect wines
Italian designs
Quicksilver could paint the canvas if needed
But should it be not
Cause everything goes according to plan

Yo killing 'em softly
Making 'em cop plea
Blessing the black leaf
Sticking with forty thieves
Now diggy bruh
Time to conjugate on my delegates
Shikaka, all of bo daggin', from the tri-borough
In they dime, lita named sunshine
The Lola Falanas diggy now
Rocking his pocket flo the mass that
Hackensack, highway to holly for this cashmere
Satin pro, got the somali, rolls on my mind
In France I dance by the moon
Sailing from Cancun, steaming vega's lace
Limping with some delegates that put me on
Capridi scarf around my neck, little red corvette
We got some merchandise to heist
Up in canada we move

(Right, right, right)

Calling up the diamond delegates
Black connection
For the Sonny Cheeba and the Suede
Black connection
Got the Bronx, Brooklyn, and the Harlem
Black connection
All the triborough got the back of black connection

She scored me up
Told me rolls is dying
Wired Geechi Suede
Need right hand for this caravan
To relieve the bread
Harlem, Brook, BX
Catch the character that snatched the goods
Huggy bear
Put me on to the will on it hit the gas
I got the wire
Ignored it, then poured it real slow in Tekida's glass
Her radiance, radiance smiling, diamonds, Giorgio splash
The suede is arousing
Caressing Caribbean gems
The squeezing of jizza is stimulating
Now on my bend
Lent symphonies, left a crystal rock I copped at Tiffany's
She sniffed heron, let her hair down and paced the balcony
I scraped the well
That'll have her on the score for years
But backed to the hawk
Who pulling shiest maneuvers on my camp, yeah

I don't understand, what the fuck is up with my man
Eat a bowl of hot cock, now Sonny Cheeba, Volume one
Catch the mighty bullion cat, comin' out the go-go bar
Harvey's over top, mop 'em up, juke his monkey ass

Calling up the diamond delegates
Black connection
For the Sonny Cheeba and the Suede
Black connection
Got the Bronx, Brooklyn, and the Harlem
Black connection
All the triborough got the back of black connection
My Huggy Bear connect, connect
Me cautious, I enter a flaming scorch
You by the door
Moolah all over the floor
Time to gather as much as I can
Tryin' not to get blam, my fam is vicious
Get message to Cheeba, in need of assistance right now

Then I get the rumble on the hip
I hear the fuzz, gotta split
Give my peeps a once over
Suede in town, bridge bound
See the shiesty eyes, filled in double o
This is it, through the corridor
Hit the floor, time y'all pack it up
What y'all laughin' at
Loose cannons, blaze my hathaway
Shake a leg, into the hallway, vision Geechi Suede
Coolie high cats
Back to back, 'bout to see the gates
Twist of fate, ease up into the room, let the guns play

Yeah, avoid the penal
In jeopardy with no ammo to flow
But me and my Ace is goin' out with less than zero, oh no
Now here come the crooks
Paradin' by storm with the Lugars and oar
We conquered ground as usual
Lo empire can never fall
Yeah

Calling up the diamond delegates
Black connection
For the Sonny Cheeba and the Suede
Black connection
Got the Bronx, Brooklyn, and the Harlem
Black connection
All the triborough got the back of black connection

Brother Joe Chi be a part of
Black connection
Sonny Cheeba be a part of
Black connection
Cat Fabu be a part of
Black connection
Man Suede always be a part of
Black connection
And we ride on3Embed
