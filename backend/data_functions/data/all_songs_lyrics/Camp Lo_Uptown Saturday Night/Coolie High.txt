Coolie High Lyrics
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High got you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High keeps you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High got you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow

Yo, Jah, it’s raining Alizé
I’m floating through the Holland Tunnel, swerving
I’m digging on a Sheba—pulling cheeba, she be splurging
We’re lurking with the chrome ‘cause we be murkin' from the Boogie
And shitting on them crabs ‘cause they’re jive, fake, and woolly
No doubt

Yeah
Trade shots of life—for all night, you’ll dig it
Kept it hotter, Kenyatta to Big Dipper, get hipper
(Coolie High got you wide)
Spilling coffee inside my automo Eldo’
Cracking satin on leather.  What’s happening?  Bullet convincer
Cash straight out of comic books, catching a flurry
Keep your eye on the Lo or miss the heaven and glory
Cats be coming with hammers and dramas
With the buddhas and Rugers inside Cruisers and Rovers
Diamond crooks taking it over with
Razors and cutters with the sugar and butters
Pimping Caesars in leathers, we live for Coolie High treasures and pleasures

Check the queen bee, Lady Ree digging Grace
Check the place 3 o’clock.  Shot?  No we ain’t
Fret and cock, bring it in the paint?  No such thing
Flash the dynamite, sing my superfly to the
Cleopatra in the casino with gold sugar
Dig my harlequin and drench you in my Donald Goines

From borough to borough in the Montero, sliding it thorough
With bottles of Asti Spumante to tranquilize my heaven
Count seven, we’re getting spliffs and shooting sugar to the shorties
Luchini to spare, let me see your istols in the air
Word life

You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High got you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High keeps you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High got you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
Lo keeps the party live
The 80 proof is leaking, got me screeching—Jersey
Drive
We’re screaming ‘cause we’re villains and our caliber is “bring it.”
I’m laying in the purple rain until I see some action
We’re moving motionless, continuous, and that’s what’s happenin'

Got the bubbly pouring through me in Cleopatra’s casino
Sweep back in Coolie High, jacking jitterbugs and little sunshine
Dolemites outta sight, anti-hottest cats in the city
On the money, taking the Tri-State under saucy vine
Billy Holidaying the Foxy Browns with my Harlequins
The penny, he repelling.  Reflecting crystals, it’s Hollywood

The pulling stars ‘cause we’re licking Cuban cigars and sipping Moe
Playing the jigga cotton, the figures on the low-and-low
Blessing the dimes, keeping my Campers on the higher flow
Living the crimes, hitting them sly for the c-notes

Yo, Prince of the city pouring right on the JJ’s and Sauté
Cab Callowaying the last of the finest, shot Cyrus
Crisis is coming lower with jiggas less than zero, that
Sex the Lo, dice the Lo.  I’ll tell you what:
On the night-vision decision underneath the silver moon
Boys from Company C, a day sugar love
Your boy Chief be for Stoning, Robbing.  ‘Chero be for midnight
The safety's off the toaster and my shadow's by the moonlight
‘Cause Native’s on the levels and the Lo is on the EQ
My stamina is sugar and it’s love, love forever, y’all

You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High got you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High keeps you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
(Coolie High got you wide)
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
