The Kettle LyricsWhy the kettle dry?
Why the empty eye?
Why the vacant sky?
Why the sunspots cry?
The kettle dry
The sunspots cry
The empty eye
The vacant sky
And you ask me
Why the kettle dry?
Why?
Well, you ain't gonna like it
Well, you ain't gonna like it, darling
If you want you can buy it
But it won't wait, darling
You say you want to understand
You say you won't be underhand
Why the kettle dry?
Why?
Why the scarecrow cry?
Why the rainbow fly?
Why the planets die?
Why the kettle dry?
The scarecrow cry with an empty eye
The rainbow fly in the vacant sky
The planets die and the sunspots cry
The kettle dry and you ask me
Why the kettle dry?
Why?
Well, you ain't gonna like it
It's no use tryin' to fight it, darling
It's so bad I can't stand it
I'm moving out, darling
It's time you came to understand
You never again will hold my hand
Why the kettle dry?
Why?
Why?Embed
