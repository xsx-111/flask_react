The Machine Demands a Sacrifice LyricsWhen the night wind cries on the Bloodred feathers
Containers groan as they come together
And the loaded roadsigns they point to never
Don't let it sleep
Don't let it fall asleep
When seagulls cry from the powered drains
Computers call back from the hearts of cranes
And the Tanks of Tigers prowl through the brains
Don't let it sleep
Don't let it fall asleepEmbed
