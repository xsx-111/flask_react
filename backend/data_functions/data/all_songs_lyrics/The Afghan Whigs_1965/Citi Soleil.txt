Citi Soleil LyricsJean Content
He wake up everyday
In a government yard
Deep down inside Citi Soleil
Roll some bones and catch a fire
Evil minds, they will conspire
The moon to lose its light
The stars sink into night
Across the town
A young girl plays guitar
"Do you remember me?" She sings to a lover
She worships from afar
Roll some bones and catch a fire
Evil minds, they will expire
The moon to shine a light
Upon us all tonight
Ooh child, I'll meet you, child
On the sunny side, it's alright, it's alright
No lies, and no cryin'
It's alright
"How you like me now?"
My friend, he say
"How you like the madness of Citi Soleil?"
Roll the bones and catch a fire
Join the triumph of the choir
Citi Soleil, Citi Soleil
I love to say Citi SoleilEmbed
