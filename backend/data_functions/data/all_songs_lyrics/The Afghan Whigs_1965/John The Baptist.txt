John The Baptist LyricsHey... Welcome home
I got a little wine
Some Marvin Gaye
Come on and taste me
Come on and take me, I'm yours
Dance, little sister, dance
This is my girl you're talkin' to
There isn't anything I wouldn't do
So take me... Taste me... Erase me
I'm yours... Let's get it on
Anything for a lover
Anything for a friend
I only wanna see you happy
Baby can we pretend
I'd give anything to see you dance
I'd give anything to see you smile
But baby doesn't want just anything
She wants everything
Hey... Welcome home
I got a little wine
I got a little time
So come on and take me
Come on and taste me
Come on and waste me
Come on erase me
I'm yours... Let's get it on
I got the devil in me, girlEmbed
