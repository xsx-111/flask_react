The Slide Song LyricsBaby
Don't make me worry aboutcha
You look so sad
What'd ya do, to make ya so blue?
I have to ask ya, where do you go?
You look so faraway sometimes
I don't know, where do you go?
I wanna go
Miles away and miles above
The vampire only wants a little love
You might be right, you might be
Everything that you said that you were
But, so?
Baby
Don't make me worry... Aboutcha
They say that goodbye
Arrives by design
Who do you think about when you're lonely?
I remember when you used to sing
About your one and only
You're such a phony
Now I finally know you really know me
Miles away and miles above
The vampire only wants a little love
A little love, a little more
He's got ya now
You're gone for sureEmbed
