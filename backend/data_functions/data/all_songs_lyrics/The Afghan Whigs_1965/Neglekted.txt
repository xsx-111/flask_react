Neglekted LyricsI knew a girl, extraordinary
Suggested something, unsanitary
As I asked her for a moment
To consider her kind offer
She blew a kiss and said to me...
I know you know
You want it so
I want it too, so see it through
'Cuz when I do what I'm gonna do to you
Make sure you remember my name
You know it's true
I want it too
I know you know, so make it so
'Cuz when I do what I'm gonna do to you
You'll never ever, ever...
Intoxicated, by your aggression
I offer you my one possession
You can fuck my body, baby
But pleeze, don't fuck my mind
Get you high, girl, come with me
Take a ride in search of ecstasy
I wanna roll with ya, I wanna roll
I feel you now, I never knew
You were so sad, i'll make it up to you
'Cuz I feel you now
I feel you now...Embed
