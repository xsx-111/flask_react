66 LyricsYeah
You walked in
Just like smoke
With a little c'mon, c'mon, c'mon in your walk
Come on
I've been waiting
Are you waiting
For my move?
Well, I'm making it
So tell me baby, can you shake it?
If I can move it with you will you let me take it?
I'll be down on my knees screaming
"Take me, take me
Take me, take me
I'm yours"
I've
Never
Felt so
Out of control
You don't even know
What you're doing to me
C'mon and do it to me
Don't you stop
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, little rabbit
Show me where you've got it
'Cos I know you've got a habit
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, little rabbit
Show me where you've got it
'Cos I know you've got a habit
C'mon, c'mon
Show me, little rabbit
Show me where you've got it
'Cos I know you've got a habit
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
C'mon (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
C'mon (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
C'mon (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
C'mon (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
C'mon (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
C'mon (c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, little rabbit
Show me where you've got it
'Cos I know you've got a habit
C'mon, c'mon
C'mon, little rabbit
Show me where you've got it
'Cos I know you've got a habit
Show me where you've got it
'Cos I know you've got a habit
Show me where you've got it
'Cos I know you've got a habit
Show me
Show meEmbed
