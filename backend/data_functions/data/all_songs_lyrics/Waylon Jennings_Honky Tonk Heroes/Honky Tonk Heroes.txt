Honky Tonk Heroes LyricsLow down leavin' sun
I've done did everything that needs done
Woe is me, why can't i see
I'd best be leavin' well enough alone
Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights
Keep a-hauntin' me in memories
Well, there's one in every crowd, for cryin' out loud
Why was it always turnin' out to be me

Where does it go, the good Lord only knows
It seems like it was just the other day
I was down at Green Gables, a hawkin' them tables
And generally blowin' all my hard earned pay
Piano roll blues, danced holes in my shoes
There weren't another other way to be
For lovable losers, no account boozers
And honky tonk heroes like me
