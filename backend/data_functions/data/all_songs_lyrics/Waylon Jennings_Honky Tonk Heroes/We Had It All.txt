We Had It All Lyrics
I can hear the wind a-blowing in my mind
Just the way it used to sound through the Georgia pines
And you were there to answer when I called
You and me we had it all

Remember how I used to touch your hair
While reaching for the feeling that was always there
You were the best thing in my life that I recall
You and me we had it all

I know that we can never live those times again
So I let my dreams take me back to where we've been
Then I'll stay with you girl as long as I can
Oh, it was so good, oh, so good
Mmm, when I was your man

I'll never stop believing in your smile
Even though you didn't stay, it was all worth while
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
You and me we had it all
You and me we had it allEmbed
