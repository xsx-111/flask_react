Black Rose Lyrics
Way down in Virginia
Amongst the tall grown sugar canes
Lived a simple man and a dominicker hen
And a rose of a different name
Well, the first time I felt lightning
I was standing in the drizzling rain
With a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
And a rose of a different name

Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone

When the devil made that woman
Lord, he threw the pattern away
She was built for speed
With the tools you need
To make a new fool every day
Way down deep and dirty
On the darker side of shame
I caught a cane cuttin' man and a bottle of gin
With a rose of a different name
Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
And help me leave that black rose alone
Well, the devil made me do it the first time
The second time I done it on my own
Lord, put a handle on a simple-headed man
And help me leave that black rose aloneEmbed
