Low Down Freedom Lyrics
Long haired young girl here beside me
Fit my body, warm my mind
Sleeping quiet never knowin'
By tomorrow she'll be one more thing
I'm gonna leave behind
Like them big wheels I'll be rollin'
Like them rivers gonna flow to sea
'Cause I'd rather leave here knowin'
That I'd made the fool of love
Before it made the fool of me

Low down freedom, you done cost me
Everything I'll ever lose Lord
You're as empty as my pockets
From the top of where you start
Down to the bottom of my shoes

Open highway, lonesome wind blows
Tell me something I don't know
Wrapped in woman arms around me
Tell me why I'm gonna leave
And I don't really wanna go
