Ride Me Down Easy Lyrics
The highway she's hotter than nine kinds of hell
The rides, they're as scarce as the rain
When you're down to your last shuck with nothing to sell
And too far away from the trains
Been a good month of Sundays and a guitar ago
Had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left a long string of friends, some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind

Ride me down easy Lord, ride me on down
Leave word in the dust where I lay
Say I'm easy come, easy go
And easy to love when I stay

Put snow on the mountain, raise hell on the hill
Locked horns with the devil himself
Been a rodeo bum, a son of a gun
And a hobo with stars in his crown
