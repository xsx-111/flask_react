Willy The Wandering Gypsy And Me Lyrics
Three fingers whiskey pleasures the drinkers
And moving does more than the same thing for me
Willy he tells me that doers and thinkers
Say moving is the closest thing to being free
Well he's rosined his riggings and laid back his wages
He's dead set on ridin' the big rodeo
My woman's tight with an overdue baby
And Willy keeps yelling, "Hey, Gypsy, let's go"

Willy, you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther
Ready rolled from the same makings as me
Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble 'til Hell freezes over
Willy the wandering Gypsy and me

Now, ladies, we surely will take of your favors
And we'll surely warn you there never will be
A single soul living that could put brand or handle
On Willy the wandering Gypsy and me
We'll dance on the mountains, shout in the canyons
And swarm in a loose herd like wild buffalo
Jammin' our heads full of figures and angles
And tellin' us stuff that we already know
Willy, you're wild as a Blue Texas Norther
Ready rolled from the same makings as me
Well, I reckon we're gonna ramble 'til Hell freezes over
Willy the wandering Gypsy and me

Hey, Willy, you're wild as a Texas Blue Norther
Ready rolled from the same makings as me
And I reckon we're gonna ramble 'til Hell freezes over
Willy the wandering Gypsy and meEmbed
