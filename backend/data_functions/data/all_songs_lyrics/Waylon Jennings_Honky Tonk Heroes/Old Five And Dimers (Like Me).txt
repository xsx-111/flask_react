Old Five And Dimers (Like Me) LyricsI've spent the lifetime making up my mind to be
More than the measure of what I thought others could see
Good luck and fast bucks are too far and too few between
Cadillac buyers and old five and dimers like me
She stood beside me letting me know she would be
Something to lean on when everything ran out on me
Fenced yards ain't hole cards and like as not never will be
Reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me
It's taken me so long and now that I know I believe
All that I do or say is all I ever will be
Too far and too high and too deep ain't too much to be
Too much ain't enough for old five and dimers like me
An old five and dimer is all I intended to beEmbed
