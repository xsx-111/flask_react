Waiting for an Alibi LyricsValentino's got a bookie shop
And what he takes he gives for what he's got
And what he's got he says he has not
Stole from anyone
It's not that he don't tell the truth
Or even that he misspent his youth
It's just that he holds the proof
But you know something's wrong
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
Valentino's in a cold sweat
Placed all his money on that last bet
Against all the odds, he smokes another cigarette
Says that it helps him to forget he's a nervous wreck
It's not that he misses much
Or even that he's lost his lucky touch
It's just that he gambles so much
And you know that it's wrong
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting just to catch your eye
Waiting for an alibi
Tried to say I told you, I told you
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting just to get you
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
To say I told you
Waiting for an alibi
Waiting for an alibi
Oh my, my, my,  my, my, my,  my
My, my, my,  my, my, my, my, my1Embed
