Got to Give It Up Lyrics
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
That stuff
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
That stuff

Tell my mama and tell my pa
That their fine young son didn't get far
He made it to the end of a bottle
Sitting in a sleazy bar
He tried hard but his spirit broke
He tried until he nearly choked
In the end he lost his bottle drinking alcohol

I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
That stuff
I've got to give it up
I've got to give it up
That stuff
Tell my brother I tried to write and
Put pen to paper but I was frightened
I couldn't seem to get the words out right
Right quite right
Tell my sister I'm sinking slow
Now and again I powder my nose
In the end I lost my bottle
It smashed in a casbah

I've been messing with the heavy stuff
For a time I couldn't get enough
But I'm waking up and it's wearing off
Junk don't take you far
Tell my Mama I'm coming home
And in my youth I'm getting old
And I think it's lost control
Mama I'm coming home
