Sarah LyricsWhen you came in my life
You changed my world
My Sarah
Everything seemed so right
My baby girl
My Sarah
You are all I want to know
You hold my heart so don't let go
You are all I need to live
My love to you I'll give
My Sarah
When you begin to smile
You change my style
My Sarah
When I look in your eyes
I see my prize
My Sarah
You are all I want to know
You hold my heart so don't let go
You are all I need to live
My love to you I'll give
You are all I want to know
Oh my Sarah
Don't let go, oh no
My Sarah
You are all I want to know
You hold my heart so don't let go
You are all I need to live
My love to you I'll always give
You are all I want to know
You hold my heart so don't let go
You are all I want to know
Oh my Sarah
Yes, you changed my style
With your baby smile
Sarah
Childlike charms keep me warm
Hold you in my arms
Sarah
Change my world
My baby girl
Sarah
All I want to know
Don't let go
No, no, no, no, no, no
Sarah
Sarah
Be mineEmbed
