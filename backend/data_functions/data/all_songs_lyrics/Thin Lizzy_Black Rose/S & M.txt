S & M Lyrics
She walked out of a shady motel
Into the arms of a sugar daddy
She'd been havin' a good time
Oh, but she loved her daddy madly
She said, "Daddy, what can I do?
I want to spend my time makin' love to you"
But her daddy had to run, hit and run
Now he's gone

(Ooh) S&M (Ooh)

This customer was shady
He kept a rubber hose
He liked to beat the ladies
There's nothin' wrong with that I suppose
"Yes, there is"
He made them want to shout, "Ouch!"
But this time you better watch out
He kicked her
Oh, and he beat her and he whipped her

(Ooh) S&M (Ooh)
(Ooh) He beat her black and blue (Ooh)
He just liked the violence
Said it made him tough
Now he just liked the violence
She couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough

(Ooh) S&M (Ooh)
(Ooh) He beat her like a drum (Ooh)

This fetish could be foolish
It could lead to something dangerously reckless
To hold your lover helpless
Could lead to something called a mess
You like to be tacky and kinky
Sleazy and slinky
To make them want to shout, "Ouch!"
Fight back and scratch out

(Ooh) S&M (Ooh)
(Ooh) Do it again (Ooh)1Embed
