Toughest Street in Town LyricsOutside the window the neon flashes
In the morning light
Down on the sidewalk there's a woman with a problem
But she don't know how to fight
She's destitute and broken down
She softly whispers, is there no one around
And no one hears the sound
Her knees give way and hit the ground
This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest street around
This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest
Like a rat in a pack it attacks
From the back
Through a crack in a track
And you take a smack
And Jack has had a hard day
No one told him it would be like this
He's had to score the hard way
And there's that trick he'll always miss
This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest, it's tough stuff
This is the toughest street around
This is the toughest, don't you do down there
It's just another black spot
Where far too many people have died
It's just another graveyard
And there's not too many people left alive
This is the toughest, are you tough enough?
This is the toughest, are you rough enough?
This is the toughest, can you bluff enough?
Just a minor misery did me no harm
But it's there as a constant reminder and it's there to warn
Outside the window the neon is still flashing
In the morning light
Down on the sidewalk that woman was blown away
Out of sight
All across the city no one gives a damn
All across the city no one seems to understand
This is the toughest
This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest street around
This is the toughest, are you rough enough?
This is the toughest, if I were you I wouldn't come around here
This is the toughest, this is the toughest street
This is the toughest, are you tough enough?
This is the toughest, don't you go down there
This is the toughest, come here, Jack, you want to see some pictures?
This is the toughest
This is the toughest street in town
This is the toughest street around
This is the toughest, and the beat goes down
This is the toughestEmbed
