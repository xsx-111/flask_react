Do Anything You Want To LyricsThere are people that will investigate you
They'll insinuate, intimidate and complicate you
Don't ever wait or hesitate to
State the fate that awaits those who
Try to shake or take you
Don't let them break you
You can do anything you want to do
It's not wrong what I'm saying, it's true
You can do anything you want to do
Do what you want to
People that despise you
Will analyze then criticize you
They'll scandalize and tell lies until they realize you
Are somebody they should've apologized to
Don't let these people compromise you
Be wise too
You can do anything you want to do
It's not wrong what I'm saying, it's true
You can do anything you want to do
Do what you want to
Hey you
You're not their puppet on a string
You can do everything
It's true
If you really want to
You can do anything you want
Just like I do
You can do anything you want to do
It's not wrong what I'm saying, it's true
You can do anything you want to do
Do what you want to
Hey you
You can do
Hey you
Yes, you
Elvis is dead
The king of rock and roll is dead
Elvis is deadEmbed
