With Love LyricsIt's a tedious existence, laying your love on the line
Resistance is useless, she can leave at any time
I must confess that in my quest, I felt depressed and restless
But this casanova's roving days are over more or less
With love
With love
She's broke my heart and made me sad
She's broke my heart and made me sad
She's broke my heart, you foolish boy you lost what you had
With love
She says she won't be back no more
With love
Oh, she says goodbye
My mademoiselle, I must make my farewell
You see, se√±or, I know she don't want me no more
I'd like to make that Fraulein mine, mein Fraulein
So I'll depart, my sweetheart, and leave you with this line
With love
She says she won't be back no more
With love
She says she's leaving for sure
My mademoiselle, I'll say farewell
No matter where you are, au revoir
Till we meet again, auf Wiedersehn
She wrote it on a letter, but it didn't make him feel any better
With love, with love
She says goodbye, adios, farewell1Embed
