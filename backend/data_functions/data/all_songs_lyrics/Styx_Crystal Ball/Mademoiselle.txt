Mademoiselle LyricsJe t'aime Mademoiselle, ooh la la
Tell me where are you going
Sweet Mademoiselle
To London or Paris
To the Grand Hotel
Where do you go
At the end of the day
Where do you go
When you spend time away
To islands in the tropic sands
Or pleasure trips to distant lands
You're searching for a dream
Well, maybe it's me
I tell you hello
And what do you say
As I stop you go
There's no reason to stay
It all began so harmlessly
You gave me love so easily
I never realized
You were just spending time
Tell me where are you going
Sweet Mademoiselle
To London or Paris
To the Grand Hotel
Even though you're far away
I think about you every day
And wonder if you're thinking of me
In a fond memory, oh
Sweet Mademoiselle
Sweet Mademoiselle
Sweet Mademoiselle
Sweet Mademoiselle
Tell me where are you going
Sweet Mademoiselle
To London or Paris
Ou Montreal
Sweet Mademoiselle
Sweet Mademoiselle
Sweet Mademoiselle
