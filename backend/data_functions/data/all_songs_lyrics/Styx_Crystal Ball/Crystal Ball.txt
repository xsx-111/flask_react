Crystal Ball Lyrics
I used to like to walk the straight and narrow line
I used to think that everything was fine
Sometimes I'd sit and gaze for days
Through sleepless dreams
All alone and trapped in time
All alone and trapped in time

I wonder what tomorrow has in mind for me
Or am I even in it's mind at all
Perhaps, I'll get a chance
To look ahead and see
Soon as I find myself a crystal ball
Soon as I find myself a crystal ball

Well, tell me, tell me where I'm going
I don't know where I've been
Tell me, tell me, won't you tell me
And then tell me again
My heart is breaking, my body's aching
And I don't know where to go
So tell me, tell me, won't you tell me
I've just gotta know
Crystal ball
There's so many things I need to know
Crystal ball
There's so many things I've gotta know
Crystal ball
Won't you tell me please before I go
Crystal ball

Oh, tell me, tell me where I'm going
I don't know where I've been
Tell me, tell me, won't you tell me
And then tell me again
My heart is breaking, my body's aching
And I don't know where to go
So tell me, tell me, won't you tell me
I've just gotta know

Crystal ball
Oh, there's so many things I need to know
Crystal ball
There's so many things I've gotta know
Crystal ball
Won't you tell me please before I go
