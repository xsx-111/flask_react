Jennifer LyricsJennifer
She drinks her sherry wine
She keeps her lady's love for me all the time
She's seventeen
Barely old enough to cry
A child in her father's eyes, a woman every night
Her love
Gives me the power
Her dreams carry me on
Jennifer, so inviting
That I sing
Jennifer
She took me by surprise
She told me that she's much too young to keep me satisfied
Jennifer
Ah so delicate and shy
A child in her mother's eyes but a woman every night
Her love
Gives me the power
Her dreams carry me on
Jennifer, so exciting
That I sing
Her love
Gives me the power
Her dreams carry me on
Jennifer, so exciting
That I singEmbed
