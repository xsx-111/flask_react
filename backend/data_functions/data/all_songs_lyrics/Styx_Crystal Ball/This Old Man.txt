This Old Man LyricsThis old man, he worked for thirty years with two strong hands
In the factory light his lunch box held all his needs
With coffee, sandwiches and dreams for me
This old man, he taught me many times to understand
That showing love is simply nothing you should have to hide
"Don't keep your feelings locked inside", he said
When I was young, I dreamed a young man's dreams
I saw in your eyes the things I'd never seen
But now I grow old but I don't really mind
'Cause can't you see with my family we'll share these timeless memories
When I was young, I dreamed a young man's dreams
I saw in your eyes the things I'd never seen
But now I grow old but I don't really mind
'Cause can't you see with my family we'll share these timeless memoriesEmbed
