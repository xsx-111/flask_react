Shooz LyricsWell it's Friday nite and the streets
Are full of the weekenders with their green
Soldier boys looking left and right
At all the sights there to be seen
Well you can bet there's a loner
Who'd love to see you be so sweet
That's why I'm telling you to get on your shooz
And get out there on the street
And get your rockin', get your rockin', roll
Rock 'n' roll shooz
Up and down around they go
With their heads turning all around
Way down there on the corner
There's a Cadillac that's easy to be found
Way down there in Chicago
Down along Division Street
The boys are just looking for a girl
Like you to make their stay in town a treat
So get your rockin', get your rockin', roll
Rock 'n' roll shooz
Get it there and you set up new rules
Watch out
I'm told with the armor that he comes more
Here he comes
So get your rockin', oh rockin' roll
Rock 'n' roll shooz
Say another, say it again
Rock 'n' roll shooz
Now they all love it and they keep comin' back for more
Rock 'n' roll shoozEmbed
