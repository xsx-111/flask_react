Group Transport Hall Lyrics
Grey balloons
Set towards the sun
Fighting words
Underneath your tongue

Soon we will be laughing
Out there on the landing
Now it's too bright (Now it's too bright)
Dancing through the ash (Dancing through the ash)
You made other plans (You made other plans)

Soon we'll start
To pick up on the feuds
In the dark
There's a narrow flame

Soon we will be laughing
Out there on the landing
Now it's too bright (Now it's too bright)
Dancing through the ash (Dancing through the ash)
You made other plans (You made other plans)Embed
