Shaking Hand Lyrics
I saw it
Hit the ground
But no one
Was around

Carrying the dummy and always the same as you
Same as you
Ancient wallpaper, I can walk and talk and sing straight out
As you
As you

There were ticking bloody watches in our hands
Poured into the soil we written letters
Have another heart attack and folding up our chairs
Open up your mouth, where you want to go?

I can hardly recognize the shapes
The shapes
Wandering through Chinatown, white strands under artificial heat
Artificial heat
Slip down the middle with some small teeth
