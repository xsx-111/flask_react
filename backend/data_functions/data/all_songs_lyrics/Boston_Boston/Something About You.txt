Something About You LyricsWhen I was younger I thought I could stand on my own
It wasn't easy, I stood like a man made of stone

But there was something about you
I really want you to know
It brought a change over me
It's startin' to show
I've got this feelin' inside
Gotta have ya, have ya, ain't no good to hide
It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I know, when you believe in a man like me
When I get angry I say things I don't want to say
I really mean it, I don't want to leave you this way
I couldn't help my reaction
I really want you to know
I lose control over you
I just want you to know
Got this feeling inside
Gotta have ya, have ya, ain't no good to hide
It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I know, when you believe in a man like me


It isn't easy
To show what I'm feeling inside, girl
It isn't easy
I know, to believe in a man like me
Like me, can't you see
I got to, got to have you

But there was something about you
Yeah there was something about you3Embed
