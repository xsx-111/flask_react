Foreplay/Long Time Lyrics


It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me
It keeps on rollin'

Sail on, on a distant highway, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' a dream
I've gotta be on my way
Wish there was something I could say

Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
And I take what I find, I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door

Ah yeah yeah yeah
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time
Hey
Well I get so lonely
When I am without you-ooo
But in my mind, deep in my mind
I can't forget about you, ohh

Now good times
And faces that remind me, yeah
I'm tryin' to forget your name
And leave it all behind me
You're comin' back to find me

Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
You'll forget about me after I've been gone
And I take what I find, I don't want no more
It's just outside of your front door

Yeah yeah yeah, hey
It's been such a long time
It's been such a long time

Yeah, It's been such a long time
I think I should be goin', yeah
And time doesn't wait for me
It keeps on rollin'

There's a long road
I've gotta stay in time with, yeah
I've got to keep on chasin' that dream
Though I may never find it
I'm always just behind it, oo ooo

Well, I'm takin' my time, I'm just movin' along
Takin' my time, oh, just movin' along
Takin' my time, ohh, I'm takin' my time
Takin' my time, yeah
Takin' my time
Takin' my time
Takin' my time (takin' my time)
Takin' my time (oh just takin' my time)
Takin' my time (just outside-a your front door)
Takin' my time5Embed
