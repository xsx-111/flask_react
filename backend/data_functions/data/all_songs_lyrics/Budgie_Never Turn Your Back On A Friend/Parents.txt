Parents LyricsWhen I was a little boy
They would say to me
Don't go in the world and play
It's bad company
All they had was child and faith
Let him grow and let him wait
Just to find out what it was to be free
But now I'm over twenty one
Growing up I've had my fun
And I know it's got to be
Baby lying in a womb
Are you free or in a tomb
Let me in
I feel I want to cry
Oh the road is there
Oh the road is there
Come on back, back
Wash your hands and up to bed
Mind your manners
Or you're dead
Mind the cars cos you've got school on Monday
Put my trust in God
Who is he I know not what
Something mummy said to me one Sunday
Maybe love is life but life is not
Something I need plenty of
Oh! I wish I'd never lived a day
Now there's no one near me now
Tell me what to do and how
Take me let me sing my cares away
Oh! the road is there
Oh that road is there
Come on back, back
Wash your hands and up to bed
Mind your manners
Or you're dead
Mind the cars cos you've got school on Monday
Black is black and white is white
Which to choose and which is right
Guide me to a place where I'll stay
Wrap me up and keep me warm
Hide myself far from the storm
Sleep and love will keep my mind at rest
Only now I realise what my parents had to try
Love you all and keep you all my life
Oh that road is there
Oh the road is there
Come on back, backEmbed
