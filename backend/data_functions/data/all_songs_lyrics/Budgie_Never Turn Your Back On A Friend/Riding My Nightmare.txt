Riding My Nightmare LyricsTake the words I from my praying
And make me feel at home
Not to feel alone
And every time I look behind
I keep on thinking black
There ain't no looking back
Riding my nightmare
Riding my nightmare
Riding my nightmare
And it won't be long
You will find me there
Hold the word I from that way
And wipe my sweat away
You know it hurted bay
Is your mind with better choice
And then in time to come
Think I'm me as one
Riding my nightmare
Riding my nightmare
Riding my nightmare
And it won't be long
You will find me thereEmbed
