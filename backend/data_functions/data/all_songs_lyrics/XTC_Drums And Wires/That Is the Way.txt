That Is the Way Lyrics
(Do this, do that, do this, do that)

Go and speak
(Do this)
To your niece
(Do that)
Kiss your aunt
(Do this)
On the cheek
(Do that)
Don't talk back
(Do this)
Now run along
(Do that)
It's gone eight
(Do this)
Say goodnight
(Do that)

That is the way that it's done
That is the way that it's done
That is the way that it's done
Boy and girl, girl and boy
This is how you do it
And who am I to reason why?
(Do this, do that, do this, do that)

Wear a shirt
(Do this)
Wear a tie
(Do that)
You look smart
(Do this)
In a suit
(Do that)
Use your fork
(Do this)
On the left
(Do that)
Straighten up
(Do this)
Shoulders back
(Do that)

That is the way that it's done
That is the way that it's done
That is the way that it's done
Boy and girl, girl and boy
This is how you do it
And who am I to reason why?
