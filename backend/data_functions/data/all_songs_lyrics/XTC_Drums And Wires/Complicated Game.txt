Complicated Game LyricsI ask myself, "Should I put my finger to the left?" No
I ask myself, "Should I put my finger to the right?" No
It doesn't really matter where I put my finger
Someone else will come along and move it
And it's always been the same
It's just a complicated game
It's just a complicated game
A little girl asked me, should she part her hair up on the left? No
A little girl asked me, should she part her hair up on the right? No
I said, "It really doesn't matter where you part your hair
Someone else will come along and move it
And it's always been the same
It's just a complicated game
It's just a complicated game."
A little boy asked me, should he put his vote upon the Left?
A little boy asked me, should he put his vote upon the Right?
I said, "It really doesn't matter where you put your vote
'Cause someone else will come along and move it
And it's always been the same
It's just a complicated game
It's just a complicated game."
They wanted Tom, they wanted Joe
To dress 'em up and stick 'em out on show
They were holding arrows in a very bad aim
It's just a complicated game
God asked me, should he ought to put his world up on the left? No
God asked me, should he ought to put his world up on the right?
I said, "It doesn't really matter where you put your world
Someone will come along and move it
And it's always been the same
It's just a complicated game
It's just a complicated game
It's just a complicated game
Just a complicated game."3Embed
