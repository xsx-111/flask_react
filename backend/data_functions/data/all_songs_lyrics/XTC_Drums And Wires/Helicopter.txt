Helicopter Lyrics
Oh, heli!
Oh, heli!

I'm crouching here with a telescope in hand
Looking out across our Legoland
I really think it's about time that she came down
She a laughing, giggly whirlybird
She got to be obscene to be ob-heard
I really think it's about time that she came down

And I object to all the air male that she pick up
The air male that she pick up
The air male that she pick up
Oh!

When she's up there twirling 'round
Just like a helicopter, 'copter
She's landing on the town
It's about time that I stopped her, stopped her
When she's up there twirling 'round, 'round, 'round
Just like a helicopter, 'copter
Oh, heli!
Oh, heli!

Now she's away from convent, she's gone wild
She's grown from a nice young lady to a child
I really think it's about time that she came down
She's a laughing, giggly whirlybird
She got to be obscene to be ob-heard
I really think it's about time that she came down

And I object to all the air male that she pick up
The air male that she pick up
The air male that she pick up
Oh!

When she's up there twirling 'round
Just like a helicopter, 'copter
She's landing on the town
It's about time that I stopped her, stopped her
When she's up there twirling 'round, 'round, 'round
Just like a helicopter, 'copter
Oh, heli!
Oh, heli!


Oh, heli!
Oh, heli!

When she's up there twirling 'round
Just like a helicopter, 'copter
She's landing on the town
It's about time that I stopped her, stopped her
When she's up there twirling 'round, 'round, 'round
Just like a helicopter, 'copter

Oh, heli!
Oh, heli!
Oh, heli!

When she's up there twirling 'round...
Like a helicopter, 'copter
She's landing on the town â€” look out, town!
It's about time that I stopped her, stopped her
When she's up there twisting 'round, 'round, 'round...
Oh, heli!
Oh, heli!Embed
