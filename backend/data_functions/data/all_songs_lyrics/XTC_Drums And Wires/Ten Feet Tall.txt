Ten Feet Tall Lyrics
"Now, why stop there?"

Happy I'm floating
Around on my feet now
You make me go dizzy
I'm weak at the knees

Yes, I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall

Well, you say I'm faking
And I say, "Don't worry."
The way that I bubble
There's something in the make

Yes, I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall
Right, the chemistry is right
This boy has reached his height
This feeling just goes on and on, and on, and on
From strength to strength, I'm ten feet long

Yeah, I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall
But I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall

Right, the chemistry is right
This boy has reached his height
This feeling just goes on and on, and on, and on
From strength to strength, I'm ten feet long

Yeah, happy I'm floating
Around on my feet now
You make me go dizzy
I'm weak at the knees
Yes, I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall
I feel like I'm walking
'Round a ten feet tall...Embed
