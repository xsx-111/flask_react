Roads Girdle the Globe Lyrics
Am I asleep or am I fast?
Your every race
You're first, you're last

Roads girdle the globe
We're safe in your concrete robe
Hail mother motor!
Hail piston rotor!
Hail wheel!
Roads girdle the globe
Oh, oh oh, oh oh!
Oh, oh oh, oh oh!

Am I tied in or do I turn?
Your holy incense
Your tire burn

Roads girdle the globe
We're safe in your concrete robe
Hail mother motor!
Hail piston rotor!
Hail wheel!
Roads girdle the globe
Oh, oh oh, oh oh!
Oh, oh oh, oh oh!

Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna
Steer me, Anna!
Oh, oh oh, oh oh!
Oh, oh oh, oh oh!

Am I get there?
When is A, B?
Your iron, oil and steel
Your sacred three
Roads girdle the globe
We're safe in your concrete robe
Roads girdle the globe
We're safe in your concrete robe
Roads girdle the globe
We're safe in your concrete robe
Roads girdle the globe
We're safe in your concrete robe
Hail mother motor!
Hail piston rotor!
Hail wheel!
Hail mother motor!
Hail piston rotor!
Hail wheel!
Hail mother motor!
Hail piston rotor!
Hail wheel!Embed
