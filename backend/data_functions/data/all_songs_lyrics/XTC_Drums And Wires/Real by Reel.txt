Real by Reel Lyrics
In this secret time of invading on our privacy
Unknowing, we mime
We play for the ministry
They can film you in bed or when you take a bath
They can tape every cry; they can tape every laugh
They can turn you around so you won't know what's...

Real by reel
Busy little bees, recording everything you feel
On real by reel
You're documented down like rats
They're catching up on every squeal
On real by reel by real by, reel by real by reel by

In this hidden time, ignorance may help you to cope
Rehearsing for crime and sex just in government cinema-scope
They can film you at work or when they let you play
They can tape what you think and they can tape what you say
They can blur your I.D. so you won't know what's...

Real by reel
They're busy little bees, recording everything you feel
On real by reel
You're documented down like rats
They're catching up on every squeal
On real by reel by real by, reel by real by reel by
Now I lay me down to sleep
Knowing that your lenses peep
And now, I eat my daily bread
And into the tape spool, I'll be fed

They can film you in bed or when you take a bath
They can tape every cry; they can tape every laugh
They can turn you around so you won't know what's...

Real by reel
They're busy little bees, recording everything you feel
On real by reel
You're documented down like rats
They're catching up on every squeal
On real by reel by real by, reel by real by reel by
Real by reel by real by, reel by real by reel byEmbed
