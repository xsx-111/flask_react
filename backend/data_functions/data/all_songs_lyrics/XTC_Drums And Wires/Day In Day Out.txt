Day In Day Out Lyrics
Clock in my head
Clock on the wall
And the two of them
Don't agree at all

Friday is heaven
Friday is heaven
Day in, day out
Day in

(Day in)
Wish you were here
On the shop floor
(And day out)
And together, we could
Count the dots on the wall

Friday is heaven
Friday is heaven
Day in, day out
Day in
Friday is heaven
Friday is heaven
Day in (day in)
Day out (day out)
Day in (day in)
Day out (day out)
Day in
