Famous Prophets (Stars) LyricsApologies to future mes and yous
But I can't help feeling like we're through
The ripping of the tape hurts my ears
In my years, I've never seen anyone quit quite like you do
Twin bruises on my shins
From where I kicked the back of the seat in
They meant what I went through for you
But now they're fading, now they're gone
(Don’t)
(Don’t)
(Don't spend too much time on it)
(Don’t)
(Don't spend too much time on it)
(Don’t)
These teenage hands will never touch yours again
But I remember you
You had a body
You had hands and arms and legs and et cetera
Did I fail? Did I fall?
(In the morning when I wake up, are you mine?)
Did I waste my time, waste my time on a broken heart?
(Take the trash out like a bad dream, are you gone?)
Or is this the start of the great silence?
(From the old house, the fiercest heart spoke, are you mine?)
Is this the start of every day?
(Christmas tree's dead, you know how time flies, are you gone?)
I'm not gonna end up a nervous wreck
Like the people I know who are nervous wrecks
Though I'm not gonna name names
(Yours was an exception)
Did the sound just stop?
At the end of every day
There'll be nothing left to say
There'll be no backstage pass
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We gotta go back
(We've gotta go back)
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
We've gotta go back
Don't get too impressed
You might lose your breath
Don't predict your death
'Cause I like you the best
Don't you fall apart
You might lose my heart
You know I love your art
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
The ocean washed over your grave
The ocean washed open your grave
So descend into cliché
If you've found your holy grail
(The ocean washed over your grave)
I could fill back in that grave
I could hammer in that nail
(The ocean washed open your grave)
I could give you what you want
I could give you what you deserve
(The ocean washed over your grave)
I could sing another song
I could watch that hammer swerve
(The ocean washed open your grave)
And when the mirror breaks
I wouldn't miss it for the world
(The ocean washed over your grave)
Call it blackstar, call it painstar
The same thing happens when you touch it
(The ocean washed open your grave)
Let me tell you, did they tell you what happens when you touch it? Did they tell you?
(The ocean washed over your grave)
Let me tell you what happens when you touch it, let me tell you, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let-
(The ocean washed open your grave)
Let me
Let me in
So descend into cliché
If the music has forsaken you
Roll the stone over the grave
I never liked that one anyways
Or stare into the face
Of whatever it is that's facing you
And if the levee breaks
You'll find out what it is that's replacing you
And when the mirror breaks
I wouldn't miss it for the world
Call it blackstar, call it painstar
The same thing happens when you touch it
Did they tell you what happens when you touch it?
Did they tell you what happens when you touch it?
Did they tell you...
Did they tell me...
What happened to you?

Love-
I gain nothing - I have love, I gain nothing - I have love...
If I give all I possess to the poor (all I possess to the poor) and give over my body to hardship (over my body to hardship) that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing - I gain nothing
Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast-
Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres-

Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears
When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. At the end of my childhood, I put these ways behind me. For now,​ we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known
And now these two remain:9Embed
