Twin Fantasy (Those Boys)  Lyrics
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to

The show ain’t over
They’ll keep on going
They’ll keep on laughing
And fucking around, round, round, round, round

Off into the distance
Those two brothers
Those two lovers
And their smooth-cocked adventures, tures, tures, tures

I haven't looked at the sun for so long
(I haven't looked at the sun for so long)
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
(I'd forgotten how much it hurt to)
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
(I haven't looked at the sun for so long)
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
(I'd forgotten how much it hurt to)
I haven't been outside, I haven't been outside
I haven't been outside, I haven't been outside

They just want to be one
Walk off into the sun
They’re not kissing
And they’re not fucking
They’re just having fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

I haven't looked at the sun for so long
(I haven't looked at the sun for so long)
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
(I'd forgotten how much it hurt to)
I haven't looked at the sun for so long
(I haven't looked at the sun for so long)
I'd forgotten how much it hurt to
(I'd forgotten how much it hurt to)

They were connected
At the back of the head
They had a conduit
Their minds were the same
They were connected
(We were connected)
At the back of the head
(At the back of the head)
They had a conduit
(We had a conduit)
Their minds were the same
(Their minds were the same)

(I haven't been outside, I haven't been outside
I haven't been outside, I haven't been outside)

This is the end of the song, and it is just a song. This is a version of me and you that can exist outside of everything else, and if it is just a fantasy, then anything can happen from here. The contract is up. The names have been changed. So pour one out, whoever you are. These are only lyrics now

When I come back you'll still be here
When I come back you'll still be here
When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)
When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)
When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)
When I come back you'll still be here
(When you come back I'll still be here)
When I come back you'll still be here
(When I come back you'll still be here)
When I come back you'll still be here
(When I come back you'll still be here)7Embed
