High to Death  LyricsI fell over
I fell onto the ground (Ooh)
I wish I was sober
I can't get up off the ground-round-round-round-round-ound-ound-round-round
When I closed my eyes
And I thought I was blind
It's the middle of the night
And I'll never be alright again
And this wallpaper
Keeps going 'round the room
It keeps going 'round the room
It keeps going 'round the room
And I follow it around the room
And I follow it around the room
(Oooh)
Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I love you
Keep smoking, I still love you
But I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
(William! Let me out!
William!
William! Let me out, William!)
And I sat there on the steps
Considering death
There were only seconds left
Of the night
And I said hell is the sun
Burning forever at the centre of things
A ball on fire at the centre of things
A ball on fire at the centre of things
A brain on fire at the centre of things
A brain on fire at the centre of things...
I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
Used to be so human now it’s just a machine
I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
When’d you say you were leaving?
When’d you really leave?
I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
Used to be so human now it’s just a machine
I can’t turn this thing off
It keeps following me
When’d you say you were leaving?
When’d you really leave?

Hello, my name is Hojin Stella Jung, I'm a senior at McQueen High School, my portfolio is a collection of paintings - that was created during last summer, and the first half of my senior year, and it's called "The Lady", and I didn't feel very well when I painted the first, and I didn't feel very well when I painted the last. It was intense, it was an intense process, and it was how I was trying to - very hard, personify that intensity, but it's hard to talk about her now, because I think she wasn't me, at least that's how I feel and I'm trying to figure out what to do now
But she represents fervor in woman, she is powerful, yet fragile, she dares but also averts her gaze, and I love her, at least - I did, and - but now I feel lost, and I'm unsure of what to think and feel most of the time
But I did believe in her, "The Lady", and maybe, there is a different form now that the intensity takes
