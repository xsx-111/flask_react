Bodys  Lyrics
That’s not what I meant to say at all
I mean, I’m sick of meaning
I just wanna hold you
But that’s not what I wanted to say at all
I mean, I’m sick of meaning
I just wanna hold you

Is it the chorus yet?
No. It’s just a building of the verse
So when the chorus does come, it’ll be more rewarding

I would speak to you in song
But you can’t sing
As far as I’m aware
Though everyone can sing
As you are well aware
I keep so quiet
It’s hard to tell I’m alive

Everybody is swinging their hips (now)
Everybody is giving the waitress tips
Everybody’s dancing all of the dances
Everybody’s dancing every dance right now!
Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them

I have enough trouble controlling my own limbs
Stealing alcohol from our parents and grandparents
There’s no devil on one shoulder and angel on the other
They’re just two normal people

These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with
These are the people that I get drunk with
These are the people that I fell in love with

But if you keep drawing my eyes on your
(These are the people that I get drunk with)
Hands and talking to the other, let's pull out
(These are the people that I fell in love with)
The nail with the back of the hammer because this
(These are the people that I get drunk with)
One has grown old and bitter -
(These are the people that I fell in love with)
Well so what?
We're young
We're thin (most of us)
We're alive (most of us)

Don’t you realize our bodies could fall apart at any second?
I am terrified your body could fall apart at any second

Those are you got some nice shoulders
I'd like to put my hands around them
I'd like to put my hands around them

We can get real horny
And keep messing around
We can keep real quiet
Won’t be making no sound
I’ll try my best
Not to touch your face
Next time can we
Please meet at my place?

And I know that I don’t talk a lot
But I know that you don’t care a lot
As long as we move our bodies around a lot
We’ll forget that we forgot how to talk
When we dance, when we
When we dance, when we

Don’t you realize our bodies could fall apart at any second?
I am terrified your body could fall apart at any second
(Those are you got some nice shoulders)
(I'd like to put my hands around them)
(I'd like to put my hands around them)
When we dance
(That’s not what I meant to say at all)
When we dance
(I mean, I’m sick of meaning, I just wanna hold you)
When we dance
(But that’s not what I wanted to say at all)
When we dance
(I mean, I’m sick of meaning, I just wanna hold you)
I'm on a need to know basis
(I'm on a need-)
I'm on a need to know basis
I'm on a need to know basis
(Need to know?)
I'm on a need to know basis
No one tells me shit
Unless I need to hear it
I'm on a need to know basis
I'm on a need to know basis
Yeah
No one tells me shit
Unless I need to hear it11Embed
