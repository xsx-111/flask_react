Times of Grace LyricsThe presence unfound comes to me now
Endure, see this knowledge denied out of mind
To deny until I say feed us alive
Sight as I speak inside us born
Cherished and driven
The secrets of stars hide within the grey
This grey will fade, so will the stars cease to shine
Fear realized come as shape feed desolate
Cull the snake, cull path to god
Make us see, wrath to survive
Darkness looms, the moons have stricken
Showing all, constant revision
All structures collapse, mysteries unfold
Borne from the skies in these times of grace
Prey device immersion feed us alive
Sight as I speak inside us born
Cherished and drivenEmbed
