Under the Surface LyricsBehind a burning red fog
The great mind swims in confusion
Its blood ferments in anger
Honor and wisdom will cower
Your river's flow is damned all to hell
Drifting in a current to stagnate
Encircle the vision of rust
Your river's flow is damned all to hell
Strong hearts soar through blindness
Tearing the fog, tearing the eyes
To clarity
To a place where truth is seen
Your shell is hollow, so am I
The rest will follow, so will I2Embed
