The Road to Sovereignty LyricsHer rain is black rust
And melts down heavy on dreaming heads
It cuts through
She floods the haunting roads of the past
Like the dark night embraces a shadow
A fold in time brings her madness
Worn from and age from wars
A sovereign pain
A will tattered by a thousand storms
An explosion of memories echo in the skull
Faith in this will bring us all to her
We will know and feel all that is realEmbed
