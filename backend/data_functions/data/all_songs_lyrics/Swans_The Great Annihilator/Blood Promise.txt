Blood Promise Lyrics
We are poor little lambs who have lost our way
Baa, baa, baa

When silence falls and light remains
And time is born beneath the Sun
I'll hide your name inside a word
And paint your eyes with false perception
And I feel your mind in everything
And every breath destroys a sound
And I never will follow a false sensation
And I'll always believe your blood promise

Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na
Na na na
Na na

And every breath I stole from you
And I never will see your broken body
And you never have spoken an unclear word
And I'll never betray your blood promise
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na
Na na na na
Na na na


Don't stop!
Well, we are done
And we'd like to thank you for being here-
