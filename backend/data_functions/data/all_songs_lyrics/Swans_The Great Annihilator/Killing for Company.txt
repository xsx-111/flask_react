Killing for Company Lyrics
I couldn't stop myself
I knew I'd do it again
But I could heal myself
If I could feel your skin
And if I comprehend this moment
I know we'll live again
And if I heal your wound
We will make love again
And now we're slipping through this millennium
We should feel sorry for the people
And can I kiss your skin?
And there is hunger in the desert
And missiles in the sky
And every soul is interwoven
Before the wrong or right

I know we'll live again
Although it's just a feeling
I know we'll never end
Now there is no beginning
And when it's cold at night
I'll kiss your velvet sleeve
I know we'll never end
I'll keep you company
You keep me company
Ah, ah, ah
You keep me company
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah1Embed
