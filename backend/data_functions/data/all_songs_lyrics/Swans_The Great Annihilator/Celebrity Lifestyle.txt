Celebrity Lifestyle Lyrics
The secret sign of a charmed existence
Is the shiny liquid on her lips
And the ecstasy that comes with her image grows
From the power that the money gives
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
And she's just floating in space
And she's got a celebrity lifestyle
All her children want a suck and a taste of
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle
Yeah, her celebrity life
And she's just a drug addiction
And a self-reflecting image of a narcotized mind

Ah, li-life
Ah, li-life

The secret wisdom of 120 days
Is hidden deep in between her legs
And sexual transcendence is reserved for the wealthy
But is only one joy that money can make, and
She's got a celebrity lifestyle
And she's got a glowing white face, and
She's got a celebrity lifestyle
And she ties her naked children up with wires and lace
Oh, her celebrity lifestyle is the
Product of a celebrity mind, yeah
Oh, her celebrity mouth is the
Perfect image of the end of time
Ah, li-life
Ah, li-life

Oh, my celebrity lifestyle
Oh, my celebrity fear, and
Oh, my celebrity lifestyle
Oh, my celebrity fear, and
Oh, my celebrity lifestyle and
Oh, my celebrity fear
Oh, my celebrity lifestyleEmbed
