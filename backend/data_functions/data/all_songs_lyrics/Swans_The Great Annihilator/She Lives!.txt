She Lives! Lyrics
Now I just want to thank you
For going insane
Every second that you suffer
Is a loss that I gain
Every breath is a drain down
Down into a hole
And your mind is a shrinking thing:
It was crushed by your skull
Now you feel time unfolding
Deep in your chest
And your body's expanding
Now there's none of you left
So I just want to thank you
For losing your mind
Yeah you burned just like Joan of Arc
Purified by the flames

You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive!

Now I just want to thank you
For the light that you spread
And magnesium and sulphur
And the fear in your head
And I just want to tell you
You're nothing so new
Every time that you touch it
It'll turn against you
Now your future's a cold thing
Down in the damp ground
And your memory's a lead room
Containing this sound
So I just want to thank you
For killing your mind
All the life that you bleed out
Well I steal it for mine
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!
You're alive!
