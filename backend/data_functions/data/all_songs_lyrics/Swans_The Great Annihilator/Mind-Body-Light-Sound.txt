Mind/Body/Light/Sound Lyrics
Throw your mind away
Fall into the sea
There's nothing solid here
Dissolve your body today
There's a sun in the sky
We're in the atmosphere
Throw yourself in the sea
There's nothing solid down here

Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound (Mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound (Mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound

This ordinary night
This ordinary day
They're twisted out of shape
Then they disintegrate
Cool water runs through the ground
The ocean blends with the air
Throw yourself in the fire
There's nothing solid down here
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound (Mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound (Mind, body, light, soundless light)
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound

The world was over today
The time is already gone
Throw your mind in the sea
Eternity doesn't last very long
There's some people on Earth
They live in separate minds
Dissolve your body today
There is no more outside

Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound (Mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound (Mind, body, light, soundless light)
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound (Mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound (Mind, body, light, sound)
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound
Mind, body, light, sound1Embed
