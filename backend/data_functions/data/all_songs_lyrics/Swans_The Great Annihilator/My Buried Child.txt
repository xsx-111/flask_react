My Buried Child Lyrics
My frozen, empty, violent mind
Caressed the hidden hair that shines
With liquid lust I left behind
Your body stained with ruined eyes
I cut the skin, concealed the crimes
With liquid hate I left inside
And loneliness is buried here
In rotting holes beneath your fear
Your agony, your twisted struggle
Two bodies sink in meat-blood strangled
The smell of death, your tortured gash
Enfold me in your mother's arms

Now hold me in your mother's arms
Now hold me in your mother's arms
(now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms
(now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms
(now hold me in your mother's arms)
Now hold me in your mother's arms
(now hold me in your mother's arms)Embed
