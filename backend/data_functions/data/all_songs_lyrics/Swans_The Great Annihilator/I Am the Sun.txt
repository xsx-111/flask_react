I Am the Sun Lyrics
And I am the sun, I rise above the world
And when the light goes out I kill another child
And I am insane, I crawl into your mouth
I grow like a flower, I grow a suicide

And I am the sun (I love everyone)
And I am the light (I love everyone)
And I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)

And I am the dog, I cut out my eyes
Yeah I will nullify my true love creation
And I am the sun, I love everyone
I live inside your chest, I grow like a cancer

And I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the sun (I love everyone)
Yeah I am the light (I love everyone)

I love everyone
I love everyone
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone (I love everyone)
I love everyone
(I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone, I love everyone)Embed
