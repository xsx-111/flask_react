The Great Annihilator Lyrics
One second burns for a billion years
And time is relative and light is physical
We feel your body, we feel your feelings
We see the eye of god shine through the citadel
And space is empty behind the universe
The past and future were simultaneous
Inside your body we feel your emptiness
The light we breathe in is your unconsciousness

(The great) The great
(Anni) Anni
(Hilator) Hilator

And your body disappears
Burning backwards through the years
And in your hands, time was made
And through breathing, you'll erase it
And we can see forever before love and hate
And we will fall right through
The wall of the place where we were made
Right into the open mouth of

The great
Anni
Hilator
Come on in, come inside
(The great, the great)
(Anni, anni) Come on in
(Hilator, hilator) Come inside
(The great, the great)
(Anni, anni) Come on in
(Hilator, hilator) Come inside
(The great, the great)
(Anni, anni) Come on in
(Hilator, hilator) Come inside
(The great, the great)
(Anni, anni) Come on in
(Hilator, hilator) Come inside
(The great, the great)
(Anni, anni) Come on in
(Hilator, hilator) Come inside
(The great, the great)
(Anni, anni) Come on in
(Hilator, hilator) Come inside
(The great, the great)
(Anni, anni) Come on in
(Hilator, hilator) Come inside2Embed
