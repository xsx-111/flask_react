Mother/Father Lyrics
Hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey

Hey hey, now mother/father
Hey hey, now bloody mind
Hey hey, now killer father
Hey hey, now mother mind

Hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey

There's a place in space
Where violence and love
Collide inside
And solid is wide
And heat is cold
And birth is death
And creation and time
Are made from destruction
From fucking destruction (Hey hey, hey hey)
Fucking destruction (Hey hey, hey hey)
Fucking destruction (Hey hey, hey hey)
Fucking destruction (Hey hey, hey hey)

Now ride, ride (Hey hey, hey hey)
Ride, ride (Hey hey, hey hey)
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, rideEmbed
