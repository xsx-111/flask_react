Pneuma Lyrics
We are spirit bound to this flesh
We go 'round, one foot nailed down
But bound to reach out and beyond this flesh
Become Pneuma

We are will and wonder, bound to recall, remember
We are born of one breath, one word
We are all one spark, sun becoming

Child, wake up
Child, release the light
Wake up now, child
Wake up
Child, release the light
Wake up now, child

Spirit
Spirit
Spirit
Spirit

Bound to this flesh
This guise, this mask, this dream
Wake up, remember
We are born of one breath, one word
We are all one spark, sun becoming

Pneuma
Reach out and beyond
Wake up, remember
We are born of one breath, one word
We are all one spark, eyes full of wonder26Embed
