Invincible Lyrics
Long in tooth and soul
Longing for another win
Lurch into the fray
Weapon out and belly in

Warrior struggling to remain consequential

Bellow aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am

Beating chest and drums
Beating tired bones again
Age-old battle, mine
Weapon out and belly in

Tales told of battles won
Of things we've done
Caligula would grin
Beating tired bones
Tripping through remember when
Once invincible
Now the armor's wearing thin
Heavy shield down

Warrior struggling to remain relevant
Warrior struggling to remain consequential

Cry aloud
Bold and proud
Of where I've been
But here I am
Where I end

Warrior struggling to remain relevant
Warrior struggling to remain consequential


Tears in my eyes
Chasing Ponce de Leon's phantoms
So filled with hope
I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps
But the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting
Feeling time bearing down

Tears in my eyes
Chasing Ponce de Leon's phantoms
So filled with hope
I can taste mythical fountains
False hope, perhaps
But the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting
Feeling time bearing down

False hope, perhaps
But the truth never got in my way
Before now, feel the sting
Feeling time bearing down
Bearing down17Embed
