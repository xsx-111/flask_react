Culling Voices Lyrics
Disembodied voices deepen my
Suspicious tendencies
Conversations we've never had
Imagined interplay

Psychopathy
Don't you dare point that at me

Heated altercations we've never had
So I'm told, yet guided by them all
Every single one

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over

Judge, condemn, and banish any and everyone
Without evidence
Only the whispers from within

Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over
Psychopathy
Misleading me over and over and over
Imaginal interplay
Imaginal interplay
Imaginal interplay

Don't you dare point that at me
Don't you dare point that at me


Don't you dare point that at me
Don't you dare point that at


Don't you dare point that at me
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you dare point that at
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you dare point that at5Embed
