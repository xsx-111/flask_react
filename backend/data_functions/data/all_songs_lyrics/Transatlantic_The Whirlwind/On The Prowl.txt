On The Prowl LyricsBlow them down - stir up this mess
Make them think their leaders
Have become possessed
Rock the house - send pestilence
Send the whirlwind down 'til no one's on the fence
And listen to the wind - a bark and a howl
Changing voices from a moan to a growl
You best stay in because the wolf's on the prowl
Take the take - a trial and test
Take all that they love until there's nothing left
Break the banks - fill them with fear
Will they turn to me or turn to something here?
But listen through the wind you'll hear him now
Working wonders though we know not how
Before we're raised up he's got to break us downEmbed
