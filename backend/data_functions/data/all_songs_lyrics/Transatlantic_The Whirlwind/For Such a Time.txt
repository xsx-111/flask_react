For Such a Time LyricsLost in a world of a thousand ways
All our dreams turn to yesterdays
And you want to know what you're doing here
Shine the light
Make it ever clear
For such a time as this God brought you here
For such a time as this he'll give you grace to stay
For such a time as this he brought you through the mist
You've lived your life up to this day
For such a time, for such a time as this
Caught like a rat trying hard to win
Even if you do you'll still be like them
And now you can turn there's a better way
Just be still, let him lead the way
For such a time as this God brought you here
For such a time as this he'll give you grace to stay
For such a time as this he brought you through the mist
You've lived your life up to this day
Oh for such a time, for such a time as this
And when the walls come tumbling down
You'll be alright, maybe tonight
You'll feel the clouds are turning white
For such a time as this God brought you here
For such a time as this he'll give you grace to stay
For such a time as this God brought you here
For such a time as this
This is your day today
For such a time as this
For such a time as this he'll give you grace to stay
For such a time as this
For such a time as this
You've lived your life up to this day
Oh for such a time, for such a time as thisEmbed
