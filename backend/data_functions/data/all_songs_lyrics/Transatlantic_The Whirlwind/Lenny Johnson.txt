Lenny Johnson LyricsSeems things turned out a little rough on good old Lenny Johnson
He didn't qualify to put his feet up on the moon
He never won a medal and he run no fancy mansion
He's been a mess and always outside looking in
The world is bigger than a cake, said good old Lenny Johnson
He never jumped up on a bus and went away
The girls all seem to look right through the poor old Lenny Johnson
He wasn't handsome and his mind just went astray
There's no promotion waiting for a man like Lenny Johnson
No invitation wedding in his mailbox anytime
His life is just a kill of time without a real sensation
One of those lonely people, silently in line
The world is bigger than a cake said good old Lenny Johnson
He never jumped up on a bus and went away
The girls all seem to look right through the poor old Lenny Johnson
He wasn't handsome and his mind just went astray
The world is bigger than a cake said good old Lenny Johnson
He never jumped up on a bus and went away
The world is bigger than my heart said good old Lenny Johnson
He never jumped up on a bus and went away
The girls all seem to look right through all that is Lenny Johnson
He wasn't handsome and his mind just went astray
Nothing's waiting for Johnson's Lenny
He's just a boy, like so many
Others, sisters and brothers, mothers and fathers
Nothing's waiting for Johnson's Lenny
He's just a boy, like so many
Others, sisters and brothers, mothers and fathers
After all, maybe Lenny went around the world
On a bus or a plane
Never said goodbyeEmbed
