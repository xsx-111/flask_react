Out Of The Night LyricsComing out of the night - stepping out
Where the winds are warmer
It's a sudden all right - coming out of the night
Coming out of the night - stepping out
From the darkest corner
With new eyes I can see - I can do what I please
Catch your breath as you watch your step
Head spinning round as you hit the ground
Present tense time is of essence
Hold the second hand going round the dial
Coming out of the night - stepping out
Where the winds are warmer
It's a sudden alright - coming out of the night
I was once at the forefront
Once I was happy in life
But mostly I don't think about it now
I smile like I'm doing all right
Coming out of the night - stepping out
Where the winds are warmer
It's a sudden all right - coming out of the night
Coming out of the night - stepping out
From the darkest corner
With new eyes I can see - I can do what I please
By chance to meet an inner light
Your wildest dreams bring a certain fright
Doubt arisin'
From the shock
Keep your head
And lead the flock
Then we were back
In the whirlwind
Torn by the storms
Of our lives
And just
When we thought
It was over
It came
Blowin' through
One more timeEmbed
