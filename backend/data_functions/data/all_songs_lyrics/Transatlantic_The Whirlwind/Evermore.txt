Evermore LyricsDown from the mountaintop - to the river
Your deep blue secret meets the sea bed
Down from the skies - now face your forgiver
Your deep blue soul is ripe and ready
A dream of perfection of a face
Dreams to travel thru time and space
Pieces of heaven to bring back home
Traces of evidence that we're not alone
Not alone - not alone
Down from the mothership to the groundfloor
Travel these roads with a stranger's eyes
Land and water - you feel no borders
The same old people - same old cries
A dream of perfection of a face
Dreams to travel thru time and space
Pieces of heaven to bring back home
Traces of evidence that we're not alone
And while we wait we wage our wars
And send our sons to evermore - evermore!
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to be?
Is it really happening?
Is it what our minds can see?
Is it really dangerous?
Is this what God intended all along?Embed
