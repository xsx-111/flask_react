Spinning LyricsStill spinning, so beautiful
Everyday, a new beginning
Still spinning, so beautiful
Everyday, a new beginning
Crazy
They say you've gone crazy
But still you amaze me
Day in, day out
It's your magic
And the way you embrace me
With stories and faces
All about
Still spinning, so beautiful
Everyday, a new beginning
Still spinning, so beautiful
Everyday, a new beginning
Changes
A time beyond changes
The promise of ages
Under the sun
Now watching
The balance of powers
Some mighty king
Will have to step down
This big blue ball
Is spinning round
Sun goes up and sun goes down
The slightest move is making waves
It turns me on on precious days
The big blue sky is all above
Deep inside the words of love
Clouds may bring some rain today
Love will find a way
Still spinning, so beautiful
Everyday, a new beginning
Still spinning, so beautiful
Everyday, a new beginning
Crazy
We've almost gone crazy
The light we are chasing
But can't be found
Now racing
Within or without you
The silence in seasons
The time passes by
This big blue ball
Is spinning round
Sun goes up and sun goes down
The slightest move is making waves
It turns me on on precious days
The big blue sky is all above
Deep inside the words of love
Clouds may bring some rain today
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Still spinning, so beautiful
Everyday, a new beginning
Still spinning, so beautiful
Everyday, a new beginningEmbed
