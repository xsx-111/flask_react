Set Us Free LyricsLook at the people
Tossed in turmoil in the street
Satan like lightning falling down
The ungodly world
Is like a vicious troubled sea
It feels like our ship is sinking down
We have been blinded in our hearts
We want to see
And somewhere inside we know
It's not supposed to be
Come bring this ship
Out of the whirlwind
Set us free, free, free, free...
Look at the person
Who is standing to your right
See how he's slowly going mad
Watch how he smiles
And acts like everything's alright
But if you close your eyes
You'll understand
We have been blinded in our hearts
We want to see
And somewhere inside we know
It's not supposed to be
Come bring this ship
Out of the whirlwind
Set us free, free, free, free!
Set us free
Set us free
Free, free, free!
Oh look outEmbed
