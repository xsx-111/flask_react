Lending a Hand LyricsWhat am I supposed to say?
This circus rides for days and days
And after all it's somebody else who lends you a hand
I can't talk to you on the telephone
On nights like this I feel so alone
But once again it's somebody else who lends you a hand
And I don't know if I'm going to make it back
From time to time
But I know we're going to need some peace of mind
There's a kind of dread when you're at home
All the loneliness running through your bones
All I can wish is that I could be there to lend you a hand
It's a crazy life and it's hard to me
I need to get back so we can be
So that I am your somebody there who lends you a hand
And I don't know if I'm going to make it back
From time to time
But I know we really need the peace of mind
And I don't know if I'm going to make it back
From time to time
But I know we're going to need some peace of mind
No I don't know if I'm going to make it back
From time to time
But I know we really need to get some space for peace of mind
And I don't know if I'm going to make it back
From time to time
But I know we really need the peace of mind
What am I supposed to say?
This circus rides for days and days
And days and days...Embed
