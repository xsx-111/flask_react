The Whirlwind LyricsI. Overture / Whirlwind
Of no tomorrow.....
No tomorrow.....
No tomorrow.....
Catch your breath as you watch your step
Head spinning round as you hit the ground
Present tense time is of essence
Hold the second hand going round the dial
And we got caught in the whirlwind
Torn by the storms of our lives
We counted - counted on something
That never could hold up our lives
By chance to see an inner light
Your wildest dreams bring a certain fright
Doubt arising from the shock
It's your head that's back on the block
Then we got caught in the whirlwind
Torn by the storms of our lives
And just when we thought we had something
It turned into dust in our eyes
Out on the sea on a winter's day
Looking north over skies are gray
There I can see as the winds blow high
Do the storms still rage or maybe it's my eyes
II. The Wind Blew Them All Away
The wind is blowing softer now
My eyes are still a blur
With remnants all around me
I survey the ones that were
They were strong and tall
They stood so proud
And when they walked the streets
The people bowed
But when the climate changed
They tried their best to stay
But the wind blew them all away
Picture in your mind
A silent statue in the sand
A dust cloud comes
And leaves no hiding place
For beast or man
And in the master's house
They're partyin' down
But there's no resting place
In this prodigal town
But there are some we know
Thought they'd go all the way
But the wind blew them all away
In the master's house
There's an easy chair
Some would like to think
It's easy there, but if you look for long
So many have gone astray
'Cause the wind blew them all away
While they were looking the other way
The wind came and blew them all away
They thought they could stand in the stormy day
But the wind came and blew them all away
The wind came and blew them all away
They thought they could stand in the stormy day
But the wind came and blew them all away
III. On the Prowl
Blow them down - stir up this mess
Make them think their leaders
Have become possessed
Rock the house - send pestilence
Send the whirlwind down 'til no one's on the fence
And listen to the wind - a bark and a howl
Changing voices from a moan to a growl
You best stay in because the wolf's on the prowl
Take the take - a trial and test
Take all that they love until there's nothing left
Break the banks - fill them with fear
Will they turn to me or turn to something here?
But listen through the wind you'll hear him now
Working wonders though we know not how
Before we're raised up he's got to break us down
IV. A Man Can Feel
So you think you're in control?
Yet another gloomy day unfolded
Pushing panic from your door
One boss - one lie - one world order
Old classics are long overdue
New frontiers it's a scary prospect
Hollow icons - revolving doors
Pale riders of no tomorrow... of no tomorrow
A man can feel he's left out on his own
Like a stranger in his home
Now - what makes it all come apart?
A man can sense the speed of falling down
No feet on solid ground
Still time for a change of heart...
The dogs of labor leaning on their spades
That Pokerface won't stand a fall from grace
Now did you find the satisfaction needed?
Or did it leave you with an empty feeling?
Old classics are long overdue
New frontiers it's a scary prospect
Hollow icons - revolving doors
Pale riders of no tomorrow... of no tomorrow
A man can feel he's left out on his own
Like a stranger in his home
Now - what makes it all come apart?
A man can sense the speed of falling down
No feet on solid ground
Still time for a change of heart...
V. Out of the Night
Coming out of the night - stepping out
Where the winds are warmer
It's a sudden all right - coming out of the night
Coming out of the night - stepping out
From the darkest corner
With new eyes I can see - I can do what I please
Catch your breath as you watch your step
Head spinning round as you hit the ground
Present tense time is of essence
Hold the second hand going round the dial
Coming out of the night - stepping out
Where the winds are warmer
It's a sudden alright - coming out of the night
I was once at the forefront
Once I was happy in life
But mostly I don't think about it now
I smile like I'm doing all right
Coming out of the night - stepping out
Where the winds are warmer
It's a sudden all right - coming out of the night
Coming out of the night - stepping out
From the darkest corner
With new eyes I can see - I can do what I please
By chance to meet an inner light
Your wildest dreams bring a certain fright
Doubt arisin'
From the shock
Keep your head
And lead the flock
Then we were back
In the whirlwind
Torn by the storms
Of our lives
And just
When we thought
It was over
It came
Blowin' through
One more time
VI. Rose Colored Glasses
Long ago he saw the light of day
Then the wind it blew the man away
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But I believe the man is going home
Long ago he set the ship aright
Then he sailed away into the night
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But I believe the man is going home
And I know that we are more than dust and ashes
And one day we will know what we have known
Aaah!
But on the dark side
There are times of suffering
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But as the pages turn
One day we'll learn of everything
But now we see through glass...
When the ending came I said goodbye
I hope to meet him on the other side
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But I believe we have the greatest hope
But I believe we have the greatest hope
And I'll sing this as we're scattering the ashes
I believe the man has gone back home...
I believe the man has gone back home...
But on the dark side
There are times of suffering
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But as the pages turn
One day we'll learn of everything
But now we see through glass...
This world is not our home
You can live like a rollin' stone
But you cannot escape with your life
We seek a city on fire
With the heart of a child's desire
We will cross that bridge
And enter into life...real life...
But on the dark side
There are times of suffering
But as the pages turn
One day we'll learn of everything
But through the dark years
There are tears and suffering
But as the pages turn
One day we'll burn like lightning
In that city in the sky!
VII. Evermore
Down from the mountaintop - to the river
Your deep blue secret meets the sea bed
Down from the skies - now face your forgiver
Your deep blue soul is ripe and ready
A dream of perfection of a face
Dreams to travel thru time and space
Pieces of heaven to bring back home
Traces of evidence that we're not alone
Not alone - not alone
Down from the mothership to the groundfloor
Travel these roads with a stranger's eyes
Land and water - you feel no borders
The same old people - same old cries
A dream of perfection of a face
Dreams to travel thru time and space
Pieces of heaven to bring back home
Traces of evidence that we're not alone
And while we wait we wage our wars
And send our sons to evermore - evermore!
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to be?
Is it really happening?
Is it what our minds can see?
Is it really dangerous?
Is this what God intended all along?
VIII. Set Us Free
Look at the people
Tossed in turmoil in the street
Satan like lightning falling down
The ungodly world
Is like a vicious troubled sea
It feels like our ship is sinking down
We have been blinded in our hearts
We want to see
And somewhere inside we know
It's not supposed to be
Come bring this ship
Out of the whirlwind
Set us free, free, free, free...
Look at the person
Who is standing to your right
See how he's slowly going mad
Watch how he smiles
And acts like everything's alright
But if you close your eyes
You'll understand
We have been blinded in our hearts
We want to see
And somewhere inside we know
It's not supposed to be
Come bring this ship
Out of the whirlwind
Set us free, free, free, free!
Set us free
Set us free
Free, free, free!
Oh look out
IX. Lay Down Your Life
Roll up it's a storm chaser's life
With a burnin' yearnin'
For excitement every night
With the world in breakdown you run
Shout through the streets
Like an atomic gattling gun
You've got to lay down
You've got to lay down your life
You've got to come down to a place where
The low will get high
When it feels like mayhem may reign
When your mind is cold
And confusion swirls in shades of grey
When nothin's black - nothin's white
When you shiver in the darkness
Refracting from the light
You've got to lay down
You've got to lay down your life
Like rain in Spokane
You've got to fall through the sky
You've got to lay down
You've got to lay down your life
Like rain in Spokane
You've got to fall through the sky
X. Pieces of Heaven

XI. Is It Really Happening?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to be?
Is it really happening?
Is it what our minds can see?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to pass?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to last?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to be?
Is it really happening?
Is it what our minds can see?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to pass?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to last?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to be?
Is it really happening?
Is it what our minds were meant to feast upon?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to be?
Is it really happening?
Is it what our minds can see?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to pass?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to last?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to be?
Is it really happening?
Is it what our minds can see?
Is it really happening?
Is it really going to be?
Is it really happening?
Is it what our minds were meant to feast upon?
XII. Dancing with Eternal Glory / Whirlwind (Reprise)
And as the summer turns its head
Cowering to the ground
At night the winds abate to chase
Tomorrow to be found
A whisper of such tenderness
Peels through the skies of grey
The voice of one who holds the better way
Hey...
All we are, all we are, this is all we are
Just a page, just a life, reaching from afar
Take a breath, close your eyes
You'll see what you are
When you look inside your mind
Take a step, take a chance, take it where you will
Ask the light for a dance, moving standing still
Reaching out for his hand
Blowing daffodils like a million stars in the sky
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Taking a step to another land
You are dancing with eternal glory
This is much more than time and chance
When the giver of life is asking you to dance
What can we in ourselves really ever know
Just a blink in the life's swooning ebb and flow
But there's a way
There's a side you will come to know
When you go outside our time
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Taking a step to another land
You are dancing with eternal glory
This is much more than time and chance
When the giver of life is asking you to dance
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Taking a step to another land
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Don't be afraid come and take his hand
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Taking that step to another land
And you are dancing with eternal glory
There's a reason you're here, this is not by chance
When the giver of life
Is asking you to DANCE!
A man can feel his spirit hit the sky
Like a window open wide
Like a sunlit valley floor
A man can sense when all the storms are gone
And he's back where he belongs
Walking through an open door
We're on a trip in a foreign land
Reach for home, where the kingdom stands
There is the key he has given you, search it out
All who seek will find the truth!
After all the storm will pass you by
There is in the heart of the whirlwind
One who has been for all time
And he was sent to deliver
And bring forth the river of life
And we are here in the wilderness
Seeking some shelter inside
And now that it's done
Out of the whirlwind
Comes forth the true breath of life
And from the whirlwind
Comes the breath of life...Embed
