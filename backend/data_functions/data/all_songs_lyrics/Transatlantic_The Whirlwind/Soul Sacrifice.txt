Soul Sacrifice Lyrics

Well, I guess you could call me transatlantic
Cause I've been all around this world
I've played some tunes
Some quiet frantic
But I aways come back to the pool
I don't know what it is about
The way they used to be
Can put my finger on it
But it's sure it's tickle me
I wish that I can figure all
The words they used to say
From the times of that all the records
That I love to playEmbed
