Rose Colored Glasses LyricsLong ago he saw the light of day
Then the wind it blew the man away
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But I believe the man is going home
Long ago he set the ship aright
Then he sailed away into the night
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But I believe the man is going home
And I know that we are more than dust and ashes
And one day we will know what we have known
Aaah!
But on the dark side
There are times of suffering
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But as the pages turn
One day we'll learn of everything
But now we see through glass...
When the ending came I said goodbye
I hope to meet him on the other side
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But I believe we have the greatest hope
But I believe we have the greatest hope
And I'll sing this as we're scattering the ashes
I believe the man has gone back home...
I believe the man has gone back home...
But on the dark side
There are times of suffering
And I don't believe I wear rose colored glasses
But as the pages turn
One day we'll learn of everything
But now we see through glass...
This world is not our home
You can live like a rollin' stone
But you cannot escape with your life
We seek a city on fire
With the heart of a child's desire
We will cross that bridge
And enter into life...real life...
But on the dark side
There are times of suffering
But as the pages turn
One day we'll learn of everything
But through the dark years
There are tears and suffering
But as the pages turn
One day we'll burn like lightning
In that city in the sky!Embed
