Dancing with Eternal Glory / Whirlwind (Reprise) LyricsAnd as the summer turns its head
Cowering to the ground
At night the winds abate to the chase
Tomorrow to be found
A whisper of such tenderness
Peels through the skies of grey
The voice of one who holds the better way
Hey...
All we are, all we are, this is all we are
Just a page, just a life, reaching from afar
Take a breath, close your eyes
You'll see what you are
When you look inside your mind
Take a step, take a chance, take it where you will
Ask the light for a dance, moving standing still
Reaching out for his hand
Blowing daffodils like a million stars in the sky
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Taking a step to another land
You are dancing with eternal glory
This is much more than time and chance
When the giver of life is asking you to dance
What can we in ourselves really ever know
Just a blink in the life's swooning ebb and flow
But there's a way
There's a side you will come to know
When you go outside our time
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Taking a step to another land
And you're dancing with eternal glory
This is much more than time and chance
When the giver of life is asking you to dance
(Solo)
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Taking that step to another land
You are dancing with eternal glory
Don't be afraid come and take his hand
And you're dancing with eternal glory
Taking that step to another land
You are dancing with eternal glory
There's a reason you're here, this is not by chance
When the giver of life is asking you to DANCE!
(Solo)
A man can feel his spirit hit the sky
Like a window open wide
Like a sunlit valley floor
A man can sense when all the storms are gone
And he's back where he belongs
Walking through an open door
(Solo)
We're on trip in a foreign land
Reach for home, where the kingdom stands
There is the key he has given you, search it out
All who seek will find the truth!
After all the storm will pass you by
There is, in the heart of the whirlwind
One who has been for all time
And he was sent to deliver
And bring forth the river of life
And we are, here in the wilderness
Seeking some shelter inside
And now that it's done
Out of the whirlwind
Comes forth the true breath of life
And from the whirlwind
Comes the breath of life...Embed
