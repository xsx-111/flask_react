I Need You LyricsWe used to laugh
We used to cry
We used to bow our heads and
Wonder why
But now you've gone
I guess I'll carry on
And make the best of what you've left to me
Left to me, left to me
I need you
Like the flower needs the rain
You know, I need you
Guess I'll start it all again
You know, I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know I need you
I need you
And every day
I'd laugh the hours away
Just knowing you were thinking of me
Then it came
That I was put to blame
For every story told about me
About me, about me
I need you
Like the flower needs the rain
You know, I need you
Guess I'll start it all again
You know, I need you
Like the winter needs the spring
You know I need you
I need you, I need you
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
You said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me
I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes
You told me
Oh yes you told me
You don't want my loving anymore
That's when it hurt me
That feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I can never really live without you
So come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need youEmbed
