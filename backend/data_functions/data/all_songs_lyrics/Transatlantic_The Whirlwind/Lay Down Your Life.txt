Lay Down Your Life LyricsRoll up it's a storm chaser's life
With a burnin' yearnin'
For excitement every night
With the world in breakdown you run
Shout through the streets
Like an atomic gattling gun
You've got to lay down
You've got to lay down your life
You've got to come down to a place where
The low will get high
When it feels like mayhem may reign
When your mind is cold
And confusion swirls in shades of grey
When nothin's black - nothin's white
When you shiver in the darkness
Refracting from the light
You've got to lay down
You've got to lay down your life
Like rain in Spokane
You've got to fall through the sky
You've got to lay down
You've got to lay down your life
Like rain in Spokane
You've got to fall through the skyEmbed
