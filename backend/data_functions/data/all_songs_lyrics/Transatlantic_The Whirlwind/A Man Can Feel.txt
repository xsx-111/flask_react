A Man Can Feel LyricsSo you think you're in control?
Yet another gloomy day unfolded
Pushing panic from your door
One boss - one lie - one world order
Old classics are long overdue
New frontiers it's a scary prospect
Hollow icons - revolving doors
Pale riders of no tomorrow... of no tomorrow
A man can feel he's left out on his own
Like a stranger in his home
Now - what makes it all come apart?
A man can sense the speed of falling down
No feet on solid ground
Still time for a change of heart...
The dogs of labor leaning on their spades
That Pokerface won't stand a fall from grace
Now did you find the satisfaction needed?
Or did it leave you with an empty feeling?
Old classics are long overdue
New frontiers it's a scary prospect
Hollow icons - revolving doors
Pale riders of no tomorrow... of no tomorrow
A man can feel he's left out on his own
Like a stranger in his home
Now - what makes it all come apart?
A man can sense the speed of falling down
No feet on solid ground
Still time for a change of heart...Embed
