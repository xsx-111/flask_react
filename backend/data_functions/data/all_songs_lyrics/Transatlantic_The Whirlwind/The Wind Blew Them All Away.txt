The Wind Blew Them All Away LyricsThe wind is blowing softer now
My eyes are still a blur
With remnants all around me
I survey the ones that were
They were strong and tall
They stood so proud
And when they walked the streets
The people bowed
But when the climate changed
They tried their best to stay
But the wind blew them all away
Picture in your mind
A silent statue in the sand
A dust cloud comes
And leaves no hiding place
For beast or man
And in the master's house
They're partyin' down
But there's no resting place
In this prodigal town
But there are some we know
Thought they'd go all the way
But the wind blew them all away
(Solo)
In the master's house
There's an easy chair
Some would like to think
It's easy there, but if you look for long
So many have gone astray
Cause the wind blew them all away
(Solo)
While they were looking the other way
The wind came and blew them all away
They thought they could stand in the stormy day
But the wind came and blew them all away
The wind came and blew them all away
They thought they could stand in the stormy day
But they wind came and blew them all awayEmbed
