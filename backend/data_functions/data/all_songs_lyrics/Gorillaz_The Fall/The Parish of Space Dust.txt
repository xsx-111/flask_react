The Parish of Space Dust Lyrics
(Cowboy Town)
(I need a small vacation)
(Hey ubba jibba huh-wah ee ah)
Good morning, it is 45 degrees at six o'clock, in the headlines a  arrests and more storm fronts
First, let's check out the traffic reports
Houston's only home
God bless Texas 
Fly pretty high

Oh, Texas, can you hear me?
Speed up on the dawn
To the pinks and blues of Houston
In the sun
Where home is a rust
In the parish of space dust
(Where the mountains die)
And today is golden

Arrested and charged with second-degree robbery
And by the way, he was also violating probation
Now, what's the difference between first degree and second-degree robbery?
Uh, a degree,  it's as close as I know, brother, I can't help you
Have a great time over there, thanks for listening3Embed
