Bobby in Phoenix Lyrics
Let's talk about Phoenix
It's got a way of helping you to breathe a little better
(Ha ha)

Through the storm and rain
If you need to escape
Oh, you wonder why

Let's talk about Phoenix
It's got a way of helping you to breathe a little better

I can slowly see
My life fading away
In my mind and my heart, I have no doubt
Oh, you wonder why8Embed
