Shy-Town Lyrics
Friday, Chicago

The pride needs to cool, little rain didn't do it
Never got it back from you (drive away)
And you can be a fool, remember
You can ride away
Never gonna get back there

There's a red light in the moonlight
That's all, I'm moving on from you
You can try to leave me or doubt me
Oh, I'm the coolest still, right now

I'd never say good bye, little baby
Never again5Embed
