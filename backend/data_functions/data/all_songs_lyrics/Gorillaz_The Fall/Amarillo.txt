Amarillo Lyrics
The mountains are waiting
The full moon has come
I got lost on the highway
But don't ask me where I've been
Or what I've done

Oh, Lord, send me transmissions
Forgive me for what I've become
The Son has come to save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul
The Son has come to save me
Put a little love into my lonely soul

Oh don't you know why
I need her loving you
