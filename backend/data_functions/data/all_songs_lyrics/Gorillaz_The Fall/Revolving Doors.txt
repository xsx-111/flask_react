Revolving Doors Lyrics
Revolving doors, what have I done?
Someone on the TV, a tepid loss
Revolving doors, what will I become?
A redneck song

Paid up for seven
But he only got an eight now, now
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
I see no wrong in here

On a foggy day
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I sit in a diner and the Beatles play
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

I'm paid up for a seven
But I only got S.O. eight, oh, now
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I feel that I'm paused by all the pills
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
I seem to run out here
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Revolving doors
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
It's stormy on the Eastern Seaboard
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
He got silver up his nose
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)

He paid up for three
But got only two

(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Then he said
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Seems I was born for this
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Seems I was born to this
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Revolving doors
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
Revolving doors
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)
(Revolving doors in London to a foggy day in Boston)12Embed
