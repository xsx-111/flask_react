Phoner to Arizona Lyrics
You are a phoner to Arizona
We finally found a way forward
It wasn't with you
(With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, with you)
 with you, with you
 with you, with you
 with you, with you, with you
(With you, with you, with you, with you, with you, with you)
 with you, with you
 with you, with you
 with you, with you, with you
