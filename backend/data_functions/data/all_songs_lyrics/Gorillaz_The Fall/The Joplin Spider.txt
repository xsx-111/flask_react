The Joplin Spider Lyrics
(That spider) What?
(Shh, shh, long legs) I'll get you help
(It's blinding, it's just weird) That looks poisonous
(Ah, yeah) Seriously?
(Yeah, I'd say so)
(Y'know, spider venom's extra painful to primates)

Colourful sailors washed up on the shore
Caught up on bad times
Spider in the ditch, she saw it all
Went to train, ride to dance
Colorful sailors washed up on the shore
Met up on violence
Spider in the ditch, she saw it all
Waiting for the wrong time2Embed
