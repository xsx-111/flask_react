HillBilly Man Lyrics
Drive away
As in lonesome south
Like a real straight-shooter
Three lanes full
Drive away
As in lonesome south
Like a real straight-shooter
Three lanes full

Gotta ride in my heart
Get 'em going down
You don't have to be a start
To get them going 'round
Even if you try to move
Wheel it to your right
So get on, on the driving wheel
Save it for a round

Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Got a ride in my heart
See I'm going down
Cut up by the ball front
Shoot a jamboree
Just a cold lighted day
Like a memory
Just a cold lighted day
Slip a line on me

Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now

Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now
Hillbilly, hillbilly, hillbilly man, now8Embed
