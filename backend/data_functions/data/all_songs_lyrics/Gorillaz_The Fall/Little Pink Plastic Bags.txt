Little Pink Plastic Bags Lyrics
They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

Why'd you go right?
Some might go alone
What you want in life?
Someone here'll gonna get past by

They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out

They're just little pink plastic bags
Blowing on the highway alone
They don't know where they'll go
They're just gonna float out5Embed
