Blue Chicago Moon LyricsOut of the ruins
Blood grown heavy from his past
His wings stripped by thunder
But those storms keep coming back
Singing birds in sickness
Sing the same blues songs
When they fell out of the emptiness
They must have brought along
Space's loneliness
Space's loneliness
He's gotten so good at hiding it
Even he does not admit it
That glittering flash in his eyes
Makes it look like he might be alright
But if the blues are your hunter
You will come face to face
That darkness and desolation
And the endless, endless, endless, endless
Endless, endless depression
But you are not helpless
You are not helpless
Try to beat it
Try to beat it
And live through space's loneliness
And live through space's loneliness
You are not helpless
You are not helpless
I'll help you to try, try to beat it
I'll help you try, try, try to beat it
I'll help you try, try to beat it
I'll help you try, try to beat it2Embed
