Blue Factory Flame LyricsWhen I die
Put my bones in an empty street
To remind me how it used to be
Don't write my name on stone
Bring a Coleman lantern and a radio
A Cleveland game and two fishing poles
And watch with me from the shore
Ghostly steel and iron ore
Ships coming home
Where I am
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Clearly iron age beasts
You can tell by the rust and by the chains
By the oil that they bleed
A crew of crows fly the skulls and bones
They fly the colors of their homes
I fly the cross of the blue factory flame
Stitched with heavy sulfur thread
They ainâ€™t proud colors but they're true
Colors of my home
Where I am
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Every mile for ten thousand miles
Every year for a thousand years
Every night for a thousand more
I hear 'em call
I hear 'em call
Hear 'em call
They never say to come home
Never say to come home
Where I am
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness
Paralyzed by the emptiness2Embed
