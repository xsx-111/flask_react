Two Blue Lights LyricsTwo blue lights
One's the blue light of the late night bus
One's the blue light of the moon over us
Ooh, ooh
One's got the diesel fuel on her breath
One's got the damp taste of the earth on it
Two blue lights
There’s a dead archer in the tower
You can’t hear it but you can tell
When the bells ring twelve times in hell
The bells ring twelve times in this town as well
Two blue lights
Two blue lightsEmbed
