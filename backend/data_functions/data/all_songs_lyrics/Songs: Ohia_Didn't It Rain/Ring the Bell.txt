Ring the Bell LyricsHelp does not just walk up to you
I could have told you that, I'm not an idiot
I could have told you that
In every serpent’s eye, watch you go where you go
Every serpents double tongue takes a turn with your soul
If you let 'em ring your bell
Let 'em ring the bell
They’re ringing the bell
They’re ringing the bell
Why wouldn't I be trying to figure it out
Everyone tells you that
Everyone tells you not to quit
I can't even see it to fight it
If it looks like I'm not trying, I don't care what it looks like
'Cause I stood at the altar and everything turned white
All I heard was the sound
Of the world coming down around me
All I heard was the sound
Of the world coming down around me
Why wouldn't I be trying
Why wouldn't I try
Why wouldn't I try
'Cause those double tongues are singing
Hear the wail of the choir through the fog
Those double tongues are singing
I hear the wail of the choir through the fog
They're always close
They're always so close
Always close
Always so close
If there's a way out it will be step by step through the black
If there's a way out it will be step by step through the black
Why wouldn't I be trying to figure it out
It don't mean I'm not trying if I don’t make it back
I know serpents will cross universes to circle around our necks
I know hounds will cross universe to circle around our feet
They're always close
Always so close
Step by step
One's beside me to kill me or to guide me
Why wouldn't I be trying to figure which one out
Why wouldn't I be trying to figure which one out5Embed
