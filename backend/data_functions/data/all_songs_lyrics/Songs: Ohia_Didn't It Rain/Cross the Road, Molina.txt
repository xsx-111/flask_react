Cross the Road, Molina LyricsWolf-headed conjurer in the crossroads
Green-eyed alien chant brought the lightning down
Set my pulse to the short waves pulse
Set my pulse to the great lakes pulse
To wreath the moon in a headdress of neon flames
Must take concentration from that heavy old bird
Blue Chicago moon
Swings like a blade above the Midwest's heart
Swings like a blade
Swings like a blade
Swing that blade above us
Swing that blade above us
Show us how close it can get
Show us close you can get
Show us how fast we can lose it
How bad we're out numbered
Set my pulse, an electric pulse
Set my pulse to the blues
Them black sad eyes
Them black sad eyes
If I never see them again
Tell 'em goodbye
I set my pulse to an electric pulse
I set my pulse to the blues
I send my pulse to the vixens' hearts
I concentrate like that heavy old birdEmbed
