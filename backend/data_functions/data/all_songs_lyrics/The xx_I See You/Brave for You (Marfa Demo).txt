Brave for You (Marfa Demo) Lyrics
In all I know
In all I've done
I take you along
Though you're not here
I can feel you there
I take you along

And when I'm scared
I imagine you there
Telling me to be brave

So I will be brave for you
Brave for you
Do the things that I'm afraid to do
I know you'd want me to
Stand on a stage for you
If it scares me, I will try to see it through
Take a risk like I have nothing to lose
I know you'd want me to

I see things change
And I watch them grow
And I know you do too
When things don't make sense
I have courage because of you
And when I'm scared
I imagine you there
Telling me to be brave
Oh

There are things I wish I didn't know
I'll try my best to let them go
I will be brave
I will be braveEmbed
