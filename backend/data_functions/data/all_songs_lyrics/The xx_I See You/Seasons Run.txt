Seasons Run Lyrics
Here comes the rain again
It always has an effect on me
Don't know how the seasons run
I always feel like I'm in between

Do I stay inside 'til I see the sun?
Once again, let the seasons run?
Or do I step outside?

I'm somewhere in between
Lightning and the distant crash of thunder
Knowing that it's still coming
Doesn't make me any braver

My fears, my doubts
They're slowly creeping out
And they're intensified
The first drop hits my windowpane
And the emotions start flooding in

I recognize it in the air
The fading light is my precursor
But how do I prepare?
I slowly fade as the sky worsens
My fears, my doubts
They're slowly creeping out
And they're intensified
The first drop hits my windowpane
And the emotions start flooding in


Here comes the rain again
It always has an effect on me
Don't know how the seasons run
I always feel like I'm in between

Do I stay inside 'til I see the sun?
Once again, let the seasons run
Or do I step outside?
