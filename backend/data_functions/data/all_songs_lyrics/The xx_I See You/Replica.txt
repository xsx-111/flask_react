Replica Lyrics
Same right, same wrong
Only difference is that I'm the one
Second time around
Feels like the song's already been sung

Mirroring situations, accurate imitation
Do I watch and repeat?
And as if I tried to, I turned out just like you
Do we watch and repeat?

They all say I will become a replica
Your mistakes were only chemical

25 and you're just like me
Is it in our nature to be stuck on repeat?
Another encore to an aftershow
Do I chase the night or does the night chase me?

Mirroring situations, accurate imitation
Do I watch and repeat?
And as if I tried to, I turned out just like you
Do we watch and repeat?
They all say I will become a replica
Your mistakes were only chemical

Do I chase the night or does the night chase me?
Do I chase the night or does the night chase me?

They all say I will become a replica
Your mistakes were only chemical8Embed
