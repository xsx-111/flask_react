40oz. to Freedom Lyrics
Got your hair permed
You've got your red dress on
Screaming that second gear was such a turn on
And the fog forming on my window
Tells me that the morning's here
And you'll be gone before too long
Who taught you those new tricks?
Damn, I shouldn't start that talk
But life is one big question when you're starin' at the clock
And the answer's always waiting at the liquor store
40 ounces to freedom
So I'll take that walk
And I know that

Oh, I'm not going back
Oh, not going back
Oh, God knows, not going back
Not going

And you look so fine
When you lie, it just don't show
But I know which way the wind blows
A 40 oz to freedom is the only chance I have
To feel good, even though I feel bad
And I know that
