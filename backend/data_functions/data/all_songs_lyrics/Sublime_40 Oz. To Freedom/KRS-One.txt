KRS-One Lyrics
In school, they never taught 'bout hamburgers or steak
Elijah Muhammad or the welfare state

But I know
And I know because of KRS-One
Yeah and I know
And I know because of KRS-One

Because he's droppin', droppin'
Droppin' science, droppin' history
With a whole leap of style and intelligency

Yes, I know
And I know because of KRS-One
Yeah, and I know
And I know

Because we don't want to pay no money fi
Hear the same old sound
Watch and we'll take hip-hop to a higher ground
'Cause I know (how do I know?)
And I know because of KRS-One
Yeah, and I know
And I know because...
Here we go now

You must learn
And I know
And I know because of KRS-One
And I know
And I know2Embed
