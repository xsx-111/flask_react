Smoke Two Joints Lyrics"She was living in a single room with three other individuals. One of them was a male and the other two, well, the other two were females. God only knows what they were up to in there. And furthermore, Susan, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to learn that all four of them habitually smoke marijuana cigarettes... Reefers."

I smoke two joints in the morning
I smoke two joints at night
I smoke two joints in the afternoon, it makes me feel alright
I smoke two joints in time of peace, and two in time of war
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints
And then I smoke two more
"Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!"
"Toke a big spliff of some good sinsemillia"
"Smoke cigarettes 'til the day she dies!"
"Toke a big spliff of some good sinsemill..."
"Eazy-E were ya ever caught slippin'?" "Hell no!"

Daddy, he once told me, "Son, you be hard workin' man"
And Momma, she once told me, "Son, you do the best you can"
But then, one day, I met a man who came to me and said:
"Hard work good and hard work fine, but first take care of head"
Woah
Rock me tonight, for old time's sake, oh8Embed
