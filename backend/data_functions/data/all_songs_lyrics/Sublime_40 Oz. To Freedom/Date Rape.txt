Date Rape Lyrics
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Had a drink about an hour ago
Sitting in the corner by herself, in a bar in downtown Hell
She heard a noise, and she looked through the door
And saw a man she'd never seen before
Light skin, light blue eyes
A double-chin and a plastic smile
Well, her heart raced as he walked in the door
And took an empty seat next to her at the bar
"My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd ya like to go for a ride?"
And she said, "Wait a minute, I have to think"
He said, "That's fine, may I please buy you a drink?"
One drink turned into three, or four
And they left and got into his car
And they drove away some place real far
"Now, babe, the time has come
How'd ya like to have a little fun?"
And she said, "If we could only please be on our way
I would not run"
That's when things got out of control

She didn't want to
He had his way
She said, "Let's Go"
He said, "No Way!"
"Come on, babe, it's your lucky day
Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on, baby, don't be afraid
If it wasn't for date rape, I'd never get laid"


He finished up and he started the car
He turned around and drove back to the bar
He said, "Now, baby, don't be sad
In my opinion, you weren't half-bad"
She picked up a rock, threw it at the car
Hit him in the head, now he's got a big scar
Come on, party people, won't you listen to me?
Date rape stylee
The next day, she went to her drawer
Looked up her local attorney at law
Went to the phone and filed a police report
And then she took the guy's ass to court
Well, the day he stood in front of the judge
He screamed, "She lies, that little slut!"
The judge knew he was full of shit
And he gave him twenty-five years
And now his heart is filled with tears
One night in jail, it was getting late
He was butt-raped by a large inmate, and he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries
That's when things got out of control

The moral of the date rape story:
It does not pay to be drunk and horny

But that's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind
That's the way it had to be
They locked him up and threw away the key
Well, I can't take pity on men of his kind
Even though he now takes it in the behind
Date rape!

She didn't want to
She didn't want to
She didn't want to
She didn't want to
Take it!

One...
Rollin', rollin, rollin
Keep those doggies rollin'
Rollin', rollin, rollin, rawhide
Well good for leather
Windy rain or weather
Wishing my girl was by my side
All the things I'm missin'
Good vittles, love, and kissin'
Are waiting at the end of my ride
Move 'em on, head 'em up
Head 'em up, move 'em on
Move 'em on, head 'em up
Rawhide
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in
Ride 'em in, let 'em out
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in
Rawhide!
Up a whole step, Pierre
Movin', movin', movin
Keep those doggies movin'...
Don't try to understand them
Just rope, spur, and brand 'em
Soon, they'll be right behind your side22Embed
