What Happened? LyricsThree, four!

Wake up in the morning
Clock says half past one
I have no sunglasses
As I step into the sun

There's no recollection
Of the evil things I've done
It feels like I musta had some fun

*Sniff-sniff*
What happened?


Last thing I remember
I was chillin' at a party
Pinchin' girlies' asses
I was drinkin' recklessly

I know I did something
Lord, what could it be?
Woke up in the morning
And all my friends hate me
What happened?


Uh, yeah
Play it, Boy Wonder!

What am I doin' here?
Who is this girl in my bed?
What is this shit on my face?
My God, what is that awful smell?

She may be an angel
She may be a queen
She might be black, white, American, Indian or Japanese

What happened?

Threw a bottle at the bouncer
Didn't think that he was cool
Pissed in someone's drink
And threw a bike into a pool
Drivin' down the sidewalk
Like a drunken, possessed fool
I broke every single traffic rule

Aw, what happened?
What happened?
Let's go!

She may be an angel
She may be a queen
She might be black, white, American, Indian or Japanese1Embed
