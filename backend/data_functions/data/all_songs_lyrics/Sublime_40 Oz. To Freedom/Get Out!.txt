Get Out! Lyrics"It's 8:05. This is Phyllis in the office. The cat is out on the patio. If it jumps one more time, your butts are in the street. I am sick and tired of your activities, your cat, and your untruths with me. I'm gonna call you tomorrow when you're home, and you can explain a lot of things to me cause I'm sick and tired of your bullshit. Goodnight."

My place is not a home,
Don't make no difference, but I've found
That I need a place to stay
I never listen what the landlord man say

You should've seen all the flops in my house
We was jumping on walls and kicking ceilings
Nowadays, people listen to me when I say:
"Get out!"

Hold me and don't let go
Don't make no difference that you're a ho
'Cause I need a place to stay
A new disease was just the price I paid

In days of old, that's how it used to be
Oh yes, indeed
That girl is dead to me now and I sing:
"Get out!"
(One, Two, Three, Four
Elk, and bison, a gnu or two
Giraffes and elephants, quite a few)
(Let me bust a freestyle, then)
(Fuck you, mang!)
(I got a bone to pick)

(Don't sit, don't trip)
I'm cutting hits like Bert Susanka's got the shrimp dip
I get it, get it, get it, get it all the time
People wants to know the meaning of the word Sublime
It's anarchist, man, it's the shit you missed
We get the Minuteman loops and add a Peni twist
Cause we know you love the pit, but this is the shit
That you put in the box and say "Damn, it's a hit, boy!"
And at all the radios and the T.V. shows
Cause we don't kiss no ass or kick down free shows
What you get is the kind, no gang, no cess
When Yellow Lover's on the D-R-U-M-S

Let the lovin take a hold over me
Let the lovin take a hold over me
(Follow me, Long Beach posse)
'Cause all I see is your fussin' and fightin'
1992, so lets all start uniting
Put your hands together, be the best you can be
Let this jam take us to 1993
Just stay positive, the love will come back on me1Embed
