Right Back Lyrics
Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone
Your girlfriend said so
But I don't really know
That don't mean we fucked around
That night, last week, when you left town
Was tweakin' by myself one night
That's when I wrote this tune
Didn't have no need for that bed in my hotel room
Sometime, right now, since I've left the pen
Feels like I'm right back there again

Sometimes I pray
Waitin', waitin' for some bright holiday (Holiday)
So, I bought myself a gun
And I'm right back
Right back where I'm from

Sleepin' by yourself at night can make you feel alone
My girlfriend said so, she's a little ho
That don't mean I fuck around
I like to keep that higher ground
Sometimes I pray
Waitin', waitin' for some bright holiday (Holiday)
So, I bought myself a gun
And I'm right back
Right back where I'm from

Oh, don't tease me
Oh, don't tease me
Don't tease me

Sometimes I pray
Waitin', waitin' for some bright holiday (Holiday)
So, I bought myself a gun
And I'm right back
Right back where I'm from
Get back!6Embed
