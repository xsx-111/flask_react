Rivers of Babylon LyricsBy the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down
And there he went, when he remembered Zion
Over the wicked
Carry us away; captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?
So let the words of our mouth
And the meditation of our heart
Be acceptable in thy sight
Over I
By the rivers of Babylon
Where he sat down
And there he went, when he remembered Zion
Over the wicked
Carry us away; captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?
How can we sing King Alpha's song in a strange land?3Embed
