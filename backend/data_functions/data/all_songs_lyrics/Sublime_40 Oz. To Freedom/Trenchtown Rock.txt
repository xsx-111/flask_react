Trenchtown Rock LyricsOne good thing about music
When it hits you, you feel no pain
One good thing about music
When it hits you, you feel no pain
So hit me with music
Hit me with music, now, yeah
Hit me with music
Brutalize me with music
Trenchtown rockers they don't watch that
Trenchtown rockers give me your Jah
Trenchtown rockers then watch your children cry
Cuz' you've got to tell Jah why you're movin'
Kingston town, movin'
Kingston town
Kingston town
Kingston town
One little thing I've found
Is that you can't fool Jah, I know
One little thing I've found
Is that you can't fool Jah, I know
Cuz there moving, yes I'm moving
I said one good thing, one good thing
When it hits you you feel no pain
One good thing about music, when it hits you
You feel no pain1Embed
