54-46/Ball and Chain LyricsPart I: "54-46 (That's My Number)"

Do you believe I would take such a thing with me
And give it to a police man?
I wouldn't do that, I wouldn't do that
If I did that, would you say:
"Sir, come down and put the charge on me"?
I wouldn't do that, oh, I wouldn't do that
I'm not a fool to hurt myself
But I was innocent to what they done to me
They were wrong, they were wrong

Give it to me, one time (Ooh, give it to me, yeah)
Give it to me, two times
Give it to me, three times
Give it to me, four times

Oh, 54-46 was my number, what's my number now?
Right now, somebody else has that number
One more time
54-47 was my number, what's my number now?
Right now, somebody else has that number
Say, Boops say, one go with him up, yes
Say, Boops say, want keep him, keep him on him back, sing!
Say, Boops say, me want to take off her dress, huh
Say, Boops say, I've kissed and caressed
Cause we're jillin' it and we're chillin' it into the club all night
We're jillin' it and we're chillin' it into the club all night, boys
Hearin' the dog, feeling the beat, in the dog pound
D.J., "Lord have his grilled cheese"
'Cause some jealous punk
Snuck up around the back
Tried to take the lovin' over me
Lord, I got into a fist fight
And wound up in jail all night

Ah, give it to me one time (Ooh yes, mmm, my pussy)
Give it to me two times
Give it to me three time
Give it to me four time
Part II:  Ball and Chain

People, listen up, don't stand too near
I've got something that you all should hear
All lies, all the lies they told to me
Form a little part of history
I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later, a sweet baby's on the way
Kiss him on the cheek, and life's okay
I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view

It's a crazy world to live alone
A ball and chain I call my own
Ba-na-na-na-na

People, listen up, don't stand too close
I've got something that you all should know
Holy Matrimony's not for me
Rather die alone in misery
'Cause I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later, a sweet baby's on the way
Isn't that what they used to say?

When the girl you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain

I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own
Ba-na-na-na-na
A crazy world to live alone

When a girl you knew
And the bonds that we grew
Turned into a ball and chain

I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own

Because marriage doesn't work in the world today
It's an institution that is in decay
And if I have love I wish to portray
I will surely find another way
Because I was always taught that boy meets girl
Fall in love, get married and forget the world
Nine months later, the sweet baby's on the way
Kiss him on the cheek and life's okay

I don't feel no pain
I don't have no time
To listen to conflicting points of view

I step into the great unknown
On a ball and chain I call my own
