Scarlet Begonias Lyrics
As I was walking down rubadub square
Not a chill to the weather but a nip to the air
From another direction she was caught in my eye
It could be an illusion, but I might as well try
Might as well try

She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking she was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls
I knew right away, she was not like other girls
(Like other girls)

Well, I ain't never been right, as I ain't never been wrong
It seldom works out the way it does in this song
(Hey)
'Cause once in a while you get shown in the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right

It was the summer of love, and I thank the stars above
Because the woman took the lovin' over me
And just to gain her trust, I bought a microbus
Because I sold up all my personal property
A tight tie-dyed dress, she was a psychedelic mess
We toured to the north, south, east and west
We sold some mushroom tea
We sold some ecstasy
We sold nitrous, opium, acid, heroin and PCP
And now I hear the police coming after me
Yes, now I hear the police coming after me
The one Scarlet, with the flowers in her hair
She's got the police coming after me
Well, there ain't nothing wrong with the way she moves
All scarlet begonias and a touch of the blues
And there ain't nothin' wrong with the love that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by
Let her pass by
Oh, just to let her pass by4Embed
