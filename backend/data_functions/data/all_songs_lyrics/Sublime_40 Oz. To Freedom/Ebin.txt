Ebin Lyrics"You could hear the fuckin' fleas crawlin' on my nuts"

Out my window, cool and bright
Fade so slowly into night
Funny, how things look the same
Now that my friend Ebin's changed

Ebin was a cooly that I used to know
Now, he's down with the PLO
He's cold kickin' it live with the KKK
No JVC, No JFA
Cooly was sportin' black tennis shoes
Dealin', he was looking for something to use
With a pistol in his pocket and a bottle of booze
Well, it could be me or it could be you
Oh, feels like my whole life is rearranged
Ebin, you've changed
Ebin, Ebin, Ebin, Ebin, you

Oh, how you changed
Oh, you changed
Oh, how you changed
I give you a hard time, didn't want to stay
Ya got outta jail, just the very next day
Now, it's plain to see, my friend Ebin is a Nazi
He was a Nazi, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hooked on crack, just the other day
Now, he's down with the CIA
We got covert operation in Vietnam
Played a hitman, assassin, like the law's long arm
He went down to protect his country
Eat Mexican food and make lots of money
Come back up north, drive a big white car
And take himself a plane down to Nicaragua
Well, it feels like I'm the only one to blame
Oh, Ebin, you changed
Ebin, Ebin, Ebin, Ebin, you

Oh, you changed
Oh, you've changed
Oh, how you've changed

I give you a hard time, I didn't want to stay
Ya got outta jail, just the very next day
Now, it's plain to see, my friend Ebin is a Nazi
He was a Nazi, yeah, yeah, yeah

Out my window, cool and bright
Fade so slowly into night
Funny how things look the same
Now that my friend Ebin's changed7Embed
