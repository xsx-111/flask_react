New Song Lyrics
I heard that payback's a mother fuckin' bitch
But I won't stress and I won't switch
And I would not take my life
Glory, please, at God
The only thing on my mind
Takes up all of my time
And I said, ooh

Running from a gun
Or some brain that weighs a ton
My God, it hurts to get so low
Searchin' through the car
Cold, still searchin' through the night
I think I will run to you
But I refuse to fuss and fight
And God may find a reason
Well, I'm sure you'll find a rhyme
Because it takes up nearly all my time

He who stands for freedom
God knows I've got the numb
But maybe I just use too much
I was sitting in the bar
Now, I'm sittin' in that stolen car
Cold, still rollin' down the boulevard
Thought you was a queen
And the microphone scene
Think I will run to you
But I know I won't quit for me
'Cause I know God's got the reason and the rhyme
Please tell me why he takes up all my time

I've been drinking, just like you
And, baby, you got something I can use

Payback's a mother fuckin' blast
But I won't stress and I won't blast
And I would not take my life
Glory, please, at God
Comin' from Heaven above
Takes up all of my time
And I said

"Why must I feel like that?"

Running from a gun
And some brain that weighs a ton
You know, I bit that line from Flava Flav
But, all the D.J.s do it
All the D.J.s use it
I would run, I would switch
But I wanna be the same
And I know I'll find a reason
'Cause I always bust a rhyme
Because it takes up nearly all my time

The "T" here stands for treason
The "D" here stands for dumb
But, maybe I just use too
Maybe I'm just used to
Maybe I'm just used too much
