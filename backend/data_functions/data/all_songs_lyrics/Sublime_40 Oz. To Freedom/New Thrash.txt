New Thrash LyricsI've got so much trouble on my mind
That it feels just like I'm always sleeping with the enemy
But I know the real world always gets the last word
And that's why I gotta kick reality
So don't tease me, try to say that I should care
Might as well go out for mine
'Cause everybody's going out for theirs
There ain't no life nowhere
So don't tell me about a fake drug war
(Go) cut education programs more
The people will, one day, learn and rise
'Cause not everyone is out to score
People always ask me why people are all fucked up
At every corner's liquor store2Embed
