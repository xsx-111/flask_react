Waiting For My Ruca Lyrics
On the east side, that's where I met my Ramona
"I wanna go to a party", that's what she said
"Lonely, that's what I've been
Here's my telephone number, call me"
And to a party, a house party
All the bad people, just rally 'round me and love
She send the message of love

She said, "I love up the way you move
I love the way you rap", bump-bump
Ramona, please step back
Now she's my Ruca
I'm barely waiting for my jaina

She moved from Long Beach down to L.A
Right now, she's selling oranges by the freeway
I wanna know, Ramona am I the only one? Tell me

And she said, you're not the only one, but you're the best Bradley, bump-bump
And now I'm waiting for my Ruca
And I barely pulled up with my jaina
I know tonight I'll be behind her
Don't fuck around with my jaina15Embed
