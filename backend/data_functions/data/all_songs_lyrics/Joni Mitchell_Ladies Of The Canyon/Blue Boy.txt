Blue Boy Lyrics
Lady called the blue boy love, she took him home
Made himself an idol, yes, so he turned to stone
Like a pilgrim she travelled
To place her flowers before his granite grace
And she prayed aloud for love to waken in his face
In his face

Sometimes in the evening he would read to her
Roll her in his arms and give his seed to her
She would wake in the morning without him and go to the window
And look out through the pane
But the statue in her garden, he always looked the same
He looked the same

Bring her boots of leather and she will dance for him
Shyly from a feather fan, she'll glance for him
Here he comes after midnight to find her again
He will come few times more
Till he finds a lady statue standing in a door
In her door1Embed
