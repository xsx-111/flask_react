The Arrangement Lyrics
You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

While you still have the time you could get away and find
A better life, you know the grind is so ungrateful
Racing cars, whisky bars
No one cares who you really are

You're the keeper of the cards
Yes I know it gets hard keeping the wheels turning
And the wife she keeps the keys
She is so pleased to be a part of the arrangement

You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a consumer
Lying in some room trying to die
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more
You could have been more
You could have been moreEmbed
