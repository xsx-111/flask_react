Downstream Lyrics
Took a boat Sunday
Down by the sea
It just felt so nice
You and me

We didn't have a problem
Or a care on earth
And all around was silence
Everywhere

You are the reason
I was born
To be with you through all seasons
I'll always hear you when you call

We'll keep the love light shining
Through each night and day
A lonely life behind me
Oh what a change you've made

So down here on the ocean
We will stay, We will stay, we will stay
Been through a lot of changes
Turned a lot of pages
When I took a boat on Sunday
To know you as I know you now
That is all I need
And we will get along somehow
If we both believe

So down here on the ocean
We will stay, we will stay, we will stay
Been through a lot of changes
Turned a lot of pages
When I took a boat on Sunday1Embed
