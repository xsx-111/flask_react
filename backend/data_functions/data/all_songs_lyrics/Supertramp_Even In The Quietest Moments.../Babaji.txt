Babaji LyricsAll of my life I felt that you were listening
Watching for ways to help me stay in tune
Oh Lord of my dreams, although confusion
Keeps trying to decieve
Oh what is it that makes me believe in you?
Oooooooh, I know I know I know I know
Ouh yeah!
Babaji
Oh won't you come to me
Oh won't you help me to face the music
Bring it out
So we can sing it out
Help us to find it before we lose it
At night when the stars are near
And there's no one to keep you from coming here
And there's no one to shield me before your eyes
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?
I said that I can see
It's not too good for me
To be afloat in the sea of glory
Oh Babaji
Oh how you comfort me
By showing me it's a different story
Your light in the dark is real
And I know that you know it is how I feel
When I see the reflection that's in your eyes
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine to know?
Babaji
Have you a song for me
To tell the world of its guardian angel
Oh bring it out
So we can sing it out
Oh must you always remain a stranger?
At night when the stars are near
And I long for delusion to disappear
Then I see the reflection that's in your eyes
Is it time, is it time, is it time
Is it time, is it time, is it time
Is it time to know?
Oh ho-oh oh-ho
I said I'm calling you
Babaji (Babaji)
I said I'm calling you
Babaji (Babaji)
Ouh-oh-ho say you
Babaji (Babaji)
Oh can you hear me
Babaji (Babaji)
I tell I'm calling you
Babaji Babaji (Babaji)
Oh Babaji (Babaji)
