From Now On LyricsMonday
Has come around again
I'm in the same old place
The same old faces always watching me
Who knows
How long I'll have to stay
Could be a hundred years
Of sweat and tears the rate that I get paid
Sometimes
I slowly drift away
From all the dull routine
That's with me every day
A fantasy
Will come to me
Diamonds
Are what I really need
Think I'll rob a store
Escape the law and live in Italy
Lately
My luck has been so bad
You know the roulette wheel
's a crooked deal, I'm losing all I had
Soon be
Like a man that's on the run
And live from day to day
Never needing anyone
Play hide and seek
Throughout the week
My life is full of romance
Guess I'll always have to be
Living in a fantasy
That's the way it's got to be
From now on
Guess I'll always have to be
Living in a fantasy
No it won't be real in me
From now on
You think I'm crazy I can see
It's you for you, and me for me
Living in a fantasy
From now on
Guess I'll always have to be
(Guess I'll always have to be)
Living in a fantasy
(Living in a fantasy)
That's the way it's got to be
(That's the way it's got to be)
From now on
Guess I'll always have to be
(Guess I'll always have to be)
Living in a fantasy
(Living in a fantasy)
It's you for you, and me for me
(It's you for you, and me for me)
From now on
Guess I'll always have to be
(Guess I'll always have to be)
Living in a fantasy
(Living in a fantasy)
That's the way it's got to be
(That's the way it's got to be)
Oh oh, from now on
Guess I'll always have to be
(Guess I'll always have to be)
Living in a fantasy
(Living in a fantasy)
It's you for you, and me for me
(It's you for you, and me for me)
Oh oh, from now on
On, on, on...
Guess I'll always have to be
(Guess I'll always have to be)
Living in a fantasy
(Living in a fantasy)
That's the way it's got to be
(That's the way it's got to be)
Oh oh, from now on
.........
