Frankie and Johnny LyricsWell, Frankie
Frankie told Johnny
Lord, I want a diamond ring
Oh, Johnny told Frankie
I'll get you most anything
Oh Johnny went down to the German
On Rampart and Dumaine
He walked in the store
The German had a diamond in his hand
Te-na, Te-na-na
Te-na, Na-ne-na
Te-na, Na-na-na
Te-na, Na-na-n'-na
Oh, Johnny, Johnny shot the German
Lord, an he shot him through the head
He ran out the do'
And he fell on the sidewalk, dead
When Frankie
Frankie, got the news
The jury want him dead
She come runnin', hollin'
Lord, talkin' all out her head
Well, Johnny started to runnin'
Lord, and he didn't no where to do
They found Johnny hollin'
In the grocery store next door
Then the policeman
Handcuffed and beat him
And they took Johnny out of sight
He said, 'That's alright, Frankie
Ev'rything gonna be alright'
(Aaaaah!)
(Instrumental)
'Alright!'
Te-na, Te-na-ne-na
Te-na-na, Na-ne-na
Te-na, Na-na-na
Te-na, Na-na, na-ne-na
