You got bad blood, mama
I believe you need a shot
Yes, bad blood, bad blood, mama
I believe you need a shot
I said climb up on the table, baby
Let the doctor see what else you got
You got bad blood, mama
You got bumps all in yo' face
(What kinda woman is that?)
Yes, you got bad blood
Bad blood, baby Woo-ooo!
You got, you got, bumps
All in yo' face
Well, I'll say, one shot
From this needle, mama
Well, I'm sho', I'm sho'
Gon' clear yo' face
'Ah, give me the needle, doctor
Give me the needle'
(guitar & instrumental)
'Yes, ya got bad blood!'
(Aaaah!)
(Oh, yeah!)
(Oh, yeah!)
'Red one, clear, clear'
'Yeah'
'Grab some'
(Yeah!)
Well, I am yo' doctor
You can call me on the phone
Yes, I am, I am, your doctor
You can call me on the phone
And anytime you need the doctor
Said the doctor's, comin' on
