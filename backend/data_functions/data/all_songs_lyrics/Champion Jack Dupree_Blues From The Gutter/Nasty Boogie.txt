You do the nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
She do the nasty boogie woogie
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Mama bought a chicken
She took him for a duck
Laid him on the table
Wit' his leg stuck up
Yonder come the children
Wit' a spoon and a glass
Catch the gravy droppin'
From it's yas, yas, yas
They do the nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
She do the nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Well, my grandma was to old to go
She listened in on the radio
Her feet got happy
And she pulled up her dress
The first thing she hollered
'That boogie's a mess!'
She doin' the nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Nasty boogie woogie
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
'Do that boogie, now!'
(horn, bass & instrumental)
Yeah!
(Oh yeah!)
(Oh yeah!)
'Play it boy, play it, play it
'Nasty boogie woogie'
Well, grampa in the kitchen
Was drinkin' gin
Pullin' the whiskers on his chin
He heard about the boogie
Said, 'It ain't no sin'
He grabbed gramma
Said, 'Let's try it again'
She did a nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
She did a nasty boogie woogie
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
Well, nasty boogie woogie
Nasty boogie woogie
Nasty boogie woogie
Nasty boogie woogie
Nasty boogie woogie
Nasty boogie woogie
Don't you know
(piano & instrumental to end)
