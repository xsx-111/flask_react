Stack-O-Lee LyricsStack-O-Lee and Billy Lyon
They were gamblin' in the dark
Stack-O-Lee told Billy
"Billy Lyon let's take a walk"
Stack-O-Lee won Billy Lyon money
And he took Billy Lyon's Stetson hat
Billy Lion said, "Stack-O-Lee
Lord why do you do me like that?"
Now Billy Lyon begged Stack-O-Lee
Said, "Please give me back my hat
'Cause you know you won my money
Please don't take my hat"
Now Billy Lyon said to Stack-O-Lee
Said, "Please, please don't take my life
I got two little children
And a poor little homeless wife"
Billy Lyon said to Stack-O-Lee
"Would you do your friend like that?"
Said, "You won all my money
And you took my stetson hat"
Stack-O-Lee shot Billy Lyon
And he fell down on his knees
He said, "Lord have mercy
Lord have mercy if you please"
Stack-O-Lee run to the corner
And he look up and down
Said, "I'd rather see you Billy
Six feet in the ground"
Now the people start to weepin'
And some of them begin to moan
Everybody was worried
'Bout poor Billy Lyon was gone
Teena teena na, teena na ni na
Teena na na, teena ni na ni na
Say I want Louis Armstrong and his band
To play the blues
As they lay my body down
I want ten thousand women
To be at my buryin' groundEmbed
