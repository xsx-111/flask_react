Well, I got the T.B
And the T.B. is all in my bones
All in my bones
Yes, I got the T.B
And the T.B.'s all in my bones
All in my bones
Well, the doctor told me
That I ain't gon' be 'ere long
Well, the T.B. is alright to have
But your friends treat you so lowdown
So lowdown with the T.B
Yes, the T.B.'s alright to have
Your friends treat you so lowdown
So lowdown
Yeah, don't ask them for no favor
They will even stop comin' 'round
Stop coming 'round you
Well, I sent for the doctor
See what the doctor could do for me
Yes, I sent for the doctor
See what he could do for me
Do for me
He said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'
Lord have mercy on me
Oh yeah!
(guitar & instrumental)
Wow!
Yeah!
(Oh, yeah!)
Well, I know you're gon' miss me
Baby, when I'm dead and gone
Baby, when I'm dead and gone
Yes, you gon' miss me, amen
Baby, when I'm dead and gone
Well, you say I got the T.B
Now-ow-ow
I'm dead and gone
