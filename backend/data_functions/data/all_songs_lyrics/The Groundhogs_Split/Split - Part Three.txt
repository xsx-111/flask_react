Split - Part Three LyricsExhaustion takes confusion from my brain and lets me sleep
A dreamless sleep floating in an ocean two miles deep
The surface is a calmness that hides turbulence beneath
But unaware I sleep on 'til morning come
At first I don't believe the things I thought the night before
But now they come back like a torrent of ignorance once more
I can't accept life isn't a dream, it doesn't seem real any more
My mind and body are two things, not one
Time has passed and as things work out
As awareness clears the clouds of doubt
If I was sane and knew what life was about
In a world where confusion reignsEmbed
