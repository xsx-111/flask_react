Groundhog LyricsIt's a low-down dog, a dirty groundhog
Been rootin' round my back door
It's a low-down dog, a dirty groundhog
Been rootin' round my back door
Yes. if I catch him there rootin'
Well, he won't root there no more
Yes, I leave in the morning
And he hang around all day long
I leave home in the morning
And he hangs around all day long
Yes, when I leave in the morning
Yes, he hangs around all day long
Give me some toads 'n' frog hips
I'm gonna mix 'em up together
Mix 'em up good, mix 'em up together
To kill that dirty groundhog
Then when I leave home in the mornin'
Yes, he won't be there all day long
I said good-bye, baby
Baby, got to leave you now
I said good-bye, baby
Baby, got to leave you now
Yes, I did what I wanted
Yes, I killed that dirty groundhogEmbed
