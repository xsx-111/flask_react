Split - Part Four LyricsI get down on my knees and I pray to the sun
I face East at the dawn and I read the Koran
I kow-tow to a god in the shape of a man
I confess to a priest and accept his command
I look for truth in the sun and the dawn and the church
Feeling humble and servile and meek in the search
Revelation is near but is lost in the murk
Of man's own small attempt to explain life on EarthEmbed
