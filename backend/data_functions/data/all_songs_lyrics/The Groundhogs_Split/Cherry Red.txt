Cherry Red LyricsAll night long I loved her
Morning came too soon
I knew she'd be gone by the afternoon
I said "Please don't go!"
Still she said goodbye
But as she turned around she had a glad look in her eye
As she turned around she had a glad look in her eye
As she turned around she had a glad look in her eye
And I thought it said
When you look round to see me
You turn right in your bed
The warmth of my body will heat you
Make your blood run cherry red
Cherry red, cherry red
All next day I waited for her return
But she didn't show
Until I turned to look on the night
I said "Please come soon!"
Still there was no sign
But as the dawn returned that look around was just a lie
As the dawn returned that look around was just a lie
As the dawn returned that look around was just a lie
And I thought it said
When you look round to see me
You turn right in your bed
The warmth of my body will heat you
Make your blood run cherry red
Cherry red, cherry redEmbed
