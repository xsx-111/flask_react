Split - Part One LyricsIn the dying embers of a burnt-out day
When morning seems a thousand hours away
Dark prevails and the light gives up the fight to stay
The blackness thickens and surrounds
Masking all but distant sounds
I seek for thought to occupy still conscious mind
As calm and peace surround my bed
I feel that sleep is not far ahead
But in place of slumber comes a bolt of fear insteadEmbed
