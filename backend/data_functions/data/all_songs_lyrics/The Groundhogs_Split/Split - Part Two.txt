Split - Part Two LyricsI leap from bed in the middle of night
Run up the stairs for three or four flights
Run in a room, turn on the lights
The dark's too dark but the light's too bright
Reality is hard to find
Like finding the moon if I was blind
It's there so stark, so undefined
I must get help before I lose my mind
I try to think of things mundane
To get this terror from out of my brain
Everything's so mad, I can't explain
I must get help before I go insaneEmbed
