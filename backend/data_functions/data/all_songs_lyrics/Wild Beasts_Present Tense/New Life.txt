New Life Lyrics
Warm and blind
Groping in the briny deep
The tide was washing through
You were the wild one
That nothing would stick to

Sing, lungs, sing
Sing, lungs, sing

And you were right
See it
Open its eyes like new life
Mama who grew lungs
And crawled across the beach
In whom all waters meet

Sing, lungs, sing
Sing, lungs, sing

World cleave open
The line is fine, see it
Open its eyes like new life
Open its eyes like new lifeEmbed
