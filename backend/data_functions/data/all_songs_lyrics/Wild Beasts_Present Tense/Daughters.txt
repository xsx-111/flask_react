Daughters Lyrics
I'm taping up the windows and the doors
I'm nailing all my pretty things to the floor
Eyes like fire
A tempest in the water
Eyes like mine
A temper like your mother's

Daughter, please, it's me
Tell me what you've seen
Daughter, please spare me
Old men's voices screaming
And soon we'll see
What you really need
All the pretty children sharpening their blades
Where my daughter passes only ruins remain

She's walking through the cracks in the walls
She's walking across the chicken bones on the floor
Just a little girl
Jesus was a woman
Trust a little girl
And Lot who knew his daughters
Daughter, please, it's me
Tell me what you've seen
Daughter, please spare me
Old men's voices screaming
And soon we'll sleep
In pieces on the street
All the pretty children sharpening their blades
Where my daughter passes only ruins remain

From the egg
Broke my little girl
Destroyer of worldsEmbed
