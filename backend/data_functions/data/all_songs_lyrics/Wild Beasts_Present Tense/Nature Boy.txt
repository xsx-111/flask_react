Nature Boy Lyrics
Here comes a boy of all your dreams
Fists and fingers bloody
So he works all day and he works all night
Keeps you all locked up inside

I'm the thing you fenced in
I'm ten men

And ooh yes he does it all
Ooh yes where he walks
You'll feel the things you never feel
Behind this wall only love is real

Your only joy, your only bliss
Your lady wife around his lips
The things she said she'd never do
A little fun for me, and none for you


Dripping in gold he comes
Feast your eyes on that man
He's the one to teach me what I am
Now I've seen it all
Right down against the board
No fence ever held a nature boy

Behind this wall only love is realEmbed
