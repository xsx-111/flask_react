Past Perfect Lyrics
Back then, there were no others
All I knew, true beginners
We had a gift: the perfect present
No such a thing I'm taught

It's tense for me
Can't live within a memory
Proud woman, I dare not come passively
Every fella deserves his dignity

Our hurt is older than our hands
It passed from monkey into man
Now, tender hands do heal the hurt
Man did fuck up, and then he learnt

It's tense for me
Can't live within a memory
Proud woman, I dare not come passively
Every fella deserves his dignity

It's tense for me
Can't keep reliving what is history
Proud woman, now don't go soft on me
Where's that famous old dexterity?
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense for me
It's tense, it's tense
It's tense for me

It's tense for me
Can't live within a memory
Proud woman, I dare not come passively
Every fella deservesEmbed
