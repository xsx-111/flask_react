Pregnant Pause LyricsThe day drags like a dead thing
So the night is for mending
Baby, I hold your hand
Not everybody understands us
There was a tongue that we speak in
No one else got the meaning
But baby, I have
Not everybody understands us
Cause sometimes my heart hurts to watch you
There's a blind spot that I can't but get to
Sometimes you seem like a lost cause
Breathe a second, feel that pregnant pause
Speak to me in our tongue
When all the other words only come out wrong
Speak to me in our tongue-
The pillow talk patois from a land long gone
Sometimes you seem like a lost cause
Breathe a second, feel that pregnant...Embed
