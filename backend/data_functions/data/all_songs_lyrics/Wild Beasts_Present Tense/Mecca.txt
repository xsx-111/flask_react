Mecca LyricsAll we want is to feel that feeling again
Just a drop on the lips and we're more than equipped
There are some thirsts that gotta be quenched
Yeah all we want is to feel that feeling again
We didn't reach a high it was always inside
We just coaxed it from the place it would hide
We move in fear or we move in desire
Now I know how you feel I'm a pilgrim and you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us and breathed in this ether
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after
Cuz all we want is to know the vivid moment
Yeah how we feel now was felt by the ancients
Yeah all we want is to know the vivid moment
Just surrender your limbs to my every whim
Now we're lovers we're cartwheeling
We move in fear or we move in desire
Now I know how you feel I'm a pilgrim and you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us and breathed in this ether
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after
We've a mecca now
We've a mecca now, no less
To hold the other end of the thread
Hold on
We move in fear or we move in desire
Now I know how you feel I'm a pilgrim and you're the shrine to
All the lovers that loved before us and breathed in this ether
Where the body goes the mind will follow soon after
All we want is to feel that feeling again
All we want is to feel that feeling again3Embed
