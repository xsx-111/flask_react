Palace LyricsIn detail you are even more beautiful than from afar
I could learn you, like the blinded would do
Feeling a way through the dark
In the darkened house of love
I felt like I was sleeping rough
The bath ran cold
But this is a palace and that was a squat
Baby there's have alls and there are have nots
I'm happy with what I got
Winter was long, now we've come to feast
We may be savage and raw but at the core
We've higher needs
A palace, it's our palace
The past pulls faces of those who vaguely resemble love
But weren't close enough
You remind me of the person I wanted to be
Before I forgot
A palace, it's our palaceEmbed
