Sweet Spot LyricsThe sweetest spot
When it's gone, it's gone
Don't make me suffer for that
Just allow me
A final divine act
Between the hurt and the tell of song
Between the flesh and the fondest wrong
There is a gardless state
Where the real and the dream may consummate
The sweetest spot
When it's gone, it's gone
Don't make me suffer for that
Just allow me
A final divine act
Between the wound and end
Between the break and the mend
Between the want and the get
Between bone dry and the dripping wet
It's in the holy ghost of air
Between two hands held in prayer
There is a gardless state
Where the real and the dream may consummate
The sweetest spot
When it's gone, it's gone
Don't make me suffer for that
Just allow me
A final divine actEmbed
