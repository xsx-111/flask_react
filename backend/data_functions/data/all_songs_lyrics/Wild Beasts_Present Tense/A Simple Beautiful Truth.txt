A Simple Beautiful Truth Lyrics
Woman, we don't need to pretend anymore
It's real, it's real
Let your loving be the proof, I can tell that it's the truth
By the feel, by the feel
There's a beauty out there, you just gotta know where
It's there, yeah
Let your loving be the proof, I can tell that it's the truth
By the feel, by the feel

Yeah, gonna show you where
A simple beautiful truth
Yeah, gonna show you where
A simple beautiful truth

Sober dream, thought I buried you too deep
Yet, yet
You come blinking in the sun, I can tell that you're the one
By the feel, by the feel
A simple beautiful love is worth countless triumphs
When it's real, when it's real
Let your loving be the proof, I can tell that it's the truth
By the feel, by the feel
Yeah, gonna show you where
A simple beautiful truth
Yeah, gonna show you where
A simple beautiful truth

A simple beautiful truth
A simple beautiful truth
A simple beautiful truth
A simple beautiful truth2Embed
