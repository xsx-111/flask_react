Dreams By the Sea LyricsNo, no, no, no - it can't be true
No, no, no, no - it isn't you
No, no, no, no - it's not the way you are
No, no, no, no - it isn't you
No, no, no, no - it can't be true
No, no, no, no - it's not the way you are
Bad dreams for me
Bad dreams by the sea
Dreaming you've got a lover
Dreaming I got another
Dreaming that there's a killer in your eyes
Dreaming that you're a user
Dreaming that I'm a loser
Dreaming that there's a killer in my eyes
Bad dreams for me
Bad dreams by the sea
Dreaming about a place of shades
Dreaming about the ace of spades
Dreaming about us taking things too far
No, no, no, no - it can't be you
No, no, no, no - it isn't true
No, no, no, no - it's not the way you are
Bad dreams for me
Bad dreams by the seaEmbed
