Keep On LyricsI went walking with my baby
Just the other loving day
She said keep on baby keep on
Walking with my baby
Just the other loving day
She said keep on baby keep on
Keep on doing what you do to me
Keep on saying what you say
Keep on baby won't you keep on with me everyday
Keep on baby keep on
Keep on with me every day
Keep on baby keep on
Hmm, every day
Do to me, Keep on like you do
Keep on darling, keep on until we're through
With my lover just the other living day
She said keep on baby keep on
Keep on with my lover just the other lovely day
She said keep on baby keep on
Keep on babe what you do to me
Keep on saying what you say
Keep on little darling
Keep on with me every day
I went walking with my baby
Just the other loving day
She said keep on baby keep on
Walking with my baby
Just the other lonely day
She said keep on baby keep on
Keep on doing what you do to me
Keep on saying what you say
Keep on baby won't you keep on with me everyday
Keep on baby keep on
Keep on every day
Keep on baby keep on
Keep on baby day
Hmm...Embed
