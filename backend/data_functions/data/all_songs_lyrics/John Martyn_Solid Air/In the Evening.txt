In the Evening LyricsShe was the moon and my unveiling
And needed she did watch me grow
Now she's walking where it's shady
Seems so strange to watch her go
And all but the time keeps happening on
Love keeps singing a song in the evening
Slowly fading gently jaded
And sliding evening of my eye
Boats are leaving leaves are crumbling
And autumn's here and trying to cry
And all but the time keeps happening on
Love keeps singing a song in the evening
Going faster getting older
And all the timе is just today
Got so many ways to see it
Not so many ways to say
The time keeps happening on
Lovе keeps singing a song in the eveningEmbed
