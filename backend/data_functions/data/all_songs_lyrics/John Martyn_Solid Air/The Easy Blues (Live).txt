The Easy Blues (Live) LyricsMister jelly roll baker
Can I please be your slave?
When Gabriel blows his horn
I'm going to rise from my grave
For your sweet jelly roll
You bake the best jelly roll in town
You're the only man bakes jelly
And you keep your devil down
They say "Can I place an order for three weeks ahead"
I'd rather have your jelly than my home-baked bread
'Cause I'm just crazy about you jelly
I'm so wild about your jelly roll
You're the only man bakes jelly
And you keeps it in your soul
You can take all my women
You can sure keep them all
I got a brand new secret
That you can't catch on to at all
I'm a jelly roll baker
I bake the best jelly roll in town
I'm the only man bakes jelly
And I keep my devil down
I'm the only man bakes jelly and I keep my devil down
I'm the only man bakes jelly and I keep my devil down
I'm the only man bakes jelly and I keep my devil down
Underneath the trees, jelly in my knees
Got those gentle blues
Got me on the floor, got me screaming out for more
Of your gentle blues
Trying to get to you all day
I've been trying to get to hear you say
That you're never going to let me lose my gentle bluesEmbed
