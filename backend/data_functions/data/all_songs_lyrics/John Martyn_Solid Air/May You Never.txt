May You Never LyricsAnd may you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
You’re just like a great strong brother of mine
You know that I love you true
And you never talk dirty behind my back
And I know that there’s those that do
Oh please won’t you, please won’t you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
Now please won’t you, please won’t you
Bear it in mind for me
And may you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
Well you’re just like a good close sister to me
You know that I love you true
And you hold no blade to stab me in the back
And I know that there’s some that do
Oh please won’t you, please won’t you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
And please won’t you, please won’t you
Bear it in mind for me
May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
You’re just like a great strong brother of mine
And you know that I love you true
And you never talk dirty behind my back
And I know that there’s those that do
Oh please won’t you, please won’t you
Bear it in mind
Love is a lesson to learn in our time
And please won’t you, please won’t you
Bear it in mind for me
May you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar room fight
May you never lose your woman overnight
May you never lay your head down
Without a hand to hold
May you never make your bed out in the cold
May you never lose your temper
If you get in a bar room fight
May you never lose your woman over night
May you never lose your woman over night
May you never lose your woman over night2Embed
