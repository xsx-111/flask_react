The Baby Boy LyricsThe Virgin Mary had a baby boy
The Virgin Mary had a baby boy
The Virgin Mary had a baby boy
And they gave him the name of Jesus
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
Oh yes, Believer, oh, yes, Believer
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
The wise men saw when the baby born
The wise men saw where the baby born
The wise men went where the baby born
And they said that his name was Jesus
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
Oh yes, Believer, oh, yes, Believer
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
They saw the star over Bethlehem
That glorious star over Bethlehem
The trailed that star over Bethlehem
To the crib of the child named Jesus
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
Oh yes, Believer, oh, yes, Believer
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
They found a manger in Bethlehem
A lowly manger in Bethlehem
And in that manger in Bethlehem
They worshipped the child named Jesus
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious Kingdom
Oh yes, Believer, oh, yes, Believer
He came from the Glory
He came from the Glorious KingdomEmbed
