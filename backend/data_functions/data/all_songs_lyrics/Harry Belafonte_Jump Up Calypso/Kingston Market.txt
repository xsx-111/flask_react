Kingston Market Lyrics
Have you ever seen a rainbow
Or a garden blooming bright
Heard the shuffle of a thousand feet
Drums from morning 'til night?

Come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston Market

Get your tamarind and sour sop
Mangoes and casaba
Bread fruit, okra, pigeon peas
Curry goat and guava

Oh, come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston market

Do you know a brown skin maiden
With sunshine in her eyes?
Heard the swallow and the hummingbird
Sing happy as she goes by?
Have you seen the ghost of Morgan
Or heard a tale you hadn't ought to?
Have you welcomed the coming dawn
With a rum and coconut water?
Come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston market
Come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston Market

Come we go down, come we go down
Come we go down to Kingston Market
Come we go down, come we go down
Down to Kingston MarketEmbed
