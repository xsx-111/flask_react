Monkey LyricsOne Monday morning I got up late
And there was Mr. Monkey outside me gate
One Monday morning I got up late
There was Mr. Monkey outside me gate
Don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
My girl came over to have a drink
I came downstairs and what do you think?
The monkey had run and he let her in
He poured her a glass of me favorite gin
I don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Well I drink gin monkey drink gin too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
I ran to de yard to get a stick
But I'm tellin you friends that monkey was quick
'Cause when I returned much to my disgrace
Mr. Monkey had my girl in a manly embrace
I don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Yessah! Up!
Ah play dat ting!
Round de corner!
Hep!
I went to me bath for a Burma Shave
This monkey going put me in a me grave
The entire cabinet was laid to waste
I had to shave with some Gleem toothpaste
I don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Well I go to shave monkey go shave too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Well by dis time I was in despair
I was using de shoebrush to brush me hair
I ask him to leave but he stayed around
He pulled de chain and I almost went down
I don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Yep!
Yessah! Play sah!
Mariposa!
Yep!
Chuka! Chuka!
Well me patience run out and I'm telling you sure
Tomorrow I'm going show dat monkey de door
And if he don't leave I'm inviting you
To me house for dumplings and monkey stew
Don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
I don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
When I drink gin monkey drink gin too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
When I go (pop) monkey go (pop) too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
When I go brrp! Monkey go brrp! too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
When I go down monkey go down too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
When I go up monkey go up too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
I don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
When I go (smooch) monkey go (smooch) too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
When I play drum monkey play drum too
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
I don't know what to say de monkey won't do
(Don't know what to say de monkey won't do)
Don't know what to say de monkey won't do
