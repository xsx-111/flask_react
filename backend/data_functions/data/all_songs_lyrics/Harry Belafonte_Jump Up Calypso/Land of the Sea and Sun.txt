Land of the Sea and Sun Lyrics
Many nights I sit here
With memories by the score
Thinking of the nights I spent
With the girl I still adore

So I'm going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her in the land of the sea and sun

Once I had a notion
'Bout this Bajin girl
I put my thoughts in motion
And found my heart in a whirl

So I'm going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her in the land of the sea and sun

Ever since I left here
Nothing's been the same
Think I'll pull up anchor, yes
Going back and give her my name
Going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her in the land of the sea and sun

Yes, I'm going back to see her
Before my days are done
Going back to see her in the land of the sea and sunEmbed
