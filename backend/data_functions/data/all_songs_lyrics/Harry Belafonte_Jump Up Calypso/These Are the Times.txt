These Are the Times LyricsWhen tides at ease on the evening breeze
And the scarlet moon starts its gentle rise
The drowsy whale spouts a misty trail
And the stars gather slowly in the skies
These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again
Back to my girl down in Port of Spain
On some distant shore as I walk the sand
And watch the lovers meet
They stand in the moonlight hand in hand
With the surf breaking over their feet
These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again
Back to my girl down in Port of Spain
In Mandalay at a gay cafe
In the wee little hours of morn
When guitars and violins end their play
With a hymn to the goddess of dawn
These are the times when I know
How alone one can be
And I yearn to go once again
Back to my girl down in Port of SpainEmbed
