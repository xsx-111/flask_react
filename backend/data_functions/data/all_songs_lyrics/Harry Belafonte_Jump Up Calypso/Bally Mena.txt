Bally Mena LyricsBally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black
Brothers we were and brothers we'll be
I till the soil and you sail the sea
To the ship Bally Mena you gave your best
But a raging sea laid your soul to rest
Bally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black
No more to hear, to hear the tale
Of how you tamed a mighty whale
And the girl who waited so patiently
Will walk no more by the sea
Bally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bally Mena, Bally Mena, Bally Mena in the harbor
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena black
Bring the Bally Mena to the dock
And paint the Bally Mena blackEmbed
