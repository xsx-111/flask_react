Jump in the Line Lyrics
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time

My girl's name is Senora
I tell you friends, I adore her
And when she dances, oh brother!
She's a hurricane in all kinds of weather

(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time

You can talk about Cha Cha
Tango, Waltz, or the Rumba
Senora's dance has no title
You jump in the saddle
Hold on to de bridle
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time

Senora, she's a sensation
The reason for aviation
And fellas, you got to watch it
When she wind up, she bottom, she go like a rocket

(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Hoist those guns a little higher!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Up the chimney!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora, work your body line
Work, work, work, Senora, work it all the time
Senora dances Calypso
Left to right is the tempo
And when she gets the sensation
She go up in the air, come down in slow motion

(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Okay, I believe you!
(Jump in the line, rock your body in time) Whoa!

Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake your body line
Shake, shake, shake, Senora, shake it all the time
Work, work, work, Senora!3Embed
