Ring of a Change LyricsI look back and I open my eyes
I hear the words like they should be heard
And it feels like a ring of a bell echoing through me
I look back and it's never the same
And that's the way that it ought to be
What I feel is the sound of a change echoing through me
Move into the light
Come on into the light
Move into the light
I'll see you in the light, all right
I think on and I think of today
And what today is gonna be for us
Will we find all the peace that is there and needs to taken
I think on and think its a must
That we slow down for just a while
And I think there's an ounce of a change echoing through me
Move into the light
Come on into the light
Move into the light
I'll see you in the light, all right
I look back and I think of a song
I change the words round to make a rhyme
But the song is the same and the change is echoing through me
I look back and it's never the same
I leave the song like it use to be
But I know there's a ring of a change echoing through me
Move into the light
Come on into the light
Move into the light
I'll see you in the light, all right2Embed
