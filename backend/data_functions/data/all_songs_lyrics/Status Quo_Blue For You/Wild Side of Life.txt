Wild Side of Life LyricsWell you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
Well there's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of a song
Now the glamour of the gay night-life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Well you went to be somebody else's baby
And forget the truest love you've ever known
I never knew there were honky-tonk angels
Oh I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one who ever loved you
And went back to that wild side of life
Now the glamour of the gay night-life has lured you
To the places where the wine and liquor flow
Well you went to be somebody else's baby
And forget the truest love you've ever known
I never knew there were honky-tonk angels
Oh I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one who ever loved you
And went back to that wild side of life
I never knew there were honky-tonk angels
Oh I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one who ever loved you
And went back to that wild side of lifeEmbed
