You Lost the Love LyricsThe little things you say to me
The little things you do
And all the things you're asking me
Are things we shouldn't do
And when you try to be someone
Someone that isn't you
I sit and wait the time for you
When you return I feel
I feel you lost the love I handed to you
You lost the love I gave
Oh yes, you lost the love I handed to you
Oh, you lost the love I gave
And when you go away from me
I'm feeling peace of mind
So will you ever come to me
To see if you can find
That kind of love is gone in you
You like the tears and pain
You lost yourself along the way
Left me ours again (??)
Yeah, you lost the love I handed to you
You lost the love I gave
Oh yes, you lost the love I handed to you
Oh, you lost the love I gave
If you return and say to me
You want your 'this and that'
Just think of all those little things
And where they left us at
Because you lost the love I handed to you
You lost the love I gave
Oh yes, you lost the love I handed to you
Oh, you lost the love I gave
Yeah, you lost the love I handed to you
You lost the love I gave
Oh yes, you lost the love I handed to you
Oh, you lost the love I gaveEmbed
