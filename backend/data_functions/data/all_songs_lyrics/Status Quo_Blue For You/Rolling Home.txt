Rolling Home LyricsMe and my lady love the way you're movin'
Me and my lady love
All night long you've got us up and groovin'
Reelin' and rollin' along
Saturday night you made it alright
And everyone liked your reelin' and rollin' along
Me and my lady love the way you're rollin' home
Late last night my motor broke a rotor
Broken down by the road
Even though I need it I just had to leave it
Head down to the show
There in the crowd my lady I found
Movin' around reelin' and rollin' along
Me and my lady love the way you're rollin' home
Don't you ever lose it don't you ever blues it
Don't you ever change your way
People try to ban you don't they understand you
Don't you think that's a shame
I was alone no where to go
Now I've a love and a lady to take me along
Me and my lady love the way you're rollin' home
Me and my lady love the way you're rollin' home
Me and my lady love the way you're rollin' homeEmbed
