Take on the World LyricsWell, I hate my writing
It's all the same
But it trips like posture
My head just hangs
And I hate myself, man
But who's to blame?
I guess I'm just see-through
Window panes
Because if it's our way
To take on the world
It would be something
To take on the world
It would be something
To take on the world
It would be something
To take on the world
It would be something
Something
Something
I still hate my music
It's all the same
But it trips like posture
My head just hangs
And I hate myself, man
But who's to blame?
I guess I'm just fucked up
Or too insane
Because if it's our way
To take on the world
It would be something
To take on the world
It would be something
To take on the world
It would be something
To take on the world
It would be something
Something
