Mutant LyricsWell I'm so lonely I could die
Put the fingernails in my eyes
You could sparkle bright
But keep it inside
'Cause no one wanna see the light
'Cause the sun won't ever come
No the sun won't ever come
Well I'm so lonely I could die
Put the fingernails in your eyes
You could sparkle bright
But keep it inside
'Cause no one wanna see the light
'Cause the sun won't ever come
No the sun won't ever comeEmbed
