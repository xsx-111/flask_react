King of the Beach LyricsLet the sun burn my eyes
Let it burn my back
Let it sear through my thighs
I'll feel wide wide open
Let the sun burn my eyes
Let it burn my back
At the beach
In my dreams
But you still
You're never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop
King of the beach
King of the beach
Let the sun burn my eyes
Let it burn my back
Let it burn through my thighs
I'll feel wide wide open
At the beach I'm with Jeans
And it's wide wide open
At the beach
In my dreams
But you still
You're never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop
King of the beach
Never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop me
You're never gonna stop
King of the beach
King of the beach
King of the beach
King of the beach
