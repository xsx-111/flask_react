Stained Glass LyricsWon't you let me into your heart
Won't you let me in through the centre
You and me will never part
Because if we did I will die girl
Kill whoever it is
Tear out the eyes of Jesus Christ
Bathe in the blood of the moon
In my mind
Won't you let me into your heart
Won't you let me in through the centre
You and me will never part
Because if we did I will die girl
Won't you let me into your heart
Won't you let me in through the centre
You and me will never part
Because if we did I will die girl
Kill whoever it is
Tear out the eyes of Jesus Christ
Bathe in the blood of the moon
In my mind
My mind
Stained glass
Stained
Won't you let me into your heart
Won't you let me in through the centre
You and me will never part
Because if we did I will die girl
Die girl, die girl, die girl
Die girl, die girl, die girl
Die girl, die girl, die girl
Die girl, die girl, die girlEmbed
