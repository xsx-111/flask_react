Baby Say Goodbye LyricsI hear a voice in the morning shower
Seen her waving from the water tower
Seen her falling through the fog in the mirror
Seen her waving from a painted island
And that's my baby say goodbye
Without my baby let me die, oh yeah
Die, uh huh
I just don't feel okay without her near me
Keep on clutching onto life so dearly
It filters into me through every pore
The haunting light under the bedroom door
And that's my baby say goodbye
Without my baby let me die, oh yeah
Die, uh huh
Baby say goodbye (oh yeah)2Embed
