Post Acid Lyrics
Misery
Will you comfort me?
In my time of need
Would you understand?

Understand, won't you understand?
In my time of need
Would you understand?

That I'm just havin fun
That I'm just havin fun

With you
With you
With you
With you

Hold my hand
Won't you hold my hand
In my time of need
Would you understand?
Understand, won't you understand
In my time of need
Would you understand?

That I'm just havin fun
That I'm just havin fun
That I'm just havin fun
That I'm just havin fun

With you
With you
With you
With you

You-oo-oo-oo-oo
