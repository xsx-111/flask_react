Idiot LyricsLaugh, I bet you laugh
I bet you laugh right behind my back
I won't ever die
I'll go surfing in my mind
I'm not supposed to be a kid
But I'm an idiot
I'd say I'm sorry
But it wouldn't mean shit
Ah my skull just cracked
I didn't bother listening to the rest
I won't ever die
I'm a hero in my mind
I'm not supposed to be a kid
But I'm an idiot
I'd say I'm sorry
But it wouldn't mean shit
But it wouldn't mean shit1Embed
