Super Soaker LyricsThe day's done
She won't listen
She won't listen
My head's numb
And I can't hear her
Any clearer
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cruise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cruise
My alien
He's still missing
He's still missing
My brain's numb
And I can't hear ya
Any clearer
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cruise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cru-u-u-uuise
Cru-cruise
Wipe all the sweat from my eyes
And hide from the ocean
Waves crush my flesh and skull
But I still feel stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!Embed
