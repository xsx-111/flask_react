When Will You Come LyricsSun, when will you come?
When will you come?
When will you come?
Come!
Come!
Sun, we whistle at the breeze!
Sun, we're sicker than we seem!
Sun, we whistle at the breeze!
Sun, we're sicker than we seem!
Sun, we whistle at the sea!
Sun, we whistle, now we're sick!
Sun, we whistle at the breeze!
Sun, we're sicker than we seem!Embed
