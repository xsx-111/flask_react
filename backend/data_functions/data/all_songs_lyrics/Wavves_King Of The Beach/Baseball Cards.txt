Baseball Cards LyricsI don't walk outside
Cause where would I go?
We won't know
Time takes its toll
And where would I go?
We won't know
Because I don't wanna walk outside
Because I don't wanna walk outside
Because I don't wanna walk outside
I don't wanna walk outside
Cause where would I go?
Well I don't know
Time takes its toll
And where would I go?
We don't know
Because I don't wanna walk outside
Because I don't wanna walk outside
Because I don't wanna walk outside
I don't wanna walk outside without youEmbed
