Green Eyes LyricsGreen eyes
I'd run away with you
Green eyes
'Cause I'm a fool
I tried running away
I'm just not fast enough
I'm just not fast enough
My
My own friends
Hate my guts
So what?
Ah, so what?
Who gives a fuck?
Green eyes
I'd run away with you
Green eyes
'Cause I'm a fool
I tried staying away
I'm just not man enough
I'm just not man enough
My
My own friends
Hate me
But I don't give a shit
Sky high
Will I fly high?
Maybe
So I'll soar right through it
Green eyes
I'd run away with you
Green eyes
'Cause I'm a fool
I tried running away
I'm just not fast enough
I'm just not man enough
I would try and understand
I would try and understand
That I'm to blame
'Cause I'm so lame
I'm just not man enough
I'm just not man enough
My
My own friends
Hate me
But I don't give a shit
Fly high
Will I fly high?
Maybe
So I'll soar right through it3Embed
