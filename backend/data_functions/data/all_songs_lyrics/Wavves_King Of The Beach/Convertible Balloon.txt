Convertible Balloon LyricsShinin' in the sun like a convertible balloon
Shinin' in the sun like an incredible gloom
Drivin' around with my convertible tunes
Partyin' around in my invertible cocoon
Lyin' inside of my insufferable womb
Boggin' me down with your unbearable tone
Sittin' alone playin' nintendo in my room
Lyin' inside of a convertible cocoon
Sittin' alone playin' nintendo in my room
Lyin' inside of a convertible balloon
Convertible balloon
