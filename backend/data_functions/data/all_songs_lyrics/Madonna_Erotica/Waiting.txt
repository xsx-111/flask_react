Waiting Lyrics
Well, I know from experience
That if you have to ask for something more than once or twice
It wasn't yours in the first place
And that's hard to accept when you love someone
And you're led to believe in their moment of need
That they want what you want but they don't

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify this

Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
It was so easy in the beginning
When you didn't feel like running from your feelings
Like you are now
What happened?
What do I remind you of?
Your past? Your dreams?
Or some part of yourself that you just can't love?
I wish I could believe you
Or at least have the courage to leave you

Life has taught me that love with a man like you
Is only gonna make me blue
But I love you anyway no matter what you do
You don't come around here like you did before
When you did adore
Tell me what I did to deserve this

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
Just waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place

Don't go breaking my heart like you said you would
Baby, you're no good
And you hurt me like no other lover ever could
Don't go making me cry
You're gonna say goodbye
Baby, tell me why
Tell me why or you're gonna have to justify

I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Finally I see a different man
Only love can hurt like this can
Finally I see a different face
Tell me who is going to take my place
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart
Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

I knew it from the start that you would desert me (Waiting for you)
You're gonna break my heart (Just waiting)
Baby, please don't hurt me
I knew it from the start that you would desert me (Waiting for you)
You're gonna break my heart
Baby, please don't hurt me

Waiting for you
I'm waiting
Can't you see?
I'm waiting for you
Don't break my heart

Break my heart (Waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (Just waiting)
Break my heart (Waiting for you)
Don't break my heart
Break my heart (Waiting for you)
Don't break my heart (Just waiting)
Break my heart (Waiting for you)
You broke my heart
You broke my heart (Waiting for you, just waiting)
You broke my heart (Waiting for you)

And the next time you want pussy...
Ha!
Just look in the mirror, baby
