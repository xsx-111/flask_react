Did You Do It? Lyrics
Tell me
We're gonna do that when we finish?
Yo, what's up?
What are we gonna do after we finish this?

Tick tick tock, Mo is on the jock
I did her in the limo as we went around the block
Sucked the mole on her hip, licked the lipstick off her lip
She got real excited, yo she started to flip
She says, "'Dré baby 'Dré baby, oh"
I said, "Just relax, ayo chill, Mo"
We made a right turn onto Central Park West
One hand gripped the car, the other on her breast

Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

Uh, ho's in the front for the 1990's
Walking around showing off their heinies
Wiggling, they're jiggling, they're swinging and flinging
9-7-0, yo ho, your phone's ringing
You get a call from your John, you meet him at the mot'
He's chilling in a pamper and a fur coat
Your head starts spinning, you drunk too much gin and
Your jaw starts grinning, and this is the beginning
Of a night of an average ho
It ain't all about working on the streets no more
Here's another episode of dropping off a load
Peter was on the beater, I was about to explode
I couldn't hold back (So, whatcha do?)
I took her to my place (Yo, did she sit on your face?)
She was so good just like uh, Campbell's Soup
I won't try to front so here's the rude scoop
I dipped it and I stripped it and I ripped it like before
I had her screaming, nope no diddily, nope no more
I can't stop once I get started
But yo honey, uh, get them legs parted
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
Did you do it? I said I did it
But I backed out quick because I thought I split it

Oh, my God!
They come with the rough stuff
Boy, we hit it, split it, and forget it
In the same order as you hear
But boy I'm not fronting
Don't ask what, me tell you the truth, you understand me eye?
The iron eye can get pissy, you know what I'm saying?
Clean up me rifle, clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, me elephant rifle
Clean up me rifle, you clean up me rifle
Clean up me rifle, elephant rifle
You know, you know, you moving slow
You make them tingle, yeah, you make them tingle
I flipped her from the top of my head, enough said
I'm the brother with the short, short dreads
A couple different styles, a couple different flows
Just some that my souls about some girls I know
I gotta hit it hard because I go for the gusto
And I cover up the moans by turning up my stereo

Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
Did you do it? You know I did it
I let the seat recline and I hit it
Did you do it? Yo, you know I did it
Did you do it? Yo Mark, I said I did it
Did you do it? Yo
I backed out quick 'cause I thought I split it

You didn't do it, he didn't do it
I made her go

Waiting for you, just waiting
(Yo man, she been waiting, she keep on waiting)
Waiting for you
(Yeah, she been waiting, and you have not hit it)
Waiting for you, just waiting
Waiting for you

Yo, Dré... Dré!
Yo man, you're so loud, Goddamn
What's up?
Yo, we printing this mix?
I thought you did that already
You know I did it2Embed
