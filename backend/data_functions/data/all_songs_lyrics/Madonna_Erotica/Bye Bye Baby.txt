Bye Bye Baby Lyrics
This is not a love song
Bye bye baby

I keep on waiting, anticipating
But I can't wait forever
You say you love me, you're thinking of me
But we're never together

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
This time we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You had your chances, all your romances
And now I just don't want you
I know I love you because I hate you
And now I'd rather haunt you
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye

You're so beautiful
What makes you feel exciting?
What wakes you up inside?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say bye bye

Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say goodbye
Bye bye baby bye bye
It's your turn to cry
That's why we have to say goodbye
So say it
I don't wanna keep the bright flame of your ego going
So I'll just stop blowing in the wind
To love you is a sin
Adi√≥s

Uh, this is not a love song
I'd like to hurt you
What excites you? What turns you on?
What makes you feel good?
Does it make you feel good to see me cry?
I think it does
That's why it's time to say goodbye
Bye bye

First time and the last time
You can forget about it, baby
Forget the rules, forget the fools
Forget your fears, forget my tears
You can forget about it, baby
Bye bye baby bye bye
You can forget about it, baby
'Cause it's the first time and the last time
You'll ever see me cry
You f**cked it up2Embed
