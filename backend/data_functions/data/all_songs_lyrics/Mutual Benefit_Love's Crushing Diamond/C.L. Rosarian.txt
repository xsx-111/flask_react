C.L. Rosarian LyricsUnderneath the silver maple tree
The only people there were you and me
And it seems that beauty isn't hard to find
When you're around to ease my troubled mind
You were picking roses by the pond
And you found a careless love to put on
And it seems that beauty can be hard to find
When you try to freeze a moment in your mind
Careless love
Careless love
I didn't want to fall in love with you
But it seems that there is nothing I can do
Careless love
Careless love
And to stay is something that you wouldn't do
So I'm letting go to what I'm holding to
