Strong Swimmer LyricsYou were such
A strong swimmer
And you taught me how
To never fear those tall waves
And you stayed
In those deep waters
Always inviting
To a bed on the bottom
And that current took you away
And it made you pay and pay
When I saw you I didn't know your name
It was such
A long winter
When the ice had thawed
There wasn't much that survived it
It takes more
Than a strong swimmer
To stay above water
With a body divided
And that current took you away
And it made you pay and pay
When I saw you
I didn't know your name
When I see you
They'll give us different names
I clear my mind of joy and sorrow
River doesn't know tomorrow
Rolls along with such simplicity
You told me you had stashed away
A note that would explain the way
You felt if we would ever find you gone
The river only knows to carry on
The river only knows to carry onEmbed
