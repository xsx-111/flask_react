Advanced Falconry Lyrics
And, oh, the way she moves
Always on the run
And to look into her eyes
Will make a fool of anyone

And she talks softly
Sees through me
Says something
I can't hear it
But I won't forget
The way she flies

Oh, to stare into the void
And see a friendly face
And find meaning in a word
In a moment of rare grace


Talk softly
Walk slowly
Take nothing
I can't hear it
But I won't forget
The way she flies1Embed
