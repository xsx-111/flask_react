Golden Wake LyricsAnd in the water I could see
A piece of what you broke in me
I took a walk my usual way
I called to quit my job today
And in these holy, empty hours
When my quiet thoughts get louder
Saying you're born to be this way
You're not meant to be afraid
Sometimes my heart and brain conspire
To set everything on fire
Just to stop the tyranny
Of that minute hand on me
We woke for golden morning hours
Just to soak in all the power
We weren't made to be this way
We weren't made to be afraidEmbed
