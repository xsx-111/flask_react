Doom City Lyrics
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city

I think I'll die
When Doom City air this way comes
He, in Empyrean
Breathes from his mouth and over tongue
Sky will crucify
Tear little holes in my lungs
I think I'll die
When Doom City air this way comes

Doom City
Doom City

Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Do-do-do-doom city, do-do-do-doom city
Spark in firmament
Doom City sky opens up
He disorients
Everyone's lives with his breath
Charged with particles
Doom City air rips me up
Unbelievable
Doom City sky makes him laugh

Doom City
Doom City
Doom City
