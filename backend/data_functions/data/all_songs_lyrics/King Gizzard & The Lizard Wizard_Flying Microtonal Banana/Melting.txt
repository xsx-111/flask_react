Melting Lyrics
Thawing ices
Worse than ISIS
Worse than the most deadly virus
Living harmless is desirous
How can we with absent-mindedness?

The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for our children when our world
Has melted down
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting

Conflagrated and cremated
When the world is consummated
Devastated, populated
World of isolated mortal folk

The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for our children when our world
Has melted down
Melting
Melting, melting, melting


Toxic air is here to scare us
Fatal fumes from melting ferrous
All we discuss is superfluous
If we can't keep our hands to ourselves

The earth is melting down
Our home and our playground
Won't be fit for our children when our world
Has melted down
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, melting
Melting
Melting, melting, meltingEmbed
