Rattlesnake Lyrics
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

Isolation
Trepidation
Don't fear nothing
Snake is bluffing
Whips his tail
Sends you running

Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Vegetation
Aggravation
Found him hiding
Snake is smiling
Whips his tail
Leaves you riling

Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle

Hibernation
Altercation
Don't get angry
Snake is cranky
Whips his tail
In a frenzy
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me

Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end
Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
While you're immobile
Screaming like a maniac after my attack
Crying like a baby child in exile
Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til your death
Rattling 'til your death
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end
Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
When youre immobile
Screaming like a maniac
After my attack
Crying like a baby child
In exile
Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til your death
Rattling 'til your death

Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

Isolation
Trepidation
Don't fear nothing
Snake is bluffing
Whips his tail
Sends you running

Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
Rattlesnake, rattles me
Rattlesnake, rattlesnake
