Billabong Valley Lyrics
Outlaws on the run
Faster than a stolen gun
Tied naked to the trees
Killed so gruesomely
Burning tents to the ground
Cops won't wave 'em down
The most wanted men
Bushrangers reigning in

Bloodthirsty tendencies
Anti-authority
Mad dog Morgan
He never gave a warning
Mad dog Morgan
Shot in the back by morning

Outlaws on the run
Faster than a stolen gun
Tied naked to the trees
Killed so gruesomely
Burning tents to the ground
Cops won't wave 'em down
The most wanted men
Bushrangers reigning in
Bloodthirsty tendencies
Anti-authority
Mad dog Morgan
He never gave a warning
Mad dog Morgan
Shot in the-4Embed
