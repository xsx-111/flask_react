La La Lie Lyrics
Guess what I'm done
Writing you songs
You'll give up your job at the bank
Proving money's not fun when you're gone
So this is the first verse
It's not very long
But I'm ready to move on

Guess what I'm done
Writing your book
The ending got twisted around
But for all the hell that it took
The electrical wires
They hum in the walls
In the room that I rent now without you

I've got friends who (la la lie)
Will help me pull through (la la lie la la la lie)
The spaceman that can't get high
I'm coming back to my girl by July
Yeah yeah yeah

So guess what I'm done
Drawing you pictures
I'm dulling the day with a drink
In a parking garage by the theatre
We met for a movie
Every scene was a sign
We made out through their meaning
I've got friends who (la la lie)
Will help me pull through (la la lie la la la lie)
The spaceman that can't get high
I'm coming back to my girl by July
Yeah yeah yeah

Guess what I'm done
Writing you songs
I'm far too unstable to settle
I doubt that the doctors are wrong
So I'll wait by a palm tree, a palm tree, a palm tree

I've got friends (la la lie)
To help me pull through (la la lie la la la lie)
A spaceman that can't get high
I'm coming back to my girl by July
Yeah yeah yeah
Well I've got friends who (la la lie)
Will help me pull through (la la lie la la la lie)
This song for a long goodbye
I'm coming back
I'm coming back to my girl (la la lie)
Back to my girl (la la lie la la la lie)
This song for a long goodbye
I'm coming back to my girl by July1Embed
