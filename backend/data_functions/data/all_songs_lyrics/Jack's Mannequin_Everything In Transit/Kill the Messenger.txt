Kill the Messenger LyricsOh my God, this hurts like hell
I had that dream again where
I was lost for good in outer space
Tell me, doctor, how to shake
A waking nightmare that is only
Worse when I am sleeping
Kill the messenger
I swear it's not me
It's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And I never told you that
And all I need from you
Could be the thing that
Leaves us both up here forever
I'm gonna send a little rain your way
I'm gonna send a little rain...
It's not so easy, caving in
I walked by your apartment twice today
While you were gone at work
And all the colors got so down
It's not as cold out here
But come quick, I am losing feeling
Kill the messenger
I swear it's not me
It's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And I never told you that
And all I need from you
Could be the thing that
Leaves us both up here forever
I'm gonna send a little rain your way
I'm gonna send a little rain, send a little rain
I'm gonna send a little rain to pour down on you
Rain that makes the flowers bloom
Rain to leave you all alone
That keeps eyelashes falling
And wishes washed away
Kill the messenger
I swear it's not me
It's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And I never told you that
And all I need from you
Could be the thing that
Leaves us both up here forever
I'm gonna send a little rain your way
I'm gonna send a little rain...
I'm gonna send a little rain your wayEmbed
