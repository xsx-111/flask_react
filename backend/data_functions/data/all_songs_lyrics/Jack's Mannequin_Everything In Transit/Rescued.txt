Rescued Lyrics
Two to one
Static to the sound of you and I
Undone for the last time
And there this was
Hiding at the bottom of your
Swimming pool some September
And don't you think
I wish that I could stay
Your lips give you away

I can hear it, a jet engine
Through the center of the storm
And I'm thinking I'd prefer not to be rescued

Two to none
Roads that lead away from this
I'm following myself just this once
And I got spun
It appears you're spun as well
It happens when you pay attention
Or this could take all year

But, when it's quiet does she hear me?
Jettisoned to the center of the storm
And I'm thinking I'd prefer not to be rescued
And oh, I can feel her
She's dying just to keep me cold
I'm finally numb
So please don't get me rescued
Rescued

And it's unclear
But, this may be my last song
Oh, I, I can tell
She's raising hell to give to me
She got me warm
So please don't get me rescued
And oh, say you'll miss me one last time
I'll be strong, whatever you do
Please don't get me rescued

Cause I'm feeling like
I might need to be near you
And I feel alright so please
Don't get me rescued3Embed
