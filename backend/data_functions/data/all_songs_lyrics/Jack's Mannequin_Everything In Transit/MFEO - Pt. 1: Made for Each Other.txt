MFEO - Pt. 1: Made for Each Other Lyrics
I swim across an ocean
It's my matress in the basement
I'm sweatin' out excuses
That would make your stomach turn
The road we drove last night
Stretched from the desert to Las Vegas
We filled our cups, and lit one up
The snow began to burn

Oh, Oh maybe, we were made
We were made for each other
Ahh, is it possible for the
World to look this way forever?
Ahhh, Ahhh...

I talked so much, I'm sure
I didn't realize I'd gone crazy
Didn't catch my bloody nose
Or that my heart tried to explode
I still live with my High School friends
Some people never change at all
We're still the same compulsive drunks
We were when we were small
(Someone get this man to a hospital!)
Ohh, maybe, we were made
We were made for each other
Ahh, is it possible for the
World to look this way forever?
Ahhh, Ahhh...

A long (a long) way from from a firework daze
But I still like to burn, burn, burn
I'm always (I'm always) in the haze of a car crash
The orange airbag dust covers everything
Oh, everything

And maybe, we were made
We were made for each other
Ahh, is it possible for the
World to look this way forever?
Ahhh, Ahhh...Embed
