MFEO - Pt. 2: You Can Breathe Lyrics
You can breathe, you can breathe now
You can breathe, but the air is running out
You can breathe, you can breathe now
You can breathe, but the air is running out on you

You waited for me in the rain
In the parking lot
Cold hands, lips blue
Clothes stuck to you
You could have phoned me for a ride
It's a mess out there
You said the rain's the rain
Some air'd be good for you
You can breathe, you can breathe now
Well good for you
You can breathe, but the air is running out

You get in my car
Where its warm
You cannot forget
Skin new, hands true
My hands all over you
So what's another night
The seats rolled back
We can't see through
The rains the rain
Some air'd be good for you
You can breathe, you can breathe now
You can breathe, but the air is running out
You can breathe, you can breathe now
You can breathe, but the air is running out on you

And you walked for miles down
The shores of California to the
Coast of Mexico where you could hide
And no one'd have to know

You can breathe, you can breathe now
You can breathe, but the air is running out
You can breathe, you can breathe now
You can breathe, but the air is running out on you
On you now
You can breathe, you can breathe now
You can breathe, but the air is running out
You can breathe, you can breathe now
You can breathe, but the air is running out on you
Running out on you

(And Maybe, we were made for each other)
(You can breathe but the air is running out)
(And Maybe, the world'll look like this forever)
(And Maybe, we were made for each other)
(You can breathe but the air is running out)
(And Maybe, the world'll look like this forever)
(And Maybe, we were made for each other)
(And Maybe, we were made for each other)Embed
