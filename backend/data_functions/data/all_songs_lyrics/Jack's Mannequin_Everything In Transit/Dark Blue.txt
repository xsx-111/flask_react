Dark Blue Lyrics
I have, I have you
Breathing down my neck, breathing down my neck
I don't, don't know
What you could possibly expect
Under this condition
So I'll wait, I'll wait
For the ambulance to come, ambulance to come
Pick us up off the floor
What did you possibly expect under this condition

So slow down
This night's a perfect shade of...

Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room
When I'm here with you?
I said the world could be burning, burning down
Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
Well I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning
'Til there's nothing but dark blue
Just dark blue
And this flood, this flood is slowly rising up
Swallowing the ground beneath my feet
Tell me how anybody thinks under this condition
So I'll swim, I'll swim
As the water rises up, sun is sinking down
And now all I can see are the planets in a row
Suggesting it's best that I

Slow down
This night's a perfect shade of...

Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room
When I'm here with you?
I said the world could be burning, burning down
Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
Well I'm here with you
I said the world could be burning
Dark blue

We were boxing, we were boxing the stars
We were boxing (We were boxing)
You were swinging from Mars
And then the water reached the West Coast
And took the power lines (The power lines)
And it was me and you (This could last forever)
And the whole town under water
There was nothing we could do
It was dark blue
Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room
When I'm here with you?
I said the world could be burning, burning down
Dark blue, dark blue
Have you ever been alone in a crowded room?
Well I'm here with you

I said the world could be burning
'Til there's nothing but dark blue
Just dark blue
If you've ever been alone in the dark blue
If you ever been alone, you'll know, you'll know6Embed
