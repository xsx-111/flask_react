Statues LyricsThe way you moved
I can't explain
The mood subsides
And grows again
I've lived alone
I've held a hand
I've tried to care
And understand
What is faith
And when belief
And who knows how
These things deceive
I never said
And though I tried
If I could leave
And sleep tonight
I can't imagine
How this ever came to be
I can't imagine
How this ever came to beEmbed
