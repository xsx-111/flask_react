Enola Gay Lyrics
Enola Gay, you should have stayed at home yesterday
Ah-ha, words can't describe the feeling and the way you lied
These games you play, they're gonna end in more than tears someday
Ah-ha, Enola Gay, it shouldn't ever have to end this way

It's 8:15, and that's the time that it's always been
We got your message on the radio, conditions normal and you're coming home


Enola Gay, is mother proud of little boy today?
Ah-ha, this kiss you give, it's never ever gonna fade away


Enola Gay, it shouldn't ever have to end this way
Ah-ha, Enola Gay, it shouldn't fade our dreams away

It's 8:15, and that's the time that it's always been
We got your message on the radio, conditions normal and you're coming home
Enola Gay, is mother proud of little boy today?
Ah-ha, this kiss you give, it's never ever gonna fade away12Embed
