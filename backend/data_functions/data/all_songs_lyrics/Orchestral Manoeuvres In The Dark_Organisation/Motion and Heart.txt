Motion and Heart LyricsEverything is as it should be
From motion and heart to the scenery
From make do and mend to the new Paris trend
You said that you learnt but it happens again
Oh what's a heart that refuses to beat
Fortunes gained lost on the street
I couldn't believe this would happen again
The things you said and I called you my friend
Each time we tried we failed as before
From laissez faire to the knock on the door
But everything is as it should be
When you give your heart to me
From mo mo mo mo motion and heart
To heart heart heart heart heart and move
From mo mo mo mo motion and heart
To heart heart heart heart heart and moveEmbed
