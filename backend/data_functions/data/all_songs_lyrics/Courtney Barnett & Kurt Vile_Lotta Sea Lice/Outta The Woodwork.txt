Outta The Woodwork LyricsI was busy underwater
Trying hard to hold my breath
A drowning spider caught my eye and I
Had to come up for air
Just because you’re older than me
Doesn’t mean you have to be so condescending
I still see the same things that you see
I’m a little shady on my history
I am normally pretty forgiving but only if you are
She’s so easy
I noticed you stopped talking to me
Now you’re talking to me all the time
Do you know you’re no good at listening?
But you’re really good at saying everything on your mind
It must be tiring trying so hard
To look like you’re not really trying at all
I guess if you’re afraid of aiming too high
Then you’re not really gonna have too far to fall
I am normally pretty forgiving but only if you are
She’s so easy
Climb aboard the wagon when it comes on through
Jump up on your horse and tell me how’s the view
Look over my shoulder when I talk to you
Where’s the more important person in the room?
She’s so easyEmbed
