Untogether LyricsI was friendly with this girl
Who insisted on touching my face
She told outrageous stories
I believed them 'til the endings were changing from endings before
She's not touching me anymore
Untogether
I couldn't help it, I got hard
You can try your life
But you can't save the unsaveably
Untogether
I was shipwrecked with this frog
Who was endlessly testing my faith
He made outrageous demangs
I ignored him 'til I strapped on my boat feet and surfed into shore
He's not touching me anymore
Untogether
I couldn't help it, it got hard
You can try your life
But you can't change the unchangeably
Untogether
Now the bird nest on my back
Keeps my turning and straining to see
We threw outrageous parties
We were golden
Now the bird keeps a distance and I keep my speed
Sometimes there's no poison like a dream
Untogether
I couldn't help it, it got hard
You can dry your eyes
But you can't hold the impossibly
