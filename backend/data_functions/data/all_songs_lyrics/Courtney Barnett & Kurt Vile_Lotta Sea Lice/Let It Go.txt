Let It Go Lyrics

One, two, three, four

What time do you usually wake up?
(Depends on what time I sleep)
Technicolour rainbow horror
((Sweet dreams))

Keep on rolling on the impulse
(Ignore backstage lethargy)
All those obligations lost in
((Reverie))

You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over

Eastern standard open G
(Transpacific malady and)
Calm is more conducive to ((the
Remedy))
Speckled sunlight on my freckles
(Salty water curls my hair)
Run the race at your own pace
((You'll get there))

What comes first - the chorus or the verse?
(I'm a bit blocked at the moment)
They say the more you learn the less that
((You know))

You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over

((You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over
You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over
You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over
You've gotta let it go
Before it takes you over))Embed
