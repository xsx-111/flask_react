On Script LyricsOn script every night
Like a well-rehearsed stage show
Wet your lips, it won't take long
To break this old behavior
Wings clipped, no need to fly
What, do you think that you're special?
No reflex, it's just a bend of the elbow
I know it's getting old
Nondescript, every night
Like a well-versed get well card
Barely dressed, and I just might
Take you up on your offer, yeah1Embed
