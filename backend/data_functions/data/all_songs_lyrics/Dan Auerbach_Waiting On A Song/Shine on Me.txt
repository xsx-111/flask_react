Shine on Me Lyrics
You only got a couple miles to go
If you're tryin' to drive me insane
I saw you crack a smile about a week ago
In the middle of the pourin' rain

I climbed the cliffs of Dover
To go dry out in the sun
I'm like a four leaf clover
'Cause I hide from everyone

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me

When I get up I gotta get me a plan
To do whatever I can I suppose
I'm already working for my Uncle Sam
You know he's got me countin' Cheerios

No  crying on my shoulder
I'm allergic to the tears
It's trying for this soldier
To pretend for all these years
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me

I gotta keep my Ray-Bans on
So my eyes won't burn
While they shed new light upon
My number one concern

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me

Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me
Shine on me5Embed
