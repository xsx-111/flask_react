Undertow LyricsThe games we play
The tales we spin
It's always the way
Original sin

Would you dive for me
In the icy sea
Pry me free from this life I lead
Undertow, sad old memories from so long ago
Here they come to drag me down below
Here it comes, the undertow
Solider of fortune, or broke down dog
Sign of the scorpion, or a hollow log

Would you dive for me
In the icy sea
Pry me free from this life I lead
Undertow, sad old memories from so long ago
Here they come to drag me down below
Here it comes, the undertow
Undertow, sad old memories from so long
Here they come to drag me down below
Here it comes, the undertow1Embed
