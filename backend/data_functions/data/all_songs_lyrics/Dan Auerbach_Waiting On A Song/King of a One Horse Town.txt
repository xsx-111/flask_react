King of a One Horse Town Lyrics
Everyday is just a little white lie
Telling myself I'm gettin' by
I just stay in this room and cry
The snow it covers up the ground
And I can't hear a single sound

I'd turn off the TV and go for a drive
But I can't see there's any signs of life
Exept this Christmas tree with blinking lights
I coulda made it but I messed around
I'm a loser with a rusty crown
Scared if I jump in the ocean I might drown

King of a One Horse Town
I'm the King of a One Horse Town
And I barely pull my weight around

I thought about leaving but I don't know
Wouldn't even know anywhere to go
Guess I'll stay on desolation row
Go get stoned and hang around
The beat of my drum is the only sound
I'd jump into the ocean but I'm scared I'd drown
King of a One Horse Town
I'm a King of a One Horse Town
I'm a King of a One Horse Town
And I barely pull my weight around

I'm a King of a One Horse Town
King of a One Horse Town
I'm a King of a One Horse Town
And I barely pull my weight aroundEmbed
