Malibu Man LyricsI moved from New York, with my boogie board
And bought a big house on the ocean
Stopped eating meat, I took the shoes off my feet
Just because I took the notion
My hair gave in so my beard came out
Caused quite a facial commotion
It grew past my lips and then it covered my mouth
So no one could read my emotions

Malibu Man, Isn't life grand
He's got the world in his hands, Malibu Man
Sometimes I get up but I'm feeling down
I don't have a sister or brother
No family, no wife but I'm still living the life
Just step from one stone to the other
I'm a myth of man; I ride the waves when I can
I make the music so people will buy it
I take pride in my ways, and my colossal paydays
I'm just an old-fashion retailers' riot

Malibu Man, Isn't life grand
He's got the world in his hands, Malibu Man
Give it up...1Embed
