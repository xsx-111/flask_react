Stand by My Girl Lyrics
There's a man in a blue plaid shirt come knockin'
I don't know what he's come here for
But I know it probably isn't gonna hurt anybody
If I don't get up and answer the door
No, I believe I'll stay here on the floor

I'm gonna stand by my girl, don't think I won't
I'm gonna stand by my girl, because she'll kill me if I don't
I said she'll kill me if I don't

I never shoulda messed up
I shoulda gone ahead and fessed up
I'm gonna look good all dressed up
For my own funeral
I'm sure she'll look beautiful

I'm gonna stand by my girl, don't think I won't
I'm gonna stand by my girl, because she'll kill me if I don't
I said she'll kill me if I don't

I love my girl with fire in her eyes
That's what I used to say
But now I've come to realize
If I wanna live another day
I can't be livin' that way
I'm gonna stand by my girl, don't think I won't
I'm gonna stand by my girl, because she'll kill me if I don't
I'm gonna stand by my girl, don't think I won't
I'm gonna stand by my girl, because she'll kill me if I don't
I said she'll kill me if I don'tEmbed
