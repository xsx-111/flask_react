Cherrybomb LyricsWant to find me a flame who wants to burn with me
Not a cherrybomb who wants to turn on me
She's sweeter than an apple pie
But she doesn't care enough to try

Cherry
Cherrybomb
Cherry
Cherrybomb
Took a job at the mill so I could earn for it
Make her pretty, all the heads are gonna turn for her
But as soon as the money went away
My cherry blew up right in my face

Cherry
Cherrybomb
Cherry
Cherrybomb
So if you ever go' climbing in a cherry tree
Remember what old cherry she done to me
I thought our love was strong
But her fuse just wasn't that long
Cherry
Cherrybomb
