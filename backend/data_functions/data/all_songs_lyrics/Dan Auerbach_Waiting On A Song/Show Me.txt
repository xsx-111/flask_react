Show Me LyricsThere's nothing you can say that I haven't heard
'Cause walkin' still speaks louder than words
So all this talking's been a lot of fun
But if we really wanna get it done
Don't you act so fancy free
Girl come on and show me
I took a little drive out into the country
I'm feeling half alive, does she really want me
I'm 20 miles outta Tupelo
And I don't really wanna let her go
But I can't play make believe
The girl's gotta show me
A heart is not a toy that anyone should play with
I wanna be a man that you want to stay with
If it's yes, you gotta let me know
If it's no please let me go
I got this heart here on my sleeve
Girl come on and show meEmbed
