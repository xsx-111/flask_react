I Can Hardly Spell My Name LyricsTeardrops from a shadow
This tongue starts to waggle
That's a lovely dress yo'
And oh that's just "titian"
And it's not true you know you swear
And all by yourself
As time delivers for a while now
This may not appeal to you
But i can hardly spell my name
A siamese is lonely also
And i've been waiting all my life
In spite of this arrangement
Moderation on vacation
It's time we all settled downEmbed
