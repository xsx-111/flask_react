Caterpillar LyricsI have walked your sorry streets
Lived amongst your people
And I'm sure we must have heard
The same birds singing
You have stepped in hardened footprints
Up where my shoes were muddied
And I know we must have heard
The same dogs barking
When the ground was rumbling
And the bathroom walls were bending
I lay there wet and naked
Oh I know your heard me yelling
Out a name that you never used for me, till then
Out a name that you never used for me, till then
Out a name that you never used
I have shat on the hillside
Neck deep in cushioned clover
Up where I'm sure you braided
Those necklaces and bracelets
You have lost your socks and panties
Out by the caterpillar
That grades the road I walk on
While I'm dreading English
When the ground was shaking
And the jewel tea was a falling
There's a cracking in your kitchen
Oh I know you heard me calling
Out a name that I never used for you, till then
Out a name that I never used for you, till then
Out a name that I never usedEmbed
