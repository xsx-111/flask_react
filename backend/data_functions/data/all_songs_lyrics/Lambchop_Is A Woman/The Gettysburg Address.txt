The Gettysburg Address LyricsWe hold these truths to be self-evident
We drink beer in bars and act irreverent
The stockings were hung by the window with care
Right next to her shoes and her underwear
You might look at this place and call it a mess
The tray is full of ashes and their sweet caress
And the pain that's the same
And the pain that's the same
My Gettysburg address
And the pain that's the same
And the pain that's the same
In my Gettysburg address
Loose papers and bottles and other things can be found
An assortment of crap that you put on the ground
Glasses lie on the notebook right next to my pen
Why am I thinking these thoughts again?
As I sit in this chair I'm in need of a rest
After doing the worst at being the best
And for the time being
And for the time being
My Gettysburg address
And for the time being
And for the time being
In my Gettysburg address
I cough up some phlegm and I wipe my nose
And I pick up a few of yesterday's clothes
I carry the garbage on out to the back
Is it Monday or Tuesday? I always lose track
Why did she never happen I begin to regress
Why does this one mean more?
Why does that one mean less?
If all men are equal
If all men are equal
My gettysburg address
And if all men are equal
If all men are equal
My Gettysburg address
And if all men are equal
If all men are equal...Embed
