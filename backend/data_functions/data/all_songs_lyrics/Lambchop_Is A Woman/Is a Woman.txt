Is a Woman LyricsIn the hour of the girl
You can make this danger witness
Or whatever, without your heart
You can wish you could relate
If it's always gonna be
Sit beside me on a star
If you wake me up tonight
So you try to make it whole
With everybody here
More than a sony
To make the words throw up
Or show me the way
As they pick me up again
They will be there on the couch
They will make you better still
(Can you be sure?)
Of anything you make
Maybe you can get a whiff
It's enough to make you gag
It's enough to make you sick
Each and every day
With the concrete and the masonry
When the paint that's on is dry
You can work it from your eye
And you take it from my heart
As you stand alone forever
From the roaming and the surf
And the cloudy cloudy day
Just a boss thing that is pure
Something specially for you
It's like everybody's needing it
And everybody's sure
(And if they say)
Is a woman, write this down
Put the paper over there
More than it is
No more than it is
Is a woman, write this down
Put the paper over there
More than it is
No more than it is
Is a woman, write this down
Put the paper over there
More than it is
No more than it is
No more than it is
Is a woman, write this down
Put the paper over there
More than it is
No more than it isEmbed
