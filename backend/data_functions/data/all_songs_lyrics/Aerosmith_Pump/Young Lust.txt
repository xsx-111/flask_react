Young Lust Lyrics
Yeeeeaaaaahhh
Young lust
Happy just to be in lust
Never have to eat no dust
Everybody talking about
Young lust
You're dying and you're screaming inside
Oh, you're guilty way before you've been tried
And it's crazy, but you're digging it
Oooh
Young lust
You feel it in the summertime blues
Oh, it's easy when there's nothing to lose
And baby, you'll be missing out
Young lust
Sometimes you need it so bad
It's enough to drive a young girl mad
And so what you gonna do about it?
Yeah, yeah, a little bit of nasty
You look a little sleazy
But don't get any on you
Young lust
You better keep your daughter inside
Or she's going to get a dose of my pride
Yeah, everybody talks about it
Young lust
Once you had it you can never go back
Don't you ever let em give you any no slack
When you're streaking down the alley way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Checking out the ladies who didn't bring their boyfriends
Who love to get in trouble
I got to say, I'll see you later
Meet me in the elevator
Always gettin' stronger
Never gettin' weaker
My love is gettin' longer
I keep it in my sneaker
Never keep a secret
Never feelin' guilty
Oh, never gettin' lonely
Never gettin' no peace
Hidin' from the police

Sneakin' out the back way
Sneakin' down the alley way
Got to do it my way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do it in the sunshine
Hanging from the clothes line
Find another tree to climb
Young lust, there's no time for lovin'
Young lust, uh, don't leave it in the oven
Young lust, I'm pushing and shoving it
Yeah
Young lust
Come on now I just can't wait
Are you fishin' or you gonna cut bait
Everybody's doing it
Yeah
Young lust
Honey, now ain't it a bitch
Sometimes you got to scratch that itch
So what you gonna do about it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
