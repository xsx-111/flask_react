Hoodoo/Voodoo Medicine Man Lyrics
Sired by a shaman, I was left as a child
Dragged from the cradle, I was weaned in the wild
Ran with the wolfpack, flesh torn to shreds
In the compensations, I was left there for dead

Read it in the paper, it ain't fair
You-know-who today don't seem to care
Living, loving, getting loose
Masturbating with a noose
Now someone's kicking out the chair
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Some kind of Voodoo
Come across this land
Some kind of Voodoo
We need a medicine man

Everybody's lookin' at the sky
I don't believe the cover ups and lies, yeah
They've been telling us since birth
Pissing off old Mother Earth
My gones are by-gones prophesized
Come on

Some kind of Voodoo
Come across this land
Some kind of hoodoo
We need a medicine man
Yeah oooh oohoo
Get ready!
Huh Huh!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Wonder should I go or should I stay
'Cause what we got ain't working any way
I did my best, God knows I've tried
I feel like I've been crucified
Why did you, why did you
Why did you take it all away?
