Monkey on My Back Lyrics
(Woe is me, and I've been dyin'
Got to get that monkey off my back)
Yoooowwwwwww

The fortune teller looked into my eyeballs
The wrinkles on her face about to crack
She said, "You best believe it
You ain't goin' anywhere
Unless you get that monkey off your back"
 whoo hoo yeah
Well, I made believe the devil made me do it
I was the evil leader of the pack
You best believe I had it all, and then I blew it
Feedin' that fucking monkey on my back
Yow!
If you put it a spoon, man, I would boot it
Some king whose mental house was just a shack
Where do you draw the line when all your friends are dyin'?
You got to get that monkey off your back
Uh, uh, uh
Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon
She said, "Now, bring me home his head inside a sack"
But now you find your crystal balls are dragging
Uh, uh, uh, got to get that monkey off your back
  Yeah, yea hooEmbed
