My Girl Lyrics
My girl, she breathes hellfire
And my girl, she feeds my desire
My girl Sadie, she's the wind in my sails
A puss-in-boots lady with a cat-of-nine tails
Coming after you, honey - feet, don't fail me now

My girl, she's bareback rider
And my girl, she's Lady Godiva
She a full-time lover, no mon ami
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh my

Slipping in and out of love
Slipping in and out of love
Slipping in and out of love
Slipping in and out of love

My girl, she smokes barbed wire
And my girl can't get no higher
I made it with the lady with a one-track mind
Diamonds in the rough, they're so hard to find
Day after day it's the same old grind
And grind and grind and grind
And grind and grind and grind

My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl
My girl, my girl, my girl

My girl, she's bareback rider
And my girl, she's Lady Godiva
She a full-time lover, no mon ami
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh my

Slipping in and out of love
Slipping in and out of love
Slipping in and out of love
Slipping in and out of love

Oh, my girlEmbed
