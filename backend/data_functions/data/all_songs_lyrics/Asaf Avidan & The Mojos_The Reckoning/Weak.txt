Weak LyricsSpeak, Baby speak
Tell me I'm weak
Tell me these promises are not mine to keep
Tell me I'm ugly
But tell me you love me
Tell me you cannot go through this world without me
Oh I'm, I'm just a tree
My roots
Are with her
But my leaves are falling
Heal, baby heal
Take all the time you will
I never thought I'd say this but I'm letting go of the bill
I don't wanna see
Your face here no more
Still that doesn't mean that I'm shutting the door
Oh I'm, I'm just a tree
My leaves are with her
But my roots are very well deep
Speak, Baby speak
Tell me I'm weak
Tell me these promises are not mine to keep
Tell me I'm ugly
But tell me you love me
Tell me you cannot go through this world without me
Oh I'm, I'm just a tree
My roots
Are with her
But my leaves are falling
I know these words are tearing you apart
Still I told you, right from the start
This is how our little song
Is gonna play outEmbed
