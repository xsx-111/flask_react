One Day / Reckoning Song (Wankelmut Remix Radio Edit) Lyrics
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
(One day)
(One day)

No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why
No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why
No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why
No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be one
(One Day)
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be one
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have toldEmbed
