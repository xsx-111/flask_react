Her Lies LyricsShe said "baby, get down on your knees"
I said "babe if you insist"
She said "why do you keep seeing things you know that don't exist"
I said "baby, I love you, now what can I do
I'll probably love you till the day I die"
She said "well pretty honey, if that's true than give me both them, pretty eyes"
I said "baby, you can have them - you can have my eyes"
See I was thinking if she took them I won't see her lies
But my baby – I can taste her lies
She said "baby, get into this sack"
I said "baby, I don't know what's there"
She said "all I want to do with you
Is take you with me everywhere"
I said "okay, baby take me everywhere
Take me through the day, through the night"
She said "oh silly babe, don't you kid with me
You know I really don't have the time"
Still I said "baby, you can take me" – and I got right in
See, I was thinking if she took me, I could taste her skin
But my baby, all I taste is her lies
Oh my baby, all I taste is her lies
Oh my honey, all I taste is her lies
I said "baby, you can have them - you can have my eyes"
See I was thinking if she took them I won't see her lies
But my baby – I can taste her lies
Oh my baby
Oh my honey
Oh my baby
Oh my baby
I can taste…
