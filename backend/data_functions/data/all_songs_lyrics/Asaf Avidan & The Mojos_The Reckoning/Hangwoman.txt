Hangwoman LyricsHangwoman, hangwoman
Sleeping in my bed
Got me a hangwoman
Hanging round my bed
Lord I dunno but, I think she wants me dead
Hangwoman, hangwoman
Got me wearing my best clothes
I said this little hangwoman
Got me wearing my best clothes
But if it's for a wedding or a funeral, only she knows
Said if it's a wedding or a funeral, only god knows
You can't stop a fly flying
You can't stop a flood from flooding
You can't stop, a man from lying
You can't stop this girl from tying
Hangwoman, hangwoman
Tie that noose around my neck
Hangwoman, hangwoman
Tie that noose around my neck
Hangwoman, tie that noose, so our love would never breakEmbed
