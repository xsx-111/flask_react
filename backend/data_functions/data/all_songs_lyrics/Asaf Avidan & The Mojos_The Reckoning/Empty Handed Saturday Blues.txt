Empty Handed Saturday Blues LyricsBaby, I've got some news
You ain't gonna like
Baby I've gone and made you my muse
Believe me, I wasn't even trying
Now, I've got you on the run again
Now I've got you leaving on your train
Now I've got nothing in my hand
Now I've got you on the run again
Babe, you've got me on the ropes
Babe, you've got me, only god knows
Disappearing with no cause
Now, I've got you on the run again
Now I've got you leaving on your train
Now I've got nothing in my hand
Now I've got you on the run againEmbed
