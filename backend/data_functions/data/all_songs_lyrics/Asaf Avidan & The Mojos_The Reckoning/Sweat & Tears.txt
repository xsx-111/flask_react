Sweat & Tears LyricsGlue me back, I'm fallen and broken on the floor
My small ceramic pieces are bleeding like the shore
My head says "no" and my body says "go"
My heart says "I don't know, just flow"
And I am left there, standing, dressed in my best smile
And you don't say a word, instead we wait a while
You know how it goes from here
Two sets of skin and lots of sweat and tears
Sweat and tears
Suddenly your tired hand is resting on my knee
And I can feel your warmth and I can't wait to be
Clinging to your lower lip with my bare teeth
Clinging to your love with my lost belief
You know how it goes from here
Two sets of skin and lots of sweat and tears
Sweat and tears
Sweat and tears
Sweat and tears
Sweat and tears
Sweat and tears
Sweat and tears
Ain't it fun when you, ain't alone no more
Ain't it fun when, someone tickles your core
We're two vacant shells, entangled in each other in the dark
We're two vacant shells, imprisoning each other in the darkEmbed
