A Ghost Before the Wall LyricsShe had them big thick lips, like pillows underneath her cheeks
When she spoke, an avalanche rolled on them from behind her teeth
Suddenly, the carpet, was pulled from underneath my feet
When I tried to get close, she just laughed and got beneath the sheets
She said "No, no, no – I got to prove you wrong"
She said "No, no, no – I got to prove you wrong"
She had them big almond eyes, that gave her away
And when she started them you could see the tornadoes play
I had the kind of empty hole, that always made her pay
She had them dancing shoes that never let her stay
She said "No, no, no – I got to prove you wrong"
She said "No, no, no, no, no no – I got to prove you wrong"
She said "No, no, no, no, no no – I got to prove you wrong"
She said "No, no, no – I got to prove you wrong"
Suddenly she says – "Here I am, coming back like a ghost before the wall"
