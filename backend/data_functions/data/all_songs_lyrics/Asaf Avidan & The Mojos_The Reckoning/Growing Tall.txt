Growing Tall LyricsI've grown up the last three months more than you can believe
And I won't let your tired thoughts bring me back home from sea
I won't let you take this monkey off his tree
And I won't let you roll your coaster - over me
Cause I'm growing
I'm growing tall this fall
Used to be a time when we were high just like them trees
Now the season's changed and we are falling with the leaves
Now you are a vine and you are hanging round my knees
Now you are a vine and you are begging "Honey, please"
But I'm growing
I'm growing tall this fall
I've grown up the last three months more than you can believe
And I won't let your tired thoughts bring me back home from sea
I won't let you take this monkey off his tree
And I won't let you roll your coaster - over me
But I'm growingEmbed
