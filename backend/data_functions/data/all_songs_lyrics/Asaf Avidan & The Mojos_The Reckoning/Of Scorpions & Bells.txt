Of Scorpions & Bells LyricsI know, that my grip was a little too tight
But from where I was coming, you were the only thing right
I guess, I´m sorry for that
But if you think this bars of love you have forged
Will keep me here locked up, and waiting, and yours
Baby, you´re wrong
Baby, I´m leaving
Now decide what you need, a guide or a thief
Someone to hold you, or sharpen your teeth
I ain´t stand to find out
´Cause I think you´re blind, and I think you´re deaf
And touching is the only sense you got left
Well, good luck with that
Baby, I´m leavingEmbed
