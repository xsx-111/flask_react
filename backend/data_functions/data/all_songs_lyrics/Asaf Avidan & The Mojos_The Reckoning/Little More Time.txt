Little More Time LyricsHe met her on the road
With a heavy, heavy load
She said "Oh my lord, you're beautiful"
Now it's hard to do the pushin'
When you're a needle, and she's a cushion
You know, there ain't gonna be too much mushin' that way
He said, she's just one more sheep
In a whole big white heap
All they are is cotton for him to sleep on
Why do we have to die?
Give me just more time
I'm gonna make it all right
All he had left in him was his pain
She was a sweet field of sugar cane
He was a walking hurricane
Use your imagination
He scratches his nails in the dirt
Still he couldn't undo all the hurt
It clang like sweat, onto his shirt
You know how it does
You can't teach a new dog old tricks
You can break but you cannot fix
You cannot, cause it, it really sticks to you
Why do we have to die?
Give me just more time
I'm gonna make it all right
(We're gonna take it up one notch)
Little more time, a little more time
Little more time, a little more time
Little more time, a little more time
A Little more time, a little more time
All I need is time to get home to you (X4)
Time
To get home to you (X4)Embed
