Mirror Image Lyrics
She is my mirror image
Showing me who I am
Until the day that we shatter
She helps me understand
She is my mirror image (Is my mirror image)
Showing me who I am (Showing me who I am)
Until the day that we shatter
I will know where I stand
Heaven can't save this man
Heaven can't help this man
Heaven, Heaven turns his back on this man
Heaven shuts the door on this manEmbed
