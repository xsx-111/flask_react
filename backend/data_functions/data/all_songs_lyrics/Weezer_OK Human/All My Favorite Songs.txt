All My Favorite Songs Lyrics
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite people make me mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I love parties, but I don't go
Then I feel bad when I stay home
'Cause I need a friend when I take a walk
I like spacin' out when somebody talks
I wanna be rich, but I feel guilty
I fall in love with everyone who hates me

All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite people make me mad, so mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Dreamy morning
Walkin' alone by myself
Thinkin' about life
And tryin' to find my way through hell
Sometimes I wish
I was on an island
But then I'd miss
The sound of sirens
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
All my favorite people make me mad, so mad
Everything that feels so good is bad, bad, bad
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me
I don't know what's wrong with me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh4Embed
