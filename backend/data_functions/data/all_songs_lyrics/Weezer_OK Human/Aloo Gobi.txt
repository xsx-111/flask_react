Aloo Gobi Lyrics
What's playin' at The Aero? Some French noir flick
Don't wanna sit next to humans, I'm agoraphobic
Order up a decaf latte, spin Gainsbourg tunes
Gosh darn this cast iron lounger, my butt will bruise

I'd rather be a man on a mission

Oh-oh-oh my God, what's happenin' to me?
Walkin' down Montana, whoa-oh-oh
Same old dull routines, same aloo gobi
Walkin' down Montana, oh-oh-oh

I tried to raise an eyebrow, it weighed too much
Instead, I simply stared at the passing trucks
They said that life gets sweet as years go by
But mine has lost its flavor like this chai

I'd rather be a man on a mission

Oh-oh-oh my God, what's happenin' to me?
Walkin' down Montana, whoa-oh-oh
Same old dull routines, same aloo gobi
Walkin' down Montana, oh-oh-oh
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

You are not alone
You are not alone
Someone else will be there with you, be there with you
You are not alone
Be there with you, be there with you
You are not alone

Oh-oh-oh my God, what's happenin' to me? (What's happenin' to me?)
Walkin' down Montana, oh-oh-oh
Same old dull routines, same aloo gobi
Walkin' down Montana, whoa-oh-oh4Embed
