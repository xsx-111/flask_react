Screens Lyrics
Young girl, lyin' flat in her bed
Streaming images to her head
Homework or memes, slime or BLACKPINK
Eight hours gone, now her mind's blown
She don't, she don't want me here

Now the real world is dying
As everybody moves into the cloud
Can you tell me where we're going?
Where will we be twenty-one years from now?
Everyone stares at their screens
Everyone starеs at their screens

Old maid in the cottage nеxt door
We don't see her much anymore
She plays Solitaire on her desktop
Searches for her kids, now she can't stop
Did she think she'd go out this way?

Now the real world is dying
As everybody moves into the cloud
Can you tell me where we're going?
Where will we be twenty-one years from now?
Everyone stares at their screens (Everyone stares)
Everyone stares at their screens (Everyone stares)
I miss my friends (Everyone stares)
I miss my family (Everyone stares)Embed
