La Brea Tar Pits Lyrics
I was tromping the jungles, there was nothing to find
No mastodon so that I could be the guy that provides
With empty hands, I headed on home
Live long enough, you're gonna choke on a bone, hey, hey
Hey, hey
That's just the way that it goes

Now I'm sinking in the La Brea Tar Pits
And I don't want to die 'cause there's still so much to give
I'm sinking, could you give me a lift?
Wanna make an escape but don't know where to begin

Each time I wriggle, I sink a little deeper, ah, damn
So let me try to persuade you all to lend me a hand
Good with a spear and settling fights
Do anything for the good of the tribe, hey, hey
Could you throw me a rope?
(Throw me a rope)

'Cause I'm sinking in the La Brea Tar Pits
And I don't want to die 'cause there's still so much to give
I'm sinking, could you give me a lift?
Wanna make an escape but don't know where to begin
