Here Comes the Rain Lyrics
Drops of water
Flood cascading from the sky
And it streaks my windshield
Woah-oh, woah-oh, the thunder roars
I open up the door

My umbrella
Makes me look just like the Morton Girl
Splish, splish-splash
Woah-oh, woah-oh, taking a bath
Walking down the road

Here comes the rain
Oh, it's gonna wash all my troubles away
Here comes the rain
Oh, it's gonna wash all my troubles away

I got dirty
Just another punk that bit the dust
In the mirror
I could not recognize myself
The person I'd become
But here comes the rain
Oh, it's gonna wash all my troubles away
Here comes the rain
Oh, it's gonna wash all my troubles away

We're on the way to paradise
Did you hear the news?
The universe will give you more
Of what you pay attention to

Oh, it's gonna wash all my troubles away
Here comes the rain
Oh, it's gonna wash all my troubles away
Wash all my troubles away
Oh, it's gonna wash all my troubles away3Embed
