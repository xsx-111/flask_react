Dead Roses Lyrics
Turn the key
And step into the blackness
Lamplight falls
And casts a laughing phantom
I imagine your smile
And the life that we could share
But with the last of my steps
I see the truth lying there

Dead roses
At the bottom of an oubliette
Where they beat you 'til you begged to live
You are mine and you were always mine
Now I'm crying over dead roses
I could never let them go

A winged beast
With horns upon his cranium
Slinks away
And grinning, mak–µs his way up
I grasp the pieces of rose
And your raven locks of hair
I hear the turn of the key
As I hiss my final prayer
Dead roses
At the bottom of an oubliette
Where they beat you 'til you begged to live
You are mine and you were always mine
Now I'm crying over dead roses
I could never let them goEmbed
