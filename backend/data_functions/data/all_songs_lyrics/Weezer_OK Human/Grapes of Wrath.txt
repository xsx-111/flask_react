Grapes of Wrath Lyrics
I can feel my breathing, it's so nice
It's like a blanket on my life
Let me stay here for forever
In this state of classical denial
Cranking Mrs. Dalloway
Moby Dick, trip on a whale
He's kinda just like me
We're thirsty for the deep

I'm gonna rock my Audible
Headphone, Grapes of Wrath
Drift off to oblivion
I just don't care, I just don't care
Rock my Audible
Headphone, Grapes of Wrath
Drift off to oblivion
You think I care, I just don't care

I just don't care
I'm barely there
I just don't care

Count on me to show support for
Winston Smith in 1984
'Cause battling Big Brother feels more
Meaningful than binging zombie hordes
Take me up to Neverland
Hanging with Yossarian (Yossarian)
He's kinda just like me
We fight 'til we get free
I'm gonna rock my Audible
Headphone, Grapes of Wrath
Drift off to oblivion
I just don't care, I just don't care
Rock my Audible
Headphone, Grapes of Wrath
Drift off to oblivion
You think I care, I just don't care

I just don't care
I'm barely there
I just don't care

Open ear and open mind
I can see without my eyes
Frodo jonesing for the ring
Soon I'll be there smiling
Smiling in my dreams

I'm gonna rock my Audible
Headphone, Grapes of Wrath
Drift off to oblivion
I just don't care, I just don't care
Rock my Audible
Headphone, Grapes of Wrath
Drift off to oblivion
You think I care, I just don't care
I just don't care
I'm barely there
I just don't care5Embed
