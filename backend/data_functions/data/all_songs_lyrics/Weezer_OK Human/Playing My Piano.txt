Playing My Piano Lyrics
My wife is upstairs, my kids are upstairs
And I haven't washed my hair in three weeks
I should get back to these Zoom interviews
But I get so absorbed and time flies
I just can't let go

When I'm playin' my piano
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'm playin' my piano
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm pounding out the bass, singin' out the tune
I never see the sun like I'm livin' in a womb
I'm playin' my piano, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh

A cup of java at the edge of the keys
Dipping down from major to mixolydian
Put on some white noise, double-bolt the door
Kim Jong-un could blow up my city, I'd never know
I just can't let go

When I'm playin' my piano
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, I'm playin' my piano
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm pounding out the bass, singin' out the tune
I never see the sun like I'm livin' in a womb
I'm playin' my piano, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, ohEmbed
