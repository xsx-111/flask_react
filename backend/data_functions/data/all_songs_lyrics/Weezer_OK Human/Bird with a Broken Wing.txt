Bird with a Broken Wing Lyrics
Long ago, I was flyin' in the air
Lookin' at the sea below, I was huntin' krill
Divin' down, in a flash, I'd scoop 'em up
Thrashin' in my mandible, it was such a thrill

Me, my friends, we were killers

Now I'm just a bird with a broken wing
And I still have a song to sing
Turning night to day, warbling clouds away
I'm just a bird with a broken wing
And this beautiful song to sing
Don't feel sad for me, I'm right where I wanna be

The stupid cat, always sneakin' up on me
Thinkin' I would be his meal, 'til I slipped up and away
Singing out, the melody came endlessly
High or low, I felt so free, I had somethin' to say

But he'll never catch my melody
Though I'm just a bird with a broken wing
And I still have a song to sing
Turning night to day, warbling clouds away
I'm just a bird with a broken wing
And this beautiful song to sing
Don't feel sad for me, I'm right where I wanna be

Nothin' matters in the world and everyone is free
But I'll belong to you if you believe in me
Nothin' matters in the world and everyone is free
But I'll belong to you if you believe in me

I'm just a bird with a broken wing
And I still have a song to sing
Turning night to day, warbling clouds away
I'm just a bird with a broken wing
And this beautiful song to sing
Don't feel sad for me, I'm right where I wanna be1Embed
