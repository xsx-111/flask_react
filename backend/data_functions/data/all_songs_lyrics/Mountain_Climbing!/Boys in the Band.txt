Boys in the Band LyricsFreight train
Why am I, I'm arriving late tonight
And the world is turning
Round and round the sun
All the places spinning by and by one by one
Coming home, I'm on time
Been gone such a long time
Goodbye traveling
So long to the boys in the band
Goodbye traveling
So long to the boys in the band
We play tunes today
Leaving memory of yesterday
All the circles widen getting in the sun
All the seasons spinning all the days one by one
Comin' back before long
Comin' back till I'm gone
Goodbye travelling
So long to the boys in the band
Goodbye travelling
So long to the boys in the bandEmbed
