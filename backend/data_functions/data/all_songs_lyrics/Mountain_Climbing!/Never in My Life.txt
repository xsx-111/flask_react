Never in My Life LyricsNever in my life
Could I find a girl like you
Never in my life
Could I find a girl like you
When I wake up in the morning
You make me feel so good
Bringing me the cider whisky
And a little bit of lovin', too
For the first time in my life
I finally found someone like you
For the first time in my life
I finally found someone like you
I feel like a bolt of lightning
But it feels so good
Knowin' my baby's waitin'
And I love her, yes I do
Hey hey hey
Never in my life
Could I find a girl like you
Never in my life
Could I find a girl like you
When I turned around to wake her
About the way she moves
I don't want to leave her
But I wanta love you too1Embed
