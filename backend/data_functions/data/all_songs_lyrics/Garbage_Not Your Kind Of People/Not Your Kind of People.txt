Not Your Kind of People Lyrics
We are not your kind of people
You seem kind of phony
Everything's a lie
We are not your kind of people
Something in your make-up
Don't see eye to eye

We are not your kind of people
Don't want to be like you ever in our lives
We are not your kind of people
We find when you start talking
There's nothing but white noise

Running around tryin' to fit in and wanting to be loved
It doesn't take much
For someone to shut you down
When you built a shell, built an army in your mind
You can't sit still and you don't like hanging around the crowd
They don't understand

You dropped by as I was sleeping
You came to see the whole commotion
And when I woke I started laughing
The joke's on me for not believing
We are not your kind of people
Speak a different language
We see through your lies
We are not your kind of people
Won't be cast as demons
Creatures you despise

We are extraordinary people
We are extraordinary people
We are extraordinary people
We are extraordinary people2Embed
