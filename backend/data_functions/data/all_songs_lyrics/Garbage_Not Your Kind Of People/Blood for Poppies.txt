Blood for Poppies Lyrics
Salute the sun, I've been sitting here all night long
Hauling rock over Buddha with the Longhorn
Got a hole, rip a pocket off my uniform
With the Blackwatch Boys, get your heads down
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Duty calls but it's way too late, I'm too far gone
Waiting for Godot, hell, with my pants down
Cracked the stash, sent me crying in the midday sun
I miss my dog and I miss my freedom (Freedom)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right (Know I'm right)

I hate the things I think about you when I'm all alone
I know you're tough, but I've been gone for so long
Play the memories of you inside my head
So all these pictures of us burn and radiate
Watch the clouds and I'm falling, falling through the cracks
Head beats and the heart is pounding fast
Off the ground into the starry dark
Into your arms I'm falling (Falling, falling)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Falling, falling)
Oh-oh (Falling, falling), oh-oh, oh-oh (Falling)

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right
I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right (Know I'm right)
(...Keep on falling)
My brain, my body's fried
I've got to stay alive
I've gotta take a chance and keep on moving
Keep on moving

I don't know why they are calling on the radio
They know I'm here just out of sight
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
He's by my side and I know I'm right
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's on my side and I know I'm right (I see your light from miles away)
Don't know why they are calling on the radio
It's on my side and I know I'm alright
(I see your light from miles away)
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(I see your light from miles away)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)3Embed
