What Girls Are Made Of Lyrics
Tell me, please, what little girls are made of
Sugar and spice and all things nice
But we can bleed for a whole week straight
Every month, and the pain doesn't faze us

Do you really think we give a shit
About what you said
Or what you ever did?
Do what you want, but I'm not listening
Cause I'm not fucking about

You think you know what I can do
My virgin tongue, oh see how it fools you

Do you really think I give a shit
About anything you said
Or what you ever did?
Say what you want, but I'm not listening
Cause I'm not fucking about

Yeah you!
Haven't you heard?
I let you off with murder
And I've been drinking again
It helps to blot you out
Cause if I stop to think
I swear I'll lose it
Watch me cutting every string
One by one (one by one)
See me cut out all the rot
Bit by bit (bit by bit)
Watch me as I push you back
Inch by inch (inch by inch)
I push you back, boy
Inch by inch (back, boy)
(Inch by inch)

Yeah you!
Haven't you heard?
I let you off with murder
And I've been drinking again
It helps to blot you out
Cause if I stop to think
I swear I'll lose it

Tell me, please, what little girls are made of1Embed
