Beloved Freak Lyrics
You're not certain when you feel
Hurt, get violent when you deal
With how the world drags you along
You're not alone
Nothing good was ever free
No one gets it, no one sees
So here you stand, beloved freak
You're not alone

You're not alone
You're not alone
Sometimes we get so tired and weak
We lose the sky beneath our feet
You're not alone

Every comet throws an arc
And scars our vision 'cross the dark
When we're gone we will remain
You're not alone
People lie and people steal
They misinterpret how you feel
And so we doubt and we conceal
You're not alone
Don't worry for me
Just think of yourself, think of yourself
Don't worry for me
Just think of yourself, think of yourself

When we're gone we will remain
When we're gone we will remain
When we're gone we will remain
When we're gone we will remain

So here you stand, beloved freak
The world is at your feet
Here you stand, beloved freak
The world is at your feet
This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine
This little light of mine
I'm going to let it shine
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine
And so you stand, beloved freak
The world's lying at your feet
There you stand, beloved freak
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shineEmbed
