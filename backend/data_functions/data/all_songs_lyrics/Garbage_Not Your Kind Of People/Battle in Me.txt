Battle in Me Lyrics
Look at you, an accident of drinking
What a mess, a train wreck of lipstick
What a joke, but do you hear me laughing?
Get out my face before I lose my patience
Now me and you, let's cut this party
Oh little boy, it takes a lot to shake me
So shake it

It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you
It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you

It's a bloody war of attrition
Let's see which one of us is going to last the night
Cause I have all of my wits around me
And I'll be damned if I'm done
"White Rabbit" plays right when the room starts spinning
Make it hard, I want something to happen
So make it happen

It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you
It's the battle in me
It's the battle in you
Let's take a torch
To the past and the future
And let's make out
I won't tell your girlfriend
See how it feels with a passion burning
We'll be damned when we're done

Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it off

Cause it's the battle in you
It's the battle in me
Cause it's the battle in you
It's the battle in me

Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it
Shake it off
Shake it, shake it
Shake it off1Embed
