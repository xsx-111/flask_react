Man on a Wire Lyrics
I looked into the mirror
What did I see?
There was a big black beast
Looking back at me
You looked into my eyes
What did you see?
You saw a big black beast
Magnified in me

Like a man on a wire
I set myself on fire
Destroyer of a dream
Trying to find a spark
Desperate for love
Like a man on a wire

I was like a volcano
Just waiting to explode
I have been resurrected, reborn
And I have been transformed
I was a green eyed monster
Could you tell I was afraid?
I sat myself down and shot my fear in the face
Like a man on a wire
I set myself on fire
Destroyer of a dream
Trying to find a spark
Desperate for love
Like a man on a wire

That's right
Yeah, I see you sitting around
With your wristwatch
And your white collared shirt
I see you hoping to watch me fail
You're hoping to watch me fail
I sat myself down and shot my fear in the face

Like a man on a wire
I set myself on fire
Destroyer of a dream
Trying to find a spark
Desperate for love
Like a man on a wire
I set myself on fire
Destroyer of a dream
Trying to find a spark
Desperate for love
Like a man on a wire1Embed
