Sugar Lyrics
Give me sugar, give me something sweet
I've spent a lifetime, feelin' incomplete
If I sound bitter or if I've come too late
Please reconsider, I don’t need much on my plate
Just give me sugar

Don't come close, please keep at a distance
Look but don't touch till the light goes on
Sour as a lemon
Please wait at the window
Don't touch the glass till the curtain calls
Wait, wait…
Don't make me wait
Wait, wait…
Don't make me wait
Just give me sugar

Give me sugar, give me, something deep
Don’t make a habit of crawling on my knees
But this is different, can't you see I'm in control
This is the moment where all your dreams have flown
Just give me sugar
Don't come close, please keep at a distance
Look but don't touch till the light goes on
Sour as a lemon
Please wait at the window
Don't touch the glass till the curtain calls
Wait, wait…
Don't make me wait
Wait, wait…
Don't make me wait
Just give me sugar

To hook her on
Sugar to hook her on
Some sugar to hook her on
Sugar to hook her on
Oh, won’t someone love me
Won’t someone love me
Won’t someone love me
Oh, won’t someone love me
