The One Lyrics
Yeah right from the start you had me hooked
And I knew I was falling
And sure you had me sussed
You worked me out
You took me right out no doubt

Call me a lawyer
I want to micromanage
I need a hit man
Get me the operator
Call me a doctor
I cannot lose control
There must be someone
A robot, a terminator?
He got me eye balled
He got me tied down
He got me roller coaster
Help me, man down
Don't wanna talk about it
I know a lot about it
He got me on the ropes and I don't like it

You might be the one, the one for me
You might be the one, the one for me
You might be the one for me
You might be
The one
You know what I want
You see me sweat and lose all confidence
And you, you mess me up
I'm back to front
You know I want you, don't you?

Call me a lawyer
I want to micromanage
I need a hit man
Get me the operator
Call me a doctor
I cannot lose control
There must be someone
A robot, a terminator?
He got me eye balled
He got me tied down
He got me roller coaster
Help me, man down
Don't wanna talk about it
I know a lot about it
He got me on the ropes and I don't like it

You might be the one, the one for me
You might be the one, the one for me
You might be the one for me
You might be
The one
Call me a lawyer
I want to micromanage
I need a hit man
And get me the operator
Call me a doctor
I cannot lose control
There must be someone
A robot, a terminator?
He got me eye balled
He got me tied down
He got me roller coaster
Help me, man down
Don't wanna talk about it
I know a lot about it
He got me on the ropes and I don't like it

You might be the one, the one for me
You might be the one, the one for me
You might be the one for me
You might be
