Felt Lyrics
Felt sure you felt something
Felt sure, but it really was nothing
You felt, but you're only guessing

They're only feelings, baby
They're only feelings

Felt I'd left you hanging
Felt sure I'd stopped myself caring
You felt, that I'd stopped believing

They're only feelings, baby
They're only feelings

What is real?
Is real reason?
What is real?
Is real reason?
What is real?
Is real reason?
What is real?
I still get you
Do you still get me?
Felt my skin on your skin
Felt sure, sensations like raining
You felt, no logical thinking

They're only feelings, baby
They're only feelings
