Love Like Suicide Lyrics
All the money, all the pearls
All the rubies in the world
They can't buy her
They can't have her
They'll just have to use somebody else
All the money on the walls
All the people that you can call

A love like suicide
When opposites collide
You dive into it blind
A love like suicide
Love like suicide

It's all there is
It's all you've got
It's all you want
It's all you need

All the kudos, all the praise
All the connections that we make
All the queerlords, all the girls
All the love in the world
All the changes, all the fun
All the damage that could be done

A love like suicide
When opposites collide
You dive into it blind
A love like suicide
Love like suicide

Love like suicide
Love like suicide
Love like suicide
Love like suicide
Love like suicide
Love like suicide
It's all there is
Love like suicide
It's all you've got1Embed
