Control Lyrics
The world might end, the night might fall
Rain on down and cover us all
And drown us with the burdens of our sins
Maybe I'll look you in the eye
Tell you "you don't wanna die"
Maybe I'll hold my breath and jump right in
Maybe I'll hold my breath and jump right in

I never saw you coming from inside my little prison
Your autograph would really buy me time
If you think you are the reason
Give me something to believe in
It's always darkest right before the dawn
It's always darkest right before the dawn

I confess I've lost control
I let my guard down
I let the truth out
Oh I confess I've lost control
I let my guard down
I let the truth out

A final celebration
A bad hallucination
Flip a coin and see which way I fall
The charlatan is singing
We love to watch him killing
And suffer through a never ending day
Suffer through a never ending day
I can feel I've lost control
I let my guard down
I let the truth out
Oh I can feel I've lost control
You let your guard down
You let the truth out

I was trapped like a prisoner in my skin
I was punished like an animal for my sins
I was bound and I was caged and I was tricked
And I was suffocating
I was suffocating

I can feel I've lost control
Oh I concede we've lost control
I was suffocating
I confess I've lost control
And I was suffocating
I was suffocating
I concede we've lost control
Feel my hunger
Feel my hunger
I was suffocatingEmbed
