Bright Tonight Lyrics
From the beginning
We were always going to fail
We were the next thing
That the world could not wait to tear down

Off balance in our own minds
Off balance in the ways we looked to everybody else
On and on all summer long, we never stood a chance

Shine bright tonight
Live forever always bright tonight
You be who you are
You be who you are forever
You be who you are
You're my brightest star across the sky
You're bright tonight

It was right now
And then suddenly it's gone
We were both wrong
But here we are, we're right where we belong
Off balance in our own lives
Off balance in the ways we looked to everybody else
On and on all summer long, we never stood a chance

Shine bright tonight
Live forever always bright tonight
Yeah, you
You be who you are
You be who you are forever
You be who you are
You're my brightest star across the sky
You're bright tonight

You're bright tonight
You're bright tonight
You're bright tonight
You're bright tonight
You shine tonightEmbed
