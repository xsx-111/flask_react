I Hate Love Lyrics
Your words are pretty but I already know who you are
I knew you before you met me, long before we would part
Before you tricked me and laid on my bones
Before you kissed me and buried my hope
Before you stole my spirit and rode the show into the wall

Shore you up
They lay all their dreams on you
They let you in and you start to believe you're soft as a miracle

Unfurled, I was new and unfurled
Innocent and open as any lamb and hoping for paradise

Yeah I hate love
Yeah I hate love
So I hate love
Yeah I hate love

Love leaves you desperate and feeling a fool
Love makes you ruthless and love makes you cruel
And love makes you crazy with nothing but lies
Love promises nothing and then your love dies
Unfurled, I was new and unfurled
Innocent and open as any lamb and hoping for paradise

Yeah I hate love
Yeah I hate love
So I hate love
Yeah I hate love
(Hey, it's me. Call me)
Then your love dies
(It's 2 AM, where are you?)
Then your love dies
(Where are you?)
Then your love dies
(Can you call me? Can you call me back?)4Embed
