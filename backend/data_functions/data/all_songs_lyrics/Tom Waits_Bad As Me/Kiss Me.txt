Kiss Me LyricsThe fire's dying out, all the embers have been spent
Outside on the street, lovers hide in the shadows
You look at me, I look at you
There's only one thing I want you to do
Kiss me
I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again
Kiss me like a stranger once again
I wanna believe that our love's a mystery
I wanna believe that our love's a sin
I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again
You wear the same kind of perfume you wore when we met
I suppose there's something comforting in knowing what to expect
But when you brushed up against me before I knew your name
Everything was thrilling 'cause nothing was the same
Now I want you to kiss me
I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again
Kiss me like a stranger once again
I wanna believe our love's a mystery
I wanna believe our love's a sin
Oh, will you kiss me like a stranger once again?
I want you to kiss me like a stranger
Kiss me like a stranger once againEmbed
