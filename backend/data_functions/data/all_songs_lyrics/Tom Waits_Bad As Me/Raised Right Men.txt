Raised Right Men LyricsThere ain’t enough raised right men
I said there ain't enough raised right men
It takes a raised right man to keep a happy hen
I said there ain’t enough raised right men
Heavens to murgatroid, miners to coal
A good woman can make a diamond out of a measly lump of coal
And you need the patience of a glacier, if you can wait that long
Open up his window and admit it when you’re wrong
There ain’t enough raised right
There ain't enough raised right men
I said there ain't enough raised right men
It takes raised right man to keep a happy hen
I said there ain't enough raised right men
Mackey Debiasi was a complicated man
He quarreled with his woman and she quarreled with her man
And his head was just too thick, so she knocked out a tooth
He’s that lonely man on the turnpike in the tolltaker's booth
There ain’t enough raised right
There ain't enough raised right men
I said there just ain't enough raised right men
It takes raised right man to keep a happy hen
I said there ain't enough raised right men
Gunplay Maxwell and Flat Nose George
Ice Pick Ed Newcomb on a slab in the morgue
Flat Nose looked at Gunplay and they all looked at me
With a good woman’s love, we could have saved all three
There ain’t enough raised right
Ain't enough raised right
Ain't enough raised right
Ain't enough raised right men
I said there ain't enough raised right men
It takes raised right man to keep a happy hen
I said, ain't enough raised right men
I said there ain't enough raised right men
I said there ain't enough raised right men1Embed
