Face to the Highway LyricsI’m going away
I’m going away
I’m going away
I’m going away
The cradle wants a baby, kitchen wants a pan
The heart wants a certain kind of lover, if it can
The ocean wants a sailor, a gun wants a hand
Money wants a spender and the road wants a man
I'll turn my face to the highway
I'll turn my face to the highway
I'll turn my face to the highway
And I'll turn my back on you
Devil wants a sinner, the sky wants a bird
The table wants the dinner and the lips want a word
Glass wants the wine, a fist wants to hurt
A clock wants the time and the shovel wants to work
I'll turn my face to the highway
I'll turn my face to the highway
I'll turn my face to the highway
And I'll turn my back on you
I’m going away
I’m going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
Coal wants a miner, soldier takes a stand
The walls of the prison want a solitary man
The window wants a curtain, the plow wants the land
Diamond ring wants to fit upon the finger of her hand
I'll turn my face to the highway
I'll turn my face to the highway
I'll turn my face to the highway
And I'll turn my back on you
Going away
I’m going away
I’m going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going away
I'm going awayEmbed
