Chicago LyricsThe seeds are planted here, but they won’t grow
We won’t have to say goodbye if we all go
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
To leave all we’ve ever known for a place we’ve never seen
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
Well it’s brave for us to stay, even braver to go
Wherever she goes, I go
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
What we need, the Lord will give us
All we want, we carry with us
You know where I can be found
Where the rainbow hits the ground
I’m not alone, I’m not afraid
'Cause this bird has flown from his cage
There’s so much magic we have known
On this sapphire we call home
With my coat and my hat
I say goodbye to all that
Maybe things will be better in Chicago
Maybe things will be better in ChicagoEmbed
