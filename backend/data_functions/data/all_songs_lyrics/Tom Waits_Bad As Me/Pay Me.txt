Pay Me LyricsThey pay me not to come home, keeping me stoned
I won’t run away
They say it’s easy to get stuck in this town just like Joan
You know I gave it all up for the stage
They fill my cup up in the cage
It’s nobody’s business but mine when I’m low
To hold yourself up is not a crime here you know
At the end of the world
And I kick my foot at the lights
And I breathe it in all night
There’s a light on a canvas tree
Money from home is supporting me
They pay me not to come home
I won’t eat crow, I'll stay away
And though all roads will not lead you home, my girl
All roads lead to the end of the world
And I sewed a little luck up in the hem of my gown
The only way down from the gallows is to swing
And I’ll wear boots instead of high heels
And the next stage that I am on, it will have wheelsEmbed
