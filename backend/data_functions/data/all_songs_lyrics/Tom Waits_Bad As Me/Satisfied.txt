Satisfied LyricsWhen I’m gone
When I’m gone
Roll my vertebrae out like dice
Let my skull be a home for the mice
Let me bleach like the bones on a beach
I’ll be hard like a pit from a peach
Now the ground has a branch
Now the hound has a ranch
The old tressel’s just junk
The Edsel is on blocks
The old said-so won’t talk
I’m a blimp that’s straining, cut’ er ties
I’m a moth in training, flutter by
Huh
When I’m gone
When I’m gone
I said I will have satisfaction
I will be satisfied
I said I will be satisfied
When I’m believing: satisfaction
When I’m grieving: satisfaction
When I’m shaking: satisfaction
When I’m praying: satisfaction
When I’m staying: satisfaction
When I’m carousing
When I’m a thousand
I said I will have satisfaction
I will be satisfied
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
I will have satisfaction
I will be satisfied
I will have satisfaction
I will be satisfied
Now Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards
I will scratch where I’ve been itching
Now Mr. Jagger and Mr. Richards
I will scratch where I’ve been itching
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
Let me go back into the barrel
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone
I said I will have satisfaction
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Take a left off the straight and the narrow
Let the bullet go back into the barrel
Before I’m gone
Before I’m gone1Embed
