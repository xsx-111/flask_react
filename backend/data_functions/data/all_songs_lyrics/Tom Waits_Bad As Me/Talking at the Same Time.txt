Talking at the Same Time LyricsGet a job, save your money, listen to Jane
Everybody knows umbrellas cost more in the rain
All the news is bad, is there any other kind?
And everybody’s talking at the same time
And everybody’s talking at the same time
Well, it’s hard times for some, for others, it’s sweet
Someone makes money when there’s blood in the street
Don’t take any lip, stay in line
Everybody’s talking at the same time
Well, the dog is in the kitchen and the war drags on
The trees wait by the freeway, all the money is gone
Well, she told me she would leave me, I ignored all the signs
And now everybody’s talking at the same time
Everybody’s talking at the same time
Ain’t no one coming to pull you from the mud
You gotta build your nest high enough to ride out the flood
I know you’re leaving and there’s no more next time
Everybody’s talking at the same time
A tiny boy sat and he played in the sand
He made a sword from a stick and a gun from his hand
Well, we bailed out all the millionaires
They’ve got the fruit, we’ve got the rind
And everybody’s talking at the same time
Everybody’s talking at the same timeEmbed
