After All... LyricsAfter all you were perfectly right
But I'm scaring close to insanity
And on a night like this
Nothing stays the same
Nothing looks the same
After all you were perfectly right
Our relation just split me in two
And on a night like this
Pieces fall apart
Visions fall apart
After all you were perfectly right
I have never been happy before
And on a night like this
You can hear the words
See behind the words
After all you were perfectly wrong
Though I thought I'd found love
And on a night like this
Nothing could be worse
Nothing could be worseEmbed
