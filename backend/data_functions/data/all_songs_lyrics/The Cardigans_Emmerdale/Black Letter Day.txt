Black Letter Day Lyrics
I did all that I should
Well all that I could
But will I be clean?
I did all that I should
Well all that I could
But it isn't me

All my strength is dead and gone

Slept as long as I could
As long as I should
To find comfort here
Slept as long as I could
As long as I should
But I still have fear

All my strength is dead and gone

Black letter day
All the fun has gone away
Black letter day
All the joy has gone away
Black letter day
All my strength has gone away
Black letter day
I drank all that I could
Much more than I should
In simple despair
I drank all that I could
Much more than I should
To find someone there

All my strength is dead and gone

Black letter day
All the fun has gone away
Black letter day
All the joy has gone away
Black letter day
All my strength has gone away
Black letter day

Once upon a time there was a scientist with a nose made of silver
He found that there were thirty worthless days a year
That one could do without
He called them black letter days
And the rest is silence
Well, all my strength is dead and gone

Black letter day
All the fun has gone away
Black letter day
All the joy has gone away
Black letter day
All my strength has gone away
Black letter day

I hope Monday will be a better dayEmbed
