Seems Hard Lyrics
Seems hard to understand
I think no one can
Not anyone I know
No, wait I think I know
One who does
At least that's what he says

And what I mean is what I say
But I've got thoughts left anyway

Seems hard to understand
I'm not sure myself
Sure of what to think
I know I should trust myself
At least that's what he says

And what I mean is what I say
But I've got thoughts left anyway

Seems hard to understand
I think no one did
Not anyone I knew
Well, I thought I knew
One who did
It was only as he saidEmbed
