Sabbath Bloody Sabbath Lyrics
You've seen life through distorted eyes
You know you had to learn
The execution of your mind
You really had to turn
The race is run the book is read
The end begins to show
The truth is out, the lies are old
But you don't want to know

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
And fill your head all full of lies

The people who have crippled you
You want to see them burn
The gates of life have closed on you
There is just no return

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
And fill your head all full of lies
Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why
They just tell you that you're on your own
And fill your head all full of lies

No one, no one, nobody
No one, no one, nobody
No one, no one, nobody
Nobody would ever let you know
No one, no one, nobody
When you ask the reasons why
No one, no one, nobody
They just tell you that you're on your own
No one, no one, nobody
And fill your head all full of lies
And fill your head all full of lies
Full of lies
All full of lies
Of lies, of lies
Of lies, of liesEmbed
