In the Afternoon Lyrics
Winter came by my bedroom today
Falling in rows and covering the lane
Morning shone on my windows today
Passing the time I slumber away, to kill all the day

Stumbling up at one and put the kettle on
But where's the coffee gone in the afternoon
I put the TV on, but where's the drama gone
In the afternoon and time is all that pass

Someone came by my bedroom today
Swaying around, then silently away
Someone left home my bedroom today
Left by the time I slumbered away, to kill all the day

Stumbling up at one and put the kettle on
But where's the coffee gone in the afternoon
I put the TV on, but where's the drama gone
In the afternoon and time is all that pass

Some people don't hurry
Don't you worry they say
One day I'll be older
So much colder I say
This fear won't appear, if I keep
Stumbling up at one and put the kettle on
But where's the coffee gone in the afternoon
I put the TV on, but where's the drama gone
In the afternoon and time is all that pass

Winter came by my bedroom today
Falling in rows and covering the lane
Morning shone on my windows today
Passing the time I slumber away, to kill all the dayEmbed
