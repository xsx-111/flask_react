Cloudy Sky Lyrics
I'd catch some stars for you
And just for you
And I'd paint the gray sky blue
And just for you
I'd catch some stars for you
And just for you
I'd paint the gray sky blue
And just for you

So don't tell me you want the rain

From a cloudy sky
To wash away the pain
That I've you given you again
I've always tried to find
What satisfies your mind
But I will never know where you are to go
But I want you to know
Do you want a golden ring?
I would buy you anything

I'd read some poems for you
Just for you
And I hope they won't make you blue
Like they used to do
So please tell me they're like the rain

From this cloudy sky
That wash away the pain
That I've you given you again
I've always tried to find
What satisfies your mind

Don't tell me you want the rain
Don't tell me you want the rain

From this cloudy sky
To wash away the pain
That I've given you again
I've always tried to find
What satisfies your mind
But one can never know where you are to go
But I want you to know
Do you want a golden ring?
I would buy you anythingEmbed
