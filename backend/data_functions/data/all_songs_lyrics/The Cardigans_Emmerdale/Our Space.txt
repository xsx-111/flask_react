Our Space LyricsMy dear, please see my dear
How we invented the fear
Inside that space
No one could interfere
My dear, please see my dear
How we invented the tears
Inside that space
No one could interfere
Interfere
No one
No one could interfere
My dear, please see my dear
How we invented the fear
Inside that space
No one could interfere
Invented the fear
Couldn't break out on that space
No one, no one could interfere
In that space
Our spaceEmbed
