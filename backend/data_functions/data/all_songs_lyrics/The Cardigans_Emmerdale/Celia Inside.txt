Celia Inside Lyrics
You don't want the sun to shine in
So you turn the curtains down
Your eyes still don't show me a thing
And you don't feel it's sunny outside
You don't want the joy for a while
But you'll stay up late at night
It hurts you that she's still alive
So you'll raise flowerbeds inside

But she, she will not get bothered at all
She's just watching the water at fall
So you should give them just what they need
Water and poetry
Cause she will not bother at all
She's just watching the water at fall
So you should give them just what they need
Cause she will not bother at all
But you won't say you're not adored by her beauty
Celia inside

You don't want to feel her at all
But who's that fellowman of hers?
With who, your dear Celia moved
And they'll sleep happily inside
But she, she will not get bothered at all
She's just watching the water at fall
So you should give them just what they need
Water and poetry
Cause she will not bother at all
She's just watching the water at fall
So you should give them just what they need
Cause she will not bother at all
But you won't say you're not adored by her beauty
Celia inside

And you'll raise flowerbeds inside

But she, she will not get bothered at all
She's just watching the water at fall
So you should give them just what they need
Water and poetry
Cause she will not bother at all
She's just watching the water at fall
So you should give them just what they need
Cause she will not bother at all
But you won't say you're not adored by her beauty
Celia inside
And her purity
And her lovely
Celia inside
