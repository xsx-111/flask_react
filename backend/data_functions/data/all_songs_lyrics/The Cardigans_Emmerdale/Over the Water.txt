Over the Water Lyrics
Turn away and the collar
Because the blowing is dry
Walk away to the harbor
Before your ships will fly
Slip away and the pillow
Because it's falling of down
Trot away and around
Because your ships are found

Somewhere over the water
Next to a harbor
Someone's eager to listen
Somewhere over the water
Next to a harbor
Someone, someone to be in

Turn away and the collar
Because the blowing is dry
Walk away to the harbor
Before your ships will fly

Somewhere over the water
Next to a harbor
Someone's eager to listen
Somewhere over the water
Next to a harbor
Someone, someone to be
Someone, someone to be
Someone, someone to be inEmbed
