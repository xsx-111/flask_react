Last Song Lyrics
The night she died in the rented room
As the whole town was sleeping
She held her breath like a star in bloom
Could burn down tomorrow
The summer breeze was caressing me
As I walked through the market
The golden light of a friend beside
Had died out for good

Now nothing can amaze me
As everything's behind me
No, nothing else can please me
Since all I had has been set free

The night before in the dining room
I recall it now
She said "I fear for you my love
Cause I'll soon be leaving"
The autumn comes just like other years
But I won't see the signs
The sun above is sowing magic seeds
But it wants someone back
Now nothing can amaze me
As everything's behind me
No, nothing else can please me
Since all I had has been set freeEmbed
