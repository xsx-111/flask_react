Burning Rope Lyrics
The warming sun, the cooling rain
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze
The lightning bolt that frees the sky for you
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through
The words of love, the cries of hate
And the man in the moon who seduced you
Then finally loosed you

You climbed upon a burning rope to escape the mob below
But you had put the flaming out so that others could now follow
To be out of the bounds and the barks of those who do not wish you well
You must blaze a trail of your own, unknown, alone
But keep in mind
Don't live to-day for tomorrow like you were immortal
The only survivors on this world of ours are...

The warming sun, the cooling rain
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze
The lightning bolt that frees the sky for you
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through
The words of love, the cries of hate
And the man in the moon who seduced you
Then finally loosed you

You're old
And disillusioned now as you realise at last that
All you have accomplished here will 've soon all turn'd to dust
You dream of a future afterlife, well that's maybe I don't know
But you can't take what you left behind, you're all alone
So keep in mind
Don't live to-day for tomorrow like you were immortal
The only survivors on this world of ours are...

The warming sun, the cooling rain
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze
The lightning bolt that frees the sky for you
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through
The words of love, the cries of hate
And the man in the moon who seduced you
Then finally loosed youEmbed
