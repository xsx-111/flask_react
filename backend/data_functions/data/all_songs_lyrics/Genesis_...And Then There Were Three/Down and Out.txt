Down and Out Lyrics
It's good to be here! How've you been?
Check my bags, boy! Where's my room?
Gotta sit on the phone, that's my game
Keep up the pressure all the way!

I don't want to beat about the bush
But none of us are getting any younger
There's people out there who could take your place
A more commercial view, fresher face

I need a shower, take a nap
I'll meet you in the bar, we must have a rap
There's a lot on the line, a lot to say
And there's something I must tell you today

You and I both knew the score
You can't go on like this forever
So it's with regret that I tell you now
That from this moment on
You're on your own!

I don't talk round corners, right between the eyes
If you're slow they'll run past you
Stand tall, see them falling over
I walk a straight line, right between the eyes
But show me the door, show me someone who'll do it better
The drinks are on me, be my guest
Smoke a cigar? Take the best
Don't hedge your bets, we can make a deal
Got it in your pocket, how do you feel?

So glad that's over, now you know
But I'm only acting under orders
And looking down on you from way up here
You've gotta sink or swim, get off the floor!

I don't talk round corners, it's right between the eyes
If you're slow they'll run past you
Stand tall, see them falling over
I walk a straight line, right between the eyes
But show me the door, show me someone who'll do it betterEmbed
