Smoking Jacket Lyrics
I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts

He might be heavy on the pedal
But he knows how to take it slow
He might be quite continental
But he's sure gonna take me home
Yes, he is

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a car that's classic living bourgeoisie
I want a man whose heart is tragic
But he makes his magic every night on me

We go together just like nicotine and Chanel
And when he lights up I'm his Lucky Strike
Waiting for him to exhale

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And a deeper pocket with money to burn
I want a man who knows his status
And he makes a habit of loving me 'til it hurts
Velvet and refined, he's designed to hold me
I don't need a diamond, I like wearing his smoke rings
I want a man, I want a man
I want a man

I want a man with a smoking jacket
And he lights his matches with kerosene

I want a man, I want a man
I want a man with a smoking jacket
I want a man, I want a man
I want a man with a smoking jacketEmbed
