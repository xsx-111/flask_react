Well-Rested Lyrics
Well, this moment is heavy
For me, I'm not ready
Like a caged bird barely set free
Forgive me, I'm finding my wings

While my body is present
My heart is absent
And my mind is racing
And my feet are pacing

It's your tail you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And your heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested

My gears are grinding
I'm leaving, you're arriving
It's a matter of timing
I guess loving ain't surviving

It's your tail that you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And a heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested
It's your tail that you're chasing
It's the past I'm erasing
And a heart can't be tested
When it ain't well-rested

Don't waste your investment
If a heart ain't well-rested, ooh-ooh
My heart ain't well-restedEmbed
