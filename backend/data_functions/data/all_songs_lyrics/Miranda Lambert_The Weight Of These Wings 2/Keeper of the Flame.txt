Keeper of the Flame Lyrics
I'm walking in their footsteps
I'm singing their old songs
Somebody blazed this trail
I'm treadin' on
I'm bent, but I'm not broken
I'm stronger than I feel
I'm made of flesh and bone
Not made of steel

I'm the keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
For the ones that came before me
For the little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame

I've been burned out to ashes
Waiting for a wind
To carry me and start a fire again
Sometimes I'm just a flicker
A candle in your eye
But I swear to God
I'll never let it die
I'm the keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
For the ones that came before me
For the little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame

When I'm drowning
When I'm fighting
When I'm screaming
When I'm hiding
When I'm losing
When I'm winning
I go back to
The beginning

Keeper of the flame
The teller of the story
Keeper of the flame
I'm not doing it for the glory
But for those little pilot lights waiting to ignite
Like fireflies in the rain
Keeper of the flame
I'm the keeper of the flame
Ooh, ooh
I'm the keeper of the flame
Ooh, oohEmbed
