Chapel Hill Lyrics
Back in the days when the battles raged
And we thought it was nothing
A bookstore man meets the CIA
And we know
Throw me a cord and plug it in
Get the Cradle rocking
Out with the redneck pig old men
And it's gold

Hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memory's in the shadow
Back in time again

I can't forget your terrorized face
When you cried for the shameless
Wasted life AmeriK-K-Kan
And you smiled
Said why should we run when we can not hide?
And my flag is burnin'
We could be wrong but that's alright
We'll rise again
Hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memory's in the shadow
It's back in town again

Lookin' away it's another day
And of course we love you
But radical man meets the CIA
And we said no
We'll round up the Durham H. C. kids
And the Char-Grill killers
Jesse H. coming to our pit
All ages show

Hair in the hole in my head
Too bad the scene is dead
Memory's in the shadow
It's back in time againEmbed
