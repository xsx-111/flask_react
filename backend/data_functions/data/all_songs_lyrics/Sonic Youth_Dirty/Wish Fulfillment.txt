Wish Fulfillment Lyrics
I see your wishes on the wall
And that's all right with me
I see you run to make a call
Hoping that there's someone free
Your life and my life, they don't touch at all
And that's no way to be
We've never seemed so far

What's real? What's true?
I ain't turning my back on you
Where you going? Where you been?
Making wishes, watching dreams

It might be simple, it might be true
I might be overwhelmed by you
You might be empty
The way your eyes just look right through
It's such a mess now anyway
Wish fulfillment every day
I don't believe you
Now I can't hear a word you say

I see you shaking in the light
Reading the headline news
The others, they're not quite so bright
You want them to choose you
I could almost see your face tonight
Singing simple rhythm 'n' blues
You'll always be a star
Shake it baby, come on scream!
Did I see your face in a magazine?
Don't doubt it, that's the sore
I can't stand it anymore

It's my favorite shot of you
You look so pretty, your eyes were true
I'm still on your side
In spite of everything you do
We're only blood on light on life
New pretty pictures every night
Come wish beside me
Don't you know, you know what's right?2Embed
