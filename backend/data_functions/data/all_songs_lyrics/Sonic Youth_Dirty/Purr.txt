Purr Lyrics
Wahoo!

I love you baby 'cause you're back in time
I love you today
Your eyes are flashing like a magic sign
The sun comes out to play

I learned it all from you girl, I got it all from you
How to howl the moon yeah, and how to scratch your dog
I do it every day, come back again tomorrow
You chased it all away

A dreaming beauty sleeping day and night
The sun around you
I love you baby yeah you're superfine
A-coming down too
A purring whirring fuzzy lights of day
A-switching sunlight
I chase you kitten catch you every time
Funny how it flies

I learned it all from you girl, I got it all from you
How to howl the moon yeah, and how to scratch your dog
I do it every day, come back again tomorrow
You chased it all away
I hear you purring through a supersoul
A-puff in to it
A puss in leather yeah a prince in gold
Aleather tale away

I learned it all from you girl, I got it all from you
How to howl the moon yeah, and how to scratch your dog
I do it every day, come back again tomorrow
You chased it all awayEmbed
