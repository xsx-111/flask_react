JC Lyrics
Always cost a pair of hose
Faces pressed together rose
Arms around each other's back
You know that I liked you jack
Than all the other boys who pose
A silent dance in the woods
In the silver light that shone
Another can of Coca-Cola
Don't you ever call me mom
Freckled dance ain't in the plan
The air's so thin, it weighs a ton
As far as you can see is fun
You're nothing but a history
A second here and then you're gone

Quicksand, quicksand all around
Turn the corner just beyond
The shadows move and change the groove
And something tells me not to brood
Turn and run and that's a shove
You're walking through my heart once more
Don't forget to close the door
I'm not certain what you found
I'll remember the charm you wore
Like a crowd followed you
Sunny skies and angel's pleas
Floating down upon my knees
That wasn't how it's supposed to be
Clear blue eyes, justice tries
The wind is busy blowing dizzy
You're dreams were shot like a star
Exploding in a mind somewhere
Doing something on a dare
Pulling a trigger like breathing air
A sun-kissed boy that gave no thought
To what he'd made while others saved

Ocean spray the candle said
It's dripping in my hand, you're dead
Little brother reminding me
The moments tick forever tree
You can see as far as sin
Don't you know the shape I'm in
You're walking through my heart once more
Don't forget to close the door2Embed
