Swimsuit Issue Lyrics
I'm just here for dictation
I don't wanna be a sensation
Being on sixty minutes
Was it worth your fifteen minutes?

Don't touch my breast
I'm just working at my desk
Don't put me to the test
I'm just doing my best

Shopping at Maxfields
Power for you to wield
Dreams of going to the Grammys
Till you poked me with your whammy

You spinned the discs
Now you're moving your wrist
I'm just from Encino
Why are you so mean-o?

I'm just here for dictation
And not your summer vacation
You really like to schmooze
Well now you're on the news
I'm from Sherman Oaks
Just a wheel with spokes
But I ain't giving you head
In a sunset bungalow
