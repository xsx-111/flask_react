100% Lyrics
I can never forget you
The way you rock the girls
They rule the world and love you
A blast in the underworld
I stick a knife in my head
A-thinking 'bout your eyes
But now that you been shot dead
I got a new surprise

But I been waitin' for you just to say
The zoftig chick is mine
But all I know is you got no money
But that's got nothing to do with a good time

Can you forgive the boy who
Shot you in the head
Or should you get a gun and
Go and get revenge?
A 100% of my love
Up to you true star
It's hard to believe you took off
I always thought you'd go far
But I been around the world a million times
And all you men are slime
It gone to my head
Goodbye I am dead
Wastewood rockers is time for crime
Hey
