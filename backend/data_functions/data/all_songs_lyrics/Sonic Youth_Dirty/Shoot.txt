Shoot Lyrics
Can I have some money? I'm gonna go to the store
Can I have some money? I can't tell you what it's for
Can I have some money? You know it's you that I adore
Can I have some money? Don't ask me what it's for

Since we've been together, you've been good to me
You only hit me when you wanna be pleased

Can I have the car keys? I'm gonna go for a ride
Can I have the car please? I'm going out for a while
Can I have the car now? I wanna drive all around
Can I have the car dear? I'm gonna to leave this town

I won't be asking your permission to leave
I won't be asking not to have this baby, please
And I won't be asking a devil for some bus fare, please
And I won't be asking, I hate to see you bleed

Ssssssh
Close your eyes
That's right
Pray, honey
One, two, three
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
Can I have my lipstick? That was such a surprise
Can I have my lipstick? I'm going out for a ride
I'm not a little girl, and you sure are not my dad
You don't even know what you almost hadEmbed
