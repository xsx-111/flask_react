On the Strip Lyrics
Every time you look my way
You shine a light in what you say
Every time you look my way
You talk a rhyme called purple haze

Close your eyes and pretend
You're not at all a black friend

A smile-less girl on the strip
You really learn just how to be hip
Tell your stories 'bout your crazy trip
Messing with stars and doing tricks

Close your eyes and pretend
It started all back then

Big glass house on the hill
Doing dope but did you swear
Yesterday was buried last year
While I don't care I thought was clear
Close your eyes and pretend
This is how it should end

Cinderella of the night
Doesn't know her left from right
She so hungry for a bite
Forget your friends for a big night
Don't you know who's keeping score
Who's that barking at your door

Hold tight with fear, a little bit
Hold tight with fear, a little bit
Hold tight with fear, a little bit
Hold tight with fear
That was then, this is now 

Every time you look my way
Remember a girl who used to say
Hold me tight any way
It's okay it's only play

I will remember in my dawn
What I came for, for a lark1Embed
