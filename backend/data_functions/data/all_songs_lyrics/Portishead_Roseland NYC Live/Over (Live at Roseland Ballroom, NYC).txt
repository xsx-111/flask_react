Over (Live at Roseland Ballroom, NYC) Lyrics
I can't hold this day anymore
Understand me anymore
To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over

I can't mold this stage anymore
Recognize me anymore
To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over

To tread this fantasy openly
What have I done?

Oh, this uncertainty
Is taking me over
Is taking me over
Is taking me over
Oh, it's all over, yeah
Oh, it's all over, yeah
Oh, oh ohEmbed
