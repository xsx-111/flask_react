Sour Times (Live at The Warfield, San Francisco, 1998) Lyrics
To pretend no one can find
The fallacies of morning rose
Forbidden fruit, hidden eyes
Courtesies that I despise in me
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Covered by the blind belief
That fantasies of sinful screens
Bear the facts, assume the dye
End the vows, no need to lie, enjoy
Take a ride, take a shot now

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

Who am I, what and why?
'Cause all I have left
Is my memories of yesterday
Oh, these sour times
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Not like you do

'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
'Cause nobody loves me, it's true
Nobody loves me, it's true, oh, no
Nobody loves me, not like you do, oh
It's just like it seems, only disturbed
Oh, nobody loves me, not like you do
Thank you all very muchEmbed
