Cowboys (Live at Roseland Ballroom, NYC) Lyrics
Did you sweep us far from your feet?
Reset in stone this stark belief?
Salted eyes and a soiled dye
Too many years

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Did you feed us tales of deceit?
Conceal the tongues who need to speak?
Subtle lies and a soiled coin
The truth is sold, the deal is done

But don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Undefied, no signs of regret
Your swollen pride assumes respect
Talons fly as a last disguise
But no return, the time has come
So don't despair
This day will be their damnedest day
Oh, if you take these things from me

Oh, if you take these things from meEmbed
