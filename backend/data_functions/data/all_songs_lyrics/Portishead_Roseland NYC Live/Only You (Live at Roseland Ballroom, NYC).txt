Only You (Live at Roseland Ballroom, NYC) Lyrics
"It's like that"

We suffer every day
What is it for?
These crimes of illusion are fooling us all
And now I am weary and I feel like I do

It's only you who can tear me apart
And it's only you who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight
It's just a dream
We've crushed everything I can see
In this morning selfishly
How we've failed and I feel like I do

It's only you, who can tear me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart

"It's like that"
Now that we've chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn
A stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

And it's only you, who can tear me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heart
It's only you, who can tear me apart
And it's only you, who can turn my wooden heartEmbed
