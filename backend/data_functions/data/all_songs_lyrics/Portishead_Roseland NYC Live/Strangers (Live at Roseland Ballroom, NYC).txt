Strangers (Live at Roseland Ballroom, NYC) Lyrics
Oh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realize no one can see inside your view?
Did you realize for why this sight belongs to you?

Oh
Just set aside your fears of life
With the sole desire

Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side
Done it warning, done it now
It ain't real on this side


Done it warning, done it now
And it ain't real
Done it warning, done it now
Well, it ain't real on this side
Oh
Can anybody see the light?
Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises
Did you realize no one can see inside your view?
Did you realize for why this sight belongs to you?Embed
