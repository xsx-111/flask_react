Anodyne LyricsYou threw out the past
When you threw out what was mine
Throughout the years
It was hard to make it last
Anodyne, anodyne
No sign of reconciliation
It's a quarter past the end
Full moon from on high
Across the board, we lose again
Anodyne, anodyne
Anodyne
You tossed it out for me to find
Without a word you're out the door
Without a reason anymore
Two fingers on the trigger
Can break the heart of any day
Foolish to believe
It'd turn out okay
Anodyne, anodyne
Anodyne
You tossed it out for me to find
Without a word you're out the door
Without a reason anymore
Anodyne
