High Water LyricsTried to face up to the blinding sun
Racing for the final word to come
Facing up, it's hard to stay devout
I can see the sand and it's running out
And it's running out
We quote each other only when we're wrong
Tear out the threads, move along
Can't seem to find common ground
I can see the sand and it's running out
And it's only circumstances
But it's the difference that gets in the way
No race is run in this direction
You can't break even
You can't even quit the game
The current drags to the bottom
Hemorrhage that moves us around
Pulls and beckons with strong direction
High water forever bringing us down
I can see the sand and it's running out
And it's running out
And it's only circumstances
But it's the difference that gets in the way
No race is run in this direction
You can't break even
You can't even quit the gameEmbed
