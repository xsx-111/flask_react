Acuff-Rose LyricsEarly in the morning
Sometimes late at night
Sometimes I get the feeling that everything's alright
Early in the evening
Sometimes in the day
Sometimes I get the feeling everything's okay
Because everything
Cuts against the tide
When you're by my side
Play me a song
That everybody knows
And I bet you it belongs to Acuff-Rose
Children in the playground
Folks in the home
Anybody anywhere who's ever been alone
Because everything
Cuts against the tide
When I hear that soundEmbed
