Give Back the Key to My Heart LyricsTake my picture off the wall
It don't matter to me at all
You said I was headed for a fall
But you wanted me to crawl
Give back my TV
It don't mean that much to me
While you're giving back my things
Give me back the key to my heart
Give back the key to my heart
Give back the key to my heart
And let my love flow like a river
Straight into your heart, dear
Well, you say I was the one
To blame for the wrong that's been done
Well, you've got a friend named Cocaine
And to me, he is to blame
He has drained life from your face
He has taken my place
You're alone in Santa Fe
Give me back the key to my heart
Give back the key to my heart
Give back the key to my heart
And let my love flow like a river
Straight into your heart, dearEmbed
