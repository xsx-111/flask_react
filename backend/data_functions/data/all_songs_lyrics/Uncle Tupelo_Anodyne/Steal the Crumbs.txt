Steal the Crumbs LyricsSidetracked down the middle
Never saw it coming, what a surprise
It's been a wonder
Electricity tells a story
It's a sound getting near as fear's watching you
It's watching you close
You can fight it, both arms swinging
Or try to wash it away
Pay up to the echoes of okay
No more, no more will I see you
No more will I see you
No more will I see you
You've schemed more than you have
You've borrowed more than you know better to steal the crumbs
Makes it easier to go
Paralyzed by conscience
Looking for an opening, apathy
As your vocal cords cut out
Never thought once to ask
"How's the temperature?" Too busy with the finer points
Of each struggle we're after
No more, no more will I see you
No more will I see you
No more will I see you
So long since I've seen you
Haven't we both been living the high life
With those on the bottom?
No more, no more will I see you
No more will I see you
No more will I see youEmbed
