Fifteen Keys LyricsWatch it separate into
Whatever the day wants it to
Findin' out that the worst is true
Findin' out that it can escape you
Slings and arrows, completes the score
Always leavin' wantin' more
And I try to throw it away
Silver spikes and mace
Displayed in your eyes
Fearlessness cannot fathom
What's on your mind
Been there, no luck at all
Nothin' left to lose
Been there, no luck at all
Nothin' left to lose
I've been there
'Danger/Slow' sign ahead
Exhaust fumes, Thin Lizzy instead
Left all pressin' cares all along the road
Fifteen keys, but where do they go?
Slings and arrows completes the score
Always leavin' wantin' more
And I try to throw it away
Strings that pull, strings that bend
This song and dance never endsEmbed
