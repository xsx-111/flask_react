Siggimund Blue LyricsWhen I was a young child
My daddy gave to me
The name of Siggimund Blue
He wanted me to grow up
So that everything written
Would in time come true
And I fell
Hitting years by chance
And I recall that I walked
Just smiling to the stake
Singing sha la la
When I was a young child
My heart was on fire
And the air would burst aflame
Flowers were growing
Nothing knowing
Could be just the same
And I loved it
As I always do
And I recall that I walked
Just smiling to the stake
Singing sha la la
Come on now my baby
Come on now my love
This could be forever
Written from above
When I was a young child
My daddy gave to me
The tales of Siggimund Blue
He wanted me to know that
Things surely written
Could in time come true
And I read it
Emerging with each turn
And when I left off the scene
I could sense in a gleam
That I would surely burn burn
Come on now baby
Come on now my love
This could be forever
