Two Tongue Tale LyricsShe said: "Life isn't so fine
After all, let it come if it has
To come" What she meant
Was she couldn't find words
She was sick and tired of the
Tears. She said: "I'll use
Whatever God gave me but now
I haven't got a chance"
Came from the land of desert sand
And the wind blows my way
She was blowing her sombre blue
Horn again with a string tied to
The back of my hand. She stepped
Right out of a two tongue tale
With a brilliant smile on her face
She said: "Eyes are slaves
Of suspicion they can torture you
To death"
Came from the land of desert sand
And the wind blows my way
Red gleams of a bloodnight darkly
Cold, cold whisper touched my ears
And I guess that's where I left
Her. Wild, wild shivers drew
Us near. Yes, I guess that's where
I left her. By the light of these eyesEmbed
