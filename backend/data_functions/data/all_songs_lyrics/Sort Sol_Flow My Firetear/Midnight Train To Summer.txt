Midnight Train To Summer LyricsIt's still in the night
Of some early spring delight
I went wild in the woods
Had to leave as soon as I could
Here comes the midnight train to summer
Here comes the midnight train to summer
Small pearls of dew
Was it all the green grass knew
In my land of snow
Only darkness grows
Here comes the midnight train to summer
Here comes the midnight train to summer
Go on! Go on!
I'm waving it all farewell
I wrote my song
And I'm ready to go
It's still in the night
Of some early spring delight
I'm going to the land of the sun
I'm going to be the only one
Here comes the midnight train to summer
Here comes the midnight train to summerEmbed
