Dyanne Thorne LyricsWell it is her
Blond hair, white skin
Eyes and pearls
Standing tall
Now she is hurt
Shiny cars
Blond hair, white skin
Must be her
She's on walls
She's in dreams
I sleep beneath her snow white streams
Dyanne Thorne - Keeper of the Harem girls
Dyanne Thorne - Magic splinter gleams
Dyanne Thorne - How can I break your heart
It is her
She's got me down
To praise the ground
That she walks upon
Baby love
She's reduced me
To the flesh and bones
I always knew I was
And I pray every day
That the world will explode
If I don't get her
Dyanne Thorne - Keeper of the Harem girls
Dyanne Thorne - Magic splinter gleams
Dyanne Thorne - How can I break your heartEmbed
