Daughter Of Sad LyricsNight crawls along like some lullaby
Crimson darkness wash your tired eyes
Into the secret house you're thrown
Can you tell or are you on your own
Daughter Of Sad - I wanna know!
Daughter Of Sad - I wanna know!
Down on mercury road you go
The blade is in your hand but you don't know
Out of the secret house you're thrown
What are you doing there all alone
Daughter Of Sad - Speak to me!
Daughter Of Sad - Speak to me!
Unknown fires took you away
From it's golden grip your body sways
Into the secret house you're thrown
Cannonballs and fireworks down belowEmbed
