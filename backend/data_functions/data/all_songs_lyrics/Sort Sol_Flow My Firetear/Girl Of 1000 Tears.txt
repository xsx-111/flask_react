Girl Of 1000 Tears LyricsShe is a girl of 1000 tears
She cries and cries
All night long
Her tears flow down the street and the stairs
They flow and they flow
One day they'll reach the Rhine, hurray
From Aachen to Turkey hey hey
She went to the river
And laid herself down
The water is alive
And roaring with sound
It said baby please
Come flow along
It said baby please
Come flow along
In 1000 years she went away
Over the fields of snow
To the river bay
She is a girl of 1000 tears
She cries and cries and cries
All night long
She went to the river
And laid herself down
The water is alive
And roaring with sound
It said baby please
Come flow along
It said baby please
Come flow alongEmbed
