Tatlin Tower LyricsAs we lie on this bed of roses
We can see it rise in the distance
A tall and beautiful tower
Vladimir Tatlin meant to be the 7th wonder
The 7th wonder of the world
So here lie 10,000 roses
In rotten petrol fumes
The cruel, cruel tower of Timur
Every inch of human flesh into the 7th wonder
The 7th wonder of the worldEmbed
