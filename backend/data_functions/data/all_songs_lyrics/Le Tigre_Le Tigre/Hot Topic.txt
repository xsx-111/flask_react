Hot Topic Lyrics
Hot topic is the way that we rhyme
Hot topic is the way that we rhyme
Hot topic is the way that we rhyme
Hot topic is the way that we rhyme

Carol Rama and Eleanor Antin
Yoko Ono and Carolee Schneemann
"Yr getting old", that's what they'll say
But don't give a damn I'm listening anyway

Stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)
Don't you stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)
I can't live if you stop (One step behind the drum style)
Don't you stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)

Gretchen Phillips and Cibo Matto
Leslie Feinberg and Faith Ringgold
Mr. Lady, Laura Cottingham
Mab Segrest and The Butchies, man

Don't stop (One step behind the drum style)
Don't you stop (One step behind the drum style)
We won't stop (One step behind the drum style)
Don't you stop (One step behind the drum style)
So many rules and so much opinion
So much shit to give in, give in to
So many rules and so much opinion
So much bullshit but we won't give in

Stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)
We won't stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)
Don't you stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)
I can't live if you stop

Tammy Rae Carland and Sleater-Kinney
Vivienne Dick and Lorraine O'Grady
Gayatri Spivak and Angela Davis
Laurie Weeks and Dorothy Allison

Stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)
Don't you stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)
Please don't stop (One step behind the drum style)
We won't stop (Hot topic is the way that we rhyme)
