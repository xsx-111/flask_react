My My Metrocard Lyrics
Off the pillow and into the air
I’m ready ‘cause it’s my day
Situation: it’s all possible
Everything is going my way

My, my Metrocard
My, my Metrocard
My, my Metrocard
Think they’ll go a little
But they're gonna go far!

Oh, fuck! Giuliani!
He’s such! A fucking jerk
Shut down! All the stripbars
Workfare! Does not work

My, my Metrocard
My, my Metrocard
My, my Metrocard
Think they’ll go a little
But they're gonna go far!
Next stop! Atlantic Avenue
Next stop! Christopher Street
Next stop! Transfer to the
Next stop! A, C or E

My, my Metrocard
My, my Metrocard
My, my Metrocard
Think they’ll go a little
But they're gonna go far!

Next stop! Atlantic Avenue
Next stop! Christopher Street
Next stop! Transfer to the
Next stop! A, C or E

My, my Metrocard
My, my Metrocard
My, my Metrocard
Think they’ll go a little
But they're gonna go far!Embed
