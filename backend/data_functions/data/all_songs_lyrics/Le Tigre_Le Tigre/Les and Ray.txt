Les and Ray Lyrics
Nine years old and climbing out the house
Through a song played on piano
By my neighbors, Les and Ray
I put my head up against the wall
To be closer to the music that they played

You were my oxygen
The thing that made me think I could escape
This is a thank you song for Les and Ray

You were my batteries
The thing that made me think I could escape
Here's a song for Les and
Here's a song for Les and RayEmbed
