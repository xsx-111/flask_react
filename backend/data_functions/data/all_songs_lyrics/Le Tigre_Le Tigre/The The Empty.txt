The The Empty Lyrics
The stars are getting in and out of automobiles
And we keep wondering when we're gonna feel something real
Keep waiting for a Santa that'll never come
A real party, not just people who're faking fun
But everything gets erased before it's even said
And all that glitters isn't gold when, inside it's dead

All that glitters is not gold
All that glitters is not gold
All that glitters is not gold
All that glitters is not gold

I went to yr concert and I didn't feel anything (Is not gold)
I went to yr concert and I didn't hear anything (Is not gold)
I went to yr concert and I didn't feel anything (Is not gold)
I went to yr concert and I didn't see anything (Is not gold)

(Oh! Baby!) Why won't you talk to me?
(Oh! Baby!) You must want me empty!
(Oh! Baby!) You don't say anything!
(Oh! Baby!) Why won't you answer me?
All that glitters is not gold (Answer me!)
All that glitters is not gold (Answer me!)
All that glitters is not gold (Answer me!)
All that glitters is not gold (Answer me!)

I sat through yr movie but I didn't see anything (All that glitters is not gold)
I went to yr comedy club and didn't laugh at all (All that glitters is not gold)
I went to yr movie and I didn't hear anything (All that glitters is not gold)
I went to yr concert and there was nothing going on (All that glitters is not gold)

(Oh! Baby!) Why won't you talk to me?
(Oh! Baby!) You don't say anything!
(Oh! Baby!) Why won't you talk to me?
(Oh, baby?) You don't say anything!

All that glitters is not gold (Anything!)
All that glitters is not gold (No!)
All that glitters is not gold ( didn't say anything!)
All that glitters is not gold ( didn't say anything!)Embed
