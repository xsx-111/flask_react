Slideshow at Free University Lyrics
We favor the simple expression of the complex thought
We are for the large shape, because it has the impact of the unequivocal
We are for flat forms because they destroy illusion and reveal truth
The artist was attempting to make art more than something to just look at
They wanted it something to be involved in, something too big to ignore
It is our function as artists to make the spectator to see the world our way, not his way1Embed
