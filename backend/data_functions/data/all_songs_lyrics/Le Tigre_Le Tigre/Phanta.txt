Phanta Lyrics
(On the morning of June 14, 1968, a group of hippies fled into the mountains of Colorado to wait for doomsday.)

4 months + 8 days, been waiting here
Transporter broken, horizon's clear
(Day 1)
No vegetation, blips on my screen
Whatever was here has been disappeared

Now here's alright
Now here's alright
Alright

(Day 2)
Wait tower, radar's going off
I see a small creature who can barely walk
My data says "large" but what I see is small
Text reads "Big Danger" this just looks tired

Now here's alright
Now here's alright
Alright
Alright
(Day 3)
Come in, tower, all our data's wrong
Research inconsistent, we misread it all
There was no monster, and what's left is near dead
Control killed a phantom from inside their heads

(Come in, come in.)
Now here's alright (You've lost my screen. Do you respond?)
Nowhere's alright (Variable text field is frozen.)
Alright (Look at your monitors. Don't take your eyes off the monitor.)
Alright (We're losing you!)
Alright (Subterra outpost, stay calm! We're losing you!)
Al- (You're going-)Embed
