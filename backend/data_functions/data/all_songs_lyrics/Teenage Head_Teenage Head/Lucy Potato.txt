Lucy Potato LyricsSee my Lucy Potato
She's the girl that I gotta rape
See my Lucy Potato
She's the girl that I gotta date
Yeah
Lucy Potato
Oh yeah
Lucy Potato
CHORUS
One time two times
Ringing that phone
Three times four times
Nobody home
Socially that chick's rejected
Intellectually demented
Looks real nice with her pink dress on
She's always drunk she's a lot of fun
Yeah
Lucy Potato
Oh oh yeah
I wanna date
CHORUS
See my Lucy Potato
She's that girl that I gotta date
See my Lucy Potato
She's that girl that I gotta mate
Yeah
Lucy Potato
Oh Yeah
Lucy Potato
CHORUS
Lucy comes chap, chap, chap at my door
Lucy comes tap, tap, tap at my door
Lucy comes knock, knock, knock on my door
Lucy comes tap, tap, tap on my doorEmbed
