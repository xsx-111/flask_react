Picture My Face LyricsSome day you'll remember me
And picture my face
Some day you may smile at me
And I'll walk away
Yesterday I needed a buck
Today I need a bank
But I know who was always there
It's me I have to thank
And I wanna say
Picture my face
I gotta say
Picture my face
Well someday you'll remember me
And picture my face
Some day you may smile at me
And I'll walk away
Yesterday I needed love
Today I need some hate
But I know who was always there
Now baby it's too late
And I wanna say
Picture my face
I gotta say
Picture my face
I need somebody new
Just like you
I need somebody true
I want somebody new
Just like you
I need somebody newEmbed
