Top Down LyricsI wanna get myself a cadillac
One that's really slick
Well I'll be driving through your country
I'll be picking up all your chicks
CHORUS
Top down
In the sun
I wanna have fun
Top down
Well I bought this car to improve my chances
Everybody's looking at me
Well now my name is Lance Romance
Baby won't you take a chance
Well I'll be driving through your cities
I'll be driving through your town
Well everybody's gonna look at me
I'll be driving with my top downEmbed
