Skin Her Alive LyricsHaunted by my conscience
Living my life in hell
Didn't fucking hesitate
When I moved in for the kill
Screams echoed in the distance
And I cannot ignore
Smiling at the memories
When I slaughtered the whore
Skin her alive
Time has come to confess
I did it for the thrill
I would never had dreamt of
That it would be so nice to kill
Blood colours my thoughts
Slipping out of time
Murder is my crime
Skin her fucking aliveEmbed
