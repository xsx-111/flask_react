Dismembered Lyrics
Dismembered...

Brutal orgy of flesh
A carnal feast for our lord
Feel your life float away
As I revel in your blood
Maggots crawl in your flesh
Your life is ending here
Terribly maiming your corpse
Rotting pieces here and there

The loss of your life is now a fact
Dead, eternal hell, awaits
Rotting soul now dies

Innocent soul dismembered
A trophy to our lord
Enter the dark regions
And suffer a thousands deaths
You pray for eternal life
But your cries are denied
As you pray to your God
I spit on your grave
Slaughter remains
Enter my ways
Descend to hell
Llewd yllanrete ll'eW
Suffer a thousand deaths
Like the rest you all will die
Cast into the pits of hell

The loss of your life is now a fact
Dead, eternal hell, awaits
Rotting soul now diesEmbed
