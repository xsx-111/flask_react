Override of the Overture LyricsOverride the overture
Behold the overwhelming power
Trampled and fucking mangled
By the hordes of terror
The process of death is our fate to be
From the skies blood drips like rain
Tell me how I suffer, tell me how I'll die
My arms stretched out in eternal pain
The life that we knew drowned in the stream of death
The agony within tears my worthless being
Crushed
By the blasphemous horror inside
Enter a world
Beyond this fucking global tomb
Mesmerized
By the visions of things past and gone
My death arrives
My fate to be it must be done
Laid to rest
Shut my eyes
Live no more
Die a countless times
To the burial ground
Our flesh are bound
Our souls will live on
With the powers beyond
At the end
I'm still so cold inside
Once again
I would like to share my memories of life
Show me
The realm where nothing dies
If such a place exists
Please guide my eyesEmbed
