Sickening Art Lyrics
Twisted thoughts in a shape of death
Blood is staining on my hands
Deranged mind, rotting soul
Homicidal need leads my way
Warped lust, sickly obsessed
Prepare yourself for the end
Blood spurts from the wounds
As I hack my way through your skull

Crunching bones, screams of pain
Violent death after hours of torture
Bloody corpse put away
A garden party on festering human remains

Stewing limbs in the fridge

Severe dismemberment
Psychotic ecstasy
Frenzied disembowelment
An end to your misery
Piles of flesh
Is all that's left
Suffer now
A grotesque death

Severe dismemberment
Psychotic ecstasy
Frenzied disembowelment
An end to your miseryEmbed
