Bleed for Me LyricsSlowly slicing your body
Wondering what's inside
A psychopath addicted to flesh
Now I'm taking your life
Hacking through your organs
Constantly watching your eyes
I gotta see in your mind
What happens when you die
Bleed for me
Let me see you suffer
Die for me
I love to hear you scream
Dreaming of a death so violent
Sanity is Draining from me
I'm forced to murder and slaughter
By the visions inside my head
Laughing as you die
Please make me stop
If blood is what it takes
I'll just let it flow
Bleed for me
Let me see you suffer
Die for me
I love to hear you screamEmbed
