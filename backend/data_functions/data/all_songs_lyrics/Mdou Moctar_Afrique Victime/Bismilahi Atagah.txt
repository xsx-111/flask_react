Bismilahi Atagah LyricsI begin in the name of God
At this moment in time
I begin in the name of God
At this moment in time
In the hope this invocation can save me
I begin in the name of God
At this moment in time
I begin in the name of God
At this moment in time
In the hope this invocation can save me
I didn't know love can be so agonizing
It has pierced deep within my blood
And bones
I begin in the name of God
At this moment in time
I begin in the name of God
At this moment in timе
In the hope this invocation can save mе
Love has become a painful boil in my life
More painful than the sword of my enemy
I begin in the name of God
At this moment in time
I begin in the name of God
At this moment in time
In the hope this invocation can save meEmbed
