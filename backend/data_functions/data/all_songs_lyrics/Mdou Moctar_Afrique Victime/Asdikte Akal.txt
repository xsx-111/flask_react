Asdikte Akal LyricsWhen I think of my homeland
Nostalgia overwhelms me
When I think of my beloved
I revel in her beauty
The desert is a thing of beauty with its
Landscape and wildlife
I love my homeland because its filled with
People so dear to me
When I think of my homeland
Nostalgia overwhelms me
When I think of my beloved
I revel in her beauty
I can go meet my enemy
Without a weapon
I can get through the dark alone
I can walk across the
Desert without water
But I cannot withstand
Not having you
When I think of my homeland
Nostalgia overwhelms me
When I think of my beloved
I revel in her beautyEmbed
