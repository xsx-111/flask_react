Tala Tannam LyricsMy love no matter where I go
You're always on my mind
I treasure you
You know I never want to see you in tears
I used stones to write your name in a heart
Water can never wash it away because it's surrounded by trees
You know I never want to see you in tears
Your laugh pleases me
I adore your eyes and body shape
My love no matter where I go
You're always on my mind
I treasure you
You know I never want to see you in tearsEmbed
