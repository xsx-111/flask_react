Layla LyricsMy people from the town of Chinta
My people from the town of Chinta
There is a gazelle among you
That I love so much
There is a gazelle among you
That I love so much
Layla!
Layla!
That we love, that I love even more
That we love, that I love even more, Layla
I pray our almighty lord
I pray our almighty lord
May he gratify us with a morning rain
Let the trees grow
And the pets flourish
Let the trees grow
And the wild animals flourish
Let us abandon the cities for the bushes
Bring Layla in Cassandra
Let's go under the trees and play guitar
Let's go under the trees and play guitar
Until the stars appear
We would chat until morning
Layla!
Layla!
That we love, that I love even more
That we love, that I love even more, LaylaEmbed
