Chismiten LyricsTo become a better person, you need
To stop being so jealous and insecure
I have observed these qualities and
I'm unimpressed
To become a better person, you need
To stop being so jealous and insecure
I have observed these qualities and
I'm unimpressed
I'm praying to the Almighty One to
Prevent me from taking up such behaviors
To become a better person, you need
To stop being so jealous and insecure
I have observed these qualities and
I'm unimpressedEmbed
