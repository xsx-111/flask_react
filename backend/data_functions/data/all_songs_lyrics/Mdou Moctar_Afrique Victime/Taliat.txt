Taliat LyricsOh poor girl
Oh poor girl
She gave him her heart and he broke it
She gave him her heart and he broke it
Oh poor girl
Oh poor girl
She gave him her heart and he broke it
She gave him her heart and he broke it
Oh she showed her love
She showed her love
But she was disappointed
She was disappointed
Oh poor girl
Oh poor girl
She gave him her heart and he broke it
She gave him her heart and he broke it
I appeal to you Lord, You the almighty
I appeal to you Lord, You the almighty
Preserve me from unrequited love and contempt
Preserve me from unrequited love and contempt
Oh poor girl
Oh poor girl
She gave him her heart and he broke it
She gave him her heart and he broke itEmbed
