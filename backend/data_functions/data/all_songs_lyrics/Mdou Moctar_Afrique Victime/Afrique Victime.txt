Afrique Victime LyricsAfrica is a victim of so many crimes
If we stay silent it will be the end of us
Why is this happening? What is the reason behind this?
My brothers and sisters, tell me why is this happening?
Africa is a victim of so many crimes
If we stay silent it will be the end of us
Why is this happening? What is the reason behind this?
My brothers and sisters, tell me why is this happening?
From prison to Nobel prize. They ceded to Mandela
Africa is a victim of so many crimes
If we stay silent it will be the end of us
Why is this happening? What is the reason behind this?
The wind born in Tunisia spread all over Arabia
Africa is a victim of so many crimes
If we stay silent it will be the end of us
Why is this happening? What is the reason behind this?
Oh Gaddafi, you have left,  to whom have you entrusted Africa?
Africa is a victim of so many crimes
If we stay silent it will be the end of us
Why is this happening? What is the reason behind this?Embed
