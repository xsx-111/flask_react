Tomorrow Morning Lyrics
Well that's all right, if that's all right
Two thousand miles but still that's all right
And that's all right, if that's all right
I'll see you in the morning if that's all right
What would you do if I wrote you a song
Would you give me some loving when I get home?
Or would you be mad at me if I had a hard time
Getting a hold of you? I try all the time

And I'll bet that, you don't know anybody that could be so bad
But if you did you'd be wondering where I'm at
Well I'll be home when tomorrow morning comes

What would you do if I sang you this song?
The connection is bad but that's only the phone
Because when my words kiss your ear, I'll be right there
The message is long because, baby, this is your song


And that's alright because
I'll be home when tomorrow morning come2Embed
