Symbol In My Driveway Lyrics
I've got a symbol in my driveway
I've got a hundred million dollar friends
I've got you a brand new weapon
Lets see how destructive we can be
I've got a brand new set of stencils
I've been connecting all the dots
Got my plans in a zip lock bag
Lets see how unproductive we can be
I've got a light bulb full of anger
And I can switch it on and off
In situations it can be so bright
I can't believe, how pathetic we can be
I've got a perfect set of blueprints
I'm going to build somebody else
Might cost a little more than money
But what's man without his wealth?
I've got a phosphorescent secret
But don't you tell nobody else
Next thing you know, the whole world
Will be talking about all the clues they got
They're just no use, they've got us fooledEmbed
