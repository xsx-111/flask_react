Rodeo Clowns Lyrics
Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music

Bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of
So many people, so many problems, so many reasons
To buy another round, drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man, better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
When nobody understands, he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing, the women keep on dancing
With the clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down
Yeah, yeah
The Rodeo Clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down
The disco ball spinning, all the music and the women and
The shots of Tequila, man they'll say that they need ya
But what they really need, is just a little room to breath
Teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands
Her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things
Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Man I thought that you heard
Yeah, yeah
The changes occurred
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a part of the herd
Lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground
You walk by look at him but he can't look at you, yeah
You might feel pity but he only feels the ground
You understand moods, but he only knows let down
By the corner there's another one
Reaching out a hand, coming from a broken man, well
You try to live but he's done trying
Not dead but definitely dying
With the rest of the clowns
Yeah, yeah
Mm, mm, mm, mmm, mm, mmm, mm
With the rest of the clowns

Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music2Embed
