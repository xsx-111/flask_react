Dreams Be Dreams Lyrics
She's just waiting for the summertime when the weathers fine
She could hitch a ride out of town
And so far away from that low down good for nothing mistake making fool
With excuses like baby that was a long time ago
But that's just a euphemism if you want the truth he was out of control
But a short times a long time when your mind just won't let it go

Well, summer came along and it then was gone and so was she
Not from him because he followed her just to let her know
A dream's a dream
And all this living's so much harder than it seems
But girl don't let your dreams be dreams
You know this living's not so hard as it seems
Don't let your dreams be dreams
Your dreams your dreams be dreamsEmbed
