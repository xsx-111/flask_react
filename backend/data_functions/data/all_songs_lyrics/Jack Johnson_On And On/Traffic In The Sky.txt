Traffic In The Sky Lyrics
There's traffic in the sky
And it doesn't seem to be getting much better
There's kids playing games on the pavement
Drawing waves on the pavement
Shadows of the planes on the pavement

Its enough to make me cry
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
Maybe its a dream and if I scream
It will burst at the seams
Whole place will fall to pieces
And then they'd say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well

Puzzle pieces in the ground
No one ever seems to be digging
Instead they're looking up towards the heavens
With their eyes on the heavens
The shadows on the way to the heavens
Its enough to make me cry
That don't seem like it would make it feel better
The answers could be found
We can learn from diggin' down
But no one ever seems to be diggin'
Instead they'll say

Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well

Words of wisdom all around
But no one ever seems to listen
They're talking about their plans on the paper
Building up from the pavement
The shadows from the scrapers on the pavement

Its enough to make me sigh
But that don't seem like it would make it feel better
The words are all around
But the words are only sounds
And no one ever seems to listen
Instead they'll say
Well how could we have known?
I'll tell them it's not so hard to tell
No no no
If you keep on adding stones
Soon the water will be lost in the well
Lost in the well4Embed
