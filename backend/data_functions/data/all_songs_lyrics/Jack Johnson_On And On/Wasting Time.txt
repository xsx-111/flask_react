Wasting Time Lyrics
And I'm just a waste of her energy
And she's just a waste of my time, mmhmmm
So why don't we get together
And we could waste everything tonight
And we could waste and we could waste it all tonight
Yeah, and we could waste and we could waste it all tonight

And I don't pretend to know what you know, nah, nah
Now please don't pretend to know what's on my mind
If we already knew everything that everybody knows
We would have nothing to learn tonight
And we would have nothing to show tonight

Oh, but everybody thinks that everybody knows
About everybody else, nobody knows
Anything about themselves
Because they're all worried about everybody else, yeah
Oh

And love's just a waste of our energy, yeah
And life's just a waste of our time
So why don't we get together
And we could waste everything tonight
And we could waste and we could waste it all tonight
Yeah, and we could waste and we could waste it all
Yeah, but everybody thinks that everybody knows
About everybody else, nah, nah, nobody knows
Anything about themselves
Because they're all worried about everybody else, yeah
Oh

And we could waste1Embed
