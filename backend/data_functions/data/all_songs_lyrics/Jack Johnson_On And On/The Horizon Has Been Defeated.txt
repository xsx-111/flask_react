The Horizon Has Been Defeated Lyrics
The horizon has been defeated
By the pirates of the new age
Alien casinos
Well, maybe it's just time to say
That things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The troubles just seems to stay

Future complications
In the strings between the cans
But no prints can come from fingers
If machines become our hands
And then our feet become the wheels
And then the wheels become the cars
And then the rigs begin to drill
Until the drilling goes too far

Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade, fade, fade
Fade away
Thingama jigsaw puzzled
Anger, don't you step too close
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with fancy shoes
Hallelujah zig-zag nothing
Misery it's on the loose
Because people are lonely and only
Animals with too many tools
That can build all the junk that we sell
Ah, sometimes man, make you want to yell

Things can go bad
And make you want to run away
But as we grow older
The horizon begins to fade away
Fade away

Fade, fade, fade
Fade, fade, fade1Embed
