Gone Lyrics
Look at all those fancy clothes
But these could keep us warm just like those
And what about your soul? Is it cold?
Is it straight from the mold, and ready to be sold?
And cars and phones and diamond rings
Bling, bling, because those are only removable things
And what about your mind? Does it shine?
Are there things that concern you, more than your time?

Gone, going, gone
Everything, gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds, when they don’t wanna sing
Gone, people, all awkward with their things
Gone

Look at you, out to make a deal
You try to be appealing, but you lose your peel
And what about those shoes you’re in today?
They’ll do no good, on the bridges you burnt along the way
Are you willing to sell anything?
Gone, with your herd
Leave your footprints
And we’ll shame them with our words
Gone, people, all careless and consumed, gone
Gone, going, gone
Everything, gone, give a damn
Gone be the birds, if they don’t wanna sing
Gone, people, all awkward with their things
