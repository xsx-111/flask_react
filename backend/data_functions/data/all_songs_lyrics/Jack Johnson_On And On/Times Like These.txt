Times Like These Lyrics
In times like these
In times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes
And it always goes on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on it goes
Mhmm, mhm, mhmm

And there's always been laugh and cry and birth and die
And boys and girls with hearts that take and give and break
And heal and grow and recreate and raise and nurture
But then hurt at times

In times like these
In times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes

And there will always be stop and go and fast and slow
Action,Reaction, sticks and stones and broken bones
Those for peace and those for war
And God bless these ones, not those ones
But these ones make
Times like these
And times like those
What will be, will be
And so it goes
And it always goes on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on it goes
Mhmm, mhm, mhmm

But somehow I know it won't be the same
Yeah, somehow I know it'll never be the sameEmbed
