Taylor Lyrics
They say Taylor was a good girl
Never one to be late
Complain express ideas in her brain
Working on the night shift
Passing out the tickets
You're going to have to pay her
If you want to park here
Well mommy's little dancer has
Quite a little secret
Working on the streets now
Never going to keep it
It's quite an imposition
And now she's only wishing
That she would have listened
To the words they said
Poor Taylor

Well she just wanders around unaffected by the winter winds, yeah
And she'll pretend that
She's somewhere else so far and clear about 2,000 miles from here

Well Peter Patrick pitter patters on the window
And Sunny Silhouette won't let him in
And poor old Pete's got nothing because he's been falling
But somehow Sunny knows just where he's been
He thinks that singing on a Sunday's going to save his soul
But now that Saturday's gone
Well sometimes he thinks that he's on his way
But I can see, that his brake lights are on
And he just wanders around unaffected by the winter winds, yeah
And he'll pretend that
Well he's somewhere else so far and clear about 2,000 miles from here

She's such a tough enchilada
Filled up with nada
Giving what you going to give to get a dollar bill
She used to be a limber chick
Time's been ticking
Now she's finger licking to the man
With the money in his pocket
Flying in his rocket
Only stopping by on his way to a better world

If Taylor finds a better world
Then Taylor's going to run awayEmbed
