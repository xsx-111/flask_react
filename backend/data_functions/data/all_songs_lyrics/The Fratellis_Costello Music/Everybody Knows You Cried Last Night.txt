Everybody Knows You Cried Last Night Lyrics
Whistle for the boys, now don't be shy
Give us all a song and a reason why
Baby got the bones and a hand me down
Says her heart is black but her eyes are brown
Give the boys a flash and they'll love you so
Give the girl some cash cause your mother said so
And take 'em out to look at the queen
And any old girl who's in between

Lay yourself down by the side of the bed
Oh you naughty girl you know you tickle me red
You look so dumb and you sound so twee
And you can only wish that you was married to me

Well, that's what you get
Oh, don't get upset
Ridiculous you
Waiting in the queue, oh whoopee doo
You could have been
The best that I've seen
Under the red light
Everybody knows you cried last night
Give us all a go till your face turns red
Little Greg said you went home instead
If you stick around you'll get an alibi
And we'll try and keep your pretty face bone dry
Rent a honey, rent a honey, one two three
Keeping all the boys from your door can't be easy
Well, Ruby said you was wrecked
But you were never well behaved the last time I checked

Lay yourself down by the side of the bed
Oh, you naughty girl, you know you tickle me red
You look so dumb and you sound so twee
And you can only wish that you were married to me

Well, that's what you get
Oh, don't get upset
Ridiculous you
Waiting in the queue, oh whoopee doo
You could have been
The best that I've seen
Under the red light
Everybody knows you cried last night
Lay yourself down by the side of the bed
Oh, you naughty girl, you know you tickle me red
You look so dumb and you sound so twee
And you can only wish that you were married to me

Well, that's what you get
Oh, don't get upset
Ridiculous you
Waiting in the queue, oh whoopee doo
You could have been
The best that I've seen
Under the red light
Everybody knows you cried last night
Everybody knows you cried last night2Embed
