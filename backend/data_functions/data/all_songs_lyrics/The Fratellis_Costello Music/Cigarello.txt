Cigarello LyricsEverybody's giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be their side show
A brown and yellow cigarello dancing under your window
Filthy rag dolls in the bed
I can't listen to what they said
Don't get silly, don't get so sick
Get some trousers and get some quick
All the wasters they come in threes
Honey that's no excuse to tease
Is this your house, do you live here?
You're not as sick as you appear
In the day though you're dumb in a way
Everybody's giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be their side show
A brown and yellow cigarello dancing under your window
Can we watch movies on your TV?
Don't have to get dressed just for me
We could stay home and get drunk quick
I could wear your dress and your lipstick
Or we could go out and steal a car
Both get loaded and drive real far
Is this your house, do you live here?
You're not as thick as you appear
In the day though you're dumb in a way
Everybody's giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be their side show
A brown and yellow cigarello dancing under your window
And everybody's giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be their side show
A brown and yellow cigarello dancing under your window
And everybody's giving me a hand me down
For my cigarello of yellow and brown
Everybody wants me to be their side show
A brown and yellow cigarello dancing under your windowEmbed
