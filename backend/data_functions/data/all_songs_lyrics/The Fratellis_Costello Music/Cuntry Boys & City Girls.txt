Cuntry Boys & City Girls Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4, 5

I said, I don't get out too much, I said
She said, you said, I said two times instead
I said, don't, please, please, please, no
You're just not funny, you know
So stick around here for a week or three or four
I passed out one time by your door
It was twenty to four but I just can't be sure

Cinderella, Cinderella she's my very kind of fella
Part right, half wrong, oh you know it won't be too long, oh yeah
And, oh you know, we country boys are only after sex and noise
Take me, shake me, I'm a real mess, oh yes
I love the way you city girls dress
Even though your head's in a mess

Well, it was some kind of house by some kind of road
With some kind of peculiar dress code
All the boys had no style, not one girl did she smile
I said you're making me itch, she said don't
I said I'll try my best, she said I know that you won't
But it's time to go home while I was chewing her bone
Baby doll, baby doll, climbing on the bedroom wall
Got no real friends at all, maybe she's a mother or two
But I think she's into you
Take me home, take me home, call my mother on the phone
Ella was her name when I left, but now she is Rose
She got no fingers or toes
She lost them everywhere that she goes, now

Lost them everywhere that she goes now
Lost them everywhere that she goes now
Lost them everywhere that she goes now

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Woo!

Cinderella, Cinderella she's my very kind of fella
Part right, half wrong, oh you know it won't be too long, oh yeah
And, oh you know, we country boys are only after sex and noise
Take me, shake me, I'm a real mess, oh yes
I love the way you city girls dress

Baby doll, baby doll, climbing on the bedroom wall
Got no real friends at all, maybe she's a mother or two
But I think she's into you
Take me home, take me home, call my mother on the phone
Ella was her name when I left, but now she is Rose
She got no fingers or toes
She lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goes, now
Lost them everywhere that she goesEmbed
