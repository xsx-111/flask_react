Vince the Loveable Stoner LyricsNow Vince was a loner, a lovable stoner
He lived in a Bluebird, spelled his name backwards
He's so pretty, he always looks shitty
Born on a Monday, such a very good day
And I haven't seen a pupil in his eyes for sixteen days
The Catholic girls love him in a hundred million different ways
An he's been up for days
In a thick malaise
He's only listening to the salad days
Rock a honey rock a honey woo hoo
Sleeps all day and he dreams of you
Rock a honey rock a honey wee hee
Dines in the city where the girls are free
Now Vince got a big crush on the girl from Redrush
He took her out for tacos, said she liked burritos
And he said she's so easy, brought up in the country
She gets naked for a living, she ain't afraid of giving
And I haven't seen a pupil in his eyes for sixteen days
The Catholic girls love him in a hundred million different ways
And he's been up for days
In a thick malaise
He's only listening to the salad days
Rock a honey rock a honey woo hoo
Sleeps all day and he dreams of you
Rock a honey rock a honey wee hee
Dines in the city where the girls are free
And I haven't seen a pupil in his eyes for sixteen days
The Catholic girls love him in a hundred million different ways
And he's been up for days
In a thick malaise
He's only listening to the salad days
Rock a honey, rock a honey, woo hoo
Sleeps all day and he dreams of you
Rock a honey, rock a honey, wee hee
Dines in the city where the girls are free
Rock a honey, rock a honey, woo hoo
Sleeps all day and he dreams of you
Rock a honey rock a honey
Sleeps all day and he don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch meEmbed
