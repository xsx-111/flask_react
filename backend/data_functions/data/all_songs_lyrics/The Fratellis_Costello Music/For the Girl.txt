For the Girl LyricsLa la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Well she said, "I know but I just can't tell
Everything that you've just been saying"
Lucy was there as well in the dark
When the kids in the band were playing
No one could hear a word or tell
What the girl was singing
She just must've been 16 or 18
I'm just past caring
She was into the Stones when
I was into the Roses
She was breaking my bones when
I was busting their noses
She would tell me a secret
I would lose it the next day
Young love pleases you easy
Makes you sick in a bad way
And all the while the girl sang
La la la la, she sang
Kickings for my sweetheart
Bruises that I just don't miss
And she said, "I can't love you anymore than this"
Oh, she said, she said, "no no no no"
Then again, "yes, why don't you kill me?"
I said, "wait a minute, stop right there
Sweetheart, you know that don't thrill me"
Said I would've been there if only you had been a little bit nicer
I was dead by Sunday, half dead skint just trying to please her
She was getting me pills when
I was into her best friend
She was chasing the thrills
And living out in the West End
She was pretty in places
I lived under her window
She said, "take me to London
Tell me something I don't know"
And all the while the girl sang
La la la la, she sang
Kickings for my sweetheart
Bruises that I just don't miss
And she said, "I can't love you anymore than this"
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
She was into the Stones when
I was into the Roses
She was breaking my bones when
I was busting their noses
She would tell me a secret
I would lose it the next day
Young love pleases you easy
Makes you sick in a bad way
And all the while the girl sang
La la la la, she sang
Kickings for my sweetheart
Bruises that I just don't miss
And she said, "I don't like you
You can't stand me
I can't love you anymore than this"5Embed
