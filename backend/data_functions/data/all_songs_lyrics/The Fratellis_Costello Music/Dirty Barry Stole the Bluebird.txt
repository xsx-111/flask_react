Dirty Barry Stole the Bluebird LyricsHe stole it, he stole it
He crossed the wires
And flipped the bastard
He rigged it, he rigged it
His face was ugly
And not so much as a hello or yellow
His favourite colour was black because he stole it, he stole it, he stole it, he stole it
And one fine day, now
It was typical
I was wonderful
He was critical
He lived down my street
Owned a Jaguar
No matter where you are
That’s a girlies car
All around you
He never seen a word
He's always out of work
He's never seen a word
Got no gyro
He didn’t need it though
He stole cars, ya know
Though he had the sneakiness to lie
Such a lazy way to die
Didn’t try
Well oh my
And all the girls were weepin when we said
That their bluebird days were dead
Go to bed
Oh instead
He stole it, he stole it
He crossed the wires
And flipped the bastard
He rigged it, he rigged it
His face was ugly
And not so much as a hello or yellow
His favourite colour was black because he stole it, he stole it, he stole it, he stole it
And we chased him right down
From the batting cage
So we could catch him up
Smash his pretty face
Bang bang bang bang
Where the bluebird at
We were getting tanned
By an arm's band
We sped away
Past the studio
The cigarillo
And the fratellio
We got wasted
Then we went to bed
Got the train instead
Though he had the cheekiness to lie
Such a lazy way to die
Didn’t try
Well oh my
(well oh my)
And all the girls were weepin when we said
That their bluebird days were dead
Were dead
Oh instead
Oh instead
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
He stole it, he stole it
He crossed the wires
And flipped the bastard
He rigged it, he rigged it
His face was ugly
And not so much as a hello or yellow
His favourite colour was black because he stole it, he stole it, he stole it, he stole it
He swiped it, he swiped it
And we don’t care because we got us a payroll and banjo
And they can't drive us nowhere, no words, no hello or yellow
His favourite colour was black because he stole it, he stole it, he stole it, he stole it
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
La la-la, la la-la
La la-la, LaaaaaEmbed
