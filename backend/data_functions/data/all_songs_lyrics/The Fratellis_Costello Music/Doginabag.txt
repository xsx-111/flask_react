Doginabag LyricsWell you got it so good
You live for the action
Used to be a has been
Now you got yourself some satisfaction
A dog in a bag and a bone
But you're lost in the rain 21 million miles from home
You got brand new shoes
A healthy fixation
Atomic heart
And a two for one education
You're breaking my heart all the way
With your dog in a bag I need your badness just to get through the day
It's a million o'clock, too hot to sleep
A rotten taste in my mouth and my eyes are deep
There's nothing much really going on up here
I'm holding on for dear life and one more beer
I guess you could say it's a sick little show
A bottle of troubles and a bed full of woe
It's easy to see without looking too far
You'd have to be a saint to be as sick as you are
Half the world's asleep
The rest of them are dreaming
God forbid if you forget to close the door as you're leaving
I hate to see you in a bind
With your dog in a bag
Sleeping next to your ridiculous mind
With a dog in a bag
Sleeping next to your ridiculous mind
With a dog in a bag
Sleeping next to your ridiculous mindEmbed
