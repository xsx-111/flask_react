Got Ma Nuts From a Hippie LyricsWell, I met her in a bar
The men with big guitars were playin'
And I listened with my ears
But I couldn't hear what she was sayin'
I guess she talked with her mind
But I didn't want to seem too unkind so I just laughed
And kept my eyes peeled to the door
Wondering what I was there for
But its alright, and its alright
And its alright, and its alright
I got ma nuts from a hippy
In a camper van on Saturday night
Well, I asked if she believed
In Adam and Eve, the fable
And I guess she would've given me an answer
If only she was able
And she danced like a medicine man
Drew a crazy picture on my hand and told me
She wanted to change my point of view
Asked me where I was going to
But its alright, and its alright
And its alright, and its alright
I got ma nuts from a hippy
In a camper van on Saturday night
Well, she whispered in my ear
We got to get us out of here to the country
I asked her for a ride she took me aside
She said, try me
I thought I'm gonna wake pretty soon
In the middle of a Sunday afternoon just dreamin'
And it was warm in the back of her van
When she made me a real man
She made me cry
She made me cry
She made me cry
She made me cry
But its alright, and its alright
And its alright, and its alright
I got ma nuts from a hippy
In a camper van on Saturday night
I got ma nuts from a hippy
In a camper van on Saturday night
I got ma nuts from a hippy
In a camper van on Saturday night
I got ma nuts from a hippy
In a camper van on Saturday nightEmbed
