Famous Groupies Lyrics
All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me

Behold the famous groupies, they are alike as two peas
And where the other goes, the other goes
But though the famous groupies are only paid in rupees
Nobody knows what the famous groupies know
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go

There was a bongo player who kept an extra layer
Of Dunlopillo mattress in his van
But when the famous groupies arrived with their twin snoopies
Nobody saw which way the poor boy ran
As nobody does it like a famous groupie can

All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies for me

There was a lead guitarist who lived in Epping Forest
And all he ever wanted was to blow
(Who knows why but)
But when the girls were with him he never lost his rhythm
'Cause nobody knows what the famous groupies know
(alright, girls?)
And nobody goes where the famous groupies go
There was the classic story of a roadie nicknamed Rory
Who used to practice voodoo on the side
But when the famous twosome suggested something gruesome
All that they found was a crater two miles wide
Which left the music business absolutely horrified

All stand back, let the people see
Take a snap of the famous groupies

Ladies and gentlemen, those magnificent examples of female pulchritude and luminosity, direct from their global perambulations to the very boards of this supremely magnificent proscenium arch
Ladies and gentlemen I give you, famous groupies!Embed
