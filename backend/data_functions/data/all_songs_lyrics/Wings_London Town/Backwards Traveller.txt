Backwards Traveller Lyrics
Hey, did you know that I'm
Always going back in time
Rhyming slang, "Auld Lang Syne", my dears
Through the years

I am the backwards traveller
Ancient wool unraveller
Sailing songs, wailing on the moon
I am the backwards traveller
Ancient wool unraveller
Sailing songs, wailing on the moon

And we were sailing songs, wailing on the moon
We were wailing on the moonEmbed
