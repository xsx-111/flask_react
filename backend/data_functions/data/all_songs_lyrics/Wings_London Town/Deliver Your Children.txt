Deliver Your Children Lyrics
Well, the rain was a-failing, and the ground turned to mud
I was watching all the people running from the flood
So I started to praying, though I ain't no praying man
For the Lord to come-a-helping, knowing He'd understand

Deliver your children to the good good life
Give 'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong, you'd better make it right

Well, I had me a woman, she was good and clean
She spent all the day with the washing machine
But when it come to loving, she was never around
She was out getting dirty all over town

Deliver your children to the good good life
Give 'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong, you'd better make it right

Well, I was low on money, and my truck broke down
I was on my way to the lost and found
So I took it to a dealer, I said "make it run"
Well, I ain't got no money, but I got me a gun
I said you robbed me before, so I'm robbing you back
And if it don't put you straight, it'll put you on the right track
Well, I ain't no devil, and I ain't no saint
But I can tell a dealer by the colour of his paint

Deliver your children to the good good life
Give 'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong, you'd better make it right


Deliver your children to the good good life
Give 'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night
And if a thing goes wrong, you'd better make it right

If you want good eggs, you gotta feed that hen
And if you want to hear some more, well, I'll sing it againEmbed
