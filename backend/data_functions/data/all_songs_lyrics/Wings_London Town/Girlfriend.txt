Girlfriend Lyrics
Girlfriend, I'm gonna tell your boyfriend (Yeah)
Tell him exactly what you're doing (Yeah)
Tell him what you do to me
Late at night, when the wind is free
Girlfriend

Girlfriend, I'm gonna show your boyfriend (Yeah)
Show him the letters I've been saving (Yeah)
Show him how you feel inside
And how love couldn't be denied, oh, no
We're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine

Till the river stops a-flowing
Till the wind doesn't wanna blow
Till the flowers stop a-growing
Till my love doesn't wanna know


We're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine
Girlfriend, we'd better tell your boyfriend (Yeah)
Tell him exactly what we're doing (Yeah)
Tell him what he needs to know
Or he may never let you go, oh, no
Yes, we're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine

Till the river stops a-flowing
Till the wind doesn't want to blow
Till the flowers stop a-growing
Till the ocean's a sea of snow
