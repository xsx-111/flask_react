Living in Colour Lyrics
Living in colour, living in colour
I can see the paint on your toes
Living in colour, living
Even in the blackout, I know

I am floating, I, I am floating
With my eyes closed, with no sails
I am soaking, I, I am weathered
By the winter of mixed drinks
Am I dancing, am, am I nervous?
Simply spinning in my own grave
You were asking, you, you were asking
And with two steps, I'm saved

Living in colour, living in colour
I can see the paint on your toes
Living in colour, living
Even in the blackout, I know

Weeks gone by, I was weak
I was paler than a pine box that holds bones
She poked the iris, then she pierced a hole
And watched the colour rush forth
Modern Madonna, who held my head in
Warm hands with pink nails
Mark my mouth, mark mark
Whisper that the sickness will go away

Living in colour, living in colour
I can see the paint on your toes
Living in colour, living
Even in the blackout, I know
Living in colour, living in colour
I can see the paint on your toes
Living in colour, living
Even in the blackout, I know

And though I dreamt with a rapid eye
By day I hope to rapidly die
And have my organs laid on ice
Wait for somebody that would treat 'em right
And as the night started swallowing
You pulled the blood to my blue lips
Forced the life through still veins
Filled my heart with red again
Living in colour, living in colour
I can see the paint on your toes
Living in colour, living
Even in the blackout, I know
Living in colour, living in colour
I can see the paint on your toes
Living in colour, living
Even as I blackout, I knowEmbed
