Yes, I Would Lyrics
My cry for a fistful of sand
Breathes silence
Hold me, I'm folding, I can't see land
The world just blinks
Lead me, I'm stupid from a lesson learned
You've learned nothing
You told me to get lost to find myself

And first it bleeds then it scabs
I feel like a hemophiliac
Would I change if you carried me back?
Oh, oh, yes I would
Believe me now
Yes I would
And I can't sink now
Oh, oh, yes I would

Well, what if I'd never thrown that bone?
And what if this tear in my side just pours and pours and pours?
I wonder if they'd notice that I'm not around
The loss of a lonely man never makes much of a sound
And first it bleeds then it scabs
I feel like a hemophiliac
Would I change if you carried me back?
Oh, oh, yes I would
Believe me now
Yes I would
And I can't sink now
Oh, oh, yes I would
Believe me now
Yes I would
And I can't sink now
Oh, oh, yes I would
Believe me now
Yes I would
And I can't sink now
Oh, oh, yes I would
Believe me now
Yes I would
I just can't sink now
Oh, oh, yes I wouldEmbed
