Nothing Like You Lyrics
This is a story and you are not in it, uh huh
Flock of pages torn out
Here is a bedroom that you've never been in and
Here is your shovel, there's the ground
Look, two lovers covered in covers, uh huh
I can put us to bed tonight
I am bruised but she is dressing my wounds
Night nursing a broken man

She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
But there is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you

After waking up post-operation
I found I had come in a dream again
All the pain, almost as painful as ever but
Something in me was not the same
At night during dreams of submission
I could claw back my heart and soul
As the size of the tumour diminishes
Slowly fill that black hole
She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
But there is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
She was not the cure for cancer
And all my questions still ask for answers
But there is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you

There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you
There is nothing like someone new
And this girl, she was nothing like you, whoaEmbed
