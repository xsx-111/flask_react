FootShooter Lyrics
Well, the booze in my blood runs fast and loud
And my brain shouts down to my mouth
Say whatever I think
Say it at him
And when the dam bursts open
And you're drowned out, boy
Better go outside sit in your boat and wait
Till you get washed away

Hold onto your thumbs
Tighten your eyelids, uh-uh, uhuh
Lock up your ears, my dear
I'm verbal when I am loaded
Duck under that desk
Cover your neck, uh-uh uhuh
Thicken your skin as I begin
To shoot myself in the foot again

And as the body succumbs and my mouth goes numb
I limp out to the sound
Of the breaking of broken toes
A vandal spoke
And in the stark and the sobering dry sunlight
I will blink my eyes and hope the blink can erase
All the shit that I said
And did
Hold onto your thumbs
Tighten your eyelids, uh-uh, uhuh
Lock up your ears, my dear
I'm verbal when I am loaded
Duck under that desk
Cover your neck, uh-uh, uhuh
Thicken your skin as I begin
To shoot myself in the foot again

And if I shoot at you
You should shoot at me, too
And we can drown in pools
Of the thick dark words we threw
And as my face turns white
I apologize, I am sorry
It's not your fault
It's mine

Hold onto your thumbs
Tighten your eyelids, uh-uh, uhuh
Lock up your ears, my dear
I'm verbal when I am loaded
Duck under that desk
Cover your neck, uh-uh uh-uuuh
Thicken your skin as I begin
To shoot myself in the foot againEmbed
