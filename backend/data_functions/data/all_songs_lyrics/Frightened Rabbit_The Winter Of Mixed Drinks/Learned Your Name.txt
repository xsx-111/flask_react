Learned Your Name LyricsI wish I had, I wish I had
Learned your name
But I couldn't read, I couldn't speak
Ah, nobody taught me
Met you when you were full of lemonade
You strode boldly in bold clothes
Covered the fear
Spent four years inside you, day upon day
You pushed colours and borders
Lit by my gaze
Oh, the photograph
The last gasp on steps at the end
Just a tiny glance, all I ask
Amidst all this tension
The old man visits every day
It's barely a love affair
He may love me
But I do not love him
Can I move to where you move?
Dash down the stream
You threw the greed that I gave you
For all you gave me
You've demolished my heart
Whichever room it lived in
Oh, I wish I had, I wish I had
I wish I had learned your nameEmbed
