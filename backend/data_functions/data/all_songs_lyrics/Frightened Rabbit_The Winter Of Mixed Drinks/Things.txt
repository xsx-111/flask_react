Things Lyrics
Well, here's the evidence of human existence
A splitting binbag next to two damp boxes
And I cannot find a name for them
They hardly show that I have lived
And the dust, it settles on these things
Displays my age again
Like a new skin made from old skin
That had barely been lived in

I didn't need these things, I didn't need them, oh
Pointless artifacts from a mediocre past
So I shed my clothes, shed my flesh
Down to the bone and burned the rest
I didn't need these things, I didn't need them, oh
Took them all to bits, turned them outside in
And I left them on the floor
And ran for dear life through the door, oh

Useless objects, they gathered a storm of shit
A dim and silent shedful of your life's supplies
When all you need's a coffin and your Sunday best
To smarten up the end
And at the front gate, what a reward awaits
One bite of loaf from a holy ghost
An eternity of suffering
In the company of all those Christian men

I didn't need these things, I didn't need them, oh
Pointless artifacts from a mediocre past
So I shed my clothes, shed my flesh
Down to the bone and burned the rest
I didn't need these things, I didn't need them, oh
Took them all to bits turned them outside in
And I left them on the floor
And ran for dear life through the door, oh

Never need these things, I'll never need them, oh
It's just you I need, you're my human heat
For the things are only things
And nothing brings me like you bring me, oh
I'll never need these things, I'll never need them, oh
Never going back, so we can drop the past
And we'll leave it on the floor
And run for dear life through the door, ohEmbed
