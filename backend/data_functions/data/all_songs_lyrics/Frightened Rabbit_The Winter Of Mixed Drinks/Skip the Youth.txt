Skip the Youth Lyrics
I've been digging that hole tonight
On my knees beneath the moon
All I need is a place to lie
Guess a grave will have to do
Won't you give me two minutes please?
Just let me cover my eyes
All the hammer and scrape has been chipping away
At the luster of life

So I (move, move)
I would but I am so tired
(Move, move) If I can't shake myself
I can't dance with you

Though my body is far from old
I'm bound to useless youth
And I can't fake a fist to throw
Through the crust of the earth
If you find me, don't wake me
I can't be shaken awake
If you don't stare at the dark, if you never feel bleak
Life starts to lose its taste
So I (move, move)
I would but I am so tired
(Move, move) If I can't shake myself
I can't dance with you

(I hear the drums)
The worn-out beat of a tired heart
(You are young) If this is the prime of life
I wish I could skip the blasted youth

Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too much
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too fast
Skip the youth, it's ageing me too muchEmbed
