The Loneliness and the Scream Lyrics
Can you hear the road from this place?
Can you hear footsteps? Voices?
Can you see the blood on my sleeve?
I have fallen in the forest, did you hear me?

In the loneliness?
Oh, the loneliness
And the scream to prove
To everyone that I exist
In the loneliness
Oh, the loneliness
And the scream to bring
The blood to the front of my face again

Am I here?  Of course I am, yes
All I need is your hand to drag me out again
It wasn't me, I didn't dig this ditch
I was walking for weeks before I fell in

To the loneliness
Oh, the loneliness
And the scream to prove
To everyone that I exist
In the loneliness
Oh, the loneliness
And the scream to fill
A thousand black balloons with air, oh
I fall down, find god
Just to lose it again
Glue the community together
We were hammering it
Fell down, found love
But I can lose it again
But now our communal heart
It beats miles from here
I fall down, find god
Just to lose it again
Glue the community together
We were hammering it
Fell down, found love
But I can lose it again
But now our communal heart
It beats miles from hereEmbed
