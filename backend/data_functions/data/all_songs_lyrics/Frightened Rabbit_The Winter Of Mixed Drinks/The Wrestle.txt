The Wrestle Lyrics
The crumpled ocean is
No boat trip
The dark waters
Stole my clothing

The shape stirs beneath me
A pulse pounds along bloodstreams
The first bite marks the beginning of

The clotheless wrestle
With the clotheless animal

Bare those teeth to me
Please, man eater
You can see all of me
Naked with fear

This is the test I left land for
To grip flesh and pull muscle in
The vice clinch of the struggle
I can't give in to the weight of
The clotheless wrestle
With the clotheless animal

Animal
Animal
Animal

My enemy
Please stay close to me
I've no breath left
You cold breath thief

The last gasp from a burst lung
The fight fathers, the weak son
The last taste of salt in my mouth
My skin breaks with no sound

I'm torn
Limb from limb
There is bone, there is gristle
And spit
In the clotheless wrestle
The clotheless animal

Animal
Animal
