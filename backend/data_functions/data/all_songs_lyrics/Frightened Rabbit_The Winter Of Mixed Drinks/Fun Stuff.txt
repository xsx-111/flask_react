Fun Stuff Lyrics
I took off my clothes, she took off hers too
With no fanfares and no hallelujahs
Throughout the night
I would grind away the truth
That there's nothing sadder than sad, sad sex
And the bad, bad news is that I gave in
To the ugly hand
That first led me away from you

The fun stuff
Is not so fun without you

So I drink until I fill my brim
But there's nothing fills me up the same
As a tiny word
Broadcast across the sea
And should I go out to dance tonight?
Well my two left feet need your two right
Or I'll spin around
In circles endlessly
Well, the fun stuff
Is not so fun without you

Well, the city was born bright blue today
And I whistled through the sunlit streets
And my empty hand
Felt cold and unused
And I'm quite all right, I get by just fine
I'm not depressed, not most of the time
It's just the fun stuff
Is much less fun without you

The fun stuff
Is much less fun without youEmbed
