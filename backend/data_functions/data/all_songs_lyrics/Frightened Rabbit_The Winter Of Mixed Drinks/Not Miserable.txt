Not Miserable Lyrics
Well, this is easier now
I found all the pieces that I lost in the flood
And it wasn't that much
And though it's easier now
I will always remember the night that I almost drowned
All alone in a house

And the love that I lost
With all of the shit that came out in the wash
Just a pocket of fluff
I'm not put upon
I am free of from disease no greys, no liver-spots
Most of the misery's gone, gone, gone to the bone

(I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I am, I am, I am, I am) Not miserable now
(I am, I am, I am, I am) No one knows
(I am, I am, I am, I am) No one knows
(I am, I am, I am, I am) I'm not miserable

So the hymns that I sung
Prayers for the fucked from a bitter, forked tongue
Sing of history now
Though the corners are lit
The dark can return with the flick of a switch
It hasn't turned on me yet, yet
(I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I am, I am, I am, I am) Not miserable now
(I am, I am, I am, I am) No one knows
(I am, I am, I am, I am) No one knows
(I am, I am, I am, I am) I'm not miserable
(I am, I am, I am, I am) Not miserable now
(I am, I am, I am, I am) No one knows
(I am, I am, I am, I am) No one knows
(I am, I am, I am, I am) I'm not miserable

(I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I am, I am, I am, I am)
(I am, I am, I am, I am)Embed
