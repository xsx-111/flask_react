Into My Arms (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
I don't believe in an interventionist God
But I know, darling, that you do
But if I did, I would kneel down and ask Him
Not to intervene when it came to you
Oh, not to touch a hair on your head
Leave you as you are
If He felt He had to direct you
Then direct you into my arms

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

And I don't believe in the existence of angels
But looking at you I wonder, is that true?
But if I did I would summon them together
And ask them to watch out over you
To each burn a candle for you
To make bright and clear your path
And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love
And guide you into my arms
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms

But I believe in love
And I know that you do too
And I believe we can choose our path
That we can walk down, me and you
So keep your candles burning
Make her journey bright and pure
That will keep returning always and evermore

Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my arms, O Lord
Into my armsEmbed
