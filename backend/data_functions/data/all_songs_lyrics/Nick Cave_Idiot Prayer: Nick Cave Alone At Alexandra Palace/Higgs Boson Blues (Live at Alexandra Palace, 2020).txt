Higgs Boson Blues (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
Can't remember anything at all
Can't remember anything at all

Black road long and I drove and drove
Came upon a crossroad
The night was hot and black
I see Robert Johnson with a ten dollar guitar
Strapped to his back looking for a tune
Well, here comes Lucifer with his canon law
And a hundred black babies running from his genocidal jaw
He's got the real killer groove
Robert Johnson and the devil, man
Don't know who's gonna rip off who

I'm driving my car, flame trees on fire
Sitting and singing the Higgs Boson Blues
And I'm tired, I'm tired and I'm looking for a spot to drop
All the clocks have stopped in Memphis
In the Lorraine Motеl, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot
That's why they call it the Hot Spot
Take a room with a viеw
Hear a man preaching in a language that's completely new
Making the hot cots in the flophouse bleed
While the cleaning ladies sob into their mops, and the
Bellhop hops and a-bops
When a shot rings out, it's a spiritual groove
Everybody bleeding to the Higgs Boson Blues
And if I die tonight
Bury me in my favorite yellow patent leather shoes
With a mummified cat and a cone-like hat
That the caliphate forced on the Jews
Can you feel my heartbeat?
Can you feel my heartbeat?
I'm driving my car down to Geneva

Well, Hannah Montana
She does the African Savannah
As the simulated rainy season begins
Oh, she curses the queue at the zoo loos, then
Moves on to Amazonia
And cries with the dolphins
The Mau Mau ate the pygmy
The pygmy ate the monkey
The monkey has a gift and he is sending it back to you
Here come the missionary
With his smallpox and flu
Saving them savages
With his Higgs Boson Blues

Ah, let the damn day break
Rainy days always make me sad
Miley Cyrus floats in a swimming pool in Toluca Lake
And you're the best girl that I've ever had
And you're the very best girl that I've ever had
And you're the best girl that I've ever had
Bar noneEmbed
