Waiting for You (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
All through the night we drove, and the wind caught her hair
And we parked on the beach in the cool evening air
Well, sometimes it's better not to say anything at all
Your body is an anchor, never asked to be free
Wanna stay in the business of making you happy
Well, I'm just waiting for you

Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you

A priest runs through the chapel, all the calendars are turning
As a Jesus freak on the street says, "He is returning"
Well, sometimes a little bit of faith can go a long, long way
Your soul is my anchor, I never asked to be freed
Well, sleep now, sleep now, take as long as you need
'Cause I'm just waiting for you

Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you, waiting for you
Waiting for you to return
To return, to returnEmbed
