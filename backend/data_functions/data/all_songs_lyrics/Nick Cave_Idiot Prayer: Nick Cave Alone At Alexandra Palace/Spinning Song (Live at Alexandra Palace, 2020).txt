Spinning Song (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
Once there was a song, the song yearned to be sung
It was a spinning song about the king of rock 'n' roll
The king was first a young prince, the prince was the best
With his black jelly hair he crashed onto a stage in Vegas

The king had a queen, the queen's hair was a stairway
She tended the castle garden and in the garden planted a tree
The garden tree was a stairway, it was 15 branches high
On the top branch was a nest, sing the high cloudy nest
In the nest there was a bird, the bird had a wing
The wing had a feather, spin the feather and sing the wind

The king in time died, the queen's heart broke like a vow
And the tree returned to the earth with the nest and the bird
But the feather spun upwards, upwards and upwards
Spinning all the weather vanes
Spinning up over the streets
Spinning up over the crowds
Spinning up over the cities
Forever spinning
Well, this prayer is for you my love
Sent on the wings of a dove
Upward and upwardEmbed
