Euthanasia (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) LyricsI look for you underneath the damp earth
I look to you in the night sky
I look to you in underneath the thorn bush
I look for you in the old city
And in looking for you I lost myself
Lost myself in time
Lost myself into the damp earth
Lost myself in the night sky
Lost myself underneath the thorn bush
Lost myself in the old city
And in losing myself I found myself
Found myself in time
Oh, when you stepped out of the vehicle
And attached yourself to my heart
It was a kind of dying
A kind of dying
Dying of time
And I fled from the old city
Fled underneath the thorn bush
Fled into the night sky
Fled underneath the damp earth
Where I passed through a doorway
And found you sitting at the kitchen table
And smiling
That smile that smiles, that smiles
That smile that smiles, that smiles
That smile that smiles, that smiles
Smiles just in timeEmbed
