Galleon Ship (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
If I could sail a galleon ship
Long lonely ride across the sky
Seek out mysteries while you sleep
And treasure money cannot buy

For you know I see you everywhere
A servant girl, an empress
My galleon ship will fly and fall
Fall and fly and fly and fall deep into your loveliness

And if we rise, my love
Before the daylight comes
A thousand galleon ships will sail
Ghostly 'round the morning sun

For we are not alone it seems
So many riders in the sky
The winds of longing in their sails
Searching for the other side

And if we rise, my love
Oh, my darling, precious one
We'll stand and watch your galleon ships
Circle 'round the morning sunEmbed
