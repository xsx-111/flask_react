Girl in Amber (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
Some go and some stay behind, some never move at all
Girl in amber trapped forever, spinning down the hall
Let no part of her go unremembered, clothes across the floor
Girl in amber longs to slumber shuts the bathroom door

The phone, the phone, the phone it rings, the phone it rings no more
The song, the song, the song it spins since 1984
The phone, the phone, the phone it rings, thе phone it rings no more
The song, thе song it's been spinning now since 19—

If you want to bleed, just bleed
If you want to bleed, just bleed
And if you want to leave, don't breathe a word
Just step away
And let the world—

Turn, you turn, you kneel, lace up his shoes, your little blue-eyed boy
Take him by his hand, go move and spin him down the hall
Well, I got lucky, I got lucky and I tried again
I knew the world it would stop spinning now since you've been gone
I used to think that when you died you kind of wandered the world
In a slumber till you crumbled, were absorbed into the earth
Well, I don't think that any more
The phone it rings no more
The song, the song, the song it spins now since 1984
The song, the song, the song it spins and it's been a spinning now
And if you'll hold me I will tell you that you know that

If you want to leave, don't breathe
And if you want to breathe, don't  leave
But if you want to leave, don't breathe a word
Just step away and let the world turn

The song, the song, the song it spins, the song, it spins no more
The phone, the phone it rings and you won't stay

Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me
Don't touch me anymore, anymoreEmbed
