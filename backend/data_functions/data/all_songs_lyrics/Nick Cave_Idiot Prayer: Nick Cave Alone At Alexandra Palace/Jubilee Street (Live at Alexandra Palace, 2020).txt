Jubilee Street (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
On Jubilee Street there was a girl named Bea
She had a history, yeah, but she's got no past
When they shut her down, yeah, well, the Russians moved in
Now I'm too scared, I'm too scared to even walk on past
But here I come up the hill
I'm pushing my wheel of love
I got love in my tummy and a tiny little pain
A ten ton catastrophe on a sixty pound chain
And I'm pushing my wheel of love up Jubilee Street
Well, look at me now, look at me now
Ah, look at me now
Ah, look at me now
Look at me now

The problem was she had a little black book
And my name was written on every page
Yeah, well, a girlâ€™s gotta make ends meet
Especially down on Jubilee Street
I was out of place and time, I was over the hill
I was out of my fucking mind on Jubilee Street
These days I go downtown in my tie and a-tails
I got a fetus, yeah, on a leash
I am alone now, I am beyond recriminations
The curtains are shut, the furniture is gone
I'm transforming, I'm vibrating, I am a-glowing
I am a-flying, well, I'm transforming, I'm vibrating, well, look at me now
I am glowing, I am flying, well, look at me now
I'm transforming, I'm vibrating, well, look at me now
Yeah, I'm transforming, I'm vibrating, I am glowing
I am flying, look at me nowEmbed
