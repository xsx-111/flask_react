Palaces of Montezuma (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
Psychedelic invocations
Mata Hari at the station
I give to you
A Javan princess of Hindu birth
A woman of flesh, a child of the earth
I give to you
The hanging gardens of Babylon
Miles Davis, the black unicorn
I give to you
The palaces of Montezuma
The gardens of Akbar's tomb
I give to you
The Spider Goddess, the Needle Boy
The slave-dwarves that they employ
I give to you
A custard-coloured super-dream
Of Ali MacGraw and Steve McQueen
I give to you

C'mon baby, get me out of the cold
And gimme, gimme, gimmе your precious love for me to hold
C'mon baby, gеt me out of the cold
And gimme, gimme, gimme your precious love for me to hold
The epic of Gilgamesh
A pretty little black A-line dress
I'll buy it for you
The spinal cord of JFK
Wrapped in Marilyn Monroe's negligee
I give to you
I want nothing in return
Just the softest little breathless word
I ask of you
A word contained in a grain of sand
That can barely walk, can't even stand
I ask of you

C'mon baby, get me out of the cold
And gimme, gimme, gimme your precious love for me to hold
C'mon baby, get me out of the cold
And gimme, gimme, gimme your precious love for me to holdEmbed
