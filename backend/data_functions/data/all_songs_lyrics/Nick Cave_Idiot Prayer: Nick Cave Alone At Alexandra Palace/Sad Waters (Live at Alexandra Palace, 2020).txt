Sad Waters (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
We go down to the river where the willows weep
Take a naked root for a lovers seat
That rose out of the bitten soil
Bound to the ground by creeping ivy coils
Oh, Mary you have seduced my soul
Forever a hostage of your child's world

Then I ran my tin-cup heart along
The prison of her ribs
With a toss of her curls
That little girl goes wading in
Rollin' her dress up past her knees
Turning these waters into wine
She plaited all the willow vines

Mary in the shallows laughing
Over where the carp dart
Spooked by the new shadows that she's cast
Across these sad waters and across my heartEmbed
