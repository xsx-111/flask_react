Black Hair (Live at Alexandra Palace, 2020) Lyrics
Last night my kisses were banked in black hair
And in my bed, my lover, her hair was midnight black
And all her mystery dwelled within her black hair
Her black hair framed a happy heart shaped face
To kiss her milk white throat, dark curtain of black hair
Smothered me, my lover with her beautiful black hair
The smell of it is heavy, it is charged with life
On my fingers lingers the smell of her deep black hair
Full of all my whispered words, her black hair
And wet with tears and goodbyes, her hair of deepest black
And all my tears cried against her milk white throat
Hidden behind the curtain of her beautiful, beautiful black hair
Deep as ink, black, black as the deepest sea
The smell of her black hair upon my pillow
Where her head and all its black hair did rest

Today she took a train to the West
Today she took a train to the West
Today she took a train to the West
To the WestEmbed
