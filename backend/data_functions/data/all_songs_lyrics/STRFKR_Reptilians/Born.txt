Born Lyrics
So many people, feelings, troubles
So many problems, callings, when I

Just wanna hold your little hand
Just want a dog out in the sand
Just wanna dig a hole for everyone
Where nothing's wrong, nothing's clever
All our sorrows wash out in the waves

So many people, evil, killing
So many creatures, eons, and sighs

Just wanna take you by the hand
And build a castle in the sand
We'll make a giant moat for everyone
Where nothing's wrong, nothing's clever
All our sorrows wash out in the waves7Embed
