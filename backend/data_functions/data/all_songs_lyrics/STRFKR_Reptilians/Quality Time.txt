Quality Time Lyrics
We see, don’t we, all that we experience is understandable as a spectrum of vibrations
There are different kinds of spectrums: there is a spectrum of light, there’s a spectrum of sound
We can also think of spectrum of smells, of tactile feelings, of emotions
And so on all down the line, we are as if we’re living in the midst of a woven tapestry of many dimensions
In which the warps and the loops are all these different spectra; various kinds of vibrations
