Hungry Ghost Lyrics
"If you are aware of a state which you call 'is,'
Or reality, or life, this implies another state called 'isn't.'
Or illusion, or unreality, or nothingness, or death
There it is, you can't know one without the other
And so, as to make life poignant
It's always got to come to an end
That is exactly, don't you see, what makes it lively
Liveliness is change, is motion
And motion is going 'nnnnnnneeeeeaaw!,' like this
See, they fall out
You can see you are always at the place where you always are
Only, it keeps appearing to change."1Embed
