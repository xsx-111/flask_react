Julius LyricsNow I wait alone
For deathï»¿ to come
Faded pictures
So I know
Nowhere to go
So I don't
Picture your body
Hearing your voice
And fall into your eyes
Your eyes
Through crooked lines
The morning light
Faded pictures
In my mind
Not scared of death
Now I know
Picture your body
Hearing your voice
And fall into your eyes
Your eyes
Fall into your eyes4Embed
