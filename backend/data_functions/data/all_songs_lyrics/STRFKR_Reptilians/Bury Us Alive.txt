Bury Us Alive Lyrics
I know
Nothing ever keeps you safe for sure
No one ever dug down so far, we'd go
When heroes dropped their bombs outside
No one ever knew I made it
No one ever

Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive

Below, nothing ever grows
I'd come to see I'd froze
No one even noticed 'til I climbed and saw
The new world clouded out the sun
No one ever learned
(I see a touch of death to set me free)

Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive3Embed
