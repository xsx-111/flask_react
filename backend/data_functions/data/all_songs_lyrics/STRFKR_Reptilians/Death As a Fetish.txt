Death As a Fetish LyricsNo shame, shame like a family
White trash hang from the Christmas tree
Ghost dad keeping the secrets
And float the dead ones home
And I will never be good enough, quietly
And you will never be good enough, just like me
And I will never be good enough, quietly
And you will never be good enough, never be good
So "Cure" look like a magazine
Big heart, I wanna let it bleed
Oceans keeping the secrets
And float the bodies home
And I will never be good enough, quietly
And you will never be good enough, just like me
And I will never be good enough, quietly
And I will never be good enough
I will never be good enough
I will never be good enough
I will never be good enough
You're born (Death as a fetish)
Your sins (Death as a fetish)
Your smile (Death as a fetish)
Your friends (Death as a fetish)
Your music (Death as a fetish)
Your first kiss (Death as a fetish)
Your grandkids (Death as a fetish)
Your secret (Death as a fetish)
Your tiny feet (Death as a fetish)
Your family (Death as a fetish)
Your pretty eyes (Death as a fetish)
Your perfect teeth (Death as a fetish)
Your money (Death as a fetish)
Your someday (Death as a fetish)
Your parents (Death as a fetish)
You're perfect (Death as a fetish)
(Death as a fetish)
(Death as a fetish)
(Death as a fetish)3Embed
