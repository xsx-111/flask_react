Mona Vegas LyricsI am a lonely girl
Sugar for neon lights
Never forget the sun
Only a dream tonight
Let me take care
Care for you
Care for you
I am the only girl
Sure fire and neon light
We are the only ones
High as a desert night
Lover forget the sun
I'll be your dream tonight
Let me take care
Care for you...Embed
