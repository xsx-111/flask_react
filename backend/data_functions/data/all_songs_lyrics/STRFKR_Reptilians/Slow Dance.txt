Slow Dance LyricsFollow me, There we'll go
To the darkness, crossed and shout
There's something, I can't see
There's a voice, It's calling me
Come along, Timing wrong
To the sea's in-a broken boat
All my thoughts, Underneath
In my heart, where we belong
Only the tide is high
Only my lane behind
Don't look far, come back home
I can't breathe through a broken soul
From the sea, I should go
Hard to see, where we should go
Follow me, There's a hope
Only thoughts, and part unknown
From the start, of the song
In my heart, where we belong2Embed
