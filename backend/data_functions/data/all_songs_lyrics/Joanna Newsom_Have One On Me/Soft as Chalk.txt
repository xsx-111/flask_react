Soft as Chalk LyricsSo, so long ago
And so far away
When Time was just a line
That you fed me
When you wanted to stay
We'd talk
As soft as chalk
Till morning came, pale as a pearl:
No time!
No time!
Now, I have got all the time
In the world
Say, honey, did you belong to me?
Tell me, honey
Was your heart at rest when, darlin
All the mourning doves were howling us
A song of love's
Godawful lawlessness? Lawlessness
Say, honey, did you belong to me?
Tell me, honey, did I pass your test?
I lay, as still as death, until the dawn
Whereupon I wrested from
Your godawful lawlessness. Lawlessness
I roam around the tidy grounds
Of my dappled sanatorium
Coatless, I sit
Amongst the motes, adrift
And I dote upon my pinesap gum
And the light, through the pines
In brassy tines
Lays over me, dim as rum
And thick as molasses
And so time passes
And so, my heart, tomorrow comes
I feel you, leaning
Out back with the crickets
Loyal heart marking the soon-ness
Darkness:
Tonight, still
The mourning doves
Will summon us their song
Of love's neverdoneing lawlessness, lawlessness
While, over and over —
Rear up! Stand down! Lay round! —
Trying to sound-out
Or guess the reasons
I sleep like a soldier, without rest
But there is no treason
Where there is only lawlessness. Lawlessness
In the last week
Of the last year I was aware
I took a blind shot, across the creek
At the black bear
When he roused me in the night
And left me cowering with my light
Calling out
Who is there?
Who's there?
Who is there?
I watched you sleep
Repeating my prayer
(You give love a little shove
And it becomes terror.)
And now I am calling
In a sadness beyond anger
And beyond fear
Who is there? Who's there?
Who is there?
I glare and nod
Like the character, God
Bearing down
Upon the houses and lawns
I knew a little bit
But, darling, you were it
And, darling, now it is long gone
Sweetheart, in your clean, bright start —
Back, there behind a hill, and a dell
And a state line or two —
I'll be thinking of you
Yes, I'll be thinking
And be wishing you well
We land, I stand
But I wait for the sound of the bell
I have to catch a cab
And my bags are at the carousel
And then — Lord, just then —
Time alone will only tell
You mourning dove1Embed
