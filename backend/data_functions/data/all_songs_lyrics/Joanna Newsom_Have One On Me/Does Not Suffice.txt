Does Not Suffice LyricsI will pack all my pretty dresses
I will box up my high-heeled shoes
A sparkling ring, for every finger
I'll put away, and hide from view
Coats of bouclé, jacquard and cashmere;
Cartouche and tweed, all silver-shot —
And everything that could remind you
Of how easy I was not
I'll tuck away my gilded buttons;
I'll bind my silks in shapeless bales;
Wrap it all on up in reams of tissue
And then I'll kiss you, sweet, farewell
You saw me rise to our occasion
And so deny the evidence
Caused me to burn, and twist
And grimace against you
Like something caught
On a barbed wire fence
Now, you can see me fall back here
Redoubled
Full bewildered and amazed
I have gotten into some terrible trouble
Beneath your blank and rinsing gaze
It does not suffice
For you to say I am a sweet girl
Or to say you hate to see me sad
Because of you
It does not suffice
To merely lie beside each other
As those who love each other do
I picture you, rising up in the morning:
Stretching out on your boundless bed
Beating a clear path to the shower
Scouring yourself red
The tap of hangers
Swaying in the closet —
Unburdened hooks
And empty drawers —
And everywhere I tried to love you
Is yours again
And only yours
La-la-la-la...2Embed
