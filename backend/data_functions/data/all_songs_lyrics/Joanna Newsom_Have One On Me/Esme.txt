Esme LyricsI can feel a difference
Today, a difference:
All of us, in our tents
Fearing god like a mistress
We lay on the rocks, in the sun
Watching you and your mama row in
I sat up and blinked
When you appeared
So pale you were nearly clear!
Later, I stumbled to my bed
All alone in the branches
I laid in the dark
Thinking about all of my friends
And their changes
And I do not know
If you know just what you have done
You are the sweetest one
I have ever laid my eyes upon
It's a beautiful town
With the rain coming down
Blackberry, rosemary
Jimmy-crack-corn
You've got the run of the place
Now that you're running around;
And may kindness
Kindness, kindness abound
In this hour of our lives —
Hour of effortless plenty —
How do we know
Which parts of our hearts want what
With such base generosity?
Taking so many photographs —
So amazed! —
We've never seen a baby so newlyborn
And, when the bulbs do flash
As bright as morning
The crowd keeps on gathering
Like an electric storm
The phantom of love
Moves among us at will
Each phantom-limb lost
Has got an angel
(So confused
Like the wagging bobbed-tail
Of a bulldog):
Kindness, kindness prevails
Kindness prevails!
Ties and rails, ties and rails fall into line
Bearing kindness
Where will you go, if not here?
What will you say
When you write to us?
And this is a world of terrible hardship
Everywhere
And I search for words
To set you at ease
But there, in the looking-glass
A kite is soaring
Stilling my warring heart
And my trembling knees
Clean as a breeze
Bright as the day:
All of the people gather to say:
"Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme!"
Oh, oh, oh!
I believe love will always surround you —
Brave as a bear
With a heart rare and true
But if you are scared
If you are blue
I have prepared this small song for you:
Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme!
Oh, oh, oh!
Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme!
Oh, oh, oh!
Sweet Esme! Esme!
Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme!
Oh, oh, oh!1Embed
