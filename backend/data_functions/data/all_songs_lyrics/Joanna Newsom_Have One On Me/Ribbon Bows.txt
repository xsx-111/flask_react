Ribbon Bows LyricsThere is a spring, not far from here
The water runs both sweet and clear —
Both sweet and clear, and cold:
Could crack your bones
With veins of gold
I stood, a-wagging, at the tap;
Just a-waiting on the lagging, rising sap
I held the cold tin ladle to my lip
At the Shrine of the Thousand Arms
I lowered my eyes to sip
What a beautiful day to catch my drift
Or be caught up in it
You want your love, Love?
Come and get your love;
I only took it back
Because I thought you didn't
How my ears did ring
At the municipal pound
From that old hangdog
To which I was bound:
Curled 'round the bottom rung —
Doesn't nobody want you?
Well, come on, darlin
I could use someone like you around
I am not like you, I ain't from this place
And I do reserve the right
To repeat all my same mistakes
And, in the night, like you
I certainly bite and chew
What I can find
And never seem to lose the taste
What a horrible face I feel me make —
For Pete's sake
What you have told me, I cannot erase! —
(Though I keep on saying
And I do believe, it is not too late)
All day, you're hassling me with trifles:
Black nose of the dog, as cold as a rifle
Indicating, with a nudge
God, No God. God, No God
Sweet, appraising eye of the dog
Blink once if god
Twice if no god
My mama may be ashamed of me
With all of my finery:
Carrying on
Whooping it up till the early morn
Lost and lorn
Among the madding revelry!
Sure, I can pass
Honey, I can pass
Particularly when I start to tip my glass
I'll be a sport
And have a go at that old song
Singing unabashed, about
'Them city girls
With their ribbon bows
And their fancy sash...'
But, though I get so sad
(Could swear the night
Makes a motion to claim me
Around that second verse)
I reckon I've felt worse
And still held fast
But, later on, when I am alone
Alone at last
Well I take my god to task
I take my daggone god to task2Embed
