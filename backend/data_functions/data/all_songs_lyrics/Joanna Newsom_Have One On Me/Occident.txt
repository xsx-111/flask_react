Occident LyricsMercy me, the night is long
Take my pen, to write you this song
Lord: is it harder to carry on
Or to know when you are done?
All my life, I felt as though
I'm inside a beautiful memory
Replaying
With the sound turned down low
Long-life, show your face
Slow-heart, curb your taste
Smoke me out of my hiding place
Long-life, state your case
What in the world are we waiting for —
Building glowing cities along the shore
Where the wind batters in
Baiting my kin like a matador?
So much value, placed upon
What lies just beyond our plans:
Waving my handkerchief
Running along, till the end of the sand
Long-life, speak your name
So tired of the guessing game
But, something is moving
Just out of frame:
Slow-heart
Brace and aim
Breaching slowly, across the sea
One mast —
Flash, like the stinger of a bee —
To take you away
A swarming fleet is gonna take you
From me
The universe is getting loose:
Sodden spread
From some leaden disuse
Rushing, unhinged
Towards diminishing lights
Like a headless caboose
I'll wait for you
Alongside the ocean
And make do
With my no-skin
But then, Long-life
Will you let me in?
And then, Slow-heart
Are you gonna know him?
Long-life, speak your name
I wait, while I decry the wait
And when I die, may I relate:
Slow heart, congregate
To leave your home, and your family
For some distortion of property?
Well, darling, I can't go
But you may stay
Here, with me1Embed
