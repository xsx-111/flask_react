On a Good Day LyricsHey hey hey, the end is near!
On a good day
You can see the end from here
But I won't turn back, now
Though the way is clear;
I will stay for the remainder
I saw a life, and I called it mine
I saw it, drawn so sweet and fine
And I had begun to fill in all the lines
Right down to what we'd name her
Our nature does not change by will
In the winter, 'round the ruined mill
The creek is lying, flat and still;
It is water
Though it's frozen
So, 'cross the years
And miles, and through
On a good day
You can feel my love for you
Will you leave me be
So that we can stay true
To the path that you have chosen?2Embed
