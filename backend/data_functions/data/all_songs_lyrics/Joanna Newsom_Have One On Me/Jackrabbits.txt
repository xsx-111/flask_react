Jackrabbits Lyrics
I was tired of being drunk
My face cracked like a joke
So I swung through here
Like a brace of jackrabbits
With their necks all broke

I stumbled at the door with my boot
And I knocked against the jamb
And I scrabbled at your chest, like a mute
With my fists of ham

Trying to tell you that I am
Telling you I can —
I can
Love you again
Love you again

I'm squinting towards the East
My faith makes me a dope
But you can take my hand
In the darkness, darling
Like a length of rope
I shaped up overnight, you know
The day after she died
When I saw my heart
And I'll tell you, darling
It was open wide

What with telling you I am
Telling you I can —
I can
Love you again
Love you again

And it can have no bounds, you know
It can have no end
You can take my hand
In the darkness, darling
When you need a friend

And it can change in shape or form
But never change in size
Well the water, it ran deep, my darling
Where it don't run wide
The feather of a hawk was bound
Bound around my neck;
A poultice made of fig
The eager little vultures pecked

And a verse I read in jest
In Matthew, spoke to me;
Said There's a flame that moves
Like a low-down pest
That says, You will be free

Only, tell me that I can
Tell me that I can:
I can love you again;
Love you again
Love you again, love you again
Love you again, love you again
Love you again, love you again
Love you again, love you again
Love you again, love you...Embed
