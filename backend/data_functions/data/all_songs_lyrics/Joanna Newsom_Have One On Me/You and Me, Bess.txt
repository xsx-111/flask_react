You and Me, Bess LyricsWe picked our way
Down to the beach
Watching the waves
Dragging out of our reach:
Tangling tails, like a sodden sheet;
Dangling entrails
From the gut of the sea
Hoarding our meals (alfalfa and rolls);
Trying not to catch
The cold eye of the gulls —
I hope Mother Nature has not
Overheard!
(Though, she doles out hurt
Like a puking bird)
We stayed for the winter
No-one told us
About the laws of the land
I hold my own
But you, with your hunger —
You, on the other hand —
Make yourself known
And when we were found
I know we both grieved
My heart made the sound
Of snow falling from eaves
You and me, Bess
We was as thick as thieves
So I swore, nonetheless, up and down
It was only me
So they took me away
And, after some time
Studying my case
Must have made up their minds
By the time you realized I was dying
Must have been too late
I believe you were not lying
It is the day
I wake
With my ears cocked up like a gun
(Like every day, of course)
Yanked by my wrists
To the sugar-front court yard —
Now tell me, what have I done?
Seems I have stolen a horse
And I step to the gallows
Who do you think that you are —
Arching your hooves like a crane
In the shallow gutter
That lines the boulevards
Crowded with folks
Who just stare as I hang?
It's all the same
Kindness comes over me;
What was your name?
It makes no difference
I'm glad that you came
Forever, I'll listen to your glad neighingEmbed
