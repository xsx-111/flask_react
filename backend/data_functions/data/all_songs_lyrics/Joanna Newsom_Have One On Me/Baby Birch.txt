Baby Birch LyricsThis is the song for Baby Birch
I will never know you
And at the back of what we've done
There is the knowledge of you
Well I wish we could take every path
Could spend a hundred years
Adoring you
Yes, I wish we could take every path
'Cause you know I hated to close
The door on you
Do you remember staring
Up at the stars
So far away in their bulletproof cars?
When we heard the rushing, slow intake
Of the dark, dark water
And the engine breaks
And I said
How about them engine breaks?
And, if I should die before I wake
Will you keep an eye on Baby Birch?
Because I'd hate to see her
Make the same mistake
When it was dark
I called and you came
When it was dark, I saw shapes
When I see stars, I feel, in your hand
And I see stars
And I reel, again
Well mercy me. I'll be goddamned
It's been a long, long time
Since I last saw you
And I have never known the plan
It's been a long, long time
How are you?
Your eyes are green. Your hair is gold
Your hair is black. Your eyes are blue
I closed the ranks, and I doubled back â€”
But, you know I hated to close
The doggone door on you
We take a walk along the dirty lake
Hear the goose
Cussing at me over her eggs
You poor little cousin
I don't want your dregs
(A little baby fussing over my legs)
There is a blacksmith
And there is a shepherd
And there is a butcher-boy
And there is a barber, who's cutting
And cutting away at my only joy
I saw a rabbit
As slick as a knife
And as pale as a candlestick
And I had thought it'd be harder to do
But I caught her, and skinned her quick:
Held her there
Kicking and mewling
Upended, unspooling, unsung and blue;
Told her "Wherever you go
Little runaway bunny
I will find you."
And then she ran
As they're liable to do
Be at peace baby, and be gone
Be at peace baby, and be gone5Embed
