Hold Ya Mouf Lyrics
Get me
We got a lot to talk 'bout
Raskit, God's Gift
Oi yo
What you do will come back to you
(What you do will come back to you)
What you do will come back to you
(What you do will come back to you)
What you do will come back to you
(What you do will come back)
Hold your mouth (Hold your mouth)

Raskit don't give a shit (I mean, yo)
Ain't concerned, ain't worried, don't mind
But you should watch your lip (I mean)
If you keep chatting in a hurry, you'll find
The bottom of a 6 foot pit (I mean)
Don't care what creed, colour or kind
Bullets'll make you sit (I mean)
Make you relax, lay down, unwind
Raskit don't give a damn (I mean)
Ain't that bothered not much, don't care
Catch me if you can (I mean)
It's possible you will get hit with a chair
Talk like you're the man (I mean)
If you want beef, you'll get a fair share
Dizzee got a master plan (I mean)
I'm a problem for Anthony Blair
Raskit don't have a bar (I mean)
Don't have it from him, her or dem
I'll make a rudeboy say 'rah' (I mean)
With or without the use of a skeng
Remove you from your car (I mean)
Got a temper, it's big like Ben
And I don't care who you are (I mean)
Move to your boys, I'll move to your men
Raskit don't waste time (I mean)
Don't hesitate, don't pet, don't ramp
.22, .38, .9 (I mean)
These digits'll leave you stiff like cramp
You wanna test? That's fine (I mean)
You couldn't take Dizzee Rascal for a tramp
If you cross my line (I mean)
I'll leave you colourful, dazed and damp
I don't want beef today (Nah)
It's not arms today
Let's keep it calm today
Let's be friends
I don't wanna write today
Let's not fight today
I feel alright today
Let's be friends
You got a problem, blud
Let's solve it, blud
Gats and borers, blud
Hold your mouth
You got a problem, blud
Let's solve it, blud
Gats and borers, blud
Hold your mouth

Yo, it don't make no sense to me
Why fellas don't wanna act sensibly
You better re-check your identity
You better re-check how you speak (Uh)
You don't make no sense to me
If I switch I won't act sensibly
I'll make you care intensively
You'll be in a coma for a week
And I really can't come to grips
With how these fellas act just like chicks
But now I retaliate with clips
And now I retaliate with force
You should come to grips
With how you really should watch your lips
You better know we're some lunatics
And that we retaliate, of course
You don't wanna feel the heat from my-
I roll deep with my-, I'm always on the street with my-
I eat with my-, I sleep with my-
And I can put you 6 foot deep with my-
Chat shit you get beat with my-
Roll straight sound be the street with my-
Drive, I'm never on my feet with my-
I'm only on my feet when I bust heat
And you just ran outta luck with my-
Say you're gonna get fucked up with my-
Gunshots leave bodies bruk with my-
And I can make the whole place duck with my-
If you don't wanna get stuck with my-
Run when I get out the truck with my-
Cause you'll get jacked and gun-butt with my-
And I'll leave your whole jaw bruk with my-1Embed
