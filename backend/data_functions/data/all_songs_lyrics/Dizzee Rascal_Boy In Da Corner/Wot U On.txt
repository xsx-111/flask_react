Wot U On Lyrics
Love talks to everyone
Love talks to everyone
Love talks to everyone, money talks more
Love talks to everyone, money talks more
Love talks to everyone, money talks more
I couldn't be a chief, money money money
Love talks to everyone, money talks more
I couldn't be a chief, I couldn't be a chief
Big shout to the boy who thinks he's a dappa
You're looking at your jewellery thinking you're a dappa
Now you're round your way trying say you're a dappa
I'll stop you in your midst with a blicks, gun clapper
Big shout to the boy who thinks he's a don
You're looking at your Avirex thinking you're a don
Now you're in your ends with your friends, you're a don
I'll catch you by yourself, make your health all gone
Big shout to the boy who thinks he's a scones
You're looking at your half ounce thinking you're a scones
You're always walking round trying sound like a scones
But make no mistake, you're a fake, Dizzee knows
Big shout to the boy who thinks he's a G
You're looking at your fake watch thinking you're a G
I see you Stratford Rex tryna flex like a G
Looking for your yat she was sat next to me
Okay
You could be a dappa (What?)
You could be a don (Uh)
But I ain't watching face
I don't care where you're from
Look, show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong? (Uh)
Show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong? (Come again)
You could be a Scones (Scones)
You could be a G (G)
But dat's anything (Anything)
That's minor to me (Yo)
Show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong? (Yo)
Yes, show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong?
Big shout to the girl who thinks she's a diva
You're at your dressing table thinking you're a diva
But steady tryna walk, tryna talk like a diva
Now you just wonder an underachiever
Big shout to the girl who thinks she's a devil
You're looking for a way to cause harm like a devil
You're sitting in your yard talking hard like a devil
Cold, bitter, gold digger looking for a medal
Big shout to the girl who thinks she's a swingers
You're running up your gums to da boys like a swingers
You're chatting to a breh, you don't care, you're a swingers
But now you're on the floor reading war for beginners
Big shout to the girl who thinks it's a game
You're always chatting air, gossiping like a game
You chat business of mine, all the time, like a game
Don't make me have to skitz, keep your lips from my name
Okay
You could be a dappa (What?)
You could be a don (Uh)
But I ain't watching face
I don't care where you're from
Look, show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong? (Uh)
Show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong? (Come again)
You could be a Scones (Scones)
You could be a G (G)
But dat's anything (Anything)
That's minor to me (Yo)
Show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong? (Yo)
Yes, show me what you're on
Where you at man?
Where's your cash, where's your wong?
I heard you got a problem with me? (Rude boy, listen)
Why you tryna beg enemies? (Rude boy, listen)
Go and get your street family (Rude boy, listen)
I'll be waiting patiently (Rude boy, listen)
God, stop chatting my name (Rude girl, check it)
Any little way of getting fame (Rude girl, check it)
Me and your man ain't the same (Rude girl, check it)
You ain't got no shame (Rude girl, check it)
I love girls and (Money, money, money)
I don't watch face, I watch (Money, money, money)
I worked real hard for the (Money, money, money)
Am in the paper chase for the (Money, money, money)
I'm from the streets so (I couldn't be a chief)
Got girls on my case so (I couldn't be a chief)
If it's arms, we can meet 'cause (I couldn't be a chief)
I'll put you in your place 'cause (I couldn't be a chief)
Okay
Okay
You could be a dappa (What?)
You could be a don (Uh)
But I ain't watching face
I don't care where you're from
Look, show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong? (Uh)
Show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wong? (Come again)
You could be a Scones (Scones)
You could be a G (G)

Show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wand? (Yo)
Yes, show me what you're on
Where's your cash, where's your wand?

You could be a dappa, I couldn't be a chief
You could be a dappa, I couldn't be a chief
You could be a dappa, I couldn't be a chief
You could be a dappa, I couldn't be a chief1Embed
