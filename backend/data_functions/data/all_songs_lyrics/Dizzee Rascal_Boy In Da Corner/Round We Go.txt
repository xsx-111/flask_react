Round We Go Lyrics
Uh,  love you 
It's not a love ting right now cuz
You either love me or I just love you too, too
Bro it just ain't
I will love you, love you, love me like you love 
Get me? Yo

Ain't no love ting here (No love ting)
It's just one big cycle here (Cycle, cycle)
Yo, ain't no friendship here (No friendships)
It's just one big cycle here (Cycle, cycle)
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round)
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round, 'round, 'round we go)
If you love me, let me know
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round, 'round, 'round we go)
If you love me, let me know (Dizzee Rascal, yah)

She used to love him, he used to love her
She used to kiss him, he used to hug her
Call it deep love or puppy love, they bunked off school
Now there's no flame, things ain't the same
Looks like she changed, thinks it's some game
He's left in the rain trying to point blame, took for a fool
She moved on quick, he still lovesick
She's not having it, thinks he's some prick
He don’t believe it, wants it just the how it was in school
He keeps callin' night or mornin'
Break of evenin', break of dawnin'
He keeps ringing up, she keeps hanging up, oh, what a fool
She is the best friend of the ex-girlfriend of her old school friend
Who is the close friend of this best friend
Best friend likes this boy called Blue
Best friend loves him, best friend needs him
But the ex-girlfriend of the old school friend
Who is the close friend of his best friend likes him too
So the ex-girlfriend of the old school friend
Who is the close friend of his best friend
Sits with best friend who by now has slept with Blue
Now the ex-girlfriend don’t want to pretend
That she ain't slept with that boy Blue
'Cause he was a friend of her ex-man too
Listen
Ain't no love ting here (No love ting)
It's just one big cycle here (Cycle, cycle)
Yo, ain't no friendship here (No friendships)
It's just one big cycle here (Cycle, cycle)
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round)
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round, 'round, 'round we go)
If you love me, let me know
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round, 'round, 'round we go)
If you love me, let me know (Yah)

I'll wreck any girl
Check any girl, I expect any girl
Rarely reject any girl
Sex any girl, I'll just select any girl
Black girl, white girl, mixed race girl
Big bum, big tits, pretty face girl
Mauritius, Asian, Chinese girl
Keep it DL, I kiss but don't tell, yo
We do big pimpin'
Late night daylight, big pimpin'
Why you laughing, that's your girl I'm linkin'
That's a quick juicin', it's no love ting
Just bend her over and I leave her limpin'
No lipsin', that's not interestin'
No cuddlin' 'cause I'm not carin'
And no talkin' just straight to the ting 'cause
Ain't no love ting here (No love ting)
It's just one big cycle here (Cycle, cycle)
Yo, ain't no friendship here (No friendships)
It's just one big cycle here (Cycle, cycle)
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round)
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round, 'round, 'round we go)
If you love me, let me know
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round, 'round, 'round we go)
If you love me, let me know

What's all this love ting talk?
Holding hands everywhere that you walk?
She turned you bocat and now you lick toes
And she's not faithful, everybody knows
She keeps saying that she loves you
What made you think that was true?
Just let a baiders walk through
I guarantee that'll be the end of you, look
True say that girl's the boom ting, man
But she's trouble, she'll make your head spin, man
Slow down back off the love ting, man
You don't wanna be left hurtin', man
Cut the sweet talk, it ain't workin', man
And move on, she's already blurted, man
You ain't the first, you won't be her last man
You feel worse, 'cause you know you're too fast man
Ain't no love ting here (No love ting)
It's just one big cycle here (Cycle, cycle)
Yo, ain't no friendship here (No friendships)
It's just one big cycle here (Cycle, cycle)
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round)
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round, 'round, 'round we go)
If you love me, let me know
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go
'Round, 'round, 'round we go ('Round, 'round, 'round we go)
If you love me, let me knowEmbed
