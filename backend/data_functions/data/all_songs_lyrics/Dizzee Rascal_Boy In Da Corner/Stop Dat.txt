Stop Dat Lyrics
Stop dat, start dat, get dat (What?)
Been there, done that, had that (What?)
He's got a Nokia, take that (What?)
Big mouth, loud mouth, watch that (What?)
Pretty girl, buff girl, doggy that (What?)
Dizzee Rascal's on the format (What?)
Badminders get a backslap (What?)
I call the shots like Topcat (What?)
Jack and stack up, done that (What?)
I'm a rudeboy, done proved that (What?)
Boy in da corner, I'm that (What?)
New school lyrical Glock, that (What?)
Best friend, soul mate, what's that? (What?)
Girlfriend, wifey, bang that (What?)
Cheap condo, reload that (What?)
Dedication, we show that
Chucking MCs like stones
Bad boy forever like Sean Puffy Combs
Inside, outside, running all zones
Set trends, get girls like Tom Jones
Break bones when your housewife leaves home
Yet his wifey don't leave me alone
That boy's arrogant, send for the chrome
Come barefoot like Fred Flinstone
You got a big gun? Come, bring it out
Butterfly knife? Come along, fling it out
We could just do it old school, swing it out
I suggest you best start winging out
Who's that? What's that? Boydem about?
Yeah, man, quick, man, start spreading out
Kidnap, take 'em Rascal's hideout
Cold sweat, tired out, get burnt out
Alright
Boys, girls start moving
Come on, girls, boys, start moving, alright
Don't stop, don't stop, til it's hurting
Come on, don't stop don't stop, til you're bleeding, alright
Boys, girls start shubsing
Come on, girls, boys, start shubsing, alright
Don't stop, don't stop, til it's hurting
Come on, don't stop don't stop, til you're bleeding, alright
Boys, girls start moving
Come on, girls, boys start moving, alright
Don't stop, don't stop, til it's hurting
Come on, don't stop don't stop, til you're bleeding, alright
Boys, girls start shubsing
Come on, girls, boys, start shubsing, alright
Don't stop, don't stop, til it's hurting
Come on, don't stop don't stop, til you're bleeding, alright

Got a screwface all night, all day
Screwface keeps breddas at bay
Screwface means keep well away, stay away
Screwface means get out my way
Screwface means you don't know me
What you looking at? What's your beef?
Screwface means I'm not having it
Screwface means I'm not a chief
Screwface means I'm not happy right now
That's why no smile was used
Screwface means I'm not pleased
Screwface means I'm not amused
Screwface means I just wanna walk, not talk
Screwface means I just wanna leave
When I activate my screwface, give me space
Screwface means let me breathe
I got sick flows, make an MC have to walk on his tip-toes
Life ain't always nice, that's how shit goes
And you know we're going on black 'cause we're blick rows
And I can't be seen with these sick hoes
Where did I stay last night? I think your chick knows
We were knock-knocking the boots and we kicked toes
Your girl's the same as all bimbos, freaks and nymphos
I've got an idea, make dough on the spot, I mean right here
Nike Air, got paper for the whole year
You can bring drama 'cause I got no fear
And my head feels so clear
Move to the mic, MCs are like "oh dear"
Some try catching me up but they're not near
Not ever, not now and not here, way too hot here
(
Oi, rudeboy
Oi, , next riddim, next riddim, next riddim, next riddim, next riddim)
Look, look, girls, ladies, do the butterfly
Shake your batty low, shake your batty high
Don't ask me who, where, when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky
Girls, ladies, do the butterfly
Shake your batty low, shake your batty high
Don't ask me who, where, when or why
Wanna see your batty rise high to the sky3Embed
