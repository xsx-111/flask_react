2 Far Lyrics
Yo, I don't promote no violence but
If that boy gets arrogant, I'll
Leave that boy in the basement, so
Done with the bad boy talk, just walk
I'm not a female beater, but
If that girl gets feisty, I'll
Slap that girl all hasty 'cause
She might be buff, but she's not rough
I can't believe I'm hearing that
Boy thinks I'm not near him, just
Let me draw his girlfriend, I'll
Cut no slack, she'll never go back
Marriage, love, wife; please!
All that talk is stupid, plus
I don't believe in cupid 'cause
Sometimes most times everyone two-times

Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, yo, yo
I don't obey no policemen 'cause (Never)
They forget they're human, uh
Get excited quickly but
He ain't got a gun, I'll kick him and run
Don't tell me about royalty 'cause (What?)
Queen Elizabeth don't know me, so
How can she control me when
I live street and she lives neat (Come on)
I love raves and concerts, but
There's just too much violence and
I can't stand no nonsense, uhhh
Book me, watch me, hear me, pay me
I've been far too friendly now
Everybody wants a favour, but
I'm not no ones saviour 'cause
Where was you when I was blue?!

Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, yo
Yo, talk in the mic, I'll talk neat (Neat)
Talk to your wife, I'll talk sweet (Sweet)
Talkin' tough, I'll talk with my feet (Feet)
Rascal's raw like red meat (Meat)
Talk aggy, talk rough (Rough)
Talk sexy, talk buff (Buff)
Certain girls talk 'nuff (Talk too much man)
Talk anything, anywhere, any stuff
Yeah we got style, we'll get gash
Yeah we got style, we'll make cash
Certain man talk trash ('Nuff)
Act funny, act flash (Yeah)
Bring your borer, bring your mash (Bring it)
Get banged, get bashed
I don't care who they are, where they are (No)
If they wanna bring the beef, we ain't far

Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No
I was hot stepping in my Nike Air sneaker
You didn't know I was an MC beater, defeater
Giving the MC a sleeper
I'm in to win fairly, I'm not a cheater
I'm starving, hungry ready to eat her
Your drinks sweet, but my drink's sweeter though
I'm getting stronger bro, you're getting weaker bro
I came straight from the gutter, lay low
I'm a ninja turtle, you can't step into my circle
In a sound clash I will hurt you
Paper, that's what I'm living for
They don't wanna make paper, they want a place on the floor and choong
That's what I want
I want choong things, a double bed fling with a choong ting
Wiley, Rascal that's the boom-ting
Galdem-a bang on my ends
No long ting!

Who do they think they are?
Push me too far
I don't care who you are
I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
Push me too far
I don't care who you are
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
No, I'm a super, superstar
Who do they think they are?
You push me too far
Look, I don't care who you are
