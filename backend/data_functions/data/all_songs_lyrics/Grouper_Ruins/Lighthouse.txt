Lighthouse LyricsI had a dream that someone came to find me again
Wonder if you're the old ship that landed here
The howling night will pass by
Oh we'll steal the verse
Calling on shadows
And calling on shadows
Be there
Oh let us stay, don't let our small dresses get rose
We move in circles of light
Carry your shape in the light of the cold
Let us return to the edge of the storm
Give us a way to bring all our bodies home
Let us return to the edge of the light
In circlesEmbed
