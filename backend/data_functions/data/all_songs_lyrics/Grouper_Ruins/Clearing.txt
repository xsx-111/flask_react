Clearing LyricsOpen up the window
Try to let the light out
Try to let the curtain float in
That way, I can hear the water
Pulling on a pathway
Calling on the pathway
Whispering and passing, shoes rattling
And I was thinking I was running
And every time I see you
I have to pretend I don't
You thought that it would help
But it's only made us fall apart
I'm treading in the water
Human in the shadows
No longer your shadow
Clearing, I know where your light is
More or less nothing changes
Maybe I’ve been seeing things
Cry to yourself with one
That are going out of home
And can't you see us fading
And soon there won't be anyone there
It's funny, when you fuck up
No one really has to care
Sometimes I wish
That none of this had happened
Let our sad song
Be carried out to sea
As steady as the water
As tender as the evening
Where we hurry
Down to build a shadow
As softly as an echo
As solid as a triangle
Send a message as you
Where everything is walking, there’s a hallway
And maybe you were right
When you said I'd never been in love
How can I explain
Why it's safer when I feel alone
And what has been done
May never be undone
So take your sad song
And sail into the next life
Maybe you were right
When you said I'd never been in love
How can I explain
Why it's safer just to be alone5Embed
