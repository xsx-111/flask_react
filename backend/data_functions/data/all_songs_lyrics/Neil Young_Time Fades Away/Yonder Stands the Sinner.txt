Yonder Stands the Sinner LyricsWell, you heard about the Great Pretender?
I went to see him and he's not the same
Down by the club on the parking lot cinders
I was to meet him and play his game
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound
I saw his face in the attic window
Yelling down through the broken pane
Sinner man!
What you got to run for?
Church bells rang when he said that name
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound
Well, I was about as scared as I could be
I went and hid behind the nearest tree
Peeked out
From behind the branches
Sinner!
Yonder stands the sinner
He calls my name without a sound
To get down
I guess you heard about the Great Pretender?
I went to see him and he's not the same
I guess you heard about the Great Pretender?
I went to see him and he's not the sameEmbed
