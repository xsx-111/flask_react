Time Fades Away Lyrics
Fourteen junkies
Too weak to work
One sells diamonds
For what they're worth
Down on pain street
Disappointment lurks

Son, don't be home too late
Try to get back by eight
Son, don't wait
Until the break of day
Because you know
How time fades away
Time fades away
You know how time fades away

All day presidents
Look out windows
All night sentries
Watch the moon glow
All are waiting until
The time is right

Back in Canada
I spent my days
Riding subways
Through a haze
I was handcuffed
I was born & raised


Thirteen junkies
Too weak to work
One sells diamonds
For what they're worth
Down on pain street
Disappointment lurks


Time fades away
You know how time fades awayEmbed
