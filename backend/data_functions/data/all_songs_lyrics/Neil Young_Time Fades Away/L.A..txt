L.A. Lyrics
In a matter of time
There'll be a friend of mine
Going to come to the coast
You're going to see him
Up close for a minute or two
While the ground cracks under you
By the look in your eyes
You'd think that it was a surprise
But you seem to forget
Something somebody said
About the bubbles in the sea
And an ocean full of trees

And you now, L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too? 

Well, it's hard to believe
So you get up to leave
And you laugh at the door
That you heard it all before
Oh it's so good to know
That it's all just a show for you
But when the suppers are planned
And the freeways are crammed
And the mountains erupt
And the valley is sucked
Into cracks in the earth
Will I finally be heard by you
L.A. uptight
City in the smog, city in the smog
Don't you wish that you could be here too? Embed
