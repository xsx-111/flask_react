Last Dance Lyrics
Wake up! It's a Monday morning
No time left to say goodbye
Can't breathe
And the lights are changing

You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughing
Oh no, oh no

Headlights
Make it home by sundown
Feeling that the day is through
Return back to where you come from


You wake up in the morning
And the sun's coming up
Its been up for hours
And hours and hours
And hours and hours and hours
It's been up for hours
And hours and hours
And you light up the stove
And the coffee cup, its hot
And the orange juice
Is cold, cold, cold
Monday morning
Wake up, wake up 
It's time to go
Time to go to work
You can live your own life
Making it happen
Working on your own time
Laid back and laughing
Oh no, oh no
No, no, noEmbed
