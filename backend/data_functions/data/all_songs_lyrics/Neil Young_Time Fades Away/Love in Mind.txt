Love in Mind Lyrics
Woke up this morning with love in mind
It was raining outside but my love still shined
Kept me warm Until my plane touched the sky

And I've seen love
Make a fool of a man
He tried to make a loser win
But I've got nothing to lose
I can't get back again
Man made rules
Been holdin' back my love
Can't hold it back no more
Churches long preach sex is wrong
Jesus where is nature gone?
What am I doing here?
