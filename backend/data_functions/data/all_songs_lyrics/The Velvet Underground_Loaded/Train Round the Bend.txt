Train Round the Bend Lyrics
Train round the bend
Taking me away from my country
I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city
Train going 'round the bend
Oh, train coming 'round the bend


Been in the country oh, much too long
Trying to be a farmer
But nothing that I planted ever seemed to grow
Train coming 'round the bend
Woah, train coming 'round the bend

Hey, I am just a city boy
I'm really not the country kind
Oh, I miss the city streets and the neon lights
You see the train coming 'round the bend, oh what
The train coming 'round the bend

Once, she's going twice
She's going two and up and down
She's going once, she's going twice
She's going the train coming 'round the bend
You know the train coming 'round the bend
Comin' down out of nowhere
Taking me back where I belong
I've been here once and I don't think it's too nice
Oh, the train's coming 'round the bend
Whoa, the train coming 'round the bend
AlrightEmbed
