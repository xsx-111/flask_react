I Found a Reason Lyrics
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa

I found a reason to keep living
Oh, and the reason, dear, is you
Oh, I found a reason to keep singing
Oh, and the reason, dear, is you

Oh, I do believe
If you don't like things you leave
For some place you've never gone before

Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa

Honey, I found a reason to keep living
And you know the reason, dear, it's you
And I've walked down life's lonely highways
Hand in hand with myself
And I realized
How many paths have crossed between us
Oh, I do believe
You are what you perceive
What comes is better than what came before


Oh, I do believe
You are what you perceive
What comes is better than what came before

Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
Pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa pa
And you'd better come, come, come, come to me
Come, come, come to me
Better come, come, come, come to me
Pa pa pa pa, pa1Embed
