Oxygen LyricsWe all ferment
A face can change
But souls stay young
We're all connected
So take a journey with someone
Learn to be as one
Still living, sinking, falling, twisting
But I'm breathing you in, breathing you in
Oxygen, Oxygen
We all ferment
A taste can change
From days so young
You feel rejected
Just hold your head up to the sun
Learn to be as one
Still living, sinking, falling, we're still living, drifting
I'm breathing you in, breathing you in
Still living, sinking, feeding, twisting, I'm living
I'm breathing you in, breathing you in
Disconnecting
Oxygen, Oxygen, Oxygen
Still living, sinking, falling, twisting
We're still living, I'm breathing you in, breathing you in
Still living, sinking, falling, drifting
We're living, I'm breathing you in, breathing you in
I'm breathing you in, breathing youEmbed
