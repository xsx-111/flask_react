Under The Weather LyricsI've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
A chainsaw cutting through my bed
I wish that I was still fifteen
Debbie Harry or Steve McQueen
I found the angel in my dream sucked her dry
And cut her wing
L.A. food store cabinet
Get up, shut up give me nurofen plus
Shut up, it hurts feel I been hit by a bus
Get up, shut up, you know you don't understand
I'm feeling under the weather
From the womb into school
Changing faces breaking rules
Circumstances make you bleed
Sew the wounds so you will heal
Cause there's no substitute for pain
Histrionics broken frames
Build a fire to thaw my brain
L.A. food store cabinet
Get up, shut up give me nurofen plus
Shut up, it hurts feel I been hit by a bus
Get up, shut up, you know you don't understand
I'm feeling under the weather
I don't know why I do this, time and time again
Cause all my drowning sorrows became my friends
I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
A chainsaw cutting through my bed
I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
L.A. food store cabinet
Get up, shut up
Give me nurofen plus
Shut up it hurts feel I've been hit by a bus
Get up shut up you know you don't understand
I'm feeling under the weather
I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
A chainsaw cutting through my bed
I've got a pain in my sick brain
Two red eyes and broken veins
I've got a hand inside my head
A chainsaw cutting through my bedEmbed
