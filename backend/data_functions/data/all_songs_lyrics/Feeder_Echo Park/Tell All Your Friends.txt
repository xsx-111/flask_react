Tell All Your Friends LyricsStaring out to reach a star contemplating life on Mars
Life's a cover magazine I'm an eggshell under feet
Till I see this house under pale blue skies
With golden fields that will burn your eyes
So let's take a drive underneath the sun
New intentions all around put the brakes on slow it down
Trying to find a new release find a space that you can breath
But I've seen this house under pale blue skies
With golden fields that will burn your eyes
So let's take a drive underneath the sun
But don't come around pulling me down telling the world how I let you down
Just tell all your friends I wanna dream with you
So tell all your friends and neighbours too CNN BBC world news
Tell all your friends I wanna dream with you
Tell all your friends tell all your friends tell all your friends
I don't wanna sit here catching flies
Cause I've seen this house under pale blue skies
With golden fields that will burn your eyes
So let's take a drive underneath the sun
But don't come around pulling me down telling the world how I let you down
Just tell all your friends I wanna dream with you
So tell all your friends and neighbours too CNN BBC world news
Tell all your friends I wanna dream with you
Tell all your friendsEmbed
