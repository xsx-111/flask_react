Bug LyricsMother Earth can you feed us now feed me now feed me now
Mother Earth can you see us now hold me down hold me down
Revolution revolution revolution revolution
Mother Earth can you feed us now burst the bug be forever loved
Hold me down you can't hold me down break the bones throw your stones
Revolution revolution revolution revolution revolution revolution
You gotta fight it
You can fight it no one else will
You gotta fight it
You can fight it no one else will
You gotta fight it
You can fight it no one else will
You gotta fight it
You can fight it no one else will
Feed me now see me now
Mother Earth can you see us now throw the stones throw the stones
Revolution revolution revolution revolution
