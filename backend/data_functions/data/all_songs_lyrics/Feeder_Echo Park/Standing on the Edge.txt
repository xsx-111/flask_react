Standing on the Edge LyricsThere's a message on my bed anew engraving in my overloading head
Feel the walls are caving in as the wire cuts into my butter skin
Overload love's the antidote we need love's the antidote we really need
When you're all by yourself standing on the edge of the world
Take a look at yourself don't fall back in
I thought I shot my conscience dead
But he's come back again to break my china head
Blown a hole right through my dream
Brought me back to earth in a rocket made for one
Overload love's the antidote we need it's the antidote we really need
When you're all by yourself standing on the edge of the world
Take a look at yourself don't fall back in
Cause when you're all by yourself standing on the edge of the world
Take a look at yourself don't fall back in don't fall back inEmbed
