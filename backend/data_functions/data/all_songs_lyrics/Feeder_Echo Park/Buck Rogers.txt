Buck Rogers Lyrics
He's got a brand new car
Looks like a Jaguar
It's got leather seats
It's got a CD player, player, player, player...
But I don't wanna talk about it anymore

I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it, yeah
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore

(Buck Rogers)
(Buck Rogers)

We'll start over again
Grow ourselves new skin
Get a house in Devon
Drink cider from a lemon, lemon, lemon, lemon...
But I don't wanna talk about it anymore

I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it, yeah
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it, yeah
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore
He's got a brand new car
He's got a brand new car
A brand new car
A brand new car
A brand new car
(Buck Rogers)

I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it, yeah
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore
I think we're gonna make it
I think we're gonna save it, yeah
So don't you try and fake it
Anymore, anymore1Embed
