Choke LyricsShe likes big boats big yachts designer throws
She likes big blokes body oil sex that chokes
Her mother left her when she was fifteen out of the nest into the vacuum flow
She got a job working shifts at Sainsbury's packed her bags and left for Monaco
Choke choke choke choke
You're the only pill I take lift me up to where the clouds are snow
Cause you're the only thrill I feed ease the pressure let the whole thing flow
She likes Belgo fashion heads, Saville Row
She likes the cheap sex private jets the Paris glow
Her mother left her when she was fifteen out of the nest into the vacuum flow
Choke choke choke choke
You're the only pill I take lift me up to where the clouds are snow
Cause you're the only thrill I feed ease the pressure let the waters flow
You're the only pill I take lift me up to where the clouds are snow
Snow snow snow choke choke choke choke
You're the only pill I take lift me up to where the clouds are snow
You're the only thrill I feed ease the pressure let the whole thing flow
Cause you're the only pill I take lift me up to where the clouds are snow
You're the only thrill I feed ease the pressure let the whole thing flowEmbed
