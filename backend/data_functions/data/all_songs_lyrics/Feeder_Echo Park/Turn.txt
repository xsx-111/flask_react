Turn LyricsSeeing things going places
Living out of suitcases
Every day's like a dream
I find myself talking to shadows
Taking the train of youth back home again
Cause I don't want to be a hero
But I don't want to be a zero
And I don't want to sit here wasting time
I just want a place inside your mind
I wish that I could turn the clocks right back
It's easy to forget just what you've got
Seeing things going places
Meeting all kinds of faces
Every day's like a scene
I find myself going through phases
Trying to find somewhere that I can be me
Cause I don't want to be your hero
But I don't want to be a zero
And I don't want to sit here wasting time
I just want a place inside your mind
I wish that I could turn the clocks right back
It's easy to forget just what you've got
I'm not trying to find an easy way
Picking up the pieces of a page
I'm looking for a place inside your mind
Cause I don't want to leave it all behind
So come on, give in, there's no beauty in this pain
So come on, connect, we've got to find ourselves again
Cause I don't want to be your hero
And I don't want to sit here wasting time
I just want a place inside your mind
I wish that I could turn the clocks right back
It's easy to forget just what you've got
I'm not trying to find an easy way
Picking up the pieces of a page
I'm looking for a place inside your mind
Cause I don't want to leave it all behind
And I don't want to sit here wasting time
I just want a place inside your mind
I wish that I could turn the clocks right back
It's easy to forget just what you've got
I'm not trying to find an easy way
Picking up the pieces of a page
I'm looking for a place inside your mind
Cause I don't want to leave it all behindEmbed
