Piece by Piece LyricsSitting on a corner street
Children playing at my feet
See the smiles on ice cream faces
Feel myself begin to sink
As the wind blows through my skin
Leaves me open to temptation
Cause nothing ever lasts forever
We're like flowers in this vase together
You and me it's pulling me down
Tearing me down piece by piece
And you can't see that it's like a disease
Killing me now it's so hard to breathe
Sucking back a cigarette
Thinking about new regrets
Trying to be someone you'd like to be
Passing faces on the road
Where the hell can we still go
Leaves us open to temptation
Cause nothing ever lasts forever
We're like flowers in this vase together
You and me it's pulling me down
Tearing me down piece by piece
And you can't see that it's like a disease
Killing me now it's so hard to breathe
It's so hard to breathe
But it's worth fighting for, it's still worth fighting for
It's worth fighting for
Cause nothing ever lasts forever
We're like flowers in this vase together, Here
You and me it's pulling me down
Tearing me down piece by piece
And you can't see that it's like a disease
It's killing me now it's so hard to breathe
You and me it's pulling me down
Tearing me down piece by piece
And you can't see that it's like a disease
It's killing me now it's so hard to breatheEmbed
