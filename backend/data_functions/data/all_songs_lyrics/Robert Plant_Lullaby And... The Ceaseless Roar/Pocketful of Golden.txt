Pocketful of Golden LyricsAnd if the sun refused to shine
Upon my island home
And darkness fell upon the earth
And once again walk alone
I have pockets full of golden
A little more with every day
Inside my coat a silver lining
Who knows the price I have to pay
Once I was set upon by thieves
You know they stole my heart away
I finally found it in your arms
And that's just where it's going to stay
I wondered high upon the mountain
With the naked and the free
And if I bare my soul in asking
One day she'd care for me
Red hair, raven hair, gold like the sun
All of us in motion, moving on and gone
And I was cast out on the ocean
Adrift to count the seven seas
So all alone, so high and lonesome
Maybe, one day, she'll care for me
'Cause I have pockets full of golden
A little more with every day
Inside my coat a silver lining
Who knows the price I have to pay
Red hair, raven hair, gold like the sun
All of us in motion, moving on and gone
Red hair, raven hair, gold like the sun
All of us in motion, moving on and gone
Red hair, raven hair, gold like the sun
All of us in motion, moving on and goneEmbed
