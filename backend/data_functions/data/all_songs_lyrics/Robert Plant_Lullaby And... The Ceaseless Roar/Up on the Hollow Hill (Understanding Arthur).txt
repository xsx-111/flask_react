Up on the Hollow Hill (Understanding Arthur) Lyrics
All I want
All I pray
All I crave
Is a love that take my breath away

My deep fall
Turn to clay
Through this time love take my breath away
Through all time love take my breath away

All my blood returns high up on the hollow hill

When love go
War's fired up
Wash away
Let the tides of love my life away

My eyes
My life
