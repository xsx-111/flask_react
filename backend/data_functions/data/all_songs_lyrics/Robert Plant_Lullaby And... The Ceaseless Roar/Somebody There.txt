Somebody There LyricsWhen I was a young boy
And time was passing by real slow
And all around was wonder
And all around, the great unknown
With eyes that slowly opened
I set about the wisdom for to know
And living out of language
Before one word I spoke, I heard the call
'Cause there is somebody there, I know
There is somebody there, I know it's so
There is somebody there, I know
There is somebody there, I know it's so
Now high upon the mountain
Where green has turned to golden, shine on so
Below the world's unfolding
Unraveled and exploding, it was always so
I'm rolling and I'm tumbling
Through all your fields of plenty, here I go
Come walk a mile beside me
Come love me and come guide me, hear the call
'Cause there is somebody there, I know
There is somebody there, I know it's so
And there is somebody there, I know
There is somebody there, I know
The road calls to my heart
Your love will warm my blood
The sun will shine down evermore
Wine is in the cup
'Cause there is somebody there, I know
There is somebody there, I know it's so
There is somebody there, I know
There is somebody there, I know it's so
Oh, oh
Oh, ohEmbed
