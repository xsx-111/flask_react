A Stolen Kiss LyricsHow long has it been like this
Lost and found and lost yet again
Here in the heat of a stolen kiss
I make my home
How long has it been this way
On and on as the days slip away
Oh, lost in language, oh, lost in song
I'm gone
I am drawn to the western shore
Where the light moves bright upon the tide
To the lullaby and the ceaseless roar
And the songs that never die
Love waits for no one, there's so little time
It's cruel and elusive and so hard to find
And moving further and further each day
I'm gone
I am drawn to the western shore
Where the light moves bright upon the tide
To the lullaby and the ceaseless roar
And the song that never diesEmbed
