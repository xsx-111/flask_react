Little Maggie LyricsOh yonder stands little Maggie
With a dram glass in her hand
She's out courtin' with another
With another several men
Oh, the last time I saw Maggie
She was sitting by the sea
With her .44 all around her
And her banjo on her knee
Oh, how can I ever standing
Just to see those two blue eyes
Which are shining like diamonds
Like a diamond in the sky, oh
I'm going down to the station
With my suitcase all in my hand
I'm going away, away to leave you
In some far off distant land
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey, oh1Embed
