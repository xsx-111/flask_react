Poor Howard LyricsPoor Howard, poor boy
Poor Howard, poor boy
Poor Howard, poor boy
Left me here to jump for joy
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Poor Howard's been and gone
Poor Howard's been and gone
Poor Howard's been and gone
And left me here to sing this song, oh
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl with a red dress on, I know
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Where you been since I been gone?
Where you been since I been gone?
Where you been since I been gone?
With the great big man with a derby on?
Mmm, pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Pretty little girl with a red dress on, oh
Pretty little girl with a red dress on
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
All I want in this Creation
Pretty little girl and a big plantation
Four little kids to call me papa
Four little kids to drive me crazy
All I want in this Creation
Pretty little wife and a big plantation
Four little kids to crawl on me
Four little kids to love me
All I want in this Creation
A pretty little wife with a big plantation
Four little kids to call me papa
Four little kids to drive me crazy
Wa-wa
Oh, wa-wa
Oh, wa-wa
Oh, wa-wa
Oh, wa-wa
Wa-wa
Wa-wa
Wa-wa
All I want in this Creation
Pretty little wife and a big plantation
Four little kids to call me papa
Four little kids to drive me crazyEmbed
