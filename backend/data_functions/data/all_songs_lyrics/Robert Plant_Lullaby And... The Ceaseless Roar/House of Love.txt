House of Love LyricsSpeak to me tell me a dream
Why don't you let me know
It's only a key I'm locking it up
I think its got to go

And when I think about it now
We'll build a house of love somehow
Ah, talk to me, back in your grove
You leave me walking the floor
Ah, feels strange to me I'm losing control
I can't feel you any more

And when I think about it now
Build a house of love somehow
It hurts a little too much
It hurts a little too much
Oh, my crazy arms are empty now
So call it dying slow
Oh you're looking at me - I can't forget
You touch my very soul

But when I think about it now
Build a house of love somehow
A little too much
It hurts a little too much
It hurts a little too much
It hurts a little too much
Oh girl, you really do now
Ah, you hurt me child
You know you really do now
You know things get better, baby
Oh, I was running just running so hard
But things get much better baby
It's so hard it's so hard, so hard
Keep a-running, keep a-running, yes
Yes, it gets better, baby
My crazy arms they're empty now
So call that dying slow
Oh, remember me I can't forget
You touch my very soul

And when I think about it now
Build a house of love somehow
Just a little too much
Yeah, too much
It's just a little too much
It's just a little too much1Embed
