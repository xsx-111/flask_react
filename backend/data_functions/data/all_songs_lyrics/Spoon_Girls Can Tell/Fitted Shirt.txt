Fitted Shirt Lyrics
When I was still growing up
And dad head off to work
He put coat and tie on
Over a fitted shirt
Nothing else will fit right
Or seem so directly applied
Than fitted shirt hung on me
Fitted shirt, alright

I long for the days
They used to say
Ma'am and yes sir
For now, I'm going to find
Buttons for my
Dad's old used shirt

Fitted shirt
Fitted shirt

Been looking so long now
And no one's seen and no one heard
But when I go out tonight
I'm going to put on a fitted shirt
One day it'll take
And they'll start to make
Shirts that fit right
Till then I suppose
I still got dad's clothes
And that's alright

Fitted shirt
Fitted shirt
Fitted shirt
Fitted shirt
Fitted shirt
Fitted shirt
Fitted shirt
