Take the Fifth Lyrics
Wendy's walking out alone and it's Saturday night
All the boys act tough but they've got to bite
When they do, they'll get more than a slap on the wrist
And it's clear who's promoting her own myth

So I'll take the fifth
Take the fifth, oh

Everybody talks it up all of Saturday night
And all the kids want to brag, in fact that they got a right
But it ain't going to be just a slap on the wrist
And it's clear who's going to go and promote her own myth

Going to take the fifth
Take the fifth, oh
But I'll take the fifth
I'll take the fifth, oh

In back of the room, when she walk on though
Find them stacked against the wall
On the tip of their tongue is the word that all along could turn around the way it'd fall
The thinking about what she's got
She's about got me backed against the wall
On the tip of my tongue 'cause I knew it all along
I'd be back there if I wouldn't fall
If I wouldn't fall
If I wouldn't fall
Wendy's out on her own, it's a Saturday night
And I've been hanging around as if to save my life
All the girls stand around with their hands on their hips
'Cause all the boys have already fallen prey to her myth

But I'm going to take the fifth
I'll take the fifth, oh
And I'll take the fifth
I'll take the fifth, oh
And I'll take the fifth
I'll take the fifth
And I'll take the fifth
I'll take the fifth, ohEmbed
