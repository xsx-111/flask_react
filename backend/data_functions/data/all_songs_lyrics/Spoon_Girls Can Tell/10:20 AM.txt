10:20 AM Lyrics
10:20 AM, 10:20 AM
When will I ever see you again?
10:20 AM
When will I ever see you again?

I carry you out
It starts to sink in
When will I ever see you again?
You'll be with me still
Ever from now, 10:20 AM
'Cause I remember everything you did
And I remember everything you did
Everything you were
Everything you said
Yeah, I remember everything you did

10:20 AM
When will I ever see you again?
10:20 AM
When will I ever see you again?Embed
