Me and the Bean Lyrics
There's a girl in my yard
Reading to me tarot cards
She don't know anything
But she's beautiful to me

My eyes are opening again
I see you as you're marching in
I'll bring you cover when you're cold
You'll bring me youth when I grow old

Do you remember when you were small?
How everybody would seem so tall?
I am your shadow in the dark
I have your blood inside my heart2Embed
