Take a Walk Lyrics
Tough break and you broke it all right in two
And it won't get back together with stitches and glue
And now, that song's been sung
It's just the cost of what's been done
The cost of taking a walk with you

I can tell myself
This is for all concerned's health
And I may yet dot that 'i'
Fill it up and pour it down the inside
Until you all go and take a walk
And I said all y'all, go take a walk

Tough break had you send me back home to ma
Back to cow town and the fish shop and the mall

Oh yeah, it sent me right back from where I came
And in the interim, nothing changed
So I may yet dot that 'i'
Fill it up and pour it down the inside
And tell you to all go and take a walk
And I said all y'all, go take a walkEmbed
