Anything You Want LyricsIf there's anything you want
Come on back, 'cause it's all still here
I'll be in the back room, drinking my half of the beer
And if you and me's so right
Why's it the same thing every night?
It's just a matter of time
It's almost measurable
Imagination ain't kind on us tonight
You're at your best when you got the guns turned a hundred eighty degrees
And finding out if it adds all up right
We go through all the same lines or sell out to appease
But go to sleep in a bed of lies
I made my own more than once or twice
And now time is my time
Time is my own
And I feel so alive, yet feel so alone
'Cause you know you're the one and that that hasn't changed
Since you were nineteen and still in school waiting on a light
