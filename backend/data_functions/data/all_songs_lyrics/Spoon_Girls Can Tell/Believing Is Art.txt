Believing Is Art Lyrics
Things everybody would say:
Believing is hard
Believing is art
Things everybody should know:
The end will come slow
And love breaks your heart

So welcome to the north side
Where you will see what it means to be standing on line
It's not so out of the way
Just under the east and one stop away

I said that this is a call
Yeah, it might be a call
If the world could sit tight for one night
Get out of the car at the corner of nine
Where they take everything and just spit it all out

I'm staying up late at night
To take apart what I said
To make it all sound alright
Waiting now and taking my time
'Cause I've seen what it means to be standing on line
This is a call
Yeah, it might be a call
And the world is alright and alright
Taking your time and I'm standing on line
It depends, it depends and it comes back again
Yes
They've got my number
They've got me, alright
They know my number
They've got me, alright

Think about it a while
The end ain't that bad
Take out the trash with one hand
It falls apart like a band
Just hold onto it tight

This is a call
It ain't mine, not at all
And the world can sit tight and alright
Taking your time and get right back on line
It depends, it depends and it comes back again
Yes, things that everybody would say:
Believing is hard
Believing is art
Things everybody should know:
The end will come slow
And love breaks your heartEmbed
