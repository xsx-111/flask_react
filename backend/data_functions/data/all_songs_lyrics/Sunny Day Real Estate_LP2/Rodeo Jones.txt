Rodeo Jones LyricsOff of my hand
Flew a snow white dove
Watch it disappear into the sun
Your's a halo
For dreams that turn to dust
Words are all on the page
And tears and blood
Off of my hand
Flew the snow white dove
Into the sun now I'm bleeding
I'm in need of
Shakespeare sang air on air
So I sang
Shakespeare turned dust to dust
So to my life
Words and in between no aims
I call these worms we'll meet someday
Across the ocean where my heart bends
Was it you I saw
Under the pale moon
When we're running from lost love
Leaving punctured skin on the floor
Was it you I saw under the moon
One bleeding heart
To our end
No imagery
Waiting for someone lying
Waiting for my day
My eyes will see
Wait for me
In your misery wait for me
Rodeo...
Rodeo Jones
Your misery, your misery
Wait for me there1Embed
