5/4 LyricsCall me
The sign
Rise and shine
Strange promenade with
Eyes closed
I thought I'd write the book of
Climbing
I'm trying
Alone
While my eyes
I now you're coming back
I can climb without you
I spoke bad poetry
The wrong way, you said
Lay down in my hands
Where promises will never break
But I've lived through
Lay down my life's broken
My lips feel
Incomplete without love
So I go on
And set my life before you
Oh
I'm lost in you
Open my eyes
You set me free
Won't lift me up
You held me
I'm lost in you
You're JesusEmbed
