Iscarabaid LyricsNow they're swerving when I give
And now it's turning away from my impression at all
It's choleric months in baritone
But waiting for the tide out
Right in they're calling me
Words at hiding are revoked
But waiting for this I'll blend in the covering
When it's tried, embarrass
A late song in the late leaf
Things will come anywhere
Inside of me
Outside of you
Waiting closer to there
I'd swear that goes with our dreams
What's wrong with me
Another side of you
In every type a value
But now it's turning away from my impression at all
There was a time when running
I went swimming
And you pulled me to come back
Long weeks hiding melody
And now it's starting awake at my impression at all
The clock strikes hope
And time to bring
But now it's turning into a beast like you
I don't need them
Light the way there
Inside of me
Outside of you
Going closer to there
And swear that you've seen better things
Wipe the slate
What am I to sing?
Many clothes to borrow
To quell that song

Interpreted by Jeremy Campbell
Though it's swerving when I give
The Lord's turning away from my impression that all
Choleric months in baritone
But waiting for the tide out
Right in they are calling me
Words at hiding are revoked
But waiting for the soap and then the cup of rain
Where it's tied, embarrassed
But lay inside the lake
And these things will come anywhere
(chanted in the back round is "Iscar-abaid")
Inside of me
Outside of you
Awaking closer to the light
To swear that those were better dreams
What's wrong with me
Am I tired of you?
Irreverent type of melanoma
There is no turning away from my impression that all
Losing sight when running
I went swimming and you pulled me to come in
Long weeks hiding melaâ€¦.noma (voice drags on this
Part)
Now I'm staring, awake, at my impression that all
The clock strikes twelve and time to breathe
But now it's turning into things I know
Turning them
Lights the way there
Think I'll be there with Him?
Thank you Jesus
(chanted in the back round is "Iscar-abaid")
Inside of me
Outside of you
Carried closer to the light
And swear that you've seen better things
Wipe the slate
Well am I to see
Mary cross my own blood and soul
*I worked and studied this song for about 3 hours
Because I was sure that the previous translations
While good, lacked a few things that I heard. I've
Come to a conclusion that this song is about a child
Who has brain tumors (melanoma). It's basically about
The child coming to grips with his disease. Notice
The line about his impression, and how it develops
Through the song: turning away from my impression, no
Turning from my impression, now I'm staring at my
Impression. Also people with melanoma frequently
Pass out, this explains why he can't take a bath
("waiting for the soap and cup of rain") and also
Explains why he can't go swimming ("Losing sight when
Running, I went swimming and you pulled me to come in")
The end of the song shows the kid losing his life to
The disease and going to heaven where all pain is
GoneEmbed
