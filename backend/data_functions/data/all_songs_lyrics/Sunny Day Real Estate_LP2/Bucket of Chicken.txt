Bucket of Chicken LyricsThe scars tell the memory
The way she moves I'm brought to my knees
And I refuse
So goes for waiting
Her footprints were here
And I return
When will words last?
I found my home
You comfort me
Soon, I look...
They come in me
Hold my thoughts they're all that I have now
Hold my tears they're all that's left for you
If I should fall from grace with you my Lord
Then sometimes...
The sky fell
The pictures scar
What dead men hide
It's all in our minds
I refuse
So goes my something
This story I heard
I return
When will words last?
I found my home
You comfort me
Soon eyes look
They come in and...
Hold my thoughts they're all that I have now
Hold my tears they're all that's left for you
If I should fall from grace with you my Lord
Then sometimes...
This last time for you
Again I return
Hold my thoughts they're all that I have now
Hold my tears they're all that's left for you
If I should fall from grace with you dear Lord
Then sometimes...
Yes I cry for you
Comfort me in my loveEmbed
