Theo B LyricsI had a dream where you still love me, well
It's my imagination
For we reached to one against all white
Left smoke in your eyes
And they were offering me good advice
Try to tie an arrow
Way on top of the statue holding answers (on so...)
Let us sometimes (some time to) fly away
Words will look like this, oh
Here in me
It's her imagination
Untie my hands so I can fly away
To another world and they
Were offering me good advice
Try to tie an arrow
Way on top the statue calling on so... (Answers)
Let me fly
Let us sometimes (some time to) fly away
You shut my eyes but I remain
I was staring naked to your hands
Where were you when I was calling, dear?
And I wear forty rings to grab appeal
I was staring naked to your hands
Where were you when I was calling, dear?
And I will have some medicine (answers)
Anyway, then you hold me, I was in the womb
You....Embed
