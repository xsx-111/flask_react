Waffle LyricsFather may I go so slowly in my own dreams
Standing here alone in the dark know my place
Down where I've gone next time
Show me your glory
Won't go away, won't go away
Then I saw the magic glowing out of your hand
If I could move each letter casting eyes from above you
Last time I have held diamonds in my hand
One time that you were alone
You opened my eyes when I was sleeping, thank you
You tower in the field, every to mourn inside of a dreaming world
So long will tire me till you fell asleep on me
Mother may I go so slowly in my own dreams
Standing here alone in the dark know my place
Down where I've gone next time
Show me your glory
Won't go away, just go away
Then I saw the magic glowing in your eyes
If I could move each letter casting eyes from above
You remind me of a secret place, woe
Then I saw the magic glowing out (of) your name
We'll ask your name, oh
We'll ask your name
We'll ask you're name oh, it's hiding
You'll rise with lettered sky
We'll need so I can seeEmbed
