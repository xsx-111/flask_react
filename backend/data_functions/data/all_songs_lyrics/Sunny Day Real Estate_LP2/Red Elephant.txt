Red Elephant Lyrics
Stay a while with
Running out with (?) time (nine) servants
Trip through the warm wind (part we made)
Through their talking
My impression grows
Suede scars part of our own dream world

We climbed the wreck
Cold hammer heart
Still beating
And though we know not now the reason why
Well I'd suspect
Guilt covered charm
In my hand
My eyes reflect the surface very well

Why'd I (wide eye) compromise
Suede scars untie me slow
The way you restart again
I'm all talk again
When I'm on top of the world
The way you restart with me
An iris field and I say (and I take)
"Go there" (you there)
The years of worry (A lizard worry) aren't my century (one might touch me)
