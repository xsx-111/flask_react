Spade and Parade LyricsThey don't want to stay here any longer
Though I remove, spade and parade
The guilt and bones through my sandcastle
Hide and go seek giants smile
Bowling ball closet horror
Stroll this uncanny heart...
All I have is shattered glass and wire
Tools to teach gypsies colliope...
Now my whole life
Hide and go seek giants smile
Bowling ball closet horror
And they know nothing...
All I had was you
What was and will be...
Nothing has changed
Dying nine roses for tomorrowEmbed
