Little Wig LyricsMy daddy works for no one
He's the big wig (little wig)
He gives the order
And I implement it (little wig)
Is daddy sad, is daddy proud
Singing aloud
Little wig, little dreamer
Is my little wig too big and loud?
Flip it out!
Little wig, little dreamer (little wig)
Little wig, little dreamer
I wanna dream!
The shoes he wear don't fit
They're just too big for me (little wig)
I'd rather shine his shoes
With toil and spit (little wig)
This little wig has a big head
It's big and red
Little wig, little dreamer
Is my little wig aloud?
Flip it out!
Little wig, little dreamer (little wig)
Little wig, little dreamer
I wanna dream!
Little wig takes off to sea
Little wig takes off to France
Come and see my little wig, man!
Come and feel its real, its real sound!
I have opportunities
I miss them all (little wig)
The road to glory
Is just down the hall (little wig)Embed
