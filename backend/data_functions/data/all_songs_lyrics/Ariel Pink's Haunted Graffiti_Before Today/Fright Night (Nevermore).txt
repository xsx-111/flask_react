Fright Night (Nevermore) Lyrics
Sleep walking in the dead of night
Whoa
Black cat crosses your path
You petition the Lord
Knock knock on the door three times
And you knock knock on the door
Said you used to talk to demons with my ouija board
But not anymore

On fright night
On fright night
On fright night

I'm a necro-romantic, I'm a suck-o-yo blood
Are you ready for Freddy
Yeah (Knock on the door)
Knock knock on the door
Three times and you
Knock knock on the door
I used to walk underneath ladders
Not anymore
On fright night
On fright night
On fright night
On fright night

Come on over here pretty baby
My little bundle-o-love
You're driving me crazy betcha' can't get enough
Knock knock knock knock
Knock on the door I said
Knock knock knock on the door
I mingle with the dead with my ouija board
But not anymore

On fright night
On fright night
On fright night
On fright night1Embed
