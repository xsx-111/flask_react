Bright Lit Blue Skies Lyrics
Oh, what is this thing
I call my mind
I look for the things I can't find
Why am I so far from the ground?
My voice is quiet but my
Thoughts are loud

Bright lit blue skies
You're full of lies
Lies

Everybody suffers from
A state of shock
Rub it across your mind
Just like a clock
2:45 and 8pm
I'm sorry but you won't
See me again

Bright lit blue skies
You're full of lies
Lies
Bright lit blue skies
You're full of lies
Lies, lies, lies
You're full of lies2Embed
