Beverly Kills Lyrics
Beverly kills the freaks with her golden arrow
Beverly kills the freaks
Oh!
Beverly kills the freaks with her golden arrow
Beverly kills the freaks
Oh!

Never heard about Beverly's freaks, yeah
Think twice before you meet 'em
Made up of the finest comedians
Ya can't stop no incest from spoiling

Sorry I'm not sorry for your
Dismal waste
Can't stop the press!
No!

Beverly kills the freaks with her poison arrow
Beverly kills the freaks
Oh!
Beverly kills the freaks with her golden arrow
Beverly kills the freaks
Oh!
The houses' prices don't go down
Yet all around
I see them underground
I know a guy used to ball in the league, yeah
He's dancing in the street

Sorry I'm not sorry for your
Dismal waste
I can't stop the press!
I can't break the headline
I can't stop the press!
Don't wanna
Stop the

Beverly kills the freaks with her golden arrow
Beverly kills the freaks
Oh!
Beverly kills the freaks with her golden arrow
Beverly kills the freaks
Oh!

I can't stop the press!
I can't break the headline
I can't stop the press!
Don't wanna
Stop the
Press
I can't break the headline
I can't stop the press!
Don't wanna
Stop theEmbed
