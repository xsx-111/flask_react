Butt-House Blondies Lyrics
Butt-house blondies
She used to care
Butt-house blondies
She used to be a square at sixteen
Now all she knows is that she can breed

She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb

Butt-house blondies
She used to care
Butt-house blondies
She used to be stoned at sixteen
Now all she knows is that she can breed
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb

Butt-house blondies
She used to care
Butt-house blondies
She used to get stoned at sixteen
(Butt-house blondies)
(Butt-house blondies)
Now all she knows is that she can breed

She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumb
She's dumb, and she's dumb
Cuz she really really thinks that
She's dumbEmbed
