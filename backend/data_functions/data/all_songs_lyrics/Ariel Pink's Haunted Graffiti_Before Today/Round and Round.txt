Round and Round Lyrics
Na na na na
Na na na na

It's always the same, as always
Said and tongue tied
It's got a memory and refrain
I'm afraid, you're afraid
And we die and we live and we're born again
Turn me inside out
What can I say

Merry go round (we go)
Up and around we go, up and around we go
Merry go round (we go)
Up and around we go, up and around we go
Merry go round (we go)
Up and around we go, up and around we go
Merry go round (we go)
Up and around we go, up and around we go

Breakdown, break break breakdown
Breakdown, break break breakdown
Breakdown, break break breakdown
Breakdown, break break breakdown
Breakdown, break break breakdown
Breakdown, break break breakdown
You play
(merry go round we go)
Air guitar for a band
(merry go round we go)
And I, I'll break
(merry go round we go)
The eardrums in the back
(merry go round we go)
And I'll back you up
(merry go round we go)
As your frontman
(merry go round we go)

"Hello? Oh, hi."
Now that sounds right frontman write the
Songs that say
"I like that!"

Hold on, I'm calling, calling back to the ball
And we'll dazzle them all
Hold on
Hold on, I'm calling, calling back to the ball
And we'll dazzle them all
Hold on

Pick up the phone
And I want to go
And I want to go home now
Pick up the phone
And I want to go home now

Merry go round (we go)
Up and around we go, up and around we go
Merry go round (we go)
Up and around we go, up and around we go
Merry go round (we go)
Up and around we go, up and around we go
Merry go round (we go)
Up and around we go, up and around we go

Lady lady, come on in
Set me free, come on in
Sentimental heart breaking
Everything is my fault
Sentimental heart breaking
Everything is my fault
Hold on, I'm calling, calling back to the ball
And we'll dazzle them all
Hold on, I'm calling, calling back to the ball
And we'll dazzle them all
Hold on, I'm calling, calling back to the ball
And we'll dazzle them all
Hold on, I'm calling, calling back to the ball
And we'll dazzle them all
Hold on, I'm calling, calling back to the ball
And we'll dazzle them all
Hold on, I'm calling, calling back to the ball
And we'll dazzle them all14Embed
