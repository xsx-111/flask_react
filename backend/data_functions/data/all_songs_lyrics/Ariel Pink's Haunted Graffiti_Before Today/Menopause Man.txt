Menopause Man LyricsMental woman, born of man
Born of woman, mental man
Change me, I'm changing day to day
Lady, I'm a lady from today
Neuter me
Spay my heart
So just come on now
Saturn star
Trying too hard
To be yourself
Said you're trying too hard
To be what you are
Make me maternal, fertile woman
Make me menstrual, menopause man
Rape me, castrate me, make me gay
Lady, I'm a lady from today
Unique
Spay my parts
So just come on girl
Saturn star
Trying too hard
I know you're trying too hard
You're trying too hard
To be what you already areEmbed
