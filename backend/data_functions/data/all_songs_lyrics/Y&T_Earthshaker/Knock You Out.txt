Knock You Out LyricsUp against the ropes
I've been there before
I've been hit by the best, but never hit the floor
Toe-to-toe, you know you should've thought twice
'Cause I've got what it takes
If you wanna stand up and fight
I'm gonna knock you out
Already picked the round
Oh when you step in my ring
You know you're standing on my ground
I'm gonna knock you out
Ain't gonna hold back
Upper cut, left, right yeah
I'm gonna knock you out tonight
Got power, feel what I've done
I've seen a lot like you
On the way to number one
Don't expect me, to turn the other cheek
Get in my way, and you will hear me speak
I'm gonna knock you out
Already picked the round
Oh when you step in my ring
You know you're standing on my ground
I'm gonna knock you out
Ain't gonna hold back
Upper cut, left, right yeah
I'm gonna knock you out tonight
I'm gonna knock you
Yes gonna knock you
You know gonna knock you
Out!Embed
