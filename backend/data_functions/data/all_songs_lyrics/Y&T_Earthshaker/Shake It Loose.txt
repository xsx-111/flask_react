Shake It Loose LyricsAoh...
Alright
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it yeah
Well, I'm all fired up and I'm getting really ready to burn
If you think I'm staying home, you gotta gotta lot to learn
Everybody's jammin' tonight, gonna smoke this town
Can't take it? Don't want you hangin' around
Oh, well I'm ready right now
Shake it loose, shake it loose
All around yes... we're havin' a ball tonight
Shake it loose
Ridin high...
Havin' so much fun, must be against the law
'Cause the music's so loud, it's when it cracks the wall
Ain't leavin' 'till I'm leaving, and I ain't even started yet
Get wild and insane as you can get
Oh, well I'm ready right now
Shake it loose, shake it loose
All around yes... we're havin' a ball tonight
Shake it loose
Ridin' high...
Let's burn one now...
Shake it loose, shake it loose
All around yes... we're havin' a ball tonight
Shake it loose
Ridin high...
Oh, let's shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it yeah
Shake it, shake it, shake it yeah
Shake it, shake it, shake it yeah
Shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake, shake, shake, shakeEmbed
