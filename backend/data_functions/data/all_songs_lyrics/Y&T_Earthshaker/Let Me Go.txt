Let Me Go LyricsBeen so long since I've seen you smile
The way you used to do
Something's changed but it's hard to tell
If it's me or if it's you
Words come hard after all this time
You see there's nothing left to say
Let's face it baby, though we really tried
You know we can't go on this way
Let me go
Let me go
All I want from you, is just to
Let me go
Once lovers now touch
Making love don't mean a thing
Even close feels so far away
Only time will ease the pain
Ain't no use in me hangin' on
Why don't you just let it be
Hate to say it but there ain't no way
But time for you to set me free, yes
Let me go
Let me go
All I want from you, is just to
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
All I want from you, is just to
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
All I want from you, is just to
Let me go
Let me go
Let me go
All I want from you, you got to
Let me go
All I want from you, is just to
Let me go
Oh, all I want from you
All I want from you
Oh, please
Turn me loose...Embed
