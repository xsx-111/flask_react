Young and Tough LyricsHere she comes like a heart attack
The way she looks could kill ya, all dressed in black
With her lips on fire, and a wild hair
She knows the boys are looking, but she don't care
She’s way too smart for an empty lie
Gotta let her know, she's my kind
She's young (She’s young)
And tough
She's got the moves, she's got the stuff
She's young (So young)
And tough
You bet I want it
Some like to talk, some fantasize
They call her cheap and easy, but that's a lie
She's got class, got style
She got on me by a city mile
She's way to fine for an empty lie
Gotta let her know, she's my kind
She’s young (She’s young)
And tough
She's got the moves, she’s got the stuff
She's young (So young)
And tough
You bet I want it
Here she comes like a heart attack
The way she looks could kill ya, all dressed in black
With her lips on fire, and a wild hair
She knows the boys are looking, but she don't care
She's way to fine for an empty lie
Gotta let her know, she’s my kind
She's young (She's young)
And tough
She's got the moves, she's got the stuff
She's young (So young)
And tough
Baby, baby, baby do your stuff
So young (So young)
Young and so tough
You've got the moves, you've got the stuff
She's young (She's young)
So young, and tough
Baby, baby, baby do your stuff
So young (So young)
Young and so tough
You've got the moves, oh baby, baby, baby
Young and tough
You bet I want it
I told you I was bad womanEmbed
