Hungry for Rock LyricsMonday morning is coming all too fast
Weekend's gone, oh how I made it to last
Oh, I wish it would last
Punchin in, I feel like punchin 'em out
It makes me scream, it makes me wanna get up and shout
Ah, they push and shove me all day
Well, I'm hungry for rock
Ready to roll
Yes, I'm hungry for rock
I'm gonna roll all over you
Coming home  starts to me again
A battlezone, a war I just can't win
Oh, seems like I never win
You turn me off, so I turn it up
It sounds so good baby, just can't get enough
Oh, can almost taste it
Well, I'm hungry for rock
Ready to roll
Yes, I'm hungry for rock
I'm gonna roll all over you
Well, I'm hungry for rock
Ready to roll
Yes, I'm hungry for rock
Ah... do it!
Hungry for rock
Ready to roll
Hungry for rock
Yes, I'm ready to roll
Hungry for rock
Ah, so hungry baby
Oh, somebody feed me some rock
Hungry for rock
You know, everybody needs some good hard rock
Hungry for rock
Even  needs some good hard bone rock
Hungry for rock
Feed me that, feed me that rockEmbed
