Rescue Me LyricsI was down, I was barely makin' it
She was gone and I couldn't take it
I was lookin' for a new way of thinkin'
When I go to sleep, I pray I wouldn't wake up
Well, I want you, I want you
To rescue me
The world kept turning
But I stood still
Just a shadow lookin' for the man
Did I play to win?
Or did I win to loose?
Of all the cards I had to draw the fool
People tellin' me
About the things I do
The more I hear
The less I see the truth
Oh, well I'm on the edge
I can't look down
Oh, slippin' slippin' slippin' oh
I want you to rescue me
Oh, rescue me
Oh, you know I want you
I want you to rescue me
Oh, rescue me
A voice faintly callin'
From another time
Ooh, so strange
It sounds like mine
The shades of black
And the twisted road
And I can't see the sky from here
Do I turn around?
Or go straight ahead
I can't stop now
I'll find the light somewhere
Oh, 'cause I'm on the edge, I can't look down
Oh, slippin' slippin' slippin' oh
I want you to rescue me
Oh, rescue me
Oh, you know I want you
I want you to rescue me
Oh, rescue me
I want you to rescue me
Oh, rescue me
Oh, you know I want you
I want you to rescue me
Oh, rescue meEmbed
