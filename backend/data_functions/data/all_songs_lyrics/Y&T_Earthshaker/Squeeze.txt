Squeeze LyricsShe's a crazy lady
She don't put up a fight
She keeps me a rolling and a tumbling
And she squeezes me tight
She knows every little trick in the dir-dirty book
I don't ever want to leave her
'Cause I love to please her
Ah she feels so good
Squeeze
She's an easy woman but she gets me hard
But this honey pie goes too far
She keeps on a humpin' and a pumpin' till I lose control
'Cause my little babies got so much soul
Ah it feels so good
Squeeze me
Ah!
She's a crazy lady
She don't put up a fight
She keeps me a rolling and a tumbling
And she squeezes me tight
She knows every little trick in the dir-dirty book
I don't ever want to leave her
'Cause I love to please her
Ah you feel so good
Squeeze me
Ah!Embed
