I Believe in You LyricsYou came to me
With your love to share
Showed me always that
You'd be right there
Well, the love we shared
And the times we had
Were like a dream, baby, they were never bad
But how I felt has changed with time
And you know my life has ceased to shine
But I'm telling you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
All I want to say to you
I believe in you
I believe in you
The way you are, I love you for
I only wish that I had gave you more
And after all that we've been through
I still see myself right here with you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
All I want to say to you
I believe in you
I believe in you
Your phony friends, they all counsel you
The things they say
Oh, you know aren't true
'Cause even though I've been away, such a long time
Just remember, baby, you remember, baby
When you here me say, I'm telling you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
All I want to say to you
I believe in you
I believe in youEmbed
