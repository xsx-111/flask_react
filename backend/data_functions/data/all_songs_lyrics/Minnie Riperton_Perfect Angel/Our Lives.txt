Our Lives Lyrics
Any day now, can't you see? You'll be comin' back to me
Comin' back to where you wanna be
And the time that you've been gone will vanish like the song
Sung by the rain when we were fast asleep

And our days will be filled by the light of children's laughter
All our nights will be touched by the glow of lovers' souls
Side by side in the sun, we will build the world we're after
Side by side, we will lie when the day's good work is done

Any day now, can't you see? You'll be sittin' here by me
Laughing at the fools we used to be
And the things that we've done wrong will be now dead and gone
Buried out beneath our apple tree

And our days will be filled by the light of children's laughter
All our nights will be touched by the glow of lovers' souls
Side by side in the sun, we will build the world we're after
Side by side, we will lie, when the day's good work is done
I love you
Any day now, can't you see? You'll be comin' back to me
Comin' back to where you wanna be
And the time that you've been gone will vanish like the song
Sung by the rain when we were fast asleep
