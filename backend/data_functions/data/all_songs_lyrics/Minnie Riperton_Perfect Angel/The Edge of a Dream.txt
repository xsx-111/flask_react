The Edge of a Dream Lyrics
The ripples run into the sun
And your smile blends with the clouds that flutter by me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? What do I see?
I see the children playing in the sun
And there is love enough for each and everyone
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! That's what I see!
Ooh

Things that might be (Things that might be)
If we look we just might see (Just might be)
Paint the world so brightly (So brightly)
Let our freedom ring

Merry-go-round without a sound
I hear your song in the breeze that rock-a-byes me
As I sit on the edge of a dream
What do I see? What do I see?
Mmm, I see the Lord inside of everyone
Can it be my dream will really come?
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! That's what I see!
Things that might be (Things that might be)
If we look we just might see (Just might be)
Paint the world so brightly (So brightly)
Let our freedom ring

And here comes the morning sun
I wonder if my dream will really come
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! That's what I see!Embed
