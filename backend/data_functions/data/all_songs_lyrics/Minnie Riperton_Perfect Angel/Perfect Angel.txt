Perfect Angel Lyrics
What we're making is history
Fooling impossibility
Making love, not a fantasy
Love is true, love is you, oh
Making storybook dreams come true
Feeling just enough love for two
There's such magic in being with you
'Cause it's true, loving you, oh

And I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh
And I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh
And I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh
And I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh

Long ago we played hide-go-seek
Kissing under the apple tree
Who could tell me that this would bring
Me to you, you to me, yeah (Ooh)
Since the start, you have been my life
Giving infinite paradise
Every night I wanna thank Him twice for your love
Your sweet love
And I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh
I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh
My mama told me if I was goodie
That I would find me someone to love me
I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect little one
I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh
I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh oh
I think you are the perfect angel
I think you are the perfect one, oh
I think you are the perfect angel3Embed
