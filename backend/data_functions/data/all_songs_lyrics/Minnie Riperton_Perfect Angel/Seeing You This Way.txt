Seeing You This Way Lyrics
Hey!
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la

Seeing you this way, it makes me feel so happy
Seeing you this way, it makes me feel so good
When you come alive, you fill the world with magic
When you move this way, you fill the world with love
Seeing you this way, it makes me feel so happy
I just wanna thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you
Thank you for your love
La, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
I just wanna thank you
'Cause seeing you this way, it makes me feel so good
When you come alive, you fill the world with magic
When you move this way, you fill the world with love

La, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
I just wanna thank you
I just wanna thank you
Thank youEmbed
