Rock And Roll Creation LyricsWhen there was darkness and the void was king and ruled the elements
When there was silence and the hush was almost deafening
Out of the emptiness
(Salvation!) Salvation
Rhythm and light and sound
Twas the rock and roll creation
Twas a terrible big bang
Twas the ultimate mutation
Ying was searching for his yang
And he looked and he saw that it was good
When I'm alone beneath the stars and feeling insignificant
I turn within to see the forces that created me
I look to the stars and the answer is clear
I look in the mirror and see what I fear
Tis the rock and roll creation
Tis the absolute rebirth
Tis the rolling of the ocean and the rocking of the earth
And I looked and I saw that it was goodEmbed
