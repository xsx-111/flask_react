Cups And Cakes LyricsCups and cakes
Cups and cakes
Oh what good things mother makes
You've got to take tea won't you take it with me
What a gay time it will be
Cups and cakes
Cups and cakes
Please make sure that nothing breaks
The china's so dear
And the treacle so clear
And I'm glad that you are here
Milk and sugar
Bread and Jam
Yes please, sir
And thank you ma'am
Here I am
Cups and cakes
Cups and cakes
I'm so full my tummy aches
How sad it must end
But I'm glad I've a friend
Sharing cups and cakes with me
And cakes with me...Embed
