(Listen To The) Flower People LyricsListen to what the flower people say
Listen! It's getting louder every day
Listen! It's like a bolt out of the blue
Listen! It could be calling out for you
Flower people, walk on by
Flower people, don't you cry
It's not too late, No
It's not too late...
Listen! It's like a Mozart symphony
Listen! It's something just for you and me
Listen to what the flower people say
Listen! It's getting truer every day
