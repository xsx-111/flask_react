Sex Farm LyricsWorking on a sex farm
Trying to raise some hard love
Getting out my pitch fork
Poking your hay
Scratching in your henhouse
Sniffing at your feedbag
Slipping out your back door
Leaving my spray
Sex farm woman, I'm gonna mow you down
Sex farm woman, I'll rake and hoe you down
Sex farm woman, don't you see my silo rising high?
Working on a sex farm
Hosing down your barn door
Bothering your livestock
They know what I need
Working up a hot sweat
Crouching in your pea patch
Plowing through your beanfield
Planting my seed
Sex farm woman, I'll be your hired hand
Sex farm woman, I'll let my offer stand
Sex farm woman, don't you hear my tractor rumbling by?
Working on a sex farm
Trying to raise some hard love
Getting out my pitch fork
Poking your hayEmbed
