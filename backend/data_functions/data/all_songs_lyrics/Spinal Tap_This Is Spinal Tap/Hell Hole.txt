Hell Hole LyricsThe window's dirty, the mattress stinks
This ain't no place to be a man
I ain't got no future, I ain't got no past
And I don't think I ever can
The floor is filthy, the walls are thin
The wind is howling in my face
The rats are peeling, I'm losing ground
Can't seem to join the human race
Yeah, I'm living in a hell hole
Don't want to stay in this hell hole
Don't want to die in this hell hole
Girl, get me out of this hell hole
I rode a jet stream, I hit the top
I'm eating steak and lobster tails
The sauna's drafty, the pool's too hot
The kitchen stinks of boiling snails
The taxman's coming, the butler quit
This ain't a way to be a man
I'm going back to where I started
I'm flashing back into my pan
It's better in a hell hole
You know where you stand in a hell hole
Folks lend a hand in a hell hole
Girl, get me back to my hell holeEmbed
