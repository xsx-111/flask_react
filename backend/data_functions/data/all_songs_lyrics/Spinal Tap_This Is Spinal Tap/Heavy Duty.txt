Heavy Duty LyricsNo light fantastic ever crosses my mind
That meditation stuff can make you go blind
Just crank that volume to the point of pain
Why waste good music on a brain?
Heavy, Duty
Heavy duty rock and roll
Heavy duty
Brings out the duty in my soul
I see you dancing there in front of the band
You're playin' the solos with no guitar in your hand
I don't pull no punches I wouldn't waste your time
And just cause it pays, that ain't no crime
Heavy, duty
Heavy duty rock and roll
Heavy duty
Brings out the duty in my soul
I don't need a woman, I won't take me no wife
I get the rock and roll and that'll be my life
No page in history baby- that, I don't need
I just want to make some eardrums bleed
Heavy, duty
Heavy duty rock and roll
Heavy duty
Brings out the duty in my soulEmbed
