Gimme Some Money LyricsStop wasting my time
You know what I want
You know what I need
Or maybe you don't
Do I have to come right flat out and tell you everything

Gimme some money x2
I'm nobody's fool
I'm nobody's clown
I'm treatin you cool
I'm putting you down
But baby I don't intend to leave empty handed

Oh, yeah
"Go Nigel go.."

Don't get me wrong      (Gimme some money)
Try getting me right          (Gimme some money)
Your face is o.k
But your purse is too tight         (Gimme some money)
I'm looking for pound notes, loose change, bad checks, anything
