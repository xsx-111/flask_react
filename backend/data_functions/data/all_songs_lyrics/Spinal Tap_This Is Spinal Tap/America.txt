America LyricsWe came like babies
From our home across the sea to see America
And the people opened up their arms
To welcome us... to America
We came like children
From a far and distant land to see America
And the golden sun of freedom
Filtered down to us, in America
And the people stood and stared
Loved us more than we had dared to, in America
Super highways here and there
Pretty womens everywhere
Brady Bunch and Smokey Bear
Buildings reaching to the sky
Afro-sheen and apple pie
PTA and FBI
Jumbo jet begins to rise
A joyful nation waves its bye-byes
Each religion, race, and creed
Gets exactly what they need
God bless Johnny AppleseedEmbed
