Freeway of the Plains LyricsYou said the price was final
But you're willing to haggle
I fold my arms and wait for you
But you treat me like the rabble
'cause I thought it was love, baby
When I kissed you in the kitchen
It wasn't no dove, just a white pigeon
There's a hole in my pocket
And there's a brand new ruby charm by your silver locket
Kicked in the ass and thinking
Just to never do correction
And when it comes to the gadgets, baby
I hope I made the right selection
'cause I thought it was love, baby
When I kissed you in the kitchen
It wasn't no dove, darlin', just a white pigeon
There's a hole in my pocket
And there's a brand new ruby charm by your silver locket
Atlas shrugged here on planet claire
With his lead umbrella for the acid rain
He put the earth down, and stuck out his thumb
And he hitched a ride out on the freeway of the plains
Won't you bury my body
By the broken dam of reason
And when you chisel my epitaph
Leave out the part about the treason
'cause I thought it was love, baby
When I kissed you in the kitchen
It wasn't no dove, just a white pigeon
There's a hole in my pocket
And there's a brand new ruby charm by your silver locketEmbed
