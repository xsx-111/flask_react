Forty or Fifty LyricsForty or fifty horses
Lying in a lot
Red raincoats and rifles
An epidemic has been stopped
Scientist speaks what are you
Wondering about?
He got where he is by turning
Lab mice inside out
The things we do
And have to do
The things I do for you
And what you do for me too
The "yeah, but I..."
And any other excuse
And if you take it for given
Then what's the use
All his possessions
Around him in his house
Lying beside him his
Companion and his spouse
And in the morning
He dress and go to hell
All activated by
A little timer bell1Embed
