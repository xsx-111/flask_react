What Time Is It? LyricsWhat time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw
Just early, early, early
President, he sweat through his talcum
News paper man, he watch like a falcon
"Ah, look...daddy-o...sorry, Mr. President...look, where ya been, man?"
Use a little english to doctor the spin
What time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw
Just early, early, early
It's my bread and butter
Ain't got no other
It's on the TV
The spin's on me...
Ayatollah, he's hopping mad
Jibber about some damn jihad
Send me back to old Baghdad
Spin Doctor its oh so sad
What time is it?
Four thirty
It's not late, naw, naw
Just early, early, early
It's my bread and butter
Ain't got no other
It's on the TV
The spin's on me...1Embed
