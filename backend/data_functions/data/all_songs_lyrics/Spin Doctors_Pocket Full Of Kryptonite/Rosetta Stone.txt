Rosetta Stone LyricsTake the lowest common denominator
The tiniest grain of sand
Like the first digit of our fingers
Points back to the whole hand
Follow the spear flight
Hurled with any lateral
Throw it on the clifftop
Weaves over the battle
Pill of wax descending the candle
Late at night
You'd feel a rise at this mantle
The catalyst or the detonator
The place where it all again
The bottom floor of the elevator
The grandfather of the middleman
Follow the spear flight
Hurled with any lateral
Throw it on the clifftop
Weaves over the battle
Pill of wax descending the candle
Late at night
You'd feel a rise at this mantle
Waxing givers
Slip between the sheets of minds
Rosetta stone
Like the skeleton
Reassembled bone by bone by bone by bone
Follow the spear flight
Hurled with any lateral
Throw it on the clifftop
Weaves over the battle
Pill of wax descending the candle
Late at night
You'd feel a rise at this mantleEmbed
