More than She Knows Lyrics
One, two

I know she's got everything she wants
I know she's got everything she needs
I know she needs me more than she knows
I know she's got everything she wants
I know she's got everything she needs
I know she needs me more than she knows

She come on so sweet and kind
I wonder if I'm on her mind
She always turns away
I know I'll get her one of these days

I know she's got everything she wants
I know she's got everything she needs
I know she needs me more than she knows, hey


I know she's got everything she wants
I know she's got everything she needs
I know she needs me more than she knows
Yeah, more than she knows, yeah
More than she knows
More than she knows, yeah
More than she knows
