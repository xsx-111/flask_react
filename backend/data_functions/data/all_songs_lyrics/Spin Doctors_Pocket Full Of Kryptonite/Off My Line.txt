Off My Line Lyrics
I've been thinking lately how to get you off my line
Don't seem all that easy, but it feels alright
I've gotten rid of expectations that I used to have
And we don't get along, oh, it really ain't that bad, yeah

Somewhere in between the blue and the red
"This is temporary," that's all she said now
Someday things may be a little better than before
All these mysteries and they're knocking at my door

Alone in my room, I lay awake and dream
Sleeping half awake, I got to try to explain
That I don't need your love and it means this much to me
I don't need your love, woman, won't you see

That I'm somewhere in between the blue and the red?
"This is temporary," that's all she said now
Someday things may be a little better than before
All these mysteries and they're knocking at my door

She must not realize
What this means to me
I figured out her disguise
Hey, mama, I'm not dreaming, nah
I've been thinking lately how to get you off my line
Don't seem all that easy, but it feels alright
I got rid of expectations that I used to have
And we don't get along, no, it really ain't that bad, yeah

Somewhere in between the blue and the red
"This is temporary," that's all she said now
Someday things may be a little better than before
All these mysteries and they're knocking at my doorEmbed
