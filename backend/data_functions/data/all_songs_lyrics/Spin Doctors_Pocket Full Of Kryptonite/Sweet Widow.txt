Sweet Widow LyricsZephyr through the awning shadow
Star-like glimpse upon the weeping leaves
Rest yourself my weeping widow
With the your news of grave defeat
With the shafts of each fraction
Beneath your head in rays of hair
Fire hand the mango nectar
And the news is good
Sleep oh
Sleep oh
Lay down your head and sleep oh, sleep
Lay down your head and
Across these fields of amber grain
Never that we've reached the dawn
You whispered that your vows to him
Were crushed as the shafts we played upon
Then came the news, I knew it'd come
It was a cruel and clever thief
Devised this cunning tragedy
Stole you for me to love sweetpea
Sleep oh
Sleep oh
Lay down your head and sleep oh, sleep
Lay down your head and
