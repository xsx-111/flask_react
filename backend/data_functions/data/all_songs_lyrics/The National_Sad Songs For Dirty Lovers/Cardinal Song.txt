Cardinal Song LyricsNever look her in the eyes
Never tell the truth
If she knows you're paper
You know she'll have to burn you
Never tell the one you want that you do
Save it for the deathbed
When you know you kept her wanting you
And do everything she'd never do
Fall asleep with stranger's wives
The wild wives of unknown men
Good for you, you've just become
Just another one of them
Never say you miss her
Never say a word
And do everything she'd never do
Don't let her see your cardinal eyes
Let her treat you like a criminal
So you can treat her like a priest
Girls forgive my human mind
Girls forgive me one more time
Never tell the one you love that you do
Save it for the deathbed
And do everything she'd never do
Don't let her see your cardinal eyes
Don't let her see your cardinal eyes
Jesus Christ you have confused me
Cornered, wasted, blessed and used me
Forgive me girls I am confused
Stiff and pissed and lost and loose
Jesus Christ you have confused me
Cornered, wasted, blessed and used me
Forgive me girls I am confused
Stiff and pissed and lost and looseEmbed
