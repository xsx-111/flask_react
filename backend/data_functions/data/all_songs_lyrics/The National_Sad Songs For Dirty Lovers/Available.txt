Available Lyrics
Did you clean yourself
For me last night?
Put the water out and donned a marigold
In your hair to bring me here
And tie one on you

Did you dress me down and liquor me up
To make me last for the minute
When the red comes over you?
Like it does when you're filled with love
Or whatever you call it

Do you feel alone when I'm in my head
While you wait for me
To take my breath?
Do you still feel clean
When the only dirt is the dirt I left?
How can you blame yourself
When I did everything I wanted to?

You just made yourself available
You just made yourself available
Why did you dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Dress me down?
Why did you dress me down?
Dress me down?
Dressed down and liquor me up?
And liquor me up?
And liquor me up?
And liquor me up?Embed
