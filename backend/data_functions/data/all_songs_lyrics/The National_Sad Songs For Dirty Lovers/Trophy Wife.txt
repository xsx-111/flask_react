Trophy Wife LyricsNo, nobody wants to be
No, no one's lover
No matter what they say
Lovers know they are the ones
Who one day have to go
Trophy wives, I know they wander
And find a young, young man
Trophy wives, I know they wander
One time you were a good rabbit
To all the girls
And all their lovely mothers
You tried a piece of everything
Now nothing turns you on
Trophy wives, I know they wander
And find a young young man
Trophy wives, I know they wander
Run, run, baby, I don't feel alive
But I'm pretty and I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna be alright to drive
To New Jack City for a younger man
With a better brain
I, I fell in love with you
No matter what you say
But you were right about the reasons
I don't want to be
What I'm becoming
Your trophy wife, I know they wander
And find a young, young man
Your trophy wife
I know they wander
And find a young man
Your trophy wife
I know they wanderEmbed
