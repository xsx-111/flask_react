Thirsty Lyrics
As far as I can tell
I'm nothing like a princess
But today I find myself
Curling up behind the house
There's nothing in the air today
Now I know I'm not so important

Take these girly arms
And ever keep me
Take these girly arms
And ever keep me

I don't have a hawk in my heart
No dumbass dove in my brain
I don't have a hawk in my heart
No dumbass dove in my dumbass brain

Take these girly arms
And ever keep me
Take these girly arms
And ever keep me
I don't have a hawk in my heart
No, I don't have a hawk in my heart
No, I don't have a hawk in, I don't have a hawk in, I don't have a hawk in my heart
No, I don't have a hawk in my heart
I don't have a hawk in my heart
No, I don't have a hawk in, I don't have a hawk in, I don't have a hawk in my heart
I don't have a hawk in my heart
In my heart, In my heart (I don't have a hawk in my heart)
No, I don't have a hawk in my heartEmbed
