It Never Happened LyricsWe look younger than we feel
And older than we are
Now nobody's funny
No god, they took our fashion week
That's a real bad thing
'Cause we have scars to cover
Now I forget how to think
So crack my skull
Rearrange me
Lover put me in your beautiful bed
And cover me
Lover put me in your beautiful bed
Nothing made a sound in Williamstown that night
And all the air was empty
Then what to my wondering eyes should appear
Nothing, 'cause nothing ever happens here
Now I forget how to think
So crack my skull
Rearrange me
Lover put me in your beautiful bed
And cover me
Lover put me in your beautiful bed
Nothing ever happened here
Nothing ever happened here
Bad things never happen to the beautiful
Nothing ever happened hereEmbed
