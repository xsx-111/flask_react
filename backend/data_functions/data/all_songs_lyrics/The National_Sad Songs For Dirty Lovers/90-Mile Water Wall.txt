90-Mile Water Wall Lyrics
Well, I know that you know
That you've become the target of this hand
With never even asking
Well, I know that you know
That you're the only thing that I can stand
So how could your hair
Have the nerve to dance around like that, blowing?
And how could the air
Have the nerve to blow your hair around like that?

I'm waiting for a 90-mile water wall
To take me out of your view
I'm looking for a trapdoor trigger
To drop me out of your view

Yes, I'm listening, I'm listening
I can tell that you are serious
You're looking for that hurt look around my mouth
The look of a steep fall, yeah, that's how Hersey put it
So you can make another claim
Well, go ahead and make it
So you can make another claim
Well, go ahead and make it
I'm just waiting for a 90-mile water wall
To take me out of your view
I'm praying for a trapdoor trigger



Yes, I'm listening
I can tell you're seriousEmbed
