Slipping Husband LyricsSit down, dear, we gotta talk, you're acting like a kid
We don't wanna hear about the things you never did
You could have been a legend, but you became a father
That's what you are today, that's what you are today
Spending all your time, somewhere inside your head
Haunted by the important life you could have lead
But your kisses aren't enough to keep your kids in line
So you better straighten out yourself and give your baby time
Cause if you don't give her what she needs
She'll get it where she can, cause she's lonely, man
Don't, don't leave yourself alone, for too many days
Cause sooner than you know you're gonna start, slipping
You'll end up talking to the ghost of your wife as if you knew her
Your eyes will put her everywhere
And spending all your time somewhere inside your head
Haunted by the important life you could've lead
You'll fuck yourself to clear your head
You'll close your door and go to bed
You'll try to sleep without a dream
Cause that's where she finds you
Yeah that's where she finds you
Don't leave yourself alone, for too many days
Sooner than you know you're gonna start, slipping
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us
(Don't forget the alcohol, oooh baby, oooh baby, oooh baby, oooh baby, oooh baby)2Embed
