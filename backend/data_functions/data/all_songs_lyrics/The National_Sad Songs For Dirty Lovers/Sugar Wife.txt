Sugar Wife LyricsSugar wife, sugar wife
Sugar wife, can you make me a man
Baby doll, can you make me a dad
I'm no butterfly, I'm no butterfly
I'm no butterfly, I'm no butterfly
If you tried to make a miracle
You never shoulda tried
If you tried to make a miracle
Sugar wife, baby doll
Can you make me a man
Can you make me a dad
Can you make me a man, can you make me a dad
