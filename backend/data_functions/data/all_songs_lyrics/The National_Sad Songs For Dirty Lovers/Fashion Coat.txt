Fashion Coat LyricsIn a fashion coat I, I float down my city
Don't you think I look pretty anymore
I'll do everything to you, but I can hardly come
'Cause I'm so afraid of you, falling
I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow
I'm not stupid, I swear
I read the foreign news to understand my nation
You get two options in the You Estates
Black city bloodbath or white country rape
I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow
I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow
Everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Oh, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Yeah, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Yeah, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in itEmbed
