Good Golly Miss Molly Lyrics
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call

From the early, early morning
To the early, early night
When you caught Miss Molly
Rocking at the House of Blue Lights

Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call

Momma, pappa told me
"Son, you better watch your step"
If they knew about Miss Molly
I'd have to watch my pap myself

Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call
Ahhhhh!

Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
Oh, when you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call

I am going to the corner
Going to buy a diamond ring
Would you pardon me
Kiss me, make me ting-a-ling-a-ling

Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball
When you're rocking and rolling
Can't hear your mama call1Embed
