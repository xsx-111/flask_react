Ohh! My Soul Lyrics
Ooh! My soul

Baby baby, baby baby, baby
Don't you know my love is true?
Honey honey, honey honey, honey
Get off of that money

Love love, love love, love
Ooh! My soul







Kiss kiss, kiss kiss, kiss
Ooh! My soul

Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me
Give me all the love you got
Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me
You got the best of loving now
