Baby Face Lyrics
Hmm, baby face
You've got the cutest little, hmm, baby face
There's not another who could take your place
Hmm, baby face, you start my heart a-jumpin'
You sure have started somethin'
Hmm, baby face
I'm up in Heaven when I'm in your warm embrace
I didn't need a shove
Because I, I fell in love
With that cute little, little baby face

Hmm, baby face
You've got the sweet little, little baby face
There's not another who could take your place
Hmm, hmm, baby face, you start my heart a-jumpin'
You sure have started somethin'
Hmm, baby face
I'm up in Heaven when I'm in your warm embrace
I didn't need a shove
'Cause I, I fell in love
With a cute little, little baby face

Hmm, baby face
You've got the sweet little, little baby face
I'm up in Heaven with your baby face
Hmm, baby face
You sure have started somethin'
You start my heart a-jumpin'
Hmm, baby face
I'm up in Heaven when I'm in your warm embrace
I didn't need a shove
'Cause I fell in love
With your sweet little baby faceEmbed
