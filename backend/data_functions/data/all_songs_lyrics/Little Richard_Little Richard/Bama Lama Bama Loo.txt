Bama Lama Bama Loo LyricsBama lama bama loo
Got a girl named Lucinder, we call her the great pretender
Got a girl named Lucinder, we call her the great pretender
And when she talks, she says bama lama loo
Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo
Bama lama, bama loo, bama lama, bama loo
Now I dig her style, she's like a drive me wild with
Bama lama, bama loo
I asked my baby for kiss, she shook her head like this
I asked my little girl for kiss, she shook her head around like this
She said woooo-oh, yeah
Bama lama, bama loo, ...
Now I dig that style, its drivin' me wild with
Bama lama, bama loo
I asked my baby for kiss, ...
Bama lama, bama loo, ...
Now I dig that style, now I'm drivin' her wild with
Bama lama, bama looEmbed
