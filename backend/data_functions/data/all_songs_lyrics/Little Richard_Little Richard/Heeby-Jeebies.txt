Heeby-Jeebies Lyrics
Bad luck baby put the jinx on me
I got the heeby jeebies and I can't get well
I got the heeby jeebies and it's you I got to tell
If I can't find my baby, then you know darn well
I'm going to ring your door till I break your bell

You got to jump back, jump back, heeby jeebies
Got to get back, get back, heeby jeebies
Got to jump back, jump back, heeby jeebies
Got to get back, get back, heeby jeebies
Got to jump back, jump back, heeby jeebies
Got my bad luck baby put the jinx on me

I got the heeby jeebies because I love you so
I got the heeby jeebies why do you have to go
If you don't want me, darling, just let me know
Then I won't be a fool over you know more
You got to jump back
I got the heeby jeebies and I feel so sad
I got heeby jeebies why you make me mad
If you open the door and let me in
Then I won't say you put the jinx on me again
You got to jump backEmbed
