Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey Lyrics
Going back to Birmingham
Way down in Alabama

Must be my old aunt Mary
And my good old uncle Sam

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, baby, hey child, hey now
Yes, tell me, baby
What's been wrong with you?

Well, bye, bye, bye, baby, bye
So long, bye, bye, baby I'm gone
Well, bye, bye, bye, baby, bye

Well, I'm hollering and screaming
Baby, please come homeEmbed
