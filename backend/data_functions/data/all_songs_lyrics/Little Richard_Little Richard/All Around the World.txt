All Around the World Lyrics
All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
You can hear those jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

They do the Baja
The Texas ha ha
Shim, sham, shimmy
And they never, never stop

All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
You can hear those jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

They never know time for romance
They only wanna dance
People all holla when they hit that floor
Go, cat, go
All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
You can hear those jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

They never know time for romance
They only wanna dance
People all holla when they hit that floor
Go, cat, go

All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
You can hear those jukebox jumping
All night and all through the day

They never know time for romance
They only wanna dance
People all holla when they hit that floor
Go, cat, go
All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
All around the world
Rock and roll is on its way
You can hear those jukebox jumping
All night and all through the dayEmbed
