Blue Spotted Tail Lyrics
Why in the night sky are the lights hung?
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun?
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one
Why in the night sky are the lights hung?

Why is life made only for to end?
Why do I do all this waiting then?
Why this frightened part of me that's fated to pretend?
Why is life made only for to end?

In the city only for a while
Here to face the fortune and the bile
I heard you on the radio, I couldn't help but smile
In the city only for a while

Why in the night sky are the lights hung?
Why is the Earth moving 'round the sun?
Floating in the vacuum with no purpose, not a one
Why in the night sky are the lights hung?6Embed
