The Plains / Bitter Dancer LyricsJust as the sand made everything round
Just as the tar seeps up from the ground
Bitter dancer, ever turning
So was the day that you came to town
You took a room and you settled in
Washed off the chalk from your weathered skin
Daylight sleeper, bloody reaper
You took a room and you settled in
I should have known one day you would come
All of us walk so blind in the sun
Midnight feeder, beggar pleader
I should have known one day you would come
Tell me again my only son
Tell me again what have you done
At arm's length
I will hold you there
There
At arm's length
I will hold you there
