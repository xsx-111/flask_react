Grown Ocean Lyrics
In that dream, I'm as old as the mountains
Still as starlight reflected in fountains then
Children grown on the edge of the ocean
Kept like jewelry, kept with devotion
In that dream moving slow through the morning time

You would come to me then, without answers
Lick my wounds and remove my demands for now
Eucalyptus and orange trees are blooming
In that dream, there's no darkness a-loomin'
In that dream, moving slow through the morning time

In that dream I could hardly contain it
All my life I will wait to attain it
Then, then, then, oh

I know someday the smoke will all burn off
All these voices I'll someday have turned off then
I will see you someday when I've woken
I'll be so happy just to have spoken
I'll have so much to tell you about it then
Ah, ah, ah
In that dream I could hardly contain it
All my life I will wait to attain it
Then, then, then, oh

Wide-eyed walker, don't betray me
I will wake one day, don't delay me
Wide-eyed leaver, always going2Embed
