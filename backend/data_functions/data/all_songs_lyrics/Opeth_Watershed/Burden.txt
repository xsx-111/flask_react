Burden Lyrics
I once upon a time carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye, a broken rhyme I'd underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

Sorrow in me

Saw a movement in their eyes
Said, I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost, a passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail


Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear, you've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you
