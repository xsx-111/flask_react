No Name #3 Lyrics
We arrived too late
Our mouths were opening
I turned off the light
So, come on, night

You're a witness, you
You've seen me interrupt
A good, old-fashioned fight
So, come on, night

Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion

Watched the dying day
Blushing in the sky
Everyone is uptight
So, come on, night

Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
I know we're not
Illegitimate
In our hearing
So, come on
So, come on, night4Embed
