No Name #2 Lyrics
Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
"Do you know who you're talking to?"
"No, and I don't care who"
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said, "Do what you have to do"

All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
"Please say no more
I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete"
Her name was just a broken sound
A stutter step you hear when you're falling down

Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying

You better start watching what message that you send out
No more situations I only go in to be kicked out
He got knocked down leaving like he ran into a clothesline
And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime
"You were just fine
You'll be just fine
But I'm on the other line"
Killing time won't stop this crying1Embed
