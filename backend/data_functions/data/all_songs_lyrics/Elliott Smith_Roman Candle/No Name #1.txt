No Name #1 Lyrics
At a party he was waiting
Looking kind of spooky and withdrawn
Like he could be underwater
The mighty mother with her hundred arms
Swept all aside
I hate to walk behind
Other people's ambitions
I saw you waiting

Saint-like, with your warning

Leave alone
You don't belong here

Got nervous, started whistling
Every thought a ricochet
Did you notice? Well, I wondered
What's the worst thing I could say?
Froze up inside
"You remind me of
Someone's daughter," I forgot her
I forgot her name, ashamed
Go home and live with your pain

Leave alone
Leave alone
Because you know you don't belong
You don't belong here

When I go, don't you follow

Leave alone
Leave alone
Because you know you don't belong
You don't belong here

Slip out quiet
Nobody's looking
Leave alone
You don't belong here1Embed
