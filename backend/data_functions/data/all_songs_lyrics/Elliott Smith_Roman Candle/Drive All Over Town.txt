Drive All Over Town LyricsTwo-dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Dirty, stepped-on, lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half-light
He looks all wrong, but that's her alright
Look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight
He knew the one time with the army captain
He got over that whole deal before it happened
And it's okay, I knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
When it's 3 AM, he wonders where in the hell she went
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
Until he tracks her down
He'll drive all over town2Embed
