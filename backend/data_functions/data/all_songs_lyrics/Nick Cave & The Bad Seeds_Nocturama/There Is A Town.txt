There Is A Town Lyrics
There is a town
Where I was born
Far far away
Across the sea
And in that town
Where I was born
I would dream
That one day
I would leave
And cross the sea

And so it goes
And so it seems
That God lives only in our dreams
In our dreams

And now I live
In this town
I walk these dark streets
Up and down, up and down
Under a dark sky
And I dream
That one day
I'll go back home
And so it goes
And so it seems
That God lives only in our dreams
In our dreams1Embed
