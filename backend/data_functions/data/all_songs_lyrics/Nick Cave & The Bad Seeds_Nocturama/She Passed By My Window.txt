She Passed By My Window Lyrics
She passed by my window
Her eyes were all aglow
And bent to pick her glove she'd dropped
From the bright and brittle snow
Nature had spoken it in the Spring
With apple, plum and brand new pear
Have you time for my company?
No, I said, I have none to spare

You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
I ain't no lover-boy

For apple, plum and brand new pear
Soon wither on the ground
She slapped the snow from off her glove
And moved on without a sound

You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
You gotta sanctify my love
I ain't no lover-boyEmbed
