Shoot Me Down Lyrics
A most sentimental night
You hold me in your sights
Shoot me down
And though there ain't no enemy here
You keep me very near
And shoot me down
Shoot me down
Your hands, they flutter up
Armed and dangerous, my buttercup
Shoot me down
In flames

Stand back, baby, stand back and let me breathe
I think I'm falling out of here
I can hear the grass grow
I can hear the melting snow
I can feel your breath against my ear
I might just disappear
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?
Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?
Well, wouldn't that be nice?

I look into your eyes
And it comes as no great surprise
You're gonna shoot me down
Shoot me down
I know that when you smile
It'll only be just a short little while
Shoot me down
In flames
Shoot me down
In flames
Shoot me down
In flamesEmbed
