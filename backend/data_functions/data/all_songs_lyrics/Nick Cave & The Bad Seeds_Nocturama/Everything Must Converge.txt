Everything Must Converge Lyrics
Everything must converge
In time
And so it goes, by and by
Everything must converge
Some day
Somehow, some way...

Everything must converge
In time
Or so it seems and by and by
Every little thing must converge
It's true
By and by and so they say...
Like the river that runs to the sea
Like the sun going down on me...

Everything must converge
One day
But I hope
And I pray
That everything must converge
It's true
In time
For me and you
Like the river that runs to the sea
Like the sun going down on me
Everything... must converge
Everything... must converge
In time
In time
In timeEmbed
