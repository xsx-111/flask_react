Iron door Lyrics
"Y'all don't give a fuck about people. The media is a rerun. Public opinion's a little girl, it's a toilet paper commercial. It's got nothin' to do with reality"

Clang, bang, clang went the big iron door
They put me in a cell with a concrete floor
Clang, bang, clang went the big iron door
They put me in a cell with a concrete floor
Clang, bang, clang went the big iron door
They put me in a cell with a concrete floor
Clang, bang, clang went the big iron door
They put me in a cell with a concrete floorEmbed
