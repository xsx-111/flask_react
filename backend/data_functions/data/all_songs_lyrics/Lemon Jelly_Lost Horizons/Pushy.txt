Pushy LyricsI don't like people much I get on better with animals
You don't like people much?
Well I like people but I don't get on with them very well
Not a lot of people
Why is this?
I don't know really I just, people don't take to me
I get on much better with animals and things that like, you know
What's happened when you've tried to get on people?
I don't know, I get on with them in school and that, but I just haven't got a knack of being friendly really, you know? I'm quiet, and I haven't got any push in me
Noisy people seem to get on with, you know? Like at school you get noisy people play up and that, and they always seem to get on better and, er, I don't know, I just...
Do you think you have to have push in this world?
Yes I do. I think its hard luck on anybody who's, you know, quiet or can't get on really, you have to be fairly you know, have a lot of push and, cheek about you
But its also sometimes said that the people who work quietly, behind the scenes, are the most important people. They really get the work done, not the noisey ones
Yes that's true
Do you think that's true?
YesEmbed
