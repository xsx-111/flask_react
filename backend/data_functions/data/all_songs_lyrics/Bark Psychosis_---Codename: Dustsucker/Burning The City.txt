Burning The City LyricsOne, two, three, one, two, three, three, three, three, three...
Did you ever hear the one? Yeah, did you ever hear the one
About that bird-girl who went to seed?
She took off from the rooftops and landed next to me
Said she'd seen it all that greed in flames, laughs, she wants to do it again
One, two, three, three, one, two, three, three
One, two, three, three, one, two, one, one, one, one...
Now she's gone to ground, I guess she's sticking around
Where she can't be found, she can't be found
She can't be found, she can't be found, she's kinda soundEmbed
