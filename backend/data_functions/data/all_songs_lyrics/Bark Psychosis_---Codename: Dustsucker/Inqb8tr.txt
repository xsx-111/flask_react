Inqb8tr LyricsI told you, I'm thinking of you
And your twisted heart make a new start
Lift up your weary head, there's only now
Share a word or six, the past has gone
Lift up your weary head, make a new start
What do I tell you? There's only now
And your twisted heart make a new start
The day is gone, the past is night
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?Embed
