400 Winters LyricsLoose rain, let us rest
Where words speak nor confess
Always beside, always besides
For another winding west
We seek and grow apart
Loose rain, let us rest
Where words speak nor confess
Always beside, always besides
For another winding west
We seek and grow apart
Blood disappears where deeds begin
You never stop nor start
Turn out the silent glare
Turn down the silent stare
400 winters never count
Sleep never rusts
A final sign of things to come
You cannot lay your hand upon
It's only ever more
It's only ever more
It's only ever more
It's only ever more
400 winters never count
A final sign of things to come
You cannot lay your hand upon
A final sign of things to come
It's only ever more
It's only ever more
It's only ever more
It's only ever more
It's only ever more
It's only ever more
It's only ever moreEmbed
