Boom Boom LyricsBoom-boom, boom-boom
Gonna shoot you right down
Right off your feet
Take you home with me
Put you in my house
Boom-boom, boom-boom
Ow-ow-ow-ow
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh
I love to see you strut
Up and down my floor
When you talk to me
That baby talk
I like it like that
Boom-boom, boom-boom
Gonna shoot you right down
Right off your feet
Take you home with me
Put you in my house
Boom-boom, boom-boom
When you walk that walk
And you talk that talk
And you whisper in my ear
Tell me that you love me
I love that talk
When you talk like that
You knock me outEmbed
