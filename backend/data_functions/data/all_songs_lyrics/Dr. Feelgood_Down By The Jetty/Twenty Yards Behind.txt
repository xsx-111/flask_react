Twenty Yards Behind LyricsIf you see my baby walking
I'm a walking by her side
Ain't no need to look too far
Because I won't be hard to find
I'm walkin' twenty yards behind her
'Cause I love the way she shakes behind
Everybody stops to see her
When my baby's out takin' a stroll
I see a traffic cop that flags
When a steam roller ran out of control
But when my baby walked by
He jumped up and shouted 'Bless my soul'
Bless my soul
It's all much confusion in the town
When she's passing through
All the cars are going backwards
And the traffic lights change to blue
I'm walking twenty yards behind her
'Cause I'm frightened of the damage she'll doEmbed
