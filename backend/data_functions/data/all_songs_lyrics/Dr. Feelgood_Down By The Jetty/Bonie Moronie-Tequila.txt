Bonie Moronie/Tequila LyricsI got a girl named Bonie Moronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
When she rock and rolls with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bones
I love her, she loves me
Oh, how happy now we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree
Well, I told her mama and papa too
Just exactly what I wanna do
I wanna get married on a night in June
Rock and roll by the light of a Silvery Moon
I love her, she loves me
Oh, how happy (now) we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree
I got a girl named Bonie Moronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
When she rock and rolls with her blue jeans on
She's not very fat, just skin and bones
I love her, she loves me
Oh, how happy we can be
I love her, she loves me
Oh, how happy we can be
Making love underneath the apple tree
Making love underneath the apple tree
Making love underneath the apple tree
She's my one and only, she's my heart's desire
She's a real upsetter, she's a real live wire
Everybody turns when my baby walks by
She's something to see, she really catches the eyeEmbed
