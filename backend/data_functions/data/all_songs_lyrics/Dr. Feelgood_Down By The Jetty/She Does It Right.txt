She Does It Right LyricsIf there's something that I like
It's the way that woman walks
And if there's something I like better
It's the way she baby talks
She does it right
She does it right
She works hard every night just to make me feel alright
She told me not to worry
And there ain't a single trouble in sight
I said you ought to see her jerk
You ought to see her walk on the floor
And when she gets back to her seat
Mmh all the people cry for more
She does it right
She does it right
She works hard every night just to make me feel alright
She told me not to worry
And there ain't a single trouble in sight
I said I'd give her anything
That her little heart desires
Anything she wants
Just to keep her by my side (/satisfied)
She does it right
She does it right
She works hard every night just to make me feel alright
She told me not to worry
And there ain't a single trouble in sight
If there's something that I like
It's the way that woman walks
And if there's something I like better
It's the way she baby talks
She does it right
She does it right
She works hard every night just to make me feel alright
She told me not to worry
And there ain't a single trouble in sight
She does it right (8 x)Embed
