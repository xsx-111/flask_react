Cheque Book LyricsWell my Mum and Papa told me they had some words to say
They said get out, I said I'm leaving anyway
I made some money playing this here guitar
Filled in a form and went and bought myself a car
I've got my cheque book baby
Got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the back
Well I've been here for so long sick of this whole town
Ain't getting younger and it's time I got around
Gotta' go some places I ain't never been before
When I turn that corner mamma you won't see me no more
I've got my cheque book baby got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the back
Well I've been here for so long sick of this whole town
Ain't getting younger and it's time I got around
I gotta' go some places I ain't never been before
When I turn that corner mamma you won't see me no more
I've got my cheque book baby got my bags all packed
If you're comin' with me get in the motor
Throw your suitcase in the backEmbed
