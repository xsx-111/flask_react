Keep It Out of Sight LyricsYou walk right in
Don't see nobody turn around
Get no connections
You're just a face in any crowd
Some let you know
The good times are coming
Just wait until your time is right
Keep it out of sight
Keep it out of sight
You movin' up
Man, the place is getting hot
You just can't lose
With all that stuff that you got
You know the people understand
You got a reputation
Don't wanna argue fuss and fight
Keep it out of sight
You keep it out of sight
You got enough
You got a new thing on your mind
Don't have nobody
You gotta leave the scene behind
You put your foot down on the boards
You don't know where you're going
But your headlights are burning up the night
Keep it out of sight
Keep it out of sight
Keep it out of sight
Keep it out of sightEmbed
