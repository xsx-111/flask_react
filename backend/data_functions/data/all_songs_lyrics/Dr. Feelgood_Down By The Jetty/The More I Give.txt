The More I Give LyricsI don't get nothing to nobody
But I get everything for you
My hopes, my plans
My dreams my friends
And most of my money to
If I got one thing left to give
I swear that I haven't a clue
The more I give the less I get from you
My friends told me that a womans love
Is a most peculiar thing
You treat 'em bad, steal their cash
And they treat you like a dog gone king
I never listened to their advice
But now I must admit that it's true
The more I give the less I get from you
- Break -
My friends told me that a womans love
Is a most peculiar thing
You treat 'em bad, steal their cash
And they treat you like a dog gone king
I never listened to their advice
But now I must admit that it's true
The more I give the less I get from you
I don't get nothing to nobody
But I get everything for you
My hopes, my plans
My dreams my friends
And most of my money to
If I got one thing left to give
I swear that I haven't a clue
The more I give the less I get
The more I give the less I get
The more I give the less I get from youEmbed
