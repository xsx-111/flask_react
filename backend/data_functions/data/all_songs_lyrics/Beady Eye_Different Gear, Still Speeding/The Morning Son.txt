The Morning Son LyricsYou'll never know unless you try
You're blinded by what you idolise
I stand alone, nobody knows
The morning son has rose
He's in my mind, he's in my soul
He's even in my rock'n'roll
I stand alone, nobody knows
The morning son has rose
I'm here to show, I'll help you out
It takes a lifetime, I've worked it out
I stand alone, nobody knows
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
So let it be and give it time
You go your way and I'll go mine
I'll stand alone, nobody knows
The morning sun has rose
You'll never know unless we try
We're blinded by what you idolise
We stand alone, nobody knows
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
The morning son has rose
The morning son has roseEmbed
