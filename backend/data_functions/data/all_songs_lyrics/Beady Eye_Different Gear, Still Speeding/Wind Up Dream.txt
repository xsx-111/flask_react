Wind Up Dream LyricsIf tonight is all we have
Then make the bed with sheets of glass
Let's take it out for one last laugh
Come on, come on
If yesterday's is all we got
We tie our bones in one big knot
Squeeze it out 'til every drop
Is all gone, all gone, come on
It's just a wind up dream, so don't wake me up
'Cause I like what I see with my eyes shut
Solid gold glints in your eye
A cheeky grin that really makes me smile
The world will want a bit
The world will want a bit
It's just a wind up dream, so don't wake me up
'Cause I like what I see with my eyes shut
It's just a wind up dream, so don't wake me up
'Cause I like what I see with my eyes shutEmbed
