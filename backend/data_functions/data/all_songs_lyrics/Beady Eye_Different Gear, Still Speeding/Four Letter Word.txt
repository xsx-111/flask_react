Four Letter Word Lyrics
Sleepwalk away your life if that turns you on
It's only the moment, look away and it's gone
It's about time that your mind took a holiday
You're all grown up, don't you ever wanna play?

Ahh, you've had enough
Of staring out of deaden eyes
Ahh, it's gonna be tough
The battle's on and so is the pride
I don't know what it is I'm feelin'
A four letter word really get's my meaning
Nothing ever lasts forever

Get on your feet we're going out of our minds
The wheels need to roll, the clock on the wall says its time
Call it love, call it whatever you please
It's not what you wanted, it might be just what you need

Ahh, you've had enough
It feels like you've blown a fifty amp fuse
Ahh, it's gonna be tough
The more you have the more you can lose
I don't know what it is I'm feelin'
A four letter word really get's my meaning
Nothing ever lasts forever

Ahh, you've had enough
Of staring out of deaden eyes
Ahh, it's gonna be tough
The battle's on and so is the pride
I don't know what it is I'm feelin'
A four letter word really get's my meaning
Nothing ever lasts forever

And nothing ever lasts forever
Nothing ever lasts forever
Nothing ever lasts foreverEmbed
