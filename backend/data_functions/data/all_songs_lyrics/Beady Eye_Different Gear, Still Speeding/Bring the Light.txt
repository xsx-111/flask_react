Bring the Light LyricsI bring the light, you get to see
You bring the love, it's ecstasy
I see no point in what you're thinking
I'm going out, I'm taking you drinking
I get the call, you get hung up
I'm standing tall, well, fucking tough
It's just your way, you hear me wrong
I hear you say you're getting up, getting up
Baby, hold on, baby, come on
Baby, come on
You're gettin' up, gettin' up
Baby, hold on, baby, come on
Baby come on
You're gettin' up, gettin' up
I bring the light, you get to see
You bring the love, it's ecstasy
I see no point in what you're thinking
I'm going out, I'm taking you drinking
I'm coming in, you're coming out
I'm coming up, you're coming down
It's just your way, you did me wrong
I hear you say you're gettin' up, gettin' up
Baby, hold on, baby, come on
Baby, come on
You're gettin' up, gettin' up
Baby, hold on, baby, come on
Baby, come on
You're gettin' up, gettin' up
Baby, come on (baby, come on)
Baby, come on (baby, come on)
Baby, come on (baby, come on)
Baby, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
(Baby, come on)
Baby, come on (baby, come on)
Baby, come on (baby, come on)
Well, baby come on (baby come on)
Well, baby, come on (baby, come on)
Baby, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on (come on, come on)
Baby, come on (baby, come on)
Baby, come on (baby, come on)
Baby, come onEmbed
