For Anyone LyricsFor anyone who knows
For anyone who's been
Forever in my heart
I'll see you in my dreams
For anyone who loves
For anyone who feels
I'm never giving up
Until the dream is real
I know it's gonna be alright
Forever I'll be by your side
For anyone who knows
For anyone who's been
Forever in my heart
I'll see you in my dreams
I know it's gonna be alright
Forever I'll be by your side
I know it's gonna be alright
Forever I'll be by your side
For everyone who loves
For everyone who feels
I'm never giving up
Until the dream is real
Until the dream is real
Until the dream is real
Until the dream is realEmbed
