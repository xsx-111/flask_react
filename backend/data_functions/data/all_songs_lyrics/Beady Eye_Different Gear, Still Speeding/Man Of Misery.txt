Man Of Misery LyricsWell I’m not sure who's-a knocking at the door
And I fail to see what they want from me
I had a dreadful night fighting for the life
Now I’m a man of misery
You got me on my knees, you're just a naughty little tease
You really knock me out when you're pulling it about
I had a dreadful night fighting with the wife
Now I’m a man of misery
I said the kid's alright, he’s got a ticket to ride
One thing’s for sure, he’ll leave you wanting more, bye bye
I said the kid's alright, he’s got a ticket to ride
One thing’s for sure, he’ll leave you wanting more, bye bye
I said the kid's alright, he’s got a ticket to ride
One thing’s for sure, he’ll leave you wanting more, bye bye
I said the kid's alright, he’s got a ticket to ride
One thing’s for sure, he’ll leave you wanting more, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye byeEmbed
