Three Ring Circus LyricsDidn't walk, could've run
Ain't that enough?
Feel alive out on a limb
Same way as up
I wanna be
What we as people should be
And I wanna see
What's not shown
Could've won, should've lost
And lay down and sung
Change your mind, change your line
Under my tongue
I wanna go
Where we as people should go
And I wanna know
What goes on
In this three ring circus going round (three ring circus going round)
This three ring circus going round (three ring circus going round)
In this three ring circus going round (three ring circus going round)
This three ring circus going round (three ring circus going round)
I wanna be
What we as people should be
I wanna see
What's not shown
Make it home
In this three ring circus going round (three ring circus going round)
This three ring circus going round (three ring circus going round)
In this three ring circus going round (three ring circus going round)
This three ring circus going round (three ring circus going round)Embed
