World Outside My Room LyricsI wake up smiling in my little Eden, pay no heed to the world outside
Take my medication and hide
Whose been smoking cherry cola, somebody trying to live the dream
I rattle as I reach to dust the screen
Out the door it might be snowing in my world it's always June
I don't believe in the world outside my room
Television and dusty windows, fill my head with a happy tune
I don't believe in the world outside my room
I don't believe in the world outside my room
Life in here is a different tempo virtually comatosed
Sitting with the one I love the most
A sleeping dog deserves to lie
She don't feel like a walk today, she just wants to sleep and play
Out the door it might be snowing in my world it's always June
I don't believe in the world outside my room
Television and dusty windows, fill my head with a happy tune
I don't believe in the world outside my room
I don't believe in the world outside my room
Tell me something I know already, no surprises for me today
I'm not ready, I've lost my way
Someday soon I'll get off my sofa, stop dreaming bout
What might have been until then I'll stay serene
Out the door it might be snowing in my world it's always June
I don't believe in the world outside my room
Television and dusty windows, fill my head with a happy tune
I don't believe in the world outside my room
I don't believe in the world outside my room
I don't believe in the world outside my room
Outside my room, outside my room
Outside my room, outside my roomEmbed
