Millionaire LyricsSweet Cadaqu√©s to Figueres, a 40 minute ride
You drive it and I'll spend it, looking out my window
Sweet Salvador, the shadows painted and the light he saw
The way I see it now, so clear like diamonds on the water
Meddle with me and you meddle with yourself
For there is a higher wealth
Love me like a millionaire
Medals on your proud militia rags
You just need to know yourself
And love me like a millionaire
Her faded glamour, out of season as the ages pass
Desperate for inspiration as the months run down like rain
Sweet Salvador, I stood outside your door and saw the lighthouse
Shining in the sun the way the light shines off the water
Meddle with me and you meddle with yourself
For there is a higher wealth
Love me like a millionaire
Medals on your proud militia rags
You just need to know yourself
And love me like a millionaire
Like a lover, like a lover
Like a lover, oh
Meddle with me and you meddle with yourself
For there is a higher wealth
Love me like a millionaire
Medals on your proud militia rags
You just need to know yourself
And love me like a millionaire
Like a millionaireEmbed
