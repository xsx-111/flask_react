The Roller LyricsYou didn't know what to say
It all came at you today
Can't get out your own way
Well hold on, hold on, hold on
I'm hiding out in the sun
I'm getting everyone done
Just me hating no one
Here I come, here I come, here I come
Just call me the roller
I'll squeeze and unfold ya
Call me the roller
I just go to show ya
So you been crawling through a maze
An alcohol lemon haze
I've been watching you for days
You've been outta sight alright, alright
I'll take you somewhere you never knew you'd been
I'll give you something you never knew you'd feel
The only thing is, everything is real tonight, tonight, tonight
Just call me the roller
I'll squeeze and unfold ya
Call me the roller
I just go to show ya
Just call me the roller
I'll come blow you over
Call me the roller
I'm pleased that I know ya
I'll take you somewhere you never knew you'd been
I'll give you something you never knew you'd feel
The only thing is everything is real tonight, tonight, tonight
Just call me the roller
I'll squeeze and unfold ya
Call me the roller
I just go to show ya
The roller, the roller, the roller
The roller, the roller, the roller
The roller, the roller, the roller
The roller, the roller, the roller
The roller, the rollerEmbed
