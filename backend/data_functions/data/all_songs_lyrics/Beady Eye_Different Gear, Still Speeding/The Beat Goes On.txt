The Beat Goes On LyricsThought that I died today, walked off the stage
Faded away up through the clouds
To the gig in the sky and when I arrived
The angels were singing a song
Yeah, you know the one, are you singing along?
Thought I'd know just what to do, that it'd be
How I wanted it to
The Ox and Moon
Were counting me in, I had to give in
Make the thunder and lightning sing
In the eye of a storm there's no right and no wrong
So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on
Thought it was the end of the world, beat with guitars
And all that I understand is air
Through metal and wood, I'm misunderstood
And wasted on money and fame
I'll throw it away just to prove that I can
I'm the last of a dying breed
And it's not the end of the world, oh no
It's not even the end of the day
So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on
So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes on
So long, so long
Someday all the world will sing my song
Still life remains
Somewhere in my heart the beat goes onEmbed
