Standing on the Edge of the Noise LyricsHold on tight, going out the station
Rolling around in anticipation
Saying goodbyes to the ones we feel
And we're dead
Your mother don't know what your father's missing
Your brother don't know 'cause he ain't been listening
Gotta design for killing time
And it's dead
Get you, you got me
I'm standing on the edge of the noise
Get me, I got you
I'm standing on the edge of the noise
Oh, yeah
So many people, so little time
So many reasons, So little rhyme
So let me look at you, some say I'll seek
Don't fine
Get you, you got me
I'm standing on the edge of the noise
Get me, I got you
I'm standing on the edge of the noise
Oh, yeah
Hold on tight, going out the station
Rolling around in anticipation
Saying goodbyes to the ones we feel
And we're dead
Get you, you got me
I'm standing on the edge of the noise
Get me, I got you
I'm standing on the edge of the noise
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Standing on the edge of the noise
Standing on the edge of the noise
Standing on the edge of the noise
Standing on the edge of the noiseEmbed
