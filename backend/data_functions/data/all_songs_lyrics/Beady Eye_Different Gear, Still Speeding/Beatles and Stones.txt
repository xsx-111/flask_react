Beatles and Stones LyricsWell, it beats me, mama
I just wanna rock 'n' roll
Well, it beats me, mama
I just wanna rock 'n' roll
I'm gonna stand the test of time
Like Beatles and Stones
Well, it freaks them, mama
I'm not doing what I'm told
Well, it freaks them, mama
You know I can't be bought and sold
I'm gonna stand the test of time
Like Beatles and Stones
I'm on my way home
Just to get back what's mine
And when I get home
Well, I'll be alright
Well, it beats me, mama
I just wanna rock 'n' roll
Well, it beats me, mama
I just wanna rock 'n' roll
I'm gonna stand the test of time
Like Beatles and Stones
I'm on my way home
To get back what's mine
And when I get home
Well, I'll be alright
What's that you say?
Get out the way
What's that you say?
Get out the wayEmbed
