Kill for a Dream LyricsLife's too short not to forgive
You can carry regrets but they won't let you live
I'm here if you wanna call
Staring at the spot on the wall
It's a beautiful world when you know who you are
You're moving too fast in the back of a car
You're giving it another try
Staring at the deep blue sky
And you say to the driver, "Just drive"
'Cause you've never felt so alive
We open the door
And let out the sound
All that we heard
Was a dream rebound
I'm bouncing off walls
Right here in my mind
I'd kill for a dream tonight
A looking glass heart thrown at the wall
You don't see me but I see it all
It smells so sweet but it's wrong
And everything pretty is gone
Well, here's my glass and here's one for you
'Cause these dark glasses need something to do
You're giving it another try
Staring at the deep blue sky
And you say to the driver, "Just drive"
'Cause you've never felt so alive
We open the door
And let out the sound
All that we heard
Was a dream rebound
I'm bouncing off walls
Right here in my mind
I'd kill for a dream tonight
I'd kill for a dream tonight
I'd kill for a dream tonight
I'd kill for a dream tonightEmbed
