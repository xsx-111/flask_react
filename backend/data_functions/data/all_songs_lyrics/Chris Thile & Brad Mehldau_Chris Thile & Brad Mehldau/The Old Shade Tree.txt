The Old Shade Tree LyricsI hope none of you, think I'm cryin'
As the sweat rolls down my face.
I hope none of you, think I'm losin'
as I'm lapping the guy in last place.
I hope that one of you thanks me this winter
For what some of you would hang me from now.
cause today the sun kissed a layer of skin from your nose. it's cause last night I chopped the old shade tree
down, down

I guess none of you thought of its roots
As the living dead trapped underground
Or of the blizzard above or the hero I'd be
Planting bonfires all around town.
So as the frost licks the layer of skin off the nose
Of your neighbor, remember who chopped the old shade tree
down, down

i hope that none of you, think I'm cryin'
as the sweat rolls down my face.Embed
