Noise Machine Lyrics
Listen, just between you and me
This is the life
Laughing through the still of the night
Child you can take it from me, one of the best
You gotta sleep
It's more clay for the wheel in your head
And better chances the angel watching over us catches a breath
When you're asleep

So I sing, just above the noise machine
Your mother is a hero
We're lucky to be here
Little son, if anything is worth being sung
If there's anything I want you to know
Your mother is a hero
Your mother is a hero

Woke up with you smiling at me
The last of the stars
And the angels plea
Just give me a couple of hours
I'll turn them into another 24 for this baby of ours
Who never sleeps
So I sing, just above the noise machine
Your mother is a hero
We're lucky to be here
Little son, if anything is worth being sung
If there's anything I want you to know
Your mother is a hero
Your mother is a hero
Your mother is a hero
Your mother is a heroEmbed
