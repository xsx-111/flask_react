Scarlet Town Lyrics
Buddy I went down to Scarlet Town
Ain't never been there before
You slept on a feather bed
And I slept on the floor
Buddy, I don't mind a mean old time
Or drinking my coffee cold
But the things I seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul

I look at that deep well
I look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

I spent some time in New Orleans
And in Cairo on a bend
But Scarlet Town a-brought me down
As low as I ever been

I look at that deep well
I look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
I went on down to Scarlet Town
And you promised you'd be my bride
Then you left me here to rot away
Like Polly on a mountainside

I look at that deep well
I look at that dark gray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

Buddy you can hide in Scarlet Town
For a hundred years or more
But the man who knows what time it is
Is knocking at the door
So fare thee well, my old true love
If you ever see me around
I'll be looking through a telescope
From hell to Scarlet Town

I look at that deep well
I look at that dark gray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
I look at that deep well
I look at that dark gray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town todayEmbed
