I Cover the Waterfront LyricsAway from the city that hurts and mocks
I'm standing alone by the desolate docks
In the still and the chill of the night
I see the horizon, the great unknown
My heart has an ache it's as heavy as stone
Will the dawn coming on make it light?
I cover the waterfront;
I'm watching the sea
Will the one I love be coming back to me?
I cover the waterfront;
In search of my love
And I'm covered by a starlit sky above
Here am I patiently waiting, hoping and praying
Oh, how I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
I hope you remember
Will you return?
I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
For the one I love must soon come back to me
For the one I love must soon come back to me
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
I hope you remember
Will you return?
I cover the waterfront
I'm watching the sea
For the one I love must soon come back to meEmbed
