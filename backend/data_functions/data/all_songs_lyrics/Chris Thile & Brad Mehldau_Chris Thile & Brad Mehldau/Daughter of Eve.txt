Daughter of Eve Lyrics
Gardener says I might well be the most beautiful daughter of Eve And that Eden could be ours again
If the cherubim named me the most beautiful daughter of Eve
With the kiss upon my cheek they'll welcome us in

The cherubim my dear made me the most beautiful daughter of Eve
But they will more than kiss my cheek before Eden is open again
But God was lying through his teeth
And now you're who will be who is offering
And see the cherubim will bring to the most beautiful daughter of EveEmbed
