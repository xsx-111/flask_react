Big Change in the Weather LyricsI know you from way back when we used to be together
I knew you before your hair was long
Now it seems that now we're out, there's been a big change in the weather
Had to sit down and write this song
I had to sit down and write this song, mmmm
Now when I read what you said it came as no surprise
I knew you'd spit it out someday
Yes I knew that you'd do it and you know that you blew it
Right then you gave it all away
Ah, right then you gave it all away, mmmm
Seems so long ago but I know you must remember
How you used to bare your soul to me
All your dreams, all your fears, all your hopes and all your tears
Just might have slipped your memory
Just might have slipped your memory, mmmm
Well, now you're a hero, they line up to feed your ego
They just love everything you do
But I'm still in no hurry and I sure don't have to worry
When I look at what that's done to you
Yeah, when I look at what that's done to you, mmmm
If your head is in a mess why don't you give yourself a rest
Before you finally reach the end?
When your bubble is bust and you don't know who to trust
I hope you recognise your friends
I just hope you recognise your friends, mmmm
We've all got to grow up, we've all got to own up
We're all going to die someday
Yes, we're all in the same boat, wearing the same coat
Everybody's going one way
I said everybody's going one wayEmbed
