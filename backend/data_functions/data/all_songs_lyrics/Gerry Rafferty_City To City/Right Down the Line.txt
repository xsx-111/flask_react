Right Down the Line Lyrics
You know I need your love
You've got that hold over me
Long as I've got your love
You know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, woman
Right down the line

I know how much I lean on you
Only you can see
The changes that I've been through
Have left a mark on me
You've been as constant as a Northern Star
The brightest light that shines
It's been you, woman
Right down the line

I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
That every day I'm loving you so much more
Cause you believed in me
Through my darkest night
Put something better inside of me
You brought me into the light
Threw away all those crazy dreams
I put them all behind
And it was you, woman
Right down the line


I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way of telling you
That every day I'm loving you so much more

If I should doubt myself
If I'm losing ground
I won't turn to someone else
They'd only let me down
When I wanted you to share my life
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, woman
Right down the line11Embed
