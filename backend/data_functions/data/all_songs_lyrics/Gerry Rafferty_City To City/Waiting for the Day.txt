Waiting for the Day LyricsWell here I am, back in town
Just as the night is comin' down
Warm wind blowin' through the trees
I watch them swing, I watch them sway
Lie here waiting for the day
Sleep won't come, I need a drink
Stop my head, don't wanna think
Wishing I could be with you
But I know you're so far away
And I'm here waiting for the day
Water of life pour your light down on me
Take me out of this darkness, sweet star of the sea
Water so sweet you can open my eyes
You can bring down the rain on this desert so dry
Out on the street, shadows fall
Silence speaks, I hear it call
City of the living dead
Count the lights on the motorway
Lie here waiting for the day (alright)
Water of life pour your light down on me
Take me out of this darkness, sweet star of the sea
Water so sweet you can open my eyes
You can bring down the rain on this desert so dry
Yes here I am, back in town
Just as the night is comin' down
Warm wind blowin' through the trees
I watch them swing, I watch them sway
Lie here waiting for the day (alright)Embed
