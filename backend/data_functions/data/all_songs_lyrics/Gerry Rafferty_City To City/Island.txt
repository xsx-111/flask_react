Island LyricsWake up my love, the sun is shinin' out there, blue sky up above
It's a brand new day, let's walk outside and let that breeze blow all our cares away
You know that way back there in that city life
We've been strangers for so long
Now that I feel like I know you again
I want to stay
So long ago (yeah), we had a love so warm and bright when we had just begun
That was my last dream, since then I've watched the rest crumble one by one
Since we've been runnin' silent yeah it's felt so right
It's gettin' closer now everyday
Now that I feel like I know you again
I want to stay
(sha la la sha la la)
You know that on my own I don't make it alone
I need someone who needs me
I only know that wherever you are
I want to be
But from now on, we won't worry about a thing, yeah the past is gone
This is our last day (yeah), we're gonna make sweet love before we sail away
Sha la la sha la laEmbed
