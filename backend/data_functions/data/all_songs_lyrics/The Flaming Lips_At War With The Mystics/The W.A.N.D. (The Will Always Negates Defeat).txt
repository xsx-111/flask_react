The W.A.N.D. (The Will Always Negates Defeat) Lyrics
(You've got the power in there)
(Waving your wand in the air)

Time after time those fanatical minds try to rule all the world
Telling us all it's them who's in charge of it all
I've got a tricked out magic stick that will make them all fall
We've got the power now, motherfuckers; that's where it belongs

You've got that right
(Power in there)
You know that it is
(Waving your wand in the air)

They've got their weapons to solve all their questions, they don't know what it's for
(Because they don't know what it's for)
Why can't they see it's not power, that's greed, to just want more and more?
(Just want more and more)
I got a weapon it's here in my hand, a baton made of light
We're the enforcers, the sorcerer's orphans, and we know why we fight
(And we know why we fight)

You've got that right
(You've got the power in there)
(Waving your wand in the air)
(You've got the power in there)
(You've got the power in there)
(You've got the power in there)
(Waving your wand in the air)

You've got that right
You know that it isEmbed
