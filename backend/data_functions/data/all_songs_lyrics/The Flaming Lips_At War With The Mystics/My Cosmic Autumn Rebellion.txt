My Cosmic Autumn Rebellion Lyrics
They tell us
"Autumn's a coming and soon everything around us will die
Only a fool believes that he is different from the birds in the sky
All those birds go chasing some better sunny days
You can't hear them singing because they've all gone away"

But this one bird didn't leave you
It stayed through the wintertime
You can't hear it sing but you can hear it as it flies
So don't you believe them
They'll destroy you with their lies
They only see the obvious
They see the sun go down but they don't see it rise

This one bird didn't leave you
You can hear it as it flies
It's not very loud but you can hear it if you try
So don't you believe them?
Yes it's true someday everything dies
We won't let that defeat us
We can't hear them singing
But we can hear it as it flies
