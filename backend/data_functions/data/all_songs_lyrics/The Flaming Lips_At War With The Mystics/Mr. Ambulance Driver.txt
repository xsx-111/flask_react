Mr. Ambulance Driver Lyrics
(Sirens, indecipherable radio chatter)

Waiting for the ambulance to come
Hoping that it doesn't come too late
Hearing the sirens in the distance
Hold on, help is on the way

Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm right here beside her
And though I live, somehow I've found
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Wishing that I was the one that wasn't gonna be here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore

Oh, we can't trade places
Our lives are strangely our own
Mr. Ambulance Driver, tell me
For everyone that dies, someone new is born

Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm right here beside her
And though I live, somehow I've found
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Wishing that I was the one that wasn't gonna be here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
(More sirens, indecipherable radio chatter)

Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm right here beside her
And though I live, somehow I've found
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Wishing that I was the one that wasn't gonna be here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
