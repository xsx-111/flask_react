Time Will Tell LyricsTurning in the grain again
The bells begin to chime
Time, she says
"there's no turning back
Keep your eyes on the tracks"
Through the fields, somewhere there's blue
Oh, time will tell, she'll see us through
Howling out
The windy hills
And all the time we took
You should know just how it steals
Keep your hand on the wheel
And through it all, somewhere we knew
Time will tell, she'll see us through
And all fire and flames took all we trust
We're kicking up dust
Stations fade just like they do
Oh, time will tell, we always knew
Oh, time will tell, we always knew3Embed
