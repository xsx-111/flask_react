Astronaut LyricsI work mornings in the old yard
Digging in the ground
But I moonlight as an astronaut
Mostly just sit around and howl
Won't you come to my house tonight?
We could sleep on the floor
I got this window that looks out to Orion
I paid extra for
Aw, forget about the sun
He's forgotten us by now
Kiss me so I remember how
We'll turn these sorrows into strangers
Buy 'em a ticket on the train
Drop 'em off at the station
Watch 'em ride far away
Far away2Embed
