Living Proof LyricsThe night fell with bicycle bells, the dark had wooden teeth
Oh we broke on up to hill country, the air was thin and sweet
Lord, the air was thin and sweet
She held onto my coat that night, like a kid lost in her sleeves
Oh we warmed the ground, we hushed our sound
We slept on walking feet
Lord, we slept on walking feet
Oh darlin', pardon me
Can you help me remember
When we were all flying free
We were dust from our bodies
And we were flicker and flame, yeah we burned till the morning
Darlin', pardon me
Off in the night, you can hear 'em bright
The Sirens of the Sea
Oh and city birds and alley girls, they all just sing for free
Oh they all just sing for free
Oh darlin', pardon me
But do I look familiar
When we were just larkspur and leaves
We were strung through the tether
And we were all silver and stone
We were the lust of the miners
Darlin', pardon me
That sky glowed all calico like phosphor in the sea
To the ground we fall, she owns us all
Kings and boys and beast
Kings and boys and beast
Oh darlin', pardon me
But do I look familiar
When we were just flying free
And we burned from a freight train
And we were some flicker of truth in the smile of a salesman
And we were all buried jewels 'neath the grass in the suburbs
And we were all living proof
Oh darlin', pardon meEmbed
