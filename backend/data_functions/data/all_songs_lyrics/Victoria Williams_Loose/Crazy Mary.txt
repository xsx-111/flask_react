Crazy Mary LyricsShe lived on the curve of the road
In an old tar-paper shack
On the south side of town
On the wrong side of the tracks
Sometimes on the way into town
We'd say 'Mama, can we stop and give her a ride?'
Sometimes we did, but she shook her head and her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed, crazy Mary
Down a long dirt road
Past the parson's place
An old blue car
We used to race
Little country store with a sign tacked to the side
Said ' No L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G allowed'
Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
One night thunder cracked mercy backed outside my windowsill
Dreamed I was flying high above the trees, over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Bare bulb hung there, newspaper-covered walls
And Mary rising up above it all
Next morning on the way into town
We saw some skid marks, and followed them around
Over the curve, through the fields
Into the house of Mary
That which you fear the most, could meet you halfway
That which you fear the most, could meet you halfway
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
Drink it down, pass it around
Round, round, round, round
Where it stops nobody knows
Nobody knowsEmbed
