Love LyricsYou wanna know all about
Where you can get some
You need to know fast
There is no doubt you wanna know
Where you'll find some love
'Cause everybody wants it
Everybody needs it
Nobody gets the meaning of it
Not without love
Love is a giving thing
Love is a forgiving thing
Like spring... love
And you know you can trust in love
A man once said to me
A long time ago
He lost his true love
How can that be
Maybe later he'll see that
All that lives on is love
And everybody wants it
Everybody needs it
Nobody seems to get it
All confused about it
But to get it
You have to just give it
You have to just live it
Once in a while
You open up just like a child
And see things fresh and new
I wish this for you
I wish this for you
Love
Everybody wants it
Everybody needs it
Everyone deserves it
Even if you're bad
Even if you're sad
Even if you're mad or blue...Embed
