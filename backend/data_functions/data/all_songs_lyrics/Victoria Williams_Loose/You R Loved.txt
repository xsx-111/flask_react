You R Loved LyricsMan takes his cane to a waterfall
Has a vision
Starts talking baby talk
Understood by a girl in Peru
We read about it in the daily news
Lines of poetry
Revealing mysteries
Still some can't swim
Jesus walked on the water
He turned the water into wine
He went down to the drunkards
To tell them everything is fine
You R loved
You R loved
You R really loved
I cannot decide
Who should die or live
I do my best to forgive
Falling backwards in the eventide
Listening at the riversideEmbed
