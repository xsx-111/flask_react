Polish Those Shoes LyricsPotato 2, potato 3, potato 4
5 potato, 6 potato, 7 potato, more
Better run and hide if they're searching for you
Can you get home without them catching you?
In your own private hiding place
You can stand on your head
You can bake a mud pie instead
You can crawl through the brush
Or you can tell the dog to hush
You can  be careful
You can make up your mind
Or you can lose complete sense of time
You can, somebody's ringing a bell
It's hard to tell what it sounds like
Oh, dinner bell or a wedding bell
The game must be over, it is going
It didn't catch you and you're home free
Saturday night and the neighbors are having a ball
You can hear Daddy's voice rise above them all
He's got his belt in his hand and he's walking down the hall
Us kids are fighting, us kids are fighting
Sunday morning, getting ready for church
We thought we looked fine, oh but it just wouldn't do
You better polish those shoes, you better polish those shoes
No one should see the dirt you've been through
Get in there and polish those shoes
Jesus down on bended knee
With cloth in hand washed His disciples? feet
Us kids are fighting, us kids are fighting
Fighting to be one, fighting to be theirs
Fighting just to cover up the 
 but be careful
You can lay down on your knees
You can ask whatever you please
You can make up your mind
Or you can lose complete sense of time
(You can)
In your own private hiding place
(You can, you can)
In your own private hiding place
(You can)
Yeah, you can, you can, you can, you can
You can, you can, you can, you can
Yeah, you can, you can
One day, two day, three day, four
One day, two day, three day, four
One day, two day, three day, four
Laughing, smiling, running, waitingEmbed
