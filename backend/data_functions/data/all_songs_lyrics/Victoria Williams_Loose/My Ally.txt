My Ally LyricsNo we don’t make passionate love
No we don’t even kiss and hug
Not a lot of jealousy
I’m friends with you
I hope you’re friends with me
You’re my ally
Worn out grudges just don’t exist
Spin around till we’re tired of this
We don’t care who owes who
You don’t own me I don’t own you
You’re my ally
Standing on the pavement
Looking like an accident
Waiting on the weekend
Catch you in the wind
You’re my allyEmbed
