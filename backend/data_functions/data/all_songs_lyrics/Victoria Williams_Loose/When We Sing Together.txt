When We Sing Together LyricsWhen we sing together
Sing a song that's new
Sing a song that's new
So the children
Will remember
See me smile
Is this you
Singing with me
When we laugh together
Laugh about old quarrels
Laugh about old quarrels
Till they're smoothed out
Like the water
Birds on high
Sweetly sing
Songs of hope
La de da da
La de da de da
La de da de da de da
La de da da
Through the sorrow and circumstance
Fine jewels and unpaid rent
A day in the sun, a year in the dark
Holding to the fire we had
And there was nothing but a spark
Spun our wheels
Paid our deals
Nearly we broke our hearts
When we pray together
Share a perfect love
Share a perfect love
For the beauty
God has given
Angels know
Later on
We'll see it allEmbed
