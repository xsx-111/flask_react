Breakfast Time LyricsBreakfast time, breakfast time
The hands that tell me
Five to nine
Orange lights in orange lines
Sparkle bright of souls entwine
Pouting girl, sitting pretty
On the bus
Reminiscing, clammy kissing
Summer breeze, the big strip tease
You and I could frollic in the dew
Only I've something better to do
And with that I bid you fond farewell
Oh, how I wish I was young again
Oh, how I wish I was young again
Young again, young again1Embed
