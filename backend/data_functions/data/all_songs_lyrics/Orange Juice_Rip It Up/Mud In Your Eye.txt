Mud In Your Eye LyricsHere's some mud in your pretty eye
But please drop in if you're passing by
I'll tell you how much I hate you, girl
Perhaps that isn't true
Though it's not the way it seems
And you can shatter my illusions
But you'll never haunt my dreams again
Ever again
And to those who are snide
And those who connive
I say love cannot be contrived
Love cannot be denied
I've always tried to be true to myself
And if you ask me to explain
The rules of the game
I'll say you've missed the point again
And againEmbed
