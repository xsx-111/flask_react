Turn Away LyricsI don't know quite what to do
When you turn away
I don't know quite what to say
It doesn't matter if I say
I'll never tell you lies
I always hate to see you cry
You can never understand
And you won't let me touch your hand
And if you punch me in the eye
It's always you that starts to cry
I don't know quite what to do
Laugh but I'm lost without you
I wish that I could wash away
All those things I say
I'd like to get inside your head
And when I'm trying to talk some sense
I wonder if it's me
Or someone that I'd like to be
You can never understand
And you won't let me touch your hand
And if you punch me in the eye
It's always you that starts to cry
I don't know quite what to do
Laugh but I'm lost without you
You can never understand
And you won't let me touch your hand
And if you punch me in the eye
It's always you that starts to cry
I don't know quite what to do
Laugh but I'm lost without you
I always hate to see you cry
And I don't know quite what to say
But I'll be waiting at the end
For you, my special, special friendEmbed
