Louise Louise LyricsThat's a trifle obvious, girl
Telling me you don't belong in this world
Telling me as I fall flat on my face
In any case, that's your fall from grace
I know these melodramatics don't make things all right
Nor will they make you see things in a different light
You're a very pretty girl, Louise
But are the things you say just meant to tease
I'm doubled up on bended knees
Tell me, precious, tell me please
I know these melodramatics don't make things all right
Nor will they make you see things in a in a different light
And you can bite your lip
Till the blood ran red
They're still such crazy things
To have said
Have a wonderful birthday, dear
Such a wonderful birthday, dear
It only comes but once a year
I'll spoil your party with a punky sneer
I know these melodramatics don't make things alright
Nor will they make you see things in a different lightEmbed
