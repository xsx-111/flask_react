Flesh Of My Flesh LyricsHere's a penny for your thoughts
Incidentally you may keep the change
And here's a book of etiquette
I bought to keep you sane
And mutual friends say make amends
And a stitch in time saves nine or ten
Goodbyes
Flesh of my flesh
Flesh of my flesh
Flesh of my flesh
The difference between you and me
Is that the world owes you a living
And you always tow the party line
In your loving and your giving
Our mutual friends say make amends
And a stitch in time saves nine or ten
Goodbyes
Flesh of my flesh
Flesh of my flesh
Flesh of my fleshEmbed
