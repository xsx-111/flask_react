You Wanna Freak Out LyricsPlay it safe, play it cool
If you ever emote, you're playing the fool
Is that the way you think it is?
You can't get yours if he ain't getting his, come on
You know how you are
First you're up, up, down, down
One day you're in, the next one you're out
You wanna freak out? Come on
You wanna freak out? Come on
Ay, come on
Ay, come on
Play it smart, soul intact
How you react is what you get back
'Cause that's the way we really see
I am "you're" and "you're" is me
Come on, you know how we are
First we're up, up, down, down
One day we're in, the next one we're out
You wanna freak out? Come on
You wanna freak out? Come on
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
You wanna freak out? Come on
You wanna freak out? Come on
You wanna freak out?
You wanna freak out?
You wanna freak out?
You wanna freak out?
You wanna freak out? Come on
Yeah, oh3Embed
