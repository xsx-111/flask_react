First Light LyricsFirst light tonight
First light tomorrow
First light this morning
First light this evening
First light tonight
Been looking back
Down through the ages
First I was an ancient
Then I was an infant
Now I am alive
Been holding out
Searching for something
Something to carry
Me over the sunset
To dawn's early light
First light tonight
First light tomorrow
First light this evening
First light this morning
First light tonight, yeah
Then I found it
Or did it find me, oh?
My search it was over
My blood filled with gold
My own inner light
I been prayin'
Still holding on
First light tonight
First light tomorrow
First light this morning
First light this evening
First light tonight
First light tonight
First light tomorrow
Yeah, first light this evening
First light this morning
First light tonight1Embed
