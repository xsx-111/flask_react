Circuital LyricsSpinning out gracefully
Going nowhere quickly
I am older day by day
Still going back to my childhood way
Circuital
Round and round patiently
Getting lost by the guide
And I'm all worked up over nothing
Circuits
All running out
Connect my body
Deep into the ground
Circuits
Connect the Earth to the moon
And link our heavenly bodies
Not a moment too soon
Well you can fling open the windows
Or you can board 'em up
Satan's jeweled crown
Or Christ’s humble cup
You think you'll find yourself out there
Out in the lion’s den
In some bloody battle
Over belief systems
Or disappear into the vacuum
Total neutrality
Where you can't lose nothing
But nothing can be gained
Well anyway you cut it
We're just spinning around
Out on the circuit
Over the hallowed ground
Out on the circuit
Over the hallowed ground
Ending up in the same place
That we started out
Right back in the same place
Right back in the same place
That we started out1Embed
