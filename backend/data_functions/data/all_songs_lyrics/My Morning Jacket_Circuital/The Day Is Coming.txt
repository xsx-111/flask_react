The Day Is Coming Lyrics
You need it, that's for sure
You receive, but always want more
Taken for granted
This lifetime and what's up ahead

But the day is coming
The day is near
The day is coming
You know what I mean
The day is coming
The way is clear
The day has come

Bang bang on the door
You opened not knowing what for
If opportunity rears its head
Will you answer or stay home in bed?
Hey babe

'Cause the day is coming
The day is near
The day is coming
You know what I mean
The day is coming
The way is clear
The day has come, oh
Hey babe
But the day is coming
The day is near
The day is coming
You know what I mean
The day is coming
The way is clear
The day has comeEmbed
