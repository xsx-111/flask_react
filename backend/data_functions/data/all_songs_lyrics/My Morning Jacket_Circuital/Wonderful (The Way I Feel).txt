Wonderful (The Way I Feel) Lyrics
It matters to me
Took a long time to get here
If it would’ve been easy
I would not have cared
Like a tropical forest
Like a cop on the beat
When all is in order
You get lost in the heat

I feel so wonderful, wonderful
Wonderful the way I feel
I feel so wonderful, wonderful
Ooh, wonderful the way I feel

Doesn’t matter to me
I can take or leave it
I can learn from way back when
And still live right now
With the sun on my shoulder
And the wind at my back
I will never grow older
At least not in my mind
I feel so wonderful, wonderful
Wonderful the way I feel
I feel so wonderful, wonderful
Wonderful the way I feel (so wonderful)
Wonderful, wonderful
Wonderful the way I feel
I feel so wonderful, wonderful
Ooh, wonderful the way I feel

I'm going where there ain’t no fear
I'm going where the spirit is near
I'm going where the living is easy
And the people are kind
A new state of mind
I'm going where there ain't no police
I'm going there ain't no disease
I'm going where there ain't no need
To escape from what is
Only spirits at ease
