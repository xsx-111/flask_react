Victory Dance Lyrics
Should I close my eyes and prophesize
Hoping maybe someday come?
Should I wet the ground with my own tears
Crying over what's been done?
Should I lift the dirt and plant the seed
Even though I've never grown?
Should I wet the ground with the sweat from my brow
And believe in my good work?
My good work
My good work
My good work

Hey there, I'm flying up above
Looking down on the tired earth
I can see, I can see potential
Speaking through you, speaking to you
From all of heaven's possibility
Power, hey, do you know how it work?
Hey, do you know that the meek
They shall inherit the earth?
You should work, you should work
Yeah, for the self and the family

Should I hit the water or stay on dry land
Even though I've never swam?
Take machete into the brush
Though at first there is no path
Taste the war paint on my tongue
As it's dripping with my sweat
Place my gaze in the future's path
Seeing things that ain't come yet
Hope to watch the victory dance
After the day's work is done
Hope to watch the victory dance
In the evening's setting sun
Hope to watch the victory dance
Over many lives to come
Hope to watch the victory dance
In the evening's setting sun

Setting sun
Setting sun
Setting sun

Hope to dance the victory dance
After the day's work is done (setting sun)
Hope to dance the victory dance
In the evening's setting sun (setting sun)
Hope to dance the victory dance
Over many lives to come (setting sun)
Hope to dance the victory dance
In the evening's setting sun, setting sun
