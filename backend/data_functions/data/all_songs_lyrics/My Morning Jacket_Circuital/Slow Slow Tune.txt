Slow Slow Tune LyricsSlow, not the meter of today
But I'm not singing for night anyway
This slow, slow tune
You, somewhere in the future listening
I hope the present for you is glistening
With notes that ring so true
This slow, slow tune
Slow, slow tune
Slow, Daddy's playing just for you
The tempo's right, I'm in a mellow mood
Oh, this slow, slow tune
Gotta radiate the gold
Gotta radiate the gold
Gotta radiate the gold, ooh
True, Daddy is singing just for you
But do you hear him, baby, anymore?
Now that you've outgrown
This slow, slow tune
Grown with a meter all your own
You decide the pace, you set the tone
Your future now you own
This slow, slow tune
Slow, slow tune1Embed
