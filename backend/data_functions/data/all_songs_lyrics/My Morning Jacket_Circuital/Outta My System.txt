Outta My System LyricsThey told me not to smoke drugs, but I wouldn't listen
Never thought I'd get caught and wind up in prison
Chalk it up to youth but young age I ain't dissin'
I guess I just had to get it outta my system
Outta my system
Outta my system
Oh Lord, I'd never do it now
I know what I ain't missin'
Glad I went and got it all outta my system
The lust of youth versus married security
I'm glad I'm here now, but just between you and me
I had to get it out and make the deals
And learn to know how it feels, but that it ain't real
Outta my system
Now oh, outta my system
There's a way to have it all
You know I ain't kiddin'
Some things I know I'll never get outta my system
If you don't live now, you ain't even tryin'
And then you're on your way to a midlife crisis
Live it out any way you feel
You can feel it in your bones, but try to deny it
Wipe it off your face but your eyes won't hide it
You knew it all along, but never made it clear
They told me not to steal cars, said I'd wind up in prison
Thought I knew it all, yeah I wouldn't listen
Chalk it up to young age, but youth I ain't dissin'
I guess I just had to get it outta my system
Outta my system
Now oh, outta my system
I'm glad I did it all then
I know what I ain't missin'
Glad I went and got it all outta my system
I'm glad I did it all, now I know what I ain't missin'
Glad I went and got it all outta my system, oh
I'm glad I did it all, now I know what I ain't missin'
Glad I went and got it all outta my system, oh, oh, ohEmbed
