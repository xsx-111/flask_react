Holdin on to Black Metal Lyrics
It's a darkness you can't deny
But it don't belong in a grown-up mind
Distortion finds its place in a youngster's eyes
Coming into life, you need its grind
But at a certain point, you gotta let it go
Or it will cross the permanent threshold
You know you gotta find it in something else good
Oh black metal, you're so misunderstood

Holdin' on to black metal (black metal)
Holdin' on to black metal (black metal)
Black metal, you've been holdin' on too long

Oh black metal, so misunderstood
Keep black service under Lucifer's hood
Black metal steals souls young, enough is enough
Friends want refills out of Lucifer's cup
Black metal needs to be unlearned, you teenage pup
Look at you, starchild, you're all grown up

Still holdin' on to black metal (black metal)
Still holdin' on to black metal (black metal)
Black metal, you've been holdin' on too long
Catchin' waves on Lucifer's beach
Taking shade underneath Lucifer's trees
Getting sustenance from Lucifer's peach
Oh black metal, it's affecting all your speech

Holdin' on to black metal (black metal)
Holdin' on to black metal (black metal)
Black metal, you've been holdin' on too long

(Black metal)
(Black metal)
Oh, bring them to me (black metal)
Oh, making me think (black metal)
Oh one, two, three
