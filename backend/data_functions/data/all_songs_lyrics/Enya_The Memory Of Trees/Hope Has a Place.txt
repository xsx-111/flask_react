Hope Has a Place Lyrics
One look at love and you may see
It weaves a web over mystery
All raveled threads can rend apart
For hope has a place in the lover's heart
Hope has a place in a lover's heart

Whispering world, a sigh of sighs
The ebb and the flow of the ocean tides
One breath, one word may end or may start
A hope in a place of the lover's heart
Hope has a place in a lover's heart

Look to love, you may dream
And if it should leave then give it wings
But if such a love is meant to be
Hope is home and the heart is free

Under the heavens we journey far
On roads of life we're the wanderers
So let love rise, so let love depart
Let hope have a place in the lover's heart
Hope has a place in a lover's heart
Look to love and you may dream
And if it should leave then give it wings
But if such a love is meant to be
Hope is home and the heart is free

Hope is home, and the heart is freeEmbed
