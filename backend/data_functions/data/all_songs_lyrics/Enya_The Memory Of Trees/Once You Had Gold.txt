Once You Had Gold Lyrics
Once you had gold
Once you had silver
Then came the rains
Out of the blue

Ever and always
Always and ever
Time gave both darkness and dreams to you

Now you can see
Spring becomes autumn
Leaves become gold
Falling from view

Ever and always
Always and ever
No-one can promise a dream come true
Time gave both darkness and dreams to you


What is the dark
Shadows around you
Why not take heart
In the new day?
Ever and always
Always and ever
No-one can promise a dream come true
Time gave both darkness and dreams to youEmbed
