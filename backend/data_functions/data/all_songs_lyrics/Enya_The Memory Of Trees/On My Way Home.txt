On My Way Home Lyrics
I have been given
One moment from heaven
As I am walking
Surrounded by night
Stars high above me
Make a wish under moonlight

On my way home
I remember
All the good days
On my way home
I remember
All the best days
I'm on my way home
I can remember
Every new day

I move in silence
With each step taken
Snow falling round me
Like angels in flight
Far in the distance
Is my wish under moonlight
On my way home
I remember
All the good days
On my way home
I remember
All the best days
I'm on my way home
I can remember
Every new day


On my way home
I remember
All the good days
On my way home
I remember
All the best days
I'm on my way home
I can remember
Every new day

On my way home
I remember
All the good days
On my way home
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu
I remember
All the best days
I'm on my way home
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu
I can remember
Every new day
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu

On my way home
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu
I remember
All the good days
On my way home
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu
I remember
All the good days
On my way home
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu
I remember
All the good daysEmbed
