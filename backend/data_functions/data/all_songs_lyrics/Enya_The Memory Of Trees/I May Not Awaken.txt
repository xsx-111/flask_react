I May Not Awaken Lyrics
When the warmth of the day becomes the night
Who could sleep beneath a strange moonlight?
No guiding star
So far from home

Walked the way of promise to find but snow
Throughout, the voice of the winds brings nothing more
Than low echoes
So far from home

Even from a child, a wish is not enough
For me, for me the sky may fall
And even from a child, a dream is not enough
Could be, could be the sky may fall
Could be, could be the night ends all

No rains could weep as I have wept
To know a simple dream will not be kept
I am a child
So far from home

One by one the sky falls
I may not awaken1Embed
