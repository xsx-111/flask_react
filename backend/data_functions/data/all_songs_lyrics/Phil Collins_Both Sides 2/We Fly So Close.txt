We Fly So Close Lyrics
My harbour lights are fading fast
Soon they'll disappear
Alone I sit in darkness
Hoping someone might come near
Though I  wait, though I  try
No one ever comes
And the feeling that I  have flood over me
The river starts to run

We fly so close 
Sometimes we fly too close

Every place you run to, everywhere you turn
There are places that you know you should not go
But some bridges just won't burn
All my life, though i try
I cannot change the past
And the ghosts that come back to haunt you
Make you realize at last


My heart is racing much faster now
Life passes before my eyes
Something I  see, they make me smile
Something they make me cry
So I look, so I try to find
A lesson I can learn
The passing of time hasn't changed my mind
And the ghosts I know return

We fly so close, you and I sometimes
Sometimes we fly so close
We'll never know how many times
We fly so close
We fly so closeEmbed
