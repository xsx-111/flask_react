Miami Lyrics
I promised you on an ocean of
Mother-of-pearl, gold and indigo
Cut through the waves, I watched you swim away
I've never loved you more than today

Would you be there
Be there, be there for me? (In Miami)
Would you be there
Be there, be there for me? (In Miami)

Now black light sets on my short day
Oh, you betrayed me, you gave it away
You don't mind picking up salt
To rub into my wounds

Would you be there
Be there, be there for me? (In Miami)
Would you betray me
Or save me, save me from you? (In Miami)

Miami bad, Miami bad, Miami bad, Miami bad
Miami bad, Miami bad, Miami bad, Miami bad
Miami bad, Miami bad, Miami bad, Miami bad
Miami bad, Miami bad, Miami bad, Miami bad
Would you be there
Be there, be there for me? (In Miami)
Would you betray me
Or save me, save me from you? (In Miami)
Would you be there
Be there, be there for me? (In Miami)
Would you betray me
Save me, save me? (In Miami)3Embed
