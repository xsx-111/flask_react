Alabaster Lyrics
She's up in the sky, she's up in the domes
She's up in the sky, up in the dome
I knew a girl who came from Villa Luz, had a house filled with
Religious regret and infinite debt, heaven's pressure
She's a light in the dark, she's out the door
She's up in the sky, up in the domes

Alabaster lover, you won't get more
We make each other, you won't get more
Alabaster lover, you won't get more
We make each other, you won't get more

She's up in the sky and the sky is on fire
She set the whole neighbourhood to life
Then the people, they'll read out all their names
Run away, run away, run away
And with victory, the whole world would be ours
We will fear nothing in it, nothing in it

Alabaster lover, you won't get more
We could make each other, you won't get more
Alabaster lover, you won't get more
We made each other, you won't get more
Alabaster lover, we made each other4Embed
