After Glow Lyrics
I know I could not last for very long at all
Without you here to break my fall
I know I could not stand alone for very long
Without you there to take my call
'Cause you were better than whatever came before
Before you ran out and left me on the 100th floor

Get up and go and find everyone you care for
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get up and go and forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow

No, I could not do the things I did before
Leave you waiting there by that open door
You were better than whatever came before
Without you here, in my heart, I'm broken to the core

Get up and go and find everyone you care for
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get up and go and forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow
No, I could not stand to be alone for long
There's something missing in the ever after glow
You were better than whatever came before
Without you here to save me, to save me from the dogs


Get up and go and find everyone you care for
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get up and go and forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow2Embed
