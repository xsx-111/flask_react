This Orient Lyrics
And now it's just gone after dark
And we move to the other part of it
Secret part of your restless heart
To glide past every city light
Like a satellite careering through the sky
This colour, this summer night

It's your path, it's your heart
That gives me this Western feeling
It's your path, it's your heart
That gives me this Western feeling
Mmm, do you know, you give me
You give me this Western feeling?

Now look back, see how far you've come
Will you unravel in the sun?
Become undone? Or find your place?
Held up high, safe from stranger swell
No return to that restless place
You've reached it, you've found your grace

It's your path, it's your heart
That gives me this Western feeling
It's your path, it's your heart
That gives me this Western feeling
Oh, do you know, you give me
You give me this Western feeling?
It's your path, it's your heart
That gives you this Western feeling
It's your heart that gives you
That gives you this Western feeling

It's your heart that gives you
That gives you this Western feeling
It's your path, it's your heart
That gives you this Western feeling
Oh, how do you know, what gives me
What gives me this Western feeling?
Oh, how do you know, what gives me
What gives me this Western feeling?11Embed
