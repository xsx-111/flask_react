Total Life Forever Lyrics
I know a place where I can go when I'm low down
To your house, down to your house I will go when I'm low
I know a face who I can show my true colours
To your arms, into your arms I will go when I'm low

'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, y'know?
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, y'know?

I've seen it all, the skyline and the lone call
To your house, down to your house I will go when I'm low
They took it all with a view to the great fall
To your arms, into your arms I will go when I'm low

'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, y'know?
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, y'know?

Singularity is here to stay
So Rhode Island, Rhode Island, Rhode Island
Rhode Island, Rhode Island, Island, go
Let's take it slow
Singularity is here to stay, for you and me
Rhode Island, Rhode Island, Rhode Island
Rhode Island, Rhode Island, Island, go
Let's take life slow
Rhode Island, Rhode Island, Rhode Island
Rhode Island, Rhode Island, Island, go
Let's take life slow
Rhode Island, Rhode Island, Rhode Island
Rhode Island, Rhode Island, Island, go
Let's take life slow
I know a place where I can go when I'm low down
To your house, down to your house I will go when I'm low
I know a face who I can show my true colours
To your arms, into your arms I will go when I'm low

'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, y'know?
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough, y'know?2Embed
