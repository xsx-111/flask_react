Blue Blood Lyrics
You got blue blood on your hands
I think it's my own
We can go down to the streets
And follow the shoals
Of all the people
We could be two
But I bite my nails to the quick
And run back home

You got blue blood on your hands
I know it's my own
You came at me in the midnight
To show me my soul
Of all the people
I hoped it'd be you
To come and free me, take me away
And show me my home
Where I was born
Where I belong

You got blue blood on your hands
I want you to know
I hoped you'd come and take me away
Back to my home
Of all the people
It had to be you
Then I bite my nails to the quick
And run back home
You show me where to go
To my home, to my home
So take me through the roads
That you know to my home

You got blue blood on your hands
I know it's my own
You came at me in the midnight
To show me my soul

You show me where to go
To my home, to my home
So take me through the roads
That you know to my home

Come and be accepted, affected, protected
(You show me)
Come and be accepted, so now you know
(Where to go, to my home)
Come and be accepted, affected, protected
(To my home, so take me)
Come and be accepted, so now you know
(Through the roads that you know to my home)
You show me where to go
To my home, to my home
So take me through the roads
That you know (You know, you know...)
That you know
To my home
So take me through the roads
That you know, where you know
You showed me where to go
To my home

Come and be accepted, affected, protected
Come and be accepted, so now you know
Come and be accepted, affected, protected
Come and be accepted, so now you know

You got blue blood on your hands
I know it's my own
We can go down to the streets
And follow the shoals
Of all the people
I hoped it'd be you
Show me my way back home
To where I was born
Where I belong
Where I belong4Embed
