God Bless Our Dead Marines LyricsThey put angels in the electric chair
The electric chair
The electric chair
Straight-up angels in the electric chair
The electric chair
The electric chair
They put angels in the electric chair
The electric chair
The electric chair
Straight-up angels in the electric chair
The electric chair
The electric chair
And no one knew or no one cared
But burning stars lit up their hair
And burning stars lit up their hair
And crawled to heaven on golden stairs
And oh, how we to and fro
To and fro, to and fro
Oh, how we to and fro
To and fro, to and fro
Oh, how we to and fro
(This is our torched estate)
To and fro, to and fro
(This is our torched estate)
Oh, how we to and fro
(This is our torched estate)
To and fro, to and fro
(This is our torched estate)
This is our torched estate
(This is our torched estate)
This is our torched estate
(This is our torched estate)
This is our torched estate
(This is our torched estate)
This is our torched estate
(This is our torched estate)
We are your sweet mistakes
And all them vulgar kings on their dirty thrones
Who among us will avenge Ms. Nina Simone?
And all them vulgar kings on their dirty thrones
Who among us will avenge Ms. Nina Simone?
There's fresh meat in the club tonight
God bless our dead marines
Someone had an accident
Above the burning trees
While somewhere distant peacefully
Our vulgar princes sleep
Dead kids don't get photographed
God bless our dead marines
The hungry and the hanged
The damaged and the done
Striving 'long this spinning rock
Tumbling past the sun
Get through this life without killing anyone
And consider yourself golden
Lost a friend to cocaine
Couple friends to smack
Troubled hearts map deserts
And they rarely do come back
Lost a friend to oceans
Lost a friend to hills
Lost a friend to suicide
Lost a friend to pills
Lost a friend to monsters
Lost a friend to shame
Lost a friend to marriage
Lost a friend to blame
Lost a friend to worry
And lost a friend to wealth
Lost a friend to stubborn pride
And then I lost myself
I love my dog and she loves me
The world's a mess and so are we
She tumbles 'long green, muddy fields
Sick with joy and glee
And then she dreams sweet puppy dreams
Whimpering gently
There's fresh meat in the club tonight
God bless our dead marines
Someone had an accident above the burning trees
While somewhere distant peacefully
Our vulgar princes sleep
Dead kids don't get photographed
God bless this century
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong
When the world is sick can't no one be well
But I dreamt we was all beautiful and strong6Embed
