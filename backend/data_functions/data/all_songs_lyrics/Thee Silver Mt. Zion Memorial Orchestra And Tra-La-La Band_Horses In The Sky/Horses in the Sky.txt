Horses in the Sky LyricsOh, my broken lamb
I worry when you cry
Baby's gonna fetch ya
Horses in the sky
Though dead hands ring the garden
And these are violent times
And violence brings more violence
And liars bring more lies
Though we were born defeated
Worried, tired, and scared
And monsters build mean robots
Launching rockets into the air
And the wealth of our nations
Fed on angel blood
And our cities shot with moneyed schemes
Built on twigs and mud
And our schools look like prisons
And our prisons look like malls
And downtown's just a sick parade
Where no one cares at all
And our heroes all died crazy
Broken, poor, or shot
Let's celebrate their tragedy
And sanctify the loss
And manifest the daydream
Like those who failed before
And glorify our small attempts
And hate ourselves no more
Blow words between this sucker's teeth
And bind these panicked hands
Lose your heart like a clumsy bell
Please be well
Please be well
Please be well
Please be well
Please be well
Please be well
Please be well
Please be well
And all I true love
Is the light
In my sister's darling eyes
And all I true love
Is the light
In my sister's darling eyes
And all I true love
Is the light
In my sister's darling eyes
And all I true love
Is the light
In my sister's darling eyes
And all I true love
Is the light
In my sister's darling eyesEmbed
