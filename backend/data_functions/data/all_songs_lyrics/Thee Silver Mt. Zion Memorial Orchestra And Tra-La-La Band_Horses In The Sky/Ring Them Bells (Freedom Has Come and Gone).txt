Ring Them Bells (Freedom Has Come and Gone) LyricsRing them bells
Ring them sorrowful bells
Now freedom has come and gone
We've been waiting so long
Never ever so long
Now freedom has come and gone
Shake that tail
Like any other worried soul
Now freedom has come and gone
Steam train's coming
Thirteen stories high
If that steam train don’t come
I swear I will lay down and die
The city makes canyons
All littered with snow
And beneath their crummy towers
Our tiny bodies blow and blow
So drown them bells
Drown them miserable bells
Freedom has come and gone
Freedom has come and gone
Freedom has come and gone
Freedom has come and gone
We was all of us just tumbling birds hanging in the sky
And hauled our bones 'long troubling roads and didn’t none of us know why
And as we staggered towards a frightening dawn
I swear all I ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever believed in
Was all of us together all along
We was all of us just shot birds tumbling through the sky
And built cheap homes along company roads and didn’t none of us ask why
And as we staggered towards a frightening dawn
I swear all I ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever believed in
Was all of us together all along
Imagine the view
From a helicopter gunship
And a man comes into view
You hit that switch and you cut that man in two
Imagine the view
And they bounce that shit off of satellites
And they hit that switch and when they hit that switch
All of heaven shits on you
Imagine the view
From the helicopter gunship
A man comes into view
And you hit that switch and you cut that man in two
Imagine the view
And they bounce that shit off of satellites
And they hit that switch and when they hit that switch
All of heaven falls on you
Imagine the viewEmbed
