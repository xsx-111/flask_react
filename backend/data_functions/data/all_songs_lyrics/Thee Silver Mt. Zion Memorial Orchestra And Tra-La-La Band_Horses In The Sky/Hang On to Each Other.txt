Hang On to Each Other LyricsWe all got born so afraid
And still search for words
To describe that pain
And cling to each other
Like pigeons in the rain
(Hang on to each other)
And nuzzle over feathered breast
(Hang on to each other)
With beaks all worn and cracked and stained
(Hang on to each other)
And Hang on to each other
Hang on to each other
Hang on to each other
Hang on to each other
So this one's for the lost ones
(Hang on to each other)
And the dead ones and the ones who fell away
(Hang on to each other)
All our busted brothers
(Hang on to each other)
And tumbled lovers
(Hang on to each other)
Spitting at the rain
(Hang on to each other)
We all got born so afraid
(Hang on to each other)
And still search for words
(Hang on to each other)
To describe that pain
(Hang on to each other)
And Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Any fucking thing you love
(Hang on to each other)
Any fucking thing you love
(Hang on to each other)
Any fucking thing you love
(Hang on to each other)
Any fucking thing you love
(Hang on to each other)
Any fucking thing you love
(Hang on to each other)
Any fucking thing you love
(Hang on to each other)
Any fucking thing you love
(Hang on to each other)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Birds toss precious flowers
(Hang on to each other)
(Any fucking thing you love)
From the murky skies above
(Hang on to each other)
(Any fucking thing you love)
Birds toss precious flowers
(Hang on to each other)
(Any fucking thing you love)
From the murky skies above
(Hang on to each other)
(Any fucking thing you love)
Birds toss precious flowers
(Hang on to each other)
(Any fucking thing you love)
From the murky skies above
(Hang on to each other)
(Any fucking thing you love)
Birds toss precious flowers
(Hang on to each other)
From the murky skies above
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)
Hang on to each other
(Any fucking thing you love)Embed
