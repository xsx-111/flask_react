Mountains Made of Steam LyricsThis was a stormy ending
Water sank our boats
Shouldn't we, oh, shouldn't we
Throw our hopes into the ocean
The ocean
The warm grey sea
Tell me or kick me or hold me or please believe
This is their busted future
And this is our dream
Which one do you believe in, believe in, believe in, believe in
Together, together, together, together
Never to retreat
Mystery and wonder
Messy hearts made of thunder
Somewhere there's a soldier
Sleeping in a field
Somewhere there's a mother, a mother, a mother
A mother, a mother, a mother
Please believe in gentle dreams
The sweetness of people
Whistling in their sleep
The angels in your palm
Sing gentle worried songs
The sweetness of our dreams
Like mountains made of steam
The angels in your palm
Sing gentle worried songs
And the sweetness of our dreams
Like mountains made of steam
The angels in your palm
Sing gentle worried songs
The sweetness of our dreams
Like mountains made of steamEmbed
