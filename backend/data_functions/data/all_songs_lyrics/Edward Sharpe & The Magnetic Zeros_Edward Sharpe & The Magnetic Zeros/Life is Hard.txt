Life is Hard Lyrics
Life is beauty through and through
Life is sunny, life is cool
Life is even easy too
But if my word is to be true
Life is something to behold
But if the truth is to be told
Let us not leave out any part
Do not fear, it's safe to say it here
You will not be called a weakling nor a fraud
For feeling the pain of the whole wide world
You wanna help but can't help the feeling you cannot
And it's killing you while you're just trying to smile from your heart
So go on, say it, on the same knees you're praying
Yes, life is hard

Come celebrate
Life is hard, aha ha ha
Come celebrate
Life is hard, aha ha ha
All life is all we are

Celebrate it in the sun
Promenade it with everyone
Elevate it in a song
And I'll be there to play it, don't get me wrong
When I feel like dying and being gone
When life is hard
There's just one thing, let's not forget
Yes! Life is it!
Life is it, life is it, it's where it's at
It's getting skinny, getting fat
It's falling deep into a love
It's getting crushed just like a bug
Life there's no love, it's getting beat into the ground
It's getting lost and getting found
To growing up and getting 'round
It's feeling silence, feeling sound
It's feeling lonely, feeling full
It's feeling oh so beautiful
Yes, hard

Come celebrate
Life is hard, aha aha
Come celebrate
Life is hard, aha aha
All life is all we are3Embed
