Please! LyricsJoy, joy is the giving
Give to everybody
Joy!
Joy!
War, war is the ego
Of man's repressed libido
Love!
Love!
Feel the love
Hear the love
See the love
Please!
Please!
Please!
Love, love is the mother
God, god is the human
You, the generator
Please!
Please!
Peace, peace is the giving
A piece for everybody
Please!
Please!
Feel you love
Hear you love
See you love
Love!1Embed
