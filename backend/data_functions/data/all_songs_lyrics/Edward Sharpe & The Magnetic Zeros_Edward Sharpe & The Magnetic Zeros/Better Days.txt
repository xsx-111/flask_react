Better Days LyricsI’ve seen better days, dripping down your face
We don’t have to talk, let’s dance
For all the times you felt alone, dreaming better
I see better, better days
Too dumb to say goodbye that's some cliché shit, make me wanna cry
Just know that every time I look in your eye, I see better, I see better, better days

Try to remember, that you can’t forget
Down with history, up with your head
For sweet tomorrow, she never fell from grace
We might still know sorrow but we got better days
I seen better ways, some won’t believe
But I don’t need much more than faith
For all the times you felt alone
Dreaming better, dreaming better, better ways
Too dumb to say goodbye, now that’s some give up shit, make me wanna cry
Just know that every time I look in your eye, I see better, I see better, better days

Better days
Guess who's back in town2Embed
