In the Summer LyricsIn the summer
Sister and your brother
Contemplating God
Out there on the sidewalk
Eating ice cream cones, ooh baby
More things to discover
Masturbating
To Miriam Makeba
And Iko Iko Inay
Ooh, the sun is shining good
Can't give us all your crap
You're not around
Makeup on and the curtains drawn
All the cereal bine, oh the summertime
With a plastic cup for the summer love
No, I don't want to go away
And the television girls all dance in the summer
In the summer
Singing la da da, da da da, hmm
La da da, da da da, hmm
La da da, da da da, hmm
Can't give us all your crap
You're not around
Makeup on and curtains drawn
All the cereal bine, oh the summertime
With a plastic cup for the summer love
No, I don't want to go away
And the chi-shi stoner girls
And the hard graffiti boys
And the television world all danced in the summerEmbed
