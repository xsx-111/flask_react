Two Lyrics
I am the prisoned man of single melody
Two voices carry farther than me
I seek your help so that my song may become free
Two voices carry farther than me

And in the morning, sing me love
And in the afternoon, it's love
And in the evening, if they love
And in the morning, wake up

And if we sing together, love will sing along
Two voices carry farther than one
Together we can bridge a chorus to the dawn
Two voices carry far... all the days

Time and mind they melt away
Like the stars and songs of yesterday
Like the melody you can't recall
But the harmonies you felt them all the days

This song of solitude has sung its melody
Two voices carry farther than me
I seek your help, so that song may become free
Two voices carry farther than me

And in the morning, sing me love
And in the afternoon, it's love
And in the evening, is there love?
And in the morning, wake up


And if we sing together, love will sing along
Two voices carry farther than one
Together we can bridge a chorus to the dawn
Two voices carry farther than one, farther than one, carry on
And in the morning, wake upEmbed
