In The Lion LyricsNa na na na na na na but
I want to stay…
I feel the love, I feel the love
I feel the love, I feel the love
Na na na na na na na but
I want to stay…
In the lion, there's a heart a-breaking by the fire
And in the fire, there's a flame that want to be the waterfall
In the water, there's a fishy swimming by the lovers
And in the lover, there's a tear that gonna be the inferno
In the lion, there's a heart breaking by the fire
But in the fire, there's a heat to melt the cage around your soul
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the power
It's getting weirder by the hour
The world is fucked up but I want to stay
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the power
I'm tough enough to be a flower
The world is fucked up but I want to stay
In the lion, I was holidaying as a vegan
I was eaten by a so sophisticated animal
We went walking by the slopes of Kilimanjaro
When the sparrow had to light a match to make the waterfall
In the water, there's a price in heating by the fire
But in the fire, there's a heat to melt the cage around your soul
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the power
It's getting weird by the hour
The world is fucked up but I want to stay
I feel the love, I feel the love, I feel the power
I'm tough enough to be a flower
The world is fucked up but I want to stay
I feel the love, I feel the love
I feel the love, I feel the love
Na na na na na na na but
I want to stay…Embed
