They Were Wrong Lyrics"Here, son, watch the dog eat dog"
He spoke with eyes of the stiffest blue
He peeled my fists, said "let it go"
Saying, "Hope like that and you'll never grow"

I'll go dancing with disease, darling please
They are wrong
I'll go swinging, singing peace, darling please
They are wrong
I say they been here for too long - they are wrong
They are wrong
So, to my child not yet born
I've just one world of which to warn
It lives in the mouths of choking dreams
Sickness like that you've never seen
