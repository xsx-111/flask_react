Country Calling LyricsWell I guess I'm moving on
Out this city
I'm so tired of leaving, tired of breathing dirt
Well I packed all my things today
Oh God! I could not stay!
Country calling, yeah I got to leave LA
Well I packed all my things today
Oh God! I could not stay!
Country calling, yeah I got to leave LA

I'll be your man with strong arms, hold on
I'll be your man with strong arms, hold on
Love you, of you, anything that I might do!
Think I'm tasting clean air
Pouring through the window
Heading to the country, gonna raise a family there
I'm a mess like you wouldn't believe
All the stress I had to leave
Now bring me the country
Yeah, I've got to leave LA (moving on, moving on)
This, where I was born
All my life I called it home
Country calling, yeah I've got to leave LA
This place where I was born
You know I called it my home
Oh, country calling, I got to go away, away, away
I'll be your man with strong arms, hold on
I'll be your man with strong arms, hold on

Love you, of you
All I ask is here...Embed
