Remember to Remember LyricsWe ride the tides
The waters wide
(So wild)
Calm the troubled water!
Hear the angels singin' all night
And all day
You hear them say:
Glory hallelujah!
Lay your burden down
Your time is now
Turn around
Praise to love
Praise to god
We belong to the water
We belong to the air
We belong where there is love
Just remember this:
You don't walk alone
As the storm it rages
Be not afraid
Let it pass away
Hear the angels singin'
Remember to remember! (turn around)
Praise to love
Praise to god
Call to god
For love
We belong to the fire
We belong to the air
We belong where there is love
We'll ride the tides
The waters wide (so wild)
Calm the troubled water2Embed
