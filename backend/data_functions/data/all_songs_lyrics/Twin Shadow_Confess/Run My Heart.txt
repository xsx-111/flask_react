Run My Heart Lyrics
You don't know my heart
You don't know my heart, so don't you dare
You don't run my heart
You don't run my heart, don't pretend to care

I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start and I can't
I'm not in love
Can't you see, I'm not in love

You want to meet me out in the dark
You want to meet in misery
How about a room, so low and lovely
With the gloom that's above me
You couldn't know makes me dream
And I couldn't weather things I've seen
Like the shake of trembling fiends
Like ache of unused wings
I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again, but
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again, but

This isn't love
This isn't love
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl
You want to be the one to believe in?
Then be the one to believe in
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl

You don't know my heart
You don't know my heart, so don't you dare
You don't run my heart
You don't run my heart, don't pretend to care

I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again, but
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I've been working on making it start
Working on making it start again, but

This isn't love
This isn't love
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl
You want to be the one to believe in?
Then be the one to believe in
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl
This isn't love
This isn't love
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl
You want to be the one to believe in?
Then be the one to believe in
I'm just a boy
And you're just a girl

You hear what you want to believe
But you don't owe me
And I don't owe you nothing3Embed
