Golden Light Lyrics
I met you first, I heard your voice on the telephone
And then again, the city street where you walked alone
And when you came out of the dark, I was waiting there
I said, "I could take you now, if you could take me anywhere"
Don't be scared

Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
And if I chase after you
Doesn't mean that it's true

Some people say there's a golden light
If I'm the golden light
If you chase after me
Doesn't mean you can see

I've been tryin' to recall, but I can't hear it at all
The things we said that day
And my memory's dark and might follow it on
Disturbing things you say like
"It's been so long, so long since a pretty boy fell in love"
Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
And if I chase after you
Doesn't mean that it's true

Some people say there's a golden light
If I'm the golden light
If you chase after me
Doesn't mean you can see

I'll follow, I'll follow you
I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow you
I'll follow
If you chase after me
Doesn't mean you can see

Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
And if I chase after you
Doesn't mean that it's true
Golden light
You're the golden light
Some people say you're the golden light
You're the golden light

Some people say there's a golden light
You're the golden light
And if I chase after you
Doesn't mean that it's true3Embed
