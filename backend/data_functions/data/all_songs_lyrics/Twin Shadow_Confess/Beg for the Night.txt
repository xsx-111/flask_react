Beg for the Night Lyrics
Don't beg for the night
Feel a bit more
Don't cry in the dark
Just open the door
I want all the words
Sung from your lips
I know it's absurd
To shake when we kiss

Here it comes
Here it comes
Here comes your love
Belongs to the new you
Here comes your summer
I have to be with you

When this loss starts, it won't hurt anymore
Will you need me again? You've been all on your own
When this loss starts, won't hurt anymore
If you need me again, let me know

I'm in love with the light
Just show a bit more
I'll wait for the night
If you open the door
I want every word
I'm hung on your lips
I know it's absurd
Just cherish every kiss

Here it comes
Here comes your love
Belongs to the new you
Here comes your summer
I have to be with you

When this loss starts, it won't hurt anymore
Will you need me again? You've been all on your own
When this loss starts, it won't hurt anymore
If you need me again, let me know

When this loss starts, it won't hurt anymore
Will you need me again? You've been all on your own
When this loss starts, it won't hurt anymore
If you need me again, let me knowEmbed
