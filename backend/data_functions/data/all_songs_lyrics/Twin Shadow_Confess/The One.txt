The One Lyrics
I'm in love with the unlovable
You're all in with the cruel world
There's something that's missing
There's something about you
My lies with the coldest star
You would do the unthinkable for me

I can't believe sometime
I let down the one who dared
I can't believe sometime
I lost the one who cared

So I'm putting all my love on the one
The one who's always there
And I'm sending down my love to her
Yeah, I'm putting all my love on the one
The one who's always there
And I'm staring down my love, yeah the one
The one who's always there

I'm in love with my memories
You're alone with my stuttering heart
There's something that's missing
There's something about you
All my lies with the coldest sky
You would do the unthinkable for me
I can't believe sometime
I let down the one who dared
I can't believe sometime
I lost the one who cared

So I'm putting all my love on the one
The one who's always there
And I'm sending down my love to her
Yeah, I'm putting all my love on the one
The one who's always there
And I'm staring down my love, yeah the one
The one who's always thereEmbed
