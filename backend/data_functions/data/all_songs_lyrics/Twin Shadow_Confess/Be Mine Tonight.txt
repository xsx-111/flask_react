Be Mine Tonight Lyrics
Tell me again what you believe
I won't believe about anything
Somebody's sinking
The water aches

Tell me I'm no one, I've been like a thief
Hole like the water, it's all around me
In the seconds before the moments you leave
Just let me say this

Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home

Tell me again what you believe
Let one thing be broken
Close the door
And leave the ending open
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home

Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go home
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
You're mine tonight
If you can't go home
If you can't go homeEmbed
