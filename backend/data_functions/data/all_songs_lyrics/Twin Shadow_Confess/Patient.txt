Patient LyricsYou are adored, but you say you're alone
Like I'm nothing at all
That's how you punish me
By always letting me fall
I've built a sanctuary for your troubles and doubts
And there I pray for you
And now you look at me
Like I wasn't true
And maybe you don't want no one to find out
That I am kissing you
Maybe you don't want no one to find out
That I was the one taking love from you
Patient, I'm waiting for you to give up everything
And say just what you mean
I am patiently waiting for you to give up everything
And say just what you mean
I want to be adorned by your lips and your hands
Can't seem to tell you this
When you analyze
Every single kiss
You tell me you're just the same, boys will be boys
This was a game
And you don't want no one to find out
That I was the one playing games with you
Patient, I'm waiting for you to give up everything
And say just what you mean
I am patiently waiting for you to say just what you mean
And give up everything
Patient, I'm waiting for you to give up everything
And say just what you mean
I am patiently waiting for you to say just what you mean
And give up everything
I am patiently waiting for you to give up everything
And say just what you mean
I am patiently waiting for you to say just what you mean
And give up everything
I am patiently waiting for you to give up everything
And say just what you mean
I am patiently waiting for you to say just what you mean
And give up everythingEmbed
