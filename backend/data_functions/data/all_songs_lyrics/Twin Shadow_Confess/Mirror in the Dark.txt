Mirror in the Dark Lyrics
Wanted me to see you like a ghost
Wanted me to break apart then lover comes close
So you can be alone
Throwing me around, 'round, 'round

I want you to look into my face
And I want you take apart this place
Then tell me everything that you found, found, found
We are going down, down, down

I've tried pleasure, I've tried pain
It's al-always
I've tried holding you again
It's al-always too much, you and me
We can learn to be still
But we will always be broken

I've tried pleasure, I've tried pain
It's al-always
I've tried holding you again
It's al-always too much, you and me
We can learn to be still
But we will always be broken


The finest words I ever wrote to you
I'm just a mirror in the dark
Seeking out a long lost look from you
Tear down your heart
Tell your heart
I won't let you down, down, down


I've tried pleasure, I've tried pain
It's al-always
I've tried holding you again
It's al-always too much, you and me
We can learn to be still
But we will always be broken

I've tried pleasure, I've tried pain
It's al-always
I've tried holding you again
It's al-always too much, you and me
We can learn to be still
But we will always be brokenEmbed
