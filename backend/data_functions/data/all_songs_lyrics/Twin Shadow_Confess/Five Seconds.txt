Five Seconds Lyrics
Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
She said, five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart

Linking arms to the right time
Drop your head to please mine
Give her a sign

I don't believe in you
You don't believe in me
So how could you make me cry?

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
There's no way to forget it all

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
Five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
She said, five seconds in your heart
Straight to your heart
I can't get to your heart
Nothing there to take back
But you're faint
You can't lose anymore
And I'm estranged
Look at your face

When it comes, it sounds like...
And when it comes, we kiss
When it comes, it sounds like...
And when it comes, we kiss

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
She said, five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
There's no way to forget it all

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
I'm not trying to make you cry

I don't believe in you
You don't believe in me
So how could you make me cry?
There's no way to forget it all
I don't know why
But I'm not trying to make you cry

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart
There's no way to forget it all
I don't know why
But I'm not trying to make you cry

Five seconds in your heart
Straight to the heart
I can't get to your heart2Embed
