Give Me Back My Man Lyrics
She cuts her hair
And you call his name
Wishin' everything could be the same
Like when she had him

I'll give you fish
I'll give you candy
I'll give you everything I have in my hand

Walking out of Korvettes
Package in her hand
Motions to all the seabirds
Throws divinity on the sand

I'll give you fish
I'll give you candy
I'll give you everything I have in my hand

Give me, give back my man
Give me, give back my man
Head's in a whirlpool
Spinning round and round
If she don't get her man back
She's gonna drown

I'll give you fish (Watch that motorboat)
I'll give you candy (She's in the motorboat)
I'll give you everything I have in my hand
(Her man's at the bottom of, give her back her man)

Give her, give back her man (I'll give you fish, I'll give you candy)
(I'll give you everything I have in my hand) Oh oh, woah, oh, oh
I'll give you fish (Oh)
I'll give you candy (Oh, woah, oh, oh)
I'll give you everything I have in my hand (Oh, oh woah, oh, oh, woah)

I'll give you fish
I'll give you candy
I'll give you everything I have in my hand1Embed
