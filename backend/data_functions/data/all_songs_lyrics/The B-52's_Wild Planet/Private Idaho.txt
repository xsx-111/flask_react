Private Idaho LyricsHoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo

You're livin' in your own Private Idaho
Livin' in your own Private Idaho
Underground like a wild potato
Don't go on the patio
Beware of the pool
Blue bottomless pool
It leads you straight right through the gate
That opens on the pool

You're livin' in your own Private Idaho
You're livin' in your own Private Idaho
Keep off the path, beware of the gate
(Your own Private Idaho)
Watch out for signs that say "hidden driveways"
(Your own Private Idaho)
(Whoa, oh, whoa-oh...)
Don't let the chlorine in your eyes
Blind you to the awful surprise
(Yeah!)
That's awaitin' for you at
The bottom of the bottomless blue, blue
Blue pool
'
You're livin' in your own Private Idaho
Idaho
You're outta control, the rivers that roll
You fell into the water and down to Idaho
Get outta the state
Get outta the state you're in
You better beware

You're livin' in your own Private Idaho
You're livin' in your own Private Idaho
Keep off the patio
(Your own Private Idaho)
Keep off the path
(Your own Private Idaho)
(Whoa, oh, whoa-oh...)
The lawn may be green but you better not be seen
Walkin' through a gate that leads you down
(Yeah!)
Down to a pool fraught with danger
It's a pool full of strangers

Hey! You're livin' in your own Private Idaho
Where do I go from here to a better state than this?
Well, don't be blind to the big surprise
Swimmin' round and round like the deadly hand
Of a radium clock at the bottom of the pool
I-I-I-daho
I-I-I-daho
Woah oh oh woah oh oh woah oh oh
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Get outta the state
Get outta the state
You're livin' in your own Private Idaho
Livin' in your own Private...Idaho1Embed
