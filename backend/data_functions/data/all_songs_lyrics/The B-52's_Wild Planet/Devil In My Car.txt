Devil In My Car LyricsHelp, the devil's in my car
Help, the devil's in my car
Help, the devil's in my car
Devil's in my car, whoa please
Let me be alone
We're really tearin' tar
We're goin' 90 miles an hour
Ho, he's drivin' me crazy
He's drivin' me to hell now
He's pointin' his pitchfork at me
He's in the front seat of my car
He's takin' over
Ooh, he ripped my upholstery
He's at the wheel
Help, the devil's in my car
Help, he's drivin' too far
Oh
Whoa, I can't lock the door
I can't put on my safety belt
There's nothing for me to do but yell help
Devil's in my car
I'm goin' to hell in my old Chevrolet
I don't know which way
Oh, help, devil's in my car
Yeah, yeah, he's gone too far
I won't see you tomorrow
I won't see you anymore
He's got his cloven hoof on the clutch
Oh, auh I'm sittin' on his tail
Oh oh, I don't wanna go to hell
(I don't wanna go to the devil)
He's in my car, in my car, in my car
Ohh, wahhh
The radio gives me static
There's nothin' on my CB
Oh, help, the devil's in my car
Oh, he's in my car, he's in my car
The devil's in my car
We're turnin' off the road
Oh, where ya taking me devil?
Oh, he's grinnin' door to door
He's got his cloven hoof on the clutch
Help me
Oh, I don't wanna go to hell
(I don't wanna go to the devil)
He's in my car
Freeway to hell
We're burnin' up the road
Freeway to hell
(Right through the tollbooth)
We're burnin' up the road
Freeway to hell
(Right through the guardrail)
Freeway to hell
(Across the median)
We're burnin' up the road
Freeway to hell
(Would you slow down?)
We're burnin' up the road
I've got the devil juice in my carburator
I've got the devil in my cigarette lighter
I don't need no battery
(I got the devil in my car)
In my car, in my car
In my car, in my car
In my car, in my car
In my car, in my car
