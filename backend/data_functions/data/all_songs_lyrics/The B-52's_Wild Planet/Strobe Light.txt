Strobe Light LyricsWhere's my telephone?
Is that you baby?
(Yeah!)
Got something to tell ya
(Oh, what?)
I wanna see ya tonight
I want you to walk in the door
I want you to lay on the floor
Cause tonight's the night
We make love under a strobe light
Underneath the strobe light
Wanna make love to you under the strobe light
Wanna make love to you under the strobe light
Strobe light, wooooooah, strobe light, wooooooah, yeah!
Pulsin' light goes to my head!
Everything I see is red!
Baby, when I kiss your hair
I feel electricity in the air
I'm gonna kiss your eyes. (gasp)
Then I'm gonna kiss your neck. (groan)
Then I'm gonna kiss your tummy. (oooh!)
Then I'm gonna kiss your PINEAPPLE! (shriek!)
Tonight's the night for love under the light
Strobe light, strobe light
Underneath the strobe light
Wanna make love to you under the strobe light
Wanna make love to you under the strobe light
Strobe light, wooooooah, strobe light, wooooooah, yeah!
I just wanna make love to you
I just wanna make love to you
Underneath the strobe light
Strobe light! Strobe light! Strobe light!
Strobe light! Strobe light!
Strobe strobe strobe strobe strobe lightEmbed
