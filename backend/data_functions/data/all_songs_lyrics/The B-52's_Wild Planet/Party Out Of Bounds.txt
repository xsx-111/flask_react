Party Out Of Bounds LyricsSUPRIIIIIIZE! PAAAAAARTY!
Yeah, we just thought we'd drop in!
Where's your icebox?
Where's the punch?
Ew, house-a-tosis!
Who's to blame when parties really get out of hand?
Who's to blame when they get poorly planned?
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoooo-ooooooooo
Crashers get bombed, slobs make a mess
Ya know sometimes they'll even ruin your wife's dress
Crashers getttin' bombed. (Who's to blame?)
Can you pull it back in line?
Can you salvage it in time?
What can you do to save a party?
Parcheesi? Charades? A spur-of-the-moment
Scavenger hunt, or Queen of the Nile? (WOOOOOOOOOOH!)
Who turned out the lights! (WOOOOOOOOOOH!)
Bombed, crashers gettin' bombed
Crashers gettin' bombed, bombed, bombed, bombed, well who's to blame?
Who's to blame when situations degenerate?
Disgusting things you'd never anticipate?
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoooo-ooooooooo
People get sick, they play the wrong games
Ya know, it can ruin your name!
Crashers gettin' bombed. (Who's to blame?)
Can you pull it back in line?
Can you salvage it in time?
WOOOOOOOOOOOH!
It shouldn't be difficult!
Try not to condemn!
O.K. Who ordered pizza?
I'll be tactful when making the rounds
Be tactful when making the rounds
And maybeee you can save a parteeee
Party gone out of bounds!
Gone out of bounds!
Party gone out of bounds!
Gone out of bounds!Embed
