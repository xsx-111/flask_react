Quiche Lorraine LyricsThe skies are charcoal gray
It's a dreary downtown day
But at the end of my thirty foot leash
Is my little friend Quiche
Quiche La Poodle is her name
And having a good time
On a crummy day is our game
Quiche, Quiche Lorraine
Quiche, Quiche Lorraine
Quiche, Quiche Lorraine
Everyday I take her out, yeah
She runs around, and she shouts out, barks, yea
Cause she's a good doggie
She's a sweet, sweet, sweet puppy (arf arf!)
And I know she'll stick by me, yeah
Oh no, here comes a Great Dane, drivin' down the lane
(Quiche, Quiche Lorraine)
Quiche, Quiche, Quiche come back here
(Quiche, Quiche Lorraine)
Don't leave me, I'll go in-sane, I'll go insane
How do you like that?
Has anybody seen a dog dyed dark green
About two inches tall, with a strawberry blonde fall
Sunglasses and a bonnet
And designer jeans with appliques on it?
The dog that brought me so much joy
Left me wallowing in pain
Quiche Lorraine
I'll show her
Do you see the key in my hand?
I'm gonna throw it in the lake
Yeah, you've been so rotten to me
You take the cake
I'm just gonna lock the door to your kennel
And just you try and come back to me, yeah, you'll see
(Quiche, Quiche Lorraine)
You mangy mutt
(Quiche, Quiche Lorraine)
I'm talking about Quiche
(Quiche, Quiche Lorraine)
