Guantanamo LyricsYou don't wanna hurt anyone
But I do
And I'm sorry
Tortured, tortured
Yes, yes
He doesn't know
Cause of death
Unknown
You don't wanna hurt anyone
But I do
And I'm sorry
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone (Yes)
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Cause of death
Unknown
Leave me alone leave me alone (He doesn't know)
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone (But I do)
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Cause of death
Yes
You don't wanna hurt anyone
But I do
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
Leave me alone leave me alone
And I'm sorryEmbed
