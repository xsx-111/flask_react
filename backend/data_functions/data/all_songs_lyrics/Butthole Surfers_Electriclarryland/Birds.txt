Birds LyricsAlright what are we doing here? Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha
AaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!
You're workin and you already stinks like a finger
Roller Coaster lovely hair
You wanna pop a bubble out you know it's only trouble
Cause you think that no one better can care
Wham bam it's a scam you're the man we're your friends
We go nothin' better to say
So we make our only choices that reminded you of voices
They say that nothin's really better today
I wanna hide, wanna be unknown
If I can't decide, I'll get it on my own
Say you got a leak you know the reason I want a bitch
Said the plais room that are leaving you scared
You're steady and your eye when you're tryin' seein' double
And you never know the places you've been
Can't see it can you hear real trip dine on air
Well something's ready better than they are
We couldn't tell it wanted and it almost broke my heart a situation like just a fair
You can never do anything that's never been done before
You can try a different style but you'll end up on the side of the floor, wasted
Instead of tryin' East and wide redifinded Thinkin' of
We got nothin better to say
Stand out in the gutter we would call a number time and then get a feelin' go away
Oh what hate, wanna be unknown
If I can't decide, I'll get it on my own
Tired of my own You know we like your sisters keep it like a movie in Maine
She calls at my gun and she leaves me at the bind the she's runnin'
I should clear the way
Wham bam it's a scam you're the man we're your friends
We got nothin' better to say
So we make our only choices with our minds and make our voices says that nothin's really better today
You can never do anything that's never been done before
You can try, a different style, but you always end up on the floor, wastedEmbed
