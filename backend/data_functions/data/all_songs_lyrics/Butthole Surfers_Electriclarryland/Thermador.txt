Thermador LyricsWhen I reach into my pocket
That's where I lose control yeah
There's a panther in my tree now
And as you heard roar
Get out of my life, get out my girlfriend
Before I lose her mind
Yeah our buddy gotta see you have it
Everybody knows freedom, you'll find it inside your head yeah
Everybody knows Jesus, he'll be there when you are dead yeah
Watch that sound everybody look around what the hell is going down yeah
Round, Round, Round she goes
When I see the fuck-offs spur here
Sets me kind of on fire yeah
When I seize them son of a boyfriend
Gonna lose my mind
Everybody knows freedom, you'll find it inside your head yeah
Everybody knows Jesus, he'll be there when you are dead yeah
Everybody knows freedom, you'll find it inside your head yeah
Everybody knows Jesus, he'll be there when you are dead yeah
Hey there now better watch that sound everybody look what was going down
When I see you in my dreams now
Makes me wanna turn
I've seen my panther and I seen my whore now
I know what's good for whores yeah
Whatcha doin' girl in my dreams now
Everybody knows freedom, you'll find it inside your head yeah
Everybody knows Jesus, he'll be there when you are dead yeah
Hey there now better watch that sound everybody look what was going down yeahEmbed
