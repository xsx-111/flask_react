TV Star LyricsI'm in love with a TV star
She drove me home in her Lexus car
Like her dog but I don't watch her show
Spend my time with the radio
Seen her dancin on the Sunset Strip
Bell-bottom jeans and her curvy hips
Seen her sittin there with her boyfriend
Good lookin' fellow but he's lookin' kinda thin
Christina, A La La La La, Christina, A La La La La
Christina, A La La La La, Christina, A La La La La
I love you sooooo
Remember that day we played pool
I saw your bedroom and we ate B-BQ
Barbie came from her trip down town
Fifty up and Forty down
Love ya more than the sun and the sky
Gotta kiss and hug ya before I die
Something else that you oughta know too
Did something weird
Christina, A La La La La, Christina, A La La La La
Christina, A La La La La, Christina, A La La La La
I love you so
I'm in love with a TV star
She drove me home in her Lexus car
Like her dog but I don't watch her show
Spend my time with the radio
Been watchin' TV as the years go by
Seen em' born and I seen them die
Something else that you oughta know too
I like a girl named Ellen more than you
Christina, A La La La La, Christina, A La La La La
Christina, A La La La La, Christina, A La La La La
I love you soEmbed
