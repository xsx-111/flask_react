Ah Ha LyricsHello Monday seems like Friday
Happened just the other day
Tuesday came for Friday morning
Then it started up again
What would I do Monday's through
Nothing seems to change
I guess I'll have for wait for Friday
Turn into another day
Turn into another day
Turn into another day now
(I'm not tired but I got it ready da da dao
Get it out that little client da da dao)
Hello no one how will I be
Doing nothing till tomorrow
Somethin' told me no one called to tell me
Nothin' will be home
Some how couldn't I find the words
Can be used to tell my story
Guess you'll have to take the risk
Because it might be rather boring
Yeah it might be rather boring
Might be rather boring to you
Could it be an atrophy
Of memories or loss of vision
Maybe it's I can't recall situations or the places
Perhaps I should be happy with
Many things I can't remember
Battle through the solitude
Get another lonely winter
Get another lonely winter
Get another lonely winter
Half of time I got it right da da dao
Get around without little Bryan da da dao
Hold me stealin' liver garden da da dao
Is it slippin' or am I dyin' ya da da1Embed
