I Wanted to Be Wrong Lyrics
You know where I come from, you know what I feel
You're Yul Brynner Westworld reporting from the field
I threw it into reverse, made a motion to repeal
You kicked my legs from under me and tried to take the wheel

I told you I wanted to be wrong, but everyone is humming a song
That I don't understand

Now I know that the sun has shined on my side of the street
The basket of America, the weevils and the wheat
The milk and honeyed congregation, scrubbed and apple-cheeked
Salute Apollo 13 from the rattle jewelry seats

Mythology's seductive and it turned a trick on me
That I have just begun to understand
I told you I wanted to be wrong, but everyone is humming a song
That I don't understand

The rodeo is staged, gold circle goat-ropers and clowns
A rumble in the third act, tie 'em up and burn 'em down
We're armed to the teeth, born a little breech
Blue-plate special analysts, cells and SUV's
We can't approach the Allies cause they seem a little peeved
And speak a language we don't understand
I told you I wanted to be wrong, but everyone is humming a song
That I don't understand

Storm into the boardroom of the conquering elite
Did you recognize the madman who is shouting in the streets?
Destroy the things that I don't understand
Destroy the things that I don't understandEmbed
