Boy in the Well Lyrics
Look at this, it's me walking away
Look at you drowning on display
Every time I've dropped by, I've tried to say
The water is rising, you don't want to stay

It's that sinking feeling, you know what it's bringing on
You might as well say it
I see it, I feel it, this town is going wrong
It's turning away

You wanted me to be someone that I could never be
My new friends are offering things I've never dreamed
It's beautiful, I'd like for them to take me on

The track mall gang went off on the Tennessee goth
A lunar moth, you chrysalis and flail
The water is rising, you try to rappel
A rousing cheer for the boy in the well

It's that sinking feeling, you know what it's bringing on
You might as well say it
I see it, I feel it, this town is going wrong
It's turning away
You wanted me to be someone that I could never be
My new friends are offering things I've never dreamed
It's beautiful, I'd like for them to take me on

Here is where I look back, here is where you fell
This is where I got up, shaking off my tail
This is where your rope trick started to look stale
A Greyhound pass for the boy in the well

It's that sinking feeling, you know what it's bringing on
You might as well say it
I see it, I feel it, this town is going wrong
It's turning away

You wanted me to be someone that I could never be
My new friends are offering things I've never dreamed
It's beautiful, I'd like for them to take me on

You wanted me to be someone that I could never be
My new friends are offering things I've never dreamed
It's beautiful, I'd like for them to take me onEmbed
