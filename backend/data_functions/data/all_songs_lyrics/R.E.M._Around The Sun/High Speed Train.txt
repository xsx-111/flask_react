High Speed Train Lyrics
When I look into your eyes, your drop like an anchor eyes
I scudded and clipped the sky, just shy of making it
And you almost got away, I told you I was afraid
Did I really want to try, you're holding me to my claim

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
I flail like the antelope
Who jumped from the building

And you caught me on the sly
You've taken me by surprise
You've mirrored my best disguise and
Turned it back on me

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
I flail like the antelope
Who jumped from the building

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
I flail like the antelope
Who jumped from the building
I'll bring you a big bouquet
I picked it myself today
It compliments your eyes
There's love at the end of the line

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
I flail like the antelope
Who jumped from the building

I jump on a high speed train
I'll never look back again
I flail like the antelope
Who jumped from the building

And that's what I always knew
I'd like to have hung the moon
I'd wrestle you for a spoon inside your sleeping bag
Just us

No war, no hate, no past
It's real
I'm here, I'm yours, I'm fast
I'm long in the eye
I'm cry when I try
I just want to fly
Just you and I, togetherEmbed
