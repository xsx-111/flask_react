The Ascent of Man Lyrics
So hesitation pulled me back
I'm stronger when I don't attract
In your eyes I'm a lamb without a rack
And I am getting confused
I'm a cactus trying to be a canoe
As you pan for ore in the desert, floored, I say to you
That I could never imagine a place so beautiful
I could never steal your gold away

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I try to walk like a big wham bam
I came across like a battering ram)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I try to float like a Telegram Sam
I'm trying to divine you)

My book is called "The Ascent of Man"
I marked your chapter with a catamaran
The accent's off, but I am what I am

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I try to walk like a big wham bam
I came across like a battering ram)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I try to float like a Telegram Sam
I'm trying to divine you)
I looked for you, it's my last grandstand
A motorscootered goat-legged Pan
Figure eighting in quicksand

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I try to walk like a big wham bam
I came across like a battering ram)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I try to float like a Telegram Sam
I'm trying to divine you)

So hesitation pulled me back
I'm stronger when I don't attract
And with my hands tied I won't crack1Embed
