Electron Blue Lyrics
You're on your ear, the ocean's near
The light has started to fade
Your high is timed, you found the climb
It's hard to focus on more than what's in front of you
Electron blue, adventure rings with a page
And when it dawns on you, it singes blue
Your buzz beginning to wane

Adventure's laid its claim on you
It's all you want to do

You, you know where to run
You run electron blue

And who am I? I'm just a guy
I've got a story like everyone
But in your eyes you looked surprised
And didn't know where to run
I looked to her, she's found the cure
Her future's already begun

Tomorrow's gaining speed on you
It's all you want to do
You, you know where to run
You run electron blue
You, you know where to run
You run electron blue

So bide your time, you'll feel the climb
Your high it builds like a lightning storm
It sings like pearls, you know that girl
And no one is any the wiser
So as if on cue, electron blue

Tomorrow's gaining speed on you
It's all you want to do

You, you know where to run
You run electron blue
You, you know where to run
You run electron blue
You, you know where to run
You run electron blueEmbed
