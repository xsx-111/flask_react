Leaving New York Lyrics
It's quiet now and what it brings is everything
Comes calling back, a brilliant night, I'm still awake
I looked ahead, I'm sure I saw you there
You don't need me to tell you now that nothing can compare

You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden a frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York, never easy
I saw the light fading out

Now life is sweet and what it brings, I tried to take
But loneliness, it wears me out, it lies in wait
And all I've lost, still in my eyes
The shadow of necklace across your thigh
I might've lived my life in a dream, but I swear, this is real
Memory fuses and shatters like glass, mercurial future, forget the past
It's you, it's what I feel

You might have laughed if I told you
You might have hidden a frown
You might have succeeded in changing me
I might have been turned around
It's easier to leave than to be left behind
Leaving was never my proud
Leaving New York, never easy
I saw the light fading out

You find it in your heart
It's pulling me apart
You find it in your heart
Change
I told you forever (Find it in your heart)
I love you forever (It's pulling me apart)
I told you I love you (Find it in your heart)
I love you forever (Change)
I told you forever (Find it in your heart)
I love you forever (It's pulling me apart)
I told you I love you (Find it in your heart)
I love you forever (Change)

(You never, you never told me forever)
You might have laughed if I told you (It's pulling me apart)
You might have hidden your frown (Change)
You might have succeeded in changing me (It's pulling me apart)
I might have been turned around (Change)
It's easier to leave than to be left behind (It's pulling me apart)
Leaving was never my proud (Change)
Leaving New York, never easy (It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out (Change)
Leaving New York, never easy (It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out (Change)
Leaving New York, never easy (It's pulling me apart)
I saw the light fading out (Change)2Embed
