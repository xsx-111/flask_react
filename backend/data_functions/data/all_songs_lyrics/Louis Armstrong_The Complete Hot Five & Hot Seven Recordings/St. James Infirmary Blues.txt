St. James Infirmary Blues LyricsI went down to St. James Infirmary
Saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table
So cold, so sweet, so fair
Let her go, let her go!
God bless her wherever she may be
She can look this wide world over
But she'll never find a sweet man like me
(*Laughter* braggin')
When I die bury me in straight lace shoes
I want a box-back coat and a Stetson hat
(John B., that is)
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
So the boys will know that I died standin' pat7Embed
