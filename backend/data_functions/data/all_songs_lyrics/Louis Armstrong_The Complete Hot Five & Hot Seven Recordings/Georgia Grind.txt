Georgia Grind LyricsPapa papa, just look at this
Out in the backyard, shaking like this
Doing that Georgia Grind
That old Georgia Grind
Now everybody's talking about that old Georgia Grind
I can shake it East
I can shake it West
But way down South I can shake it best
Doing the Georgia Grind
I'm just doing the Georgia Grind
Now, everybody's raving about that old Georgia Grind
Come in here, gal; come in here right now
Out there trying to be bad, but if you don't know how
Doing the Georgia Grind
Oh, the Georgia Grind
Everybody's trying
To do the Georgia Grind
Well, old Miss Jones was in second place
Doing the Georgia Grind through a stick of waste
She did the Georgia Grind
Yes, she went crazy about the Georgia Grind
Now everybody's trying to do the Georgia GrindEmbed
