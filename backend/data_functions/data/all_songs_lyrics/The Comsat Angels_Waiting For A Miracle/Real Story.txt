Real Story LyricsIs it some kind of stupid joke
Fictions that he speaks?
He says there's another world
Floating in the street
He hears waves as the cars roll by
The city is a beach
He thinks he's in another place
When he goes to sleep
He got the word
He got the real story
He got the word
He got the picture
He got the word
He got the real story
He got the word
So we will never understand
I heard that he lost the beat
What a surprise
Now he's in unreal estate
Until he dies
He hears waves as the cars roll by
The city is a beach
He thinks he's in another place
When he goes to sleep
He got the word
He got the real story
He got the word
He got the picture
He got the word
He got the real story
He got the word
So we will never understand   (x 2)Embed
