Map of the World LyricsGraphs and grids and useless information
Dotted red lines around all the nations
Purple squares are over population
Yellow Lines are resource exploitation
Where do I live on this piece of paper?
This means that and that stands for something
This over here relates to another thing
I should know how but I wasn't listening
I play along but I don't know anything
Where do I live on this piece of paper?
I looked all over the 'world' but I didn't see
Anyone I know there, this tourist information
Adds up to nothing I know it's just a piece of paperEmbed
