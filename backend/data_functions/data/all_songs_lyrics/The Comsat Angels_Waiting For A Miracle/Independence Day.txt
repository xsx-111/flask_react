Independence Day Lyrics
A declaration of the intention
To stop extension into my airspace
I'll put the flags up, pull up the anchor
And then you'll know you're in a different place

And I can't stand up, and I can't sit down
'Cause a great big problem stopped me in my tracks
I can't relax 'cause I haven't done a thing
And I can't do a thing 'cause I can't relax

You've got your habits, I've got my customs
I'm sure you know it's got to be this way
No hesitation, and in the future
We'll celebrate our Independence Day

And I can't stand up, and I can't sit down
'Cause a great big problem stopped me in my tracks
I can't relax 'cause I haven't done a thing
And I can't do a thing 'cause I can't relax

Independence Day
Independence Day
Independence Day
Independence Day
Hang out the flags, ring in the new
We should be dancing on the city streets
I know the tune, I know the words
My mouth is open but I cannot speak

And I can't stand up, and I can't sit down
'Cause a great big problem stopped me in my tracks
I can't relax 'cause I haven't done a thing
And I can't do a thing 'cause I can't relax

Independence Day
Independence Day
Independence Day
Independence Day

Independence Day
