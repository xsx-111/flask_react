On the Beach LyricsAs I ride in the motor tide
I look for somewhere
All I see is other faces
All I find is nowhere
I like a place or some place
That no-one gets to
She says "A town is just a town, full stop"
But what does she know?
Here comes a great wave
To wash it all away
No piece of glass or chrome remains
Here comes that wave again
See how fast it flows
We'll wash this place right down the drain
In the dark a thousand cars
Hiss by my window
A steel tide on a asphalt beach
They come and they go
I hear a beat in the motor seat
That I could die to
She says "A town is just a town, full stop"
But what does she know?
Here comes a great wave
To wash it all away
No piece of glass or chrome remains
Here comes that wave again
See how fast it flows
We'll wash this place right down the drain
Here comes a great wave (x 4)
Here comes that wave againEmbed
