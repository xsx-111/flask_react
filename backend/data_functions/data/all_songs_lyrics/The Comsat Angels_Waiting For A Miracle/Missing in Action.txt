Missing in Action LyricsHello, daily life
I don't want to fight today
I surrender
I'll put my toys away
No aliens came
I lost my little light
It was so well explained
Now I'm getting older as I write
What's that sound?
What's that light?
What's that sound? (Missing in action)
What's that light? (Missing in action)
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
One childhood
The little kid retired
He surrendered
His parking space expired
Wave bye-bye
Ghost writer in the sky
He'll see you soon
Now I'm getting older as I write
What's that sound?
What's that light?
What's that sound? (Missing in action)
What's that light? (Missing in action)
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attack
Lost in the last attackEmbed
