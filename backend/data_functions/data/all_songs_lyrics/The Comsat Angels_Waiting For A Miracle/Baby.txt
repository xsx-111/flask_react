Baby LyricsDon't want to be your baby
I don't want to have to crawl for you
It's not my fault, don't blame me
I won't be crawling round any more
You wrap me up
Poor Chinese feet
The clothes I wear
They make me weak
I'm not trying to run, to run
I'm not trying to run
Before, before I can
The pillows talk
They talk to me
Poor Chinese feet
They tell me to walk
Talk, talk, talk
Say something
Talk, talk, talk
Say something
Talk, talk, talk
Say something
Talk, talk, talk
Say anything
Baby, baby, baby, baby. (x 4)Embed
