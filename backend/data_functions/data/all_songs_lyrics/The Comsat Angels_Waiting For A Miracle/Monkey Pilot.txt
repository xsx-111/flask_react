Monkey Pilot LyricsSometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel out of control
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel out of control
Two thousand miles away you take a shower
To keep the fur at bay
I shave on the hour
Three says I'll see you, four says I won't
Five says I'll go up tonight
Five says I'll go up tonight
The sun casts black shadows on the Pan-Am roof
And an airport detective rolls over
Sometimes I forget what some of the dials do
Maybe I'll go up tonight
Maybe I'll go up tonight
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel out of control
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel out of control
Look at the monkey in the sky
See him dip, see him swing
Look out the monkey in the sky
Look at the tears in his eyes   (x 2)
Put the square peg in the square hole
And the round one into my mouth
Before I fly toward light
I'd take a spin but I don't bet
Maybe I'll go up tonight
Maybe I'll go up tonight
The sun casts black shadows on the Pan-Am roof
And an airport detective rolls over
Sometimes I forget what some of the dials do
Maybe I'll go up tonight
Maybe I'll go up tonight
Maybe I'll go up tonight  (x 4)
Sometimes I feel I like a monkey pilot
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel out of control
Sometimes I feel, sometimes I feel
Sometimes I feel out of controlEmbed
