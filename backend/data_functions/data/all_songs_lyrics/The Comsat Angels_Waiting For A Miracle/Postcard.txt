Postcard LyricsThere is a house in the picture
Inside the house is a room
Once round it is a short circuit
When times are hard I think about you
Four walls, one has a window
One has a door, which I go out of
I just thought you'd like to know
I don't think you're listening
I think I'll tell you again
This clock shows only mythical hours
These books show only fictional days
One system is only as good as another
I don't think you're listening
I think I'll tell you again
I just thought you'd like to knowEmbed
