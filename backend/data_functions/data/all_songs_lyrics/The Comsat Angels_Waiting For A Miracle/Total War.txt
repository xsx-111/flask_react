Total War LyricsWe walk the streets together
With smiles on our faces
We talk nice to each other
And we listen when we have to
Maybe it's just over-rated
Maybe I'm just isolated
We walk the streets together
We walk the streets together
You don't like my friends
You don't like my clothes
You think that I'm crazy
Any other girl would just pass over
Any other girl would just pass over
Nothing ever comes between us
A no-man's land, the danger zone
Look at us prop up the pieces
We live together on our own
Maybe it's just over-rated
Maybe I'm just isolated
We walk the streets together
We walk the streets together
You don't like my friends
You don't like my clothes
You think that I'm crazy
Any other girl would just pass over
Any other girl would just pass over
Any other girl would just pass over
Any other girl would just pass over
This is total war, girl (x 4)
Any other girl would just pass over (x 4)
This is total war, girl (x 6)
