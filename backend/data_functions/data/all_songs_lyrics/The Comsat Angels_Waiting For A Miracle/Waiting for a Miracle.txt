Waiting for a Miracle LyricsSun sets over domes and spires
Like a magic circle
It's over her head and under her tyres
It's incidental
But she only has time for essential dreams
So she's still waiting 'cause it seems like
There's nothing in the heart of the beast
I hear her saying
What kind of life is this?
It's in suspension
What kind of life is this?
Nothing happens
It's party time at the top of the hill
The air is freezing
And the grass is like wire in between the trees
The room is shaking
And I wish that I had more faith than this
I see her dancing
And if I could dance would she dance with me?
But then she might say
What kind of dance is this?
It's in suspension
What kind of dance is this?
Nothing happens
What kind of dance is this?
It's in suspension
What kind of dance is this?
Nothing happens
Waiting for a miracle
But nothing ever happens (x 4)
Nothing ever happens (x 4)Embed
