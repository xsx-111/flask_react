The Range War Lyrics
Your daddy runs sheep and my uncle runs cattle
Nothing can keep us out of this battle they wage
As it burns up the range
Till no man is left In the saddle

Your ranch is upstream and they dammed up the water
Thirsty cows scream for my uncle to slaughter the sheep
While your daddy's asleep
And I do the same for his daughter

If I had my own way
We would be together back in Pittsburgh
It's the only town east of the river I know
And I feel kinda bad
Bringin' our grief upon this poor old farmer's house
But we ain't got nowhere else to go

Three years on this range since they started the range war
Nothing has changed except maybe change for the worst
If I'd married you first
There might not have been any range war
You wouldn't be lost to the range warEmbed
