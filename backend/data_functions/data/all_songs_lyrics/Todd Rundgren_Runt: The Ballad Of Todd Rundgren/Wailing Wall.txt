Wailing Wall Lyrics
There's a grand old maid across the sea
So the story was recalled to me
And from dawn till dark, you hear her call
Down in front of the Wailing Wall

And she cries all day, so sad and alone
Till someone comes along and leads her home
Nobody listens, and nobody seems to care
But everyday, you'll find them there and

Kneeling down for sadness sake
Crying just as though their hearts would break
And from dawn till dark, you hear them call
Down in front of the Wailing Wall

And they cry all day, so sad and alone
Till someone comes along and leads them home
You know I don't listen, and you know that I don't care
But everyday you'll find me there and

Kneeling down for sadness sake
Crying just as though my heart would break
And from dawn till dark, you'll hear me call
Down in front of the Wailing WallEmbed
