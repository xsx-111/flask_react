A Long Time, A Long Way to Go Lyrics
It's a long time and a long way to go
What was once mine isn't mine anymore
All my fears you would not find me
All behind me

It's a long way and a long time to come
When our hearts stray and the troubles begun
I'll forget it if you make me
Please just take me if you will

I know that if you will
Nothing you can say could block my way
Nothing you can do to make me not want you
And love you for a long time

It's a long time and a long way to go
But in my mind there is one thing I know
For as long as we're together
Love foreverEmbed
