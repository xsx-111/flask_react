The Ballad (Denny & Jean) Lyrics
Jean did her best
Denny worked hard
And so together made him a star
And he loved her
Money changed hands
Denny must start
Tallying up things close to his heart
And he loved her so

But we don't always know what to say
When they ask you, what do you say?
No one can tell what's in a heart
People just drift apart

Jean lost her head
Denny got mad
"How, Jean," he said, "Can things be so bad?
Right before my eyes"

But we don't always know what to say
When they ask you, what do you say?
Jean told a lie
Denny deceived
Jean packed her bags to leave
"Jean, if you must go
Before you do
Tell me you know I did it for you
And I loved you so"Embed
