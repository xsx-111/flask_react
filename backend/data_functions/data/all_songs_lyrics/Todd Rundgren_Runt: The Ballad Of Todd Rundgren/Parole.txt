Parole Lyrics
Put down that phone and listen
Baby how can you be so unkind
If they catch me out of line only one more time
I'll be down in the slammer 'fore you count to nine

I didn't mean to step out without you
And I'm sorry way down in my soul
But it ain't easy being on

Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Before they throw me in the hole
I got to get my dose of rock and roll
And it ain't easy being on
Parole with you baby
Baby, let go

Put down that gun and listen
If you shoot it would be such a waste
'Cause any one of these days I just might change my ways
And I won't be around to see the look on your face
I know that it might make you happy
To fill my body full of holes
But you know it ain't easy being on

Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Before they throw me in the hole
I got to get my dose of rock and roll
And it ain't easy being on
Parole with you baby
Baby, let go


(Parole with you baby)
Put down the phone and put down the gun
(Parole with you baby)
Please let me know you still believe in me, hon
(Parole with you baby)
Put down the phone and put down the gun
(Parole with you baby)
Please let me know you still believe in me, hon
(Parole with you baby)
Put down the phone and put down the gun
(Parole with you baby)
Please let me know you still believe in me, hon
(Parole with you baby)
Put down the phone and put down the gun
Please let me know you still believe in me, hon
I didn't mean to step out without you
And I'm sorry way down in my soul
But it ain't easy being on

Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Before they throw me in the hole
I got to get my dose of rock and roll
And I'll do anything to get off of
Parole with you baby
Baby, let go

Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you baby
Parole with you babyEmbed
