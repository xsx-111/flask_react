Be Nice to Me Lyrics
No catch, no strings
None of the usual things
I'm happy just to lay and look
Let's throw out the book
Now we're off the hook
And please just be

Nice to me
Won't you be nice to me

So tired, so sad
So sick of being had
By everyone who comes along
Would it be so wrong
If you played along
And please just be

Nice to me
And would it bring you down if I hang around
Just be nice to me
It's been a long, long time since I felt so fine
And I know your love is fine
I know what's on your mind but

Don't laugh, don't cry
Don't make me wonder why
You're doing what you're doing now
Can't you see somehow
It's the wrong time now
So please just be
Nice to me

Be nice to me
It's been a long, long time since I felt so fine just
Be nice to me
You know I ain't in heat
And it would feel real neat
If you would just be nice to me
Come on think of me...Embed
