Grand Hotel Lyrics
Tonight we sleep on silken sheets
We drink fine wine and eat rare meats
On carousel and gambling stake
Our fortunes speed and dissipate
It's candlelight and chandelier
It's silver plate and crystal clear

It's serenade and sarabande
The nights we stay at Hotel Grand
(The nights we stay at Hotel Grand)

Tonight we dine at Hotel Ritz
A golden dish with every wish
It's mirrored walls and velvet drapes
Dry champagne and bursting grapes
Dover sole and oeufs Mornay
Profiteroles and peach flambé

The waiters dance on fingertips
The nights we dine at Hotel Ritz
(The nights we dine at Hotel Ritz)
One more toast to greet the morn
The wine and dine have danced 'til dawn
Where's my continental bride?
We'll continental slip and slide
Early morning pinch and bite
These French girls always like to fight

It's serenade and sarabande
The nights we stay at Hotel Grand
The nights we stay at Hotel Grand

Les nuits qu'on passe à l'Hotel Grande
