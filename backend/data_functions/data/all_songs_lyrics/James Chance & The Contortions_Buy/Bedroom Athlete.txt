Bedroom Athlete Lyrics
You are the Marquis de Sade
You want your guns to go pop
You want your hot boys and chocolate centres
I can't, no I won't
I love to talk
So if you want me to walk you better find the spot that's not tender

I'm not a bedroom athlete
Baby I'm not toilet trained
I need to put you out
I need to be restrained
If you want quick service
You better use a pump
If you like hard wood
You better better, ah, you better use a stump
Hit me

Girl you're polished to a high gloss
You want someone to play boss
You want to tell me what orders to give you
I can't wear your disguise
I'm too over-officialised
I won't be your slave unless you will be mine
I'm not a bedroom athlete
Baby I'm not toilet trained
I need to stretch you out
I need to be restrained
If you want quick service
You better use a pump
If you like hard wood
You better better, ah, you better use a stump
Hit meEmbed
