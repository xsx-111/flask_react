Throw Me Away LyricsCan't tell the difference between the face
And your infection
I'm running out
You're sinkin' in, be my reflection
I love to tremble, these are my membranes
Let me inject ya around your throat
Inside your eyes then I'll inspect ya
Can't stand myself, throw me away
Oh well, my emotions, it made me alter
It deflates my passion, my hungry worship
Is just one more shackle you can't fasten
It better absorb me while I transmit
Expletive spasms before you tumble
In blind abandon into my castle
Can't stand myself, throw me awayEmbed
