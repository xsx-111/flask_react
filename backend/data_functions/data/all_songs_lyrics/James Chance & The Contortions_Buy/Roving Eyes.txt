Roving Eyes LyricsBetter take what you can
I got a roving eye
You can't leave me wet
I said you better wring me dry
And baby do you think I made it with my most size
You better do what you what you're told
You better just get wise
Roving eye
?
And you're oh so dissolute
Don't you be so flattered if I think you're cute
There's only one of me
There's a million of you
If you can't fake it
I said anyone else will do
Roving eye
I don't trust my intuition
I don't place any bets
Don't ask nothing from no one
My feelings never connect
I don't believe in a better world
Baby I'm stuck with you
Cause I'd rather take my turnEmbed
