Anesthetic LyricsTighten my skin
I freeze inside
Don't you dare let me melt
You better caress my pride
I'm under glass
Stare if you please
You better behave
Wait at my ease
You can bite me
But not delight me
I've known of all
What you call love
I'm all dressed up
For you to carve
You better eat all you like
I'd rather starveEmbed
