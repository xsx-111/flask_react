Contort Yourself LyricsIt's better than pleasure, it hurts more than pain
I've got what it takes to drive you insane
Now is the time to lose all control
Distort your body, twist your soul
Contort yourself, contort yourself
Hey baby, you better twist it
You never never never resist it
Contort yourself, contort yourself
Hey baby, don't you stick together
And one of you just fall apart
You better try being stupid instead of smart
And once you take out all the garbage
That's in your brain, forget about your future
Its just just just just too tame
Contort yourself, oh, I said you got to
I said you got to, you got to, you got to
You got to contort yourself
At first you arrive in position
And then you shatter your frame
And you stretch your resistance
Until your mind slips away
And once you forget your affection
For the human race
Reduce yourself to zero
And then you'll fall in place
Contort yourself one time
Contort yourself two times
Contort yourself three times
Contort yourself four times
Contort yourself five timesEmbed
