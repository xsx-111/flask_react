Designed to Kill LyricsI stumbled into an empty trap
I said I'm gonna cut you off
With just one way, a slap
I got no need to tell you
Just how it feels
All I want from you
Is to give up what you steal
You got nothing to show
And you know it
You're made of all I hate
I can taste it
I can't hurt you enough
But do you feel it?
You're useless
Ain't got no excuses
You're designed to kill
All that screaming's gonna rub off on you
They're gonna strip you raw
And beat you for your 
And I don't care what weapons you use
Just as long as you keep me amused
You want the world beneath you
So you can slice it
They made you draw blood
And not just taste it
You got 
So why waste it?
You're branded
Your mind's abandoned
You're designed to kill
You're designed to kill
I said you're designed to killEmbed
