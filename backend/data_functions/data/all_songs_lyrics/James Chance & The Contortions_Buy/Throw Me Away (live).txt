Throw Me Away (live) LyricsCan't tell the difference between the face
And your affection I'm running out
You're sinkin' in, be my reflection
I love to tremble, these are my membranes
Let me inject ya around your throat
Inside your eyes then I'll respect ya
Can't stand myself, throw me away
Oh well, my emotions, it made me alter
It deepens my passion, my hungry worship
Is just one more shackle you can imagine
It better absorb me while I transmit
Expletive spasms before you tumble
And blindly banter into my castle
Can't stand myself, throw me awayEmbed
