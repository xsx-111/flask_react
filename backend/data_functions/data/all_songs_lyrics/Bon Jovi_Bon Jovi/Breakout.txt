Breakout Lyrics
Breakout!

This time, girl, I've had enough
You're too hot to handle with kid gloves
It's too late, I hear a knock on the door
The game's over, baby, I can't take it no more

Breakout (breakout)
Take these chains from me
You held my heart for ransom
Baby, set it free
Breakout (breakout)
Your lies can't hide what I see
I'm better off on my own

Promises made me in the heat of the night (Whoa-oh-oh)
Those words were broken under bedroom lights (Whoa-oh)
Your lips they burn, your body calls my name (Whoa-oh-oh)
I can feel the fire but it's all in vain (Whoa-oh-oh)

Breakout (breakout)
Take these chains from me
You held my heart for ransom
Baby, set it free
Breakout (breakout)
Your lies can't hide what I see
I'm better off on my own
Breakout (breakout)
Take these chains from me
You held my heart for ransom
Baby, set it free
Breakout (breakout)
Your lies can't hide what I see
I'm better off on my own
You say we'll meet around midnight
You're gonna make me feel alright
I'm saying oh no, not tonight
You gotta let me go


Breakout (breakout)
Take these chains from me
You held my heart for ransom
Baby, set it free
Breakout (breakout)
Your lies can't hide what I see
I'm better off on my own
Breakout (breakout)
Take these chains from me
You held my heart for ransom
Baby, set it free
Breakout (breakout)
Your lies can't hide what I see
I'm better off on my own

Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh
You say we'll meet around midnight
You're gonna make me feel, oh so right
I'm saying oh no, not tonight
You gotta let me go
Breakout!
