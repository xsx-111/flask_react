Get Ready Lyrics
You need someone to make it last
No Romeos who'll love and leave you fast
They fade away
Tonight you're not gonna be alone
Making love on the telephone
Baby, baby if you can hold on
I'm gonna take you all the way tonight
I like 'em down and dirty, so hold on tight

Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)
Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)

You're looking sharp in your dancing shoes
You got the style and you got the moves
Oh you're so hot, girl and on the loose
You're caught up in a danger zone
Just seventeen but you act full grown
The night life, baby, is turning you on
You want to take me all the way tonight
Take my hand, you can feel the heat
Make you feel alright
Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)
Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)
Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)
Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)


Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Are you ready?
(Come on, come on) Get ready
(Come on, come on) Are you ready?
(Come on, come on) Get ready (Come on, come on)

Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)
Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)
Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)
Come on
(Come on, come on, get ready)
Oh, manEmbed
