Shot Through the Heart Lyrics
Shot through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call love

Would you be content to see me crying?
After all those little games you put me through
After all, I've done for you, you're lying
Wouldn't it be nice, to tell the truth?

Didn't somebody somewhere say
You're gonna take a fall?
I gave you everything
Now here's the curtain call

And I'm shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of this game that we call love

Now you've come back here to say you're sorry, haha!
I just don't know who you're talking to
It could be the man I used to be, girl
I've grown up and now I'm over you
Standing there just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
But you never learn
That I'm shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of this game that we call love


Standing there just a live wire
With nowhere left to turn
You were gonna set the world on fire
But you never learn?
Now you're shot

Baby does, baby, please
And baby must have what she sees
But not this time, the tables turned
And, baby, you just got burned

Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call
Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game that we call
Shot through the heart as I lay there alone
In the dark through the heart
It's all part of the game...
Shot, shot, shot
Shot, shot, shot
Shot, shot, shot1Embed
