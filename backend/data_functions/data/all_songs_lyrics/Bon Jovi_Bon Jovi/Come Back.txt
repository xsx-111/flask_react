Come Back Lyrics
Now that you're gone, I can see what
Was going on and how you lied
When you'd said you'd never love again
Friends telephone and they say
You weren't out alone last night
Can't you see that this broken heart
Is killing me

Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me

Come back cause I need your love
(Back) Got to have your love
(Come back) Bring your loving back to me
(Come back) 'Cause it's been so long
(Back) And I can't go on
(Come back) Bring your loving back to me

You play with words play with love
It's just your silly way
I'm a fool cause I need you by my side again
Now it's too late you walk by
With another man
And I stand alone
Cause I know that you're not coming home
Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me

Come back cause I need your love
(Back) Got to have your love
(Come back) Bring your loving back to me
(Come back) 'Cause it's been so long
(Back) And I can't go on
(Come back) Bring your loving back to me
(Back to me) Back to me
(Back to me) Back to me


Another night is falling
And now my heart is calling you back to me

Come back cause I need your love
(Come back) Got to have your love
(Back) Bring your loving back to me
(Come back) 'Cause it's been so long
(Come back) And my love's still strong
(Back) Bring your loving back to me
Come back cause I need your love
(Back) Got to have your love
(Come back) Bring your loving back to me
(Come back) 'Cause it's been so long
(Back) And I can't go on
(Come back) Bring your loving back to me
(Back to me) Back to me
(Back to me) Back to me
(Back to me) Back to me
Come backEmbed
