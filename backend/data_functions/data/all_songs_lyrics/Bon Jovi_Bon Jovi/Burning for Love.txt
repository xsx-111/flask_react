Burning for Love Lyrics
I've been lied to it, you been cheated
I've been cried too, you been mistreated
I've been watching you, you want action
You need love and I need satisfaction

I'm burning for love
Filled with desire
I can't stand the heat
And my heart's on fire
I can't get enough (Burning love)
It's down to the wire
I'm making my move, I'm looking for you
I'm burning for love

You're the victim, it's in your eyes
I'm the suspect and love's the crime
Tensions mounting, bodies aching
I can't take the anticipation

I'm burning for love
Filled with desire
I can't stand the heat
And my heart's on fire
I can't get enough
It's down to the wire
I'm making my move, I'm looking for you
I'm burning for love

Now that I got you in my sight
Can't take another sleepless night
Oh, no, no
You can run, but you can't hide
You're the only one I need
To feel the fire inside

I'm burning for love
Filled with desire
I can't stand the heat
And my heart's on fire
I'm burning for love
Filled with desire
I can't stand the heat
And my heart's on fire
I'm burning for love
Filled with desire
I can't stand the heat
And my heart's on fire
I'm burning for love
Filled with desire
I can't stand the heat
And my heart's on fireEmbed
