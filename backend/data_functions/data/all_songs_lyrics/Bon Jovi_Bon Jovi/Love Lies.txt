Love Lies Lyrics
I was lost, then I found you
Never thought it would be this way
I showed you my heart, I left it unguarded
Like a thief in the night, you stole it away
Now you're gone, the pain goes on and on
I still hear you whispering to me through the shadows of the night

Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines
You're running on into the cold night
You're just a number through the love lies

All alone you call it survival
He lost at love to a stranger's lines
Walking the streets, searching with vengeance
For a face that he dreams of night after night
Time goes on, all signs of life stolen
Simple dreams were all broken
Best of times become desperation
But how many tears must you cry to survive?

Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines
You're running on into the cold night
You're just a number through the love lies
(Love lies, love lies)
You're just another victim of the headlines
You're running on into the cold night
You're just a number through the love lies (love lies)
They met late one night in the city
Both men knew only one would stay
Scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet
And took his life away


Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines
You're running on into the cold night
You're just a number of the love lies (love lies)
Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines
You're running on into the cold night
You're just a number through the love lies (love lies)
