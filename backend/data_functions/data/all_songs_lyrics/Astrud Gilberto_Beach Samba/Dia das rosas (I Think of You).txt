Dia das rosas (I Think of You) LyricsWhen the morning is cold and the wind chills my heart
When the waves of despair make the dark night so long
When the loneliness aches and there is no place to turn
When the longing becomes too unbearably strong
When there is nothing but troubling view
Nothing but thunder from skies that were blue
What do I do than, what do I do
I think of you than I think of you
I remember your eyes, I remember your hands
And the love you gave in return for my own
As I travel each road wondering what lays ahead
I keep thinking of you and I am not aloneEmbed
