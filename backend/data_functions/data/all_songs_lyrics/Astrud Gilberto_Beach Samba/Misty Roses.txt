Misty Roses LyricsYou look to me like misty roses
Too soft to touch
But too lovely too leave alone
If I could be like misty roses
I'd love you much
You're too lovely to leave alone
Flowers often cried
But too late to find
That the beauty has been lost
With their piece of mind
You look to me like love forever
Too blue to lust
But too lovely love to try
If I believe in love forever
I'd forget the past
You're too lovely not to try
You're too lovely not to try
You look to me like misty rosesEmbed
