Stay LyricsStay, and we'll make such sweet music
Come hear the lovebird, he's just out the window
We'll hear the night sing and bathe in a star glow
And we'll feel the breeze blow slow warmth
So, stay, and we'll make such sweet music
Everything changes, there's light when the world's dark
Moments have silence, but we hear a skylark
We both hear a skylark in tune
For time is running, take everything life can bring you
You know it's true so take it, even fake it 'til it comes true
Stay, and we'll make such sweet music
You ask the reason, the night has the answer
Bring me your free soul, and I'll make your heart sure
We'll both feel so heart sure, so stay, so stay.....1Embed
