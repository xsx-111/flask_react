Face I Love LyricsJust think of things
Like daffodils
And peaceful sheep
On clover hills
And morning sun
On whippoorwills
And you'll see the face that I love
Think of any old sky
Getting ready to cry
Down comes the rain but it's raining confetti
Then think of things
Like far off isles
Two blue-green eyes
And sunlit smiles
And in your hand
The wishing star
The one you thought too far above
Every lovely view introduces you
To the face that I loveEmbed
