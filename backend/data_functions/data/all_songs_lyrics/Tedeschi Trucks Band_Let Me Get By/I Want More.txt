I Want More Lyrics
Caught up in loneliness
The blues beget the blues
Open up your eyes
And do what you wanna do well
I’ll wait ‘til morning comes before I'll go

So do what you want to do
The way that your mama taught you
Do what you need, baby
I want to hear you sing
I got your rhythm alright

Open up my heart
And do what you want to do well
But I won’t ever believe
That your love is all you can give me
Our worlds are one and the same
So let’s make it all right

So do what you want to do
The way that your mama taught you
Do what you need, baby
I want to hear you say
Nothing can hold me down
I’m taking the long way 'round
Can’t get enough, I want more
When I come around this time
There’s nowhere to run and hide
I want more, more of you
All of you

Did ya, did ya give enough?
Did we, did we live enough?
Did we, did we share enough?
Did we, did we care enough?
Don’t you hold it inside
I wanna hear you

Nothing can hold me down
I’m taking the long way 'round
Can’t get enough, I want more
When I come around this time
There’s nowhere to run and hide
I want more, more of you
All of you
I want to hear you say babyEmbed
