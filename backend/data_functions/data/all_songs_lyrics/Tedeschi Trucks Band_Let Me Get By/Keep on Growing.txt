Keep on Growing Lyrics
I was laughing, playing in the streets
I was unknowing, I fleeted from my faith
Lately, dreamer that will never really show it
I got to look, look away

I was a young girl, when I shook your stage
You walked right into my life, doorway, love story
Gotta keep on growing, keep on growing
Keep on growing, yeh, yeh, yeah

I was standing, steering in the face of my new lover
Feeling is so strange
Growing, treated love that she could  understand
But the 

She took me by the hand, told me that I was lost
She said she gonna keep on, alright boy
Oh, just in love
Keep on growing, keep on growing
Keep on growing, yeh, yeh, yeah
Baby
Baby, something that we knew 
She left you when it's huge
Had me walk in, together hand in-hand
We go on forever, yes you knew
Now times has going to changes, Lord and know it's you
And our lover is going to keep on, growing, growing, growing
Not, not  overdue, oh

Gotta keep on growing, keep on growing
Keep on growing, yeh, yeh, yeah
Gotta keep on growing, keep on growing
Keep on growing, yeh, yeh, yeahEmbed
