Laugh About It Lyrics
You can laugh about it
Something’s in the air
You can cry about it
No one really cares
No, nobody sees it
You can sing about it
Sing it in a prayer
You can scream about it
Hands up in the air
No, you're not s'posed to feel it
But now, now that we’ve seen it

Rise up, right where they pushed you down
Don’t let nobody ever turn you 'round
Try, try to believe it
All the caring and hard work and trouble
Is worth the chance

You can talk about it
It was always there
Ain’t no doubt about it
It ain’t always fair
So where do we take it from here?
When life is what we make it
Rise up, right where they pushed you down
Don’t let nobody ever turn you 'round
Try, try to believe it
All the caring and hard work and trouble
Is worth the chance

Stand up while you still can
Rise up, it's worth the chance
Rise up

Keep 'em up, right where I can see them
Keep your hands up high, right where I can see them
Ain't no time for freedom
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can laugh all about it
If you will
Something’s in the air
You can cry about it
I said no one really cares
Nobody sees it
Sing it in a prayer
You can scream about it
Oh, but keep those hands in the air
Right where I can see them
Hands right in the air
Ain't no time for freedom
Keep your hands up, oh yeah
Keep your hands up, oh yeah
Keep your hands, oh right on up
Keep your hands right on up where I can see them
Keep 'em up, get 'em up
Don't tire, where I can see 'em
Come on, one time
Laugh about it, if you will, if you will, if you will
