I Pity the Fool (Live At Beacon Theatre) Lyrics
I pity the fool
Oh, I said I pity the fool
Oh, I pity the fool
Oh, I pity the fool
Oh, I fall in love with you and expected it to be true
Oh, I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you wonder what they doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Lord, look at the people
I know you wonder what they are doing
They’re just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me

Oh, I pity the fool
Oh, I pity the fool that falls in love with you
Oh, I pity the fool
Oh, I said I pity the fool
Oh you now you break her heart one day
And then you left and walk away
Oh I pity the fool
Look at the people
I know you wonder what they doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Lord, look at the people
I know you wonder what the hell they are doing
They’re just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Oooh...

Look at the people
I know you wonder what they are doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Look, look, look, oooh
They’re just standing right there
Watching you make a fool of me
Alright, alright, oooh I
I pity the fool
I pity the girl that falls in love with you
Oh, I pity the girl who wants to go ahead and marry you
Oh, yeah
Yes I did, yes I did
I pity the girl
I knew you gonna break her heart someday
Lord I pity the fool, yes I do
I pity, I pity, I pity that fool, yes I do
Oh lord, oh lord
Somebody, somebody know
Lord don't they know
Oh I know they seen that kind a man before
Oh yeahEmbed
