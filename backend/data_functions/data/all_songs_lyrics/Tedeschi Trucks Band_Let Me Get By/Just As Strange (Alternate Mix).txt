Just As Strange (Alternate Mix) Lyrics
I can’t leave that urge alone
When I lay it down it says, “Come on!”
I raised the devil on my own
Gonna scratch and claw until it’s gone

Just as strange to me
Weighing on my mind
Riding on your trail
Pay it down the line

I’m going to live better, baby
My wave’s gonna break at dawn
I’m going to sweat it out until I make it
And be free from these chains that bound

Just as strange to me
Weighing on my mind
Riding on your trail
Pay it down the line

Just as strange to me
Weighing on my mind
Riding on your trail
Pay it down the line
Just as strange to me
Weighing on my mind
Riding on your trail
Pay it down the line

Just as strange to me
Weighing on my mind
Riding on your trail
Pay it down the line

Just as strange to me
Weighing on my mind
Riding on your trail
Pay it down the lineEmbed
