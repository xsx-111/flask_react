Oh! You Pretty Things Lyrics
Wake up you sleepyhead
Put on some clothes
Shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky
And a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're
Here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me
No fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found
By the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though
They're here to stay

Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
( Let me say it again)
You gotta make way
For the Homo Superior
Look at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
( Let me say it again)
You gotta make way
For the Homo SuperiorEmbed
