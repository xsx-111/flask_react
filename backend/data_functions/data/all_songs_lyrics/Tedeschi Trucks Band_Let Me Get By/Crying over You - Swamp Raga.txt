Crying over You / Swamp Raga Lyrics
Why am I fixing to put you on a pedestal?
If the grass is greener, I think it might be chemical
My accent’s gone from major down to minor
In all this scene, you’d think I could find a

A strange and invincible
Sky comes crashing through
This crying over you
Strange and invincible
Sky comes breaking through
This crying over you
(Boo hoo hoo hoo)

I'm glad I caught you snooping 'round the swimming pool
Before I dove in made myself a bigger fool
I took my time and checked my Ps and Qs
Played my hand and now I’m rid of you

A strange and invincible
Sky comes breaking through
This crying over you
Strange and invincible
Sky comes breaking through
This crying over you
(Boo hoo hoo hoo)
 2x
Really, really want to live without you
Really, really want to deal without you
Really, really want to grow without you
Really, really want to know without you

A strange and invincible
Sky comes breaking through
This crying over you
Strange and invincible
Sky comes breaking through
This crying over you
(Boo hoo hoo hoo)Embed
