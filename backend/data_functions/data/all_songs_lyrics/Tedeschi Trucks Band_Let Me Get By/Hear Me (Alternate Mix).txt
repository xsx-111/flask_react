Hear Me (Alternate Mix) Lyrics
When I watched you walk away
I knew I’d gone too far
I’m on my knees to plead for mercy
Don’t want to live and hurt alone
And if you feel like I feel
Then come on, baby
You must remember
That we’re one in a million years
And then maybe you will remember
That we were always going to work it out

I just wanna say
(I don’t wanna see that day)
I don’t wanna to wait
Until our love is gone
Come on and feel me
I don’t wanna
Live in pain
I don’t wanna
Love in vain
Can you hear me?

Since you saved me from myself
I’m going to live for love
Ride the wind wherever it may take us
And lay it down and grow
If you feel like I feel
Then come on, baby
You must remember
That we’re one in a million years
And then maybe we could do it over
Hold each other til the world just disappears
I just wanna say
(I don’t wanna see that day)
I don’t wanna to wait
Until our love is gone
Come on and feel me
I don’t wanna
Live in pain
I don’t wanna
Love in vain
Can you hear me?

If you turn your back on me
I won’t believe you don’t believe
All the days that pass us by
Our flame will carry on

I just wanna say
(I don’t wanna see that day)
I don’t wanna to wait
Until our love is gone
Come on and feel me
I don’t wanna
Live in pain
I don’t wanna
Love in vain
Can you hear me?Embed
