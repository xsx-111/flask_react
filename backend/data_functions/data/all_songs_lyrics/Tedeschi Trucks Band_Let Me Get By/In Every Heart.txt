In Every Heart Lyrics
In every heart there’s a name
Under the perfume and all the blame
In every heart
In every story a face
It won’t ever leave you, so dream away
In every heart

Just in time to tell the tale
(You’d never believe it)
Just before your ship sets sail
(You’d never believe it)
Comes and finds you without fail
In every heart
In every heart

In every soul there’s a psalm
Coming to find you to sing along
In every heart
In every life there’s a rhyme
Raise up the covers and let it shine
In every heart

Just in time to tell the tale
(You’d never believe it)
Just before your ship sets sail
(You’d never believe it)
Comes and finds you without fail
In every heart
In every heart
In every heart there’s a book
Turning the pages, how long it took
In every heart
In every heart there’s a voice
Getting a word in through all that noise
In every heart

Just in time to tell the tale
(You’d never believe it)
Just before your ship sets sail
(You’d never believe it)
Comes and finds you without fail
In every heart
In every heartEmbed
