Laugh About It (Live At Beacon Theatre) Lyrics
You can laugh about it, something’s in the air
You can cry about it, no one really cares
No, nobody see’s it
You can sing about it, sing it in a prayer
You can scream about it, hands up in the air
No, you're not suppose to feel it
But now, now that we’ve seen it

Rise up, right where they pushed you down
Don’t let nobody ever turn you round
Try, try to believe it
All the caring and hard work and trouble
Is worth the chance

You can talk about it, it was always there
Ain’t no doubt about it, it ain’t always fair
So where, do we take it from here
When life, is what we make it

Rise up, right where they pushed you down
Don’t let nobody ever turn you round
Try, try to believe it
All the caring and hard work and sorrow
Is worth the chance
Stand up while you still can
Rise up, it's worth the chance
Rise up
Keep them up, right where I can see them
Keep your hands up high, right where I can see them
Ain't no time for freedom
Oh no, oh no, oh no
You can laugh all about it, If you will
Something is in the air, you can cry about it
I said no one really cares, nobody see’s it
Sing it in a prayer, you can scream about it
Oh, but keep those hands in the air
Right where I can see them, hands right in the air
Ain't no time for freedom
Keep your hands up, oh yeah
Keep your hands up, oh yeah
Keep your hands, oh right on up
Keep your hands right on up where I can see them
Keep them up, get them up
Don't hide, where I can see them
Come on, one time
Laugh about it, if you will, if you will, if you willEmbed
