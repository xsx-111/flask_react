Let Me Get By Lyrics
I told you that times are a-changin’
I've got a body to move
If you’re just willing to stand there
With nothing to say or to prove
Even a king gives sometimes
Even if he don’t care

Forget what we said last December
Cuz It’s been a hell of a year
We'll leave all the words with the summer
Remember what brought us up here
Somewhere the sky is crying
I’m where the air is clear

Let me get by
(If you’re just gonna stand there)
Let me get by
(Get out of my way)
Let me get by
Cause time won’t wait

The message that came in a bottle
Said you sure got a problem with me
So we made you a bed out of roses
But you were the Prince of the Pea
Even a king gives sometimes
Even if he don’t care

Let me get by
(If you’re just gonna stand there)
Let me get by
(Get out of my way)
Let me get by
‘Cause time won’t wait

Let me get by
(If you’re just gonna stand there)
Let me get by
(Get out of my way)
Let me get by
‘Cause time won’t wait

Let me get by
(If you’re just gonna stand there)
Let me get by
(Get out of my way)
Let me get by
‘Cause time won’t wait
Let me get by
(If you’re just gonna stand there)
Let me get by
(Get out of my way)
Let me get by
‘Cause time won’t waitEmbed
