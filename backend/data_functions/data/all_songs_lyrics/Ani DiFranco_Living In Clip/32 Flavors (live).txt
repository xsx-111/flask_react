32 Flavors (live) LyricsSquint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am a poster girl with no poster
I am 32 flavors and then some
And I'm beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
'Cause someday you are gonna get hungry
And eat most of the words you just said
Both my parents taught me about goodwill
And I have done well by their names
Just the kindness I've lavished on strangers
Is more than I can explain
Still there's many who've turned out their porch lights
Just so I would think they were not home
And hid in the dark of their windows
Till I'd passed and left them alone
Hey, yo, hey
Oh, hey, yo, hey, yo
Oh, hey, yo, hey
Oh, hey, yo, hey, yo
God help you if you are an ugly girl
Course, too pretty is also your doom
'Cause everyone harbors a secret hatred
For the prettiest girl in the room
And God help you if you are a phoenix
And you dare to rise up from the ash
A thousand eyes will smolder with jealousy
While you are just flying past
And I'll never try to give my life meaning
By demeaning you
But I would like to state for the record
I did everything that I could do
I'm not saying that I am a saint
I just don't want to live that way
No, I will never be a saint
But I will always say
Squint your eyes and look closer
I'm not between you and your ambition
I am a poster girl with no poster
I am 32 flavors and then some
And I'm beyond your peripheral vision
So you might want to turn your head
'Cause someday you might find you are starving
And eating all of the words that you said
Oh, oh, hey, yo
Oh, hey, yo
Oh, hey, yo, hey, yo
Oh, hey, yo
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Oh, hey, yo
Oh, hey, yo
Oh, hey, yo, hey, yo
Oh, hey, yoEmbed
