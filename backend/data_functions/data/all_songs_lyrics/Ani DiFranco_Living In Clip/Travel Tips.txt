Travel Tips Lyrics{So, okay}
{o, lastly, well, we were supposed to be here last night
I mean, not and you're late, no}
{We were supposed to be in this town, sleeping soundly in beds
With toilets really nearby and}
{But, but, but what? No instead, we were in
We were in the, a study room in a dormitory
At this University of Chicago
And we were having a little slumber party}
{It was like, able, I mean, it was either that or sleep but you know
At the gate in the airport, so, so we decided, well, the study room}
{And it was so funny 'cause there we were in in Chicago, right
And everybody was in Chicago and they could check out
Any time they like but they could never leave}
{So, so and then, oh yeah, right, so and Chicago is just infested
With, with cranky air travel people, and they were all
They had filled up the hotels, so but not the dorms! No
