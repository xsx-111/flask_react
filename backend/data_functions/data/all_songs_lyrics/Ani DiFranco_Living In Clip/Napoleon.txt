Napoleon LyricsThey told you your music
Could reach millions
That the choice was up to you
You told me they always
Pay for lunch
And they believe in what i do
And i wonder
Will you miss your old friends
Once you've proven what you're worth
Yeah i wonder
When you're a big star
Will you miss the earth
And i know you would always want more
I know you would never be done
'cuz everyone is a fucking napoleon
Yeah everyone is a fucking napoleon
And the next time
That i saw you
You were larger than life
You came and you conquered
You were doing alright
You had an army
Of suits behind you
And all you had to be was willing
And i said i still
Make a pretty good living
But you must make a killing
A killing
And i hope that you are happy
I hope at least you are having fun
'cuz but everyone is a fucking napoleon
Yeah everyone is a fucking napoleon
So Now you think, that is
That's the way it's gonna be
Thought that's what this is all about
I think that that's
The way it always was
You chose not to notice until now
Yeah now that there's a problem
You call me up to confide
And you go on for over an hour
'bout each one that took you for a ride
And i guess that you dialed my number
'cuz you thought for sure that i'd agree
I said baby, you know i still love you
But how dare you complain to me
Everyone is a fucking napoleon
Yeah everyone is a fucking napoleon
I told you your music could reach millions
That the choice was up to you
You told me they always pay for lunch
And they believe in what I do
And I wonder do you miss your old friends?
Now you've proven what you're worth
Yeah I wonder, now you're a big star
Do you miss the earth?
Do you always want more?\
I know you'd never ever be done
'cuz everyone is a fucking napoleon
Yeah everyone is a fucking napoleon
Yeah everyone is a fucking napoleon
Everyone is a fucking napoleonEmbed
