Every State Line LyricsI got pulled over in west Texas
So they could look inside my car
He said are you an American citizen
I said
Yes sir
So far
They made sure I wasn't smuggling
Someone in from Mexico
Someone willing to settle for America
'cause there's nowhere else to go
And every state line
There's a new set of laws
And every police man
Comes equipped with extended claws
There's a thousand shades of white
And a thousand shades of black
But the same rule always applies
Smile pretty, and watch your back
I broke down in Louisiana
And i had to thumb a ride
Got in the first car that pulled over
You can't be picky in the middle of the night
He said
Baby, do you like to fool around
Baby, do you like to be touched
I said
Maybe some other time
Fuck you very much
And every state line
There's a new set of laws
And every police man
Comes equipped with extended claws
There's a thousand shades of white
And a thousand shades of black
But the same rule always applies
Smile pretty, and watch your back
I'm in the middle of Alabama
They stare at me wherever I go
I don't think they like my haircut
I don't think they like my clothes
I can't wait to get back to New York city
Where at least when i walk down the street
Nobody ever hesitates
To tell me exactly what they think of me
And every state line
There's a new set of laws
And every police man
Comes equipped with extended claws
There's a thousand shades of white
And a thousand shades of black
But the same rule always applies
Smile pretty, and watch your back
A little town in Pennsylvania
There was snow on the ground
I parked in an empty lot
Where there was no one else around
But I guess I was taking iup too much space
As I was trying to get some sleep
'cause an officer came by anyway
And told me I had to leave
And every state line
There's a new set of laws
And every police man
Comes equipped with extended clause
There's a thousand shades of white
And a thousand shades of black
But the same rule always applies
Smile pretty, and watch your backEmbed
