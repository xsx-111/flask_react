Shameless LyricsI cannot name this
I cannot explain this
And I really don't want to
Just call me shameless
I can't even slow this down
Let alone stop this
And I keep looking around
But I cannot top this
If I had any sense
I guess I'd fear this
I guess I'd keep it down
So no one would hear this
I guess I'd shut my mouth
And rethink a minute
But I can't shut it now
'cause there's something in it
We're in a room without a door
And I am sure without a doubt
They're gonna want to know
How we got in here
And they're gonna want to know
How we plan to get out
We better have a good explanation
For all the fun that we had
'cause they are coming for us, babe
And they are going to be mad
Yeah they're going to be mad at us
This is my skeleton
This is the skin it's in
That is according to light
And gravity
I'll take off my disguise
The mask you met me in
'cause I got something
For you to see
Just gimme your skeleton
Give me the skin it's in
Yeah baby, this is you
According to me
I never avert my eyes
I never compromise
So never never mind
The poetry
I gotta cover my butt 'cause I covet
Another man's wife
I gotta divide my emotions
Into wrong and right
Then I get to see how close I can get to it
Without giving in
Then I get to rub up against it
Till I break the skin
Rub up against it
Till I break the skin
They're gonna be mad at us
Thy're gonna be mad at me and you
Thy're gonna be mad at us
And all the things
We want to do
Just please don't name this
Please don't explain this
Just blame it all on me
Say I was shameless
Say I couldn't slow it down
Let alone stop it
And say you just hung around
'cause you couldn't top it1Embed
