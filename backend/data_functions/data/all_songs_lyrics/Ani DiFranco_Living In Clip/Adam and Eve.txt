Adam and Eve LyricsTonight you stoop to my level
I'm your mangy little whore
Now you're trying to find your underwear
And your socks
And then the door
And you're trying to find a reason
Why you have to leave
I know it's cause you think you're Adam
And you think I'm Eve
When you rhapsodize about beauty
My eyes glaze
Everything I love is ugly
I mean really, you would be amazed
And just do me a favor
It's the least that you can do
Just don't treat me like I am
Something that happened to you
I am
I am
I am
Truly sorry
Sorry about all this
And you plot a tiny pin prick
In my big red balloon
As I slowly start to exhale
It's when you leave the room
And I did not design this game
I did not name the stakes
I just happen to like apples
And I am not afraid of snakes
I am
I am
I am
Truly sorry about all this
I envy you and your ignorance
I hear that it's bliss, bliss, bliss
So I let go the ratio
Things said to things heard
As I leave you to your garden
And the beauty you prefer
I wonder whether this will have meaning
For you, when you've left it all behind
I think I'll even wonder
If you meant it at the time1Embed
