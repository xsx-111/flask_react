Overlap LyricsI search your profile
For a translation
I study the conversation
Like a map
'cause I know there is strength
In the differences between us
And I know there is comfort
Where we overlap
Come here
Stand in front of the light
Stand still
So I can see your silhouette
I hope
That you have got all night
'cause I'm not done looking
No, I'm not done looking yet
Each one of us
Wants a piece of the action
You can hear it in what we say
You can see it in what we do
We negotiate with chaos
For some sense of satisfaction
If you won't give it to me
At least give me a better view
Come here
Stand in front of the light
Stand still
So I can see your sillouette
I hope
That you have got all night
'cause I'm not done looking
No, I'm not done looking yet
I build each one of my songs
Out of glass
So you can see me inside of them
I suppose
Or you could just leave the image of me
In the background, I guess
And watch your own reflection superimposed
And I build each one of my days out of hope
And I give that hope your name
And I don't know you that well
But it don't take much to tell
Either you don't have the balls
Or you don't feel the same
Come here
Stand in front of the light
Stand still
So I can see your silhouette
I hope
That you have got all night
'cause I'm not done looking
No, I'm not done looking yet
I seach your profile for a translation
I study the conversation like a map
'cause I know there is strength
In the differences between us
And I know there is comfort
Where we overlapEmbed
