Fire Door (live) LyricsGet up, get up
I opened the fire door to four lips
None of which were mine, kissing
Tightened my belt around my hips
Where your hands were missing
And stepped out into the cold, collar high
Under the slate gray sky
The air was smoking and the streets were dry
And I wasn't joking when I said goodbye
And there were
Magazine quality men
Talking on the corner
French, no less much less of them then us
So why do I
Feel like, feel like
Something's been rearranged?
You know
Taken out of context I must
Seem so strange, ahhh
Ahhh
I killed a cockroach so big
It left a puddle of pus on my wall
You know and
When you and I are lying in bed
You don't, you don't, you don't seem so tall, and a
I'm singing now because my tear ducts are too tired
And my, my mind is disconnected but my heart is wired
Aaah yeah, ohhohhohh
Aaah yeah, ohhohhohh
Ohh bohh ohh ah ohhh
And I make such a good statistic
Someone should study me now
Somebody's got to be interested in how I feel
Just 'cause I'm here
And I'm real
And ohhh how I miss
Substituting the conclusion to confrontation with a kiss
And ohhh
How I miss
Walking up to the edge and jumping in
Like I could
Feel the future on your
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch
Like me
Like me
I once was lost
But now, now I am found
I was blind
But now I see
Now I see
Now I see
Huh huh huh huh
Oh I opened the fire door
Huh huh huh huh
I opened the fire door
Wae ohh hey ohhh
I opened the fire door
Wae ohh hey wae ohh
I opened the fire door
Wae ohh wae ohh
Four lips
Four lips
None of which were mine
None of which were mine
I wasn't kidding
When I said goodbye
No, I wasn't kidding
I, I wasn't kidding when I said goodbye
No, fire door
No ohh ohh ohh fire door
Fire doorEmbed
