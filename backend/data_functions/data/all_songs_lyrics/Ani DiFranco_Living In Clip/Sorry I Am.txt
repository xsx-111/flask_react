Sorry I Am LyricsI'm sorry I didn't sound more excited on the phone
I'm sorry that after all these years
I've left you feeling unrequited and alone, brought you to tears
I guess I never loved you quite as well as the way you loved me
I guess that I'll never really be able to tell you how sorry
I am
I don't know what it is about you
I just know it's not what it was
I don't know why red fades before blue, it just does
And I don't know what it is about me
That I just can't keep still
I keep thinking someday I will make this all up to you
And maybe someday I will
I guess I never loved you quite as well
As the way you loved me
I guess I'll never really be able to tell you how sorry
I am
Sorry I am
Sorry I am
Sorry I amEmbed
