Untouchable Face Lyrics
Think I'm going for a walk now
I feel a little unsteady
Don't want nobody to follow me
Except maybe you
I could make you happy, you know
If you weren't already
I could do a lot of things
And I do
Tell you the truth, I prefer the worst of you
Too bad you had to have a better half
She's not really my type
But I think you two are forever
And I hate to say it
But you're perfect together

So fuck you
And your untouchable face
And fuck you
For existing in the first place
And who am I
That I should be vying for your touch?
I said who am I?
I bet you can't even tell me that much
Two-thirty in the morning
And my gas tank will be empty soon
Neon sign on the horizon
Rubbing elbows with the moon
A safe haven of sleepless
Where the deep fryer's always on
And the radio is counting down
The top twenty country songs
And out on the porch the fly strip
Is waving like a flag in the wind
You know, I don't look forward
To seeing you again
You'll look like a photograph of yourself
Taken from far, far away
And I won't know what to do
And I won't know what to say

Except fuck you
And your untouchable face
And fuck you
For existing in the first place
And who am I
That I should be vying for your touch?
I said who am I?
I bet you can't even tell me that much
I see you and I'm so perplexed
What was I thinking?
What will I think of next?
Where can I hide?
In the back room there's a lamp
That hangs over the pool table
And when the fan is on it swings
Gently side to side
There's a changing constellation
Of balls as we are playing
I see Orion and say nothing
The only thing I can think of saying

Is fuck you
And your untouchable face
And fuck you
For existing in the first place
And who am I
That I should be vying for your touch?
I said who am I?
I bet you can't even tell me that much

I said who am I?
I bet you can't even tell me that much
I said who am I?
Somebody just tell me that much
I said who am I?
Somebody just tell me that much
And who am I?
Somebody just tell me that much
Who am I?
Somebody, somebody just tell me that much
Said oh, oh, ohEmbed
