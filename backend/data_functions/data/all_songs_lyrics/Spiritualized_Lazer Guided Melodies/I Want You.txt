I Want You LyricsI want you to realize it's my life
I want you to realize it ain't paradise
I want you to glide with the air you breathe
I want you to set me free
I'm gonna climb to the highest hill
Gonna take control, I'm gonna free my will
I'm gonna swallow it whole like some giant new pill
Cause I believe it every day
And I believe it won't go away
And I believe it every day
I want you
I want you to realize it's your life
I want you to take my advice
I want you to slide with your soul and see
I want you to set me free
I'm gonna drive to the highest hill
Gonna take control I'm gonna free my will
I'm gonna swallow it whole like some giant new pill
Cause I believe it every day
And I believe it won't go away
And I believe it every day
I want you
I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you
Slide with your soul and seeEmbed
