200 Bars Lyrics(Bars 1-100 counted aloud)
I've been abused, and I've been used
I'm gonna lose my thoughts in 200 bars
You know I've tried, but I know I'm tired
I'm losing track of time 200 bars
I get confused, y'know I'm used to it
I'm gonna lose my thoughts in 200 bars
I've had my fix, too much of this
I'm losing all my thoughts in 200 bars
I'm losing track, out on my back
I'm gonna lose it all in 200 bars
Gonna get me blown, all on my own
I'm gonna lose my mind in 200 bars
I'm gonna lose my thoughts in 200 bars
I'm losing track of time in 200 bars
I've been abused, and I've been used
I'm gonna lose my thoughts in 200 bars
Y'know I tried, but now I'm tired
I'm losing track of time in 200 bars
