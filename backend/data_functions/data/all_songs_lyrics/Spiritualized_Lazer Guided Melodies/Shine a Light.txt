Shine a Light LyricsWhen I'm tired and all alone, Lord, shine a light on me
And when I'm lonesome as can be, Lord, shine a light on me
When I'm tired and all alone, Lord, shine a light on me
And when I'm lonesome as can be, Lord, shine a light on me
Lord, shine a light on me, Lord, shine a light on me
Lord, shine a light on meEmbed
