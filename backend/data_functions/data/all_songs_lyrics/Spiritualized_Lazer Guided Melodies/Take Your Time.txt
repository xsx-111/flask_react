Take Your Time LyricsTake your time and back up a little bit
C'mon now, people, get yourselves out of it
No chains can hold me, no walls confine me
C'mon now, people, c'mon and slide with me
'Cause I'm blind but not as blind as you
I'm sick, there's not a thing I wanna do about it
I'm dumb but now I wanna mouth off about it
I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Yeah, I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Take your time and back up a little bit
C'mon now, people, get yourselves out of it
No chains can hold me, no walls confine me
C'mon now, people, c'mon and slide with me
'Cause I'm blind but not as blind as you
I'm sick, there's not a thing I wanna do about it
I'm dumb but now I wanna mouth off about it
I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
Yeah, I'm tired of it all, I guess that I am through with it all
I'm tired of it all
Take good care of it, babe
You know it's going slow but it's coming your way
You know we keep talking 'bout a revolution
But the air's so thin and you're still polluting it
You know we keep talking but it's so frustrating
Hell, you know we keep talking but there's no mistaking it
Take good care of it, babe, take good care of it, babe
Take good care of it, babe, take good care of it, babeEmbed
