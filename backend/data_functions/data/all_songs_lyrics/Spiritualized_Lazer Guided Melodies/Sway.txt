Sway LyricsSlide through the back door
With your life strings attached
I can see the heavens
On my back
Can see for miles
Open your eyes
Can't see what I'm living for
My heads so high
Slip through the back door
With my head in your hands
Well I might not see the morning
But I got no plans
Can see for miles
And I can open my eyes
Well I can't see what I'm living for
Head so high
Sway slow, stay low
Hey mama, take your cool hand away from me
Take it away and let me be
Hey mama, take your cool love away from me
Take it away and let me bleed in peace
Slide through the back door
With your life strings attached
I can walk the heavens
On my back
I can see for miles and miles
Ain't that grand
Well I might not see the morning
But I got no plans
Slip through the back door
With my head in your hands
Well I've seen so many things
That my mum won't believe
This life sure is weird
But what else have I to know
Well I've done so many things
That my folks don't want to know about
Sway slow, stay low
Hey mama, take your cool hand away from me
Take it away and let me be
Hey mama, take your cool love away from me
Take it away and let me bleed in peace
This life sure is weird but what else have I to knowEmbed
