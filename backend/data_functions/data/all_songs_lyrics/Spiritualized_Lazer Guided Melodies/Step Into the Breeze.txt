Step Into the Breeze LyricsSo fine
Got everything I need
You got me down on my bended knees
You know to lay me down
When I'm feeling slow
COME ON
So fine
Got everything I want
You got me hummin oh that song
You know to lay me back
You know it's true
My baby gives me much more than I can use
You know to lay me back
When I'm feeling slow
COME ON
The river cools
I believe
I wanna step into the breeze
COME ONEmbed
