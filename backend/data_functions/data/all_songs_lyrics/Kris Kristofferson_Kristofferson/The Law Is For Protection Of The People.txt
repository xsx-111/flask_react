The Law Is For Protection Of The People Lyrics
Billy Dalton staggered on the sidewalk
Someone said he stumbled and he fell
Six squad cars came screaming to the rescue
Hauled old Billy Dalton off to jail

'Cause the law is for protection of the people
Rules are rules and any fool can see
We don't need no drunks like Billy Dalton
Scarin' decent folks like you and me
No sir-ee

Homer Lee Hunnicut was nothing but a hippy
Walking through this world without a care
Then one day, six strapping brave policeman
Held down Homer Lee and cut his hair

'Cause the law is for protection of the people
Rules are rules and any fool can see
We don't need no hairy-headed hippies
Scarin' decent folks like you and me
No sir-ee
So thank your lucky stars you've got protection
Walk the line and never mind the cost
And don't wonder who them lawmen was protecting
When they nailed the savior to the cross

'Cause the law is for protection of the people
Rules are rules and any fool can see
We don't need no riddle-speaking prophets
Scarin' decent folks like you and me
No sir-eeEmbed
