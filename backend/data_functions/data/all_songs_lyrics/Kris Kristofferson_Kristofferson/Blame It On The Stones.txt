Blame It On The Stones Lyrics
Mister Marvin Middle Class is really in a stew
Wonderin' what the younger generation's coming to
And the taste of his martini doesn't please his bitter tongue
Blame it on the Rolling Stones

Blame it on the Stones
Blame it on the Stones
You'll feel so much better knowing you don't stand alone
Join the accusations
Save the bleeding nation
Get it off your shoulders, blame it on the Stones

Mother tells the ladies at the bridge club every day
Of the rising price of tranquilizers she must pay
And she wonders why the children never seem to stay at home
Blame it on the Rolling Stones

(One more time!)
Blame it on the Stones (Yes, that's  for you)
Blame it on the Stones
You'll feel so much better knowing you don't stand alone
Join the accusations
Save the bleeding nation
Get it off your shoulders, blame it on the Stones
Father's at the office nightly, working all the time
Trying to make the secretary change her little mind
And it bothers him to read about so many broken homes
Blame it on those Rolling Stones

(One more time!)
Blame it on the Stones (Get it together, children!)
Blame it on the Stones (You'll feel so much better, children)
You'll feel so much better knowing you don't stand alone (You'll be purified)
Join the accusations (Be crucified)
Save the bleeding nation (Blame it on the Stones)
Get it off your shoulders, blame it on the StonesEmbed
