Black Widow Spider Lyrics
I'm trying to forget about someone I love
I'm trying to leave a person behind
I'm trying not to think about someone dear
But trying don't work sometimes
I'm trying not to picture a face I saw
A face that has been burned in my mind
I'm trying not to think of seeing it again
Was that the final time?

I'm trying to save the money for something I want
Something I hope will give peace of mind
But peace comes in pieces of pea-sized bits
Will I get enough in time?
I go out to a movie in the city when
I can't seem to shake off a mood
I like to watch an actor and act like them
Pretend I'm a different dude

Eyes on my every move
Black widow spider
Climb, climb, climb into me
Black widow spider
I never wanted nothing from no one
No, I never asked for anything more
But lies are to be suffered and never told
The way I did before
I'm trying to forget about someone I love
I'm trying to leave the person behind
I'm trying not to think about someone dear
But trying don't work sometimes

Always my company
Black widow spider
Climb, climb, climb into me
Black widow spiderEmbed
