Homo Sapien Lyrics
What a time to be alive
A TV set in the fridge
A voice that recites the news
And leaves out the gloomy bits
A god for the modern soul
With even, paternal speech
Hardwired to your desire
The meaning of luxury
Ever since the stone we carved
The ore that became the blade
The spices we died to trade
The gun that wе used to say

"Stand straight up and down"
Speaking intelligеntly
Straight up and down
Speaking intelligently

The sensual touch of glass
So smooth on the fingertips
The erotic quality of
Not feeling meaningless
Reflecting a lovely gaze
Commanding and amorous
A matte-finished wishing well
Seductive and glamorous
The primal desire to fuck
The primitive urge to kill
The endorphins of the hunt
Jump like begging dogs
Standing straight up and down
Speaking intelligently
Straight up and down
Speaking intelligently
Straight up and down
Speaking intelligently
Straight up and down
Speaking intelligently
