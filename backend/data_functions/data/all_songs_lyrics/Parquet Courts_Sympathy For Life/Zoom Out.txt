Zoom Out Lyrics
We got dancing
We got screaming
We got laughin'
And we got feelin'
We got smokin'
We got dreaming
We got relations
And we got feelin'

When you zoom out, tomorrow is now
When you zoom out, together is now
Earth's shut down and space is so passé
When you zoom out, tomorrow is now
When you zoom out, together is now
Earth's shut down and space is so passé

We got louder
We got sleeping
We got heaven
And we got feelin'
We got sunset
We got moonlight
We got ego
And we got feeling
When you zoom out, tomorrow is now
When you zoom out, together is now
Earth's shut down and space is so passé
When you zoom out, tomorrow is now
When you zoom out, togethеr is now
Earth's shut down and space is so passéEmbed
