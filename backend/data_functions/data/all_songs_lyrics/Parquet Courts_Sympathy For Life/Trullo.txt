Trullo Lyrics
I've grown tired of living inside a house that's not a head
Tempted on the porch, walk through the door, that's how it's fed
A bedlike tongue to cradle my bones and hair to catch the rain
I've grown bored of living inside a house without a brain

And now I'm staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball

I've grown tired of living inside a house that's not a head
Two glass eyes to wash so it cries the fingerprints from it
I'll build two and one will be blue, the other will be pink
I am done with living inside a house that cannot think

And now I'm staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeball
Staring out of a glass eyeballEmbed
