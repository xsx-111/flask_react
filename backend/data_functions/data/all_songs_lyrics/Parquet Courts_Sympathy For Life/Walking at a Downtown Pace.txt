Walking at a Downtown Pace Lyrics
I'm making plans for the day all of this is through
Seeing my path and hearing the song I'll sing
And food that I'll taste and all the drinks that I'll consume
Return the smile on an unmasked friend
As we take streets I don't walk down 'cause I want to avoid
Fighting temptation, walk at a downtown pace
And treasure the crowds that once made me act so annoyed
Sometimes I wonder, how long 'til I'm a face in one?

You'd be surprised to learn what you could bear to lose
Wanting and needing, not getting either one
And planning the future as if time is yours to choose
Pick out a movie, a sandwich from a screen
Yeah, how many days in life will I spend underground?
Hours in total, as many as it takes
And how many ways of feeling lousy have I found?
Lately uncounted

I've found a reason to exist
Written on the tile
Of the platform wall
Begging not to go extinct
To all those who saw
How many times now have I walked into that room
With the day shining through purple film?
Combining sound from the corners that you use yourself to tune
Like a piano, well-tuned and walking slowly
Socks on the carpet while some kid watches my shoes
Feeling the sine like a bolt of lightning
House of dreams, you were once my cure for New York City blues
Is this goodbye then?

Will you be on the other side?
Waiting there for me?
Nothing left to want
Cashing in my claim to a life lived mostly free


On the other side
Waiting there for me
Nothing left to want
Cashing in my claim to a life lived mostly freeEmbed
