Marathon of Anger Lyrics
This city has changed as the kettle got tighter
We changed our shape and shot the truth up like a cure
We've got the power
The streets are walkin', a marathon of anger

Now it's time everyone gone to work (No industry)
It's time everyone gone to work (Nor institution)
It's time everyone gone to work (And no city)
It's time everyone gone to work (It's all community)
It's time everyone gonе to work (No industry)
It's time everyonе gone to work (Nor institution)
It's time everyone gone to work (And no city)
It's time everyone gone to work (It's all community)

Our hands is wringin', neighborhood is wakin'
Nostalgia Rx, discontinued 2020
We've got the power
More than surviving a marathon of anger

Now it's time everyone gone to work (No industry)
It's time everyone gone to work (Nor institution)
It's time everyone gone to work (And no city)
It's time everyone gone to work (It's all community)
It's time everyone gone to work (No industry)
It's time everyone gone to work (Nor institution)
It's time everyone gone to work (And no city)
It's time everyone gone to work (It's all community)Embed
