Sympathy for Life Lyrics
Hands free
I bet you are
Touch, scream
Express yourself
Feel free
Come one common feeling

Reaching out for anything
And hold on to a sympathy

Be here
Now you are
Lose all
Distraction from
Hands on a shoulder for
React reaction

The motion it communicates
To hold on to a sympathy

Hands free
I bet you are
Touch, scream
Express yourself
Feel free
Come one common feeling
The motion it communicates
To hold on to a sympathyEmbed
