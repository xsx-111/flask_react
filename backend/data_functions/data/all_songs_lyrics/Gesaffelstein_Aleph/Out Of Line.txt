Out Of Line LyricsThe sky at dusk is warm and distant
Carrying the day
Leading the light to a better place
The horizon sets down with inky fatigue
And the clouds are showing off
Tonight we are a hundred leagues
Below
Just you and me
Tonight
Up there sunken love in a bleach blonde submarine
Justice's way of letting you know
No matter where you going
No matter what's in your bag
Your never as big as the things you are can't touch
It can be a frightful
And kick at you
Never mind
Love is air beneath the water
The pressure start
They'll keep on turning with or without an audience
Everchanging, ever stir
Belong after you goneEmbed
