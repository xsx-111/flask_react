Destinations Lyrics
It's just a temporary slide back in the abyss
I shoulda seen it coming from miles away
Open armed, in a thick coat of structure
Shielding me from my own blades and dagger
There was purpose on the horizon
A destination, tangible and fragrant
And I marched as I knew
And I marched as I knew
And I marched as I knew
And I marched with a thousand
It's not surprising I should find myself flailing
Having crossed the bridge of certainty
Back behind enemy lines with no work 'til Tuesday
I didn't even buckle to temptation
Guard down, with little to do
I welcome old habits like a long, lost friend
To spite you
Egged on by weakened days
Giving themselves up to the strengthening menace of darkness
The shrinking hours of light are grey and feeble
Soggy trees sigh, dropping their leaves in defeat
The temperature falls
The big lights switch on
And from time to time, fireworks frighten the cats10Embed
