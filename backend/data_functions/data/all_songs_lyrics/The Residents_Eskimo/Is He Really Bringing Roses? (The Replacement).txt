Is He Really Bringing Roses? (The Replacement) LyricsI have seen his face before
And yes I even know his name
He’s a pleasant kind of fellow
Even if he can’t explain
He even says he likes to fish and
Wishes me the best of luck
But everyone must have direction
Or at least a passing buck
Carry Carry Carry Carry Carry Carry Me
Carry Carry Carry Carry Carry Carry Me
Carry Carry Carry Carry Carry Carry Me
Carry Carry Carry Carry Carry Carry Me
Is he really bringing roses in a taxi to my home?
Is he really bringing roses in a taxi to my home?
Is he really bringing roses in a taxi to my home?
Is he really bringing roses in a taxi to my home?
Is he really bringing roses in a taxi to my home?
Is he really bringing roses?
I can see him in my house and
Using my new microwave
He is talking to my wife
Complaining that the streets not safe
Is he really bringing roses?
Is he really bringing roses?
Is he really bringing roses?
Is he really bringing roses?
Is he really bringing roses?Embed
