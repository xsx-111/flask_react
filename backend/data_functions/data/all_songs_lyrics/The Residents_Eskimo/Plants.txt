Plants LyricsRing around a rosy
A Pocket full of posie
All the kids in our town
All fall down the dosie
Ring around a rosy
Ashes Ashes
We all fall down

How does your
Garden grow?
How does your
Garden grow?
How does your
Garden grow?
How does your
Garden grow?
With silver bells, and cockle shells
And pretty maids all in a rowEmbed
