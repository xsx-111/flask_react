Dumbo, The Clown (Who Loved Christmas) LyricsDumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
The clown who loved Christmas!
Dumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
The clown who loved Christmas!
Dumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
The clown who loved Christmas!
I wonder if they have Christmas on the other side?
For me it will always be Christmas morning
I will always tingle and get that englash bike
Give everyone great presents and open everything real slow
So that they will always last longer
But they will always be more, the other side has even less presents
I was the clown
Did you the clown
I was the clown
The clown that loved Christmas
This is the song, I like to sing
Remember me
The clown that loved Christmas
Remember me
Remember me
Remember me
The clown that loved Christmas
Dumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
The clown who loved Christmas!
Dumbo The Clown!
Dumbo The Clown!
