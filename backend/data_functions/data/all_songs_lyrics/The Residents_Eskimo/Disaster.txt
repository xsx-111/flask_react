Disaster LyricsOh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
What can the matter be?
Oh dear
What can the matter be?
Oh dear
Oh what can the matter be?
Johnny’s so long at the fair
Oh dear
He promised to buy me a Bunch o' Blue Ribbons
Oh dear
He promised to buy me a Bunch o' Blue Ribbons
Oh dear
He promised to buy me a Bunch o' Blue Ribbons
To tye up my bonny Brown Hair
Oh dear
What can the matter be?
Oh dear
What can the matter be?
Oh dear
Oh what can the matter be?
Johnny’s so long at the fair
Oh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
Oh dear
Humpty Dumpty
Sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty
Had a great fall
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
Couldn’t put humpty together again
