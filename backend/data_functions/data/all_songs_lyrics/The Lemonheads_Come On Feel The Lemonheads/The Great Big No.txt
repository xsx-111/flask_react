The Great Big No LyricsLover don't turn your head
Just let me walk away
I thought I might have to say
You're asking the wrong guy
She wonders how
Thinks she knows now
She'll be right
They always go bye the bye
The great big no. great big no
Great big no. great big no
Is nothing okay with you
Is nothing okay with me
Is anything happening to have to go to sea
He wonders why. the indigo guy
He'll be right
They always go bye the bye
The great big no. great big no
Great big no. great big no
Everyone knows everything
Everyone knows everything
Nobody, nobody has got no one to go to
Great big no
Great big no
Great big no
Great big no
Whoah (lover don't turn your head.)
Lover don't turn your head
No. (lover don't turn your head.)
Is nothing okay with you?Embed
