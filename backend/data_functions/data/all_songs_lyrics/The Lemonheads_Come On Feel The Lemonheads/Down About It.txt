Down About It LyricsGotta own up on my own somehow
Toss the beginning and try to live it down
'n work my way out
I been so down about it
It gets the same every time I shy
Away from the blame and I stand my time
You can understand why
I been so down about it
She's gonna give me all the time I need
To finish it
And if I can't I'll sleep
Over
And out like a light when it's not plugged in
Fading around if it starts again
You just don't get it when
I get so down about it
I drop you a hint so I hope you don't catch
You fumble your keys and I throw the latch
You'll still worried that
I been so down about it
Bridge:
Out of it so I'd hope she'd be there
Talk to her as I climb the stairs
I told her
Gotta own up on my own somehow
Gotta own up on my own somehow
Gotta own up on my own somehowEmbed
