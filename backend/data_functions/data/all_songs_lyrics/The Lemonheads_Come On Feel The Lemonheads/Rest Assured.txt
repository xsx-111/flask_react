Rest Assured LyricsOne of the reasons
I came all this way
Two opposite seasons
I had to hear you say
You were gonna hang around a while
I notice my postcard in a pile
One, two, three, four
Pepper, salt, sugar and tarragon
We're hanging by the pool
Mortar bricks and aluminum
Step one, figure two
I know it's probably not my place
Watch the water drain different way
One, two, one, two, three
If I could you know I'd try to
Rest assured I've half a mind to
Rest assured I've half a mind to
If I could you know I'd try to
Pop it to lock it
Come on let's map it out
It's not what you do to me
It's what you do without
It's not what you do to me
It's what you do without
Pop it to lock it
Come on let's map it out
If I could you know I'd try to
Rest assured I've half a mind to
Ask the other half if I might
Rest assuredEmbed
