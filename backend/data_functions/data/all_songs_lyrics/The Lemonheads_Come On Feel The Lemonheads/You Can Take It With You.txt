You Can Take It With You Lyrics

Found a place nothing's ever there
Made a little space big enough to pitch a tent
A hideaway I hadn't ever gone
'til I whacked my way under the overgrowth
I found a place I found a place
I found a place I whacked my way
And looking back to discover my tracks
Dirty hands and light through the branches
Found myself a breathing place
Got room to stand up straight
And if I wanna lay around I can
Find ways to pass the time
Flat down or on my side
And in a while I close my eyes
You can
You can
Come on
You can be too rich
And you can be too thin
And you can take it with you
Wherever you go
You must talk to strangers
When you visit a new park
You might ask the park ranger
Where you should park
You can be too rich
And you can be too thin
And you can take it with you
The things that you learnEmbed
