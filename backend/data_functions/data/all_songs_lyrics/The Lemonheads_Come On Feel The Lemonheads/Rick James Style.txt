Rick James Style LyricsDon't wanna get stoned
Don't wanna get stoned
But I don't wanna not get stoned
I don't wanna not get stoned
Don't wanna get high
I don't wanna get high
But I don't wanna not get high
And I don't wanna not get stoned
Wanna knock things down
I'm not gonna knock things down
But I don't wanna not get stoned
So I'm not gonna not knock things down
Don't gonna think twice
I don't wanna to think twice
But I'm not gonna get high
And I'm not gonna not get stoned
Style
Not gonna come round
I don't wanna come down
I just want a killer line
And I'll figure it out myself
Don't wanna get stoned
I don't wanna get stoned
But I don't wanna not get stoned
I don't wanna not get stoned
