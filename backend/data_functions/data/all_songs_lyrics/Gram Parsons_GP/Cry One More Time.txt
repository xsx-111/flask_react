Cry One More Time LyricsCry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
I've lost the best I had
Everything is gone wrong
I need another beer
She's got her mind on leavin'
That's what I'm doing here
Ain't no sense to talk to you
I don't know what I'd say
Ain't no sense to argue
So I just don't wanna stay
Cry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
I've lost the best I had
So sad, to be a lonely night (Whoa!)
So sad, it didn't work out right
Cry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
I've lost the best I had
I try to call the last night (Yes, I do)
I knew she wasn't here
I don't wanna go uptown
I know she'll be with him
Cry one more time for you
I really got it bad
Cry one more time for you
I've lost the best I had
I've lost the best I had...Embed
