She Lyrics
She
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
She
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun

Oh, but she sure could sing
Oh, she sure could sing

Then he
Looked down and he took a little pity
The whole town swore he decided he'd help her some
But he
Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty
And deep inside his heart, he knew she was the only one

Oh, but she sure could sing
Yeah, she sure could sing

She had faith, she had believing
She led all the people together in singing
And she prays every night to the Lord up above
Singing hallelujah, hallelujah
They
Used to walk, singing songs by the river
Even when she knew for sure she had to go away
She
Never knew what her life was to give her
And never had to worry about it for one single day

Oh my, but she sure could sing
Oh, she sure could sing

She had faith, she had believing
She led all the people together in singing
And she prays every night to the Lord up above
Singing hallelujah, hallelujah

She
She came from the land of the cotton
A land that was nearly forgotten by everyone
She
She worked and she slaved so hard
A big old field was her back yard in the delta sun
Oh yes, she sure could sing
My, my, my, she sure could sing
Oh yeah, she sure could sing
Oh, and she sure could singEmbed
