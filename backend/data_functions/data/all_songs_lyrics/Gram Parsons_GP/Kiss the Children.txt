Kiss the Children LyricsWell, it's said my life is been so free and easy
But I'll tell you now the story isn't so
Cause I've spent a lot of time down on the corner
Tasting tears and spilling whisky on the floor
Such a shame that it's so hard from me
To tell the truth to you
But by now you know the kind of man I am;
So don't turn your pretty face away from me, dear
Cause there's kids and this game don't understand
One more night like this would put me six feet under
But my heart will still be fighting for your love
Just remember, little darling, that I love you
And kiss the children for me, please, before you go
So don't play this crazy game with me no longer
Cause I won't be able to resist my rage
And the gun that's hangin on the kitchen wall, dear
Is like the road sign pointing straight to satan's cage
And the gun that's hangin on the kitchen wall, dear
Is like the road sign pointing straight to satan's cageEmbed
