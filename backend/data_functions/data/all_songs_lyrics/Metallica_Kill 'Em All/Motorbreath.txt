Motorbreath Lyrics
Living and dying, laughing and crying
Once you have seen it, you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life's about
You only live once, so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others, the same song and dance

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away11Embed
