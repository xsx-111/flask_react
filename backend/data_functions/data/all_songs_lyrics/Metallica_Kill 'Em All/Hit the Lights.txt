Hit the Lights Lyrics
No life â€˜til leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming it's right
Well alright, yeah

When we start to rock
We never wanna stop again

Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!

You know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today
The only way, yeah

When we start to rock
We never wanna stop again
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!

With all-out screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain
Oh sweet pain, yeah

When we start to rock
We never wanna stop again

Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
Hit the lights!
