TV Stars LyricsI can’t play piano all that well
Like, I’m fine
I can get away with it
If I’m acting like I’m drunk on stage
And you’re shocked that I’m playing anything
I’ll get away with it
I’ll get away with it, ooh
I can’t see you in another’s arms
Like, it’s cool
I just can’t imagine it
Would you fall asleep to different shows
Than the ones that we drift away with?
I couldn’t dream of it
I couldn’t dream of it
TV stars don’t care about who you are
TV stars don’t care about who you are
It’s like somebody traded out my skin
For something I could never feel good in
And told me “suck it up, get used to it
To Breathe in, repeat it.”
It’s like somebody traded out my skin
For something I could never feel good in
And told me, “suck it up, get used to it.”
To breathe and repeat it
Instead of listening
TV stars don’t care about who you are
TV stars don’t care about who you are
Don’t care about who
Don’t care about who you are
I can’t spend another night alone
‘Cause the echoes are too distracting
Getting high and diving into holes
‘Til I can’t even dream of sleeping
And getting away from it
Getting away from it
