Powerlessness LyricsThis just dawned on me:
I haven’t spoken to another person in a week
I’ve been sitting silently
Telling myself I need time to think
I met you at the coffeeshop
We marched on the interstate and blocked the cops
The echoes of the flash grenades
Rang in our ears as we moved along
I called it “positivity,”
And congratulated myself on a job well done
But after a couple of days
The fire that I thought would burn it down was gone
Meet me at the Polish bar
I’ll be the one looking at my phone
Shaking like a nervous kid
Absolutely terrified of being alone
So where can you go when the troubles inside you
Make your limbs feel like they’re covered in lead?
How can you solve all the problems around you
When you can’t even solve the ones in your head?
I need you right now
I need you right now
Before I feel totally dead
It came on suddenly
I haven’t spoken to another person in a month
Well, small talk, OBVIOUSLY
But nothing beyond barely catching up
I have lots of things to say
But they’re gonna sound dumb dumb dumb
I have lots of things to say
But I’m just an idiot
So where can you go when the troubles inside you
Make your limbs feel like they’re covered in lead?
How can you solve all the problems around you
When you can’t even solve the ones in your head?
I need you right now
I need you right now
Before I feel totally dead
Shriek into the toxic well
Where everybody’s screaming for themselves
And leaves no space to process feeling lost
These overwhelming distractions
Lead to powerlessness
And I feel too weak to walk it off
Meet me at the Polish bar
I’ll be the one looking at my phone
Shaking like a nervous kid
Totally terrified of being alone
So where can you go when the troubles inside you
Make your limbs feel like they’re covered in lead?
How can you solve all the problems around you
When you can’t even solve the ones in your head?
I need you right now
I need you right now
Before I feel totally deadEmbed
