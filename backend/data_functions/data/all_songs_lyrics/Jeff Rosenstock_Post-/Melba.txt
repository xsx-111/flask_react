Melba LyricsAfter the storm breaks
Fluorescence radiates off
Skin overflowing with underexposure
This was a shit day
Can’t power through the haze
I’m tired of waiting for it to be over
Let’s go back to Melbourne
We can start over because
Mistakes get forgotten
Dreams can be remembered
After your heart breaks
Ears ring and colors fade
And everyone smiling feels like an intruder
And you’re drawn
To the word that came out wrong
As if all along you weren’t ignoring the truth:
You’re a loser
Let’s go back to Melbourne
We can start over because
Mistakes get forgotten
Dreams can be remembered
So go on
Listen to some stupid song
And pretend to sing along
And try remembering
What I’d think was smart when I was young
Where my memory makes me strong
But the record shows me dumb
And breaking everything
Oh, I paid the price for being wrong
I’m alone in this mess and a blizzard’s coming on
I’m alone in this mess and a blizzard’s coming on
Go back to Melbourne
We can start over
Mistakes get forgotten
Dreams get rememberedEmbed
