Beating My Head Against A Wall Lyrics
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talking to you but
You donâ€™t wanna hear me speak
Iâ€™m try, try, try, try, trying to give you
The courtesy of listening

Beat, beat, beat, beat, beating my head against a wall
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beating my head against a wall

I know, know, know, know, know in my heart that
All I wanna see is peace
But I, I, I, I, I wanna fight you
With every little bit of me

Beat, beat, beat, beat, beating my head against a wall
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beating my head against a wall

Beat, beat, beat, beat, beating my head against a wall
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beating my head against a wall
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beating my head against a wall
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beating my head against a wallEmbed
