All This Useless Energy LyricsDarkness holds
Begging me to lose control
We wrestle it back and forth ‘til urban silence
Cuts through night
With a scalpel for the light
That bleeds through the margins
And leaves me semi-conscious
I haven’t found the rhythm yet
To anchor down my life
I didn’t know I needed one
To hold me through the night
Ain’t it great
Smashing through the interstate
Where we guess the futures of
Our concurrent strangers?
They’re on their way to the doctor or to raise
Grandkids of young twenty-somethings
And teenagers
I’m worried of abandoning
The joys that framed my life
But all this useless energy
Won’t hold me through the night
Oh please
You’re not fooling anyone
When you say you tried your best
‘cause you can’t be your best at anything
When you can’t get any rest
Oh please
You’re not fooling anyone
When you say you tried your best
‘cause you can’t be your best anything
When you can’t get any rest
I’m worried of abandoning
The joys that framed my life
But all this useless energy
Won’t hold me through the night
Won’t hold me through the night
Won’t hold me through
Won’t hold me through the night1Embed
