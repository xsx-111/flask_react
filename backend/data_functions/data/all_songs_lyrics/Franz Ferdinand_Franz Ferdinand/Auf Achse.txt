Auf Achse Lyrics
You see her, you can't touch her
You hear her, you can't hold her
You want her, you can't have her
You want to, but she won't let you
You see her, you can't touch her
You hear her, you can't hold her
You want her, you can't have her
You want to, but she won't let you

She's not so special, so look what you've done, boy
She's not so special, so look what you've done, boy
She's not so special, so look what you've done, boy
She's not so special, so look what you've done

And now you wish she'd never
Come back here again
Oh, never
Come back here again

You see her, you can't touch her
You hear her, you can't hold her
You want her, and you can't have her
You want to, but she won't let you
Well, you see her, you can't touch her
But you hear her, you can't hold her
And you want her, and you can't have her
And you want to, but she won't let you
She's not so special, so look what you've done, boy
She's not so special, so look what you've done, boy
She's not so special, so look what you've done, boy
She's not so special, so look what you've done

And now I'm nailed above you gushing from my side
It's with your sins that you have killed me
Thinking of your sins, I die
Thinking how you'd let them touch you
How you'd never realise that I'm ripped and hang forsaken
Knowing never will I rise again

You still see her, oh, you hear her
Ooh, you want her, oh, you want to
You see her, and you still hear her
And you want her, and you still want to3Embed
