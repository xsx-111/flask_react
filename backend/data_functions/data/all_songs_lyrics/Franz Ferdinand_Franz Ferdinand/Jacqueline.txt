Jacqueline Lyrics
Jacqueline was seventeen, working on a desk
When Ivor peered above a spectacle, forgot that he had wrecked a girl
Sometimes these eyes forget the face they're peering from
When the face they peer upon
Well, you know that face as I do, and how in the return of the gaze
She can return you the face that you are staring from


It's always better on holiday, so much better on holiday
That's why we only work when we need the money
It's always better on holiday, so much better on holiday
That's why we only work when we need the money

Gregor was down again, said, "Come on, kick me again"
Said, "I'm so drunk, I don't mind if you kill me
Come on, you gutless
Yeah, I'm alive, oh, I'm alive
Oh, I'm alive and how I know it
Oh, but for chips and for freedom, I could die"

It's always better on holiday, so much better on holiday
That's why we only work when we need the money
It's always better on holiday, so much better on holiday
That's why we only work when we need the money

It's always better on holiday, so much better on holiday
That's why we only work when we need the money
It's always better on holiday, so much better on holiday
That's why we only work when we need the money2Embed
