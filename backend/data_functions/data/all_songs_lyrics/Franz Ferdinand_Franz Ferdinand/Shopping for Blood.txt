Shopping for Blood Lyrics
I live in the Merchant City, drive a four-by-four
Oh, I eat MNS, it tastes of nothing
Oh, I taste of nothing
I am the new Scottish gentry
An Anglified vowel, sub-London thoughts
I am the new Scottish gentry
An Anglified vowel, sub-London thoughts, oh

So I'm shopping, shopping for blood
Oh, I'm shopping, I'm shopping for blood
So I'm shopping, shopping for blood
Oh, I'm shopping, I'm shopping for—

So it's leather for leisure, velcro for sport
Oh, it's a first appearance at a new civil court
Oh, it's leather for leisure, velcro for sport
It's a first appearance at a new civil court


Hi, there!
I agree (Shopping for blood)
Oh, hi, there! (I'm shopping)
Oh, I could likely agree (Shopping for blood)
I am the new Scottish gentry
An Anglified vowel, sub-London thoughts
I am the new Scottish gentry
An Anglified vowel, sub-media thoughts

So I'm shopping, shopping for blood
Oh, I'm shopping, I'm shopping for blood
So I'm shopping, shopping for blood
Oh, I'm shopping, I'm shopping for—

So it's leather for leisure, velcro for sport
It's a first appearance at a new civil court
It's leather for leisure, velcro for sport
It's a first appearance at a new civil court2Embed
