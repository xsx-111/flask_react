Cheating on You Lyrics
Goodbye, girl, because I'm lonely
Goodbye, girl, it isn't over
Goodbye, girl, because it's only love
Goodbye, girl, you know you own me
Goodbye, girl, yes, I'm a loser
Goodbye, girl, you know it's only love

I'm cheating on you, yeah
I'm cheating on you, yeah
I'm cheating on you, yeah
You're cheating on me

Goodbye, girl, you are are the only one
Goodbye, girl, although you own me
Goodbye, girl, you only owe me love
Goodbye, girl, well, if you're lonely
Goodbye, girl, why don't you join me?
Goodbye, girl, you know it's only love

I'm cheating on you, yeah
I'm cheating on you, yeah
I'm cheating on you, yeah
You're cheating on me
Oh, watch out, watch out
I'm cheating on you

Goodbye, girl
Goodbye, girl
Goodbye, girl
Goodbye, girlEmbed
