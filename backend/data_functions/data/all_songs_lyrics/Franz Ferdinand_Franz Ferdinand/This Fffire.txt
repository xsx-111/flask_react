This Fffire Lyrics
Eyes, burning a way through me
Eyes, destroying so sweetly
Now, there is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
This fire is out of control
This fire is out of control
And I'll burn

Eyes, boring a way through me
Paralyse, controlling completely
Now, there is a fire within me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control, then I
I'm out of control and I burn
Oh, how I burn for you
Burn, oh, how I burn for you
Burn, how I burn, how I burn
Oh, how I

This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'll burn it! I'll burn it!
I'll burn it! I'll burn it down!Embed
