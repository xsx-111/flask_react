Words So Leisured Lyrics
She's an emotion avenger
She is the villain who sends a
Line of dark fantastic passion
She knows that you will surrender
Knows that you will surrender
You want this fantastic passion
Will have fantastic passion

You can feel her lips undress your eyes
Why should ugly skin that never feels
Never feel your fingers tingle, tense anticipation on it?
This one is an easy one, feel the word and melt upon it
Words of love, words so leisured
Words are poisoned darts of pleasure
Die

Yes, she's in her black mood tonight
Watch her dye your black hair white
Rob you of your muscles, slacken
All the skin that was so tight
So ask for a reason
Oh, ask for any reason
Oh, ask for the one reply
For the one reply
Try for the reason
But passion never lives, it dies with reason
Try for the reason
Then die2Embed
