All for You, Sophia Lyrics
Bang, bang! Gavrilo Princip
Bang, bang! Shoot me, Gavrilo
Bang, bang! The first six are for you
Bang, bang! The seventh is for me
Bang, bang! Gavrilo Princip
Bang, bang! Europe's gonna weep

All for you, all for you, all for you (Sophia)
All for you, all for you, all for you (Sophia)
All for you, all for you, all for you (Sophia)
All for you, all for you, all for you

Bang, bang! History's complete
Bang, bang! Shoot me, Gavrilo
Bang, bang! The first six are for you
Bang, bang! The seventh is for me
Bang, bang! Gavrilo Princip
Bang, bang! Shoot me, Gavrilo

All for you, all for you, all for you (Sophia)
All for you, all for you, all for you (Sophia)
All for you, all for you, all for you (Sophia)
All for you, all for you, all for you
The Black Hand holds the gun
The devil takes his run
Urban, take the Appel Quay
It's June the twenty-eighth
The seventh bullet's for me

Bang, bang! Gavrilo Princip
Bang, bang! Shoot me, Gavrilo
Bang, bang! The first six are for you
Bang, bang! The seventh is for me
Bang, bang! Gavrilo Princip
Bang, bang! Shoot me, Gavrilo1Embed
