Tell Her Tonight Lyrics
I only watched her walk, but she saw it
I only heard her talk, but she saw it
I only touched her hips, but she saw it
I only kissed her lips, but she saw it

Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight

She only flicked her eyes, but I saw it
She only swung her hair, but I saw it
She only shook her hips, but I saw it
She only licked her lips, but I saw it

Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight

Have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
Have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
Have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
Have to tell her, you tell her tonight, oh yeah
I only watched her walk, but she saw it
I only heard her talk, but she saw it
I only touched her hips, but she saw it
I only kissed her lips, but she saw it

Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight
Gonna have to tell her tonight

Have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
Have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
Have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
Have to tell her, you tell her tonight, oh yeahEmbed
