Van Tango Lyrics
Van Tango had a mean old scene, Van Tango
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
Van Tango had a mean old scene, Van Tango
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
He worked night shift at the opera
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
Watching the girls go by
(Girls go by, Van Tango)
He's singled out, tonight
(Singled out, Van Tango)
He's singled out, every night
(Singled out, Van Tango)

Caretaker of the night
He's the king of the night
Caretaker of the night (Watch out)
He's the king of the night, yeah
Caretaker of the night
King of the night
Caretaker of the night (Watch out)
Yeah, yeah, he's the king of the night

Van Tango had a mean old scene, Van Tango
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
Van Tango had a mean old scene, Van Tango
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
He wore his quiff Venetian style
(Venetian style, Van Tango)
His fags were cheap, but with a filter
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, Van Tango)
He don't suck up to no-one
(Don't suck up, Van Tango)
He don't suck up to no-one at all
(Don't suck up, Van Tango)
Van Tango, Van Tango (Van Tango)
Van Tango (Van Tango)
Van Tan-Tan-Tan-Tan-Tan-Tan-Tango
Caretaker of the night
He's the king of the night
Caretaker of the night (Watch out)
He's the king of the night
Caretaker of the night
King of the night
Caretaker of the night
Watch out, he's the king of the night

Van Tango, Van Tango, Van Tan-Tan-Tan-Tan-Tango
Van Tango, Van Tango, Van Tan-Tan-Tan-Tan-Tango
Van Tango, Van Tango, Van Tan-Tan-Tan-Tan-Tango
Van Tango, Van Tango, Van Tan-Tan-Tan-Tan-Tango
Van Tango

Caretaker of the night
King of the night
Caretaker of the night (Watch out)
He's the king of the night
Caretaker of the night
King of the night
The caretaker of the night
Watch out, he's the king of the nightEmbed
