Take Me Out Lyrics
So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
I say you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say: take me out


Well, I say you don't know
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, don't you know?
You say you don't know
I say: take me out
If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you50Embed
