Michael Lyrics
This is where I'll be, so heavenly
So come and dance with me, Michael
So sexy, I'm sexy
So come and dance with me, Michael
I'm all that you see, you want to see
So come and dance with me, Michael

So close now, so close now
So come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

Michael, you're the boy with all the leather hips
Sticky hair, sticky hips, stubble on my sticky lips
Michael, you're the only one I'd ever want
Only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want
Beautiful boys on a beautiful dance floor
Michael, you're dancing like a beautiful dance-whore
Michael waiting on a silver platter now
And nothing matters now

This is what I am, I am a man
So come and dance with me, Michael
So strong now, it's strong now
So come and dance with me, Michael
I'm all that you see, you want to see
So come and dance with me, Michael
So close now, it's close now
So come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

Michael, you're the boy with all the leather hips
Sticky hair, sticky hips, stubble on my sticky lips
Michael, you're the only one I'd ever want
Only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want
Beautiful boys on a beautiful dance floor
Michael, you're dancing like a beautiful dance-whore
Michael waiting on a silver platter now
And nothing matters now


Michael, you're the only one I'd ever want
Only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want
Michael, you're the only one I'd ever want
Only one I'd ever want, only one I'd ever want
Beautiful boys on a beautiful dance floor
Michael, you're dancing like a beautiful dance-whore
Michael waiting on a silver platter now
Nothing matters, oh, nothing matters, oh
Nothing matters, oh yeah5Embed
