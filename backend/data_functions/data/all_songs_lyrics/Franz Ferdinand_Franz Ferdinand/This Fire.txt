This Fire Lyrics
Eyes boring a way through me
Paralyse, controlling completely
Now there is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn it, I'll burn it, I, I, I'll burn it down

Eyes burning a way through me
Overwhelm, destroying so sweetly
Now there is a fire in me
A fire that burns

This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
Then I'm, I'm out of control and I burn
Oh, how I burn for you
Burn, oh, how I burn for you
Burn, how I burn
How I burn, oh, how I


This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is out of control
We're going to burn it, I'll burn it, I, I, I'll burn it down1Embed
