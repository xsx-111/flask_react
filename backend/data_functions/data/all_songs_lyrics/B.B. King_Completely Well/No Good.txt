No Good LyricsYour letter I read early this morning baby
And I read every word you had to say
Your letter I read early this morning baby
And I read every word you had to say
But if you love me like you say you do baby
I wanna know why in the world did you go away?
Your letter said that you're doing ok baby
But then I read: "Please, let me come back home."
Your letter read that you're doing ok now baby
And then you said: "Please, let me come back home"
You said you were so tired, so tired baby
And you would have someone you could call your own
Yes, my memory don't fail me baby
You know I'll remember the day you left
Yeah, my memory don't fail me baby
You know I'll remember the day you left
You know you said baby: "I believe you now baby."
That you were grown and you've been taking care yourself
Oh, and here is my answer to you letter baby
And the words come straight from my heart
Oh, here is the answer to you letter baby
And the words come straight from my heart
Yes, I loved you then I can still love you now baby
But I'm afraid to play the barEmbed
