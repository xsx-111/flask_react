What Happened LyricsOh, what happened to that beautiful smile?
Oh, the one that you gave me anytime we were face to face
Is it someone that's taking my place
Darling, what happened?
Oh, what happened to those fast heartbeats?
Oh, the one's, the one's that excited me so
Tell me, don't you love me, don't you love me no more
Darling, what happened?
Oh, it's so sad what a little time can do
Well, too much time with another
Careless love can change the two
Oh, what happened to the love we knew?
All of those good times, the good times, just me and you
Oh, baby, baby, before I go
Oh, it's just one thing I'd like to know
Oh, don't you love me, oh, don't you care, don't you care anymore?
Darling, what happened?
Oh, it's so sad, so sad what a little time can do
Yeah, it's too much time with another
Careless love can change the two
Oh, tell me what happened, baby, to the love we knew?
All the good times, the good times, just me and you
Oh, baby, baby, before I go
Oh, it's just one thing, one thing I'd like to know
Don't you love me, oh, don't you care anymore?
Darling, what happened?Embed
