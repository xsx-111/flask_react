This Is You, This Is Me LyricsCryin' babies on the doorstep
Helpless as can be
Lady of the evening
Set your mind free
Grown up in a ghetto
Never seen a tree, oh...
If you don't understand
The words to this song
It's on you
It's on me
If you don't understand
The words to this song
It's on you
It's on me, yeah
If you try to make it better
Try to pull it in
You take it from your pocket
You'll take it from within, yeah
You'll take it from your pride, y'all
You're right back where you been, yeah
It's sort of like a seesaw
Up and down again
The key is in vacation?
If you don't understand
The words to this song
It's on you
It's on me
If you don't understand
Don't get me wrong
It's on you
It's on me, yeah
If you don't understand
The words to this song
It's on me
It's on you, yeah
If you don't understand
Don't get me wrong
It's on you
It's all about you and me, ya'll
Cryin' babies
On the doorstep
Grown up in a ghetto
Never seen a tree
If you don't understand
The words to this song
It's on me
It's on you
If you don't understand
Don't get me wrong
It's on me
It's on youEmbed
