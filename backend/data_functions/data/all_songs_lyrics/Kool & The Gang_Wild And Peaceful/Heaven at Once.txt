Heaven at Once LyricsKool, you know I've been thinkin'
What do we need to make things
Better in the world today
You know that's a beautiful thought
We need peace, we need unity
We need peace for you and me
You know because we are so blind
We can't see, we cannot see the creator of a tree
The creater of a bee, the creator of you and me
What are you doin' to make things better
Well, you see we are scientists of sound
We're mathematically puttin' it down
And you know we're tryin' to find the key to the light
What do you mean by the key to the light
Well, brother you see, from the darkness came the light
We need that light to find peace and unity
Because there's so much illusion and confusion
So much destruction, so much corruption
What could I do
Well, you know that's why we have to save the children
Because you're gonna play a very important part
So you must continue to strive and bring this peace and unity
Because there's only way we can find heaven
Through peace and unity
Would that be heaven?
Yes, you know that would be heaven at once
Heaven at once, ooh heaven
Heaven at once, ooh heaven
Heaven at once
Heaven at once
Ooh heaven, heaven at once
Yes, it would be heaven at onceEmbed
