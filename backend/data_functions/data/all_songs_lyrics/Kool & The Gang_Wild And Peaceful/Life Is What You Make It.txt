Life Is What You Make It LyricsThink about what it means to live
The time to live and love your life is now yours
The time to learn to love yourself is now yours
To live and find yourself your love is all right yours
When you learn to do the things, you're on your way
The time to find the things you want is now yours
The time to get the things you need is now yours
The things you need when times get tough get now yours
When you learn to do the things, you've got to say
Life is what you make it
Life is what you do
Life is what you make it
When you do your things, that's not the way
Yeah, hey hey, yeah
The time to live and love your life is now yours
The time to learn to love yourself is now yours
To live and find yourself your love is all right yours
When you learn to do the things, yeah
Life is what you make it
Life is what you do
Life is what you make it
Life is what you do
Life is what you make it
Life is what you do
Life is what you make itEmbed
