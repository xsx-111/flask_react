Always Malaise (The Man I Am) LyricsAlways you need me lover
For always release me lover
I want to give you the lowdown
I want to give you the face to face
Always is all I can give
Isn't quite what you take me for
I'll act in a certain way
I control what I can
That's the man I am
Well it pains me to say
And I do what I can
That's the man I am
Always, always, always
Always release me lover
I want to give you the face to face
(Won't let you go)
(Won't let you go)
(What'll you do?)
I want to miss some more
I'll relax in a certain way
I control what I can
That's the man I am
Well it pains me to say
And I do what I can
That's the man I am (Coming out of the waste)
That's the man I am (Clearing out of the shade)
All that you've known, be as it may
All that you've shown
Reach in and try all day (Coming out of the waste)
I wanna try all day (Clearing out of the shade)
All that I know, is you'll be okay
Follow your soul and it tells you to fly away (Coming out of the waste)
I wanna fly all day (Clearing out of the shade)
All that you've known, be as it may
All that you've shone
Reach in and shine all day (Coming out of the waste)
I wanna shine all day (Clearing out of the shade)Embed
