The Undoing Lyrics
I was on my way
I was on my way to tell you it's no good
I was on my way
Chasing my damage

I was chased, thrilled and altered
Chasing my damage
Because I was chased, thrilled and altered
And it raised me

Suele tener
Me suelto
Me suelto en el deshacer (please)
Al puro perder el ganar no compara
Me suelto, me suelto en el deshacer

I always thought you had great style, great style
And style was worthwhile
Because I was
I was on my way
Sobrevivir√©
Chasing my damage (chasing)
I was chased, thrilled and altered
And it raised me
Chasing my damage
Because I was chased, thrilled and altered
And it raised me

Suele tener (please)
Me suelto (please)
Me suelto en el deshacer (please, please the place we're in)
Al puro perder el ganar no compara (please, please)
Al puro perder el ganar no compara (please)
