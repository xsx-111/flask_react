Try It On Lyrics
I need the sunlight, to keep me above
These moderations
I always hoped or
Did all this work for
Some peace of mind and just because

On this side, you wanna see that
There's no change, and somewhere to stay
But if you're right
I'll put my keys back
There's no change
And no hand to play

Please explore my love's endurance
And stay, stay
Please enjoy my love's exhortations
No way, no fucking way, no

On this side, you wanna see that
There's no change, and somewhere to stay
On this side, you're gonna see that
There's no change, and nowhere to stay
Try it on
Please try it on, try it on, try it on, try it on
Oh please, please try it on
(Try it on, try it on, try it on)

On this side, you're gonna see that
There's no change, and somewhere to stay
But if you're right, I'll put my keys back
There's no change, and nowhere to stay

There's nowhere to stay, there's nowhere to stay
There's nowhere to stay, nowhere to stay
There's nowhere to stay
There's nowhere to stay2Embed
