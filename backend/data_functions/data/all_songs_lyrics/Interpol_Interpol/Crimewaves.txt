Crimewaves Lyrics
I said I came here with ease
With my porcelain thumb
I can see for me
One day you may just need one
Well you're just becoming self therapeutic
I think it's because we're alone

It's the perfect time to try again
As we slip inside our winter skin
A sweet incline to a beating heart
It's all that there ever is

We crimewaves
Like crimewaves
Crimewaves

Spray my graffiti
From my vintage gallant tongue
Now you see through me
Until the getting is all done
Today we all save some forgiveness
Just for the castaways
I think it's because we're alone
It's the perfect time to try again
As we sleep inside our winter skin
A sweet incline to a beating heart
It's all that there ever is

We crimewaves
Just like crimewaves
Crimewaves

What you need, what you need
What you know me by, what you know me by
That's the way (that you know me by)
That's the way, you will know me by
What you needEmbed
