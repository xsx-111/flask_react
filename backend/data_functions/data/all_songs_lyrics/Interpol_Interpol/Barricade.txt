Barricade Lyrics
I did not take to analysis
So I had to make up my mind
And hold it for awhile
I would not just leave you without a kiss -
But I guess there must come a time
When there's no more tears to cry

Bees and snakes need homes (need homes)
Barricade

It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, to keep us away
And it kinda does
Starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away

I could not lean on the politics
Cause I didn't want to train my eye
To hold so short a time
Also, I just don't know where the blind could lead the sightless
But I still like to witness
Bees and snakes need homes (need homes)
Barricade

It starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, to keep us away
And it kinda does
Starts to feel like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away
(keep us all away)

Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
Return to, past times
Full speed, half blind
(You know us, you know us)
(What we saw was a matter of fiction)
(And I'm sorry)
(And a plan)
(Say I'm sorry)

Sometimes it feels like a barricade
To keep us away, keep us away
And it kinda does
And how much fear can you fabricate to keep us away? (keep us away)
When you know us
Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
We turn to past times
Full speed half blind

Full speed, half blind
Full tilt, decline
On to old times
Full speed half blind3Embed
