Success Lyrics
Dreams of long life
What safety can you find?
See the great unknown
That shade for miles

Good eye
I'm the good guy

Dreams of long life
What safety can you find?
If the sea was that strong
Maybe we had, maybe we had to fly

Was a good try
I'm a good guy

As high as the day
I read the papers
Before crime will pay
I'll learn to bury most beliefs
I have succeeded
I won't compete for long
I'm not supposed to show you
I've got two secrets
But I only told you one

Dreams of long life
What safety can you buy
If the sea was that strong
Maybe we had, maybe we had to fly

Somebody make me say no, no
Somebody make me say no, no (somebody)
Somebody make me say no, no
Somebody make me say no, no, no
Yes

I have succeeded (yeah)
I won't compete for long (yeah)
I'm not supposed to show you (yeah)
I've got two secrets (yeah)
But I only told you one (yeah)
I'm not supposed to show you
I'm not supposed to show you
I'm not supposed to
I'm not supposed to show you
I'm not supposed to2Embed
