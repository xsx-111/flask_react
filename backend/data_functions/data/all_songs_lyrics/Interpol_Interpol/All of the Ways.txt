All of the Ways Lyrics
Tell me you're mine
Baby, tell me you're mine to break the ice
Does he make you smile?
Does he fully embrace the way?
Does he lead you to the fight that you like?
Who is this guy?
(I know the way you will make it up)
(Who is this guy?)

This twee neophyte
Does he know that I wait for all time?
Does he make you right?
Does he say that he'd like to know you?
Does he say that he wants to know?
(Does he say that he wants to know?)

All of the ways you will make it up
Make it up for me
Make it up for me

Tell me you'll fight
Baby, tell me it's hard to fake it time after time
Baby, who is this guy?
(I know the way you will make it up)
Does he say that he'd like to know you?
Does he say that he wants to know?
Does he say that he wants to know?
All of the ways you will make it up
Make it up for me
Make it up for me

All of the ways you will make it up
Make it up for me
Make it up for me
I know the way you will make it up
Make it up for me
I know the way you will make it up
Make it up for me
I know and I know the way you will make it up
Make it up for me
I know and I know the way you will make it up
Make it up for meEmbed
