Falling Inside the Black Lyrics
Tonight I'm so alone
This sorrow takes ahold
Don't leave me here so cold
(Never wanna be so cold)
Your touch used to be so kind
Your touch used to give me life
I've waited all this time
I've wasted so much time

Don't leave me alone
Cause I barely see at all
Don't leave me alone, I'm

Falling in the black
Slipping through the cracks
Falling to the depths, can I ever go back?
Dreaming of the way it used to be
(Can you hear me?)
Falling in the black
Slipping through the cracks
Falling to the depths, can I ever go back?
Falling inside the black
Falling inside, falling inside the black
You were my source of strength
I've traded everything that I love for this one thing
(Stranded in the offering)
Don't leave me here like this
Can't hear me scream from the abyss
And now I wish for you my desire

Don't leave me alone
Cause I barely see at all
Don't leave me alone, I'm

Falling in the black
Slipping through the cracks
Falling to the depths, can I ever go back?
Dreaming of the way it used to be
(Can you hear me?)
Falling in the black
Slipping through the cracks
Falling to the depths, can I ever go back?
Falling inside the black
Falling inside, falling inside, the black
Black, black, black
Falling in the black
Slipping through the cracks
F-f-falling in the black
Slipping through the cracks
Falling through the depths, can I never go back
Dreaming of the way it used to be
(Can you hear me?)
Slipping through the cracks
Falling through the depths, can I never go back
Falling inside the black
(Can you hear me?)
Falling inside the black
(Can you hear me?)
Falling inside the black
(Can you hear me?)
Falling inside, falling inside, falling inside the black5Embed
