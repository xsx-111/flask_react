Looking for Angels Lyrics
Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels

Walk this world alone try to stay on my feet
Sometimes crawl, fall, but I stand up 'cause I'm afraid to sleep
And open my eyes to a new day, with all new problems and all new pain
All the faces are filled with so much anger
Losing our dignity and hope from fear of danger
After all the wars, after settling the scores
At the break of dawn we will be deaf to the answers
There's so much bigotry, misunderstanding and fear
With eyes squinted and fists clenched we reach out for what is dear
(We want it, we want
We want a reason to live)
We're on a pilgrimage
A crusade for hope
Because in our hearts and minds and souls we know
(We need it, we need
We need more than this)

Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels
So many nations with so many hungry people
So many homeless scrounging around for dirty needles
On the rise, teen suicide, when we will realize
We've been desensitized by the lies of the world
We're oppressed and impressed by the greedy
Whose hands squeeze the life out of the needy
When will we learn that wars, threats, and regrets
Are the cause and effect of living in fear
Who can help protect the innocence of our children
Stolen on the internet with images they can't forget
(We want it, we want
We want a reason to live)
We represent a generation that wants to turn back a nation
To let love be our light and salvation
(We need it, we need
We need more than this)

Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels

I became a savior to some kids I'll never meet
Sent a check in the mail to buy them something to eat
What will you do to make a difference, to make a change?
What will you do to help someone along the way?
Just a touch, a smile as you turn the other cheek
Pray for your enemies, humble yourself, love's staring back at me
In the midst of the most painful faces
Angels show up in the strangest of places
Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels
Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels
Going through this life looking for angels
People passing by, looking for angels
Walking down the streets looking for angels
Everyone I meet looking for angels
