Rebirthing Lyrics
I lie here paralytic
Inside this soul
Screaming for you till my throat is numb
I wanna break out, I need a way out
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way
The worst is the waiting
In this womb I'm suffocating

Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen
I take you in
I've died

Rebirthing now
I want to live for love, wanna live for you and me
Breathe for the first time now
I come alive somehow
Rebirthing now
I want to live my life, wanna give you everything
Breathe for the first time now
I come alive somehow
Right now
Right now
I lie here lifeless
In this cocoon
Shedding my skin 'cause
I'm ready to
I want to break out
I found a way out
I don't believe that it's gotta be this way
The worst is the waiting
In this womb I'm suffocating

Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen
I take you in
I've died

Rebirthing now
I want to live for love, wanna live for you and me
Breathe for the first time now
I come alive somehow
Rebirthing now
I want to live my life, wanna give you everything
Breathe for the first time now
I come alive somehow
Tell me when I'm going to live again
Tell me when I'm going to breathe you in
Tell me when I'm going to feel inside
Tell me when I'm going to feel alive
Tell me when I'm going to live again
Tell me when this fear will end
Tell me when I'm going to feel inside
Tell me when I'll feel alive

Rebirthing now
I want to live for love, wanna live for you and me
Breathe for the first time now
I come alive somehow
Rebirthing now
I want to live my life, wanna give you everything
Breathe for the first time now
I come alive somehow

Right now
I come alive somehow
Right now
I come alive somehow8Embed
