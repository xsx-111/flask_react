Only Twin LyricsRun, Tommy, run... did you get all you want?
Did you drink their well dry? And extinguish all their sunshine?
I didn't say that I felt the same, you just took it as read
As I closed all the blinds and put you to bed
And read you all the last rites
It serves as a warning to me, just like most of these days do
'Cause I just wish I could've just left you there sitting in your own shit
'Cause I know that you would me, too
See, cos I've trawled through all this before
And I bought that skinny tee
With a big black gaping hole where the heart should be
That says, "baby, I renounce thee"
Don't you die on me now
That kiss is now a circus show
That big top tent and neon glow
Through spectacles
Of rainbow red
You never feel
Your love 'til it's dead
Yeah
Arm's length keep him
I stab but don't injure
No blood ever poured
Empty as a hole and ever depleting
One and four makes us whole
A bankruptcy of love
Cannot swim above
Empty as a hole and ever depleting
I recoil from the blast
And look around me though
Neither friend nor foe
Empty as a hole and ever depletingEmbed
