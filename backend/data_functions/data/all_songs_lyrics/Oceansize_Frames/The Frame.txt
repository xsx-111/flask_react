The Frame LyricsI can hold you all together
You won't fall
With the troops that we assembled
And the bond we forged
Though this sketch is getting old now
The cracks don't show
Time won't change a thing when I'm gone
Don't grab the wheel too tightly, my son
Everything you need is done, I would've thought you'd won by now
Oh no, no, oh, no, no, no
I have known no other methods
So don't presume there's wisdom
When all that I am is time now
And the cold
Fruition in the detail
Is all that drives me
Time won't change a thing when I'm gone
Don't grab the wheel too tightly, my son
Everything you need is done, I would've thought you'd won by now
Oh no, no, oh, no, no, no
I am not the picture, now I'm...
I am not the picture, now I'm...
I am not the picture, now I'm...
I am not the picture, now I'm...
I'm the frame
I am not the picture, now I'm...
I'm the frame
I am not the picture, now I'm...
I'm the frameEmbed
