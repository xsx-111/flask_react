Sleeping Dogs and Dead Lions LyricsThe slime looks so good on your face
One for charm, one for disgrace
Cunt
And in the back of the truck I'll find the antidote
All the passengers know it's time to jump the boat
Your children will remember every word you say
Never doubt that you're leading them astray
But you're welcome
You're welcome
But he cannot console 'cause he swallowed it whole
The millions will cry at the cut of his schpiel
Paints his words red and kissed with his seal
He thinks that it's real
But he's got it all wrong
You put the fun in dysfunction with a steely shoe
Too long a heaven to stretch on shorter skies of blue
If you could hold your head up and find the sense to say
Only then could laudation come your way
But you're welcome
You're welcome
But he cannot console 'cause he swallowed it whole
The millions will cry at the cut of his schpiel
Paints his words red and kissed with his seal
He thinks that he's wrong
But he's got it all made
But I dealt it in spades
Forgot what I had said
No
Pronounce me dead, longevity, I can still find a way
Find in pages easy, polish and make greasy
Coins in my hand's palm
Unload on him it's easy, wind up and let go
Go, go... go, go, go...
