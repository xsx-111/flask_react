Savant LyricsThe future hates cast asleep but the film remains
This aftertaste, all I wanted is that which I gave
Master slave, I burn fast on sinking ships
And I can talk, I place pride on tick and tock
And its lonely silent until dawn, rites of passage open doors
But Iâ€™m not frightened
Master slave, line and sinker take the bait
Where others float, you and I crash land
Where others float, you and I crash land
Where I see us in far away skies, I could not say
Where I am lost, the darkness falls upon the day
Where I see us in far away skies, I could not say
Where I am lost, the darkness falls upon the day
Where I see us in far away skies, I could not say
Where I am lost, the darkness falls upon the day
Where I see us in far away skies, I could not say
Where I am lost, the darkness falls upon the day
Where I see us in far away skies, I could not say
Where I am lost, the darkness falls upon the day
Where I see us in far away skies, I could not say
Where I am lost, the darkness falls upon the dayEmbed
