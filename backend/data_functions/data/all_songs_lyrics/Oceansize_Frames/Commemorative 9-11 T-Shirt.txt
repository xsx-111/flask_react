Commemorative 9/11 T-Shirt LyricsYou try to keep your composure
I'm only having a laugh
The latest attempt at closure
Failed after 25 drafts
But I can still retain this
I can still collect
You're cashing in on misery
And calling in all your debts
Stop trying to keep your composure
I'm only having a laugh
The latest attempt at closure
Failed after 25 drafts
But I still can still retain this
I can still retain this
I can still retain this
Stop trying to keep your composure
Stop trying to keep your composure
Stop trying to keep your composure
Stop trying to keep your composure
And it comes as no surprise you never let go
And it comes as no surprise you never let go
And it comes as no surprise you never let go
And it comes as no surprise you never let goEmbed
