Unfamiliar LyricsDuring the laceration
All you wanna do is cry
But at last that realization
How quickly fresh blood dries
Needs little explanation
It's gonna take a lot of time
Ideas above our station
Are below the fog in my mind
When I see, I see my signs
And it's the same face presenting the same lie
If you keep walking sideways
If you keep changing your mind
It's the same face presenting the same lie
If you keep walking sideways
If you keep changing your mind
When I see, I see my signs
When I see, I see my signs
Obsolete your voices are
Obsolete your voices are
Obsolete your voices are
Obsolete your voices are
They say, silence it sometimes pays
In war, silence it sometimes pays
They say, silence it sometimes pays
In war, silence it sometimes pays
Souls and windows stops existing
And holes where his eyes used to be
Needle and thread hold together
His love for the dead and all who sail in her
Saw the seashore, unfamiliar
The water and oil, unfamiliar
Success and toil, unfamiliar
Unaccustomed, unfamiliar1Embed
