In My Dreams LyricsMy love is always just as she seems
A force of nature all her own
To be reckoned with
Whatever's wrong with me
Her kiss redeems
And it's all there in my dreams
In my dreams
My love is soaring
She glides through the sky
Hardly a warning she takes my hand
Says, "Open your eyes."
We look down on the earth
And all its schemes
We laugh and it's all there in my dreams
In my dreams
We swoop down below the clouds
Destination unknown
And then she says, "Let's go home."
My love is resting under a tree
She whispers softly in my ear
As she lay next to me
"That was the funnest day."
Her sad eyes beam
And it's all there in my dreams
In my dreamsEmbed
