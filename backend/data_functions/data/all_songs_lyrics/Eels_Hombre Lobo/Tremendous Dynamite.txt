Tremendous Dynamite LyricsOoh, uh
I am el hombre lobo
On the prowl for a restless night
I got her right here in my sights
Got a fuse that I can light
She's tremendous
She's dynamite
She is a formidable opponent
She could put up a hard won fight
Got her head screwed on real tight
Being the bomb is her birthright
She's tremendous
She's dynamite
She's tremendous dynamite
I am el hombre lobo
On the prowl just past midnight
Darting under the town searchlights
It's all worth it to take a bite
She's tremendous
She's dynamiteEmbed
