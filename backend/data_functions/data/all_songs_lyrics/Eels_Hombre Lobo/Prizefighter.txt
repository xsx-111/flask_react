Prizefighter LyricsOoh
Well if you need me I'm right here
No matter what, I'm always near
Yeah, I've been through a lot and you can't scare me
Now go on baby if you just dare me
I'll break through any wall
Just give me a call
I'm a dynamiter
I'm a prizefighter
Well if you get sad, I'm your friend
I got an ear I'll always lend
You know that you can always talk to me
Now come on baby take a walk with me
Tell me all, tell daddy all
Just give me a call
I'm a go all nighter
I'm a prizefighter
Hey, hey, hey
Ha-ooh, ha-ooh, hey
Well when you're down and all alone
There's always somewhere you can go
Here I am, a true friend
There's nothing gonna change over here on my end
Don't be scared, it's better shared
You know I've always cared
I'm a everything's all righter
I'm a prizefighter
Well if you need me I'm right here
No matter what I'm always near
Yeah I've been through a lot and you can't scare me
Now go on baby if you just dare me
I'll win your heart, now let it start
Let it start
I'm a don't do it wrong - do it righter
