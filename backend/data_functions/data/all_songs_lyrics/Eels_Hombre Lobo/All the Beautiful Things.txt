All the Beautiful Things LyricsEveryday I wake up and wonder why
I'm alone when I know I'm a lovely guy
Birds come down from skies so blue
See all the beautiful things you do
Why can't I just get with you?
Every night I carry out my plan
Pray to God that one day I could be your man
Birds come down from skies so blue
See all the beautiful things you do
Why can't I just get with
You'd be my only friend in the world
Or you could just be my girl
And if I do run away from this life
There won't be much for me in the afterlife
Although I know that you don't even care
I'd rather stay in a world where
Birds come down from skies so blue
See all the beautiful things you do
Why can't I just get with you?
