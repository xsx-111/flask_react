The Longing LyricsThe longing is a pain
A heavy pressure on my chest
It rarely leaves
My day becomes a quest
To try not to think about her
And all that she brings
Forget about her magic
All the beautiful things
Surely there are other things to life
But I can't think of one single thing
That matters more than just to see her
Just to see her
Her smile
Her touch
Her smell
Her laugh
The longing is a friend
A way to stay close
And feel like she's here
And feel like she knows
That when I say I would die for her
It's not just words, I really would
And to make the world a safer place for her
Well, I believe I really could
Surely there are other things to life
But I can't think of one single thing
That matters more than just to see her
To see her
Her tears
Her sorrow
Her faults
Her doubts
I love them allEmbed
