That Look You Give that Guy LyricsI never thought that I could be so bold
To even say these thoughts aloud
I see you with your man
Your eyes just shine
While he stands tall
And walking proud

That look you give that guy
I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy
Instead of me
I'd never let you down
It always seems like you're going somewhere
Better than you've been before
While I go to sleep and I dream all night
Of you knocking at my door

That look you give that guy
I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy
Instead of me
I'd be all I can be
I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
I'm nothing much I know it's true
I lack the style and the pedigree
And my chances are so few

That look you give that guy
I wanna see
Looking right at me
If I could be that guy
Instead of me
I'd give you all I got
I never thought that I could be so bold
To even say these thoughts aloud
But it, let's say, it won't work out
You know where I can be found
