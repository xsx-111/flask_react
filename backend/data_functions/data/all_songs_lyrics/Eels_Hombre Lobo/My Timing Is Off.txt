My Timing Is Off LyricsMy timing is off
She isn't ready for my love
It's all that I've got
But it's a pretty big thing
That she should recognize
The truth between us cannot hide
She knows that it's real
But the situation doesn't fit
I know what I feel
And I know that this is really it
The thing it's all about
And I don't have a single doubt
My timing is off
But sometimes that's how it all works
Believe it or not
We don't have a choice in matters of the heart
Just gotta be brave enough
To love and let yourself be loved
My timing is off
But I'm not worried about a thing
She knows that it's real
She couldn't throw it all away
For fear of happiness
This isn't like that other messEmbed
