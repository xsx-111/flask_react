Ordinary Man LyricsWell it's another warm day
In the city of cold hearts
They all just play the part
Of who they are
And I'm here on my own
I'd rather be alone
Than try to be someone that I'm not
And you seem like someone
Who could appreciate the fact
That I'm no ordinary man
And it's misunderstood
What you've heard about me
I see why you would doubt me
But know this
No one has a right
Until they've fought my fight
To understand just where I'm coming from
And it's that fight that brought me here today
Exactly as I am
No ordinary man
Well it's another warm day
In the city of cold hearts
It ends before it starts
In their maze
But you, you're not like that
You know where it's at
The only rules you follow are your own
And you seem like someone
Who could appreciate the fact
That I'm no ordinary manEmbed
