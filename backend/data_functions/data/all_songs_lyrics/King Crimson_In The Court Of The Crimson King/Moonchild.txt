Moonchild Lyrics

Call her moonchild
Dancing in the shallows of a river
Lonely moonchild
Dreaming in the shadows of a willow

Talking to the trees of the cobweb strange
Sleeping on the steps of a fountain
Waving silver wands to the night-bird's song
Waiting for the sun on the mountain

She's a moonchild
Gathering the flowers in a garden
Lovely moonchild
Drifting in the echoes of the hours

Sailing on the wind in a milk white gown
Dropping circle stones on a sun dial
Playing hide and seek with the ghosts of dawn
Waiting for a smile from a sun child
