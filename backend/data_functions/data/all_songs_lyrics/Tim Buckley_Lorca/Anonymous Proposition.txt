Anonymous Proposition LyricsLove me, as if someday you'd hate me
For what I give is yours without a name
To fill your night long needs
Only as long as you say
This time you'll learn that love is just a slave
To where the heart beats stronger
This time you'd need in turn or promise forever
I could have been a boy from long ago you've left forgotten
And lately you've wondered where he's gone
Oh, it's never hold to me not as long as love lives in this house
Take me, after all you've lost and never wanted
Somewhere between all the nights you've tasted wine of men forever
Until they left you to wake alone
Aw, but it's never said to me
Not when the years live in these hours
And darling love me as if someday you'd hate me
For what I am is here in front of you longing to know
How long you'd care for me
This time you'll learn that love is just a slave
To where your heart beats stronger
That's where you stayEmbed
