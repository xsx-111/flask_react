I Had A Talk With My Woman LyricsI had a talk with my woman late last night
And she reassured me everything was alright
And time hung still like a falling rain
Now I know at last that my love is safe
Ah but when I go away my love I leave
Lord I'm but half a man without her by my side
She's this memory that I hold all around
She's this dream that I always hold to believe
I wanna go upon a mountain
And sing my love and sing my love
I wanna sing it high, sing it down low
Then I'm gonna know how long it's gonna last
Then I'm gonna know how long it's gonna last
Well you know your Moses, oh lord he lost his way
Ah, and your Jesus don't remember the words
Well then I guess it's just you and me brother
All alone in this cold world
All alone in this cold world
Ah, you gotta go upon a mountain
And learn to sing your love, learn to sing your love
You know I can sing it high, sing it down low
Then we gonna know how long it's gonna last
Then we gonna know how long it's gonna last
Hard rain, sweet rain, fall a little while longer
Wash down the city skies
Lord bring the streets alive
Make it like it was, long before I was born1Embed
