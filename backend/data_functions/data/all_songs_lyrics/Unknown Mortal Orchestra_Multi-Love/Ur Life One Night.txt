Ur Life One Night Lyrics
If she’d fallen in love, first blood, you didn’t notice
It’s not love, it’s a close call
You poor thing, you’ve got to stop calling it love
You’ve got to be ignorin' the first girl
She’s so clever, she said

She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night

She wants you, and love don’t come into the equation
What she loves is sex in parked cars and the Photo Booth at Cha Cha
She’s not a hologram, got damn, you can’t ignore it
She’s such fun, she says “Don’t run," she said

She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night

You’re cornered, and she just needs revolution
That’s cute, but she’s no pearl of Gisborne
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night
She could be the love of your life
Just for one night1Embed
