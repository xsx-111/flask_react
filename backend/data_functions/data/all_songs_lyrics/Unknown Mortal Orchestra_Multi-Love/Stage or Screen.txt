Stage or Screen Lyrics
Actor, but never for stage or screen
In a cauldron of crime
Did she want him or want to be him?
And did she smoke a cigarette in the dark?

Actor, but never for stage or screen
Acting like you’ve never seen

Every cell of hers more alive
And bright than mine
Did she want me or want to be me?
And did she smoke a cigarette in the dark?

Actor, but never for stage or screen
Acting like you’ve never seen

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Actor, but never for stage or screen
Acting like you’ve never seen


Actor, but never for stage or screen
Acting like you’ve never seen1Embed
