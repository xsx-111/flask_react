The World Is Crowded Lyrics
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?

She made me buy her a chameleon
With each eye on a different sun
She made me watch Evangelion
In another life, did she blow my brains out?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?
She found me in Robot Restaurant
Now Iâ€™ll give her whatever she want
Would she listen to a recording of my silly voice
On the last day of her life?

Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me, baba?
Woo, the world is crowded
Woo-oo, did your doctor prescribe me for what ails you, dear?5Embed
