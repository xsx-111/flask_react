Puzzles Lyrics
America, open up your door
Is it right to always fight against “the other?"
And what is a “person of color?"
Is it wrong to have zone that isn’t monochrome?
Einstein’s brain is kept at Princeton University
Please don’t ask it questions

I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore

America, open up your door
Is it right to always fight against “the other?"
And what is a “person of color?"
Is it wrong to have zone that isn’t monochrome?
Einstein’s brain is kept at Princeton University
Please don’t ask it questions

I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymore
I don’t want to solve your puzzles anymoreEmbed
