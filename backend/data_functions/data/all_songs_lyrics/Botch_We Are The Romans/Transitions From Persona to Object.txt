Transitions From Persona to Object LyricsWide eyes help you stand out and the fact that you bare all skin
Silhouettes keep me thinking about the habits you are in
Watch us blanket all things and solidify all claims
Hopes, dreams, we're here to make ourselves better
Time to build
Our colony
There's no stopping it now
Conquest is at hand
And the thirst for more
And the need for more
Go on
Never satisfied
Never satisfied
Never dormant
We
Go on
See us
Conquer all the
Humans that are left
This is our new home
This is our new home
This is our new home
This is our new home
Our new home
And we're still building
Still building
We're still building
And we're still building1Embed
