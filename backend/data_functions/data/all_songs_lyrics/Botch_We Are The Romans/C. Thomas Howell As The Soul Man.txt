C. Thomas Howell As The Soul Man LyricsStop the show, listen up
We've got something to say and it's important
Can't hear the words you say, or the notes you play
And you're not changing the world
Just a few more moments of your time
Just a few more moments, while I speak
So we can change your mind
We're all breaking ground
Bringing the revolution around
Bringing the revolution around
Wasting our time, wasting our time
Wasting our time, wasting our time
Wasting our time, wasting our time
Wasting our time, wasting our time
Support this, support that
Once again, it's all an act
Support this, support that
Once again, it's all an act
The worst music I've ever heard
Honesty that touches a nerve
The words fall onto the floor
Drive home with no lessons learned
Soon the content outweighs the form
With time, the sounds get boring
For you and me, this posture is self-servingEmbed
