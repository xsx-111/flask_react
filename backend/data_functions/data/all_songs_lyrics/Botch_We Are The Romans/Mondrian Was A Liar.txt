Mondrian Was A Liar LyricsWhite eyes in coal mines
Concrete industry
Bare backs, baseball caps
The sweat is part of life
We're still thriving
We've got a lot of mouths to feed
And we're trying
You think I do this for me
Join the caste
Flip through old photographs
Of our family's past
Building your home
Giving your life
Our livelihood
It's always been
Like this, always been
Like this, always been
Like this, always been
Like this, always been
Like this, always been
Like this, always been (Creators)
Like this, always been
People you never see, the ones you'll never be
Working with their hands, we've downsized again
All through history, building piece by piece
It's not for you to erase
With your algebra
And your science
Simple labor
Simple labor
White eyes
In coal minesEmbed
