Frequency Ass Bandit LyricsAnchored (Wringing) awake (my hands)
Anchored (Weighing) awake (my time)
Anchored (Running) awake (down dreams)
Anchored (Buying) awake (your life)
Patience is a girl I've been trying to
Forget about, to forget about
Always rearing her ugly head
When I'm choosing, choosing, she's losing, losing
She's the one who still sits alone
Her comforting smile
Saves me
From making
The same mistake
Drag it out of me
Take what you've got, make it better
Take what you've got, it could always be better
I feel the loss, I bear my own cross
Enjoying the last
Seconds we have
My unseen dictator
Grasps throats with both hands
With both hands
It brings about euthanasia
It brings about euthanasia
Who holds my fate in their hands?
Who holds my fate in their hands?
Who holds my fate in their hands?
Who holds my fate in their hands?
Who holds my fate in their hands?
Who holds my fate in their hands?
Who holds my fate in their hands?
Who holds my fate?
Not you
Not you
