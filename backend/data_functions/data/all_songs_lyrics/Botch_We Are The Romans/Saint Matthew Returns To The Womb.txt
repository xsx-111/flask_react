Saint Matthew Returns To The Womb LyricsOn the porch, two words changed life for me
And I'm not the same
He said, "Son, soon your life will change"
And I believed in him
"Your soul will be free of the pain"
"In time you'll know that it's true"
The hand of God will pick me up
"So pledge your loyalty"
So I fall to you
False eyes
Forked words
I'm ten
Now that I see you're just a man
Recruiting your followers
And this was not won by your hand
Questions and contradictions
It's like I'm following the rabbit around the track again
Around and around
And you're so sure
Two words
The changes I've endured
And I know it is all shitEmbed
