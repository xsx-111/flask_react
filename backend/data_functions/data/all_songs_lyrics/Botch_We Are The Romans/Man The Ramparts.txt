Man The Ramparts LyricsWe'll man, we'll man
We'll man, we'll man
We'll man the ramparts
With arrows ready
With arrows ready
With arrows ready
With our flags up
With our flags up
We'll man, we'll man
We'll man the ramparts

We are, we are
We are, we are

We are the Romans
We are the Romans
We are the Romans
We are the Romans
