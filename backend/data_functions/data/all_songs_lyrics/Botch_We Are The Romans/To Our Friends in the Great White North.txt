To Our Friends in the Great White North LyricsSet apart
Great divides
You are not what you seem
Always different, always changing
It brings the worst out of me
And it's here to stay
And that's the way it's been
The way it's always been for men
Always on your attire, silences what you think
And now you're wearing, and now you're wearing eyeliner
So lie
Now see how
How you look in the light, not so different
Not so different
It's hard for you to swallow
(Gone) Don't change a single thing
(Gone) At least not for me
(Gone) Just keep on acting
(Gone)
It's maddening
Its flashbulb thoughts, it's contrasting
(Gone)
(Gone) Can't decide who you are
(Gone) No feelings plagues my head
(Gone) We'll all be specimens
It's your fault, fucking up the kids
It's your fault, fucking up the kids
It's your fault, fucking up the kids
It's your fault, fucking up the kids
It's your fault, fucking up the kids
It's your fault, fucking up the kids
Complaints have all been heard
And we're tired, and we're
Bringing out the dead
So where's the first you that I knew beforeEmbed
