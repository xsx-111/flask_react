The Fixer Lyrics
When something's dark, let me shed a little light on it
When something's cold, let me put a little fire on it
If something's old, I wanna put a bit of shine on it
When something's gone, I wanna fight to get it back again

Yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah

When something's broke, I wanna put a bit of fixing on it
When something's bored, I wanna put a little exciting on it
If something's low, I wanna put a little high on it
When something's lost, I wanna fight to get it back again

Yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah

When signals cross, I wanna put a little straight on it
If there's no love, I wanna try to love again

I’ll say your prayers, I’ll take your side
I'll find us a way to make light
I'll dig your grave, we'll dance and sing
What's saved could be one last lifetime
Yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah, fight to get it back again
Yeah1Embed
