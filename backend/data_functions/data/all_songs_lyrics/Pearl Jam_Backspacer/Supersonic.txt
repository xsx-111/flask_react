Supersonic Lyrics
Yeah

Yeah, I been dreaming of getting along
Now I'm awake, dreaming keep it on keeping on
I catch a break, then a punch to the head
I smile big with a toothless grin, yeah

Supersonic gone and took my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yeh
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live, but I'll never let you go

Yeah

Yeh I been thinking, I already know
Nothing 'bout nothing or so I have been told, yeh
I'm not the paper, I'm more like the fold
Cut the crease and put the shit in the whole, yeah

Supersonic gone and took my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yeh
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live, but I'll never let you go
Supersonic, gotta feel it now
I need to hear, need to feel it loud yeh
Supersonic, truth be told
I wanna live my life with the volume full

Supersonic gone and took my soul
I caught the rhythm but the clock was slow yeh
Supersonic, truth be told
I don't need you to live, but I'll never let you go

Supersonic, gotta feel it now
I need to hear, need to feel it loud yeh
Supersonic, truth be told
I wanna live my life with the volume full1Embed
