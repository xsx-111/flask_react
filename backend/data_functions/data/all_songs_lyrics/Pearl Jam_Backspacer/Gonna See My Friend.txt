Gonna See My Friend Lyrics
Do you want to hear something sad?
We are but victims of desire
I'm going to shake this day
I want to shake this day before I retire

I'm going to see my friend
I'm going to see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm going to see my friend, make it go away

Well I said I... I won't be long before we all walk off the wire
Well I'm going to see my friend, I'm gonna see my friend for what I require
Well I said I will come in quick
Don't want my flame to get no higher

I'm going to see my friend
I'm going to see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm going to see my friend, make it go away

Want to leave it all
Want to give it up
Want to see it go once and for all
Want to view it cho
Want a little bit home
Want to be there
Hard as a statue, black as a tattoo, never to wash away
Going to take me an astral plane
I'm going to tunnel through denial
But I'm going to shake this day
I want to shake this day before I retire

I'm going to see my friend
I'm going to see my friend, make it go away
I'm sick of everything
I'm going to see my friend, make it go away2Embed
