Got Some Lyrics
Every night with the lights out
Where you gone? What's wrong?
Every time, you can try but can't turn on
A rock song

I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it

Get it now, get it on before it's gone
Let's everybody carry on, carry on
Get it now, Set it off before it's gone
Again, everybody carry on, carrying on

Precipitation, which side are you on?
Are you on the rise? Are you falling down?
Let me know
Come on let's go yeah

I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
Get it now, get it on before it's gone
Let's everybody carry on, carry on
Get it now, Set it off before it's gone
Again, everybody carry on, carrying on

This situation, which side are you on?
Are you getting out?
Are you dropping bombs?
Have you heard of diplomatic resolve, yeah?

Precipitation, which side are you on?
Are you on the rise? Are you falling down?
Let me know
Come on let's go yeah

I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it

Get it now, get it on before it's gone
Let's everybody carry on, carry on
Get it now, Set it off before it's gone
Again, everybody carry on, carrying on
This situation, which side are you on?
Are you getting out?
Are you dropping bombs?
Have you heard of diplomatic resolve, yeah?

Precipitation, which side are you on?
Are you on the rise? Are you falling down?
Let me know
Come on let's go yeah

I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it
I got some if you need it1Embed
