Force of Nature Lyrics
Understand She's a Force of Nature
Contraband hiding deep inside her soul
Exercising her will to lose control
She lets go
Common Man he don't stand a chance no
Wonderland pulling Alice in the hole
No way to save someone who won't take the rope
And just let's go

One Man Stands the edge of the ocean
A beacon on dry land
Eyes upon the horizon
In the dark before the dawn

Hurricane has the trade winds blowing
Gale force shaking windows in the storm
Shipwreck from a love that he calls home
One light on

Somewhere there's a siren singing
A song only he hears
All the strengths you might think would
Disappear resolving
One man stands alone awaiting for her to come home
Eyes upon the horizon
In the dark before the
Darkness leaves the dawn
Makes me ache
Makes me shake
Is it so wrong to think that
Love can keep us safe?

Last I saw he was out there waiting
A silhouette in the black light full moon glow
In the sand there he stands upon the shore
Forevermore

Somewhere there's a siren singing
A song only he hears
All the strengths you might think would
Disappear resolving
One man stands alone awaiting for her to come home
Eyes upon the horizon
In the dark before the
Darkness leaves the dawnEmbed
