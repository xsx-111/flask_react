Horseshoe Crabs Lyrics
Hey, did you hear me, mom?
Baby's headed home
Against your wishes, I went
Into the woods, alone
Just look at my face, a vegetable, beet red
I know you gave me money for the motel
But I came here instead- I came here instead

What I wanted when I left you
Brushed by, so close
With the money, I got pretty gone
And bloodied some poor actor's nose

One night in the park, the pellet gun
Took out an eye, I came undone

One college kid came to see me
He passed me that nylon string
Asked me to play him something
So I tried my hand at "Blues Run the Game"
I barely made it through it
Then he had to go back to his parent's house upstate
Upstate...
Woke from the dream and I was old
Staring at the ass crack of dawn
Walked these streets up and down
Looking for Paul Simon

All I found was myself, lost in time
I tried singing my songs
But I lost my mind

What have they done with my jealous one?
Who is gonna talk trash long after I'm gone?
When I was young, they used to find me
Pitching horseshoe crabs back into the Sound

What have they done, what have they done
With my jealous one? With my jealous one?
When I was young, they used to find me
Pitching horseshoe crabs back into the Sound4Embed
