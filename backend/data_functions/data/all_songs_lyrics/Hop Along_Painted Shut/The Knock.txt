The Knock Lyrics
8:45 A.M, the dream just escaped me again
Over breakfast I could hear you in the garage, building insects
I know that knock- come on, I just put on the coffee
I know that knock- they wanna come inside and speak with me

At the door came the knock of
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you

Did you see the look on the face of the kid he brought with him?
I never once seen a teenager look so radiant
You said, "Why did you get so sentimental over them?"
I wasn't, it's just, it's been a long time since I was moved to crying

At the door came the knock of
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witnesses just want to talk to you
And in the car you said, "Everyone is suffering."

At the door came the knock of
At the door came the knock of
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you
The witness just wants to talk to you1Embed
