I Saw My Twin Lyrics
I saw my twin working in a Waffle House
The first birds of morning cackled from the graveyard
In walked the entourage
Big silver bus in the mountains
Her full hands leapt like fleas on a dog
Belonging without alternative

The waitress jumped over the table
And begged, "Can I take your picture?"

West Virginia, this is how it's done
You take the money and you just run

Try not to look at the look on the nun in the corner booth
It invites nobody in
It's a great black hole of providence
Please take pity upon the heart that lives in me
I have to turn away now
I can't stand watching old ladies eat

The waitress gazes over our table
Big silver bus is long gone
West Virginia, this is how it's done
Sir, could you be a little more gentle?
Unprofitable servant!
Pennsylvania, the 6 A.M. cold sun
Leaves me waiting on the thread of someone
The thread of someoneEmbed
