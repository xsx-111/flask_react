Well-dressed Lyrics
Well-dressed, but walking in the wrong direction
Louisiana, my disordered road always led straight back into you
"Ha ha ha," goes the train
I wanted to leave but here I am again, Louisiana!
I don't remember
I don't remember ever shaking hands with you-know-who

When I was alive, I lived despite the law
Now the law has buried me many, many times
Itâ€™s built a freeway all around my bed
I saw it once open its great mouth wide
But it was so full of afflicted houses and buildings
I can't remember what it was saying

Well-dressed
Well, some of us are, that is
The ones who know how, that is
Some of us are, that is
The ones who know how, that is, that is, that is, that is

I read about you and came home to find my mother
Staring deep into the dark, dark web
She started begging me
Not to give my social security number to anybody else
There goes the sound of the freeway
"Ha ha ha ha ha," goes the train
"Ha ha ha ha ha," goes the train
Well-dressed, but walking, I
Walking, I
I don't wanna go back, no, no6Embed
