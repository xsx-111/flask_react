Powerful Man Lyrics
Sun setting on the street
Your dad told you not to look at me
Down came the fist hard upon your head
I was the only other adult around
I was the only other adult around
I was 18, you were 8, maybe you were 10

He said, "She's not gonna help you."
He said, "She's not..."

I just thought he looked like a powerful man
I just thought he looked like a powerful man

My good friend convinced me to turn around
My good friend says, "I think I saw a light on."
We walked through the dead halls
Looking for teachers and we found one
But she didn't look too happy to see us
She didn't look too happy to see us
"How should I know?" she said
"That man you just described could be anyone."
He said, "She's not gonna help you."
He said, "She's not..."

I just thought he looked like a powerful man
I just thought he looked like a powerful man

I just thought he looked like a powerful man
I just thought he looked like a powerful man

I just thought he looked like a powerful man
I just thought he looked like a powerful...
Looked like a powerful...
Looked like a powerful...
Looked like a powerful manEmbed
