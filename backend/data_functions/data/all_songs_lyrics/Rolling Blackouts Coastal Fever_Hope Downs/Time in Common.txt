Time in Common Lyrics
Before the start, time at separate tables
Time in common
And with your friends, sitting in the wings
Time in common
Smiling politely, I was standing in the backyard
I didn't have another place to go
Time in a vacuum, two-hundred waking hours

Oh yeah, do you ever think about it?
Do you feel it all that much?
Do you really think it matters?

Beside the water, your legs were next to mine
Time in common (Time in common, time in common)
On the couches at other people's houses
Time in common (Time in common, time in common)
Outside the hall, words in the right order
I said it back, you said it back
Brand new union, a mutual life assured
Time in common

Oh yeah, do you ever think about it?
Do you feel it all that much?
Do you really think it matters?
I tell you, I do
Pale blue dots suspended in the sky
Elastic time inside a flying can
By the columns at sunset
The birds were rising and falling and rising
Then on the platform, through the window of the train
Time in commonEmbed
