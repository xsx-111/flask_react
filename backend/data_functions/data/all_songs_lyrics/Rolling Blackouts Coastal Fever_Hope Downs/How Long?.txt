How Long? Lyrics
I can see it in your face
I can hear it in your voice
I know you're not here for good fun
How long have you been on the run?

What are you running, what are you running from?
What are you running, what are you running from?
What are you running, what are you running from?

I'm running into you
I've been running into you

What are you running, what are you running from?
What are you running, what are you running from?

How long?
How long?


How long?
How long?
How long?Embed
