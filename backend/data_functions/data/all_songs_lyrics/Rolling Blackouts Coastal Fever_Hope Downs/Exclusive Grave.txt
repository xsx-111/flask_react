Exclusive Grave Lyrics
Awaken on the satin sheets
Another velvet morning
Gaze down at the stinking streets
Black glass reflects a warning
The losing team are in their place
The fat of the land is your right
You put it all into your face
The only one in sight

Your tongue moves like a shining sword
In your suit of armour, powder blue
You're running with the wild ones
And the boys always get up to no good
It's different when they're not around
Long lunches go down slowly
With no one to massage your neck
The black cloud descends

You watch yourself on the news, don't let the feeling die
You watch yourself on the news, phone rings
Take the ticket
Take the ticket
Here's to you, looking at you
Looking at you, looking at you

You watch yourself on the news, don't let the feeling die
You watch yourself on the news, phone rings
Take the ticket
Take the ticket

Past the stone gate, corridor winds
Velvet carpet draped under shining candlelight
Oil portraits hang, enter the mahogany room
Behind the black rope lies the golden box
Now you're going home, now you're going homeEmbed
