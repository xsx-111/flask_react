Talking Straight Lyrics
All day, I listen out for Jenny's old coup√©
Midnight blue, it's faded, but she's always been true
Holiday, haven't seen you since, you had to get away
Window pane, electricity illuminates the rain

Lean your face, hopeless, no embrace
I wanna know
I wanna know where the silence comes from
Where space originates

Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight
I'm right, this is sin
You're not talking straight
Come around, give in
You're not talking straight
Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight

On closer inspection, it's just a reflection
And I still move with feeling inside
And it's the tyranny of questioning
Ring the diving bell
I'm further down, I'm nearly out
I'm deeper down the well
I'm hopeless, no embrace
I wanna know
I wanna know where the silence comes from
Where space originates

Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight
I'm right, this is sin
You're not talking straight
Come around, give in
You're not talking straight
Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight


Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straight
I'm right, this is sin
You're not talking straight
Come around, give in
You're not talking straight
Lay back, sink in
You're not talking straightEmbed
