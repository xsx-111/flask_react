Pre-Road Downs (Live) LyricsI have kissed you
So I'll miss you
On the road I'll be wantin' you
But I have you 'cause I love you
And you have me 'cause you love me too. Yeah
Felt forsaken, you'll awaken
To the joys of livin' hand in glove
And then I will lend you my will
And your days will be filled with love
Don't run the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roaches
Felt rejected, as expected
You rejected all the thoughts of words
So I'll pray with you
To stay with me forever, and we'll make it work
Elevated, you're elated
'Cause I've waited a year for you
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
Then I'm gonna make my love to you
Don't run the time approaches
Hotels and midnight coaches
Be sure to hide the roachesEmbed
