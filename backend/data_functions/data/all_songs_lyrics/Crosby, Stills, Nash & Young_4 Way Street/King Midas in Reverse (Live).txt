King Midas in Reverse (Live) LyricsIf you could only see me
And know exactly who I am
You wouldn't want to be me
Oh I can assure you of that
I'm not the guy to run with
'Cause I'll throw you off the line
I'll break you and destroy you
Given time
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
It's plain to see it's hopeless
Going on that way we are
So even though I lose you
You'd be better of by far
He's not the one to hold your trust
Everything around him turns to dust in his hand
Nothing he can do is right
He'd even like to sleep at night
But he can't
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
I wish someone would find me
And help me gain control
Before I lose my reason and my soul
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverse
He's King Midas with a curse
He's King Midas in reverseEmbed
