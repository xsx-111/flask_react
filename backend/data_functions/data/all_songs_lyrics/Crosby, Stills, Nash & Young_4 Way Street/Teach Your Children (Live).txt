Teach Your Children (Live) LyricsYou who are on the road
Must have a code that you can live by
And so become yourself
Because the past is just a goodbye
Teach your children well
Their father's health did slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked, the one you'll know by
Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them back inside
And know they love you
And you of tender years
Can't know the fears that your elders grew by
And so please help them with your youth
They seek the truth before they can die
Teach your parents well
Their children's health will slowly go by
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked, the one you'll know by
Don't you ever ask them why
If they told you, you would cry
So just look at them back inside
And know they love youEmbed
