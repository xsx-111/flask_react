Laughing (Live) LyricsI thought I met a man
Who said he knew a man
Who knew what was going on
I was mistaken
Only another stranger that I knew
I thought I found a light
And all this darkness
I was mistaken
Only reflections of a shadow that I saw
And I thought I'd seen someone
Who seemed at last
To know the truth
I was mistaken
It was only a child laughing in the sun
Ah! In the sunEmbed
