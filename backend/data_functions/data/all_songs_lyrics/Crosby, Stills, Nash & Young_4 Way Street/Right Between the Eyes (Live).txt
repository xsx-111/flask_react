Right Between the Eyes (Live) LyricsMy head is hanging heavy with the thoughts of him in mind
'Tis sacrilege for us to take advantage of the blind
So, tell before you come to me from out of yonder skies
A man's a man who looks a man right between the eyes
And the pain that we can bring to him
I don't think he could beat
Please don't ask me how I know
I've just been up that street
And all the people living there
Have been silenced by their own lies
A man's a man who looks a man right between the eyes
And talking' from experience I know how he would feel
Waking up and finding that his one love wasn't real
But the age of truth will soon appear, Aquarius arrives
A man's a man who looks a man right between the eyesEmbed
