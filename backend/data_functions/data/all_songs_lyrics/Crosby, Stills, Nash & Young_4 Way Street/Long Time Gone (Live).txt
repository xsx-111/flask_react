Long Time Gone (Live) LyricsIt's been a long time comin'
It's goin' to be a long time gone
And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Time, yes, a long, long, long, long time
Before the dawn
Turn, turn any corner
Hear, you must hear what the people say
You know there's something that's going on around here
It surely, surely, surely won't stand the light of day, no
And it appears to be a long (Yes, it does)
Appears to be a long (Mmm)
Appears to be a long
Time, such a long, long time
Before the dawn
Speak out, you got to speak out against the madness
You got to speak your mind if you dare
But don't, no don't, no, try to get yourself elected
If you do, you had better cut your hair, mmm
And it appears to be a long (Yes, it does)
Appears to be a long (Mmmhmm)
Appears to be a long
Time, such a long, long, long, long time
Before the dawn, yeah
It's been a long time comin'
It's goin' to be a long time gone
But you know
The darkest hour
Is always, always just before the dawn
And it appears to be a long
Appears to be a long
Appears to be a long time, such a long, long, long, long time
Before the dawnEmbed
