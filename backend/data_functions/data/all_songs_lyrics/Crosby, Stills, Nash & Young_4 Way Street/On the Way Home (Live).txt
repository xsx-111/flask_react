On the Way Home (Live) Lyrics
When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane
Like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me and I miss you now

In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came
And you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you (I love you, I do)
Can you feel it now?

Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you (I love you, I do)
Can you feel it now? (Feel it now)
Can you feel it now? (Can you feel it now?)
Can you feel it now? (Can you feel it now?)
Can you?Embed
