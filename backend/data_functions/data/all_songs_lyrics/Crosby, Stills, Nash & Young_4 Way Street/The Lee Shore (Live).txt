The Lee Shore (Live) LyricsWheel gull spin and glide
You've got no place to hide
'Cause you don't need one
All along the lee shore
Shells lie scattered in the sand
Winking up like shining eyes, at me
From the sea
Here is one like sunrise
It's older than you know
It's still lying there where
Some careless wave
Forgot it long ago
When I awoke this morning
I dove beneath my floating home
Down below her graceful side
In the turning tide
To watch the sea fish roam
There I heard a story
From the sailors of the Sandra Marie
There's another island a
Day's run away from here
And it's empty and free
From here to Venezuela
There's nothing more to see
Than a hundred thousand islands
Flung like jewels upon the sea
For you and me
Sunset smells of dinner
Women are calling at me to end my tails
But perhaps I'll see you
The next quiet place
I furl my sailsEmbed
