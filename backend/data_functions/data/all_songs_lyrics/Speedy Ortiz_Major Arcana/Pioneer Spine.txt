Pioneer Spine Lyrics
Who's out triggering the soft alarm?
Barbed the entrance: now, I wanna know
Who's there feeding?
I want a name, I want a name
Just mouth it, that's fine
The hollow throws its lousy drone
And you don't want to breathe
But you'll talk

Now, absolute the zero count
Zero morphism, its arrowed frame
Whose count's empty?
I want a name, I want your name
Just write it, that's fine
The strength you've grown is monotone
But now, I've turned the key
And you can't call out again

Gather 'round, so empty now
All you've got is spineless sound
I want the truth
Even if I gotta rip it from you
Who's out feeding?
I fed the same
So they took my name
And I put up no fight
The void you throw is all you know
You watch me turn a key
How like you, to shirk away
A sonar's rounds
Me, I just cloister up against its shouts

Gather 'round, so empty now
All you've got is spineless sound
I want the truth
Even if I gotta rip it from you
But you've still got your sound
And I see you staring down
I want a name
Even though you spoiled the one I came withEmbed
