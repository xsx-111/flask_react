Plough Lyrics
"Don't let your lids black, oil down that attractant."
That's what you said once, outside your cell
We used to go out, chant the names of power
Let's hit The Plough, now you're back around
YHVH, now you broke out

No, it isn't the first time you showed up
On the first of the month, asking me for your cut
And some virgin parchment you brought me to read
Why'd you pick a virgin over me?


That's an adult situation you threw
At your childhood contemporary
I was never the witch that you made me to be
Still, you picked a virgin over me
Yeah, you picked a virgin over me
Yeah, you picked a virgin...

The Plough emptied out and that was enough
I slid towards the door but you started freaking the fuck out
Stop shaking, why are you freaking the fuck out?
You better stop 'cause it's freaking me out
He wants to burn all my candles but it isn't for love
He wants to burn it on his fingers but I'm not the one to give it
He wants sulfur and salt and my name on his arm
He wants to burn, he wants to burn
He wants to burn all my candles, no, that isn't love
He wants to burn it on his fingers, he thinks I'm the one to give it
He wants sulfur and salt and so, he's holding me down
He wants to burn and it's freaking me out
He wants to burn and it's freaking me out
He wants to burn and it's freaking me outEmbed
