Casper (1995) LyricsHunting a demon I seen
Fishing out hoof hair behind a screen
Hunted by a dusty cipher
Magnetism, my lone rifle
And the sicko police
Gave me perfect marks at the sycophantic academy
Pay to pray, I still got plasma coming through
Bang and bang and shoot's
What they trained me to do
Windows sweating blood
Choking in on cue
Bang and bang and shoot
How I wanted you like a ghost wants revenge on the living
This is how the pros do it, right?
Wedding chapel exorcism under a dim lamp light
Kids keep trading specter stories
Just to get each other horny
Inside their marrow, intense
Hiding from the witch, I'm stalking through the dark forest
Pay to pray, I still got plasma coming through
Bang and bang and shoot's
What they trained me to do
Windows sweating blood
Choking in on cue
Bang and bang and shoot
How I wanted you like a ghost wants revenge on the livingEmbed
