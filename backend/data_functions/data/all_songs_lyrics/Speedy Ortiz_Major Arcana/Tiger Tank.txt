Tiger Tank Lyrics
Was it my teeth or my tongue that said, "Glue shut your lips, let us take a rest"?
Oh, my mouth is a factory for every toxic part of speech I spew
Late, languorous, and afraid to ask
Caught my reflection in some seawashed glass
Oh, my face is unable to convey how very awfully I'm doing

Laugh out of habit at the lump schematics
I smoked my senses, it made me so demented
I see me and you with the kennel cough
Signaling the sleuth of the trail we trot
Expansion rattles out this old lump

Bats get bristled, the imps heat up
Spoon out the sweet stuff for street-wise smut
Oh, my gut absorbs the fiercest blows, you never thought you'd have to throw

Laugh out of habit at the lump schematics
My psychic tenses make me so defensive
I see me and you in the tiger tank
Swimmin' as they yowl, soon they're tearing us
Limb from every limb to the kennel cough
Limb from every limb to the--
Don't even care if they take my legs
I've limped before, I could limp again
Though my limp is not able to display how very awfully I'm doingEmbed
