Cash Cab Lyrics
As up above, then so below
Who pays?
Rat king of the ward
Fell slack on the course
Then silvered away
What does he retain?

He can't remember a thing, fleeing the chalk of his mess
All of the smart ones repress
They get amnesia
And now I wanna forget
I loved someone who left me for dead
What a night to forget
Only an empty head says, "I wanna be with somebody."

It went below
And as I foretold
You'll pay
How wisely he roars
The chariot lord
Dragged every which way
Tell me, what do you retain?
You can't remember a thing
Torn between too many heads
All of the bad ones repress
They get amnesia
And now I wanna forget
I loved someone who left me for dead
I want amnesia just to please you again
Here goes another empty threat:

I wanna be with somebody just like me
Someone who laughs at a crashed car rental
Someone who hurts in an accident
Someone as scared of abandonment

And all I’ll ever do is untie all your knots, dissolve all your thoughts
And all I’ll ever do is untie all your knots, dissolve all your thoughts
I wanna be with somebody just like me, somebody just like me
I wanna be with somebody just like me, somebody just like me
I'll do all this when you pay meEmbed
