MKVI Lyrics
Drop donations in the box
Coats for curs and toys for tots
Give hearts for ex-hearts time forgot
Vaccinate the ones you love
Anesthesia so they can't feel you
When it's time to give 'em up

Medicate me now, I'm slumping
'Cause I've got nothing, I've got nothing
Why you take and take me, my friend?
I've got nothing, I've got nothing
Moral is, you're moral-less
But you left something on my lips: a mark so sick

Viking tower by the brook
I climbed up and took a look
I dangled down from meaty hooks, just to peak inside
An ancient place with your response scrawled across its cracked stone walls
If I'm despondent, who's at fault?

Medicate me now, I'm slumping
'Cause I've got nothing, I've got nothing
Why you take and take me, my friend?
I've got nothing, I've got nothing
Moral is, you're moral-less
But you left something on my lips: a mark so sick
'Cause now, I'm slumping
'Cause I've got nothing, I've got nothing
Why you take and take me, my friend?
I've got nothing, I've got nothing
Moral is, you're moral-less
But you left something on my lips: a mark so sick

A mark so sick
A mark so sick
A mark so sick
A mark so sick
A mark so sick
A mark so sick
A mark so sick...Embed
