Speedy Ortiz (Bonus Track) LyricsOne, two, tell me your big secret
I got two more reasons not to keep it
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling
Speedy making magic on the speedway
Choose your own adventure
Or your own way to waste
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling

It's a ghost from a story
And his boo's getting boring
It's a ghost you swear you've seen
But he doesn't haunt anything
Fingerprinting cops put out a query
At a punk show back in hoppers someone asks what it means
To see flies on the ceiling
Mating and molting
If I cast a spell it's 'cause I loved you
And if you're dead I'll still wind up above you
Lay back leave it to me
Check out the ceiling
It's a ghost from a story
Closing doors draining heat
Gangs cry witches divine
Milk the sheep and put it to sleep
Silhouette serpentine
Take out your belly ring
Eyes an eggy cataract cream
Eye the flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceiling
Flies on the ceilingEmbed
