Fun Lyrics
Criminally twisted
Puny little villain
Exercised your claws and sprang from the aquarium
No, I can't see good
All the colors on this turf
Call it in the air
You act like you don't care about it
Still, I don't understand what makes you wanna shoot around it

Because it's just made of clay
Go on and puncture the clouds instead with a limb or a hand
Pulling up as you can
Guess you're getting it up now on the regular

Military systems
The first one to dismiss 'em
Shot over the sea
You act just like you hardly know me
And I don't understand what makes you wanna shoot around me

Because I'm just made of clay
I go and puncture the clouds instead with a limb or a hand
First you paved, so I can
And I'm getting my dick sucked on the regular
On the regular1Embed
