Hitch LyricsPlace every bet on a hard horse
He won't go down
Though his knees spasm
Though he wants to grey out
I heard them call me a hard horse
If you can stomach the top speed, let's take it on
Your fever's fewer than before and so it's hard to get hot
Is that a challenge or something?
I'm never wrong about one thing
You're sick
Keep below, I don't wanna throw you
Sick
Now you know that I wanna know you
Don't endure a sickness you could let me cure
And I want to
I set my crucible fawning in a predatory way
You've got a habit with stains; I study etymology
But I never succumbed to that dirty word till I met you
Now I'm sick
Keep below, I don't wanna throw you
Sick
Now you know that I wanna know you
In this blood a sickness you could learn to love
And I'll learn, too
Sell every bet on your hard horse
I won't go down
Though my knees spasm
Though I want to grey out
And you could call me a hard horse
But keep below, I don't wanna throw you
Sick
Now you know that I wanna know you
In this blood a sickness you could learn to love
And I'll learn, tooEmbed
