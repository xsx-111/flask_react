Gary LyricsI have seen the art of my stupid counterpart
The proportion's wrong
Every line unsure, the erased marks like a sore thumb, swelling and cumbersome
Still, the prints get made
Though I really wanna say that I've got her beat
I never speak
When a play date ends
Do you call your other friends or do you go home?
Do you lock your door?
Do you lay down on your carpet
Counting threads till you get to one?
Once you've sat with kids
It's so hard to leave their table for the kids full grown
And my, I've grown some very big teeth
They're not even full grown
They're not even full
Once you've sat with kids
It's so hard to leave their table for the kids full grown
And my, I've grown some very big teethEmbed
