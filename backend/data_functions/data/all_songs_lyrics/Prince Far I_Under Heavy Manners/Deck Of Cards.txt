Deck Of Cards Lyrics
 oh, Lord, to dem that strike with I
Fight against dem that fight against I
Take souls of shields an' bucklers an' stand up for I, you see?

When I see the Ace it reminds me that there Is but one God
When I see the Deuce it remind me that the bible is divided in two parts, di old an' new testament
When I see the Trey it reminds me of the three dreadlocks descended from Jerusalem's crew
When I see the Four it remind mе of the four evangelists camе from Zion
When I see the Five it remind me of the ten virgins, five were wise an' five were foolish, an' they were shut off
When I see the Six it remind me of six day God made this great heaven an' earth
When I see the Seven it remind me that god rested on the seventh day
When I see the Eight it remind me of di eight righteous people saving Noah's ark
There's Noah, his wife, their sons an' their wives (You see?)
When I see the Nine it reminds me that were ten of them, nine of them didn't give praises
When I see the Ten it reminds me of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone
When I see the Jack it reminds me of the devil
When I see the Queen it remind me of queen virgin Mary
When I see the King it remind me of the kings of kings
The lords of lords, conquering lion of the tribe of Judea
Elect of god, light of this world (Jah Rastafari!)

So, I man think of god of three-sixty-five spots
The number of days in a year
Fifty-two cards, the number of weeks in a year
Twelve feature cards, the number of months in a year
So you see, I man think of God serve I man an' the bible
Prayer book, him book an' the sound book
So, you don't steal I (Jah Rastafari!)
Walk out not in the counsel of di wicked
Neither sit upon di seat of di scornful
Dat I an' I shall not walk the road of the scornful
Said, I an' I shall not walk the road of the scornful
Not walk di road of the scornful

Kings of kings an' lords of lords
Conquering lion of the tribe of Judea
Elect of god, light of this world (Jah Jah-Jah Jah)Embed
