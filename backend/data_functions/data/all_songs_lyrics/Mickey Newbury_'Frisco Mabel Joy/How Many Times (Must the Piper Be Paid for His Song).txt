How Many Times (Must the Piper Be Paid for His Song) LyricsMorning came and found her at the window
With her nose pressed to the glass
The dew was like a broken diamond necklace
Left scattered on the grass
She slipped from my side
She stands at the window and watches the rain
Lord, I wish I was blind
And could not read her mind and see all her pain
But from here where I lie
I can see the tears in her eyes
As she quietly cries out for him, not for me
How many times must the piper be paid for his song?
Her shattered dream
It's like broken glass cuttin' through to her soul
It's leaving her naked mind alone now
To tremble and cry in the cold
Any day now she knows that he'll call
Lord, she's wonderin' if I'll be around
When he's gone and she's left to fall
How many times must the piper be paid for his song?
Well, the sun fell through the window
The morning was filled with the singin' of birds
Will she ever remember?
He sung the songs but forgot all the words
From here where I lie
I can see the tears in her eyes as she quietly cries
Then she turns and she walks back to me
How many times must the piper be paid for his song?Embed
