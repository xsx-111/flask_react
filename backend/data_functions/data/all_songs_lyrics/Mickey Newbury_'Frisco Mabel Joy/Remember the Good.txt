Remember the Good LyricsYes, I suppose at times
I think about her
She was once so much a
Part of me
Heaven knows I've learned to
Live without her
And hell, it was, at times
It was a painful memory
But for all it matters now if it does
For all that tried to be but never was
For all the times I've tried
I wouldn't change it if I could
For all she meant to me
I'll remember the good
I'll forget the bad
All the good times we've had
Won't make me quite so sad
When I'm remembering
And for all the times I've tried
I wouldn't change it if I could
For all she meant to me
I'll remember the good
For all she meant to me
I'll remember the goodEmbed
