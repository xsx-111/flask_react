Mobile Blue LyricsHeaded south to work a pipeline
Make some cash while in the meantime
Baby jumped a bird and flew away
Lordy, Lordy, my, my mind's achin'
Drunk and down and out and makin' time
With anything that comes my way
Staggered to the Greyhound station
L.A. ma'am my destination
Put me on that dog take me away
Mobile blue Lord, I can't make it
Got me down Lord, I can't take it
Here in Alabama for one more day
Lord I called a friend in Frisco Lord
He said baby's in L.A
Here I am in Alabama and two thousand miles away
Lord I got them mobile blues today
Aw I left her back in Frisco, Lord
She begged me not to go
I know somebody must have told her
That I travel and I lie
That they saw me drunk in mobile
With some wired up chick from Jacksonville
And brother did we look like we could fly
I staggered to the Greyhound station
L.A. ma'am my destination
Put me on that dog take me away
I got them mobile blues today
I got them mobile blues todayEmbed
