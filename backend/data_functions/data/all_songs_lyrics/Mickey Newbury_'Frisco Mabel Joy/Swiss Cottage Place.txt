Swiss Cottage Place LyricsI turned down the covers on a bed where two lovers
Found reasons to face each new day
In a room filled with memories in a house built for love
On a street down in Swiss Cottage Place
My mind surrenders as all that remembers
Comes to steal the moment away
Yesterday is gone and where I stand here alone
It's a hollow ringin' place called today
Last night I watched baby as she was boardin'
The Greyhound bus back to Saint Lou
Lord, I couldn't let her know that I knew why she was leavin'
Not after all we've been through
Slippin' my coat from my shoulders I said
Hun it may get cold in Saint Lou
And the look in her eyes, turned suddenly sad
When she knew that I knew what she'd do
Now my mind surrenders as all that remembers
Comes to steal the moment away
Yesterdays gone and where I stand here alone
It's a hollow ringin' place called todayEmbed
