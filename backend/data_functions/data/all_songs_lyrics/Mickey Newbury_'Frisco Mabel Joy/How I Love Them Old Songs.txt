How I Love Them Old Songs LyricsDog gone my soul how I love them old songs
'Cause they were a comfort to me when I was alone
The dancin' stops but the music goes on
Dog gone my soul how I love them old songs
Ah when I hear that double Eagle guitar
It makes me think how trouble free girl we are
There was a time I spent my nights in a bar
Playin' that old jukebox until the honky tonkie locked up
Dog gone my mind it just won't leave me alone
Keeps on remindin' me I'm so far from home
Them heart breakin' achin' eggs and bacon country songs
Well they take me back to hardwood floors
Outdoor johns and mason jars
It's all I can do to believe that it's gone
That hard knockin' rockin' rollin' life that I've known
Well, the dancin's all over the music must go on
Dog gone my soul how I love them old songsEmbed
