Frisco Depot LyricsFrisco's a full day from home
If you can afford to fly
But it might as well be the moon, Lord
When you're as broke as I
Here I sit with my head in my hands
Watchin' the trains roll by
Lord, the helpin' hand mission man warned me
That the nights here got cold
When you're cold there's nothin'
As welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothin'
As welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothin'
As slow as passin' time
When you're afoot, Lord
There's nothin' as fast as a train
Ol' Frisco's a mighty rich city
Now that ain't no lie
They have some buildings
That reach nearly a mile in the sky
Everyone's so busy
They can't tell me the reason why
Here's a world full of people
So damn many people alone
When you're alone
Life just don't seem worth livin'
While you're alive
Ya gotta learn to live with the pain
You've been gone for so long
There's no one left for forgivin'
You find yourself searchin' your mind
For the links to the chain
When you're cold there's nothin'
As welcome as sunshine
When you're dry there's nothin'
As welcome as rain
When you're alone there's nothin'
As slow as passin' time
When you're afoot, Lord
There's nothin' as fast as a trainEmbed
