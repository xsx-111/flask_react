Tired (Live 1998) LyricsYou've been talking for an hour
And I swear to God that I can't hear a word you say
So would you come to me, come to me
I get caught up and the waves of conversation they wash over me
And they cover me, they cover me
Should I just pack my things and leave
Would I be a bigger man if I built a wall around this heart
And dared you to come in
I could lie to you and say I didn't mean it
But hurts a funny thing and it makes you stronger

All is nothing in moderation
It's a dirty feeling and it makes you stronger
Well I believe I'm just plain tired
There's a funny way your lip shakes when I know that you've been lying
And it touches me
It comforts me, it comforts me
I guess I should be satisfied, did you say you love me half the time
Well let's settle there, we can build from there, build from there
Would you be happier if I was only half the man I am
You could shadow me and dare me to come in
I could lie to you and say I didn't mean it
But it really doesn't matter when you stop to think about it
The end is coming she don't even feel it
It's a strange sensation, I'm almost happy
Well I believe I'm just plain tired, I'm tired (oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Should I just pack my things and leave
Would I be a bigger man if I built a wall around your heart
And dared you to come in
I can lie to you, say I didn't mean it
But hurts a funny thing, hurts a funny thing

The end is coming she don't even feel it
It's a strange sensation, I'm almost happy
Well I believe I'm just plain tired, tired
Well all is nothing in moderation
Dirty feeling, strange sensation
I believe, I believe
Believe I'm tiredEmbed
