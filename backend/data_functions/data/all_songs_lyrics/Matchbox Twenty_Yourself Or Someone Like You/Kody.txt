Kody Lyrics
Kody sat down on the avenue
He tapped his feet, to the humming of the highway
He watched the light shine down on the broken glass and thought
I don't got no reasons, yet
And there it is and there it was
Now it was clear to all of us
We kept this hat of broken dreams
And we pulled them out, when we needed them around

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now
And please give me direction, I think the hurt set in
And I don't feel nothing

There's a squeak hinge down on the back gate
It lets us know if he comes around
But I don't sleep that good anyway
And if you've never heard that silence, it's a God awful sound

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now
And please give me direction, I think I just caved in
And I don't feel nothing
Hey, I don't feel nothing, hey I don't feel nothing
There's nothing to feel good about here

Don't much get down to the avenue
I could drive, but it takes so much to get there
Don't get off on all the broken glass, the cadillac scene
Well I've seen a lot of good things die and I'm in an over emotional way

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now
And please give me direction, I think the hurt sets in

So please hand me the bottle, I think I'm lonely now
And please give me direction, I think I just caved in
But it ain't nothingEmbed
