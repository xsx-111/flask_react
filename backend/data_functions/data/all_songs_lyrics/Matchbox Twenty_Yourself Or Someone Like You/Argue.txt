Argue Lyrics
She don't, but she will
He says anything to keep her by him
She takes, what she gets
And she never did flinch

So over, and over, anyone
With any mind would think that's all she gets

If you want you can get to know me well
We get along so we shouldn't argue
And I don't know, said I don't know, no
All these feelings, cloud up my reasoning
Yeah, they cloud up my reasoning

I know, but I still
Believe in ignorance as my best defense
So go on, wreck me
Funny how I carry on, and not be taken over

Will not roll over on anyone
'Cause anyone would stand up on my side
If you want you can get to know me well
We get along so we shouldn't argue
And I don't know, said I don't know, no
All these feelings, cloud up my reasoning
Yeah, they cloud up my reasoning

You know it's funny how sometimes
It don't work out like you want to
No, you never get nothing at all
Then she tells you that it's over
Boy, don't you hate it when it's over
I guess something just got lost
And it deeply saddens me
So over, and over anyone, yeah anyone

If you want you can get to know me well
We get along so we shouldn't argue, yeah
And I don't know, yeah, said I don't know, no
All these feelings, they cloud up my reasoning

We get along so we shouldn't argue, yeah
We get along so we shouldn't argue, yeah
We shouldn't argue, yeah1Embed
