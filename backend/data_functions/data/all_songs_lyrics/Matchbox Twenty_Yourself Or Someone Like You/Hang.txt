Hang Lyrics
She grabs her magazines, she packs her things and she goes
She leaves the pictures hanging on the walls, she burns all her notes
And she knows she's been here too few years to feel this old

He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone
If anybody ever had a heart, well, he wouldn't be alone
He knows he's been here too few years to be gone

And we always say it would be good to go away, someday
Yeah, but if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you, I'll just hang

Trouble understand, if she got reasons, he don't
Funny how I couldn't see at all until she grabbed up her coat
And she goes; she's been here too few years to take it all in stride
Yeah, well, still it's much too long to let hurt go (you let her go)

And we always say it would be good to go away, someday
Yeah, but if there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you, I'll just hang
The same for you, I'll always hang
Well, I always say it would be good to go away
But if things don't work out like we think
And there's nothing there to ease this aching
If there's nothing there to make things change
If it's the same for you, I'll just hang1Embed
