Shame Lyrics
What we learned here
Is love tastes bitter when it's gone
Past yourself, forget the light
Things look dirty when it's on
Funny how it comes to pass
That all the good slips away
And there's no one around
You can remember being good to you

Shame
Shouldn't try you
Couldn't step by you
And open up more shame
Shame, shame

What we lost here
Is something better left alone
Second steps have been forgotten
Will you tell me how they go?
Set yourself, situate
Like a fool, try again
There's no one around
You can remember being good for you
So, shame
Shouldn't try you
Couldn't step by you
And open up more shame
Shame, shame, yeah
Ah, shame
Shouldn't try you
Couldn't step by you
And open up more shame
Shame, shame

We never thought we'd get so troubled
(Never get this, never get this bad)
We could never think that much
(Never get this, never get this bad)
And it should never get this bad

So, let the wind blow ya
Across the big floor
But there's no one around
Who can tell us what we're here for
But, funny, in a certain light
How we all look the same
And there's no one in life
You can remember ever stood for you
So, shame
Shouldn't try you
Couldn't step by you
And open up more shame
Shame, shame
Shame
Shouldn't try you
Couldn't step by you
And open up more shame
Shame, shame, ohEmbed
