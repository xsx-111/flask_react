Damn Lyrics
This old world well
Don't it make you wanna think "damn"
This cold girl well
Don't she make you wanna scream "damn"

What's the matter girl, well, don't you think I'm good enough
This old heart had a whole lotta breakin' down
She's got all these reasons in her head

Well all that time she knew if I lied
You can bet she will
She's takin' her time 'til I thought I would die
And I can't sit still

Things got turned 'round
Don't know where I started from, damn
Can't eat, can't sleep
Could have been a bigger man, damn

Oh what's the matter girl, well, don't you think I'm bright enough
This old man had a hard time getting here
You can leave your number at the door
Well all that time she knew if I lied
You can bet she will
She's takin' her time 'til I thought I would die
And I can't sit still

Oh, there's nothing at all
Yeah, there's nothing at all
Well, there's nothing at all
To make her change her mind
Oh, to make her change her mind
To make her change her...

This old house's been quiet since
You went away, damn
Mixed up, fixed out
Don't forget who got you here, damn

Oh what's the matter world, well, don't you see I opened up
This whole part's been played by another man
I pulled out the reason card instead

Well all that time she knew if I lied
You can bet she will
She's takin' her time 'til I thought I would die
And I can't sit still
She says she can find
The things that make up a lie
Well I can bet she will
She says stay behind, I could stay here all night
I could stay here until
Until there's nothing at all
Yeah, there's nothing at all
Well, there's nothing at all
To make her change her mind
Oh, to make her change her mind
To make her change her mindEmbed
