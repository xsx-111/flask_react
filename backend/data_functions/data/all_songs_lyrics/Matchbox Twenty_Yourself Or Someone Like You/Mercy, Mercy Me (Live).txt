Mercy, Mercy Me (Live) LyricsOo oo aa mercy mercy me
Ah things ain't' what they used to be
Where did all the blue skies go
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east
Oo mercy mercy me
Ah things ain't what they used to be
Oil wasted on the ocean and up on our sea
Fish full of mercury
Ah oh mercy mercy me
Ah things ain't what they used to be
Radiation underground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live near by are dying
Oh mercy mercy me
Ah things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she standEmbed
