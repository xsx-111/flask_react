Long Day Lyrics
It's sitting by the overcoat
The second shelf, the note she wrote
That I can't bring myself to throw away
And also
Reach, she said, for no one else but you
'Cause you won't turn away
When someone else is gone

I'm sorry about the attitude
I need to give when I'm with you
But no one else'll take this shit from me
And I'm so terrified of no one else but me
I'm here all the time
I won't go away

Yeah, hey, it's me
Yeah, well, I can't get myself to go away
Hey, well, it's me
And I can't get myself to go away
Oh God, I shouldn't feel this way, now

Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right
And no, Lord, your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right

Well, I'm surprised if you believe
In anything that comes from me
I didn't hear from you or from someone else
And you're so set in life, man, a pisser they're waiting
Too damn bad you get so far so fast
So what? So long

Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right
And no, Lord, your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right
Oh, ain't that right

It's me
Yeah, well, I can't get myself to go away
Hey, well, it's me
Yeah, well, I can't get myself to go away
Oh God, I shouldn't feel this way now
Reach down your hand in your pocket
Pull out some hope for me
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right
And no, Lord, your hand won't stop it
Just keep you trembling
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right, now, yeah

Reach down your hand in your pocket, well
Reach down your hand right now
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right

Reach down your hand in your pocket, well
Reach down your hand right now
It's been a long day, always
Ain't that right

Oh ain't that right
Well ain't that right, oh right, right
Oh child
Right, oh right, right, oh right, right
Oh child
Oh child
So come on1Embed
