Push (Acoustic) LyricsShe said I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in
And I don't know if I've ever been really loved
By a hand that's touched me
And I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry
Well, this ain't over, no, not here
Not while I still need you around
You don't owe me, we might change
Yeah, we just might feel good
I wanna push you around
Well, I will
Well, I will
I wanna push you down
Well, I will
Well, I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, yeah, well, I will
She said I don't know why you ever would lie to me
Like I'm a little untrusting
When I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me
When my face don't seem to want to shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty
Well, don't just stand there, say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated, I've been wronged
And you, you don't know me
Yeah, well, I can't change
I won't do anything at all
I wanna push you around
Well, I will
Well, I will
I wanna push you down
Well, I will
Well, I will
I wanna take you for granted
I wanna take you for granted
Yeah, yeah, well, I will
Oh, but don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute, well, it kinda fell apart
Things get so crazy, crazy
Don't rush this baby, don't rush this baby, baby
I wanna push you around
Well, I will
Well, I will
I wanna push you down
Well, I will
Well, I will
I wanna take you for granted, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna take you, take you
Yeah, well I will
I will, I will, I will, yeah
Well I will, I will
I will, yeah
Push you around
And push you down
I wanna push you around
Well I willEmbed
