3 AM Lyrics
She said, "It's cold outside" and she hands me a raincoat
She's always worried about things like that
She said, "It's all gonna end and it might as well be my fault"

And she only sleeps when it`s raining
And she screams, and her voice is straining

And she says, "Baby, it's three AM, I must be lonely"
And she says, "Baby, well, I can't help
But be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this"

She's got a little bit of something, God, it's better than nothing
And in her color portrait world she believes that she's got it all
She swears that the moon don't hang quite as high as it used to

And she only sleeps when it's raining
And she screams and her voice is straining

And she says, "Baby, when it's three AM I must be lonely"
Well, heaven she says, "Baby, well, I can't help
But be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this"
Well, she believes that life isn't made up of all that you're used to
And the clock on the wall has been stuck at three for days and days
She thinks that happiness is a mat that sits on her doorway
But outside it's stopped raining

And she says, "Baby, It's 3 am I must be lonely"
Well, heaven she says, "Baby, well, I can't help
But be scared of it all sometimes
And the rain's gonna wash away, I believe this"
Well, it's three AM, I must be lonely
Well, heaven she says, "Baby, well, I can't help
But be scared of it all sometimes"12Embed
