Busted Lyrics
I forget when words were only words
She knows the party makes me nervous
In this stage we can't get hurt
Don't try to understand me
We're too cool to be alone
But, not too crazy to get busted
I found out one life just ain't enough

I need another soul to feed on
I'm the flame, I can't get burnt
I'm wholly understated
I found silence in this place
An on and off again attraction
I need such amazing grace
Heaven sweep me away

Love don't change, don't come around here
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are
I strap on one horse and prayed for luck
I dug another hole to bleed
I know exactly how this works
I need a new feel dirty
I don't need you crowding up my space
I just want to get inside you, inside you
You can't believe the heart you save
Giving something away

Love don't change, don't come around here
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are
Don't strain, don't come around here
Don't mistake something more for something better
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are
Who we are, yeah

I dreamed that the world was crumbling down
We sat on my back porch and watched it
(Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart today)
I dreamed that the buildings all fell down
We sat on my back porch and watched it
Yeah well I dreamed that the world was crumbling down
We sat on my back porch and watched
In my head I heard the sound
Like fifteen strangers dancing
But oh how I want you to know me
Oh how I want you to know me
Oh how I wish I was somebody else, baby
Oh how I wish you could own me
Love don't change, don't come around here
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are
Don't change, don't come around here
Don't wear my heart on your sleeve
Like a high school letter
Don't strain, 'cause nothing ever comes from it
And the people we've become, well
They've never been the people who we are

Who we are, who we are
YeahEmbed
