Northern Lad Lyrics
Had a northern lad, well, not exactly had
He moved like the sunset - God, who painted that?
First he loved my accent, how his knees could bend
I thought we'd be okay, me and my molasses

But I feel something is wrong
But I feel this cake just isn't done
Don't say that you don't

And if you could see me now
Said, if you could see me now
Girls, you've got to know when it's time to turn the page
When you're only wet because of the rain
Because of
'Cause of the rain, 'cause of

You don't show much these days, it gets so fucking cold
I loved his secret places, but I can't go anymore
"You change like sugarcane," says my northern lad
I guess you go too far when pianos try to be guitars

I feel the West in you
But I feel it falling apart too
Don't say that you don't
And if you could see me now
Said, if you could see me now
Girls, you've got to know when it's time to turn the page
When you're only wet because of the rain
When you're only wet because of the rain
Because of the
'Cause of the rain, 'cause of
'Cause of the rain, 'cause of the rainEmbed
