Cruel Lyrics
So don’t give me respect
Don’t give me a piece of your preciousness
Flaunt all she’s got in our old neighborhood
I’m sure she’ll make a few friends
Even the rainbows down let us pray
As you cock-cock-cock your mane

No cigarettes, only peeled Havanas for you

I can be cruel
I don’t know why
Why can’t my balloon stay up
In a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel
I don’t know why, I don’t know why

Dance with the Sufis
Celebrate your top ten in the charts of pain
Lover brother Bougainvillea
My vine twists around your need
Even the rain is sharp like today
As you sh-sh-shock me sane
No cigarettes, only peeled Havanas for you

I can be cruel
I don’t know why
Why can’t my balloon stay up
In a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel
I don’t know why, I don’t know why

Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, yes
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, right
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah-ah ah ah
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, ah-ah ah ah
Ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah, yeah

I can be cruel
I don’t know why
Why can’t my balloon stay up
In a perfectly windy sky?
I can be cruel
Don’t know why, don’t know why
Why, whyEmbed
