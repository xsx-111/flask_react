Spark Lyrics
She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's afraid of the light in the dark
6:58 are you sure where my spark is?
Here, here, here

She's convinced she could hold back a glacier
(Between cotton balls and xylophones)
But she couldn't keep baby alive
(I'm getting old)
Doubting if there's a woman in there somewhere
Here, here, here

You say you don't want it, again and again
But you don't, don't really mean it
You say you don't want it, the circus we're in
But you don't, don't really mean it
You don't, don't really mean it

If the divine master's plan is perfection
(Swing low)
Maybe next I'll give Judas a try
(Swing low, sweet chariot)
Trusting my soul to the ice cream assassin
Here, here, here
You say you don't want it, again and again
But you don't, don't really mean it
You say you don't want it, the circus we're in
But you don't, don't really mean it
You don't, don't really mean it

How many fates turn around in the overtime?
Ballerinas that have fins that you'll never find
You thought that you were the bomb, yes, well so did I
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it
How many fates turn around in the overtime?
Ballerinas that have fins that you'll never find
You thought that you were the bomb, yes, well so did I
Say you don't want it, say you don't want it

Say you don't want it, again and again
But you don't, don't really mean it
You say you don't want it, the circus we're in
But you don't, don't really mean it
You don't, don't really mean it

She's addicted to nicotine patches
She's afraid of the light in the dark
6:58 are you sure where my spark is?
Here, here, hereEmbed
