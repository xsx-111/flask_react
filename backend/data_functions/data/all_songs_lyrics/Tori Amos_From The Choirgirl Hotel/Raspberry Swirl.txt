Raspberry Swirl Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, let's go
I am not your señorita
I am not from your tribe
In the garden, in the garden I did no crime

I am not your señorita
I am not from your tribe
If you want inside her well
Boy, you better make her raspberry swirl

Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)
Everybody knows I'm her man
Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)
Everybody knows I'm her man

Hey, hey, hey, let's go
I am not your señorita
I don’t aim so high
In my heart, in my heart, I did no crime
If you want inside her well
Boy, you better make her raspberry swirl
Raspberry swirl, let's go
Raspberry swirl

Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)
Everybody knows I'm her man
Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)
Everybody knows I'm her man
Things are getting desperate (Desperate)
When all the boys can't be men (Can't be men)
Everybody knows I'm her friend (I'm her friend)
Everybody knows I'm her man

Raspberry swirl, let's go
Raspberry swirl, you want inside her world
(And she swirls and she swirls and she swirls)
Yes, let's go, raspberry swirl
(And she swirls and she swirls and she swirls)
Let's go, raspberry swirl
(And she swirls and she swirls and she swirls, yeah)
(And she swirls and she swirls)
(She swirls and she swirls)Embed
