Playboy Mommy Lyrics
In my platforms I hit the floor
Fell face down, didn’t help my brain out
Then the baby came before I found
The magic, how to keep her happy
I never was the fantasy
Of what you want or wanted me to be

But don’t judge me so harsh, little girl
So, you got a playboy mommy
But when you tell 'em my name
You want to cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl, they’ll do you no harm
'Cause they know your playboy mommy
But when you tell 'em my name
From here to Birmingham I got a few friends

I never was there, was there when it counts
I get my way, you’re so like me
You seemed ashamed, ashamed that I was
A good friend of American soldiers
I’ll say it loud here by your grave
Those angels can’t ever take my place
Don’t judge me so harsh, little girl
You got a playboy mommy
But when you tell 'em my name
You want to cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl, they’ll do you no harm
Because they know your playboy mommy
But you just tell 'em my name
You tell 'em my name
I got a few friends

Somewhere where the orchids grow
I can’t find those church bells
That played when you died
Played Gloria
Talking about Hosanna

Don’t judge me so harsh, little girl
You got a playboy mommy, come home
But when you tell them soldiers my name
Cross that bridge all on your own
Little girl, they’ll do you no harm
'Cause they know your playboy mommy
I'll be home, I'll be home
To take you in my armsEmbed
