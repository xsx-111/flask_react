Hotel Lyrics
Met ‘em in a hotel, met ‘em in a hotel
Beneath ground
Tell me that he’s missing, tell me this is one for
Lollipop Gestapo

You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?

Give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me more

I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash

Met ‘em in a hotel, met ‘em in a hotel
You say he’s the biggest thing there’ll be this year
I guess that what I’m seeking
I guess that what I’m seeking isn’t here
Met him in a hotel, met him in a guess world
Guessed anyone but you
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now

Give me more, give me more, give me more
Give me more, give me more, give me...
Can't you just give me more, give me more, give me more

I have to learn to let you crash down
I have to learn to let you crash

Where are the velvets, where?
Where are the velvets when you’re coming, coming down?
Where are the velvets, where?
Where are the velvets, when you’re coming, coming down?

You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild, where are you now?
You were wild

King Solomon’s Mines, Exit 75
I’m still alive, I’m still alive
I’m still alive, I’m still alive
I’m still aliveEmbed
