Iieee Lyrics
Ieee, ieee, ieee, ieee
Ieee, ieee, ieee, ieee

With your E's and your ease and I do one more
Need a lip gloss boost in your America
Is it God's? Is it your sweet saliva?
With your E's, and your ease, and I do one more

I know we're dying
And there's no sign of a parachute
We scream in cathedrals
Why can't it be beautiful
Why does there gotta be a sa-sa-sacrifice
Gotta be a sa-sa-sacrifice

Ieee, ieee, ieee, ieee
Ieee, ieee, ieee, ieee

Just say yes
You little arsonist
You're so sure you can save
Every hair on my chest
Just say yes
You little arsonist
With your E's and your ease and I do one more
With your E's and your ease and I do one more

Well I know we're dying
And there's no sign of a parachute
In this chapel, little chapel of love
Can't we get a little grace
And some elegance
No, we scream in cathedrals
Why can't that be beautiful?
Why does there gotta be a sa-sa-sacrifice
Gotta be a sacr-sacrifice
Gotta be a sa-sa-sacrifice2Embed
