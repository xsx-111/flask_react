Liquid Diamonds Lyrics
Surrender then start your engines
You’ll know quite soon what my mistake was
For those on horseback or dog sled
You turn at the bend in the road
I hear she still grants forgiveness
Although I willingly forgot her
The offering is molasses
And you say

I guess I’m an underwater thing
So I guess you can’t take it personally
I guess I’m an underwater thing
Liquid running
There’s a sea secret in me
It’s plain to see, it is rising
But I must be flowing liquid diamonds
Liquid, liquid diamonds

Calling for my soul at the corners of the world
I know she’s playing poker with the rest of the stragglers
Calling for my soul at the corners of the world
I know she’s playing poker with the rest, the rest
And if your friends don’t come back to you
And you know this is madness
A lilac mess in your prom dress
And you say
I guess I’m an underwater thing
So I guess you can’t take it personally
I guess I’m an underwater thing
Liquid running
There’s a sea secret in me
It’s plain to see, it is rising
But I must be flowing liquid diamonds
Liquid, liquid diamonds

I go, I go inside a shell, I see its soul
And you're doing oh so well these days
You do it again and I say
It's coming back again
Something like that
This Saturday, such was it
Can he bring me those jeans
Keep it back, Daddy's down
Preaching back and to himself
Keep it just between us
It’s, it's liquid
Liquid, liquidEmbed
