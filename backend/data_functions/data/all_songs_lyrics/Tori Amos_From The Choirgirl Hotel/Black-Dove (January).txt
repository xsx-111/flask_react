Black-Dove (January) Lyrics
She was a January girl
She never let on how insane it was
In that tiny kinda scary house
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods

Black-dove, black-dove
You’re not a helicopter
You’re not a cop-out either
Black-dove, black-dove
You don’t need a spaceship
They don’t know you’ve already lived

On the other side of the galaxy
The other side of the galaxy
The other side of the galaxy

She had a January world
So many storms not right somehow
How a lion becomes a mouse
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
But I have to get to Texas
Said I have to get to Texas
And I’ll give away my blue, blue dress
Blue dress

Black-dove, black-dove
You’re not a helicopter
You’re not a cop-out either
Black-dove, black-dove
You don’t need a spaceship
They don’t know you’ve already lived

On the other side of the galaxy
The other side of...
The other side of the galaxy

But I have to get to Texas
Said I have to get to Texas
And I’ll give away my blue dress
Because, cowboy, the snakes
They are my kin, are my kin
She had a January girl
She never let on how insane it was
In that tiny kinda scary house
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods, by the woods
By the woods, by the woods, by the woods
Black-doveEmbed
