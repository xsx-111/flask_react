Metal Meltdown Lyrics

Something's calling in the night
Electric madness roars in sight
Heat is rising, blazing fast
Hot and evil, feel the blast

Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at you

Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives

Raging fury, wired for sound
Nitro bombshell shakes the ground
High and mighty rips the air
Piercing laser, burning glare

Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at you
Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives

Temperature is boiling, magnifying might
Feeding like a virus, flashing light
Imminent collision, shockwaves all around
Generating energy, screams so loud


It's coming, meltdown
Start running, countdown

Here comes the metal meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the metal meltdown
No one survives

Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown
Metal meltdown, metal meltdown1Embed
