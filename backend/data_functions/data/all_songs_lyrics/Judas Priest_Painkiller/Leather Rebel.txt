Leather Rebel Lyrics
Hero of the night
Blood and thunder rushing through me
Till the dawn of light
The sky is turning red
Like a renegade
All alone I walk through fire
Till I crash and blaze
I'm living on the edge

Start a chain reaction
Sears the neon light
Stealing all the action
Always takes the fight

Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart

Master of the streets
Bulletproof and bound for glory
Cities at my feet
I'm turning on the power
Running wild and free
No one dares to stand before me
That's my destiny
To rule the darkest hours
I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart


I can see my future
Writings on the wall
Legend in my lifetime
Stories will recall

Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart
Leather rebel
Lightning in the dark
Leather rebel
With a burning heart

Leather rebel
Leather rebel
Leather rebel
