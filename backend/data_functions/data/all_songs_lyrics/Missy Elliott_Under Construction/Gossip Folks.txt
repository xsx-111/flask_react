Gossip Folks Lyrics
Yo, yo yo move out of the way
We got Missy Elliott coming through
Girl that is Missy Elliott she lost a lot of weight
Girl I heard she eats one cracker a day
Oh well I heard the bitch was married to Tim and started fucking with Trina
I heard the bitch got hit with three zebras and a monkey
I can't stand the bitch no way

When I walk up in the piece
I ain't gotta even speak
I'm a bad mamajama
Goddammit, motherfucker, you ain't gotta like me
How you stuntin' these hoes
Need to talk, what you know
And stop talking 'bout who I'm sticking and licking
Just mad it ain't yours
I know y'all poor, y'all broke
Y'all job just hanging up clothes
Step to me, get burnt like toast
Motherfuckers, adios, amigos
Halves halves wholes wholes
I don't brag, I mostly boast
From the VA to the LA coast
Izzo kizzay, lezzy goh\
Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch!

My gizzirl!
Brillzing her izzin!
Izzo kizzay!
Izzall rizzight...
Izzo kizzay!
Izzall rizzight! Nizzow wizzee wilzzo-izzo-zee!

When I pull up in my whip
Bitches wanna talk shit
I'm driving, I'm glad and I'm styling
And these motherfuckers ask, "Did you see it?"
I'm gripping these curbs
SKRRT! Did ya heard?
I love 'em, my feathers, my furs, ahh!
I fly like a bird
Chickenheads on the prowl
Who you tryna fuck now?
Now you ain't getting loud
Better calm down 'fore I smack your ass down
I need my drums, bass high
Has to be my snare, strings, horns, yes
I need my Tim sound, right, left
Izzo kizzay, looky here
Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch!

I don't go out my house, shorty, you just waiting to see
Who gon' roll up in the club and then report that next week
Just wanna see who I am fucking, boy sniffing some coke
I know by the time I finish this line, I'ma hear this on the radio

Yeah, uh huh, okay
Once upon a time in College Park
Where they live life fast and they scared of dark
There was a little nigga by the name of Chris
Nobody paid him any mind, no one gave a shit
Knowing he could rap, no one lifted hands
So he went about his business and devised a plan
Made a CD and then he hit the block
50 thousand sold, seven dollars a pop
Hold the phone, three years later
Stepped out the swamp in ten-and-a-half gators
Now all around the world on the microphone
He leave the booth smelling like Burberry cologne
Still riding chrome
Got bitches in the kitchen, never home alone
And he's on the grind
Please let me know if he's on your mind
And respect, you'll give me
Ludacris, I live LOUD like Timmay
Fuck, have to clear these rumors
I got a headache, and it's not a tumor
Get up on my lap and get my head sucked tight
Sprayed, so I never let the bedbugs bite
Hard to the core, core to the rotten
Jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton
Yahh!
Millze cillzan sillzome plilzay dilzzouble dilzutch!

Yo, straight up Missy killed that shit tonight for real
I know I know, I don't even care about her being preganant by Michael Jackson
You know what we should do
We should go get her album when it comes out
There she go, there she go, there she
Heeeey Misssy

Hi Missy?
What's up fools?
You think I ain't knowin y'all broke, Milli Vanilli
J.J. Fad wannabes ain't over here gossiping bout me?
Yo how bout you buff these Pumas for 20 cents
So your lights won't get cut off
You soggy breasts, cow stomachs
Yo take those baby GAP shirts off, too
You just mad cuz Payless ran outa plastic pumps for the after party
Yo by the way, go get my album
Damn!
