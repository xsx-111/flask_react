Nothing Out There for Me Lyrics
There ain't nothin' out there!
A Missy Elliot exclusive
*phone ringing*
I know one thing Beyoncé better not answer this phone
Hundred ladies ain't free, I ain't got no money either shoot
We 'posed to been at the club
Hello?
Beyoncé I know you ain't lettin' dat broke down, insecure
LL Cool J wanna be nigga keep you in da house for another Friday
Yo just, just go ahead I'mma stay here wit' my man
Ain't nothin' out there for me

My man don't like my friends
(Girl yo man ain't no good why he tryin' to keep you in?)
He say they influence me
(If I was an influence I woulda been said leave)
But boy I love him so
(Girl we late for the club, why you still don't wanna roll?)
Cuz I got my prize right here
(See, the guys at da party)
Ain't nothin' out there for me (Come on)

Ain't nothin' out there for me, this is where I wanna be
I done already been in the streets
And ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love, and I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about
I know he's insecure, everytime I leave out the door
(You lettin' him spoil yo' night? Live ya life, you ain't even his wife)
He ain't gotta worry bout' me cuz' I got somethin' more sweet
(Oh, you must got a diamond ring)
And I know I'm so lucky ain't nothin'

Ain't nothin' out there for me, this is where I wanna be
I done already been in the streets
And ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love, and I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about

I really love him, he's my baby fo sho (my baby)
I can show him, I love him more then ever before (And I love him)
And he don't know I'm in love
Like the time that we met (I adore him)
I adore him and no man has come closer then that (I love him)
I really love him, he's my baby fo sho (my baby)
I can show him, I love him more then ever before (And I love him)
And he don't know I'm in love
Like the time that we met (I adore him)
I adore him and no man has come closer then that (I adore him)
Ain't nothin' out there for me, this is where I wanna be
I done already been in the streets
And ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love, and I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about

Look, you goin' or what?
Go ahead I'mma stay here wit' my man
Ain't nothin' out there for me
There's a lotta guys wit' cash and they like to spend money fast
Now is you sure about dat?
I'm chillin' wit' my man wha part don't you understand?
Yeah I'm sure about dat
I think you should really go, I heard the party is outta control
Make sure you sure about that
I don't care about no club
Cuz my man is all I love, yeah I'm sure about that
Don't let em' blow ya high, go out and have a nice time
Is you sure about that?
Girl I do not get high and wit' him I'm spendin' all my time
Yeah, I'm sure about that
Ok stay wit cha man, I'll be at the club doin' my dance, woo! (You’re the only one that I'm thinkin' about)5Embed
