4 People Do Good LyricsYou can't always be a strange one
I've spent a year without a hope
For one
Frighten yourself into it
If you don't want to stay
Go out into the light
You'll be better off that way
I've got no motives
4 people do good
4 people do good
(This place is pretty when I see you in light now)
I've got no motives
4 people do good
4 people do good
(This place is pretty when I see you in light now)
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
Send me downstairs
You stand there
You stand there
Watch him wonder
If he's wondering about the star
If he's wondering where they'll make him stay
If he doesn't want to stay
So you'll never be alone
Hey
I've got no motives
4 people do good
4 people do good
(This place is pretty when I see you in light now)
I've got no motives
4 people do good
4 people do good
(This place is pretty when I see you in light now)Embed
