Chandelier LyricsYou've gotta put on a punk overcoat if you want to wear that overcoat
You've gotta put on a punk overcoat if you want to
You've gotta put on a punk overcoat if you want to
I'm sitting on a chandelier, you're falling down on
I'm sitting on a chandelier, you're falling down on
I'm sitting on a chandelier, you're falling down on
