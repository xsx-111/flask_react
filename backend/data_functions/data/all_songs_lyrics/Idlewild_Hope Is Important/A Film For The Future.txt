A Film For The Future LyricsStop!
This is a film about the future
It is the future of your life
You think it's certain
But nothing is certain
No, nothing is certain
No, nothing is certain
I know what you think
You think this film is about you
Well it's not about you
Well it's not about you
I know what you think
You think this film is about you
This is a film about the future
It is the future of your life
You think it's certain
But nothing is certain
No, nothing is certain
But nothing is certain
I know what you think
You think this film is about you
Well it's not about you
Well it's not about you
I know what you think
You think this film is about you
I never realised that this time is far now
It's clear to see that you are the leader now
That you're following a lost leader now
Following a lost leader now
This is a film about the future
It is the future of your life
Which you think is certain
But nothing is certain
No, nothing is certain
But nothing is certain
I know what you think
You think this film is about you
Well it's not about you
Well it's not about you
I know what you think
You think this film is about you
I know what you think
You think this film is about you
Well it's not about you
Well it's not about you
I know what you think
You think this film is about youEmbed
