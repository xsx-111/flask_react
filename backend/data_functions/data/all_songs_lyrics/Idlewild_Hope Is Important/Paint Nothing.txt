Paint Nothing LyricsMy wintertime came fast
I bought you a drawing pad
And then you told me
You didn't like looking closely
You don't like walking home
You're not sure who you are
And no-one knows about your scar
But I told you
To shut up once
Because you're never there
And you're too old to be scared
Cause I've been in
Lots of these
Bad, bad situations
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
The summertime came fast
You still had your drawing pad
But you told me
You couldn't see me correctly
We don't like holding hands
We don't like playing guitar
And no-one knows about your scars
But I've been in
Lots of these
Bad, bad situations
And you never get out of this easily now
Cause I've been in
Lots of these
Bad, bad situations
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Send me here
Send me there
Repetitions in the air
Send me here
Send me there
Repetitions in the air
Cause I've been in
Lots of these
Bad, bad situations
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
I'm calling the art school
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
I'm in the art school
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing now
Paint nothing nowEmbed
