Close the Door LyricsCos I'm the one who knows everyone
Barbecue lungs
None of you know what I'm thinking
Who on earth would believe
A word that you say
Your disturbed in a strange facinated way
Your disturbed
I think your disturbed
I've told you once
To switch all the lights off
You never believe that
You never believe that
Stay near the window
Phone me at 3 or 4
Close the door
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Phone me at 3 or 4
Phone me at 3 or 4
It's time for the math test
I come over to you
At your chair you face up
I reply inpolitely stare back
Back
I'm so backward
I almost forgot
Why I'm sinking
Phone me at 3 or 4
Close the door
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Phone me at 3 or 4
Phone me at 3 or 4
It's time for the math test
It's time for the math test
Half the times I lack sound the way
I really think of you otherwise
Phone me at 3 or 4
Close the door
It's time for the math test
It's time for the math test
It's time for the math test
It's time for the math test
It's time for the math test
It's time for the math test
It's time for the math test
It's time for the math testEmbed
