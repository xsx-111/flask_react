Safe and Sound LyricsThe common mistake is to forget
And concentrate on your neverthough
The common mistake is to forget
I've remembered the part in your book
So I know exactly what is going on
Exactly what is going on
Don't think I know
Exactly what is going on
I think I know too much for myself
You're safe and sound
Until you hit the ground
You know it's a long way down
Your'e safe and sound
Until you hit the ground
You know it's a long way down
The common mistake is to forget
I always forget I forget to remember
It's my common mistake
Exactly what is going on
Exactly what is going on
I don't think I know
You're safe and sound
Until you hit the ground
You know it's a long way down
Your'e safe and sound
Until you hit the ground
You know it's a long way down
You know it's a long way down
You're safe and sound
Until you hit the ground
You know it's a long way down
Your'e safe and sound
Until you hit the ground
You know it's a long way down
You know it's a long way down
I guess it's a long way down
It's a long way
It's a long wayEmbed
