When I Argue I See Shapes LyricsI'm not really sure of all this pressure
I'm never going to lose any of my old letters
They'll stay with me
Until I can see
Until I can see that I'm no-one
I'm not really sure of all this pressure

All you ever do is build it up inside
I'm not really sure of all this pressure
I'm never going to lose any of my old letters

Until I can see that I'm no-one
So don't slight it off cuz you'll be fined
Don't start slighting off cuz you'll be fined
All you ever do is build it up inside
All you ever do is build it up inside

I'm never going to lose any of my old letters
They'll stay with me
Until I can see
Until I can see that I'm no-one
So don't slight it off cuz you'll be fined
Don't start slighting off cuz you'll be fined
All you ever do is build it up inside

You smoke too much when
