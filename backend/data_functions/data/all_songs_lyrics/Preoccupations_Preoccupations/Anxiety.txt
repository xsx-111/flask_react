Anxiety Lyrics
With a sense of urgency and unease
Second-guessing just about everything
Recollections of a nightmare
So cryptic and incomprehensible

Encompassing
Anxiety

No control, no compensation
A jaded need for some astonishment
It's a blunt humiliation
Not at risk of being overconfident

Encompassing
Anxiety

I'm spinning in a vacuum
Deteriorating to great acclaim
Everybody's fallen by the wayside
Nowhere near to finding better ways to be
I'm not here purely for the sake
Of breathing, I am wide awake
Excuse my efforts for today
All-encompassing
Anxiety

I'm spinning in a vacuum
Deteriorating to great acclaim
Help has fallen by the wayside
Nowhere near to finding better ways to be
I'm not here purely for the sake
Of breathing, I am wide awake
Excuse my efforts for today2Embed
