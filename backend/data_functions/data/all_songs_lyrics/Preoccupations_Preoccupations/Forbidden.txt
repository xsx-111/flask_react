Forbidden Lyrics
Everyone is floating by the graveside
Everyone is foreign when you're in another world
But the translation of sound is the same

You'll be made irrelevant by a suicide machine
Mechanically modified to muffle out the screams
Your novel grand possession, enrapturing soon
Tasting the festering, forbidden fruitEmbed
