Zodiac Lyrics
Another circumstance to blame
We're all reluctantly engaged
Fending off the lashes'
Horrible embraces
Slashing so weakly
So close to exhaustion
But hopelessly holding our breath

Loved in a dehumanizing way
But you can't feel happy every day
Cease and desist on the thing that you insist
To be in a complete state of consciousness
It's completely intolerable

Corrupted will, odd ceremony
Sleepwalk us out of the Zodiac
Retake this form from the solemn days
Focusing on the task at hand

You're an impossibility
Fading into obscurity
We have the facilities at our disposal
Ask me at the lowest swing of the pendulum
While hopefully holding our breath
Corrupted will, odd ceremony
Sleepwalk us out of the Zodiac
Retake this form from the solemn days
Focusing on the task at handEmbed
