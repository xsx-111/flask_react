Monotony Lyrics
Destroyed and cast away
Blue, translucent days
Collapsing, ricocheting
Everybody's waiting

Cautiously optimistic
Skillfully sadistic
Falsetto echolalia
Falling into mania

And it's bleak and incomplete
Every siren is on repeat
Get the hell out of the street

The persistence of monotony is blowing out the sun
This repetition's killing you, it's killing everyone

And it's bleak and incomplete
Every siren is on repeat
Get the hell out of the street2Embed
