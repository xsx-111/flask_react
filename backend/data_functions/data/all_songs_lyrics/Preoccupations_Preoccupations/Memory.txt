Memory Lyrics
Necessary but against your better judgments
You were being overcharged in the market square
Overwhelmed and it’s coming from all angles
You were entertaining the idea that it wasn’t fair

But the picture seemed sharp enough
To view life through you
I can’t remember where we were
Where were we when we all went under?

You don’t have to say sorry
For all the things you failed to do
You don’t have to say sorry
For all the times when everything fell through

State-sponsored character assassination
I promise that I’ll burn your things when you’re dead and gone
It’s an orchestrated controversy
No strategies for dissolving in the atmosphere

And the distance seemed sure enough
From Point A to Point B
Your favourite feeling was the ground falling out
From beneath your feet
You don’t have to say sorry
For all the things you failed to do
You don’t need to say sorry
For all the times when everything fell through

Unholiness
Arrives by satellite on time
And I see no anomalies
Between both sides

You could help me
With every little need
End scene
Left here with no paraphernalia
Recede

Erasing (Erasing)
Your memory (Your memory)
Erasing (Erasing)
Your memory (Your memory)

Our particles collide and drown
By candlelight
Our particles collide and drown
