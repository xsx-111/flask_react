Degraded Lyrics
We're throwing caution to the wind
We are consistent in our flaws
Predictably, we have no goals
Incapable of abstract thoughts

Wondering how long it might take to bleed through
I can't improve
I can't improve
I can't improve

Subdued ideas split in two
So solemn and melancholy
Another thing that you can do
Unwillingly for somebody

We're absolutely obsolete
Intolerant and overheating
Leaving our footprints in the concrete
There's nothing left here to compete for
Degrade into a fraction of yourself
Degrade into a fraction of yourself
Degrade into a fraction of yourself
Wondering how long it might take to bleed through
I can't improve
I can't improve
I can't improveEmbed
