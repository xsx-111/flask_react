Stimulation Lyrics
Ugliness got murders, we are all observers
Sadly so amused
Camera flashing fire, contraband supplies gone
Horribly awry

With the ill intention gathering momentum
Shame
Mercenary impulsions, their captors spinning in the
Rain
Rain
Rain

Enthusiastic stimulation
Traumatized in unfamiliar ways
We're running out of things to hurt
Never-ending ways to be absurd

Tactical maneuvers burning through your fuses
Anxious and confused
Can't help but think, can't help but think, can't help but think
That everyone's been used
Used
Used
Enthusiastic stimulation
Traumatized in unfamiliar ways
Your sickness, an action
Otherwise they're gonna feed us

At the shallow end of the foreshadows
In a hollow shell, taking off your clothes
There's nothing you can do, 'cause we're all dumb inside
All dead inside
All gonna die
All gonna die

We are led into darkness and it's alright
We are left in the darkness and it's alrightEmbed
