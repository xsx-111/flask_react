Fever Lyrics
Imitating your intentions
Waking up to watch you walk away
Repulsion and attraction
Terrifying options any day

You're not scared, you're not scared
Carry your fever away from here

In your outrage, disengaging
Turning into the palm of your hand

You're not scared, you're not scared
Carry your fever away from here1Embed
