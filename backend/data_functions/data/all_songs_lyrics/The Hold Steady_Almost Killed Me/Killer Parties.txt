Killer Parties LyricsIf they ask about Charlemagne
Be polite, and say something vague
Like "Another lover lost to the restaurant raids"
And if they ask why we left in the first place
Say we were young and we were so in love
And I guess we just needed space
And we heard about this place
They call the United States
And we found out Virginia really is for the lovers
Philly's full of friendly friends that'll love you like a brother
Pensacola parties hard with poppers, pills and Pepsi
Ybor City is tr√®s speedy, but they throw such killer parties
Killer parties almost killed me
Killer parties almost killed me
And if she says we partied, then I'm pretty sure we partied
I really don't remember
I remember we departed from our bodies
We woke up in Ybor City
And if she says we partied, then I'm pretty sure we partied
I really don't remember
I remember we departed from our bodies
We woke up in Ybor City
If she says we partied, then I'm pretty sure we partied
I really don't remember
I remember we departed from our bodies
And we woke up in Ybor CityEmbed
