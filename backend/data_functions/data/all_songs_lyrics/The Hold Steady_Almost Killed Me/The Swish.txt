The Swish LyricsPills and powders, baby, powders and pills
We spent the night last night in Beverly Hills
This chick, she looked just like Beverly Sills
We got killed
Tights and skirts, baby, skirts and tights
We used to shake it up in Shaker Heights
This chick, she looked just like Patty Smyth
She seemed shaky but nice
She said my name's Rick Danko
Baby, people call me One-Hour Photo
I got some hazardous chemicals
So drive around to the window
She said my name's Robbie Robertson but people call me Robo
I blew red white and blue right into a tissue
I came right over the counter just to kiss you
I came right over the counter just to kiss you
Ginger and Jack and four or five Feminax
Psycho eyes and a stovepipe hat
A ray of light through tight white rayon slacks
We got cracked
Shoes and socks, baby, socks and shoes
We spent the night last night in Newport News
This chick, she looked just like Elisabeth Shue
We got bruised
She said my name's Steve Perry, baby
People call me Circuit City
I'm so well connected
My UPC is dialed into the system
She said my name's Neal Schon but people call me Nina Simone
Some people call me Andre Cymone
Cause I survived the '80s one time already
And I don't recall it all that fondly
So hold steady
It was a blockbuster summer
Moving pictures got us through to September
They made a movie about me and you
They made it half nude and half true
It was a bloodsucking summer
I spent half the time trying to get paid from our savior
Swishing though the City Center
I did a couple favors for these guys who looked like Tusken RaidersEmbed
