Sweet Payne LyricsPayne Avenue lives up to its name
Some nights it's painful and strange
The whole city seemed sane in the day
But some nights it seems distressed and deranged
The east side's where we met with those guys
That said they'd get us high but then changed
Now they're down in the basement and they're bashing out his brains
Kids are getting cut up with the motorcycle chains
And St. Paul had it all when we called
And they were maxing out on medicine
A shaved head and the blood on the bed
And those guys you recognize, they got the same tattoos as Gideon
Strong stuff and she had more than enough
She was slumping over, smiling, sailing off with cherubim
The Cityscape Skins are kinda kicking it again
They're gonna show these kids some discipline
Gideon's been living up in Bay City, Michigan
And he's been working at the Michelin
He got messed up with some messed-up magicians
We got so high some nights Michigan looked just like a mitten
Some nights we got fried
Strung out on residuals and visuals and laser shows
Reach into the speaker and try to hold on to the quarter notes
I always dream about a unified scene
I always dream about a unified scene
Hey there's James King and King James and that's James Dean
At a table in the corner of my unified scene
They want a double order of love and respect
They said they just got back from up in Hostile, Massachussetts
And girl, I've seen your friend, she looks nothing like Jada Pinkett
I think you got something in those cigarettes
When Gideon was living up in South Minneapolis
He was the cowboy on the crosstown bus
And all the little fillies at the Yukon Club
Are gunning for the gold rush
We got tangled in electrical fences
We got wrapped up in the indian fringes
All the little fillies at the Yukon Club
Are gunning for the gold rush
Yeah, they just can't get enough1Embed
