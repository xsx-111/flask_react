Sketchy Metal LyricsShe only pays attention to the prices of cigarettes
She says she hopes they'll get cheaper
She only takes the pick-me-uppers
To counteract all the put-me-to-sleepers
She used to be a receiver
Went out deep for guys that looked like Johnny Fever
Last winter, I swear I thought she might be our savior
Went through a skater phase
Went through a raver phase
I went through a razor blade phase
I guess I went through a hundred dollars a day
It was dark around the edges of the city
The light it shined through behind the reinforced doorways
They're tipping over in the taprooms
They're shooting through the ceiling and they're bleeding on the floor and yeah, for sure
We got dosed
We hung out pretty close with some questionable folks
We got ideas from some dangerous thinkers
We put our mouths up to some dangerous drinks
Some nights we almost froze
But we rubbed up pretty close with some rock and roll promoters
Stayed up pretty late with some rock and roll performers
It's always entertaining when you're hanging out with entertainers
Went through the publicist
To try to get through to the rhythm guitarist
We got so high that the audience, they looked just like ants
Woke up with a backstage pass in my pants
Said, "I used to be a speed shooter
I went out deep for guys that looked like Alice Cooper
And last winter, they had my heart all hooked up to computers."
We didn't see the holy ghost
But the father and the son they seemed like regular folks
Jesus rolled his eyes when his dad made Jesus jokes
And he forgave me for my sins
He said, "Let this famine end and let the 2-for-1s begin
And bless the beasts and the children and the water and the waiters."
It's always so creative when you're hangin' out with our Creator
And his son, our savior
You get your picture in the paper if he lets you in his trailer
It's always so amazing when you're finally coming down with entertainersEmbed
