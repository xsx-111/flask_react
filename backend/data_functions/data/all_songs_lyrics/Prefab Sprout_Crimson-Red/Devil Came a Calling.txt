Devil Came a Calling LyricsThe Devil came a-calling
We took a midnight stroll
I asked him what he wanted
He said your immortal soul
For fifty years I’ll spoil you
Like the only man alive
With power, wealth, a mansion
On Fellatio Drive
The Devil came a-calling
All smiles and flattery
In his hands a contract
Exclusively for me
When the fifty years are over
I asked what happens then
He pretended not to hear me
But he offered me his pen
He showed me a house
It was as big as a star
He said to me Patrick
What do you think so far
The Devil came a-calling
No brimstone, fire, nor rain
In fact, I found him charming
Articulate, urbane
The Devil came a-calling
Charisma all the way
Imagine being master
Of all that you survey
He showed me his world
Hell, he threw me the keys
Introduced me to women
They went down on their knees
The Devil came a-calling
We took a midnight stroll
I asked him what he wanted
He said your immortal soul
In his hands were papers
He told me they were signed
My memory is hazy
I’m sure that I declined
The Devil came a-calling
No brimstone, fire, nor rain
In fact, I found him charming
Articulate, urbane
In his hands were papers
He showed me they were signed
My memory is hazy, I thought that I had declined
My memory is hazy, I’m sure that I declined
The Devil came a-calling
The Devil came a-callingEmbed
