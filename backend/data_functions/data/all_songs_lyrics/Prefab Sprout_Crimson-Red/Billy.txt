Billy LyricsWhere'd you find that trumpet, Billy
I said where'd you find that trumpet, Bill
He said I found it on some wasteland
Buried in the snow
How'd you learn to play it, William
How'd you learn to play it, Bill
He said I sat down on a doorstep
And practiced long and slow
I let my feelings show
I let my feelings show
Trumpets come, trumpets go
It's amazing what gets left out in the snow
I let my feelings show
I let my feelings show
Trumpets come, trumpets go
It's amazing what gets left out in the snow
I'm in love with Susan, Billy
I said I'm in love with Susan, Bill
Her smile is like a fairground
I'm basking in the glow
I got no gift for music, William
I got no gift for music, Bill
He said sing a song of sixpence
Steady as you go
Let your feelings show
Let your feelings show
Trumpets come, trumpets go
It's amazing what gets left out in the snow
Let your feelings show
Let your feelings show
Trumpets come, trumpets go
It's amazing what gets left out in the snow
Tell me all your secrets, Billy
I said tell me all your secrets, Bill
Lead me to your doorstep
There's so much I don't know
I'm in love with Susan, Billy
I said I'm in love with Susan, Bill
Her smile is like a fairground
I'm basking in the glow
Let your feelings show
Let your feelings show1Embed
