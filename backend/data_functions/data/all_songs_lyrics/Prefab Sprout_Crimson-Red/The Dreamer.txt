The Dreamer LyricsShe told me that she loved me
I heard the siren sing
Her voice as soft as dead of night
A pillow for a king
She tangled me in starlight
I dangled in each beam
Now I'm just a dreamer
Emerging from a dream
She tangled me in starlight
I dangled in each beam
Now I'm just a dreamer
Emerging from a dream
He promised he'd be faithful
That's what she was told
A ring would guarantee the words
A promise forged in gold
Her dress a silk creation
Her train a mile of cream
Now she's just a dreamer
Emerging from a dream
She tangled in the starlight
She dangled in each beam
Now she's just a dreamer
Emerging from a dream
Where are your dreams
Did they all fade away
Lost in the cold light of day
Where are your dreams
No one sits in judgement
It's too well-worn a theme
No one spots the moment
When the song becomes a scream
We tangle in the starlight
We dangle in each beam
Then become the dreamer
Emerging from a dream
We tangle in the starlight
We dangle in each beam
Then become the dreamer
Emerging from a dream
Where are your dreams
Did they all fade away
Lost in the cold light of day
Where are your dreamsEmbed
