The Songs of Danny Galway LyricsI met him in a Dublin bar
A sorcerer from Wichita
A wizard and his baby grand
A range of powers at his command
He summoned ghosts of lovers sleeping
And soldiers dying far from home
Like a stone into a well I fell beneath their spell
The songs of Danny Galway
Like a stone into a well I fell beneath their spell
The songs of Danny Galway
In words he paints a vivid scene
Of places you may not have been
Yet listen and you're moved to swear
I know that house, I've climbed the stair
I've shared those overwhelming feelings
I've suffered loss, I've known such joy
Emotions we all know are burnished till they glow
In the songs of Danny Galway
His melodies inspired whims
His chord changes like Baptist hymns
He'll lift your spirit till its soars
Till you forget that spirit's yours
Sound and word in sweet communion
Echoes of a better world
Where chivalry's not dead, go look for it instead
In the songs of Danny Galway
Chivalry's not dead, go look for it instead
In the songs of Danny Galway
Something well and pure forever will endure
In the songs of Danny GalwayEmbed
