Adolescence LyricsAdolescence - what's it like?
It's a psychedelic motorbike
You smash it up ten times a day
Then you walk away
It's moonlight on the balcony
It's pure hormonal agony
Bad poetry its greeting card
- Will the Bard
Adolescence - why is it so?
Ask someone else, how should I know?
It's a song I sang and then forgot
Too long ago
When I was a Romeo, in love forever
Unable to forget some Juliet
Romeo, Romeo
Inconstant never
It's knives flashing in fountains
Poison Capulets, letters that go astray
Molehills bigger than mountains
Your preset narrowly defined your way
Adolescence - what's it for?
It's for keeping your nerve-endings raw
While relay teams of fevered dreams
Escape each pore
It's moonlight on the balcony
It's pure hormonal agony
Bad poetry its greeting card
- Will the Bard
Poor Romeo, in love forever
Unable to forget Juliet
Romeo, Romeo
Inconstant never
It's knives flashing in fountains
Poison Capulets, letters that go astray
Molehills bigger than mountains
Your preset narrowly defined your way
Adolescence can be rough
I hope your heat-shield's tough enough
I hope that no one dares to scoff
When you're brassed off
Adolescence, crimson red
Fireworks inside your head
Are three times brighter than the sun
Girls - have some funEmbed
