Mysterious LyricsYou roar right out of Nowheresville
To find the beating heart
Cryptic, elusive, smart
Mysterious from the start
The gift of anonymity
Inventing your own past
Hobo jive on overdrive
Your energy is vast
Hobo jive on overdrive
Your energy is vast
You catch the world in images
To annotate the feast
His quicksilver task remains
Mysterious at least
Your quicksilver task remains
Mysterious at least
Rejecting others' plans for you
Protest - "I am miscast!"
The mythic fog descends
Mysterious to the last
A mythic fog descends
Mysterious to the lastEmbed
