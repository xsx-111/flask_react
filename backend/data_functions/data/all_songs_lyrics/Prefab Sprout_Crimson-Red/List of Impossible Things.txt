List of Impossible Things LyricsTake your cracked violin
Let the music begin
And sing like you're Francis Hoboken
If your voice is all shot
It's still the best one you've got
You're a work of art that's broken
See what the blind man paints
Abstract expressionist saints
We ride with stateless kings
And dream that our horses have wings
Sleeping on cold stone floors
Engaged in some new noble cause
Stretch out your hands to hold
A grandeur that won't be controlled
This is the list of impossible things
We're on the list of impossible things
High on the list of impossible things
Crazy the mystic's song
But what if they're right all along
Trust what you cannot know
And pray till your prayers make it so
This is the list of impossible things
We're on the list of impossible things
High on the list of impossible things
See what the blind man paints
Abstract expressionist saints
See what the blind man paints
Abstract expressionist saints
See what the blind man paints
Abstract expressionist saintsEmbed
