The Shift Lyrics
Check out the chick with the new dress on
(Wearing a shift and it looks real fine)
They call it a shift and it comes on strong
(Wearing a shift and it looks real fine)
When she's got it on, well she can't do no wrong
(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
You may think a dress can't do very much
(Wearing a shift really turns me on)
With the slit up the side, you can't resist that touch
(Wearing a shift really turns me on)
It's tighter than a moo-moo and it's just too much

(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Can't go wrong now) (go wrong now)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)
(Turns me on now) (turns me on now)

Get your girl a shift and she'll look real fine
(Wearing a shift and it's just too much)
It fits like a glove and drives you out of your mind
(Wearing a shift and it's just too much)
She'll ball it with her shift on and we'll have a good time
(Wearing a shift, wearing a shift)
(Turns me on now) (get a shift now)Embed
