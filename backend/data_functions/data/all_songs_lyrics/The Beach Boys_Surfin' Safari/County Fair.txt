County Fair Lyrics
This time each year in our hometown
The county fair comes our way
Where the folks gather round to be happy and spend their day
A-here's what happened now
I soon decide that I'd take with me
The most specialest girl I knew
I had her pack us a lunch and on down the dirt road we flew

Folk: "Hurry hurry, step right up and win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Aw, come on Nicky, win me a koala bear!"
Folk: "Break the balloon with a dart! Yes, you son, come up here! Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!
Girl: "Oh please, win me a koala bear!"
Folk: "Break the balloon with a dart! Come on son, step right up! Get up there, that's a boy!"

Right then I knew what I had to do
(Hurry, hurry)
Before that day was through
(Step right up)
I had to win a stuffed doggie or I'd break her poor heart in two
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
A-let me tell you now
I passed up a chance when I walked by a booth
(Hurry, hurry)
Where you throw a dart and break a balloon
(Step right up)
I snuck by a couple more, but I had to get caught real soon
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
Folk: "Step right up, test your strength! Come on, son, ring the bell with the hammer!"
Girl: "Aww, come on, muscles!"
Folk: "Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Ooohhh"
Folk: "Come on son, are you a man or a weakling? Yes, you, step up here and test your strength! Win your girl a stuffed koala bear!"
Girl: "Come on, baby!"
Folk: "Come on, son!"

I hit the rubber stump just as hard as I could
(Hurry, hurry)
But I didn't make it ring the bell
(Step right up)
I tried again and again, but I just didn't do so well
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
Can you believe it now
Up walked a fellow and he tapped me on the shoulder, said
(Hurry, hurry)
"I can win your girl a prize"
(Step right up)
So he flexed all his muscles and he knocked the bell up in the sky
(Hurry, hurry)
(Win a prize)
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Hurry, hurry)
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Step right up)
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Folk: "Step right up son, test your strength!")
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Folk: "Come on kid, ring the bell!")
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Girl: "Ah, goodbye, muscles, I don't need you anymore")
Took my girl and the doggie away
(Girl: "Loser!")
Yeah the big strong guy knocked the bell in the sky
(Girl: "Forget it!")Embed
