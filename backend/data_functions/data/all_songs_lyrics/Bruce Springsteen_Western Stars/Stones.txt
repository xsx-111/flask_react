Stones Lyrics
I woke up this morning with stones in my mouth
Said those were only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me

I pulled my collar to the wind and spit them on the ground
You said those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me

Sat on the edge of our bed in the sun
I felt them gather on my tongue

I woke up this morning with stones in my mouth
You said those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me

The dirt-brown winter field
A thousand black crows cover the ground
You say those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me
The autumn wind blows through the trees
As the dark leaves come tumbling down
You say those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me
I walk a highway washed in sun
I feel weight gather on my tongue

I woke up this morning with stones in my mouth
You said those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me

Those are only the lies you've told me
(Only the lies you've told me)
Those are only the lies you've told me
(Only the lies you've told me)
Those are only the lies you've told me
(Only the lies you've told me)
Those are only the lies you've told me

I woke up this morning with stones in my mouthEmbed
