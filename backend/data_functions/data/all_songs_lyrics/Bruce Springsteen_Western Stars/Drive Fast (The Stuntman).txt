Drive Fast (The Stuntman) Lyrics
I got two pins in my ankle and a busted collarbone
A steel rod in my leg, but it walks me home
At nine, I climbed high into the boughs of our neighborhood's tallest tree
I don't remember the fear, just the breeze

Drive fast, fall hard, I'll keep you in my heart
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard

At nineteen, I was the king of the dirt down at the Remington draw
I liked the pedal and I didn't mind the wall
'Midst the roar of the metal I never heard a sound
I was looking for anything, any kind of drug to lift me up off this ground

Drive fast, fall hard, I'll keep you in my heart
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard

We met on the set of this B picture that she made
She liked her guys a little greasy, 'neath her pay grade
We headed down to Baja in the desert, we made our stand of it
Figured maybe together we could get the broken pieces to fit
Drive fast, fall hard, keep me in your heart
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard, I'll keep you in my heart
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scar
Just drive fast, fall hard

I got two pins in my ankle and a busted collarbone
A steel rod in my leg, but it walks me homeEmbed
