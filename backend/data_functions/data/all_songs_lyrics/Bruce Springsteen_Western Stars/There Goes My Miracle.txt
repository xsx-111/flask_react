There Goes My Miracle Lyrics
Sunrise, sundown
The streets gone golden brown
Auburn skies above
I'm searching for my love
I’m searching for my love

There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away

Moonlight, moon bright
Where's my lucky star tonight?
The streets lost in lamp light
Then suddenly inside
Suddenly inside

There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
Look what you've done
Look what you’ve done
Look what you've done, ah
Look what you've done (Look what you've done)
Look what you've done (Look what you've done)
Look what you've done, ah
Look what we've done (Look what we’ve done)
Look what we’ve done (Look what we've done)
Look what we’ve done, ah

Heartache, heartbreak
Love gives, love takes
The book of love holds its rules
Disobeyed by fools
Disobeyed by fools

There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away

There goes my miracle
Sunrise, sundownEmbed
