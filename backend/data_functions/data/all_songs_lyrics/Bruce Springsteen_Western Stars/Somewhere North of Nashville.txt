Somewhere North of Nashville Lyrics
Came into town with a pocketful of songs
I made the rounds but I didn't last long
Now I'm out on this highway with a bone-cold chill
Somewhere north of Nashville

I lie awake in the middle of the night
Makin' a list of things that I didn't do right
With you at the top of a long page filled
Here, somewhere north of Nashville

For the deal I made, the price was strong
I traded you for this song

We woke each morning with hearts filled
Bluebird of love on the windowsill
Now the heart's unsteady, and the night is still
All I've got's this melody, and time to kill
Here, somewhere north of Nashville
Here, somewhere north of Nashville
Here, somewhere north of NashvilleEmbed
