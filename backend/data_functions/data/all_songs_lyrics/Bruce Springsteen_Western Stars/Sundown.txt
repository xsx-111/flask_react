Sundown Lyrics
I'm 25 hundred miles from where I wanna be
It feels like a hundred years since you've been near to me
I guess what goes around, baby, comes around
Just wishing you were here with me, in Sundown

Sundown ain't the kind of place you want to be on your own
It's all long, hot, endless days and cold nights all alone
I drift from bar to bar, here in lonely town
Just wishing you were here with me, come sundown

In Sundown the caf√©s are filled with lovers passing time
In Sundown all I've got's trouble on my mind

So I work all day out here on the county line
I tell myself it's all just gonna work out in time
When summer's through, you'll come around
That little voice in my head's all that keeps me from sinking down
Come Sundown

When summer's through, you'll come around
That little voice in my head's all that keeps me from sinking down
Come SundownEmbed
