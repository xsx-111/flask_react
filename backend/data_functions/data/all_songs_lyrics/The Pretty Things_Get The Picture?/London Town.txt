London Town LyricsBefore you go back to London town
Be sure that your woman, she won't turn you down
Green rocky road from another green
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
If when you get there, it's another one
You'll have to find your way, back every day
Green rocky road from a mountain
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love
Look, if you wait a while, maybe you will find
As spring turns to summer, she may change her mind
Green rocky road from another green
Tell me who you love
Tell me who you loveEmbed
