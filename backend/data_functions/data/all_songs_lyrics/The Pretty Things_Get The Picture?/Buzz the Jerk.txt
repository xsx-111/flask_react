Buzz the Jerk Lyrics
You've got that buzz, know how to jerk
You've seen it done, now make it work
You move around, then start to jerk
Jerk

You buzz around, but you don't sting
You take a chance, don't lose a thing
You move on out, then shake around
Now jerk

You buzz around, but you don't sting
You take a chance, can't lose a thing
You move on down, you start to swing
Oh, buzz jerk honeyEmbed
