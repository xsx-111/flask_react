Come See Me LyricsIf you wanna love, baby
Come see me
If you wanna a hug baby
Come see me
When you need a-someone
To see you right
And you need a-someone
To make it feel right
Baby I'm your man
Baby I'm your man
Baby I'm your man
Baby I'm your man
I'm a-greater than the seventh sun
I got a answer to everyone
I'm your man, baby
I'm your man
You don't got to pop up baby
You can't be free
You just gotta ask baby
You get it from me
When you feeling lonely
You got it so bad
You come to see me
I make you feel glad
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
You're gonna be my pussycat
I wanna know just where it's at
I'm your man baby (I'm your man)
I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
I'm a-greater than the seventh son
Don't have to answer to anyone
You're gonna be my pussycat
You gotta show just where it's at
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)
Baby I'm your man (I'm your man)Embed
