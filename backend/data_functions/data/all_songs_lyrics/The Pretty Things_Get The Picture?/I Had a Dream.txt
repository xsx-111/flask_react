I Had a Dream LyricsWell, well, I've got a feeling 
Things ain't goin' right 
Goin' over baby 
Tell me about a dream last night 
I dreamed that someone 
Dancing with you 
Doing everything 
I used to do 
Please don't let this dream come true 
Tell me I'll never lose 
Tell me I had a dream  
Well well, you know I came homе 
And found you gone 
I nеver felt so alone 
With your voice 
Ringing in my ear 
I just can't hold back 
Hold back the tears 
Please don't let this dream come true 
Sad that it's true 
I had a dream 
Well all, you know I beg you 
Come back for air 
You know without you 
Baby I can't last 
But you wouldn't listen 
Listen 'bout me 
You just turned 'round 
'Round out on me 
Now you know I can't really get to you 
Baby I'm just sick of you 
Sad that it's true
I had a dream
I had a dreamEmbed
