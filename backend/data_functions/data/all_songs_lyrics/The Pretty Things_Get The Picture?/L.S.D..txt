L.S.D. Lyrics
Everybody's talking about my L.S.D
I say talk is easy, money's never free, L.S.D., L.S.D

But I always tell them life it ain't so black
For everything I'm given, something's taken back
L.S.D

Yes, I need L.S.D

Mercy is in his deed I find
He hasn't got a care, he might be going fast
But is he going anywhere
L.S.D., L.S.D., L.S.DEmbed
