Too hot to handle LyricsShe don't care about diamond rings
She don't need no fancy things
The girl don't want a flashy car
Don't wanna be no movie star
Ya - when she's all alone
You can call her on the telephone
Well hey - don't start something you can't stop
Cuz she's too hot, baby - too hot to handle
She ain't lookin' for a thousand thrills
Don't want a house in Beverly Hills
What she wants your money can't buy
She's just wants to be satisfied
Ya when the chips are down
Think twice before you come around
Well hey - you can't give her something you ain't got
Cuz she's too hot, baby - too hot to handle
And now it's getting late
And you've been thinkin' that you've got it made
Well hey - don't start something you can't stop
Cuz she's too hot, baby - too hot to handle
Too hot to handle
She's too hot to handle ...Embed
