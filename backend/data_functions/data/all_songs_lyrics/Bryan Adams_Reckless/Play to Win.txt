Play to Win Lyrics
So your friends got you thinkin' that it's all sewn up
Well I got news for you, yeah, I've had enough
You been comin' on lately like you've got it made
Well now here's a twist, you better hit it, babe

Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous
And I always play to win
Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous
Don't mess with me, you can't take it
And I always play to win
Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous

You were lookin' for a lover just to pass the time
I suppose not gettin' lucky never crossed your mind
Bet you never thought lovin' me would be so rough
Oh, but can you turn me on before I write you off?
Yeah

Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous
And I always play to win
Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous
Don't mess with me, you can't take it
And I always play to win
Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous, dangerous
Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous
And I always play to win
Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous
Don't mess with me, you can't take it
And I always play to win
Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous, yeah

Don't mess with me 'cause I'm dangerous
And I always play
I always play
I always play to winEmbed
