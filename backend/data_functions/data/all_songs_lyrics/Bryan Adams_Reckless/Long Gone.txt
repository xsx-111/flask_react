Long Gone LyricsThe telephone's been ringin'
Ringin' off the wall
It's your Las Vegas lawyer - Another long distance call
He says you get the house and the car
And I get the clothes I got on
Yeah - Now she's gone
Long, long, long, long gone
Now I'm a happy boy
She's long, long, long, long gone
Operator get me Manhattan - Get my baby on the line
Sooner or later she's gotta realize
That all my feelin's were for real
But maybe she was leadin' me on
Yeah - Now she's gone
Long, long, long, long gone
Now I'm a happy boy
She's long, long, long, long gone
She took the Frigidaire
She got my favourite chair
You could say she got the best of me
It's like a legal crime
But in a matter of time
She'll be back for the rest of me
Oh yeah
Yeah - Now she's gone
Long, long, long, long gone
Now I'm a happy guy - Yeah
She's long, long, long, long gone
Give me a little peace of mind - YeahEmbed
