The Boys Night Out LyricsOut on the street on a hot summer night - with nothin' to do
A little bit high, a little bit crazy
With nothin' to lose
Well, me and the boys were makin' some noise - we were lettin' off steam
Well, I looked at Keith and Keith looked at me
And we stole that machine
It's the boys night out
It's the boys night out
Gonna scream gonna shout
On the boys night out
A hand on the stick, a hand on the wheel - we were havin' a laugh
When you look in the mirror and see those red lights flashin'
There's no turnin' back
110 through those hot summer streets with the heat on our trail
We ran every light as we ran from the law
Man, you shoulda been there - ya you shoulda been there!
It's the boys night out
It's the boys night out
Gonna scream gonna shout
On the boys night out
Never surrender - never surrender
We pushed into the night til the sun came up on Interstate 5
A little bit tired a little bit hazy
Gonna cross that line
It's the boys night out
It's the boys night out
Gonna scream gonna shout
On the boys night out
It's the boys night out
It's the boys night out
Gonna scream gonna shout
On the boys night outEmbed
