Reggae Christmas LyricsEvery year I get the same feel
Christmas come I wanna pack my backs and flee
Wanna get away from New York
Wanna find another place to be
So we're having a reggae Christmas
Down in Jamaica we're having a good time too
Hey man, we're having a reggae Christmas
A merry Christmas and a reggae New Year to you
Christmas is nice in Germany
If you like being up to your knees in snow
It's just as cold up in Canada
We gotta find another place to go
So... so we're having a reggae Christmas
Down in Jamaica
We're having a good time too
Hey man, we're having a reggae Christmas
A merry Christmas and a reggae New Year to you
And so now we're down in Kingston Town
But I get that someday I know
Gonna meet my friends down in Kingston Town
And those good times gonna rock
And those good times gonna roll
We're having a reggae Christmas
Down in Jamaica
We're having a good time too
Hey man, we're having a reggae Christmas
A merry Christmas and a reggae New Year to you
We're having a reggae Christmas
Down in Jamaica
We're having a good time too
Hey man, we're having reggae Christmas
A merry Christmas and a reggae New Year
A merry Christmas and a reggae New Year
A merry Christmas and a reggae New Year to youEmbed
