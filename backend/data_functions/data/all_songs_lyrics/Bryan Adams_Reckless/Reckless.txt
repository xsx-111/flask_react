Reckless Lyrics
You're doin' it every night
You play with my emotions
Before we go and fight-
Let's get one thing straight

Is it gonna be him or me?
You know I need an answer
Now it's down to the wire and it just won't wait

If there's something goin' on
I wanna hear it from you face to face
Yeah, you know it won't be long
Before you make your last mistake

Cuz you were
Reckless - you've got it comin' to you
Reckless - what am I supposed to do baby?
Reckless - guess I'm a lot like you
Woah!

We gotta talk it out
There's three sides to every story
Ya, there's your side
There's my side and then there's the truth
You say we're all the same
But I know you ain't no angel
Cuz who you gonna blame
When you wake up beside some stranger?

Cuz you were
Reckless - you've got it comin' to you
Reckless - now what am I supposed to do baby?
Reckless - guess I'm a lot like you
Guess I'm a lot like you (Guess I'm a lot like you)
Guess I'm a lot like you (Guess I'm a lot like you)
Guess I'm a lot like you (Guess I'm a lot like you)
Woah!

Yeah!

If there's something goin' on
I wanna hear it from you face to face
I know it won't be long
Before you make your last mistake

You're reckless - you've got it comin' to you
Reckless - what am I supposed to do baby?
Reckless
Guess I'm a lot like you (Guess I'm a lot like you)
Guess I'm a lot like you (Guess I'm a lot like you)
Guess I'm a lot like youEmbed
