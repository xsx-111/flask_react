Diana LyricsThe first time I saw you - was in a magazine
The next time was you was walkin' 'cross my television screen
I knew right there that I had to make you mine
The day that you married him - I nearly lost my mind
Chorus
Diana - What cha doin' with a guy like him
Diana - I'd die for you please let me in
Diana - Can't you see you drive me wild
Diana - I'll bet you're just a reckless child!
So you've got it made;
I've seen you promenade a time or two
He might have lots of dough;
But I know he ain't right for you
Well I've watched you smile n' shakin hands;
When you're doin' your social scene
But you wouldn't have to do that;
If you came and lived with me - oh yeah!
Chorus
Diana - I just can't get you off of my mind
Diana - Why don't ya leave it all behind?
Diana - She's the queen of all my dreams
Diana - Give me a chance - I'll set ya free!
Since I saw that picture of ya;
Nothin' matters - I just wanna love ya;
We can make it you and me;
So come on baby - come on baby
So here's how I see it...
You got one choice - you can get away;
Leave it up to me;
I'll bring the ladder - if you bring your limousine!
You really got a hold on me
Gimme a chance - I'll set you free!Embed
