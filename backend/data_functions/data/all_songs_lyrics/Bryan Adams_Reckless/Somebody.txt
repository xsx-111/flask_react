Somebody Lyrics
I've been lookin' for someone
Between the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin'
To ease the pain

Now who can you turn to
When it's all black and white
And the winners are losers
You see it every night
Oh yeah!

I need somebody
(Somebody like you)
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody
(Hey, what about you)
Everybody needs somebody, oh

When you're out on the front line
And you're watchin' them fall
It doesn't take long to realize
It ain't worth fightin' for
I thought I saw the Madonna
When you walked in the room
Well, your eyes were like diamonds
And they cut right through
Oh, they cut right through

I need somebody
(Somebody like you)
Everybody needs somebody (Oh yeah)
I need somebody
(Hey, what about you)
We all need somebody (Hey)


(Yeah)
Another night another lesson learned
It's the distance keeps us sane
But when the silence leads to sorrow
We do it all again, all again
(Yeah)

I need somebody
(Somebody like you)
Everybody needs somebody (Oh yeah)
I need somebody
(Oh, what about you)
Everybody needs somebody (Hey)
I need somebody
(Somebody like you)
Everybody needs somebody
(I need somebody)
I need somebody
(Yeah, what about you, yeah)
We all need somebody (Hey, go on)
I need somebody
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody (Hey)
Everybody needs somebody1Embed
