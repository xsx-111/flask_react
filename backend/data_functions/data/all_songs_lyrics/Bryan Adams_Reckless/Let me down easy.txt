Let me down easy LyricsWell I saw you on the avenue
And as usual you're with someone new
I guess there's nothing left for me to do but turn away
I'm growing tired of all your alibis
There ain't one that you can justify
I ain't gonna take it anymore and I'll tell you why
You think it doesn't show - I feel ya lettin' go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time we got it straight - you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
We've been going through some changes
And I'm well aware of all the dangers
Sometimes you look at me so strange it leaves me cold
Now you've gone and blown your cover
I know all about your temporary lovers
I ain't taking it another day and that's for sure
You think it doesn't show - I feel ya lettin' go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time we got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
Ah - when I look at you now
I can't believe you're leaving
All those years and you've got nothing to say
You turn around and walk away
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
Oh - you gonna let me down
You gotta let me down - let me down easy
