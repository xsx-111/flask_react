Kids Wanna Rock LyricsTurned on the radio
Sounded like a disco
Must've turned the dial for a couple of miles
But I couldn't find no rock 'n roll
This computerized crap ain't gettin' me off
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock
London to L.A.,
Talkin' 'bout the new wave
For a couple of bucks you get a weird haircut
And waste your life away
Around the world or around the block
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock
Get me my D.J.,
I got somethin' he's gotta play
Wanna hear it I can't wait
So turn it up, turn it up...
Kick down the barricades
Listen what the kids say
From time to time people change their minds
But the music is here to stay
I've seen it all from the bottom to the top
Everywhere I go kids wanna rock
Around the world or around the block
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rock
Everywhere I go the kids wanna rockEmbed
