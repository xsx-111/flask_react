Armistice Day LyricsYou're watching people fighting, you're watching people losing
On Armistice Day
The watchers do the wincing, reporters so convincing
But the TV never lies
I went looking for a war, but the only guns I saw
Never used in anger
You're watching people fight, say they fight, oh say they lose
On Armistice Day
The fixers do the fixing, the locals do the lynching
The papers deny
I went looking for a headline, got talking to the backline
They'd never seen the action
