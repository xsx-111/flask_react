Someone Else To Blame LyricsTell for yourself, watch me sweat, watch me crawl
Stretch me on the table, up against the wall
You can see for yourself, but you better not say
You're working four more hours every other day
See me suffer see me pain
Must be someone else to blame
See me suffer see me pain
There's more trouble at the dockyard
Party's shouting at the union
Short fuses on their anger
Workers in confusion
Then there's the vandals of the right
They stalk the streets at night
Got someone else to fight
Got someone else to blame
See me suffer...
You can speak for yourself
Before the moment is lost
But I don't wanna shout cos I' m counting the cost
I'm counting the cost
See me suffer...
