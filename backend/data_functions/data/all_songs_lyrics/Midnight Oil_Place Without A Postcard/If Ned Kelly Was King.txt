If Ned Kelly Was King LyricsHollow threats and a great adventure
So much business, towns in the dirt
Company cars and efficient Americans
Three black boys sit in the corner
White woman waiting to talk
Lots of intention but no understanding
If Ned Kelly was king
He'd make those robbers swing
He'd send them down
Out in the dead heart, tourists and cameras
Four wheel drives wreck, snapshots and slides
Follow the brochures but nothings inside
Heavy machinery loud in the outback
Dreamtime developers they make all the sound
Where will we be when they leave us a quarry?
If Ned Kelly was king
He'd make those robbers swing
He'd send them down there
He'd make them stay
And we can hope
If Ned Kelly...
If the quinella comes in todayEmbed
