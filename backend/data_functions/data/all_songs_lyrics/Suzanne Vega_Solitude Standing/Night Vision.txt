Night Vision LyricsBy day give thanks
By night beware
Half the world in sweetness
The other in fear
When the darkness takes you
With her hand across your face
Don't give in too quickly
Find the thing she's erased
Find the line, find the shape
Through the grain
Find the outline, things will
Tell you their name
The table
The guitar
The empty glass
All will blend together when
Daylight has passed
Find the line, find the shape
Through the grain
Find the outline, things will
Tell you their name
Now I watch you falling into sleep
Watch your fist curl against the sheet
Watch your lips fall open and your eyes dim
In blind faith
I would shelter you
Keep you in light
But I can only teach you
Night vision
Night vision
