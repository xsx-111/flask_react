God Bless the Child Lyrics
Them that's got, shall get
Them that's not, shall lose
So the Bible said
And it still is news
Mama may have and Papa may have
God bless the child
That's got his own, well
That's got his own

And the strong seem to get more
While the weak one's fade
Empty pockets don't
Ever make the grade
'Cause mama may have
And papa may have
But god bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own

And when you've got money
You've lots of friends
They're crowding around your door
When the money's gone
And all your spending ends
They won't be around anymore
No, no no
And rich relations may give you
A crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much
'Cause mama may have
And papa may have
But god bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own







And when you've got money
You've lots of friends
They're crowding around your door
But wait a minute, children
When the money's gone
And all you're spending ends
They won't be 'round anymore
No, no
And rich relations may give you
A crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much
'Cause mama may have
And papa may have
But god bless the child
Who can stand up and say:
"I got my own"

Every child's got to have his own willEmbed
