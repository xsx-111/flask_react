And When I Die Lyrics{​Intro}​

I'm not scared of dying
And I don't really care
If it' s peace you find in dying
Well then, let the time be near
If it's peace you find in dying
Well then dying time is near
Just bundle up my coffin
Cause it's
Cold way down there
I hear that it's
Cold way down there, yeah
Crazy cold, way down there

And when I die, and when I'm gone
There'll be, one child born
In this world
To carry on, to carry on
{​Instrumental}​

Now troubles are many
There're as
Deep as a well
I can swear there ain't no Heaven
But I pray there ain't no hell
Swear there ain't no Heaven
And I'll pray there ain't no hell
But I'll never know by livin'
Only my dyin' will tell, yes, only my
Dyin' will tell, oh yeah
Only my dyin' will tell

{​Instrumental}​
Yee-haw!

Give me my freedom
For as long as I be
All I ask of livin'
Is to have no chains on me
All I ask of livin'
Is to have no chains on me
And all I ask of dyin' is to
Go naturally, only wanna
Go naturally

Here I go, hah!
Hey hey
Here come the devil
Right behind
Look out children, here he come
Here he come, hey
Don't wanna go by the devil
Don't wanna go by the demon
Don't wanna go by Satan
Don't wanna die uneasy
Just let me go
Naturally
And when I die, and when I'm dead
Dead and gone
There'll be
One child born, in our world
To carry on, to carry on
