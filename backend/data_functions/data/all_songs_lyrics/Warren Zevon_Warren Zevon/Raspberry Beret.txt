Raspberry Beret Lyrics
I was workin' part-time in a 5-and-dime
The boss was Mr. McGee
He told me several times that he didn't like my kind
'Cause I was a bit too leisurely
I always was busy doin' somethin' close to nothin'
But different than the day before
That's when I saw her, oh, I saw her
Walk in through the out door, out door

She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you'd find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
When it was warm, she didn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her, love

I'm built the way she was, she had the nerve to ask me
If I meant to do her any harm
So I put her on the back of my bike and
We went riding down by Old Man Johnson's farm
Now rainy days never turned me on
But something 'bout the way the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright, but you know the way she kissed me
I knew she knew how to get her kicks, yeah
She wore a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And when it was warm, she didn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her, yeah!


Raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And when it was warm, she didn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her
A raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
Raspberry beret
And when it was warm, she didn't wear much more
Raspberry beret, I think I love her
A raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
