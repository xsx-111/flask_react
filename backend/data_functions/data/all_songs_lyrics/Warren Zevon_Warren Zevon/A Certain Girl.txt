A Certain Girl Lyrics
Well, there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
(What's her name?) I can't tell you (Ah)
I can't reveal her name until she's mine
(What's her name?) I can't tell you (Ah)
I've tried to make her time and time again
Still we're introduced as nothing but friends
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
(What's her name?) I can't tell you (Ah)

There's a certain chick I've been sweet on since I met her
(What's her name?) I can't tell you (Ah)
I can't reveal her name until I get her
(What's her name?) I can't tell you (Ah)
Someday I'm gonna wake up and say (Yeah?)
"I'll do anything just to be your slave"
And there's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
(What's her name?) I can't tell you (Ah)


There's a certain girl I've been in love with a long, long time
