Reconsider Me Lyrics
If you're all alone and you need someone
Call me up and I'll come running
Reconsider me
Reconsider me

If it's still the past that makes you doubt
Darlin', that was then, and this is now
Reconsider me
Reconsider me

And I'll never make you sad again
'Cause I swear that I've changed since then
And I promise that I'll never make you cry
Let's let bygones be forgotten
Reconsider me
Reconsider me
Reconsider me
Reconsider me

You can go and be what you want to be
And it'll be alright if we disagree
I'm the one who cares and I hope you'll see
That I'm the one who loves you, reconsider me
Let's let bygones be forgotten
Reconsider me
Reconsider me
And I'll never make you sad again
'Cause I swear that I've changed since then
And I'll never make you sorry if you'll try
And I'll never make you sad again
'Cause I swear that I've changed since then
And I promise that I'll never make you cry
And I'll never make you sad again
'Cause I swear that I've changed since then
And I'll never make you sorry if you'll tryEmbed
