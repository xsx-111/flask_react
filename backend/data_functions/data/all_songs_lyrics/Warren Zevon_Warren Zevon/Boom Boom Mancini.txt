Boom Boom Mancini Lyrics
Hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon
Hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon

From Youngstown, Ohio, Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini
A lightweight contender, like father like son
He fought for the title with Frias in Vegas
And he put him away in round number one

So hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon
Hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon


When Alexis Arguello gave Boom Boom a beating
Seven weeks later, he was back in the ring
Some have the speed and the right combinations
If you can't take the punches, it don't mean a thing
So hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon
Hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon
Hey!

When they asked him who was responsible
For the death of Duk-koo Kim
He said, "Someone should have stopped the fight
And told me it was him"
They made hypocrite judgments after the fact
But the name of the game is be hit and hit back

So hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon
Hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon
Hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby Chacon
Hurry home early, hurry on home
Boom Boom Mancini's fightin' Bobby ChaconEmbed
