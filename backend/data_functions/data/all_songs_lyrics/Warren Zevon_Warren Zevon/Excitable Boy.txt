Excitable Boy Lyrics
Well, he went down to dinner in his Sunday best
"Excitable boy," they all said
And he rubbed the pot roast all over his chest
"Excitable boy," they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy

He took in the 4 A.M. show at the Clark
"Excitable boy," they all said
And he bit the usherette's leg in the dark
"Excitable boy," they all said
Well, he's just an excitable boy
(Ooh, ah-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
(Ooh, ah-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)

He took little Suzie to the Junior Prom (Ooh, ah-ooh)
"Excitable boy," they all said (Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
And he raped her and killed her, then he took her home (Ooh, ah-ooh)
"Excitable boy," they all said (Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
Well, he's just an excitable boy
After ten long years, they let him out of the home
"Excitable boy," they all said (Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
And he dug up her grave and built a cage with her bones
"Excitable boy," they all said (Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
Well, he's just an excitable boy

(Ooh, ah-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
(Ooh, ah-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
(Ooh, ah-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
(Ooh, ah-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh, excitable boy)
(Ooh, ah-ooh)3Embed
