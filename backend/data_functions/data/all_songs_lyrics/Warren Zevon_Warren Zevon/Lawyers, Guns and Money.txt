Lawyers, Guns and Money Lyrics
(One, two, three, four)

I went home with the waitress
The way I always do
How was I to know
She was with the Russians too?

I was gambling in Havana
I took a little risk
Send lawyers, guns, and money
Dad, get me out of this
Ha!

I'm the innocent bystander
And somehow I got stuck
Between the rock and the hard place
And I'm down on my luck
Yes, I'm down on my luck
Well, I'm down on my luck

Now I'm hiding in Honduras
I'm a desperate man
Send lawyers, guns, and money
The shit has hit the fan
Alright, send lawyers, guns, and money
Huh, yeah
Send lawyers, guns, and money
Uh
Send lawyers, guns, and money
Hey
Send lawyers, guns, and money
Ooh, yeah
Yeah
