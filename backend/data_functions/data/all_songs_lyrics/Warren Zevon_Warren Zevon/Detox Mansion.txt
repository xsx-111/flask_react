Detox Mansion Lyrics
I'm gone to Detox Mansion
Way down on Last Breath Farm
I've been rakin' leaves with Liza
Me and Liz clean up the yard
Hey!

Left my home in Music City
In the back of a limousine
Now I'm doin' my own laundry
And I'm gettin' those clothes clean
Mmm

Growin' fond of Detox Mansion
And this quiet life I lead
But I'm dying to tell my story
For all my friends to read

It's tough to be somebody
It's hard to keep from fallin' apart
Up here on Rehab Mountain
We gonna learn these things by heart
Hey!

Well, I'm gone to Detox Mansion
Way down on Last Breath Farm
I've been rakin' leaves with Liza
Me and Liz clean up the yard
Hot dog!

What goes on in Detox Mansion
Outside the rubber room
We get therapy and lectures
We play golf in the afternoon
Hey!
Yeah!

Well, it's tough to be somebody
And it's hard not to fall apart
Way up on Rehab Mountain
We learn these things by heart
Woo!

Ah!Embed
