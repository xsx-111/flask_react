Looking for the Next Best Thing Lyrics
I worked hard, but not for the money
I did my best to please
I used to think it was funny
'Til I realized it was all a tease

Don Quixote had his windmills
Ponce De Leon took his cruise
Took Sinbad seven voyages
To see that it was all a ruse

That's why I'm looking for the next best thing
Looking for the next best thing
I appreciate the best, but I'm settling for less
So I'm looking for the next best thing
Looking for the next best thing


Looking for the next best thing

All alone on the road to perfection
At the inspection booth, they tried to discourage me
You can believe what you want, that'll never change it
You'll have to come around eventually
You'll be looking for the next best thing
Looking for the next best thing
I appreciate the best, I'm settling for less
I'm looking for the next best thing
Well, I'm looking for the next best thing
(Looking for the next best thing)
Looking for the next best thing
(Looking for the next best thing)
Well, I'm looking
(Looking for the next best thing)
Well, I'm looking for the next best thing
(Looking for the next best thing)
(Looking for the next best thing)
I'm looking for the next best thing
(Looking for the next best thing)Embed
