Rok It to the Moon LyricsI'm looking forward to the year of '88
We'll be eating each other I fear before that date
No more heroes, no more T-bone steaks
There won't be bread and the king will have no cake
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moon
I'm gonna watch it all though my binoculars
Pressurized compartments with six inch glass
A telescopic sight to watch the cast
You'll all be famous acting out your parts
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moon
I'll see you up there if you get the inclination
You might find that it cures your aggravations
Play creator face new situations
Watch the human create new frustrations
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moon
I want to rock it to the moonEmbed
