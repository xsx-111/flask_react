Dead Ringer LyricsHaven't I seen you somewhere around before?
Haven't I seen you somewhere around before?
Bet you're a dead ringer
Bet you're a dead ringer
Bet you're a dead ringer
Bet you're a conkeroonee stringer
Wasn't it you said you was into changing the law?
Wasn't it you said you was into changing the law?
Wasn't it you running around proud of being poor?
