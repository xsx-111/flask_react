English Towns LyricsThere is no love inside of me
I gave it to a thousand girls
We build towers of saddened ivory
In our English towns
In our English towns
The dogs they try to possess us
I can hear their anguished cries
They build towers of saddened ivory
In our English towns
In our English towns
I can see their astonished eyes
Look the same in any size
And their secrets are all the same
Seeking pleasure seeking fame
No love in a thousand girls
No love in a thousand girls
No love in a thousand girls
No love in a thousand girls
No love in a thousand girlsEmbed
