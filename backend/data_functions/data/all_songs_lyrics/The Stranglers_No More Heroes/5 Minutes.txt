5 Minutes LyricsI need a dream where I can live what I said
I need a place where I can make my bed
I need a hole where I'll find darkness now
And if you hassle me mister I might just lose my head
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
They came home on Saturday night
They killed a cat and they raped his wife
And in their eyes there was fear and hate
And when they spoke, they spoke with knives
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Some say that I should hate them all
But I say that wouldn't help at all
I just wanna find those guys, that's all
I just wanna find those guys, that's all, that's all, that's all!
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
The night time comes and the streets they ring
With the fears of a thousand things
But if you worry about your ports of call
You'll never get nothing done at all
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Five minutes and you're almost there
Five minutes and you're almost dead
Some say that I should hate them all
But I say that wouldn't help at all
I just wanna find those guys that's all
I just wanna find those guys that's all
I just wanna find those guys that's all, that's allEmbed
