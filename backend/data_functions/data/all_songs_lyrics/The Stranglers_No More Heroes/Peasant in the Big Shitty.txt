Peasant in the Big Shitty LyricsThe day is sticky yellow
The night was so untight
The cows go moo moo moo
Is everything alright?
Baby digit at my face
Who the man with the smile, mum?
Do you like it like that?
I'm just a peasant in the Big Shitty
I'm going real slow
But if the light ain't real
Then there can't be a hole
Not even some red
Do you like it like that?
Do you like it like that?
You're not real. Oh no! You're not
You're not real. Oh no! You're not
You're not real. Oh no! You're not
You're not real. Oh no! You're not
There be a strange garlic here
The room is full of fear
With empty wavelength touch
It's coming in a rush
It's coming in a rush
It's coming in a rush
It's coming in a rush
Do you like it like that?
Do you like it like that?
Do you like it like that?
Do you like it like that?
I'm just a peasant in the Big ShittyEmbed
