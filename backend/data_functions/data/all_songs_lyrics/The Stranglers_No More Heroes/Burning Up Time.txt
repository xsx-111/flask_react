Burning Up Time LyricsThe Brighton train it goes real soon
My Brighton Belle is in her room
It's burning up time
Burning up time
I wanna burn up while I'm having good times
Don't wanna burn up with other people's bad times
Like a meteor
Like to meet yer
The weekend's here the Finchley Boys
Are gonna make a lot of noise
It's burning up time
You either love or you despise
There's just no time for compromise
The days have gotta move real fast
We know that nothing's gonna lastEmbed
