Bitching LyricsBitching 'bout the things we've seen
Bitching 'bout the things we've been
Bitching 'bout the loves we've had
My, oh my it wasn't so bad
When we had that to loosen our minds
Hey little baby in the front row be kind
Bar bitching: telling you the gospel truth
Bar bitching: why don't you all go get screwed?
Bar bitching: why don't you tell me something new?
Bar bitching: Bar bitching
Bitching 'bout the Windsor C
Bitching 'bout the Western Sea
Why can't you all be like a Grainger man?
Or even a Pheland man?
I'll tell you what we'll meet in Amsterdam
Then you'll see what should be really can
Bar bitching: telling you the gospel truth
Bar bitching: why don't you all go get screwed?
Bar bitching: why don't you tell me something new?
Bar bitching: Bar bitching That's what I'm talking about
Got anything to say
No
Well shut up
There's a place with a lot of eyes
Strange smoke perfume around the peacock guys
And the girls they move their heat
To the impulsive compulsive beat
But that's another place another time
Maybe we'll meet there in quite a short while
Bar bitching: telling you the gospel truth
Bar bitching: why don't you all go get screwed?
Bar bitching: why don't you tell me something new?
Bar bitching:
I really don't know what to say
It's gonna happen to us all one day
And when it does you could have me too
But until then I really don't know what to do
I'm just gonna keep
Bar bitching: telling you the gospel truth
Bar bitching: why don't you all go get screwed?
Bar bitching: why don't you tell me something new?
Bar bitching:
Bar bitching, Bar bitching, Bar bitching, Bar bitchingEmbed
