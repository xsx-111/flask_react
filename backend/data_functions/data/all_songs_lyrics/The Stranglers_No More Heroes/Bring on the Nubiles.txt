Bring on the Nubiles LyricsI want to love you like your dad
And be your superman
I'll show you things you've never had
And hold your little hand
Bring On The Nubiles
Bring On The Nubiles
I go crazy for ya
Crazy For Ya
Crazy For Ya
Crazy For Ya
I'll kiss your zone erogenous
There's plenty to explore
I've got to lick your little puss
And nail you to the floor
Bring On The Nubiles
Bring On The Nubiles
I go crazy for ya
Crazy For Ya
Crazy For Ya
Crazy For Ya
Lemme Lemme Fuck Ya Fuck Ya
Lemme Lemme Fuck Ya Fuck Ya
Lemme Lemme Lick Your Lucky Smiles
Bring On The Nubiles
Bring On The Nubiles
I Go Crazy For Ya
Crazy For Ya
Crazy For Ya
Crazy For Ya
Lemme Lemme Fuck Ya Fuck Ya
Lemme Lemme Fuck Ya Fuck Ya
Lemme Lemme Lick Your Lucky Smiles
Bring On The Nubiles
Bring On The Nubiles
There's lots of games that we can play
Just turn my tap I'll drip
And when the fever reaches you
I'm high beneath my zip
Bring On The Nubiles
Bring On The Nubiles
I go crazy for ya
Crazy For Ya
Crazy For Ya
Crazy For YaEmbed
