I Feel Like a Wog LyricsI feel like a wog people giving me the eyes
But I was born here just like you
I feel like a wog
Got all the dirt shitty jobs
But everybody's got to have something to do with their time
I feel like a wog
I don't wanna go home
I've got a lot of life to run through
I feel like a wog
I don't mean you no harm
Just don't ask me to shine your shoes
Golly gee: Golly gosh
Don't call me your Golly Wog
Golly gee: Golly gosh
Don't call me your Golly Wog
Let me tell you about Pimpo
We met him down at the After Eight
He wanted to sell us some limbo
But we said mister
You've just got to wait
You've got to wait (x3)
He wanted to take us down to Sao Paulo
But we said mister
We ain't got no bread
I tried to make him laugh
But he didn't get the joke
And then he said I wasn't right in the head
And then he made me (x3)
And then he made me feel
And then he made me feel like (x3)
You know I feel like (x3)
You know I feel like a wogEmbed
