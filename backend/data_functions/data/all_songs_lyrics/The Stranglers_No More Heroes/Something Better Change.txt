Something Better Change Lyrics
Don't you like the way I move when you see me?
Don't you like the things that I say?
Don't you like the way I seem to enjoy it?
When you shout things but I don't care

Something's happening and it's happening right now
You're too blind to see it
Something's happening and it's happening right now
Ain't got time to wait

I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change

Don't you like the way I dance? Does it bug you?
Don't you like the cut of my clothes?
Don't you like the way I seem to enjoy it?
Stick my fingers right up your nose

Something's happening and it's happening right now
You're too blind to see it
Something's happening and it's happening right now
Ain't got time to wait
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
Yeah, take it Hugh


I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
I said something better change
Something


I said something better change
I said something better chaaaaaange
I said something better chaaaaaange
I said something better chaaaaaange

I said something better change
Change change change (something better change)
Change change change (something better change)
Change change change (something better change)
Chaaaaaaaaange
