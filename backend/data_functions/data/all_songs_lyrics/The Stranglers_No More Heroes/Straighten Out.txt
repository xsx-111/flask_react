Straighten Out Lyrics
And the first commandment reads
That human flesh and blood is sacred
Until there is no more food

The break of day has come, I see the cracks have just begun
To line the walls, line the walls
I want to see the little girls and boys destroy their toys
And line the walls, line the walls

What a fate for little girls
British boys minds in a whirl
Tell you things that'll make your curls
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out

I'm twenty years or more, just tell me what we're living for
So tell me now, tell me now
Frustrated intellect, the government capitulation
Follows now, follows now

What a fate for little girls
British boys minds in a whirl
Tell you things that'll make your curls
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out
The break of day has come, I see the cracks have just begun
To line the walls, line the walls
I want to see the little girls and boys destroy their toys
And line the walls, line the walls

What a fate for little girls
British boys minds in a whirl
Tell you things that'll make your curls
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out


Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten out
Straighten out, straighten outEmbed
