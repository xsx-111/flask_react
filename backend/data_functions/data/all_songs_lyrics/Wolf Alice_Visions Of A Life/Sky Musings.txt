Sky Musings Lyrics
How high do planes fly?
40,000 feet in the sky is how high
Is it the pressure 'cause I’m out of my mind
A compressed lack of oxygen making me high
And these nighttime plane movies
Are prompting sky musings
Life seems so confusing
Fear inducing, tears producing

Maybe it's this mini wine
Maybe it’s this storyline
Two people fall in love on the night of their lives
Never meet again 'til he’s married, has a wife
And now I think of all the people I've cared for
Did love pass me by when I had feelings I was scared of?
'Cause I feel so... when I should feel...
I feel so... when I should feel...

Stupid thoughts for a stupid girl!
Look out of your window, you’re on top of the world
23 years old and you’re acting like it’s over
Only over if we crash, hit the ground down below us
If we crash
If we crash
Imagine that
If we crash
I don't wanna land no more
Sink my feet into the sand no more
I'll float forever in the interim
No place in particular
No sink or swim, just fly
I don't understand no more
I had life figured out before
Will my head stay up in the clouds
When they open those dark and heavy metallic doors?

"20 minutes before we're back on the ground"
No, keep this thing going
Turn this fucking thing around
"Ma'am, you need to wear your safety belt"
Well, wring it round my neck, maybe that will help
I’m sorry
I lost myself for a minute
Could I have a glass of water?

God
Is that you?
I guess I'm closer up here
I could really use some help
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
