After the Zero Hour Lyrics
Suddenly, she lost control of her world
A fire blazed and a chaos unfurled
A transcendent invitation
To the zero hour
She gave in to the temptation
High on curiosity
High on power

But this girl refused to die
So she drank the milk of life
Was it the moon and the changing tide?
Yeah, this girl refused to die
So she drank the milk of life
Felt like the start of the ninth life


To feel pleasure again
To feel love
Adventurous and sensuous, as high as the planes above
Don't wait with bated breath
For this to all turn sour
She's learnt how to say yes
High on curiosity
High on power
So this girl refused to cry
But embrace her lust for life
Was it the moon and the changing tide?
Yeah, this girl refused to cry
But embrace her lust for life
Eyes straight ahead and open wide3Embed
