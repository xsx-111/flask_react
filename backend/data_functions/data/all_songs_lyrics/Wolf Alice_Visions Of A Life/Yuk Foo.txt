Yuk Foo Lyrics
Am I a bitch to not like you anymore?
Punch me in my face, I wouldn't even fight you no more

'Cause you bore me
You bore me to death
Well, deplore me
No, I don't give a shit

I wanna fuck all the people I meet
Fuck all my friends and all the people in the street

'Cause you bore me
You bore me to death
Well, deplore me
Well, I don't give a shit (Shit, shit, shit)

I don't wanna be cruel, but you're really grinding
I'm not a fool but I have a rage and it's blinding
I feel it coming, is it exciting?
I feel it coming, yeah I'm unwinding
You bore me
You bore me to death
Well, deplore me
No, I don't give a shit
You bore me
You bore me to death
Well, deplore me
No, I don't give a shit

You bore me to death
No, I don't give a shit

Yeah I have feelings, 'cause I'm a human
A totally self-destructive, constantly consuming
And now I'm fucked, and that fucks you too
So fuck the world, and you, and you and you and

You bore me
You bore me to death
Well, deplore me
No, I don't give a shit
You bore me
You bore me to death
Well, deplore me
No, I don't give a shit
You bore me to death
No, I don't give a shit
You bore me to death
No, I don't give a shit8Embed
