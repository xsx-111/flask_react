St. Purple & Green Lyrics
You might be changing
But you're still there
And you're still my Nana

I hope you get to the place you've seen
I heard you talk about it
You called it purple and green
There you'd get given your crown
As the smartest woman that there ever was around

You might be changing
But you're still there
And you're still my Nana

Sing me a Russian lullaby
To take me away from here
To somewhere green as your eyes
You can with your magic spells
With the click of the fingers and to the chime of the Bow bells

You might be changing
But you're still there
And you're still my Nana
One step after the other
One step after the other
One step after the other
One step after the other
(Inside, I see purple and green)
One step after the other
(Inside, I see purple and green)
One step after the other
(Inside, I see purple and green)
One step after the other
(Inside, I see purple and green)2Embed
