Planet Hunter Lyrics
A moment's happiness
Under the influence
I tried all night to recreate
And it was never ever gonna last long
And it was only ever gonna go wrong
And in the morning I only have myself to hate

Am I a planet hunter
Or a brave deviator?
I left my mind behind in 2015
Am I a planet hunter
Or a brave deviator?
I left my mind behind in 2015
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

A moment's madness
Compliments your innocence
I tried all night to initiate (Ooh-ooh)
And I only ever try to have fun
I'm only old when I donâ€™t feel young
And if you're with me, yeah
You can come, yeah, along (Ooh-ooh)
Am I a planet hunter
Or a brave deviator?
I left my mind behind in 2015
Am I a planet hunter
Or a brave deviator?
I left my mind behind in 2015
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

A moment's happiness
A moment's madness2Embed
