Space & Time Lyrics
I hope my body gets better
Do I mean my body or my mind?
I hate the word "forever"
Hate the word "change"
I just need time
Give me time
Space and time

Take me out to the future
Just so I can look back into the past

I hope my body gets better
Do I mean my body or my mind?
I hate the word "forever"
Hate the word "change"
I just need time
Give me time
Space and time

Oh God, I was strange now weren't I?
I hope that when I look back, I will laugh
I feel I'm losing control of my body
Control of my moods and my decisions and my money
I don't want to come undone
I am set to self-destruct

I hope my body gets better
Do I mean my body or my mind?
I hate the word "forever"
Hate the word "change"
I just need time
Give me time
