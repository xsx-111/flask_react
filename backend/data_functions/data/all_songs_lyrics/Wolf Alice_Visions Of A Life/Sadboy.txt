Sadboy Lyrics
Who hurt you, sadboy?
There's a dark cloud above your head
Who hurt you, sadboy?
You act like you're already dead
But you think too much
Yeah, you think too much

Who hurt you, fashion boy?
There's a dark cloud above your head
Who hurt you, sadboy?
You act like you're already dead
But you think too much
Probably drink too much


Bathe in that blue light, baby
'Cause here comes the night
Your truest friend

I was waiting
Waiting for anything to happen
Waiting for love?
I was just waiting for this not to hurt
I was waiting
Waiting for anything to happen
Waiting for love?
I was just waiting for this not to hurt
I was waiting
Waiting for anything to happen
Waiting for love?
I was just waiting for this not to hurt
I was waiting
(What you waiting for?)
Waiting for anything to happen
(What you waiting for?)
Waiting for love?
I was just waiting for this not to hurt4Embed
