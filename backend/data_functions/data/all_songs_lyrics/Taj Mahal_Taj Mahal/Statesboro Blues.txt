Statesboro Blues Lyrics
Yes now, wake up, mama, turn your lamp down low
Wake up, mama, turn your lamp down low
Have you got the nerve drive Papa Taj from your door?

Woke up in the morning, baby, I had them Statesboro Blues
Statesboro, Georgia that is
Woke up this morning had them Statesboro Blues
I looked over in the corner, grandma baby had 'em too

Mama died and left me reckless, papa died and left me wild
I ain't good lookin' baby but I'm someone's sweet angel-child
Goin' to the country, baby do you want to go
I know if you can't make it, your sister Lucille said she want to go

You know I love that woman better than any woman I've ever seen
Yes I love that woman better than any woman I've ever seen
She treat me like a king
I treat her like she, she was a dog gone queen

Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Wake up momma, turn your lamp down low
Have you got the nerve drive Papa Taj from your door?Embed
