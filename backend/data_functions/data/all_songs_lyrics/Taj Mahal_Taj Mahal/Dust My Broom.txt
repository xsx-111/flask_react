Dust My Broom LyricsI'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll
Dust my broom
I'm gettin' up soon in the mornin'
I believe I'll dust my broom
I quit the best girl I'm lovin'
Now my friends can get in my room
I'm gonna write a letter, telephone every town I know
I'm gonna write a letter, telephone every town I know
If I don't find her in Mississippi
She be in East Monroe I know
And I don't want no woman
Wants every downtown man she meets
No I don't want no woman
Wants every downtown man she meets
Man, she's a no good
Doney
They shouldn't allow her on the street, yeah
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I believe, I believe my time ain't long
I ain't gonna leave my baby
And break up my happy homeEmbed
