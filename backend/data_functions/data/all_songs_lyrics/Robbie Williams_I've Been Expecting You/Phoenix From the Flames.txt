Phoenix From the Flames Lyrics
Silence shields the pain
So you say nothing
Feel they've rigged the game
And you're done with loving
Only you can see the darkness in the northern lights

Phoenix from the flames
We will rise together
They will know our names
Can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain
I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
Just like a phoenix from the flames

Wish they'd take you back
Cause you miss heaven
Too many bags to pack
So leave them where they are
Tonight you're flying on a golden dream

Phoenix from the flames
We will rise together
They will know our names
Can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain
I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
Everybody's talking
Nobody's listening
Too busy thinking 'bout what you've been missing
Everybody said you're gonna take it
Too far baby now
Well come on
When you're done with lovin'
It comes down to nothing
Can you feel it
Can you feel it
Can you feel it

Phoenix from the flames
We will rise together
They will know our names
Can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain
I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
Just like a phoenix from the flames
Phoenix from the flames
We will rise together
They will know our names
Can you feel it?
Shelter me from pain
I always wanna feel this way, oh yeah
Just like a phoenix from the flames
Why don't you come and deny it?
You know you can't deny it
I always wanna feel this way
Just like a phoenix from the flamesEmbed
