Grace Lyrics
Sometimes I feel like I am sailing on a sunken dream
I try to read the signs but don't know what they mean
I know when I'm with you
I'm a rich man baby

Grace, I'm not yet born
Come embrace a soul that's torn
I have got so much to give you

My heart is starved of love in these radio days
I try to listen hard to what my conscience says
I know I've sold my soul
I'm going to earn it back now

Grace, I'm not yet born
Come embrace a soul that's torn
I have got so much to give you

Now that you believe in me
We can fly away somewhere safe
I know that you will always be
Giving more than you take
I know when I'm with you
I'm a rich man baby

Grace, I'm not yet born
Come embrace a soul that's torn
Grace, it can mend
If you make my heart your friend

Grace
Grace
