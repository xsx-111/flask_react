These Dreams Lyrics
She lies on the bed with her hands in her head and she screams
He gets a kick out of losing the plot, so it seems
He makes you all laugh so she's the one doing harm
But how can you fight when she's not the one under his arm

These dreams have let you down
Take it, don't break it, just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down

You never stopped loving his misfortunate lazy ways
All the memories that you should've had are a cabaret haze
There's just a hole where you know he should've been
There's no one worse off than you, when you can't describe what you've seen

These dreams have let you down
Take it, don't break it, just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down

Where do you go when you're all alone in your bed
Do you cry in your sleep 'cause it's better unsaid
Have you forgotten your past because that's how it seems
Is it too hard to think so you edit your dreams and play them back again and again
These dreams have let you down
Take it, don't break it, just turn it around
These dreams won't let you down

You've got tomorrow tomorrow
You've got tomorrow tomorrow
You've got tomorrow tomorrow
You've got tomorrow tomorrow
You've got tomorrow tomorrowEmbed
