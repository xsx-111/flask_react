Man Machine Lyrics
Sitting in the cheap seats underneath the stars
I'm heading back to base, I'll drop you off at Mars
I'm sure I know your face or what star you're from
I try to make conversation but I'm too far gone

I'm a man machine
Drinking gasoline
Super human being
Shooting laser beams

How you gonna leave, when your bags ain't packed?
And how you gonna shoot, when we're back to back?
How d'you tell a joke, when you can't laugh?
You know that you're the punchline, baby, take a bath

I'm a man machine
Drinking gasoline
Super human being
I'm a queen's dream

The dog has ate my homework today
It's not done, it ain't done
I have heard they're not very well
In the sun
'Cause I'm a man machine
I'm a queen's dream
Drinking gasoline
I'm a queens dream
Yeah, help

How you gonna live for love lying on your back?
And how you gonna keep it clean in a dirty mac?
How you gonna breathe when you're lost in space?
You're dazed and amused, talking through a different face

'Cause I'm a man machine
Drinking gasoline
I'm a teen dream
I'm a man machine
I'm a man machine
I'm a man machine
Drinking gasolineEmbed
