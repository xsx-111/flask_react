Millennium Lyrics
We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
Millennium

Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
But we've been making money
Since the day that we were born
Got to slow down
'Cause we're low down
Run around in circles
Live a life of solitude
Till we find ourselves a partner
Someone to relate to
Then we'll slow down
Before we fall down

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
'Cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium

Live for liposuction
And detox for your rent
Overdose at Christmas
And give it up for Lent
My friends are all so cynical
Refuse to keep the faith
We all enjoy the madness
'Cause we know we're gonna fade away
We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
'Cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium

Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
Millennium, millennium

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
'Cause we know we're falling from grace
Millennium
(Sometimes you know)

And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes
And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes
We've got stars directing our fate (Millennium)
And we're praying it's not too late (Millennium)
'Cause we know we're falling from grace (Millennium)
(And we won't stop)
We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
'Cause we know we're falling from grace
