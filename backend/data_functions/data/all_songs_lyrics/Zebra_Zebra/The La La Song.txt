The La La Song Lyrics
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
Ah!
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
Ah!

Yeah!
I won't be the fool in my life
In my life
I can't change the rules in my life
In my life

In all your silence
I knew it all along
You haven't got the sense to know
What's right from what is wrong
And I really haven't got the time to
Tell you about the things that are absurd

Don't fear tomorrow
Don't fear tomorrow
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
Ah!

Yeah!
I won't play the fool to your knife
To your knife
You can't change the tune in my sight
In my life

With all your silence
I knew it all along
You haven't got the nerve to write the words within this song
And you really haven't got the time to tell me why you really are
You really haven't got the time to tell me why you really are
You really haven't got the time to tell me why you really are afraid

Don't fear tomorrow
Don't fear tomorrow

La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la

La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la-laEmbed
