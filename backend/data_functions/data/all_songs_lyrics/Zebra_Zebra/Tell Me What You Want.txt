Tell Me What You Want Lyrics
I've been wasting my time
I am losing my mind
My head's on the floor
Forevermore
I have given you all
All that I had
But with a slam of the door
You've driven me mad
Now I'm sad!

Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!

You have taken it all
All of my love
Unrelenting you told
You told me a lie, so I can cry
There aren't words for it all
All that I feel
With the palm of your hand
You crushed me for real
Now what's the deal!
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!
What you want


Tell me now!
I'm wishing to God, you're gonna say you miss me!
Tell me now!
I'm crossing my fingers, that you say you're gonna kiss me!
Why don't you tell me now!
I'm wishing to God, you're gonna say you miss me
Tell me now!
I've got my fingers crossed, you'll kiss me one more time!

So I can say I ain't been wasting my time
I am losing my mind
My head's on the floor
Forevermore
I have given you all
All that I had
But with the slam of the door
You've driven me mad
Now I'm sad
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!

I need you so bad!
You got to tell me, tell me what you want!
I need you so bad!
You got to tell me, tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!
Tell me what you want!Embed
