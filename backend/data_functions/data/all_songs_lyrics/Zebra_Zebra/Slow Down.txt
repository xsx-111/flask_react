Slow Down Lyrics
Ooo, well, come on pretty baby, won't you walk with me
Come on pretty baby, won't you talk with me
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance
Try to save our romance

Slow down
Baby, now you're moving way too fast
Ooo, you've got to give me a little lovin'
Give me a little lovin'
Ow! If you want our love to last

Well, I tried to take you home, baby, after school
Carry your books home, too
I need your lovin' baby, oh so fast
The best little woman I ever had

Slow down
Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You've got to give me a little lovin'
Give me a little lovin'
Woo! If you want our love to last
Knock me down
Step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you want to do
What the hell you tryin' to do

Slow down
Baby-by-by-by-by-by-by-by, now you're moving way too fast
You've got to give me a little lovin'
Give me a little lovin'
Brrr! If you want our love to last

Brrr!
Brrr!
Brrr!
Brrr!
Give it right now! (right now!)
Give me tea-time! (tea-time!)
Give me 3, give me 4, give me 5, give me 6, give me 8 or 9 people alive!
You got to give me more now!
Give it right now!
Give me tea-time!
Give me 3, give me 4, give me 5, give me 8
Rumba!
Rumba!
Rumba!Embed
