One More Chance Lyrics
If I could only relive yesterday
I think I'd try to do it right
If I had one more chance to be with you
I think it just might save my life

Just one more chance (Just one more chance)
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance, ow!
Just one more chance (Just one more chance)
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance, ow!

I'm caught in the same old world
And I just can't get my head unwhirled
And I'm looking for any old place to hide

I took a journey down through paradise
I think I'd like to make it twice
I took another journey yesterday
I hope it just won't ruin my life, ow!

Just one more chance (Just one more chance)
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance, ow! (One more chance, one more chance, one more chance, one more chance)
Just one more chance (Just one more chance)
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance (One more chance, one more chance, one more chance, one more chance)
Ow!
Just one more chance (Just one more chance)
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance, ow! (One more chance, one more chance, one more chance, one more chance)
Just one more chance (Just one more chance)
And I will be your love forever
One more chance, one more chance, ow! (One more chance, one more chance, one more chance, one more chance)
Just one more chance, just one more chance!
Bring it!Embed
