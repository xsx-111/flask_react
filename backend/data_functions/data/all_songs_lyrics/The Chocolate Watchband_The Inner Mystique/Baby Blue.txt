Baby Blue Lyrics
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

Look out babe, the sky is falling through
And, it’s all over now, Baby Blue

Leave your stepping stones behind, girl start anew
Forget about the debts you have, they will not follow you
Your lover who has just walked through the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor

Look out babe, the carpets fallen over you
And, it’s all over now, Baby Blue

Well, strike another match girl, go, go start anew
Go start anew
Cause it’s all over now, Baby Blue

It’s all over, all over now, Baby Blue, yeah, yes
It’s all over, all over, all over, Baby BlueEmbed
