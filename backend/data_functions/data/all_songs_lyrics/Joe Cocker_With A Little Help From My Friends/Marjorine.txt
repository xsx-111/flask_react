Marjorine Lyrics
Marjorine, where have you been?
Did you meet the queen, Marjorine?
Let me know; Why did you go?
Why don't you show, Marjorine?
Oh, down by the sea, searchin' for me, Marjorine
I want you back, but you will not get in the sack, no!

Each time I go to town, I see your face in a cloud
And when I come back home, I call your name out aloud

Marjorine, life is too short
You'll just get caught, Marjorine
Try to find what's on your mind
Won't be unkind, Marjorine
Oh, clouds start to form, keeping you warm, Marjorine
Life can be clean; Where have you been, oh, Marjorine?

Each time I go to town, I see your face in a cloud
And when I come back home, I call your name out aloud

Baa-ba-ba-ba-babababa-babababa-ba
Baa-ba-ba-ba-babababa-babababa-baaaa!
Each time I go to town, I see your face in a cloud
Oh, when I come back home, I call your name out aloud

Oooh, each time I go to town, I see your face in a cloud
And when I come back home...1Embed
