The New Age of the Lily LyricsIt's the new age of Lily
Kinda silly but I read it in a book
And if you think that it's silly
Come to our house and you can take a look
Though one said, "Lily's for the dead"
Went right to the head, I'm sure
Now, I find flowers of all kinds
Didn't change their minds, no cure
It's the new age of the Lily
Willy-Lily, well, now I've let it all
And if you think that it's silly
In our garden, they're very, very tall
Though one said, "Lily's for the dead"
Went right to the heads, I'm sure
Now, I find flowers of all kinds
Didn't change their minds, no cureEmbed
