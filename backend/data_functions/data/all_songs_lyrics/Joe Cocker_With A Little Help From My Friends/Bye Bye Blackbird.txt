Bye Bye Blackbird LyricsPack up all my cares and woes
Feeling low here I go
Bye bye blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar sweet so is she
Bye bye blackbird
No one seems to love or understand me
And all the hard luck stories they keep handing me
Where somebody shines the light
I'll be coming on home tonight
Bye bye blackbird
(Bye blackbird)
Bye bye blackbird
Bye bye blackbird
Nobody seems to love or understand me
And all the hard luck stories they keep on handing me
Keep on handing me
I should've have somebody hide the light
Yes, I'm coming on home tonight
Bye bye blackbirdEmbed
