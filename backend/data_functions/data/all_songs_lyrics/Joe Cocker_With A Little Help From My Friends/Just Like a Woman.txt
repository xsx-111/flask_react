Just Like a Woman LyricsNobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows
That baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And the problems from her curls
While takes just like a woman
And she makes love just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks up like a little girl
Queen mary, she's my friend
I believe I'll go and see her again
Nobody has to guess
That baby can't be blessed
Till she finds out she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and the pearls
She takes just like a woman
And she makes love just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks up like a little girl
It wasn't raining, found at first
Oh I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
Oh and your long-time curse
It hurts, but what is worse
Is this pain in here, oh I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear, oh I must admit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
And when we meet again and introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Well you take just like a woman
You make love to me like a woman
Say that you fare just like a woman
But you break up like a little girl
Breaking like a girl
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Ð¡os' you just like a little girl
I don't know what I'm gonna do with you
Hey, my little girlEmbed
