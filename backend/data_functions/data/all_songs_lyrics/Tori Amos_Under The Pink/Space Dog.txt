Space Dog Lyrics
Way to go, Mr. Microphone
Show us all what you don’t know
Centuries, secret societies
He’s our commander still, Space Dog

So sure we were on something
"Your feet are finally on the ground," he said
So sure we were on something
"Your feet are just on the ground, girl"

Rain and snow, our engines have
Been receiving your eager call
There’s Colonel Dirtyfishydishcloth
He’ll distract her good, don’t worry so

And to the one you thought was on your side
She can’t understand, she truly believes the lie

Lemon pie, he’s coming through
Our commander still, Space Dog
Lines secure, Space Dog
Deck the halls I’m young again, I’m you again
Racing turtles, the grapefruit is winning
Seems I keep getting this story
Twisted so where’s Neil when you need him?
Deck the halls it’s you again, it’s you again
Somewhere someone must know the ending
Is she still pissing in the river, now?
Heard she’d gone, moved into a trailer park

So sure we were on something
(So sure those girls now are in the Navy)
"Your feet are finally on the ground," he said
(Those bombs, our friends, can’t even hurt you now)
So sure we were on something
(And hold those tears cause they're still on your side)
"Your feet are just on the ground, girl"
(Don’t hear the dogs barking)
So sure we were on something
(Don’t say you know we’ve gone, Andromeda)
"Your feet are finally on the ground," he said
(Stood with those girls before)
So sure we were on something
(The hair in pairs it just got nasty)
"Your feet are just on the ground"
(And now those girls are gone)2Embed
