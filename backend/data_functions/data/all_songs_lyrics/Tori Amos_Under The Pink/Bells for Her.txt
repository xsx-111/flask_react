Bells for Her Lyrics
And through the life force and there goes her friend
On her Nishiki, it’s out of time
And through the portal they can make amends
Hey, would you say, "Whatever, we’re blanket friends"?

Can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t stop what’s on its way

And through the walls they made their mud pies
"I’ve got your mind," I said, she said, "I’ve your voice"
I said, "You don’t need my voice, girl, you have your own"
But you never thought it was enough of

So they went years and years
Like sisters, blanket
Blanket girls always there through, through that and this
"There’s nothing we cannot ever fix," I said

Can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t stop what’s on its way
Hey, can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t stop what’s on its way
Bells and footfalls and soldiers and dolls
Brothers and lovers she and I were
Now she seems to be sand under his shoes
There’s nothing I can do

Can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t stop what’s on its way
Can’t stop what’s coming
Can’t stop what’s on its way

And now I speak to you, are you in there
You have her face and her eyes, but you are not her
And we go at each other like blankets
Who can’t find their thread and they're bare

Can’t, can't stop loving you
Can't stop loving
Can’t stop what is on its way
And I see it coming
And it’s on its wayEmbed
