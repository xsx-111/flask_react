Yes, Anastasia Lyrics
I know what you want, the magpies have come
If you know me so well then tell me which hand I use
Make them go
Make it go

Saw her there in a restaurant, Poppy don't go
I know your mother is a good one, but Poppy don't go
I'll take you home
Show me the things I've been missing
Show me the ways I forgot to be speaking
Show me the ways to get back to the garden
Show me the ways to get around the get around
Show me the ways to
Button up buttons that have forgotten they're buttons
Well, we can't have that forgetting that
Girls, girls, what have we done?
What have we done to ourselves?
Driving on the vine, over clotheslines
But officer I saw the sign

Thought I'd been through this in 1919
Counting the tears of ten thousand men
And gathered them all, but my feet are slipping
There's something we left on the windowsill
There's something we left, yes
We'll see how brave you are
We'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
Yes, Anastasia
And all your dollies have friends

Thought she deserved no less than she'd give
Well happy birthday, her blood's on my hands
It's kind of a shame cause I did like that dress
It's funny the things that you find in the rain
The things that you find, yes

In the mall and in the date mines
In the knots still in her hair
On the bus I'm on my way down, on my way down
All the girls seem to be there

We'll see how brave you are
We'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
We'll see
We'll see how brave you are
We'll see how fast you'll be running
We'll see how brave you are
Yes, Anastasia
Come along now little darling
Come along now with me
Come along now little darling
We'll see how brave you are1Embed
