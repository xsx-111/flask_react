Daisy Dead Petals Lyrics
Daisy Dead Petals, that is her name
She's in a phone booth phase
So underneath the shade of a peppermint tray
She can turn it out with a heel on
She just rides into town knowing what they'll say
Knowing they're around the corner

Got a crack in
Got a crack in some strange places

Daisy Dead Petals, that is her name
So maybe she tastes like a hamburger maid, well
"These dead petals, honey, brought me here"
She said, "These dead petals, honey, brought me here"
Dancing on a dime hearing mother cry
Maybe she's around the corner

Got a crack in
Got a crack in some strange places
On my back with
On my back with some dirty dishes
Falling down, falling down, all over the river
Falling down, falling down, falling down
Wish what I'm feeling could go on like this forever
Falling down, falling down, falling down

And since we're down, might as well stay
Might as well fry some eggs
And wave to the shade of the peppermint tray
She's a new friend, not a skeleton
To ride into town, knowing what they'll say
Knowing she tastes like a hamburger maid

But, "These dead petals, honey, brought me here"
She said, "These dead petals, honey, brought me here"
She said, "These dead petals, honey, brought me here"Embed
