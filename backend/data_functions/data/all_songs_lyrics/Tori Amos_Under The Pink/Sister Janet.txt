Sister Janet Lyrics
Master Shaman, I have come
With my dolly from the shadow side
With a demon and an Englishman
I'm my mother, I'm my son

Nobody is slipping the blade in easy
Nobody is slipping the blade in the marmalade

But all the angels and all the wizards black and white
Are lighting candles in our hands
Can you feel them? Yes, touching hands before our eyes
And I can even see sweet Marianne

Sister Janet, you have come
From the woman clothed with the sun
Your veil is quietly becoming none
Call the wanderer, he has gone

And all those up there are making it look so easy
With your perfect wings, a wing can cover all sorts of things
And all the angels and all the wizards black and white
Are lighting candles in our hands
Can you feel them? Yes, touching hands before our eyes
And I can even see sweet Marianne

Hey, yes, this again
Well, I think I could try this once againEmbed
