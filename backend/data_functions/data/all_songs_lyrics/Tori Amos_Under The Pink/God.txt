God Lyrics
God sometimes you just don’t come through
God sometimes you just don’t come through
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through

You make pretty daisies, pretty daisies love
(Come down and tell me what you mean, now)
I’ve gotta find, find, find what you’re doing about things here
(Huh, whatcha doing?)
A few witches burning, gets a little toasty here
(Hey now, what do you know, what do you know)
I gotta find, find, find why you always go when the wind blows

God sometimes you just don’t come through
God sometimes you just don’t come through, babe
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through

Well, tell me you’re crazy maybe then I’ll understand
(Come down and tell me what you mean, now)
You got your 9, 9 iron in the back seat just in case
(Huh, whatcha doing?)
Heard you’ve gone south, well, babe you love your new 4-wheel
(Hey now, what do you know, what do you know)
I gotta find, find, find why you always go when the wind blows
“Give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings”

Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky fall?
Will you even tell her if you decide to make the sky..?

God sometimes you just don’t come through
God sometimes you just don’t come through, babe
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through
Do you need a woman to look after you?
God sometimes you just don’t come through1Embed
