The Waitress Lyrics
So I want to kill this waitress
She’s worked here a year longer than I
If I did it fast you know, that’s an act of kindness

But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace

I want to kill this waitress
I can’t believe this violence in mind
And is her power all in a club sandwich

But I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I believe in peace
I believe in peace, bitch
I believe in peace
I want to kill this killing wish
There’re too many stars and not enough sky
Boys all think she's living kindness
Ask a fellow waitress
Ask a fellow waitress1Embed
