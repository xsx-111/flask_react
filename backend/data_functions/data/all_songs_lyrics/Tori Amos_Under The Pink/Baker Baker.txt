Baker Baker Lyrics
Baker, baker baking a cake
Make me a day, make me whole again
And I wonder what’s in a day
What’s in your cake this time?

I guess you heard he’s gone to LA
He says that behind my eyes I’m hiding
And he tells me I pushed him away
That my heart's been hard to find

Here, there must be something here
There must be something here, here

Baker, baker can you explain
If truly his heart was made of icing
And I wonder how mine could taste
Maybe we could change his mind

I know you’re late for your next parade
You came to make sure that I’m not running
Well I ran from him in all kinds of ways
Guess it was his turn this time
Time, thought I’d made friends with time
Thought we’d be flying, maybe not this time

Baker, baker baking a cake
Make me a day, make me whole again
And I wonder if he’s okay
If you see him say, "Hi"1Embed
