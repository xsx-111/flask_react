Cornflake Girl Lyrics
Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution
Hanging with the raisin girls
She's gone to the other side
Giving us a yo-heave-ho
Things are getting kind of gross
And I go at sleepy time

This is not really, this, a-this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

She knows what's going on
Seems we got a cheaper feel now
All the sweeteaze are gone
Gone to the other side
With my encyclopedia
They musta paid her a nice price
She's putting on her string bean love
This is not really, this, this
This is not really happening

You bet your life it is
You bet your life it is
Oh honey, you bet your life
It's a peel out the watchword
Just peel out the watchword

Never was a cornflake girl
Thought that was a good solution

Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
A-ha, rabbit, where'd you put the keys?
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys
Where'd you put the keys, girl?

And the man with the golden gun
(Don't close this door)
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
(I know it's so easy)
And the man with the golden gun
(Don't close this door)
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
(I know it's so easy)
And the man with the golden gun
(Don't close this door)
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
(I know it's so easy)
And the man with the golden gun
(Don't close this door)
Thinks he knows so much
Thinks he knows so much, yeah
(I know it's so easy)
Yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
Oh yes, rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?
All this time, rabbit, where'd you put the keys, oh yeah
Rabbit, where'd you put the keys girl?11Embed
