The Wrong Band Lyrics
I think it's perfectly clear - we're in the wrong band
Ginger is always sincere, just not to one man
She called me up and she said, "You know that I'm drowning"
It's the dog trainer again
He says that he thinks that she needs more hands

I think it's perfectly clear - we're in the wrong band
Senator, let's be sincere as much as you can
He called her up and he said, "The new prosecutor
Soon will be wanting a word"
So she's got a soft spot for heels and spurs

And there's something believing in her voice again
Said there's something believing
Instead of just leaving, instead of just leaving, instead of just leaving
And she gets her cigars from the sweet fat man

I think it's perfectly clear - we're in the wrong band
Heidi says she'll be sincere as much as she can
I called her up and I said, "You know that I'm drowning
Put on your raincoat again
'Cause even the sun's got a price on it"
And there's something believing in her voice again
Said there's something believing
Instead of just leaving, instead of just leaving, instead of just leaving
She said it's time I open my eyes, don't be afraid to open your eyes
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's right
Maybe she's rightEmbed
