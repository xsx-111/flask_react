Icicle Lyrics
Icicle, icicle, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Icicle, icicle, where are you going?
I have a hiding place when Spring marches in
Will you keep watch for me? I hear them calling

Gonna lay down
Gonna lay down

Greeting the monster in our Easter dresses
Father says, "Bow your head like the Good Book says"
Well, I think the Good Book is missing some pages

Gonna lay down
Gonna lay down

And when my hand touches myself
I can finally rest my head
And when they say, "Take of his body"
I think I'll take from mine instead
Getting off, getting off
While they're all downstairs
Singing prayers, sing away
He's in my pumpkin pj's
Lay your book on my chest
Feel the word, feel the word
Feel the word, feel the word
Feel the word, feel it
I could have, I should have
I could have flown, you know?
I could have, I should have
I didn't, so...
Icicle, icicle, where are you going?
I have a hiding place when Spring marches in
Will you keep watch for me? I hear them calling

Gonna lay down
Gonna lay down
Lay down
I'm gonna lay down1Embed
