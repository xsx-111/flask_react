Black Swan Lyrics
Ride on, ride on
Friends of the black swan
Ride on, ride on
Do you know where she's gone?

Gumdrops and Saturdays
Did Eric call by the way?
He knew, he knew
And he knew where the pillow goes

Ride on, ride on
Friends of the black swan
Ride on, ride on
You know where she's gone

Buttercups and the fishing flies
The biggest thickest ever sky
I know they know something
I know

Ride on, ride on now
Friends of the black swan
Ride on, ride on
You know where she's gone
Little green men do okay
"It's the fairies' revenge," they say
Gumdrops and Saturdays
Did Eric call, by the way?

Ride on, ride on
Friends of the black swan
Ride on, ride on
You know where she's gone

Ride on
Ride on
Ride onEmbed
