Honey Lyrics
A little dust never stopped me none
He liked my shoes, I kept them on
Sometimes I can hold my tongue and sometimes not
When you just skip-to-loo, my darling
And you know what you're doing so don't even

You're just too used to my honey now
You're just too used to my honey

And I think I could leave your world
If she was the better girl
So when we died I tried to bribe the undertaker
'Cause I'm not sure what you're doing or the reasons

You're just too used to my honey now
You're just too used to my honey
You're just too used to my honey now

Don't bother coming down
I made a friend of the western sky
Oh, don't bother coming down
You always liked your babies tight
Turn back one last time
Love to watch those cowboys ride
But cowboys know cowgirls ride on the Indian side
And you know what you're doing so don't even

You're just too used to my honey now
You're just too used to my honey
You're just too used to my honey now
You're just too used to my honeyEmbed
