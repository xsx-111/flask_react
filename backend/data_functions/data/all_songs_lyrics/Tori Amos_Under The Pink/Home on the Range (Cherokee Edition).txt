Home on the Range (Cherokee Edition) Lyrics
Oh, give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
Where the dear and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And skies are not cloudy all day


Jackson made deals
A thief down to his heels
Hello trail of tears
The Smokies could hide
A Cherokee bride
Her brave was shot yesterday

Home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And skies are not cloudy all day
We know it's not Caroline
Your home is your home
The range may be fine
For some but not in my eyes

Home on the range
The Smokies always hide
Cherokee bride
But in their eyes we know it's not Caroline

Yeah, here, America
Here, America
Who discovered your ass?
The white man came
"This land is my land, this is your land," they say

Home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard
A discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day
And the skies are not cloudy all day
And the skies are not cloudy all dayEmbed
