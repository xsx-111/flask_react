Call Me Animal Lyrics
I take a laser beam
And I use it like a stone axe, baby
I take the present, past and future, mama
And blast it out my thorax

Call me animal, that's my name
Call me animal, I'm not ashamed
Call me animal, this is your hour
Call me animal, you've got the power

I use the juju of my ancestors
To drive this piece of meat
I scream the music of the Pleistocene
Just because it's got a good beat

Call me animal, that's my name
Call me animal, I'm not ashamed
Call me animal, this is your hour
Call me animal, you've got the power
Animal
Animal
Animal
Animal
Call me animal, that's my name
Call me animal, I'm not ashamed
Call me animal, this is your hour
Call me animal, you've got the power
Animal
Animal
