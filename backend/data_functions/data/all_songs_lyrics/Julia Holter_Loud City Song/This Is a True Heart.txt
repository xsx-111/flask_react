This Is a True Heart LyricsThere's just no room for all our thoughts
Come on, let's walk another walk
Did you ever see a downtown businessman sing a joyful talk
In a suit made out of song?
Come, let's not insist on love
We're just alive
Let's talk straight about it and sled through the boulevard
This is a true heart
Listen hard
These are true words
Speak hard
See the young — so old so fast
I don't understand
Falling leaves
A tree's a tree
See the young — so old so fast
I don't understand
Falling leaves (I don't understand)1Embed
