World LyricsHeaven
All the heavens of the world
Are you looking for anything?
Heaven with eyes bright green
Every day my eyes are older
I grow a bit closer to you
Hats
All the hats of the world
I don’t know how I wear a hat so much
Even when I run
The city can’t see my eyes
Under the brim
I play a game of tennis
Passing violins are blind
Mother
Oh, mothers of the world
A singer with eyes closed
Singer on the 5th floor
Your hats that I wear when you disappear
How could you see that every day I talk to you?
Mister
All the misters of the world
Whose cello are you looking for?
How can it escape?
City
All the cities of the world
What are you wearing?
I live on the 5th floor of the apartment building
What am I looking for in you?
How can I escape you?1Embed
