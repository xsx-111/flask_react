City Appearing LyricsSo
In this late hour
Maybe trouble
Maybe fantasy
It's too hot for winter
Patience, violent heart
Bright blue flames under my fingers
I'm taken by surprise
Taken through the city
Storm on my back
It is the hand of love so rough
What we're feeling for the first time?
Does Claire love too, or Julie? Do they love?
When Lis feels the way I do
Can I feel her percuss through the city?
Through the city
All the phones are ringing with the restaurant's complaint
Even the regular customers have left early tonight
Ran out without a hat
Everyone has left early without a hat
A fire without a hat
All the birds of the world make their way over
With new softer songs to sing
The moon is true
Maxim's on fire
Gigi swimming
I see my love swimming
Moon, you know disaster from a warm bath
All who are muffled by the squall
Doesn't love scare them?
Screamers on the balconies
Soldiers on the roofs
Trombones on the roofs
The screamers who fell in love or died
