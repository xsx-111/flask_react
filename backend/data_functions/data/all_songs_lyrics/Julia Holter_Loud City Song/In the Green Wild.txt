In the Green Wild LyricsCity shoes found ways down green fertile valleys
See I never could fall down straight in line so sure
Someone with a thing to say writes on a leaf and lets it fall onto my feet
I receive the news so small a child who cannot understand
I can't hear and I don't know
And the wind slows down so
Still a tree's a tree!
So calm and for a moment it makes sense
But the tree says "wa, wa"
And the language is strange the woman's "wa, wa"
"Wa, wa"
And the language is strange the woman's "wa, wa"
Am I too bored to understand?
Well good, I'm done
Off to the wild for me
In the green wild I am gone
My hands, toes, shoulders gone
But the shoes my feet have worn still remain
And they walk toward the sea
There's a flavor to the sound of walking no one ever noticed before
In the green wild I am gone
My hands, toes, shoulders gone
But the shoes my feet have worn still remain
And they walk toward the sea
There's a flavor to the sound of walking no one ever noticed before
In the green wild I am gone
My hands, toes, shoulders gone
But the shoes my feet have worn still remain
And they walk toward the sea
There's a flavor to the sound of walking no one ever noticed before
There's a humor in the way they walk
Even a flower walks
But doesn't look for me
It walks just as it's grown
It's laughing so naturally
It tells me a tree's a tree1Embed
