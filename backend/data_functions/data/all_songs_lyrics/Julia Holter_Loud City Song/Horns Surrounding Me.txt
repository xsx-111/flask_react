Horns Surrounding Me LyricsFew times do I feel the breeze
Of a cold night
So I recall the words of lovers sadly in the sun
Unending sun:
"We will run forever with the hot timpani bang"
Bang!
As the sound recedes, bored lover falls asleep and disappears
Horns surrounding me
Sing so forcefully and high
Horns surrounding me
Sing so forcefully and high
Moon, they forget how soft heart is
Unfolding over time
Heart, don't forget how young we are
We wander softly
Horns surrounding me
Sing so forcefully and high
Moon, they forget how soft heart is
Unfolding over time
Heart, don't forget how young we are
We wander softly
Seen through a window, my love blurred
Mute and slow
I offer roses to nothing
