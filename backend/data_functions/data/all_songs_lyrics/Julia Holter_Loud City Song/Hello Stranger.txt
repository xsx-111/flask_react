Hello Stranger Lyrics(It seems like a mighty long time)
(It seems like a mighty long time)
Hello stranger
It seems so good to see you back again
How long has it been?
It seems like a mighty long time
My baby, ooh
It seems like a mighty long time
Oh, my, I’m so glad
You stopped by to say hello to me
Remember that’s the way it used to be
It seems like a mighty long time
My baby, ooh
It seems like a mighty long time
Yes, I’m so glad you’re here again
Oh (it seems like a mighty long time)
If you’re not gonna stay
Please don’t tease me like you did before
Because I still love you so
It seems like a mighty long time
My baby, ooh
It seems like a mighty long time
(It seems like a mighty long time)
(It seems like a mighty long time)
Oh, oh my, my, my
I’m so happy you're here again
(It seems like a mighty long time)
(It seems like a mighty long time)1Embed
