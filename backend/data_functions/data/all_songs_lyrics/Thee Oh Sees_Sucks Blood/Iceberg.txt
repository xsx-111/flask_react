Iceberg LyricsIceberg
Blue in the path
A killer's cape
Long and flat
As of lately
I've been dreamin this
Cold hands
Blue on my path
It's summertime
Don't let it pass
As of lately
I've been dreaming of
Iceberg
And make it for free
Finish fruits
A dot on the sea
As of lately
I've been dreaming thisEmbed
