It Killed Mom LyricsIt killed mom to see me with
A gun and, oh my god
My mom was not the only one
To see me with my head
Undone and, oh my god
The bang, my life is violent
In these walls and ceilings with
Rejection, oh my god
The miss was likely a big, big mess
To see me with my head
Undone and, oh my god
The bang, my life is violentEmbed
