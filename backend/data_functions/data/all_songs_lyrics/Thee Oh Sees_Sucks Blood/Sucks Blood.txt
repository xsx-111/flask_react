Sucks Blood LyricsHigh over trees 
Crackling like they do
So do I, and so do you
Cracks and chasms, flipped foundation
Leveled homes, as they will
So do I, and so do you
Freeze a lake, forget the fishes
Craft a line, as they do
So do I, and so do you
Topple towers, blasting holes
, as they go
So do I, and so do you1Embed
