Must Be Dreaming Lyrics
Pay close attention
Don't listen to me from now
George'll be flying this one
And it's anyone's guess how he does
This is the right turn, wrong universe
And taking me in full bloom
Fireball, careful with that there
See what you made me do?

I must be dreaming or
We're on to something
I must be dreaming for
I don't fall in love lawlessly
I must be dreaming or
Pinch me to waking
So undeniably yours
As long as I'm losing it so completely

Incendiary glance
Become and collide in me
Zoom in, enhance
Hold while I go helplessly
Sky high, magic eye
Sugar rushing, don't stop
I must be dreaming or
We're onto something
Hey, just what d'you make me for?
I don't fall in love lawlessly
I must be dreaming or
Pinch me to waking
So undeniably yours
As long as I'm losing it so completely

Euphoria
I can't take, any more of you
Euphoria
I can't take, any more of you
I'm losing it

I must be dreaming or
We're onto something
Hey, just what d'you make me for?
I don't fall in love lawlessly
I must be dreaming or
Pinch me to waking
So undeniably yours
As long as I'm losing
I'm losing it
I'm losing it here
I'm losing it
I'm losing it here
I must be dreaming
I'm losing it here
I must be dreaming
I'm losing it here

I must be dreaming1Embed
