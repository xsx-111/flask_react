Hear Me Out Lyrics
I'm not over you
I'm not over you
I'm not over you
I'm not over you

I join the queue on your answer phone
And all I am is holding breath
Just pick up, I know you're there
Can't you hear? I'm not myself
Oh, go ahead and lie to me
You could say anything, small talk will be just fine
Your voice is everything, we owe it to love
And it all depends on you

So listen up, this sun hasn't set
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling
Just hear me out: I'm not over you yet
It's love on the line, can you handle it?

So how do I do normal?
The smile I fake, the permanent wave of
Cue cards and fix-it kits
Can't you tell? I'm not myself
I'm a slow motion accident
Lost in coffee rings and fingerprints
I don't wanna feel anything, but I do
And it all comes back to you
So listen up, this sun hasn't set
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling
Just hear me out: I'm not over you yet
It's love on the line, can you handle it?

So listen up, look at me straight
Just hear me out, don't make me wait
I'm not myself, I can't take this
Love's on the line, is that your final answer?

I join the queue on your answer phone
And all I am is holding breath
Just pick up, I know you're there

So listen up, this sun hasn't set
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling
Just hear me out: I'm not over you yet
It's love on the line, can you handle it?

So listen up, this sun hasn't set
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling
Just hear me out: I'm not over you
It's love on the line, can you handle it?
So listen up, this sun hasn't set
I refuse to believe that it's only me feeling
Just hear me out: I'm not over you yet
It's love on the line, can you handle it?1Embed
