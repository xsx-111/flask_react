Shh Lyrics
Sunbeam, stop tugging me
Pull that door shut quietly
Darling, what are you doing?
We don't have time for this
I'm crazy, well what are you then?
Give me an hour and I'll give you your dream

Don't make a sound
Ssh, and listen
Keep your head down
We're not safe yet
Don't make a sound
And be good for me
'Cause I know they're waiting
Somewhere out here

Leave it, I won't go back
We have to do it 'cause there's nothing left here
Don't care, what do they know?
I've seen it, baby, and I know it's real
Showtime, I knew they'd come
Whoa, are we having fun or what? Yeah
Don't make a sound
Ssh, and listen
Keep your head down
We're not safe yet
Don't make a sound
And be good for me
'Cause I know they're waiting
Somewhere out...

Don't make a sound
Ssh, and listen
Keep your head down
We're not safe yet
Don't make a sound
And be good for me
'Cause I know they're waiting
Somewhere out here


I feel good all over
I feel good all over
I feel good all over
Wear your inside out

Inside out
Inside out
Inside out, out, out, out, out
Inside out, out, out, outEmbed
