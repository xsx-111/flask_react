Maddening Shroud Lyrics
Sometimes I like to get away from this maddening shroud
Sometimes, I'll have you know, it's all insane

Maybe it's time for me to pack it in
Maybe it's time for me to jack it in
Maybe it's time for me to halt

I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away, throw it all away
I've got a good mind to throw it all away
After all, what is it worth?

Sometimes I like to get away from the saddening crowd
Sometimes I feel my life is all in vain

Maybe it's time for me to pack it in
Maybe it's time for me to jack it in
Maybe it's time for me to halt

I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away, throw it all away
I've got a good mind to throw it all away
After all, what is it worth?
Some days my strength walks out
Some days I can't go on
It is for real, we can walk about
We can work it over and over and over and over and over and...

I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away, throw it all away
I've got a good mind to throw it all away
After all, what is it worth?

I've got a good mind to throw it all away
Throw it all away, simply throw it all away
I've got a good mind to throw it all away
After all, what is it worth?1Embed
