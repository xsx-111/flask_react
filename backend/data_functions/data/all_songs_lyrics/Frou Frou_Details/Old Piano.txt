Old Piano Lyrics
What's that you're saying there? Oh well
Rain rushing, window pane, oh well
Not sure what space I'm in, oh well
But I'm safe inside me here, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well


What's that you're saying there? Oh well
Rain rushing, window pane, oh well
Not sure what space I'm in, oh well
But I'm safe inside me here, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well

Lying here, lie, lie, lie, lie
Lying here, lie
Lying here, lie, lie, lie
Lying here, lie
Lying here, lie, lie, lie
Lying here, lie
Lying here, lie, lie, lie
Lying here, lie1Embed
