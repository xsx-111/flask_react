Let Go Lyrics
Drink up, baby doll
Mmm, are you in or are you out?
Leave your things behind
'Cause it's all going off without you

Excuse me, too busy?
Oh, writing your tragedy
These mishaps you bubble wrap
When you've no idea what you're like

So let go, let go
Jump in
Oh well, whatcha waiting for?
It's alright
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So let go, yeah, let go
Just get in
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's alright
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown

It gains the more it gives
And then it rises with the fall
So hand me that remote
Can't you see that all that stuff's a sideshow
Such boundless pleasure
We've no time for later now
You can't await your own arrival
You've twenty seconds to comply

So let go, so let go
Jump in
Oh well, whatcha waiting for?
It's alright
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So let go, yeah, let go
Just get in
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's alright
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown


So let go
Mmm, jump in
Oh well, whatcha waiting for?
It's all right
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
So let go, yeah, let go
Just get in
Oh, it's so amazing here
It's alright
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown

Mmm, the breakdown
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown
Hey, the breakdown
So amazing here
'Cause there's beauty in the breakdown11Embed
