Flicks Lyrics
Lung of love leaves me breathless
Tongue of fool, lap me in enmity
Four-walled secret lies among the hessian
And a flicker of the future could've saved the cindered sister

And I'm motioning still, they stand inside me
And moments until the one I leave

Colourless I kiss her cold forehead, I feel life
Lose it in a minute and the ones to come feel too far to care

And I'm motioning still, they stand inside me
And moments until the one I leave

People concertina to my private magic lantern move for me
With the senses all inclusive in the theatre of triggered memories


I'm motioning still, they stand inside me
And moments until the one I leave
I'm motioning still, they stand inside me
And moments until the one I leave
And moments until the one I leave
The one I leave, the one I leave
The one I leave, motioning still
The one I leaveEmbed
