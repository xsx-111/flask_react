Only Got One Lyrics
If this is a question, is "maybe" a lie?
If "yes" doesn't mean it, does "when" lessen "why"?
You are held in a queue
Someone will be with you shortly
Say I'm wrong, you decide
I don't believe the words you sing sometimes

But then it's your life
Mhm, it's your life
But then it's your life
Mhm, it's your life
But you've only got one
You've only got one
But you've only got one

If I, just to spite you, placate your disgrace
Will song turn to silence? Will mask wear your face?
Are you down to be open?
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Or are you down just to be down?
I don't believe the words you sing sometimes

But then it's your life
Mhm, it's your life
But then it's your life
Mhm, it's your life
But you've only got one
But then it's your life
Mhm, it's your life
You've only got one
Mhm, it's your life
But you've only got one

Life
You've only got one
Life
But you've only got one
Life
You started it
Life
You started it
But you've only got one
Life
You started it
But you've only got one
Life
You started it
But you've only got one
Life
You started it
But you've only got one
Life
But you've only got one
Life
But you've only got one
Life
But you've only got one
Mhm, you've only got one
But you've only got oneEmbed
