The Dumbing Down of Love Lyrics
Well-painted passion
You rightly suspect
Impersonation
The dumbing down of love
Jaded in anger
Love underwhelms you
No box of chocolates
Whichever way you fall

And if I tell you, lover alone without love
What will happen, lover alone without love?
Will you listen, lover alone without, without love?

No, no, I'll get this
I want to treat you
You're still not famous
And you haven't struck it rich
Underachieving
'Cause no one's receiving
This tunnel vision
It's turning out all wrong

And if I tell you, lover alone without love
What will happen, lover alone without love?
Will you listen, lover alone without, without love?
Music is worthless unless it can
Make a complete stranger
Break down and cry

And if I tell you, lover alone without love
What will happen, lover alone without love?
Will you listen, lover alone without, without love?

Without love
Without love, yeah1Embed
