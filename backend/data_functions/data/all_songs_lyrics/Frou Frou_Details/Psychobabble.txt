Psychobabble Lyrics
How did you get this number?
I can't get my head 'round you
Of course you're not coming over
Snap out of it
You're not making any sense

You couldn't be more wrong, darling
I never gave out these signs
You misunderstand all meaning
Snap out of it
I'm not falling for this one

If love is surrender
Then whose war is it anyway?

Do just what I tell you
And no one will get hurt
Don't come in any closer
'Cause I dunno how long I can hold my heart in two

If you think that it's so damn easy
Then what do you need me for?
Just look at the state of you, babe
Snap out of it
You're not listening to this
And just for once could you
Let me finish a sentence?

Do just what I tell you
And no one will get hurt
Don't come in any closer
'Cause I dunno how long I can hold my heart in two

Make no, make no sudden movements
And no one need get hurt
You're making me nervous
If you knew what was good for me why would I be loving you?


Now, I've had it up to here
Don't ever try that again
Why are you so quiet so suddenly?
Go on, have it
You're just dying to try me

Do just what I tell you
And no one will get hurt
Don't come in any closer
'Cause I dunno how long I can hold my heart in two
Make no, make no sudden movements
And no one need get hurt
You're making me nervous
If you knew what was good for me why would I be loving you?

So, what do we do now?
So, what do we do now?
So, what do we do now?
So, what do we do now?2Embed
