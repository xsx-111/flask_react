Cassavetes LyricsShut up!
Shut up! This is my last picture!
Shot in real, real, realism!
Oh!
Crush my calm, you Cassavetes
Sitting tight so quiet - quiet
In the dark till the lights came up
Heart beating like a riot - riot
Hollywood are you waiting on a sign
Someone to come on bust a genre
You poor city of shame
Ask me what you're needing and I'll sell you his name
'Cos he was the one to send out, send it with truth
That's something from someone
Gena Rowlands
Complete control, for Cassavetes
If it's not for sale you can't buy it - buy it
Sad-eyed mogul reaching for your wallet
Like hand to holster why don't you try it - try it
Are you waiting on a sign
Someone to come on bust a genre
You poor city of shame
Ask me what you're needing and I'll front you his name
'Cos he was the one to send out, send it with truth
That's something from someone
Gena Rowlands
Yeah
Oh, Shut up! This is my last picture!
Shot in real, real, realism!
Shut up! Shut up!
This is my last pictureEmbed
