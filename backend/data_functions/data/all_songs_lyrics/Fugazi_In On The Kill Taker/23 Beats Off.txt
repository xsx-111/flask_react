23 Beats Off LyricsA name
I recognise that name
It was at the center
Of some ticker tape parade
The lead story
A fine example
A name
A name
A name
I recognise that name
It was at the center
Of some magnifying glass
The lead story
A fine example
A name
He used to pretend
He was fighting some war somewhere
Now everything depends
On fighting some war
He never thought he'd be an
Exclamation point
A demonstration of his disease
A punctuation mark
A household name with HIV
Still, it's just still
