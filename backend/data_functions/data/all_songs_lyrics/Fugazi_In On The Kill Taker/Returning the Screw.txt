Returning the Screw LyricsFine disservice
Deceptive, too
Check for the sender
Sender was you
Caught me wide open
No simple burn
This is complicated
Calls for return
Fine disservice
Intended, too
Check for the sender
Sender was you
The point has been recorded
The malice has been revealed
When I stripped away the humour
From the arrow that it concealed
Sharpened, soaked in urine, it was
Meant to spread disease
But now discovered becomes
The sweet antithesis
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
Returning the screw
It comes back to youEmbed
