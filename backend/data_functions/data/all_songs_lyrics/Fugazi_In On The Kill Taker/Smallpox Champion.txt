Smallpox Champion LyricsSmallpox Champion U S of A
Give natives some blankets warm like the grave
This is the pattern cut from the cloth
This is the pattern designed to take you right out
Right out, right out, right out, right out, right out
Right out, right out, right out, right out, right out, right out
This is the frontier with winters so cold
Greed informs action where action makes bold
To take all the cotton that's cut from the stalk
Weave in the disease that's gonna wipe you right out
Right out, right out, right out, right out, right out
Right out, right out, right out, right out, right out, right out
What is good for the future
What was good for the past
What is good for the future
Won't last
What is good for the future
What was good for the past
What is good for the future
Won't last
Bury your heart U S of A
History rears up to spit in your face
You saw what you wanted, you took what you saw
We know how you got it, your method equals wipe out
Wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out
Wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out
The end of the frontier and all that you own
Under the blankets of all that you've done
Memory serves us to serve you yet
Memory serves us to never let you wipe out
Wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out
Wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out, wipe out
What is good for the future
What was good for the past
What is good for the future
Won't last
What is good for the future
What was good for the past
What is good for the future
Won't last
