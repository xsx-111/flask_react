Last Chance for a Slow Dance LyricsCoughing
Inside your coffin
Like at the bottom
Of the sea
Inside you're breathing
Too numb for asking
So I will leave it
Outside your door
Warning
The threat of morning
That just extends you
Another day
Some lights were shining
Not much for seeing
But you'll be leaving
The way you came
Shot shooting
Shot shot
Shot shooting yourself again for what?
To taste all the waste
Shot shooting
Shot shot
Shot shooting yourself again for what?
To taste all the waste
Flare
Flare flakes a flower
A burnt-out shower
No one can see
You were needing
Too shy for asking
So I will leave it
Outside your door
Pulse stalls
Uncut but clotted
When you had thought it
Would force a flow
Some lights were shining
Not much for seeing
But you believe in
The way you came
Shot shooting
Shot shot
Shot shooting yourself again for what?
To taste all the waste
Shot shooting
Shot shot
Shot shooting yourself again for what?
To taste all the waste
