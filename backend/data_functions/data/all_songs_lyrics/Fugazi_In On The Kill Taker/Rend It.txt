Rend It LyricsWhy don't you come to my house?
Why don't you drag me right out?
Past all the shit that I said, I'm saying
Why don't you cut up my mouth?
And I don't care what you use
Just don't ask me to choose
I forced a field to allow you
That's not so easy to do
I said, I said what I said
I want you to help me
(Oh) Surrender, rend it, it's yours
Out in the open
We're wide open
(Oh) Surrender, rend it, it's yours
Locked in a body
In love with the process of...
Surrender, rend it, it's yours
Out in the open
We're wide open
Night light comes into my room
Some shade of bruise-colored blue
Moves through my mind like a chemical
Imbalance on schedule
My tasting face to the floor
Passive abject I'm sure
I lick my lips when I need it
Don't want to lick them no more
I said, I said what I said
I want you to help me
(Oh) Surrender, rend it, it's yours
Out in the open
We're wide open
(Oh) Surrender, rend it, it's yours
Locked in a body
In love with the process of...
Surrender, rend it, it's yours
Out in the open
We're wide open
(Surrender, rend it, it's yours)
(Yours, yours)
(Yours, yours)
