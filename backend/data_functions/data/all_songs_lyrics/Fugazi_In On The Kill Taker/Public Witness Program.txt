Public Witness Program LyricsThe eyes have it and the eyes always will
The eyes have it and they're watching you still
You'll see, you'll see tonight
I'll be watching cause I want you tonight
All right
Public witness charter - look but don't touch
Public witness says he's seeing too much
You'll see, you'll see tonight
I'll be looking cause I want you tonight
All right
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand, to stand around
Can I get a witness
A witness with ears
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
I like to walk around it
I'm paid to stand around it
Public witness seen it all1Embed
