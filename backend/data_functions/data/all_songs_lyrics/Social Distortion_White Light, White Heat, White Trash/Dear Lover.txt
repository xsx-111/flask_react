Dear Lover LyricsYeah loving, over and over again now
It ain't nothing girl
Till you've felt the pain
Up against the wall
Why does love always have to hurt
Your scratches run across my back and then a tear
Chorus:
Dear lover
I can't take the pain no more
Dear lover
I pick my heart up from the floor
Dear lover
I can't believe its come to this
Dear lover
Give me one last painful kiss
There ain't nothin'
In this world for free now
So how high of a price will you pay
Hear the screams so loud
Wake up to the broken glass
It's a scene from bad to worse
And many more tears
Choursx2
One last kiss, one last kiss, one last kissEmbed
