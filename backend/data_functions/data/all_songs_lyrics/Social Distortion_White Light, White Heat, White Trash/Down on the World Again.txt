Down on the World Again LyricsThis ain't the way it's supposed to be
There's a dark cloud following me
I'm disillusioned and I'm down on the world again
There's movies going on in my head
And all I can see is the color red
I'm relentless and I'm down on the world again
Give me tomorrow's broken dreams now
I'm feeling like a loaded gun
There's a world of guilt written on my face
And I feel ashamed for the human race
I've been forsaken and I'm down on the world again
I feel so alone in this crowd
My thoughts of despair are getting loud
I'm disrespected and I'm down on the world again
Love and tolerance have abandoned me
And I feel the gloom hovering over me
I'm resentful and I'm down on the world again
Give me tomorrow's broken dreams now
I'm feeling like a loaded gun
Give me tomorrow's holy schemes now
So hopeless when there's no place left to run
I try to blame all the higher stakes
You won't let me forget my mistakes
I'm unforgiven and I'm down on the world again
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
There's a dark cloud following me
I'm distorted and I'm down on the world againEmbed
