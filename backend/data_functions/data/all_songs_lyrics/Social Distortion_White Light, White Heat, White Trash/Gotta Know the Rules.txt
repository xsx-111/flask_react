Gotta Know the Rules LyricsSpent my whole life yeah lookin' for something
What it was I'm not really sure
I looked for happiness but only found sorrow
Then I realized how to unlock the door yeah yeah yeah
So you think you've got it figured out
It don't come easy maybe just for fools
Some say life is a struggle now it's a game now
Just gotta know the rules
Gotta know the rules
Most people go through life thinking
Take what you can and leave the weak behind
Never stop to think what you can give now
Too afraid to learn what you might find yeah yeah yeah
So you think you've got it figured out
It don't come easy maybe just for fools
Some say life is a struggle now it's a game now
Just gotta know the rules
Gotta know the rules
Spent my whole life yeah doing things my way
Doing unto others knowing it's wrong
When's the last time you looked in the mirror?
When's the last time you liked what you saw?
Yeah yeah yeah
So you think you've got it figured out
It don't come easy maybe just for fools
Some say life is a struggle now it's a game now
Just gotta know the rules
Gotta know the rulesEmbed
