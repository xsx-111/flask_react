I Was Wrong LyricsWhen I was young, I was so full of fear
I hid behind anger, and held back the tears
It was me against the world; I was sure I would win
But the world fought back; punished me for my sins
Well, I felt so alone; so insecure
But I blamed you instead; made sure I was heard
They tried to warn me of my evil ways
But I couldn't hear what they had to say
I was wrong..
Self-destruction's got me again
I was wrong...
I realize now that I was wrong
And I think about my loves; well, I've had a few
I'm sorry that I hurt them; did I hurt you too?
Well, I took what I wanted; put my heart on the shelf
But how can you love when you don't love yourself?
It was me against the world; I was sure that I'd win
But the world fought back; punished me for my sins
They tried to warn me of my evil way
But I couldn't hear what they had to say
I was wrong..
Self-destruction's got me again
I was wrong...
I realize now that I was wrong
I was wrong...
I was wrong...
Well, I grew up fast, and I grew up hard
Something was wrong from the very start
I was fighting everybody; I was fighting everything
But the only one that I hurt was me
I got society's blood running down my face
Somebody help me get out of this place
How could someones bad luck last so long
Until I realized that I was wrongEmbed
