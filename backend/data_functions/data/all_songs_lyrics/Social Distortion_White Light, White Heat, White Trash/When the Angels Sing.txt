When the Angels Sing Lyrics
At last we meet again, dear God
Hear the angels sing
The funerals are nicer, when we know you're there
When the angels sing
Sometimes I try so hard
To understand the things you do
Who am I to question You
When it all comes down
Hear the angels sing?

Stand up strong
Feel the pain
When the angels sing
Love and Death
Don't mean a thing
'Til the angels sing

The prisoners pray when they're on Death Row
Hear the angels sing
The junkie cries for love, but its all run out
When the angels sing
The sins of the world
And it's cold on the streets
When you're all alone
And the tears they start to fall
When it all comes down
Hear the angels sing
Stand up strong
Feel the pain
When the angels sing
Love and death
Don't mean a thing
'Til the angels sing
Little by little
Day by day
I watch the children play
'Cause life and death
Don't mean a thing
'Til the angels sing

When the angel of death
Comes looking for me
Hear the angels sing
I hope I was everything
I was supposed to be
When the angels sing;
There's gotta be a heaven
'Cause I've already done
My time in hell
And a little baby's born
When it all comes down;
Hear the angels sing
Stand up strong
Feel the pain
When the angels sing
Love and death
Don't mean a thing
'Till the angels sing
Little by little
Day by day
I watch the children play
'Cause life and death
Don't mean a thing
'Til the angels singEmbed
