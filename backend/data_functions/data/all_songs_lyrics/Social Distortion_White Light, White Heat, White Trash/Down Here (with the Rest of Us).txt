Down Here (with the Rest of Us) LyricsYou work hard now
To put the food on the table
You're working for the men
Who don't even know your name
That's the way that it goes
When you're down here with the rest of us
You might lose now
Your beautiful children
Your happy home, yeah
And your beautiful wife
That's the way that it goes
When you're down here with the rest of us
You'll suffer hard now
As you bury your loved ones
You'll suffer hard now
When you lose your best friend
That's the way that it goes
When you're down here with the rest of us
That's the way that it goes
And I know how you feel
No one's immune now
To a world of problems
No one's exempt now
From a world of pain
That's the way that it goes
When you're down here with the rest of us
I try hard now
To do the right thing
Yet I wonder
Why I still do what's wrong
That's the way that it goes
When you're down here with the rest of us
That's the way that it goes
And I know how you feelEmbed
