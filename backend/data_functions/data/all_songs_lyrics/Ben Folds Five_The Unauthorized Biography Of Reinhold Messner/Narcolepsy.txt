Narcolepsy LyricsI should warn you
I go to sleep
I know you don't
Know what I mean
Yet
I get upset or happy
I go to sleep
Nothing hurts when
I go to sleep
But I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I know it seems that I don't care
But something in me does I swear
I don't remember all last year
I left you awake to cry the tears
While I was dreaming in streams
Flowing between the shores
Of joy and sadness
I'm drowning
Save me
Wake me up
I should warn you
I go to sleep
You won't know when
I go to sleep
Cause I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I'm not tired
I just sleep2Embed
