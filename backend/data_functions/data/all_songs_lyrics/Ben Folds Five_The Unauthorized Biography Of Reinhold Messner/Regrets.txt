Regrets LyricsI thought about sitting on the floor in second grade
I couldn't keep the pace
I thought I was the only one moving in slow motion
While the other kids knew something I did not
But if I acted like a clown
I thought it'd get me throughâ€”it did
But that don't work no more
You're not a kid no more
I thought i'd do some traveling
Never did
Regrets, regrets
I thought about the hours wasted watching TV
Drinking beer
I thought about the things I thought about
Until immobilized with fear
And all the great ideas I had
And how we just made fun
Of those who had the guts to try and fail
And then I ended up in jail
Regrets, regrets
In for a day
Seems the police had make a computer mistake
Said there must be thousands like me with the same name
Anyway, I thought about the things I settled for
Or never tried
I never visited my grandma even once
When she was sick before she died
So i don't blame you if you never come to see me
Here again
Regrets, regrets1Embed
