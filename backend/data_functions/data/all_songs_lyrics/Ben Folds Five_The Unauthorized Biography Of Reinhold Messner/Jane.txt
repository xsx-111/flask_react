Jane LyricsJane be Jane
You're better that way
Not when you're trying
Imitating something you think you saw
Jane be Jane
And if sometimes that might
Drive them away
Let them stay there
You don't need them anyway
You're worried there might not be
Anything at all inside
But that you're worried
Should tell you that's not right
Don't try to see yourself
The way that others do
It's no use
You're worried there might not be
Anything at all inside
But that you're worried
Should tell you that's not right
You've had it harder than anyone could know
So hard to let it go
But it's your life
And you can decorate it
As you like
Beneath the paint and armour
In your eyes the truth still shines
Jane be Jane
