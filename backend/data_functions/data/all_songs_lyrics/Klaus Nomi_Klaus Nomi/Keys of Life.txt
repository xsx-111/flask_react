Keys of life
Keys of life
Keys of life
From ancient worlds I come
To see what man has done
What's fact and what is fiction
To judge the contradiction
Keys of life
Keys of life
The future has begun
Much work has to be done
You're running out of time
Beware the sign, the sign
Keys of life
Keys of life
Exploring new dimension
New lifestyle by intention
Do not ignore advise
You hold the keys of life
Keys of life
Keys of life
