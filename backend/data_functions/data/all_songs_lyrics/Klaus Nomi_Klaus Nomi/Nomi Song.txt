Nomi Song LyricsIf they saw my face
Could I still take a bow?
Will they know me
Know me, know me now?
Though I know my place
If science will allow
Will they know me
Know me, know me?
Now I'm all alone
It's like some kind of test
My, how I have grown
Will they know me now?
Will the human race
With their collective brow
Will they know me
Know me, know me now?Embed
