Lightning Strikes LyricsListen to me, baby, you got to understand
You're old enough to learn the makings of a man
Listen to me, baby, it's time to settle down
Am I asking too much for you to stick around?
Every boy wants a girl he can trust to the very end
Baby, that's you, won't you stay?
But til then when I see lips begging to be kissed
I can't stop, I can't stop myself!
Chorus:
Lightning's striking again! (...and again, and again, and again...)
Lightning's striking again! (...and again, and again, and again...)
Lightning's striking again! (...and again, and again, and again...)
Lightning's striking again! (...and again, and again, and again...)
Nature's taken over my one track mind
Believe it or not, you're in my heart all the time
All the girls are saying that you'll end up a fool
For the time being, baby, live by my rules!
When I settle down, I want one baby on my mind
Forgive and forget, and I'll make up for all lost time
She's put together fine and she's on my mind
I can't stop! I can't stop myself!
(repeat chorus)
There's a chapel in the pines
Waiting for us around the bend
Picture me in your mind, love forever!
But 'til then
When I see lips begging to be kissed
I can't stop, I can't stop myself!
(repeat chorus)1Embed
