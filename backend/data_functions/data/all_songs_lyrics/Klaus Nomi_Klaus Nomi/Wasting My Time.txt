Wasting My Time LyricsChorus:
I'm wasting my time
I'm wasting my time on you, on you
(I'm wasting my time)
(I'm wasting my time on you, on you)
When I'm with you
I feel so unreal
When I'm with you
Just don't know how I feel
(repeat chorus)
Though I say I'm in love
Just don't do me no good
Though I say I'm in love
Just don't feel like it should
(repeat chorus)
So I'm singing this song
But I won't stay for long
So I'm singing this song
But I won't stay for long
(repeat chorus)
Because all I can do
Is just thinking of you
Because all I can feel
Is my sweet love for you
(repeat chorus)Embed
