The Twist LyricsCome on, humans
Let's do the twist
Come on, humans
Let's do the twist
Take me by the little hand
And go like this
Father's just sleepin'
And mother's not around
Father's just sleepin'
And mother's not around
We're going to twist
Till we tear the house down
You should see
My little sis
You should see
My litlle sis
She knows how to rock
And she knows how to twist
Twist me, twist
Oh, yes
Let's do the twist
Just go like this
And you do the twist
Ha ha ha ha....Embed
