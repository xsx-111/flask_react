Lifeline LyricsLike a fighter that lost his will to kill
You knew it was time to go
But as I lay in a state of surrender
You chose me to say your last hello
(instrumental break)
Like a fighter that lost his will to kill
You knew it was time to go
You came upon me as I lay in a state of surrender
You said you're not afraid, you know me well
Because I felt you die
Why did you say you would touch me?
The wind blew sugar-sweet
As you passed that silver life lineEmbed
