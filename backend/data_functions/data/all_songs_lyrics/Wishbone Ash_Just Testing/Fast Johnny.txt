Fast Johnny LyricsI fell in love with a dark-eyed lady
She seemed to be on her own
And from nowhere when I came over -
A princess without a throne
That night as I was takin' her home
I got a feelin' that we weren't alone
Keep your hands on the wheel, we got a tail there
Tryin' to put us off the road
What are you gonna do when a man from her past catches up with you?
What are you gonna do when he wants to make a claim on you?
Fast Johnny, I'm flat on the boards -
Fast Johnny, I'm cutting the corners -
Fast Johnny, I'm closin' the door -
Fast Johnny, don't chase me in your car no more!
You know nobody can drive quite like I can
Runnin' every red light in town
We danced on the floor, danced on the street
Danced as the wheels turned around
Maybe Johnny, you'll meet your match
When you look into my Chevy's eyes
Keep your engine hot and running
'Cause this sweet little honey's gonna take you by surprise
What are you gonna do when a man from her past catches up with you?
What are you gonna do when he wants to make a claim on you?
Fast Johnny, I'm flat on the boards -
Fast Johnny, I'm cuttin' the corners -
Fast Johnny, I'm closin' the door -
Fast Johnny, don't chase me in your car no more!
