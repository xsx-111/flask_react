Living Proof LyricsWhy does love have to?
Where does it go to
Outta my door?
How much have you got?
Is it enough for me
Or will I want more?
Oh,oh, you tell me you just want some fun
Oh, oh, I'm trapped between the fire and the man with the gun
Time in a vacuum
Waiting for someone to say what they think
But all that pretending doesn't convince me
'Cause they just want to buy me a drink
Oh, oh, you tell me you wanna be free
Oh, oh, baby, I'm trapped between the devil and the deep blue sea
It's night in the city
I'm filled with self-pity -
I'm taking the air
If somebody hits me
Here in this city
I swear I just don't care
Oh, oh, I got to have some proof
Oh, oh, I'm trapped like a cat on a hot tin roof
Oh, oh, I just got to have proof
Oh, oh, I'm trapped like a cat on a hot tin roof
I got to have proof
I got to have proof
I got to have proof
I got to have proof. (Repeat)Embed
