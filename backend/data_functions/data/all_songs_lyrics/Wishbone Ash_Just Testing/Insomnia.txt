Insomnia LyricsWhen you've done someone wrong
And karma has come
To settle the score with you
The snake in you crawling
Pinned to the ground
Eyes open wide and blue
Insomnia
Closer, but no closer
Insomnia
Closer, but no closer
The night you were laid
When you had it made
When everything fell into place
Higher and higher
Too fast to miss a beat
Body and bones as well
Insomnia
Burning like a hell
Insomnia
Oh, burning, yes, burning like a hell
(instrumental break)
Where does it come from?
Where does it go?
Flowing over your skin
Walking and talking
Dancing 'till dawn
When you just can't give in to
Insomnia
Waiting to get you
Insomnia
Waiting to get you
Waiting to, waiting to get you, inso...
Waiting to, waiting to get you, inso...
Don't let it, don't let it, inso...
Don't let it, don't let it
Don't let it get youEmbed
