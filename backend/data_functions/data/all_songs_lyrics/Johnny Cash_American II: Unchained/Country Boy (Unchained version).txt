Country Boy (Unchained version) Lyrics
Country boy ain't got no shoes
Country boy ain't got no blues
Well, you work all day while you're wanting to play
In the sun and the sand with a face that's tan
At the end of the day when your work is done
You ain't got nothing but fun

Country boy ain't got no ills
Country boy, you don't owe no bills

You get a wiggly worm and then you watch him squirm
While you put him on a hook and you drop him in a brook
If everything's gonna turn out right
You're gonna fry fish tonight

Country boy, got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes

Country boy got a shaggy dog
Country boy up a holler log
Well, he comes in a run when you pick up your gun
And with a shell or two and your dog and you
When you get your rabbit you'll skin his hide
He's gonna be good fried
Country boy, you got a lot to lose
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes

Country boy, you got work to do
Country boy in the morning dew
You gotta plant the seed, you gotta cut the weeds
There's many a row you know you gotta hoe
When it's quittin' time and your work is through
There's a lot of life in you

Country boy, you're lucky free
Country boy, I wish I was you and you was meEmbed
