Rowboat Lyrics

Rowboat, row me to the shore
She don't wanna be my friend no more
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul
She don't wanna be my friend no more

Pick me up
Give me some food to eat
In your truck
Going no place
I'll be home
Talking to nobody
You'll be strange
You'll be far away
Big fat moon
And my body's out of tune
With the burning waves
She's a billion years away
Dog food on the floor
And I've been like this before
She is all
And everything else is small
Pick me up
Give me some alcohol
In your truck
Playing the radio
I'll be home
With the gasoline
You'll be stoned
You'll be far away
Rowboat, row me to the shore
She don't wanna be my friend no more
She dug a hole in the bottom of my soul
She is all, and everything else is smallEmbed
