Spiritual Lyrics
Jesus, I don't wanna die alone
Jesus, oh, Jesus, I don't wanna die alone
My love wasn't true, now all I have is you
Jesus, oh, Jesus, I don't wanna die alone

Jesus, if you hear my last breath
Don't leave me here, left to die a lonely death
I know I have sinned but Lord, I'm suffering
Jesus, oh, Jesus, if you hear my last breath

Jesus, I don't wanna die alone
Jesus, oh, Jesus, I don't wanna die alone
My love wasn't true, now all I have is you
Jesus, oh, Jesus, I don't wanna die alone

Jesus, Jesus, all my troubles
All my pain will leave me once again
All my troubles, all my pain
It's gonna leave me once again
All my troubles, all my pain
It's gonna leave me once again
Gonna leave me once againEmbed
