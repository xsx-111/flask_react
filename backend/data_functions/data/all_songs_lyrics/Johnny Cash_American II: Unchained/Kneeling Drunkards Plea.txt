Kneeling Drunkards Plea Lyrics
"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down

I went down by an old country church
I saw the drunkard stagger and lurch
And as he reached his mother's grave
I saw that drunkard kneel and pray

"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down

"Bring my darling boy to me"
Was his mother's dying plea
And as he staggered through the gate
Alas, he came just one day too late
Three years have passed since she went away
Her son is sleeping beside her today
And I know that in Heaven his mother he'll see
For God has heard that drunkard's plea
"Lord, have mercy on me"
Was the kneeling drunkard's plea
And as he knelt there on the ground
I know that God in Heaven looked down
I know that God in Heaven looked downEmbed
