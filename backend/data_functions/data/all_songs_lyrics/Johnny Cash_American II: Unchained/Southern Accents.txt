Southern Accents Lyrics
There's a southern accent
Where I come from
The young'uns call it country
The Yankees call it dumb

I got my own way of talking
But everything is done
With a southern accent
Where I come from

Now that drunk-tank in Atlanta
Was just a motel room to me
I think I might go work Orlando
If them orange groves don't freeze

I've got my own way of working
But everything is run
With a southern accent
Where I come from

For just a minute there I was dreaming
For just a minute it was all so real
For just a minute she was standing there with me
There's a dream I that I keep having
Where my mama comes to me
And she kneels down over by the window
And says a prayer for me

I got my own way of praying
And every one's begun
With a southern accent
Where I come from

We have our own way of living
And everything is done
With a southern accent
Where I come fromEmbed
