Unchained Lyrics
I have been ungrateful
I've been unwise
Restless from the cradle
Now I realize
It's so hard to see the rainbow
Through glasses dark as these
Maybe I'll be able
From now on, on my knees

Oh, I am weak
Oh, I know I am vain
Take this weight from me
Let my spirit be unchained

Old man swearing at the sidewalk
I'm overcome
Seems that we've both forgotten
Forgotten to go home
Oh, have I seen an angel?
Oh, have I seen a ghost?
Where's that rock of ages
When I need it most?
Oh, I am weak
Oh, I know I am vain
Take this weight from me
Let my spirit be unchainedEmbed
