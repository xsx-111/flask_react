Mean Eyed Cat Lyrics
I gave my woman half my money at the general store
I said, "Now buy a little groceries and don't spend no more"
But she paid ten dollars for a ten-cent hat
And bought some store-bought cat food for that mean-eyed cat

When I woke up this morning and I turned my head
There wasn't a cotton-picking thing on her side of the bed
I found a little old note where her head belonged
It said, "Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone"

When I heard a whistle blowing and the big wheels a-turning
I was scared as I could be
I put on my overalls and I headed for town
Gonna bring her back with me

I asked the man down at the station if he'd seen her there
I told him all about her pretty eyes and long blonde hair
He spit his tobacco and said, "I'll be dad blamed"
"I believe I did see her leaving on the eastbound train"

I bought a round-trip ticket on the eastbound train
I was broke as I could be
But when I come back, I gotta buy another ticket
Gonna bring her back with me
Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas
And I worked up the guts to call my mother-in-law
She said, "I'll tell you where she is if you act right
She's working four-to-twelve at Trucker's World tonight"

Well, when I walked in, she saw me and she took off her apron
And she grabbed her going-home hat
She bought a ticket with her tips, now we're curled up on the sofa
Me and her and that mean-eyed catEmbed
