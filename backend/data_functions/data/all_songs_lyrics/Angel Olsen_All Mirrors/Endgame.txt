Endgame Lyrics
I needed more, needed more than love from you
I  needed more, needed you to, to be with me
I  wrote it out, wrote it out so you might stay
I wrote it out, wrote it down, so we could play

There in your eyes, how many times, can a heart go back?
It's  in the life that we made, we put it all on track
For  everyone else to see, bigger than ourselves
Made it all, did the dance, came out through this hell

I  needed more, needed more than love from you
I needed more, needed you to be with me
We made a deal, made a dream, made it real, you see
Made a life, made a scene, made up everything

Life  carries on just like a song I sing, but I don't know
I walk away from all the noise and I'm on my own
I don't know how to speak with you, I'd rather be alone
But somehow whenever I do, I wonder why so long

I needed more needed more than love from you
I needed more, needed you to be with me2Embed
