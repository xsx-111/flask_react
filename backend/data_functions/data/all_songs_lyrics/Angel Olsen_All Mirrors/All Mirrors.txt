All Mirrors LyricsI've been watchin' all of my past repeatin'
There's no endin', and when I stop pretendin'
See you standin', a million moments landin'
On your smile, buried alive, I could have
Died to stay there, never have to leave there
All this trouble tryin' to catch right up with me
I keep movin', knowin' someday that I will be
Standin', facin', all mirrors are erasin'
Losin' beauty, at least at times it knew me
At least at times it knew me
At least at times it knew me
Standing, facin', all mirrors are erasin'
Losin' beauty, at least at times it knew me
Standin', facin', all mirrors are erasin'
Losin' beauty, at least at times it knew me
At least at times it knew me
At least at times it knew me
(At least at times it knew me)
(At least at times it knew me)
(At least at times it knew me)
(At least at times it knew me)7Embed
