Lark Lyrics
To forget you is to hide
There  is still so much left to recover
If  only we could start again
Pretending we don't know each other
I could not come back the same
This  city's changed, it's not what it was
Back  when you loved me
Walking down that path we made
When  we thought what we had was such a good thing

Hiding out inside my head
It's me again, it's no surprise
I'm on my own now
Every  time I turn to you
I see the past, it's all that lasts
And all I know how
Learn to look me in the eyes
Yet I still don't feel it's me you're facing
Say your heart is always mine
What about old times? You can't erase them

Wishing we could only find one another
All we've done here is blind one another
Hate can't live in this heart here forever
Have to learn how to make it together
The way you scream like something else is a matter
The way you scream like something else is a matter
The way you scream like something else is a—
Baby, I was there and I held him
I was there, and he put it all on me
Baby, I was there and I held him
Right there, where no one else could see
Took me into his arms
Told me that I was the reason
Told me that I was the woman
He'd always be losing, always be dreaming

Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on

You say you love
Every single part
What about my dreams?
What about the heart?
Trouble from the start
Trouble with the heart
Oh, trouble with the heart7Embed
