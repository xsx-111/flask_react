Tonight Lyrics
I like the air that I breathe
I like the thoughts that I think
I like the life that I lead

Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you

Like how it's all coming clear
All the words that I hear
Like how I’m not in fear

Without you
Without you
Without you
Without you

And it's not because I don't love
Just don’t have time to explain
All the things you think you've come to understand
About me
About me
About me
About me2Embed
