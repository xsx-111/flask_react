Impasse Lyrics
Go on, on ahead, tell your friends I was wrong
Take it all out on me, I'm too caught up to see
Everyone will believe, will believe, will believe
Say what you want, what you need, break it down
Take what's left, and get out, tell them what it's about

You know best, don't you now
Don't you now, don't you now

Don't you now, don't you now
Don't you now, don't you now
You think this is what I wanted when I said
I'm just livin' in my head
I'm just livin' in my
I'm just workin' for the name

I never lost anyone
I never lost anyone
I never lost anyone
(I didn't)

I'm just livin' in my head
I'm just livin' in my head
I'm just workin' for the name
I never lost anyone
I never lost anyone1Embed
