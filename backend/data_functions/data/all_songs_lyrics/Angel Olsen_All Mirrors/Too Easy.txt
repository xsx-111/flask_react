Too Easy Lyrics
Anyway you want to, honey
Take me, show me how you want me
I believe all that you say
I can see it in the way

We are walkin' through together
It's too easy, almost never
One could make me laugh forever
I'd do anything for you
Oh, I'd do anything for you

Some things happen for a reason
Cancel all these plans I'm dreaming
Living for something that's real
You walked in and now I feel

I'm not alone, I'm not
The real truth of it all
Is that we haven't lost
After the wait, come down
I looked around and found something else
Something that was
I'm not alone, I'm not
The real truth of it all
Is that I haven't lost
After the wait, come down
I looked around and found something else
Something that was
Bigger than us
Bigger than us
