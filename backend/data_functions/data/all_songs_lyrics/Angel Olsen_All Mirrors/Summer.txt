Summer Lyrics
Took a while, but I made it through
If I could show you the hell I'd been to
Kept climbing ’til one day I looked back
Was so high, I couldn't think to land

And then one moment I was blown away
And there was nothing left that I could say or do

Took a while, but I made it through
If I could show you the hell I'd been to
Lost the light, but then the sun was shining
Couldn’t hide it and I wasn't trying

And all those people I thought knew me well
After all that time, they couldn't tell
I lost my soul, was just a shell
There was nothing left that I could lose

Took a while, but I made it through
If I could show you the hell I'd been to
Lost the light, but then the sun was shining
Couldn't hide it and I wasn't trying
Was I becoming what I had to be?
Was that the truth I was supposed to see?
I may have never found my way to you
And all those summer days were like a dream
Woke me from a restless sleep
Made me quiet, had me weak
And all the weight of all the world came rushing throughEmbed
