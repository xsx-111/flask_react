Spring Lyrics
Don't take it for granted
Love when you have it
You might be looking over
A lonelier shoulder
Remember when we said
We'd never have children
I'm holdin' your baby
Now that we're older

How time has revealed how
Little we know us
I've been too busy
I should've noticed
Days that keep slipping
A life that I'm missing
I wish it were true love
I wish we were kissing

Show me a love that
Won't ever leave or
Look for another
One to deceive
I'm beginning to wonder
If anything's real
Guess we're just at the mercy
Of the way that we feel

Alive with a past
No other can share
Alone with a heart
No other can bear
So give me some heaven
Just for a while
Make me eternal
There in your smile
