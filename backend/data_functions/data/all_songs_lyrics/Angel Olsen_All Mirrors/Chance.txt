Chance Lyrics
What is it you think I need?
Maybe  it's too hard to see
I  don't want it all
I've had enough
I don't want it all
I've  had a love
Worst  feeling I've ever had is gone
It's gone
I  know how it all comes back, I know too well
Now I'm done
I'm leaving once again
Making my own plans
I'm  not looking for the answer
Or anything that lasts
I just want to see some beauty
Try and understand
If we got to know each other
How rare is that?

All that space in between where we stand
Could be our chance
Could be our chance

I'm walking through the scenes
I'm saying all the lines
I wish I could un-see some things that gave me life
I wish I could un-know some things that told me so
I wish I could believe all that's been promised me
It's hard to say forever love
Forever's just so far
It's hard to say forever love
Forever's just so far
It's hard to say forever love
Forever's just so far
Why don't you say you're with me now
With all of your heart?
With all of your heart?
With all of your heart?12Embed
