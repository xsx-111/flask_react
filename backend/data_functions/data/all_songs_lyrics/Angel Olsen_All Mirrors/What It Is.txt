What It Is Lyrics
It's easy when you're passionate
It's  easy when you know your way around
It's  easy when you love something
It's easy if you know exactly how

It's easy to openly say
Oh,  that you could never change your mind
That  feeling coming over you
It would never dare leave you behind

It's  easy if you tell the truth
But knowing what it is, it's not enough
Knowing that you love someone
Doesn't mean you ever were in love

It's  never easy to admit
That maybe you just want
Just to feel something again
You just wanted to forget
That your heart was full of shit
You just wanted to forget
You just wanted to forget
It's easy when you're passionate
It's easy when you know your way around
It's easy when you love something
It's easy if you know exactly how

It's easy if you tell the truth
But knowing what it is, it's not enough
And knowing that you love someone
Doesn't mean you ever were in love

It's never easy to admit
That maybe you just want
Just to feel something again
You just wanted to forget
That your heart was full of shit
You just wanted to forget
You just wanted to forgetEmbed
