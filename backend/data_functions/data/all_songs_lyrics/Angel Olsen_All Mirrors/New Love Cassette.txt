New Love Cassette Lyrics
I'm gonna help you see when you're hard to find
Gonna gather strength, give you all my mind
Wanna show you my love all the time
Wanna hold you close and let you lie

Gonna love you
True you

When you're out of touch and you don't know how
Gonna give you my hands, gonna show you now
Gonna show you love all of the time
Gonna be your breath when you're out of life

Love free
Take me


Love free
Take me
Love free
Take me4Embed
