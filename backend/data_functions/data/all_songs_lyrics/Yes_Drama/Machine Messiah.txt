Machine Messiah LyricsPART 1
Run down a street where the glass shows that summer has gone
Age in the doorways, resenting the pace of the dawn
All of them standing in line
All of them waiting for time
From time, the great healer
The machine messiah is born
Cables that carry the life to the cities we build
Threads that link diamonds of light to the satanic mills
Ah, to see in every way
That, we feel it every day, and know that
Maybe we'll change
Offered the chance
To finally unlearn our lessons and alter our stance
PART 2
Friends make their way into systems of chance
(Friends make their way of escape into systems of chance)
Escape to freedom, I need to be there
Waiting and watching, the tables are turning
I'm waiting and watching
I need to be there
I care to see them walk away
And, to be there when they say
They will return
Machine, machine messiah
The mindless search for a higher controller
Take me to the fire and hold me
Show me the strength of your singular eye
PART 3
History dictating symptoms of ruling romance
Claws at the shores of the water upon which we dance
All of us standing in line
All of us waiting for time
To feel it all the way
And to be there when they say they know that
Maybe we'll change
Offered the chance
To finally unlearn our lessons and alter our stance
Machine, machine messiah
Take me into the fire
Hold me, machine messiah
And show me
The strength of your singular eye2Embed
