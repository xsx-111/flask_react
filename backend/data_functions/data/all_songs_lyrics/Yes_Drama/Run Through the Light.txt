Run Through the Light LyricsI asked my love to give me shelter
And all she offered me were dreams
Of all the moments spent together
That move like never ending streams
Run through the light
Now everything is alright
Run thro' the light of day
Run to the light of night
And every movement made together
Till every thought was just the same
And all the pieces fit forever
In the game
The light
Run through the light
Now everything is alright
Run thro' the light of day
You run to the light of night
Run to the light
Run to the light
Run through the light
To the light
I asked my love to give me shelter
And all she offered me were dreams
Run through the light
Of all the moments spent together
Run to the light
That move like never ending streams
Run through the light
Run to the light
Welcome to the light
Now everything is okay
You run thro' the light of night
You come to the light of dayEmbed
