Solid Gold Brass LyricsHeart of a woman
But she's a child
Something inside
That's gonna drive you wild
You, you go take a walk
I don't need that kind of talk
'Cause I'm a man not a mother
Solid gold brass got a mean streak
And it's running through my veins
Solid gold brass gotta green streak
And it's going to my brain
But she helps me hang on in there
Solid gold brass
Stars in her eyes
She'd playin' her game
Smooth words and T birds
Her only claim to fame
Hey, just watch what you say
Don't talk about her that way
You know I said I'm a man not a mother
Solid gold brass got a mean streak
And it's running through my veins
Solid gold brass gotta green streak
And it's going to my brain
And she helps me hang on in there
Solid gold brass got a mean streak
And it's running through my veins
Solid gold brass gotta green streak
And it's going to my brain
And she helps me hang on in there
Solid gold brass
Heart of a woman
But she's a child
Something inside
That's gonna drive you wild
Solid gold brass got a mean streak
And it's running through my veins
Solid gold brass gotta green streak
And it's going to my brain
Solid gold brass got a mean streak
And it's running through my veins
Solid gold brass gotta green streak
And it's going to my brain
And she helps me hang on in there
