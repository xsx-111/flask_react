Set Me Free LyricsGagged, ball and chained
Feel just the same
Heads on the wall
Maybe you're just playing games
Set me free
Mauled by her hound
Hangin' around
Is this for real
I don't know when I'll be found
Set me free
Ahh set me free
Ahh set me free, from you
Taken by force
By you of course
Far from my bed
I know I'd rather be dead
Set me free
Ahh set me free
Ahh set me free, from you
Fire in my brain
Burn me insane
Making your mark
Don't leave me here in the dark
Set me free
Call me a saint
That's what I ain't
Inside my head
Maybe I'd feel better dead
Set me free
Ahh set me free
Ahh set me free, from youEmbed
