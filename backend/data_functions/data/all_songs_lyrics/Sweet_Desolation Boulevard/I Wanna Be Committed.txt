I Wanna Be Committed LyricsI wanna be committed
I wanna be committed
I thought I was a space age cowboy
I thought I was a sweet and sour chow-boy
I thought I was a thinker
A juvenile drinker
I thought I had some kind of a brain
'Til they told me I just a rumour
A cheap and nasty looner
As it turned out, I was just insane
I wanna be committed
Insanity permitted
I wanna be committed for my mind
I wanna be committed
Don't let me be remitted
I wanna be committed if you don't mind
At the dance last Saturday night
I was rockin' and rollin' and holding her tight
'Til he got his hands on her
But when he started out to play
She kept pushing him away
And he got a funny feeling
He was walking on the ceiling
And someone was heard to say, "If you don't mind, sir"
I don't mind
I thought I was a teenage dream boy
With a brain made of solid plastic alloy
I thought I was a tripper
Ain't nobody hipper
'Til it turned out I was going down the drain
I wanna be committed
Insanity permitted
I wanna be committed for my mind
I wanna be committed
Don't let me be remitted
I wanna be committed if you don't mind
I wanna be committed
Insanity permitted
I wanna be committed for my mind
I wanna be committed
I wanna be committed
I wanna be committed for my mindEmbed
