Scream In Blue LyricsCome to me now, be careful of what you say
Don't make a sound, there's noise enough in this
Come with me now, let night move into day
Let sheets keep secrets that no one else could know
I could kill for this one time and not be caught
She said to me this is the one and I know
Come to me now, this is the final hour
When I'm dreaming I dream in blue
When I'm dreaming I dream of you
When I'm screaming I scream in blueEmbed
