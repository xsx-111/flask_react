Tin Legs & Tin Mines LyricsVerse 1
I'm gonna wait for the moment to come
I'm gonna wait till we all stop from running
Boxed in like candles, polar bear pride
Turning to terror as the script is read out
Unwilling actors, accomplished protractors will shout
I'm gonna wait till we reach the sky
Tin legs and tin mines, anyone cries
Cry in the hope that there'll be tomorrow
Waiting around there must be a time
Time to start thinking and working it out
Come with me now, come with me now, we'll be laughing
Hook
Who's running the world today?
Verse 2
I'm gonna wait till they knock on my door
I'm gonna wait till they dig up the floor boards
Poland in Disneyland, wet dream control
Super computer, the new contraband
I'm gonna wait, we must make a stand
Come with me now, stand with me now one more timeEmbed
