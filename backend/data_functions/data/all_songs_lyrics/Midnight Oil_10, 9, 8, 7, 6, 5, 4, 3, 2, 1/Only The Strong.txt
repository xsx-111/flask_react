Only The Strong LyricsWhen I'm locked in my room
I just want to scream
And I know what they mean
(One more day of eating and sleeping)
Speak to me, speak to me
I'm not spoken for, I'm ready to talk
Look at me, look at me
I've been broken up and shaken down
Speak to me, speak to me
I'm at the edge of myself I'm dying to talk
Look at me, won't you look at me
Back once more at the point of no return
When I'm locked in my room
I just want to scream
And I know what they mean
Only the strongEmbed
