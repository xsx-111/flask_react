Maralinga Lyrics(spoken)
I come from a land of wide open spaces
Where the world turns around us and we just follow suit
There's heat in the air and peace reigns supreme
Got white flags on the clothes lines and the deals are never clean
In the wind
The ashes fly
The poison crown
The charcoal ground
And if you can't see the smile in me, that's where I wanna be
There's only God
There's only Christ
Think I'll lie down for just a while
And if you can't see the smile in me, well that's where I wanna be
(spoken)
And the grass became granite and the sky a black sheet
Our bed was a graveyard and we couldn't feel our blistered feet
And the moaning and groaning and sighing of death
And the silence that followed and the very harsh reality
So we watch and check them out
And listen as we learn
Throw the pearls before the swine
Ebb and flow and turning tide
Yeah we watch and catch them up
No matter how they jump
The pigs will have to come to ground
We've gotta make it happen
Well it's really not that new yeah
Try and make it happen now
What are we to do yeah
Maybe there's a chance for you
All around
An eerie sound
Their dreams a cloud
Their world in shrouds
'Cos in the wind
Those ashes fly
Not much time
But time to try
And if you can't see the smile in me, that's cos I wanna be
I want to be here at the end. I have to be here at the end
