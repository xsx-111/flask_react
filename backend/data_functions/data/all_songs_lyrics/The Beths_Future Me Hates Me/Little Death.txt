Little Death Lyrics
When you're near
My heart starts beating faster
The world starts moving slower
And I just freeze
And it's cold, the steam escapes
Through my lips and dissipates
And you breathe it in
We all breathe it in
Your smile it makes me weak
And the red spreads to my cheeks
You make me feel three glasses in

And you say my name
My legs support a little less
My tongue becomes a little mess
My lips are longing to confess, ooh
My lungs they catch on every breath
My heart beats harder at the cage
Inside my chest

I die, I die a little death
I die, I die a little death
You come and go
A lightning bolt in daytime
That burns into my eyeline
You're all I see
There's no sign of the sun
So the moon moves out in front
She wants to be aligned
We all wanna be aligned
And your voice it makes me weak
I'm wasted when you speak
You hit me hard as red wine

And you say my name
My legs support a little less
My tongue becomes a little mess
My lips are longing to confess, ooh
My lungs they catch on every breath
My heart beats harder at the cage
Inside my chest

And I die, I die a little death
I die, I die a little death
I die, I die a little death
I die, I die a little death
You say my name
(You say, you say)
My balance takes a little rest
(I die, I die)
My conscience hung under duress
(You say, you say)
My twitching fingers do their best
(I die, I die)
To keep their wandering selves in check
(You say, you say)
My mind it finds a new address
(I die, I die)
This life is cursed, you're heaven-blessed
(You say, you say)
This human god, this honoured guest
(I die, I die)
Filling up the emptiness
(You say, you say)
My legs support a little less
(I die, I die)
My tongue becomes a little mess
(You say, you say)
My lips are longing to confess
(I die, I die)
But I'll never tell, you'll never guess
(You say, you say)
My lungs they catch on every breath
(I die, I die)
My heart beats harder at the cage
(You say, you say)
Inside my chest
And I die, I die a little death
(You say my name)
I die, I die a little death
(You say my name)
I die, I die a little death
(You say my name)
I die, I die a little deathEmbed
