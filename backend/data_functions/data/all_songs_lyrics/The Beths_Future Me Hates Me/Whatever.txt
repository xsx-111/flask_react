Whatever Lyrics
Blind, you're blind
Full of breaths and sobs, and shakes, and shakes
Saying you will do whatever it takes
(Whatever, yeah, whatever)
Call declined
Say you're 'round the corner, fine, okay
You think I will buy whatever you say
(Whatever, yeah, whatever)

Now you're getting me started
You're pulling the yarn, and
You're pulling it harder and I think I'm gonna (I think I'm gonna),
You're getting me started, you're pulling the yarn, and
You're breaking my heart
You're making me want to

Crash the car, we'll hit the water
Brush the rock and wait for the maker
(Ooh)
And if he doesn't show (Ah-ah-ah)
Then heaven knows, heaven knows
I'll make you feel so blue
You arrive
Towing silence on a lively eve
Eyes are crying for another reprieve
(Another, yeah, whatever)
And we're blood and water but my back is blown (Ooh)
Your shoulders, slumped, are saying
"You should've known I'd let you down again"
(Whatever, yeah, whatever)

Now you're getting me started
You're pulling the yarn, and
You're pulling it harder, and I think I'm gonna (I think I'm gonna)
You're getting me started, you're pulling the yarn, and
You're breaking my heart
You're making me want to

Crash the car, we'll hit the water
Brush the rock and wait for the maker (Ooh)
And if he doesn't show (Ah-ah-ah)
Then heaven knows, heaven knows
I'll make you feel so—

Baby, you're breaking my heart
Baby, you're breaking my heart
Why do you make it so hard?
You're breaking my heart

Crash the car we'll hit the water
Brush the rock and wait for the maker
And if he doesn't show
Then heaven knows, heaven knows
I'll make you feel so—
Crash the car, we'll hit the water
Brush the rock and wait for the maker
(Ooh)
And if he doesn't show (Ahh)
Then heaven knows, heaven knows
I'll make you feel so blue1Embed
