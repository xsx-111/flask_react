Not Running Lyrics
This stays in this room
Don't take it with you
If I told the truth
Then what would you do

How can we rely
Demand and supply
If you said goodbye
Would that be a lie

Breathe aloud
I promise it won't freak me out
I'm not running away
Open mouth
I wanna hear that broken sound
Tell me to stay
Oh I'm not running away
Ooh-ooh (Ah-ah)

Too far to be near
Are you really here (Ah-ah-ah)
Its alright to be scared
I feel you in fear
Breathe aloud
I promise it won't freak me out
I'm not running away
Open mouth
I wanna hear that broken sound
Tell me to stay
Oh I'm not running away

(Breathe aloud)
(I promise it won't freak me out)
(I'm not running away)
Oh I'm not running away
(Open mouth)
(I wanna hear that broken sound)
(Tell me to stay)
Oh I'm not running away
(Breathe aloud)
Ooh-ooh
(I promise it won't freak me out)
Ooh-ooh
(Not running away)
Ooh-ooh
Not running away
(Open mouth)
Ooh-ooh
(I wanna hear that broken sound)
Ooo-ooh
(Tell me to stay)
Ooh-ooh
I'm not running away2Embed
