River Run: Lvl 1 Lyrics
(Part of me so tired)


I feel like a time bomb
Ticking away
This lump in my throat
It's been there for ten straight days
Constricting the air flow
Where the things I say
Get caught on the way
To and from my brain

(Ooh-ooh)
And I'm tired all the time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I'm staying up all night

I'm filling up with vapour (Ooh)
But when the cold sinks in a little later (A little later)
I'm filling up with vapour (Ooh)
But when the cold sinks in a little later
A river will run
Oh-ooh, A river will
A river will

Passed out in front of
The TV screen
Turn up the volume
But I'm not listening
The dialogue is static
And I start to panic
And the music fades

Kate says in a message
(Ooh-ooh)
"Girl, we can wade it through
Take deep breaths
Stay ahead of it"
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
But I'm drifting out of view

I'm filling up with vapour (Ooh)
But when the cold sinks in a little later (A little later)
I'm filling up with vapour (Ooh)
But when the cold sinks in a little later
A river will run (A river will)
Oh-ooh, a river will run (A river will)
Oh-ooh, a river will run (A river will)
Oh-ooh, a river will
(A river will)
A river will
(A river will)

What a tryin' state
What a miserable birthday
What a shame this constant condensation

Oh-oh
I felt you pulling away from me
The burn in your eyes, I replay it constantly
You said try to be happy
Try to be happy
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
A river will run
(A river will)
(A river will)
Oh, a river will run
(A river will)
(A river will)Embed
