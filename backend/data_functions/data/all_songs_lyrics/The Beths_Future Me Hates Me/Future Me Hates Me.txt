Future Me Hates Me Lyrics
I never wanted to, I didn't want to fall
I don't believe that love's a good idea at all
Oh, this well-designed woe
Everyone that I know is broken
And has fell for it before

Sometimes
I think I'm doing fine, I think I'm pretty smart
I'm quite convinced that I can keep myself apart
Oh, then the walls become thin
And somebody gets in, I'm defenseless
But it won't happen again
It probably won't happen again

But there's something about you
(About you, about you)
There's something about you
(About you, about you)
There's something about you
I wanna risk going through

Future heartbreak
Future headaches
Wide-eyed nights late-lying awake
With future cold shakes
From stupid mistakes
Future me hates me for
Hates me for
It's getting dangerous, I could get hurt, I know
I've counted up the cons, they far outweigh the pros
Oh, and the floodgates are down
It's the Marlborough Sounds, I am drowning
It's too late for me now
I need you sticking around

'Cause there's something about you
(About you, about you)
There's something about you
(About you, about you)
There's something about you
I wanna risk going through

Future heartbreak
Future headaches
Wide-eyed nights late-lying awake
With future cold shakes
From stupid mistakes
Future me hates me for
Hates me

Future heartbreak
Future headaches
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Wide-eyed nights late-lying awake
With future cold shakes
From stupid mistakes
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Future me hates me for
Hates me for
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Ba-bah ba, bah bah bah)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Ba-bah ba, bah bah bah)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Ba-bah ba, bah bah bah)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Future heartbreak
Future headaches
Wide eyed nights late-lying awake
With future cold shakes
From stupid mistakes
Future me hates me for
Hates me for

Future heartbreak
(The floodgates are down)
Future headaches
(It's the Marlborough Sounds)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Wide eyed nights late-lying awake
(Walls become thin and somebody gets in)
And future cold shakes
(It's a well-designed woe)
From stupid mistakes
(Everyone that I know)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
Future me hates me for
(Is broken)
Hates me
Future heartbreak
(Floodgates are down)
(It's the Malborough Sounds)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Walls become thin and somebody gets in)
Future cold shakes
(It's a well-designed woe)
(Ooh ooh ooh)
(Everyone that I know is broken)1Embed
