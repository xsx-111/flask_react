Uptown Girl Lyrics
(I'm feeling it!)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I feel it happening
The ending is beginning
My head is spinning
I want it to stop
'Cause now I know for sure
You want this to be over
I'm looking for closure
And coming up short

I will go out tonight
I'm gonna drink the whole town dry
Put poison in my wine
And hope that you're the one who dies
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

I was crying out
And hoping you could hear me
I thought we were friendly
Now I know we're not
You had always been
Someone I'd take a hit for
I thought you would care more
I guess I was wrong
I will go out tonight
I'm gonna drink the whole town dry
Put poison in my wine
And hope that you're the one who dies

I will go out tonight (I will go out)
I'm gonna drink the whole town dry
Put poison in my wine
And hope that you're the one who dies


I will go out tonight
I'm gonna drink the whole town dry
Put poison in my wine
And hope that you're the one who dies

I will go out tonight (I will go out)
I'm gonna drink the whole town dry
Put poison in my wine
And hope that you're the one who diesEmbed
