Less Than Thou LyricsAnother evening alone
Speaker by my ear
Shakes the air around the room
Another evening alone
Caressed by the sound
Of a warbling voice from a beautiful mouth
Trying my best to be less of a coward
Trying to be less
Trying to be less than thou

Another glance at the phone
Going over all the words
You used to cut the cord
Another evening alone
Collecting the lines (Ba ba ba, ba ba ba)
Lines that you use when you say that you're fine (Ba ba ba, ooh)
Trying to ignore all the typical signs
Trying to be more (ooh)
Trying to be more surprised (ooh)


Go ahead
Fly all night
Slow deplete
All your lives
Leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out this time
Go ahead
Fly all night
Slow deplete
All your lives
Leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out this time
