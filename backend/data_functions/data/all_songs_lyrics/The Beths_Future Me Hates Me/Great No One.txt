Great No One Lyrics
My eyelids float
Between two states
On the borderline
Flows a slow intake
They don't let much in
I don't let much out
Just a broken bulb
Flickering with doubt

Yeah
It happens all the time

Misery loves me
But I don't love her
It's a one-way street
Circling planet earth
If I take a right
Maybe I'll outrun
To the great unknown
Goes the great no one

Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
It happens all the time
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
It happens all the time
Wanna move
I do, I do, I do
I'm trying to get this right (Ooh)
I'm losing the appetite (Ooh-ooh)
It's not the way I'd choose, I'd choose, I'd choose
Always caught in between (Ooh)
The ache and the apathy (Ooh-ooh)

If there is a record
For most hours wasted
Least worthy reason
To cry on a Thursday evening
I'm in the lead

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(It happens all the time)
Yeah
It happens all the time

Wanna move
I do, I do, I do
I'm trying to get this right (Ooh)
I'm losing the appetite (Ooh-ooh)
It's not the way I'd choose, I'd choose, I'd choose
Always caught in between (Ooh)
The ache and the apathy (Ooh-ooh)

Staring up at the stars at night
I know their light is so
Behind the times
The more I live in the world, I find
Seclusion's pleasing
It's an illusion

Wanna move
I do, I do, I do
I'm trying to get this right (Ooh)
I'm losing the appetite (Ooo-ooh)
It's not the way I'd choose, I'd choose, I'd choose
Always caught in between (Ooh)
Always caught in between1Embed
