Happy Unhappy Lyrics
I was higher than a biplane
Then you hit me like a hurricane
I bailed out, hit the ground
Washed up in a storm drain

Stumbled up the driveway
With a handshake and a slow wave
Now I'm crashed out on the couch
Wondering if you feel the same

'Cause you're in my brain taking up space I need
For remembering pins and to take out the bins
And that one particular film that that actor was in
I see your face superimposed over everything
It ain't right

'Cause I was fine on my own
Tolling steady like a dial tone
Couldn’t you leave me?
I was happy unhappy
But now I'm overthrown
Wish my heart were really made of stone
And I could forget you
Like I really want to
I was living with your spare change
In the pocket of your cutaways
And I get so spent
Waiting on your lunch break
Broke every window pane
So I can feel the cold rain
When I lie in bed catching death
Trying to wash it all away

'Cause you're in my brain taking up space I need
For delivering lies and suppressing the sighs
And for navigating escape when I get lost in your eyes
It's taking up all of my time just to keep it in line
It ain't right

'Cause I was fine on my own
Tolling steady like a dial tone
Couldn’t you leave me?
I was happy unhappy
But now I'm overthrown
Wish my heart were really made of stone
And I could forget you
Like I really want to
I was fine on my own
Tolling steady like a dial tone
Couldn’t you leave me?
I was happy unhappy
But now I'm overthrown
Wish my heart were really made of stone
And I could forget you
Like I really want to

I could forget you
I could forget you
I could forget youEmbed
