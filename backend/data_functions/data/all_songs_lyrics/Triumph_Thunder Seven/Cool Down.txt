Cool Down LyricsWoman turn my head around
Woman my whole world's upside down
You come into my life and you tear it all apart
You can't put out the fire once it starts
'Til there's nothin' left to burn inside my heart
Cut the cards watch her deal
She got nerves of steel
Play with fire when you play her game
Love's desire feeds the flame
I realize I'm terrified
She's so hot can't stop
CHORUS:
Cool Down, Cool Down, you make me crazy
Makin' me hot, I gotta stop, I need a shot
Nothin' you can do or say can make her change her ways
Burns me up such a big shot girl
Got a one way ticket to a white hot world
I got the fever down to the bone
I'm on my knees, please, leave me alone
Cool Down, Cool Down, crazy, crazy
Makin' me hot, I gotta stop, 'cause I need a shot
I'm on fire burnin' all the time
Cool Down, Cool Down, down, down, Cool DownEmbed
