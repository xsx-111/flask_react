Rock Out, Roll On LyricsThe ghosts of Woodstock still haunt the next of kin
But the screams and shouts have turned to whispers on the wind
The time has come to face the music again
Back 'em up against the wall and bring the hammer down
Tell 'em that was then, my friend, but this is here and now
CHORUS:
Rock Out, Roll On
Rock out we've waited so long
Rock Out, Roll On we keep holding on
We've waited so long we've got to be strong
We'll just keep holdin' on...
Can't you hear the future knockin' down the door
Can't you hear the footsteps on the killing floor
Comes a time when you can't take anymore
When you've made up your mind, you step over the line
Then it's all just a question of time
CHORUS
A chance will surely come your way
To say the things you need to say
To play like no one else has played
And blow them away
Is it any wonder we somehow survive
The strength and the power comes from somewhere inside
You learn to turn your cheek and swallow your pride
Coming down to the wire, fighting fire with fire
Driven on by this burnin' desire
