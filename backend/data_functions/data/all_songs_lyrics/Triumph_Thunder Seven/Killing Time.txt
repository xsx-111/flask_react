Killing Time LyricsHe's got no place to go
She sits in an empty bedroom
Playing the radio
Every day they're regretting
All the things never tried;
Every day they're dyin'
Just a little bit more inside
All the lonely people
Waiting all their lives
They're empty and they're aching;
You can see it in their eyes
Time is slipping away, passing us by
You're wondering why but it's gone
Gone forever my friend
And it won't come again
So don't try to pretend you feel
Fine! Killing time, killing time...
You feel it's now or never
But the words don't seem to come
The fabric of your dreams
Starts to come undone
You realize it's over
Before it has begun
You're reaching for something special
But that someone never comes
You're on your own now
But you're living out a lie
This killing time is wasting you
I can see it in your eyes
Time is slipping away, passing us by
You're wondering why but it's gone
Gone forever my friend
And it won't come again
So don't try to pretend you feel
Fine! Killing time, killing time...
The time we waste on hate
Full of anger and jealousy
The times we act so cruel
All the times you turned on me
All those lonely yesterdays
When we were killing time
I needed you more than ever;
Couldn't you see it in my eyes?
Time was slipping away
Passing us by, now I could cry
Cause it's gone. Gone forever my friend
And it won't come again;
It's moved on and left us behind...
Time is slipping away, passing us by
You're wondering why but it's gone
Gone forever my friend
And it won't come again
So don't try to pretend you feel
Fine! Killing time, killing time...Embed
