Chicago is So Two Years Ago Lyrics
My heart is on my sleeve, wear it like a bruise or black eye
My badge, my witness
Means that I believed
Every single lie you said

'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you

But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home, all the colors
Of the street signs, they remind me of the
Pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house

She took me down and said
"Boys like you are overrated, so save your breath"
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads

'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you
But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home, all the colors
Of the street signs, they remind me of the
Pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house

You want apologies, girl, you might hold your breath
Until your breathing stops forever, forever
The only thing you'll get is this curse on your lips
I hope they taste of me forever

(Every pane of glass) There's a light on in Chicago
(Every pane of) And I know I should be home, all the colors
(Every pane of glass) Of the street signs, they remind me of the
Pickup truck out in front of your neighbors

With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body would be broken again, again
(But thereâ€™s a light on)
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body would be broken again, again10Embed
