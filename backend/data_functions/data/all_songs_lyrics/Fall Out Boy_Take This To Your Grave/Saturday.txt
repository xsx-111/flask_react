Saturday Lyrics
I'm good to go, and I'm going nowhere fast, it could be worse
I could be taking you there with me
I'm good to go, but it looks like
I'm still on my own
I'm good to go for something golden
Though the motions I've been going through have failed
And I'm coasting on potential towards a wall at a
Hundred miles an hour

When I say two more weeks, my foot is in the door, yeah
I can't sleep, in the wake of Saturday (Saturday)
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended

Pete and I attacked the laws of Astoria
With promise and precision and mess of youthful innocence
And I read about the afterlife
But I never really lived more than an hour (more than an hour)

When I say two more weeks, my foot is in the door, yeah
I can't sleep, in the wake of Saturday (Saturday)
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
And I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived
And I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived

Two more weeks, my foot is in the door
Me and Pete, in the wake of Saturday
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, Saturday...6Embed
