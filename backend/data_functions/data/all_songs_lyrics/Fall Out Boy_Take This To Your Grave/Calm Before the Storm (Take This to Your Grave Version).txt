Calm Before the Storm (Take This to Your Grave Version) Lyrics
I sat outside my front window, this story's going somewhere
He's well hung and I am hanging up
There's a song on the radio that says
"Let's get this party started," so let's get this party started

What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know
What meant the world had folded, like legs and fingers holding
Onto what escapes me, what he has, a better kiss that never lasts

You said, between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over," dead and gone, dead and gone, yeah

The calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out too

This is me standing in the arch of the door
Hating that look that's on your face
That says there's another fool like me
There's one born every minute, there's one born every minute
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know
What meant the world imploded, inflated, then demoted all my
Oxygen to product gas, and suffocated my last chance

To say between your smiles and regrets:
"Don't say it's over," dead and gone, dead and gone

The calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out too


Calm before the storm (set it off, set it off)
Whoa!

Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off!
And the sun burnt out tonight! Whoa, yeah!
Sun burnt out tonight, the sun burnt out tonight3Embed
