Sending Postcards From a Plane Crash (Wish You Were Here) Lyrics
I am such a sucker, and I'm always the last to know
My insides are copper, I'd kill to make them gold
Conversation got me here, another night alone in the city
So make my bed the grave and shovel dirt onto my sheets

Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars
Everything I wish for will never come true

When you go, I will forget everything about you
When you go, I will forget everything about you

I have seen sinking ships go
Down with more grace than you
Turn this up, I'll tune you out, another night alone in the city, yeah
Fake it like you matter, that's a lie we can both keep, oh

Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars
Everything I wish for will never come true
When you go, I will forget everything about you
When you go, I will forget everything about you

I will forget (when you go, I will forget everything about you)
When you go (I will forget everything about you)

Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars
Everything I wish for will never come true2Embed
