The Pros and Cons of Breathing Lyrics
Bury me standing under your window
With this cinder block in hand
Yeah 'cause no one will ever feel
Like this again
And if I could move, I'm sure it would
Only be to crawl back to you
I must have dragged my guts a block
They were gone by the time we (talked)

Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice

Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details, I don't want to know a thing

I hate the way you say my name
Like it's something secret
My pen is the barrel of the gun
Remind me which side you should be on
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice

Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details, I don't want to know a thing

I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate my
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate my
One, two, three, four!

Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice4Embed
