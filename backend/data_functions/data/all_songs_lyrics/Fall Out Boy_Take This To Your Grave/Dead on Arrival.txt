Dead on Arrival Lyrics
Hope this is the last time, 'cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's been dead on arrival
And there's no way to talk to you
This conversation's been dead on

A rivalry goes so deep between me
And this loss of sleep over you

This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So, I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your verse

No, it's not the last time, 'cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's still dead on arrival
And there's no way to talk to you
When you're dead on

A rivalry goes so deep between me
And this loss of sleep over you
This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So, I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your, whoo!

This is side one, flip me over, I know I'm not your favorite record
So, this is side one, flip me over

This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So, I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your verse

Here is your...
