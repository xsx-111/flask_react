Reinventing the Wheel to Run Myself Over Lyrics
I could walk this fine line between elation and success, but we all
Know which way I'm going to strike the stake between my chest
So, "You have to prove yourself!"
You'll have to prove it to me

So now you're waiting up for him
You're wasting time, yeah, every time

Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself

Whoa, can't do it by myself
I can't wake up to these reminders of who I am
A failure at everything, eighteen going on extinct
I know my place, it's nowhere you should roam

So now you're waiting up for him
Still wasting time, yeah, every time, yeah
Whoa, I can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself


Whoa, can't do it by myself (can't do it by myself)
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself (can't do it by myself)
Whoa, can't do it by myself

"You have to prove!"4Embed
