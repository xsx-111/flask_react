Grenade Jumper Lyrics
Yeah!

My heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style, and you came to watch us
Play like a "Big shot talent," but at the end of the day you know
Whoa, where we come from and where we call home, whoa

Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

They'll say it's not worth it, so we'll leave this town in ruin
Living like life's going out of style, and you came to watch us
Play like a "Big shot talent", but at the end of the day you know
Those busted lips we take back home

Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
So, hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
(So I'll tell everyone how much this means to me)
I know you would be there either way
(So I'll tell everyone how much this means to me)
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back, yeah!
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
(I know you would be there either way)
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
(I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade)
And I know this is belated, but we love you back!3Embed
