So-Long LyricsSo long, don't know where I'm going
But so long, you know you done me wrong
So long because I know I'm all gone
Goodbye, please tell me why
Goodbye, you always make me cry
Oh, why, why you never satisfied?
So long, I'm all packed up and on my way
So long, you'll need me some old sunny day
So long, yes, I'm, I'm going to stayEmbed
