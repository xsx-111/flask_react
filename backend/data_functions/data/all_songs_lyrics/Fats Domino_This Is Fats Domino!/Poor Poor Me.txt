Poor Poor Me LyricsWoke up this mornin'
Feelin' low
Where my loved one used to live
She ain't there no more
Poor me
Why such bad luck fall on me?
Poor me
I'm living in misery
What I'm gonna do
Is hard to tell
I'm not gonna kill myself
Though I might as well
Poor me
Why such bad luck fall on me?
Poor me
I'm living in misery
All I do
All day long
Fall down on my knees and pray
She'll come back home
Poor me
Why such bad luck fall on me?
Poor me
I'm living in misery
All I do
All day long
Fall down on my knees and pray
She'll come back home
Poor me
Why such bad luck fall on me?
Poor me
I'm living in miseryEmbed
