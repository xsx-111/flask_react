Trust In Me LyricsHey pretty baby, I wanna talk with you
Hey pretty baby, I wanna talk with you
I need somebody to tell my troubles to
Hey pretty baby, what are you doin' tonight?
Hey pretty baby, what are you doin' tonight?
Come and go with me, I'll make everything alright
Hey pretty baby, you're the type for me
Hey pretty baby, you're the type for me
I'll be good to you, you'll be trusting me
Hey pretty baby, what are you doin' tonight?
Yeah pretty baby, what are you doin' tonight?
Come and go with me, I'll make everything alright
Hey pretty baby, sure look good to meEmbed
