Troubles Of My Own LyricsNobody knows my trouble
Nobody seems to care
Bad luck and trouble
Follow me everywhere
Well I went to the fortune-teller
And I had my fortune told
She said "son don't worry
Days will change when you grow old"
Well I held my head up high
And I started, started to cry
I'm not gonna worry
Days will change by and by
Well I went to the fortune-teller
And I had my fortune told
She said "son don't worry
Days will change when you grow old"
Well you can see my dear old mother
My father, sister and brother
Tell them don't worry
I'm through with all my troubleEmbed
