Honey Chile LyricsYou will never win wonderful charm
But I love to hold you in my arms
Only you can fill me like you do
So hold that kiss for a long, long while
You know I love you, honey chile
I love to hear you whisper low
You know you really thrill me so
Only you can fill me like you do
So please don't put me on that shelf
You know I cannot help myself
I'm happy as a baby boy
You ain't nothin' but a bundle of joy
Only you can fill me like you do
Bend your legs and pigeon toes
You know I love you, goodness knows
You a devil with wonderful charm
But I love to hold ya in my arms
No one can fill me like you do
So hold that kiss for a long, long while
You know I love you, honey chile
I'm happy as a baby boy
You ain't nothin' but a bundle of joy
Only you can fill me like you do
Bend your legs and pigeon toes
You know I love you, goodness knowsEmbed
