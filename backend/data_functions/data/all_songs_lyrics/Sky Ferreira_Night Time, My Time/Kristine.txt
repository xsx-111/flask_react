Kristine Lyrics
I’m not feeling bad about it whatsoever
I’m happier near to the ground, so whatever
It’s more in numbness than in a bad or a great or a better
A giant comedy with museums and movies with Hedi
The Routines of the Young Millionaires

I will stand on the hill
Apolitical still in the name of the young millionaires
Misanthropy
Could it be in the name of the father and the son and the young on the run with a ton
Yeah, the young Millionaires

Even though I’m not quite, I’ve been living it right down
Pretending I am, what’s the point of saving
Stabbing pens in my hands, but I’m never working, just spending
A giant comedy with museums and shopping with Kristine
The routines of the young millionaires

So, I will stand on the hill
Apolitical still in the name of the young millionaires
Misanthropy
Could it be in the name of the father and the son and the young on the run with a ton
Yeah, the young Millionaires
I will rave in support of the sports
That we play in the gyms of the young millionaires
I will brand all my bills
With the badge that has filled up the hands of the young millionaires

I’ll shoot up the juice before making a truce
With not one in support of this young millionaire
Young millionaires
