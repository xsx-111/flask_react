Night Time, My Time Lyrics
I'm useless and I know it
Auditory hallucination, you said
"I don't care what I'm thinking about
But I'm thinking of you right now"

Night time is my time
I'm drowning, not waving
Falling in space
Will I slow down?
Or go faster and faster
Into you maybe?
Slow down right now

I wouldn't feel anything
When we burst into dust forever
And, no angels will help us out
'Cause they've all gone away

Night time is my time
I'm drowning, not waving
Falling in space
Will I slow down?
Or go faster and faster
Into you maybe?
Slow down right now
Faster and faster
Faster and faster
Going faster and faster11Embed
