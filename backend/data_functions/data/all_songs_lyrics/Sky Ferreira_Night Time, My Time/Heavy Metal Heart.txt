Heavy Metal Heart Lyrics
I can feel the heat of the light on my face
As I'm walking away from you
I can feel the beat of the night in my chest
I feel like I'm a galaxy away from you
Yeah, I'm losing myself

Talking to myself in the dark
When my body starts to work like a machine
I can feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart
You make my heavy metal heart beat, beat, oh-oh
Oh, yeah my heavy metal heart, heart, heart, oh-oh
Oh man, you make me feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heartbeat, oh-oh-oh
Oh, my heavy metal heart

I can see a vision that's meant to be mine
Slowly turning away from you
I can see it all standing on top of time
Yeah, there's only one thing for me left to lose
I love losing myself

Talking to myself in the dark
When my body starts to work like a machine
I can feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart
You make my heavy metal heart beat, beat, oh-oh
Oh, yeah my heavy metal heart, heart, heart, oh-oh
Oh man, you make me feel the pulse of my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heartbeat, oh-oh-oh
Oh, my heavy metal heart
You turned my red to black
I'm never coming back
The way I was before
I'm not her anymore, anymore, anymore

You make my heavy metal heart beat
Yeah, my heavy metal heart beat
My heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart
Yeah, my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart
Yeah, my heavy metal heart
Yeah, my heavy metal heart
My heavy metal heart18Embed
