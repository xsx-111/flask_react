I Blame Myself Lyrics
Is it because you know my name?
Or is it because you saw my face on the cover?
Either way, it's all the same
It's like talking to a friend who's trying to be your lover

Underneath it all
I know it's not your fault
That you don't understand
I blame myself

How could you know what it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?
You think you know me so well
How could you know what it feels like to be outside yourself?
You think you know me so well
I just want you to realize I blame, I blame myself
Blame, blame, blame myself
I blame, I blame, blame myself for my reputation

I'm just a face without a choice
I trust youâ€™d never like to guess what I think above these shoulders
10 years old without a voice
I feel like nothing's really changed now I'm just a little older
Underneath it all
I know it's not your fault
That you don't understand
I blame myself

How could you know what it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?
You think you know me so well
How could you know what it feels like to be outside yourself?
You think you know me so well
I just want you to realize I blame, I blame myself
Blame, blame, blame myself
I blame, I blame, blame myself for my reputation

I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself

How could you know what it feels like to fight the hounds of hell?
You think you know me so well
How could you know what it feels like to be outside yourself?
You think you know me so well
I just want you to realize I blame, I blame myself
Blame, blame, blame myself
I blame, I blame, blame myself for my reputation
I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself16Embed
