I Will Lyrics
You wait by the phone
My eyes to your throne
It's what you, what you want from me
It's what you, what you want from me
Pretend that I'm shy
I laugh when you cry
It's what they, what they want from me
It's what they, what they want from me

Try to teach me a lesson
I'll keep, I'll keep you guessing
Oh, I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)
When it's with me you're messing
I'm gonna teach you a lesson
Oh, I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)

I kiss like I lie
You wait for a sign
It's what you, what you want from me
It's what you, what you want from me
Left you dumb, left you damned
Left you limp in your hands
It's what you, what you want from me
It's what you, what you want from me
Try to teach me a lesson
I'll keep, I'll keep you guessing
Oh, I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)
When it's with me you're messing
I'm gonna teach you a lesson
Oh, I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)

Oh, I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will (I will)
I will
I will (I will)
I will (I will)4Embed
