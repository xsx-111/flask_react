Love in Stereo Lyrics
Every time, I tell myself again
That he just wants to be my friend
I can't keep up
He's locked inside my head
But he just wants to be my friend

It's always just stay, it's always just stay
Never just go, never just go
It's always just stay, it's always just stay
Never just go, never just go

We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo
We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo

When he picked me up
What was his intent
Just to let me down again?
I'll survive, but how could I forget
All the things we did back then?
It's always just stay, it's always just stay
Never just go, never just go
It's always just stay, it's always just stay
Never just go, never just go

We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo
We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo

In stereo, in stereo, in stereo
In stereo, in stereo, in stereo

Every time, I tell myself again
I can't keep up, he's locked inside my head
When he picked me up, what was his intent
I'll survive, but how could I forget?

We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo
We fell in love in stereo
Then he broke my heart in stereo
In stereo, in stereo, in stereo
In stereo, in stereo, in stereo14Embed
