24 Hours Lyrics
The seconds run away, minutes passed
At speeds we can run at
As hours start to fade
Deep into night
I’m not in the mood for laughing

It’s slipping away, there’s nothing we can do
It’s slipping away, there’s no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You’re still mine

If this isn't real, just can't deal
In a way you could say, I was always a cynic
Hopeful for awhile
Lost in denial
I wish this could last
Forever
It’s slipping away, there’s nothing we can do
It’s slipping away, there’s no tomorrow without you

I wish these 24 hours would never end
Oh, in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hand
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You’re still mine
I wish these 24 hours
Would never end, oh

I… I…
I… I…
I won’t settle on, I won’t settle on
I won’t settle on
Cause in 24 hours, cause in 24 hours
You’ll be gone, you’ll be gone
You’ll be gone
In 24 hours
For 24 hours
We still have time
For 24 hours
You’re still mine

I wish these 24 hours
Would never end
Oh in these 24 hours
Wish the clock had no hands11Embed
