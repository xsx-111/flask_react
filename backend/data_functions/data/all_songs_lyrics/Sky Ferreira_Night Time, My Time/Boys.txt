Boys Lyrics
I knew it was love

Boys, they're a dime a dozen
Boys, they ain't doin' nothin'
For me any longer
Might be getting stronger
Boys, a lot of women love you
But boys, they just make me mad
All the little things that you do
Ain't gonna make me sad

Then I saw one lookin'
At me from afar

Then I knew it was you all along (I knew it was you, I knew it)
I knew it was you all along (I knew it was you, I knew it)
Suddenly, I knew there was love (I knew it was love, I knew it)
Then I knew it was you all along

You put my faith back in boys
Back in...
Boys, I always see you smilin'
Boys, you never take the blame
All the rotten things that you do
Always getting in my way

Then I saw one looking
At me from afar

Then I knew it was you all along (I knew it was you, I knew it)
I knew it was you all along (I knew it was you, I knew it)
Suddenly, I knew there was love (I knew it was love, I knew it)
Then I knew it was you all along (I knew it was you, I knew it)

You put my faith back in boys
Back in...

Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
Cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
I cross my heart and hope to die
Stick a needle in my eye
Then I knew it was you all along
I knew it was you all along
Suddenly, I knew there was love (I knew it was love, I knew it)
(I knew it was you, I knew it)
(I knew it was you, I knew it)

You put my faith back in boys (I knew it was you, I knew it)
Back in (I knew it was you, I knew it)
Back in boys (I knew it was you, I knew it)
Back in (I knew it was love, I knew it)
Back in boys (I knew it was love, I knew it)
Back in (I knew it was you, I knew it)
(I knew it was you, I knew it)
You put my faith back in boys (I knew it was you, I knew it)
Back in (I knew it was you, I knew it)
Back in boys (I knew it was you, I knew it)
Back in (I knew it was love, I knew it)
Back in boys (I knew it was love, I knew it)
Back in boys14Embed
