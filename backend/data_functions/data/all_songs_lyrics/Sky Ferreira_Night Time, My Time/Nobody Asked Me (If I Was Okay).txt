Nobody Asked Me (If I Was Okay) Lyrics
Never thought I'd have a moment like this
All I want to feel is your kiss
So many words on the tip of my tongue
So many things that you should have done
Right now it hurts that I want you to stay
Nobody asked me if I was okay
In six seconds I count 10 reasons to go
Every day people tell me something else that I know

Yeah, nobody asked me what I wanted
Nobody asked me

I tried to ask you, but nobody asked me
I tried to ask you, but nobody asked me if I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me if I was okay
Nobody asked me

Nobody asked me if I was okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody asked if I was okay

Shaking your head while I try to explain
You say you don't wanna hear me complain
Just tryna get my point across
You don't seem to care if I'm feeling lost
Right now it hurts that I want you to stay
I canâ€™t understand why I feel this way
All the friends I ever had to let go
Every day I hear them saying something else that I know
Yeah, nobody asked me what I wanted
Nobody asked me

I tried to ask you, but nobody asked me
I tried to ask you, but nobody asked me if I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me if I was okay
Nobody asked me

Nobody asked me if I was okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody asked if I was okay

I hear a siren guiding me closer
I hear its echo over and over
And I tried to ask you, I tried to ask you
I tried to ask, but nobody asked

I tried to ask you, but nobody asked me
I tried to ask you, but nobody asked me if I was okay
Nobody asked me, nobody asked me if I was okay
Nobody asked me
Nobody asked me if I was okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody asked if I was okay
Nobody asked me if I was okay
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody asked if I was okay8Embed
