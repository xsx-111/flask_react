Ooh La La Lyrics
Every day, every day, every day, I look
For your car, to pick me up, on the avenue
Driving 'round, take me out, listenin' to the music
Put your lips, on my cheek, that would make me happy

Ooh, la-la
Open up the door, you know I like it (Yeah, I like it, yeah, I like it)
Ooh, la-la
Chivalry was dead but you revived it

You can love me one time
You can love me two, two times
You get more of my time
If you're gonna treat me nice
You can love me one time
You can love me two, two times
You get more of my time
If you're gonna treat me nice

Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Park it up, at my place
Who knows where we might be
You can stay, overnight
If you ask politely

Ooh, la-la
Open up the door, you know I like it (Yeah, I like it, yeah, I like it)
Ooh, la-la
Chivalry was dead but you revived it

You can love me one time
You can love me two, two times
You get more of my time
If you're gonna treat me nice
You can love me one time
You can love me two, two times
You get more of my time
If you're gonna treat me nice

Drivin' fast, drivin' fast, technicolour street lights
Cigarettes on the dash, we can have a sweet time
Baby, where have you been, all of my life?
All of my life, all of my life
Drivin' fast, drivin' fast, technicolour street lights
Cigarettes on the dash, you can have a sweet time
Baby, where have you been, all of my life?
All of my life, all of my life1Embed
