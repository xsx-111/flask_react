Soul Control Lyrics
Can't take my eyes off of you tonight
You're moving like a waterfall
Rush into my life, stay a little while
'Cause I know that we could have it all

Baby, I see the future
It's me and you (Ooh)
We've got to stay in motion
Tell me what you wanna do

Soul control, that's how you want it
Soul control, that's how I give it to you
Soul control, that's how you want it
Soul control, that's how I give it to you

Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like magic
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like— (Woo)
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like magic
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like— (Woo)
You can't take your eyes off of me tonight
Tell me what you came here for
All we need is time, stay a little while
I knew that we could have it all

Let's get a little closer
Crash into me, please
Let's keep these wheels in motion
Tell me what you wanna be

Soul control, that's how you want it
Soul control, that's how I give it to you
Soul control, that's how you want it
Soul control, that's how I give it to you

Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like magic
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like— (Woo)
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like magic
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like— (Woo)
And I wanna give you all my love
I'm addicted to these nights
When it feels like velvet
I can't help myself

Soul control, that's how you want it
Soul control, that's how I give it to you
Soul control, that's how you want it
Soul control, that's how I give it to you

Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like magic
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like— (Woo)
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like magic
Baby, it's automatic
We touch and it feels like— (Woo)4Embed
