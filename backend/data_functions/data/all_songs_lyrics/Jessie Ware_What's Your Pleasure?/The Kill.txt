The Kill Lyrics
You tell me I should run but then you tell me you need me
A lot of places to hide so there's no way you can see me
I wanna swallow my pride but I choke on my own words
You wanna show me your love but forget how to reach me

Tell me what you wanna know
And I'll tell you everything inside
I'll tell you that you are the one for me
Don't try to kill me with your love
Don't kill me with your love

What I don't understand is why I'm here on my own
We were only just talkin' in the silence of your home
I know you better than yourself, you're the only I know
I follow you through the night like a dog with the scent of your cologne

Tell me what you wanna know
And I'll tell you everything inside
I'll tell you that you are the one for me
Don't try to kill me with your love
Don't kill me with your love
Tell me what you wanna know
And I'll tell you everything inside
I'll tell you that you are the one for me
Don't try to kill me with your love
Don't kill me with your love
I've been waiting my whole life for someone who makes me feel like you do
It's complicated, I can't lie to you
I've been waiting my whole life for someone who makes me feel like you do
It's complicated, I can't lie to you
I've been waiting my whole life for someone who makes me feel like you do
It's complicated, I can't lie to you
I've been waiting my whole life for someone who makes me feel like you do
It's complicated, I can't lie to you
I've been waiting my whole life for someone who makes me feel like you do
It's complicated, I can't lie to you5Embed
