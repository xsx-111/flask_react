Read My Lips Lyrics
(Hahaha)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
If you wanna know the truth, read my lips
'Cause they're telling you to make your move, read my lips

We've been talking for a while, boy
I got your message on my phone
I need to talk to you face-to-face
'Cause I don't wanna be alone

If you wanna know the truth, read my lips
'Cause they're telling you to make your move, steal a kiss
Words are never enough, my only wish, is you
Forget about the things I say, read my lips (Yeah)

It seems that you're a little shy, boy
But you keep answering my call
And you and me can talk for hours and hours
Not saying anything at all

If you wanna know the truth, read my lips
'Cause they're telling you to make your move, steal a kiss
Words are never enough, my only wish, is you
Forget about the things I say, read my lips
Don't you know I need you so?
Read my lips, I can't let go
Don't you know I need you so?
Read my lips, I can't let go

And now you're looking in my eyes, boy
And my tongue is gettin' tied
I've been waiting for this moment, darling
Feel the heat, it's getting hot and hot

If you wanna know the truth, read my lips
'Cause they're telling you to make your move, steal a kiss
Words are never enough, my only wish, is you
Forget about the things I say, read my lips

I'm waiting for you (Ooh)
I'm waiting here for you
Yeah, I'll wait here for you, baby (Ooh)
If you want me to
(Don't you know I need you so?) I'm waiting for you all night
(Read my lips, I can't let go) If only you could read my mind, baby
(Don't you know I need you so?)
(Read my lips, I can't let go)
You and me were meant to beEmbed
