Spotlight Lyrics
Ain't enough to say that I think of you
Words can never do the things that I need them to
Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you
'Cause a dream is just a dream and I don't wanna sleep tonight
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)

Do anything to make you stay
Do anything to start the day again (Ah, ah, ah)
If I had everything my way
We'd travel back and forth and back again

If only I could let you go
If only I could be alone
I just wanna stay in the moonlight
This is our time, in the spotlight
If only I could let you go
If only I could be alone
I just wanna stay in the moonlight
This is our time, in the spotlight (Why?)
(Ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah)
It's like you never even left
I need a moment, just a moment (Ah, ah, ah)
Blow me a kiss, I catch your breath
Give me a moment, so devoted

If only I could let you go
If only I could be alone
I just wanna stay in the moonlight
This is our time, in the spotlight (Why?)
If only I could let you go
If only I could be alone
I just wanna stay in the moonlight
This is our time, in the spotlight (Why?)

Can't keep the sun from rising
Can't keep the heart from beating
Can't stop you from believing
Can't keep the sun from rising
Can't keep the air we're breathing
Can't stop your heart from leaving
Can't keep the sun from rising
Can't keep the heart from beating
Can't stop you from believing
Can't keep the sun from rising
Can't keep the air we're breathing
Can't stop your heart from leaving
If only I could let you go
If only I could be alone
I just wanna stay in the moonlight
This is our time, in the spotlight (Why?)
If only I could let you go
If only I could be alone
I just wanna stay in the moonlight
This is our time, in the spotlight

(Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you)
If a dream is just a dream and a dream is just a kiss
Then tell me what it means, tell me what this is
(Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you)
And if a touch is just a touch, then a touch just ain't enough
Tell me what it means, tell me you're in love
(Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you)
If a dream is just a dream and a dream is just a kiss
Then tell me what it means, tell me what this is
(Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you)
And if a touch is just a touch, then a touch just ain't enough
Tell me what it means, tell me you're in love
Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you
Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you
Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you
(Can't keep the sun from rising)
(Can't keep the heart from beating)
(Can't stop you from believing)
Tell me when I'll get more than a dream of you
(Can't keep the sun from rising)
(Can't keep the air we're breathing)
(Can't stop your heart from leaving)3Embed
