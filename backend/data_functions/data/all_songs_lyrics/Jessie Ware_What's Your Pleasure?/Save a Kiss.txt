Save a Kiss Lyrics
High anticipation, it's an emotional trap
Don't know how you do it, you're always striking the match
And I think I'm gonna burn now, but then you touch me like that
Learning to be patient, you save the best for the last

Save a kiss for me tonight
Wait for me, no compromise
Promise you, it won't be long
Just save a little bit of your lovin', baby
Say you want no lips but mine
Save the thought of me tonight
Promise you, it won't be long
Just save a little bit of your lovin', baby
Save a little bit of your love

Save it, save it, save it
Lock it up and keep it with you, baby

That last kiss you gave me, I keep on hittin' rewind
Now I need you, baby, I need another last night
Now my heart is racing, passing all the places we've been
Counting down the minutes 'til I give you all of me
Save a kiss for me tonight
Wait for me, no compromise
Promise you, it won't be long
Just save a little bit of your lovin', baby
Say you want no lips but mine
Save the thought of me tonight
Promise you, it won't be long
Just save a little bit of your lovin', baby
Save a little bit of your love

Save it, save it, save it
Lock it up and keep it with you, baby
Save it, save it, save it
Lock it up and keep it with you, baby

Save a kiss for me tonight (Save it, save it)
Wait for me, no compromise (Lock it up and keep it)
Promise you, it won't be long
Just save a little bit of your lovin', baby
Say you want no lips but mine
Save the thought of me tonight
Promise you, it won't be long
Just save a little bit of your lovin', baby
Save a little bit of your love
Save it, save it, save it
Lock it up and keep it with you, baby3Embed
