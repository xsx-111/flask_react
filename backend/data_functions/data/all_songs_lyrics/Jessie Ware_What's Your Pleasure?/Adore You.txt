Adore You Lyrics
I've never been so sure
Wait, if you want to, you can tell everybody
Tell everybody
There ain't no second best
Stay 'cause I want you
We can tell everybody, tell everybody

I think I'm falling for you
For you
And I know that I adore you
Adore you

I adore you, I adore you
I adore you, I adore you
I adore you, I adore you
I adore you, I adore you
(I adore you)

I wanna give you more that's
All that I want to show everybody
(Show everybody)
I wanna tell the world, want everyone to see
That you belong to me
(Yeah, you belong to me)
I think I'm falling for you
For you (For you, for you, for you)
And I know that I adore you
Adore you (Adore you, adore you, adore you)
And I think I'm falling for you, you
(For you, for you, for you)
I know that I adore you
Adore you (Adore you)
(I adore you)

Snap back, let go
React, tell everybody
Lean in, move slow
Don't go, don't go
Don't go

Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, ooh, oh1Embed
