Remember Where You Are Lyrics
The heart of the city is on fire
Sun on the rise, the highs are gonna fall
But nothing is different in my arms
So darling, remember, remember
Where you are

Do you remember where we are?
I'm no enemy of yours, no, no
When life is hard, that's how it goes
As your destiny unfolds, hold on

To the picture hung on the wall
Sweet reminder before the fall
Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me
To the places we used to go
Sweet reminder, so beautiful
Remember me, remember me
Remember me, remember me

Every day you get up
And look out of the window
Take a breath of morning air
And listen to the people out there
The heart of the city is on fire (The heart of the city is on fire)
Sun on the rise, the highs are gonna fall (The highs are gonna fall)
But nothing is different in my arms (In my arms, in my arms, in my arms)
So darling, remember ('Member), remember ('Member)
Where you are, where you are
Where you are, where you are
(Remember, remember)

We are the last ones of our kind
Freedom of our hearts and mind, oh
Yes, let our bodies testify
And our spirits be entwined forevermore

Every day you get up
And look out of the window
Take a breath of morning air
And listen to the people out there
As the birds are singing
A duet with the morning traffic
What's the one you're hearing?
What's the one you're hearing?

The heart of the city is on fire (The heart of the city is on fire)
Sun on the rise, the highs are gonna fall (The highs are gonna fall)
But nothing is different in my arms (In my arms, in my arms, in my arms)
So darling, remember ('Member), remember ('Member)
Where you are
Can we keep moving in the after hours?
Can we keep loving on the edge of doubt?
You should let me save the day (Oh, yeah)
Please and thank the pain away
Why don't you take me, take me home (Remember, remember)
Can we keep moving in the after hours?
Can we keep loving on the edge of doubt?
You should let me save the day (Oh, yeah)
Please and thank the pain away (Oh, uh-huh)
Why don't you take me, take me home
Can we keep moving in the after hours?
Can we keep loving on the edge of doubt?
You should let me save the day (Oh, yeah)
Please and thank the pain away (Oh, woo)
Why don't you take me, take me home

The heart of the city is on fire
Sun on the rise, the highs are gonna fall
But nothing is different in my arms
So darling, remember, remember
Where you are, where you are3Embed
