Step Into My Life Lyrics
Look into my eyes
When we're together, ain't nothing better
So I'm gonna get ya
But are you worth my while or are you playin'?
That's the question I keep askin' myself

But it feels so right when I feel your eyes
Maybe for tonight, can I feel your body?
Baby, that's enough

Now's the time to step into my life (Ooh)
And it feels so right when you catch my eyes
Maybe for tonight, would you catch my body?
Don't be scared to touch
Now's the time to step into my life

Give into me, show what you're feeling
In harmony, show me you need me, boy

You got my attention, no complications
I just wanna get to know ya
I don't wanna talk, no conversation
I'm tired of wantin' more, more of your love
But it feels so right when I feel your eyes
Maybe for tonight, can I feel your body?
Baby, that's enough

Now's the time to step into my life (Ooh)
And it feels so right when you catch my eyes
Maybe for tonight, would you catch my body?
Don't be scared to touch
Now's the time to step into my life

Give into me
Show what you're feeling
In harmony
Show me you need me, boy
Give into me
Show what you're feeling
In harmony
Show me you need me, boy
Give into me
Show what you're feeling
In harmony
Show me you need me, boy
(Now's the time to step into my life)
Give into me
Show what you're feeling
In harmony
Show me you need me, boy

Give into me
Show what you're feeling
In harmony
Show me you need me, boy
Now's the time to step into my life
Give into me
Show what you're feeling
In harmony
Show me you need me, boy
Now's the time to step into my life
Now's the time to step into my lifeEmbed
