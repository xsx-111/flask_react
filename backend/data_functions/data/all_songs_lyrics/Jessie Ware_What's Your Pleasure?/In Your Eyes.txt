In Your Eyes Lyrics
There were butterflies moving in the light
They were justified every single time
Every time you looked, they were justified
You were here before then you go away
But I never left, I feel just the same
What I wanna know, did something change?

'Cause I can hardly breathe
I'm feeling like I wanna be free from feeling
This pleasure and the pain
But it never goes away
'Cause it's harder to see when you're giving me
Every look I need, I live again
Don't wanna be saved
But what I'm tryna say is that—

It feels like we've been dancing to this song all of our lives
And when you're here, I leave the world behind
But I'm not tryna fight it, I'll just keep on dancing in your eyes
In your eyes

When the music stops, when it's time to leave
Would you walk away? Would you follow me
With no guarantee? 'Cause I'm not afraid
'Cause I can hardly breathe
I'm feeling like I wanna be free from feeling
This pleasure and the pain
But it never goes away
'Cause it's harder to see when you're giving me
Every look I need, I live again
Don't wanna be saved
But what I'm tryna say is that—

It feels like we've been dancing to this song all of our lives
And when you're here, I leave the world behind
But I'm not tryna fight it, I'll just keep on dancing in your eyes
In your eyes

Dancing in your eyes (In your eyes)
Dancing in your eyes ('Cause it's harder to see)
In your eyes
Dancing in your eyes (Don't wanna be saved)
In your eyes
What I'm tryna say is that it feels like
We've been dancing to this song all of our lives
When you're here, I leave the world behind
But I'm not tryna fight it, I'll just keep on dancing...
And it feels, feels like we've been dancing to this song all of our lives
And when you're here, I leave the world behind
But I'm not tryna fight it, I'll just keep on dancing in your eyes
In your eyes

Dancing in your eyes
In your eyes (Dancing in your eyes)
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
(In your eyes, in your eyes, in your eyes)
In your eyes
In your eyes1Embed
