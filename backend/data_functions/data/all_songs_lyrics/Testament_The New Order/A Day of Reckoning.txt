A Day of Reckoning LyricsFirst there came a mass
Brilliant lights of flash
All across the president's skies
As he sits and laughs
He preaches non-conformity
I don't think they see
They live for him and what he believes
A wrath of misery
Left to die alone
In their living past
As he takes their lives away
To never get it back
No more need for society
All the lives he took
The fault of law and majority
Rules in an open book
Leave me alone
Don't take it away
A place where I know
They're destined to take away
Now they lives they lead
Are left to broken dreams
Just when they thought
They had it all
Life's not what it seems
He preaches non-conformity
I don't think they see
They live for him and what he believes
A life of misery
Leave me alone
Don't take it away
A place where I know
They're destined to take away
Don't take away
Society
There'll come a day
You're gonna pay
Day by day a day of reckoning
You're all gonna pay
You can't get awayEmbed
