The Preacher LyricsThe Preacher!!!
In days of old when the books were untold
Speak of a world crushed by sin
"The people will mourn of a war to be born"
Nobody would listen to him
Think back in time when the future you find
Is so faint that it's too hard to see
Don't disavow his word for the truth must be heard
Cause the preacher tells visions he sees
In 1906 like the future predicts
The city will crumble to the bay
Then what's in store when the worlds go to war?
Peace will have come another day
Then came the one in the year of '41
Warfare would light up the sky
He beckoned the call of the future for all
Blinded by what's in his eyes
In days of old when the books were untold
Speak of a world crushed by sin
"The people will mourn of a war to be born"
Nobody would listen to him
Think back in time when the future you find
Is so faint that it's too hard to see
Don't disavow his word for the truth must be heard
Cause the preacher tells visions he sees
Listen to these words I preach
Catastrophic lessons they shall teach...Embed
