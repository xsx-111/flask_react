Into the Pit LyricsDeep in the pit and lying alone
Where death has reared itself a throne
We're all the good, the bad
The worst and the best
And where they land is their eternal rest
Foul plays of passion
At twilight's dim
In joy of woe, of good and sin
Winds of storm and fates overcast
Darkly, my presence is now your past
Join the insanity
Or die as you fall
Into the pit
The mass production
And the killing of all
Into the pit
The future screams for help
Are fading away
Into the pit
The world tomorrow
Will it die for today?
Into the pit
So in the sad, silent watches of night
The lonely pathway envisions my sight
Echoes of laughter
And boundless cries
So here I wander under infinite skies
Join the insanity
Or die as you fall
Into the pit
The mass production
And the killing of all
Into the pit
The future screams for help
Are fading away
Into the pit
The world tomorrow
Will it die for today?
