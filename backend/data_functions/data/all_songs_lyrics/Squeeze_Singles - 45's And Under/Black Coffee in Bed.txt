Black Coffee in Bed Lyrics
There's a stain on my notebook where your coffee cup was
And there's ash in the pages, now I've got myself lost
I was writing to tell you that my feelings tonight
Are a stain on my notebook that rings your goodbye

Oh, now she's gone
And I'm back on the beat
A stain on my notebook
Says nothing to me
Oh, now she's gone
And I'm out with a friend (out with a friend)
With lips full of passion
And coffee in bed

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

With the way that you left me, I can hardly contain
(Hardly contain)
The hurt and the anger and the joy of the pain
(Joy of the pain)
Now knowing I'm single, there'll be fire in my eyes
(Fire in my eyes)
And a stain on my notebook for a new love tonight
(New love tonight)
Oh, now she's gone
And I'm back on the beat
A stain on my notebook
Says nothing to me
Oh, now she's gone
And I'm out with a friend (out with a friend)
With lips full of passion
And coffee in bed

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)


Oh, now she's gone
And I'm out with a friend (out with a friend)
With lips full of passion (ooh)
And coffee in bed

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, from lips without passion to the lips with a kiss
There's nothing of your love that I'll ever miss
The stain on my notebook remains all that's left
Of the memory of late nights and coffee in bed
Of the memory of late nights and coffee in bed

Now she's gone
And I'm back on the beat
Oh, a stain on my notebook
Says nothing to me
Oh, now she's gone (now she's gone)
And I'm out with a friend (out with a friend)
With lips full of passion (ooh)
And coffee in bed

(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now she's gone (black coffee in bed)
And I'm back on the beat (black, black coffee in bed)
A stain on my notebook (black, black, black coffee in bed)
Says nothing to me (black coffee in bed)
Now she's gone (black, black coffee in bed)
And I'm back on the beat (black, black, black coffee in bed)
A stain on my notebook (black coffee in bed)
Says nothing to me (black, black coffee in bed)
(Black, black, black) Oh, coffee in bed
(Black) coffee in bed
(Black, black coffee in bed)
(Black, black, black coffee in bed)
(Black coffee in bed)
(Black, black coffee in bed)
(Black, black, black coffee in bed)
(Black coffee in bed)
(Black, black coffee in bed)
(Black, black, black coffee in bed)Embed
