Goodbye Girl Lyrics
I met her in a BAR ROOM
Her name I didn't catch
She looked like something special
The kind who'd understand
The room was almost spinning
She pulled another smile
She had the grace like pleasure
She had a certain style

Sunlight on the lino
Woke me with a shake
I looked around to find her
But she'd gone
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl

She took me to her hotel
A room on the second floor
A kettle and two coffees
A number on the door
She said I hardly know you
Agreed we kissed goodnight
I knew that in the morning
Somehow I'd wake to find
Sunlight on the lino
Waking me with a shake
I looked around to find her
But she'd gone
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl

I've lost my silver BRACELET
My club room locker keys
The money in the BILLFOLD
It doesn't bother me
My wife has moved to BOSTON
So Mug is not the word
If you ever see her
Say hello goodbye girl


Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl
Goodbye girl1Embed
