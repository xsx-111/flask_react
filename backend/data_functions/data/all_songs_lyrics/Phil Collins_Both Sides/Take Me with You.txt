Take Me with You Lyrics
If you see the light on in the window of my room
I'll be looking out though the shades are drawn
If you should hear someone quietly calling out for your hair
Don't be alarmed it might just be me

Take me with you, take me there
I'll go with you anywhere
Show me all the things you know
Are you with me, are you there
I'll be with you everywhere
Show me all the things you know, you know, you know, you know

The sun always seems to shine on the other side of the mountain
The water is clearer on the other side of the hill
All that water comes to me, ooh as i lay down
Where i am is where i should be


I'm holding them close to me
All those things i learned
But there's no questions and answers
So we watch the candle burn, on and on
So the candle burns all night, burns so bright until morning
When i wake i find myself alone
So if you see me - are you here? - hear someone cry, calling out
Rescue me and take me home - take me home


Please take me, show me
Just take me, show meEmbed
