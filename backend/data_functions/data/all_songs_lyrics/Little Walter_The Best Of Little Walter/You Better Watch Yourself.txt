You Better Watch Yourself LyricsYou better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
'Cause I've got my eyes on you
You can steal my love, and go away
Don't tell me you'll see me another day
You got to watch yourself
You got to watch yourself
You got to watch yourself
'Cause I've got my eyes on you
You've gone and left me, you left me here to cry
You know I love you, you know you might sigh
You got to watch yourself
Watch yourself
You got to watch yourself
'Cause I've got my eyes on you
I gave you all my money, everything too
A fine Cadillac, tell me, whatcha gonna do
Watch yourself
You got to watch yourself
You got to watch yourself
'Cause I've got my eyes on you
Well the people are all talkin', all over town
Say you don't love me, you're gonna let me down
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
'Cause I've got my eyes on you
Tell me what's the matter, whatcha gonna do?
Well you're gonna quit me, then you say you're through
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
'Cause I've got my eyes on you
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
'Cause I've got my eyes on youEmbed
