Last Night LyricsLast night
I lost the best friend I ever had
Now you gone and left me
That makes me feel so bad
Well now it's early in the mornin'
And my love is comin' down for you
Early in the mornin'
And my love is comin' down for you
I want you to tell me baby
Baby what are we gonna do
I'm gonna wait 'til tomorrow
They tell me every day brings about a change
I'm gonna wait 'til tomorrow
They tell me every day brings about a change
I love you, love you babe
You know that is a crying shameEmbed
