Blues With A Feeling LyricsBlues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
I'm gonna find my baby
If it takes all night and day
What a lonesome feelin'
When you're by yourself
What a lonesome feelin'
When you're by yourself
When the one that you're lovin'
Have gone away and left
Well you know I love you baby
I wonder the reason why
You gone and left me baby
Then you left me here to cry
Blues with a feelin'
That's what I have today
I'm gonna find my baby
If it takes all night and dayEmbed
