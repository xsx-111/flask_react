Gospel Train LyricsCome on, people, got to get on board
Train is leavin' and there's room for one more
God, don't listen to the devil, he got ways to move you
This train don't carry no smokers, this train
Well, come on, people 'cause it's startin to rain
Get on board, it's the gospel train, yeah
Don't listen to the devil now
People, don't listen to the devil
Satan will fool you
Satan will fool you
I said Satan will fool you
Well this train don't carry no smokers
This train

Come on people, get on board
Train is leavin' and there's room for one more
Just trust in the Lord
Wooo

Come on, people, 'cause it's starting to rain
Get on board, ride the gospel train
Don't listen to the devil
He got ways to move youEmbed
