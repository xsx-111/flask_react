The Briar and the Rose LyricsI fell asleep down by the stream
And there I had the strangest dream
And down by Brennan's Glenn
There grows a briar and a rose
There's a tree in a forest, but I don't know where
I built a nest out of your hair
And climbing up into the air
A briar and a rose
I don't know how long it has been
But I was born in Brennan's Glenn
And near the end of spring
There grows a briar and a rose
I picked the rose one early morn
I pricked my finger on a thorn
They'd grown so close
Their winding wove the briar around the rose
I tried to tear them both apart
I felt a bullet in my heart
And all dressed up in spring's new clothes
The briar and the rose
And when I'm buried in my grave
Tell me so I will know
Your tears will fall to make love grow
The briar and the rose
When I'm buried in my grave
Tell me so I will know
Your tears will fall to make them grow
The briar and the rose
Your tears will fall to make them grow
The briar and the roseEmbed
