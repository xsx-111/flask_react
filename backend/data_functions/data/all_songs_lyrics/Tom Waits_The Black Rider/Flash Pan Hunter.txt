Flash Pan Hunter LyricsThe flash pan hunter sways with the wind
And his rifle is the sound of the morning
Each sulfurous bullet must have its own wit
And each cartridge comes with a warning
Beware of elaborate telescopic meat
It will find its way back to the forest
For Wilhelm can't wait to be Peg Leg's crown
And the briar is strangling the rose back down
His back shall be my slender new branch
It will bend, it will sway in the breeze
As the Devil does his polka with a hatchet in his hand
As a sniper in the branches of the trees
As the vulture flutters down, as the snake sheds his dove
Wilhelm's cutting off his fingers, so they'll fit into the glove
For Wilhelm can't wait to be Peg Leg's crown
And the briar is strangling the rose back down
The briar is strangling the rose back downEmbed
