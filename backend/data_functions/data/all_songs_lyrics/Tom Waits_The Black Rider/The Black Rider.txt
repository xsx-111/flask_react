The Black Rider LyricsCome on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Lay down in the web of the black spider
I'll drink your blood like wine
So come on in
It ain't no sin
Take off your skin
And dance around in your bones
So come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Step right up and hold right on there, little
Have your tickets ready, under twelve are free
Anchors away with the Black Rider
I'll drink your blood like wine
I'll drop you off in Harlem with the Black Rider
Out where the bullets shine
And when you're done, you'll cock your gun
The blood will run like ribbons through your hair
Just come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old time
Lines form to the left
Have your tickets ready
See the dog-faced boy
Come on along with the Black Rider
I've got just the thing for thee
Come on along with the Black Rider
I want your company
I'll have the veal, a lovely meal
That's how I feel, may I use your skull for a bowl?
Just come on along with the Black Rider
We'll have a gay old
We'll have a gay old
We'll have a gay old
We'll have a gay old
We'll have a gay old timeEmbed
