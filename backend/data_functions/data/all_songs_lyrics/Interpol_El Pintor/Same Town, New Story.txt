Same Town, New Story Lyrics
Same town, new story
They bridged a fated span
He was bound for a glory
She found her winning man

So I bet she stood by him
Through it all
I bet she stood by him
She was pounding on the wall

She said it feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders
Feels like the whole world's coming down on me
Frightening

How many bombs went off?
Cause he just had to play his hand
His lot is a woman's duty
And she was always tougher than (Same town, new story)
She said who's gonna save them from you (Same town, new story)
Who's gonna save them from you (Same town, new story)
I ain't gonna chase another stake until he's gone
So I bet she stood by him to the law
I bet she stood by him when he was down
On his knees
She said "We're still alive
We are still alive"

Feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders (coming down)
Feels like the whole world
Is up on my shoulders (coming down)
Feels like the whole world's coming
Down on me

Wide eyed, venture so slowly
Venture so slowly
Wide eyed, venture so slowly
Wide eyed, venture so slowly
Venture so slowly
Why do I venture so slowly?
Venture so slowly7Embed
