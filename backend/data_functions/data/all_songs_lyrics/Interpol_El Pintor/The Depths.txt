The Depths Lyrics
Innocent idols who turn me on
While selling bibles to babies
We sleep for a while, but then you are gone
And all I have left is the story

All I can see before me is the darkest blues
Because I sink to the depths without you

If I met a waitress could she turn me on
I think I got the time to let her know me
I keep my focus, but my dreams keeps me strong
I come abreast of it slowly

All I can see before me is the darkest blue
Because I sink to the depths without you (To you, my love)
So many hours you are receiving from me (To you, my love)
Now the stars are out of view (To you, my love)
Because I sink to the depths without you, girl (To you, my love)2Embed
