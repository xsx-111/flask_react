My Blue Supreme Lyrics
Fade out
You've already made a scene around me
Fade now
Just say that in the way you go by
It's my own time (cruising in my blue Supreme)
It's my own time

When love comes, honey, take it
Only one in a hundred make it
We fake until there's nothing to fake

There's someone that I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue Supreme

Fade
You've already captured me alone
Fake out
Just say it in the way you go by
It's my own time, my own time

There's someone that I'm dying to be
Cruising in my blue Supreme
Someone that I'm dying to be (cruising in my blue)
Someone that I'm dying to be (cruising in my blue)
Cruising in my blue Supreme
Just say it in the way you go by
My own time (cruising in my blue Supreme)

When love comes, honey, show it
So many of us blow it
This kind of shit don't heal in a week
Cruising in my blue Supreme

Cruising in my blue Supreme
Someone that I'm dying to be (cruising in my blue)
But nothing ever comes for free (cruising in my blue)
Cruising in my blue Supreme (in my blue Supreme)
Something that I'm trying to create
Just me alone my shoes and some shake (cruising in my blue)
Cruising in my blue Supreme8Embed
