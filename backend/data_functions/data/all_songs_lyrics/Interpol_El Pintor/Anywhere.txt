Anywhere Lyrics
We try to invade
Put some of us in each
At least try hold the other
In the right light
This sky's gonna break
Some of us die heroes
At least they'll never suffer
At least they'll always

See the ocean
Cause I could go anywhere
I could go anywhere
So free in my place in the sun
Cause I could go anywhere

You know all about me
That's what's so frightening
You know all about me
Seems my moon is traveling

We try to engage
Softened up by peace
At least I had my taste
Of the nightlife
Be kind to the babes
Cause someday you might need them
At least they'll never suffer
At least they'll always
See the ocean
Cause I could go anywhere
I could go anywhere
So free my nature to run
Cause I could go anywhere

You know all about me
That's what's so frightening
You know all about me
Seems my moon is traveling
You know all about me
I won't be tied with heartstrings
I search high and low
Seems my moon is traveling
Always

See the ocean
Cause I could go anywhere
Besides my only care's me
My face in the sun
Cause I could go anywhere1Embed
