Sleeper in the Valley LyricsIn a green hollow
Where a river sings
Tiny valley
Blue bells rings
There's a young soldier
Under the clouds
His mouth is open
And the light rains down
And the light rains down
And the crows come 'round
To the two red holes
In his right side, oh
Sleeping in the sun
His hand on his breast
Nape of his neck
The blue watercress
He's just a kid
And he never knew
He would be
The sleeper in the valley so soon
So soon, so soon
And the crows, they swoon
At the two red holes
In his right side, oh
So soon, so soon
And the crows, they swoon
At the two red holes
In his right side, oh
In his right sideEmbed
