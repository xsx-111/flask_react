Silo Song LyricsDreaming of a silver silo burning in the light
Venus de Milo soldered in the side
Thought I caught her smile
Am I going, am I going up in smoke
Am I going, am I going up in smoke
Dreaming of birds of prey at battle
On a burning saddle, a rider lost in flames
What of all the games she played with beauty and love
Have I gone up in smoke
Have I come up, have I come up in smoke
Have I come up, have I come up in smoke
Venus de Milo calls
Venus de Milo fallsEmbed
