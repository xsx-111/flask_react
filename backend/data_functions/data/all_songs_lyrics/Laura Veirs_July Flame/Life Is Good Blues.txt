Life Is Good Blues LyricsLife is good when you dance all night
And the world transmits electric power
Messages you send to mars
Came from a crown of flowers
Have we danced away the hours?
Have you danced away the hours?
Life is good when the band is smokin' hot
The drummer drums, cause it's the last chance that he got
Boats light up the river in a string of flame
Life is good
When you know he feels the same thing
When you know he feels the same thing
Go in soft like the dawn
And tender green like the shoots of spring
Unfurling on the lawn
Over dale, over dale
Over sea swell, over sea swell
Never play the devil's pawn
Cause you know he'd do the same thing
Yeah you know he'd do the same thingEmbed
