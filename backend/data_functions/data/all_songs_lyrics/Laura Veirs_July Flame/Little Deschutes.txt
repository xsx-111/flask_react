Little Deschutes LyricsIt sure is hard to dance across
The room when you've got
One foot on the floor
And one foot outside the door
I want nothing more
Than to dance with you
The peace i've known, floating along
The deep green river with you and a song
Is something like the peace i hope
To make with you my whole life long
I want nothing more
Than to float with you
Paddling through the hail storm
Clothes ravaged, the leaves all torn
A part of me was born
Why care about yesterday's haze
When the stars above are all ablaze?
Why care about the coming dawn
When the moon pours now, its searchlight strong?
I want nothing more
Than to dance with you
I want nothing more
Than to float with youEmbed
