July Flame LyricsJuly Flame
Firey kind
Will always
Lead me through the night
July Flame
Sweet summer peach
High up in the branch
Just out of my reach
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
July Flame
I'm seeing fireworks
They're so beautiful
Tell me why it hurts
July Flame
Ashes of a secret heart
Falling in my lemonade
Unslakable thirsting in the backyard
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?
Can I call you mine?Embed
