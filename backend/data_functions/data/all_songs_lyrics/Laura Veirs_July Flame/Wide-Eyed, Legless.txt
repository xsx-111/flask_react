Wide-Eyed, Legless LyricsDown among the dead the wide-eyed
And the legless only half ahead
Half a mouth to laugh in the porthole
With the mold and faded epitaphs
Will you evermore tie up my hair with velvet bows
Will you evermore pull out the splinters from my toes
I don't think so
Out in the hornet rain the swarming stingers
Pumping poison through my veins
Lying on the star-cross lovers map
Take the beating, lash, lash for lash
Will we evermore kiss on the boardwalk's fading rail
In the light of the waves and the comet's waning tail
I don't think so
No more looking back, looking back
Looking back, faded epitaphsEmbed
