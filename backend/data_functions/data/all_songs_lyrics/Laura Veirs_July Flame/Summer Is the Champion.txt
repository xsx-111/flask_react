Summer Is the Champion LyricsHoney wax
Melt it down
Make your heart
Molten somehow
Turn the fields of stone to magma
Swinging out
On the breeze
I hear you singing
You're coming home
I can see you now

Summer is the champion
Let's get dizzy in the grass
Makers and melters, oh my, honey wax
Thought I needed
Rodent teeth
Tough iron filings
Diamonds cut
Bright steely shining
All the trouble that I've seen
Came on their wings
I threw them away
To rust in the rain
(Don't search 'em out)
Summer is the champion
Let's get dizzy in the grass
Makers and melters, oh my, honey wax
Summer is the champion
Let's get dizzy in the grass
Makers and melters, oh my, honey wax
Summer is the champion
Let's get dizzy in the grass
Makers and melters, oh your, honey waxEmbed
