Sun Is King LyricsEven the most shimmering rain
Empties out the sky and comes to an end
We all know that the sun is king
There's no messing with our orbiting
So why is he standing in his own backyard
Crying at his fallen down house of card?
Did you see the ice in his eye?
Did you see the dagger caught in his smile?
Innocent as a summer flower
With a serpent coiled under his collar
So why is he standing in his own backyard
Crying at his fallen down house of card?Embed
