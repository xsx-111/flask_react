Carol Kaye LyricsShe can really play it
She can really lay it down
"Smile," "Good Vibrations"
"Help Me Rhonda," "Homeward Bound"
It would be so cool to be like Carol, Carol Kaye
Maybe I can meet her, maybe shake her hand one day
"Songs of Innocence"
"Natural Man," "Feelin' Alright"
"I'm a Believer"
"Come together," "In the Heat of the Night"
"Mission Impossible," oh she's "Out of this World"
Ten thousand sessions from an
Everett, Washington girl
Not a household name but she's been in your head all day
It would be so cool to be like Carol, Carol KayeEmbed
