When You Give Your Heart LyricsSince you lay my burdens
Since you lay my burdens
Since you lay my burdens down
All the troubles I been
Dragging down this trail
Seep into the thirsty ground
Since you turned your light
Upon my darkened dale
The pollinators flex their wings
And take into the air
Spin their emeraldine
Webs across the swales and prairies
And my stampeding buffalo
Stops in her tracks and watches the snow
Falling through the old oak tree
When you give your heart to me
This is my song of love
Gathered from stuff above
The wires, feathers and clouds
This is a song for you
A spring comes bubbling through
The place whenever you're around
And my stampeding buffalo
Stops in her tracks and watches the snow
Falling through the old oak tree
When you give your heart to meEmbed
