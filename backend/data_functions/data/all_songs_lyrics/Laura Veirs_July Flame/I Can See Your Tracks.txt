I Can See Your Tracks LyricsOh, I can see your tracks
But I won't follow them
I'll just hope for rain
Some kind of crazy wind
To erase them, chase them
Into oblivion
Oh, I can smell the smoke
From your fire, babe
But I'll leave you alone
And sleep in this lonely cave
Pray for the storm to
Scrub this dirt away
I can hear the snakes
Creeping 'cross the scene
I'm quaking in my boots
But you won't hear me scream
I'm halfway down to New Orleans
You're halfway down to New OrleansEmbed
