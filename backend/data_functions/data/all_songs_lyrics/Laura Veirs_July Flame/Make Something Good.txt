Make Something Good LyricsI wanted to make something sweet
The blood inside a maple tree
The sunlight trapped inside the wood
Make something good
I wanted to make something strong
An organ pipe in a cathedral
That stays in tune through a thousand blooms
Make something good

It's a gonna take a long, long time
But we're gonna make something so fine
I wanted to make something pure
An emerald field from steer manure
A wild-eyed child in a moonlit room
Make something good
I wanted to make something built to last
A bottled ship with a golden mast
And through the squall the course stays true
Make something good
Make something good

It's gonna take a long, long time
But we're gonna make something so fine
It's gonna take a long, long time
But we're gonna make something so fineEmbed
