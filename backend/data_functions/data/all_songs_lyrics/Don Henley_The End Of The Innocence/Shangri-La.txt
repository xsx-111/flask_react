Shangri-La LyricsEvery day's a new day
That's what I've been told
Try to hold your head high
The world runs hot and cold
It's hard to follow footprints
In the shifting sand
Another thirsty rider
Behind the caravan
You had no idea
Just what was waiting out there
You never thought you'd carry the weight
Of the world
On your pretty blond hair
This ain't no shangri-la
To you no shangri-la
This ain't no shangri-la
Nobody knows no shangri-la
Hey! there's a whole lotta people
Wonderin' who you are
They think you walk without a care in the world
But they've been wrong so far
This ain't no shangri-la
To you no shangri-la
This ain't no shangri-la
Nobody knows no shangri-laEmbed
