The Heart of the Matter Lyrics
I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone

And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me
And you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

But I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew
I'm learning again

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive
In such a graceless age?

The trust and self-assurance
That lead to happiness
They're the very things
We kill, I guess
Oh, pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out
I have to learn again

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore
There are people in your life
Who've come and gone
They let you down
You know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you, baby
Cause life goes on
You keep carrying that anger
It'll eat you up inside, baby

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinking about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me
Forgiveness
(Yeah)
Forgiveness
(Baby)
Forgiveness
(Oh, oh)
Forgiveness
(Ah, yeah)
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
Even if
You don't love me anymore
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
(Ohh)
Forgiveness
Forgiveness
(heyy yeah)2Embed
