I Will Not Go Quietly LyricsWoke up with a heavy head
And I thought about leavin' town
I could have died if I wanted to
Slipped over the edge and drowned
But, oh no baby
I won't give up that easy, no
Too many tire tracks in the sands of time
Too many love affairs that stop on a dime, well
Oh baby
Think it's time to make some changes 'round here
Yeah, I'm gonna tear it up
Gonna trash it up
I'm gonna round it up
Gonna shake it up
Oh now baby, I will not lie down
I'm brave enough to be crazy
Strong enough to be weak
I see all these heroes with feet of clay
Whose mighty ships have sprung a leak
And I want you to tell me darlin'
Just what do you believe in now?
Well, come on over here baby
You 'bout to gimme a heart attack
Wanna wrap my lovin' arms
Around the small of your back
Yeah and I'm gonna pull you, pull you, pull you
Pull you right up close to me, yeah
Yeah, we're gonna tear it up
We gonna trash it up
Gonna round it up
Gonna shake it up
Oh no no no, I will not lie down
Turn this thing around
I will not go quietly
I will not lie down
I will not go quietly
I will not lie down
I will not go quietly
I will not lie down
No, I will not lie down, no
Well, don't you ever get lonely?
Don't you ever get down?
Don't you ever get tired
Of all the wicked tongues in this town?
Ooh baby, just wanna take you away from here
I ain't no tiger
Ain't no little lamb
Suppose you tell me mama
Who do you think I think I am?
Oh baby, don't you give a damn?
Yeah, I'm gonna tear it up
Gonna trash it up
Gonna round it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Ooh baby, I will not lie down
Turn this thing around
I will not go quietly
I will not lie down
I will not go quietly
I will not lie down
I will not go quietly
I will not lie down
No, I will not lie down, noEmbed
