Playa Hataz Lyrics
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (Talkin' that shit)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (Talkin' that shit)

Demonic mind, why must I love to take so many lives?
Why do I leave them suffering laying there to die?
Why do I send their mother pictures? Just﻿ to watch them cry
Why does the devil use me to commit these evil crimes?
Why must I inflict all these multiple stab wounds?
I'm grabbing the butcher knife
How come I must torture and paralyze victims
Before I'm truely satisfied
I cannot stop tryin' to prove to myself
That I am a weaponary master
So I seem to keep stocking with silencers
Bodies are scattered all over the pasture

Playa hatin' fools, for you fools I got them tools
Tools like the Glock 19 Blasting on the scene
Sumthin' like a nightmare in your dreams
Mean with them guns you can't run leavin' bodies numb
H-to-the-K one I spray, Juicy J bar none
I'm always hearin' shit about my niggas in the Three 6 Mafia
Prophet Entertainment on the rise, bitch
You fools don't know when I roll up on ya
I will have to spray ya
This goes out to the mothafuckers who doubt
Jealous playa hataz
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (Talkin' that shit)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you–I hold your head down and I fuck you like a convict, bitch (Talkin' that shit)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (Talkin' that shit)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you–I hold your head down and I fuck you like a convict, bitch (Talkin' that shit)

This goes out to all you suckas
Playa hating mothafuckers
Jealousy is in you bustas
Ho, you know I'm really bumpin'
Triple Six is blastin' bitches, robbin' riches, that's the scoop
Playa hataz mothafucker hate the shit by Gangsta Boo
Nigga just remember all the killas just ain't in yo' hood
Triple Six is all around yo' ass now, hoe, I wish you would
Test this fuckin' playa playa hataz better listen close
Now go run for help my .32 will bring you to the flo' (Flo')

Jumpin' out of the house
Fresh black Jordans on my feet
I'm trippin' out off of some rumors
Some bustas said I got killed last week
But the devils don't die, just get high
Fool you don't even not hear me though
And if it's true
Then that's the resurrection of the Three 6 Mafia h-izz-oe
Let me break it down for the rumor stars:
Who forced this untrue lisp to go 'round
Sendin' clowns with gun down Jakers live not in the M-Town, check
But there's some playa hata goin' home so I got a kinda life stay striz Bout
Another fresh paint job and the Chevy thang
Artey Bose but I'm still goin' to miss out
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you playa hataz who be talkin' that shit (Talkin' that shit)
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you–I hold your head down and I fuck you like a convict, bitch (Talkin' that shit)
Talkin' that shit
This for all you, this for all you
This for all you, this for all you playa hataz who be talkin' that shit
Talkin' that shi–
Talkin' that shi–
Talkin' that shi–7Embed
