Charging These Hoes Lyrics
What, what them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What, what them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What, what them niggas doing? Charging these hoes

What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing?
(Hoes, hoes, ain't nothing but hoes)
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What, what them niggas doing?

What the true playas doing? Oh, they making these hoes
Pay the muthafuckin' cost, to the real muthafuckin' boss
Pimpin' is how I make my living, you fools need to keep down
Bitch, that's why you getting poor, I'm sturdy getting rich
Why they payin' these hoes like that? 
Bitch to be chewing 'n screwin' her whole fuckin' back out
And not get a dime let out, for what? Hoe, I don't need ya
What? I'm gonna eat ya, bitch I'm 'bout to beat ya
And what's up with them hoes who made the song "Chewing Ass Nigga"
Tramp-ass bitches, you forgot that I had the picture from the camcorder
In the closet, caught you hoes slipping
These bitches be getting mad when they hear their name on the tape, they start to tripping
That's how it is fucking with a (draykcaB) nigga
My nigga Lord Infamous got fingers on the trigger
Aimin' for your face, lettin' you hoes know the score
Yo Juicy, what them niggas doing? (They charging these hoes, mane)
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing?
(Hoes, hoes, ain't nothing but hoes)
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What, what them niggas doing?

I met a little freak bitch, who always wore tight shit
Had five kids and her pussy had a tight grip
The first of the month came, the first of the month came
I saw the mailman coming now it's time to run game
Give me half the check, bitch, niggas like me never quit
Big nose red bitch, let your lips meet my dick
Pay up the money for the running of my cum on your tongue
Juicy "Low Down" J will never get sprung
Never was your friend, see? All a nigga want is cheese
McDonald's, Crystal's, Burger King, Wendy's
Whatever kind of check it is, chargin' hoes is my biz'
D-Magic, Project Pat, I know my nigga down for his
Yeah, you hoes know the score -- Wanna fuck? Gimme the dough
Credit cards, crazy checks, all that type of shit will go
To you little dirty freaks, keep my name outcha' mouth
Unless you want a job, bitch, that's what I'm talking about
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing?
(Hoes, hoes, ain't nothing but hoes)
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What them niggas doing? Charging these hoes
What, what them niggas doing?3Embed
