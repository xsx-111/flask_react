Smoking the Day Away LyricsI was walking in a forest
Enchanted by an apple
Trees they were so friendly
Though I felt very small
Came upon a clearing
Laid down upon the grass
Somehow I've been here before
But I knew that wouldn't last
Smoking the day
Sorry I could not stay
Crimson yellow sunrays
They glimmered in the creek
Whence which by my patience
See the dancing leaves
Smoking the day
Sorry I could not stay
The sun now fades in to the hill
Deepening as it fades
Soon the day, the day will end
And I know I must return
Looking back we're walking
After dark your words
I cannot help but thinking
That grains may hold the truth
Smoking the day
Sorry I could not stay1Embed
