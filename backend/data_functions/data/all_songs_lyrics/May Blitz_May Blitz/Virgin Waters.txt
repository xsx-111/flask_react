Virgin Waters LyricsWho are you, I do not know
Where am I, can it be so
Is this world, a different place
Why can't we go straight to base
Never seen such beauty
From the sky dropped to the ground
Swirling tumbling dancing as the land falls all around
Orchard scarlet faces swaying in the breeze
Surrounded by this power
Do you feel, do you feel life is good
Living it, living it the way you should
How could I ever get sad
Watching you just makes me glad
Sun now sails it reveals what's happening over there
Look, upon the water as the moonbeams now appear
I sit alone on the shore darkness drops its mask
Beside me now a feeling I had waiting to be castEmbed
