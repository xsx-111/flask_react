Dreaming LyricsFell into another world
Love was all around
Man was great, created equal
No one was, was a clown
Happiness, happiness was everywhere
Why can't it be this way, why can't it be?
I'm only dreaming
I'm only dreaming
I'm only dreaming
Dreaming
Back in our world
Hate is all around
Man was never created equal
Everyone's a clown
Sadness hides amongst us
They say there's no food to go around
Walls are getting me almost blind
My life's going to ground
Met some people, met some people living there
Who told me who, who I was
They told me, they told me where I had come from
They even knew, knew my course
I told them, I told them I was searching
Why can't it be this way, why can't it be?
I'm only dreaming
Yes, I'm only dreaming
Mmm, dreamingEmbed
