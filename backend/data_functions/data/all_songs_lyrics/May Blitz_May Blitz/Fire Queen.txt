Fire Queen LyricsWell the Fire Queen she's the devil's bride
When that woman comes you better run and hide
Fire Queen she's 9 feet tall
With an evil mind that must know all
Fire Queen she's running fast
Fantastic body long blue hair
Fire Queen she's here tonight
That's the one that brought her now
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Well the Fire Queen she's hot as coal
Gonna enlighten your mind gonna fill my soul
Fire Queen she burns right through
Into your body she loves that too
Fire Queen on the floor in hell
Lay down you know you can't go nowhere
Fire Queen when she looks at you
Flaming eyes can see all of you
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Well the Fire Queen she's the devil's bride
When that woman comes you better run and hide
Fire Queen she's 9 feet tall
With an evil mind that must know all
Fire Queen she's running fast
Fantastic body long blue hair
Fire Queen she's here tonight
That's the one that brought her now
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire Queen
Fire, Fire Queen, fire, Fire QueenEmbed
