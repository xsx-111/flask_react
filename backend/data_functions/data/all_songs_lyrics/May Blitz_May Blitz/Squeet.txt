Squeet LyricsSqueet
All over a wall...
Dying to have a ball
It's, it's been too long
I feel, I feel it coming on
Squeet, all over the wall
Squeet, all over the wall
Squeet, all over the wall
Love, love to have you love me
I, I know you can do it right
C'mon, c'mon now show me
Let's squeet away the night
Squeet, all over the wall
Squeet, all over the wall
Squeet, all over the wallEmbed
