Tomorrow May Come LyricsColor blue from fire flames that burns within
Above somewhere, where no one knows and no one yet has been
There waits, but for what it waits, a vision strange and clear
An unknown space, complete around of shapes that are to be
Smoothness do I feel, purple dreams of velvet glows
Tomorrow may come
Beyond the edge that one can see colors do appear
Flashing blues, from a far off source, ultraviolet waves
Alone up here but not alone flying in it all
A cosmic dream, of truthful tales within a distant glow
Silken white and satin water, flowing through these eyes
Tomorrow may come
Tomorrow, tomorrow that may come
Tomorrow, that may come
Tomorrow that may, that may comeEmbed
