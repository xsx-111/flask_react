Wet Sand Lyrics
My shadow side, so amplified, keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary sun, but it's so—
My love affair, with everywhere, was innocent
Why do you care?
Someone start the car, time to go
You're the best I know

My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting that, when we collide, the universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro

My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
God knows that I really tried
My, what a good day for a— Take out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better of–

I saw you there so unaware, those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary sun, but it's so—
The disrepair of Norma Jean could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty goin' toe to toe
My, what a good day for a— Let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better of–

I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter
Yeah!

(Uuh-uh-uh)
Right on the verge, just one more dose
I'm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect, but it's close
(Uuh-uh-uh)
I'm almost there, why should I care?
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show

My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better of–
Yeah!
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter

Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do, yeah
You don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do
Yeah!
