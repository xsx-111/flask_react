Make You Feel Better Lyrics
One, two
If I want to—

She's the one, she's the only one
She's got ripped back light, gonna make me come
I say, when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile

I said, now I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

Pick a star in the open sky
I see you (Ah-ah) see me and that is why
I hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel (Ah-ah) your fire jump up to meet

I said, now I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better
(Oh, yeah!)
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set (Ah-ah) my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched (Ah-ah) out mouth and a pack of style

I say, she's the one, she's the only one
Make me search (Ah-ah) myself until I'm done, and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea (Ah-ah) of stars make a diagram?
And—

Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better

Oh, yeah!
Hey, yeah!
Hey!
(Oh, yeah!)

So alive, I arrive on dust
You can search (Ah-ah) my mind for the red on rust
I said, take me there and she really cares
Lighten up (Ah-ah) for me, gonna hear my prayers
I said—
Now, I'll take it, it's better for you
Somehow, we'll make it, 'cause that's what we do

Something out there, where love is your only friend, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better, and
Someone to spare when love is the only end, and
We are the ones that will make you feel better

We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better now3Embed
