Storm in a Teacup Lyrics
“Oh, good God in Heaven Almighty, Heavens to Murgatroyd
We've got a cataclysmic situation developing
Somebody get down here now!”

Come on, come on, baby
Let me show you what I'm talking about
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
You try to be a lady, but you're walking like a sauerkraut
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Looka— Looka like-a, like-a— Like you wanna get some
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
If you never tell a lie, then you never have to play dumb
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)

Dirty baby— Time, you're gonna take some
Pretty baby— Love, you're gonna make some
Little lady— Hearts, you're gonna break some
Kinda shady— Tears, you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby, gotta situation
Pretty baby, open invitation
Little lady, what a reputation
Kinda shady, now you're gonna make again
I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl

“Oh, God! Oh, no!
It's getting worse, worse by the minute
We're down here in division of mystery
Someone, send for back up right now!”

Every other day, you say you're gonna have to bury 'em
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Famous last words from the fuckin' Laserium
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
Descendents had a record sayin' somethin' bout Milo
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)
You can take the A-train, but you're gonna have to lie low
(Whoop-de-whoop-de-get-ta-gala-goop-ta!)

I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl (Yeah!)
I know you can battle the masses, dear
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl
Yeah! (Yeah)
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!


Dirty baby— Time, you're gonna take some
Pretty baby— Love, you're gonna make some
Little lady— Hearts, you're gonna break some
Kinda shady— Tears, you're gonna fake some
Dirty baby, gotta situation
Pretty baby, open invitation
Little lady, what a reputation
Kinda shady, now you're gonna make again

I know you can straddle the atmosphere
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl (Yeah!)
I know we may never get out of here
A tiny storm in your teacup, girl!3Embed
