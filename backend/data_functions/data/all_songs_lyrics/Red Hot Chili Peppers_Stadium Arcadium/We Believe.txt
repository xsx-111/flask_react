We Believe Lyrics
The curtain is open, a head to put dope in
Now we will come clean it
The future, we've seen it
No, no, I know— I said, no, no
It's like a dream that falls away
Into the night, where we can play
I'm on a train, one happy day
Two eyes for sight, three times I pray, hey

Soda pop, we've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes, we've got a pressure drop
We don't know, but every day I go
To see what I can bring into a cameo
(Ooh) Oh-oh! Oh, no! Bah-da-ra-de-ro-pom

We believe
We believe
We believe (Climb a tree for monkey business)
(Write a check-out to forgiveness)
We believe (All the world on half an acre)
(Pushing dirt into a quaker)
Oh!
The mission, the method
The downfall arrested
'Cuz it's not the first time, nor is it the worst time
No, no! Oh, no! Bah-da-ra-de-ro-pom (Uuh!)
To see the bird without a care
For in a word, it's nice out there
In a tree, my mama bear will be all right with proper care
(Hey) Hey, hey! Hey, oh! Bah-da-ra-de-ro-pom

Ha! Mh— Yeah
Uh— Whoa!

Boomerang into a bigger bang
A little cry of love, because they cannot sing
Cherokee, what did the pharaoh see?
Another time and space, another place to be

We believe, we believe
We believe, we believe
We believe (Climb a tree for monkey business)
(Write a check-out to forgiveness)
We believe (All the world on half an acre)
(Pushing dirt into a quaker)
We believe (Climb a tree for monkey business)
(Write a check-out to forgiveness)
We believe (All the world on half an acre)
(Pushing dirt into a quaker)
Yeah
The motive, the measure
The purpose, the pleasure
The risk, is it worth it?
The disc, is it perfect?
I found you amongst them
The flower with young stem
Disparage, the broken
The marriage, elopingEmbed
