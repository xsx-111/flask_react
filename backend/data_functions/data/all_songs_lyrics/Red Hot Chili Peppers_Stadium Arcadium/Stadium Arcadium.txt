Stadium Arcadium Lyrics
Bells around St. Petersburg when I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I findâ€”
Smoke surrounds your perfect face and I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space
And this where I find a way

The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon (Mirror to the moon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (Before and after noon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
Pushing myself and, no, I don't mind asking now

Alone inside my forest room and it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom, but this is where I start
(Derelict days, and the stereo plays for the all night crowd that it cannot phase)
And I'm calling
(Tedious weeds that the media breeds, but the animal gets what the animal needs)
And I'm sorry
The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon (Mirror to the moon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (Before and after noon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
Pushing myself and, no, I don't mind asking now


And this is where I find

Rays of dust that wrap around your citizen
Kind enough to disavow, and this is where I stand

The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon (Mirror to the moon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (Before and after noon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
Pushing myself and, no, I don't mind asking
The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon (Mirror to the moon)
Well, I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
State of the art until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (Before and after noon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming (Warming to you)
To you5Embed
