21st Century Lyrics
All the creatures on the beaches
Making waves in a motion picture
Won't you keep this in between us?
Search and seizure; wake up, Venus!
The dollar bill will mentally ill bill
Mom and dad, take your don't-be-sad pill
Turn the screw and twist my language
Don't forsake me, I'm contagious

There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
Come on (Ooh!)

It's my favorite combination
A—Coming down with the favored nations
Deep rotation, mutilation
A—Learn to give and take dictation

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Like Cain and Abel
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Uh, time to run this table
There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be

Read me your scripture now
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and I will twist it
Show me your wrist, and I—
Show me your wrist, and—
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it, kiss it

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Like Cain and Abel
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
It's time to run this table

Simple soldier, hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her
Strangulation, altercation
Oral sex and bird migration

There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be (C'mon!)
(Ah-aah) There's a reason for the 21st century
(Ah-aah) Not too sure, but I know that it's meant to be (Ah-aah)
And that it's meant to be (Ah-aah)
