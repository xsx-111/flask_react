If Lyrics
And if I had a clue, I'd know exactly what to do
If I were the wiser of the two
And if I saw it all so clear, I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two

We could take a walk into the canyons of 5th Avenue
Sing and dance, just to name a few

All I do
All I do

And if I heard the angels sing, I'd sing it back to you
And bring sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down, I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you

We could take a walk into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We could find a place to stay, a secret little hideaway
Spend a little time inside of you
All I do
All I do

All eyes
All eyes
All eyes on you (Eh, he-he-he-hey)

All I do (He-he-he-hey)
All I do
All I do (He-he-he-hey)
All I do1Embed
