Tell Me Baby Lyrics
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man, what did you have in mind?
“What have you come to do?”
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see, the lights are blue

Come and get it, lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, 'cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute

This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you

Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where do you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle Brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone

Chitty-chitty, baby, when your nose is in the nitty-gritty
Life could be a little sweet, but life could be a little shitty
What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City
Looking for a hundred, but you only ever found a fifty

Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home

Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind
(Behind!)

Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me, baby, what's your story?
Where you come from and where you wanna go this time? Oh
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Oh, giving up on the innocence you left behind10Embed
