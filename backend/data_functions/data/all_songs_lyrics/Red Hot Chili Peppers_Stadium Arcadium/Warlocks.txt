Warlocks Lyrics
Warlocks in wonderland
I've gotta megatropolis in my hand
And a subterranean marching band
Makin' noise for the boys in the Vatican
And a— A little package and off we go
Oh, ticky-ticky, tackita, tic-tac-toe
I know everybody's Eskimo
We've got another thing coming and that's our show, well

Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in

Lilacs and contraband
I've got Santa Monica in my hand
A little Beatlemania when I can
I've got two big bags of old Japan, oh
Ring side and blow-by-blow
Another main event at the old rainbow
We're comin' right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in

Make a deal with Uncle Weezer, sign your name to claim
Chi— China Chow will try to please her
Sweetness came from Jane


Warlocks in wonderland
I've gotta Rockapotomus in my hand
With a happy ending that's made of sand
With a little bit of lovin', is all I can

Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind to find your reason
Coming up on it everyday for—
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy that we believe in now2Embed
