Hey Lyrics
Won't somebody come along and teach me how to keep it alive to survive?
Come along and show me something that I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet

I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But, now I walk alone and talk about it when I know

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?


I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do

Let it on, I'll cut you off when you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway, I wanna let you know that everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?
You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But, now you're quick to get into your regret
I'll take the fall and now you got to give it all away

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?


I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do
I don't wanna have to, but I will, if that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill, but that's what I'm about to do

(Hey) Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stayed for a while, if I may (Oh)
Say it again and I'll come around, but not for the last time
(Hey) Hey, what would you say if I changed?
I'll change everything but my name (Oh)
Play it again and I'll come around, come around
But not for the last time, not for the last time

You used to be so warm and affectionate
I used to know just what I wanted and just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret
And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know

Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta get away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?11Embed
