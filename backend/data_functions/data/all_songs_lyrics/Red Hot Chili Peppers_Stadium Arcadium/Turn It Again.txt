Turn It Again Lyrics
Some of us get a little, and some a lot
We've got to make do with whatever we got
We get it hot, we cool it down, and then we pass it around
Oh, you can dance for the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid of whatever's in your way
Next stop, big hop, it's turning night into day
(Uh-uh) Sometimes, when I'm lying there all alone
(Uh-uh) I think of every little nothing that we could own
(Uh-uh) To overthrow all of you who have overgrown

All my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go, all we know, heavy load start to float
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(Uhâ€” Wow!)

I've come to learn whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into whatever light we bend
Out on the street, I get a beat and then I turn it to ten
(Uh-uh) Lace boots and the ladies of Kazakhstan
(Uh-uh) Kick them high to the sky, all of this just because we can
(Uh-uh) I turn to Cuba, then Aruba, then the Dominican
All my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go, all we know (Two things I wanna say now)
Heavy load start to float (You make it all okay now)
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(I need to know that you are there)

We've got to move it, if we want to do our best
We've got to shake it, if we want to keep it fresh
(Hah)

I'm turning down all the heavy psychology
To cut a rug and I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key and then I turn it for free
(Uh-uh) We've got to move it just a little to hit the spot
(Uh-uh) A whirling dervish in a flurry, a fox to trot
(Uh-uh) Come clown around, a robot (Uh-uh) doing the astronaut

All my friends like to spend days on end on the mend
I turn to you, I turn into and then I turn it again
Here we go, all we know (Two things I wanna say now)
Heavy load start to float (You make it all okay now)
Without a doubt, we turn it out and then we turn it again
(I need to know that you are there)
