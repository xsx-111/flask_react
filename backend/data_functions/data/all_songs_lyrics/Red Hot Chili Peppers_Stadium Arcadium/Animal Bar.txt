Animal Bar Lyrics
Never twenty-one when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I, I, I— The cry of isolation
I, I, I— The high of meditation
I, I, I— For sweet precipitation
I, I, I— The high of deprivation
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down, my station (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Let's break this!)
Runnin' through the mud, I gotta feeling of worth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Forsake this!)
All aboard the ship, 'cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down, you'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the pain and I'm a little older
Right as rain at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long

I, I, I— The cry of isolation
I, I, I— The high of meditation
I, I, I— For sweet precipitation
I, I, I— The high of deprivation
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long

Rain on my frustration (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down, my station (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Makes more rain forsaken (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Let's break this!)
Runnin' through the mud, I gotta feeling of worth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Forsake this!)
Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water, the water
The water saving us from the heat
Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
And fire will come find its day
The water, the water
The water washing it all away

Rain on my frustration (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down, my station (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Let's make this!)
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Forsake this!)
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Let's make this!)
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Forsake this!)
