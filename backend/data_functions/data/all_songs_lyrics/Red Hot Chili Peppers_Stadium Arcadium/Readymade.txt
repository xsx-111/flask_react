Readymade Lyrics
Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

I've got a cousin making beats deep down in Arizona
We're gonna rocket to Ramones in the city of Pomona
Go!

Readymade, readymade
Steady as the rhythm rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes

(Oh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it!
(Oh) And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it!

Readymade, readymade
Baby, ought celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate
I've got a sister making babies with a Black and Decker blow torch
We're gonna fop it all night in the middle of the back porch
Yeah!

Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate

(Oh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it!
(Oh) And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it!
(Oh, clean it up, Johnny!)



Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen, but don't be afraid
I've got a brother making trouble in the state of Caledonia
I wish I knew another way, but I'm gonna have to clone ya'
Hey!

Readymade, readymade
Rockin' for the sake of slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen, but don't be afraid

(Oh) And if I give to you my second sight
You got it!
(Oh) And if I stay the course, I'll stay the night
Come get it!3Embed
