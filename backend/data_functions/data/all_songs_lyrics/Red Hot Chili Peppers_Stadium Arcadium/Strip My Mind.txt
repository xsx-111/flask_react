Strip My Mind Lyrics
Whoa! Yeah-eh-yeah
Wow-wow, wow, wow, wow
Yeah!

Arthur J. did indicate it:
“The boulevard would never be so full of love and life again”
(Yeah) (Aw, say goodbye to your boots, man)
Hot as Hades, early eighties
Sing another song and make me feel like I'm in love again
(Yeah) (You gotta lose to win)

Oh, yeah!
Oh, please, don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please, don't strip my mind

Whoa! Yeah-eh-yeah
Wow-wow, wow, wow, wow
Yeah!

All in favor, sign a waiver
Bloody Carolina, won't you take another look inside?
(Yeah) (Aw, it will make you cry)
Operator, co-creator
Come on, radiator, won't you blow another top and sing?
(Yeah) (Ah, you only get what you dream)
Oh, yeah!
Oh, please, don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please, don't strip my mind
(Wow!)


El Dorado won the lotto, all that cash and not a clue
But now you know what I've been through
(Hey)

Oh, yeah!
Oh, please, don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please, don't strip my mind
Leave something behind3Embed
