100,000 Years  Lyrics
Sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
You mind if I sit down for a while
Reacquaint yourself with my style

Well, how could you have waited so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years

Sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone
All this time you put up a fear
For a hundred thousand years

And baby won't you let me
I think I'm going out of my head
I'm just about to, oh yeah, ow!

Alright! I got a question for you!
I got a question for everybody over here
I want to know, how many people over here
Like to party!
Well, alright!
And I got a question for all the wild people over here
Ah yeah!
I want to know how many people over here
Like to get high!
Alright
I got a question for everybody here
And I didn't forget about you people upstairs either
Ah yeah!
I want to know, how many people here tonight
Believe in rock 'n' roll!
Oh yeah!
Well, if you believe in rock 'n' roll...
Now, if you say you believe in rock 'n' roll...
I wanna hear everybody here say "rock 'n' roll!"
(Rock 'n' roll!)
Now come on, I know you can do better than that
So we're gonna try it again
I want y'all to catch your breath
'Cause here it comes:
I said rock 'n' roll!
(Rock 'n' roll!)
Oh, we're gettin' there, I know
I know if you really wanted to
You could bring the roof down! Yeah
Remember, say it this time like you mean it
Ready? Rock 'n' roll!
(Rock 'n' roll!)
Come on and clap your hands!
'Cause that's what rock 'n' roll is all about
Now, if y'all believe in rock 'n' roll...
Why don't you stand up for what you believe in?
Come on, get up! Whoo! Come on!
Do you feel right?
Do you feel right?
Do you feel right?
Do you feel alright? Ah yeah!
Come on
Well, come on
Come on!
Sorry to have taken so long
It must have been a bitch while I was gone!
You mind if I sit down for a while, would you, babe?
Reacquaint yourself with my style

Rock 'n' roll!Embed
