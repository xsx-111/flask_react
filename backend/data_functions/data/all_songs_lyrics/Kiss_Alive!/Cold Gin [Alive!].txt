Cold Gin  Lyrics
Alright, How y'all feel?
Alright, I got a little question for all you
I wanna know, how many people in here
Like to take a taste of alcohol?
Alright
I know you know it's getting so hot outside
You always need something to cool you off
There's gotta be some people out there
That like to drink tequila!
Alright!
I was talking to somebody backstage before
And they were telling me there's a lot of you people there
That like to drink vodka and orange juice
Yeah
I tell you something, when you're down in the dumps
And you need something to bring you up
There's only one thing that's gonna do it the way you want it
What's that?
(Cold gin!)
I can't hear you!
(Cold gin!)
Cold gin!
Alright!
Oh yeah!
Come on!
My heater's broke, I'm so tired
I need your fuel to build my fire
The girl next door, her lights are out, yeah
The landlord's gone, I'm down and out

Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
Cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together
It's time to leave and get another quart
Around the corner at the liquor store
The cheapest stuff is all I need
To get me back on my feet again

Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
Cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together
That keeps us together, yeah yeah
Alright! Ooh yeah!

Ooh, it's cold gin time again
You know it'll always win
Cold gin time again
You know it's the only thing
That keeps us together

Good night!Embed
