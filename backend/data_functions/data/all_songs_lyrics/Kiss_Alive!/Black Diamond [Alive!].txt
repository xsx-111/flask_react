Black Diamond  Lyrics
Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun (Ooh, ooh, ohh)
Got you under their thumb
Hit it!

Out on the street for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under their thumb

Whoo, black diamond!
Whoo, black diamond!
Darkness will fall on the city
It seems to follow you too (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Although you don't ask for pity
There's nothing that you can do

Whoo, black diamond!
Whoo, black diamond!
Aaah, yeah!

Out on the streets for a living
Picture's only begun
Your day is sorrow and madness
Got you under my thumb

Whoo, black diamond, yeah, yeah
Whoo, black diamond!

Good night!Embed
