Got to Choose  Lyrics
Lady
You know I heard the neighbors say
Baby
You might be leavin' me today
Oh yeah, mmm
Someone's come along and shared your time
Don't care, no I don't, no!
But you can't be his and still be mine
So

Ooh, got to choose
Who's your baby?
Ooh, got to choose
Sometimes, aw, sometimes
I know you need a change of pace
Oh yeah
But I ain't gonna run no race
Baby
You've got to tell me yes or no
Alright, alright, come on and tell me
Tell me if you're gonna go
Come on!
Ooh, got to choose
Who's your baby?
Ooh, got to choose
Who's your baby?

Who's your baby?
Who's your baby?
Who's your baby?
Who's your baby?

Ah yeah! Alright!
I'll tell y'all
I got this feeling tonight's
Gonna be one of those hot nights
Yeah!
We're gonna get this place hotter than Hell!1Embed
