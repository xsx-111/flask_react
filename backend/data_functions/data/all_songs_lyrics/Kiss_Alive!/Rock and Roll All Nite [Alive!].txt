Rock and Roll All Nite  Lyrics
Listen, I want to tell y'all
I want to tell you you've been a dynamite audience
And you deserve to give yourselves a round of applause
Let's go! Alright! Ah yeah
So let's rock and roll all night and party every day!

You show us everything you've got
You keep on dancin', and the room gets hot
And you drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
And you say you wanna go for a spin
The party's just begun, we'll let you in
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'
Come on!

I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
You keep on saying you'll be mine for a while
You're lookin' fancy, and I like your style
You drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy
And you show us everything you've got
Baby, baby, that's quite a lot
And you drive us wild, we'll drive you crazy

You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'
I can't hear ya!

I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day

You keep on shoutin', you keep on shoutin'
(What?)
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night
And party every dayEmbed
