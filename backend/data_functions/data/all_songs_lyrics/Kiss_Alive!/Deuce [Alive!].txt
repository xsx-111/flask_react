Deuce  Lyrics
You wanted the best, and you got it!
The hottest band in the land: Kiss!

Get up!
And get your grandma out of here
Pick up!
Old Jim is working hard this year
Baby!
Do the things he says to do
(Do it!)

Baby, if you're feeling good
Baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
He's worth a deuce
Honey!
Don't put your man behind his years
And baby!
Stop crying all your tears
Baby!
Do the things he says to do
(Do it!)
Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard
He's worth a deuce

Baby, if you're feeling good
And baby, if you're feeling nice
You know your man is working hard

Yeah! How you doing?, Ah yeah
It looks like we're gonna have ourselves
A rock and roll party tonight!1Embed
