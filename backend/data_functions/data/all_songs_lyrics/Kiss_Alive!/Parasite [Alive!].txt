Parasite  Lyrics
She'll always be there trying to grab a hold
She thought she knew me, but she didn't know
That I was sad and wanted her to go, oh

Parasite lady
Parasite eyes
Parasite lady
No need to cry
I didn't really wanna have to get away
I told her things I didn't wanna say
I need her, and I hope she'll understand, yeah

Parasite lady
Parasite eyes
Parasite lady
No need to cry

Parasite lady
Parasite eyes
Parasite lady
No need to cry1Embed
