The Pecan Tree LyricsDrooling red from my eyes
To meet the bitter sun
That shines past into light
That shines past into light
Setting fire to curtains
In hope that you're dreaming
Destroying the tomb
Of memories from your life
Destroying the tomb
Of memories from your life
In the room full of family
But couldnâ€™t find one, but couldn't find one
In the hallways lit up brightly but couldn't find myself
I laid drunk on the concrete on the day of your birth in celebration of all you were worth
I am my father's son
I am no one
I cannot love
It's in my blood
I am my father's son
I am no one
I cannot love
It's in my blood
I am my father's son
I am no one
I cannot love
It's in my blood
It's in my blood3Embed
