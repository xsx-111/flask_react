Punk Rock / Cody LyricsOf all I knew
Her held too few
And would you stop me
If I try to stop you?
Old songs stay 'til the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way it is
I could leave it all
And I ask myself
Would you care at all?
When I drive alone at night
I see the streetlights as fairgrounds
And I tried a hundred times
To see the road signs as Day-Glo
Old songs stay 'til the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way it is
I could leave it all
And I ask myself
Would you care at all?
Would you care at all?
Would you?
Old songs stay 'til the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way it is
I could leave it all
And I ask myself
Would you care at all?
Would you?
Would you?Embed
