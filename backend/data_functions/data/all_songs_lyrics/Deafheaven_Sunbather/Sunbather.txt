Sunbather LyricsI held my breath and drove through a maze of wealthy homes
And I watched how green the trees were
And I watched how green the trees were
And I watched the steep walkways and the white fences
I gripped the wheel
I gripped the wheel
I gripped the wheel
I gripped the wheel
I sweated against the leather
I sweated against the leather
I watched the dogs twist through the wealthy garden
I watched the dogs twist through the wealthy garden
I watched the dogs
I watched you lay on a towel in grass that exceeded the height of your legs
I gazed into reflective eyes
I cried against an ocean of light
An ocean of light
An ocean of light
Crippled by the cushion, I sank into sheets
Frozen by rose petal toes
My back shivered for your pressed granite nails
Dishonest and ugly through the space in my teeth
Break bones down to yellow and crush gums into blood
The hardest part for the weak
Was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth
The hardest part for the weak
Was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth
Was stroking your fingers with rings full of teeth
It's 5 AM and my heart flourishes at each passing moment
Always and forever, always and forever
It's 5 AM and my heart flourishes at each passing moment
Always and forever, always and forever
Always and forever
Always and forever11Embed
