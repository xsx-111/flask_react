Dream House Lyrics
Hindered by sober restlessness
Submitting to the amber crutch
The theme in my aching prose
The theme in my aching prose
Fantasizing the sight of Manhattan
Fantasizing the sight of Manhattan
Manhattan
That pour of a bitter red being
That escapes a thin frame
A bitter red being
The rebirth of mutual love
The rebirth of mutual love
The slipping on gloves to lay
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
The slipping on gloves to lay
The slipping on gloves to lay tenderly
The slipping on gloves to lay
Slipping on gloves
Gloves, gloves
Slipping on gloves


"I'm dying."
- "Is it blissful?"
"It's like a dream."
- "I want to dream."
"I'm dying."
- "Is it blissful?"
"It's like a dream."
- "I want to dream."
- "I want to dream."
- "I want to dream."
- "I want to dream."
