To the Edge Lyrics
Here I start to define it
As a sign on my skin that I just try to wash away
Reminder
Infected, it'll be painful to me

Life is so short
Close to the edge of another back door
Life is so sure
Life will be ready to twist up your world

Here it starts to enlighten
There's a frame I can't change that I just have to watch again
Reminder
Repressed inside me, it keeps repeating

Life is so short
Close to the edge of another back door
Life is so sure
Life will be ready to twist up your world

(Oh... whoa... oh... oh, oh)
(Oh... whoa... oh...)
(Close to the edge)
Life is so short
Close to the edge of another back door
Life is so sure
Life will be ready to twist up your world
