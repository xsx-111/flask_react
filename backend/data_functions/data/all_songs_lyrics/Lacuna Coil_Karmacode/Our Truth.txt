Our Truth Lyrics
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh

Clock is ticking while I'm killing time
Spinning all around
Nothing else that you can do to turn it back
Wicked partnership in this crime
Ripping off the best
Condescending smile

Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth
...
Go on, tease me

Clock is ticking while I'm stealing time
Can't you turn it back?
Stop the cycle, set it free and run away
Silent sneaking along my path
Rugged the road but we
Feel it like we're flyin'
(Feel it like we're flyin'...)
Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth


Trying to forget (wasting my time)
We're falling right through
Lying to forget (telling more lies)
We're raising our truth...

Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa oh-oh-oh-oh-oh2Embed
