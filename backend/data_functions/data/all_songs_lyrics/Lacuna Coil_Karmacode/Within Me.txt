Within Me Lyrics
Something about you, that makes me feel bad
I wasn't there when a thin line destroyed your soul

I search every corner, there's nowhere to hide how I feel
Ignorance, sacrifice...
Some days it's harder, let's face it, it's all about me
Deeply into your own

Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night
Gone and I know there will be
Another way
I'm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye

Something about you will make me stronger
Now I'm aware when a man falls, rebound, my fault

I search every corner, there's nowhere to hide how I feel
Ignorance, sacrifice
Some days it's harder, let's face it, it's all about me
Deeply into your own
Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night
Gone and I know there will be
Another way
I'm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye, goodbye...


Here I wanna be, no more lies (here I wanna be, no more lies)
Here I wanna be
Here I wanna be, no more lies
(Here I wanna be, no more lies)
Here I wanna be...


Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night
Gone and I know there will be
Another way
I'm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye, goodbye...
Deep within me
Life's crawling and wasting my days
Another night
Gone and I know there will be
Another way
I'm leading myself to be free
In this eternal goodbye...Embed
