Fragments of Faith Lyrics
It's not the way to cross the faith
The promise has been broken
My disease, everlasting
Let me bleed forever
Have to wait
Come and get me
Lost in here, I'm nothing
Tie my hands
Let me feel alive one more time

Where is the pain?
Somewhere... down

Can you feel it? (ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah)
Don't you know there is no more time? (a-ah...)
Can you feel it? (ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah)
Don't you know there is no more time? (ah...)

My halo fades
Sin is calling
The promise has been stolen
My disease, everlasting
Let me dream forever
Soul to take
Come and get it
Lost in here, I'm nothing
Tie my hands
Let me feel alive one more time
Where is the pain?
Somewhere... down

Can you feel it? (ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah)
Don't you know there is no more time? (a-ah...)
Can you feel it? (ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah)
Don't you know there is no more time? (ah...)

Can you feel it? (ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah)
Don't you know there is no more time? (ah-ah... ah...)
Can you feel it? (ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah)
Don't you know there is no more time? (ah-ah...)

Can you feel it..? (Never let it go...)
(No more time... can you feel it...?)
No more time... (Oh...)
Can you feel it...? (Never let it go...)
(No more time... can you feel it...?)
No more time...
(Oh...)
Never let it go
Can you feel it? (ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah)
Don't you know there is no more time? (a-ah...)
Can you feel it? (ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah-ah ah)
Don't you know there is no more time? (a-ah...)1Embed
