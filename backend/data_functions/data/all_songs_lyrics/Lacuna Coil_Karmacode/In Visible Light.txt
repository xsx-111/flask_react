In Visible Light Lyrics
How can time still drain
Every little beat of my heart?
In my time of need
I want to destroy anything you are...

Grief is the light... (grief is the light)
I can't deny I'm afraid of you
Grief is the light... (grief is the light)
I'm not afraid to deny...

What have you ever denied?
'Cause you're just the one that had it all
While I'm just the dice in your hands
And no, it's not easy...

Grief is the light... (grief is the light)
I can't deny I'm afraid of you
Grief is the light... (grief is the light)
I'm not afraid to deny...

Will I suffer in vain?
You're feeding all my fears
I cannot escape
You're here in my head

Grief is the light... (grief is the light)
I can't deny I'm afraid of you
Grief is the light... (grief is the light)
I'm not afraid to deny...Embed
