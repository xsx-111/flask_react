The Game Lyrics
Will I just tell you to give up
No matter how you'll play this game?
But I can handle the sorrow
Whatever, time is running out...
(Whoa, oh, oh... whoa, oh, oh...)
(Oh, what am I gonna do?)

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relievin' my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind
I, I, I...

Will I be such of a dreamer?
No matter how I play this game
To get is symptom of giving
Whatever, time is over now...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, oh-oh, ah)
(What am I gonna do?)

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relievin' my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind
I, I, I...

You wonder why
Our last goodbye
It's relievin' my tears, it's so easy
I won't deny
Life changed my mind
I, I, I...Embed
