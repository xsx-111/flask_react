Devoted Lyrics
I'll be there
When there's nothing left
Night and day
Holding you
Harmony
Deep inside your soul
Meet me there

Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me
Deep inside?

There's no time
To deny that I'll need you
And I'll be there
To inhale your delightful day
There's no time
To deny I will need you
That's why I'll be there
To relieve your painful day

Hiding well
Where the pain is real
Night and day
Grow'n' in you
Anger is
Poison in your veins
Meet me there
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me
Deep inside?

There's no time
To deny that I'll need you
And I'll be there
To inhale your delightful day
There's no time
To deny I will need you
That's why I'll be there
To relieve your painful day


Deep inside
There's no time
To deny that I'll need you
And I'll be there
To inhale your delightful day
There's no time
To deny I will need you
That's why I'll be there
To relieve your painful day (day...)Embed
