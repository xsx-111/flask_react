Without a Reason Lyrics
Will you wash my feet again
With the tears I've cried out?
Will you save me from my selfishness?

Feels like talking to a wall
In this universe I'm lost
As I keep on searching
On and on without a reason

Here I come to show you...
Our path, it is your heart...
I'm melting in, to you...
Our destiny, so cruel...

In the journey of my existence, I felt
Strong in my beliefs
Could I find a better way to
This reality (ooh-ooh-ooh ooh ooh)

Feels like talking to a wall
In this universe I'm lost
As I keep on searching
On and on without a reason
Here I come, to show you...
Our path, it is your heart...
I'm melting in, to you...
Our destiny, so cruel

Feels like talking to a wall
(Whoa oh oh oh oh...)
Feels like talking to a wall


I'm melting in, to you...
Our destiny, so cruel...

(Whoa oh ee-ee yeah...)
Feels like talking to a wall
(Whoa oh ee-ee yeah...)
Feels like talking to a wall
(Whoa oh ee-ee yeah...)
Feels like talking to a wall
(Whoa oh ee-ee yeah...)
Feels like talking to a wallEmbed
