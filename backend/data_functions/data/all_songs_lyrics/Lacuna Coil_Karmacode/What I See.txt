What I See Lyrics
Oh oh oh... oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh oh oh... oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

Hear what I say
I'm gonna get outta my mind
Where I'm going to
Be on your way
Your spirit is calling after
Will I disappear?

Everything dies, nothing to worr' about
Everything goes on, goes on, goes on

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape
There's nothing more I can do
I just don't know, why do I need you?

See what I see
I'm going to get outta my mind
Where I'm going to
(No more, no more)
I'm ready to go
Serene to find
There's nothing to hold to reach you...
Everything dies, nothing to worr' about
Everything goes on, goes on, goes on

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape
There's nothing more I can do
I just don't know, why do I need you?

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape
There's nothing more I can do
I just don't know, why do I need you?

(Oh oh oh... oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
(Oh oh oh... oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)
(Oh oh oh... oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh)

I just don't know why everything has to go away
I just don't know why everything has to fade away
I cannot escape
There's nothing more I can do
I just don't know, why do I need you...?Embed
