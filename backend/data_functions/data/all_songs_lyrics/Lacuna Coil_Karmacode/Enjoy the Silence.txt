Enjoy the Silence Lyrics
Words like vi'lence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl

All I wanted
All I needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I wanted
All I needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I wanted
All I needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

(Oh...oh-oh...ee-oh...)
Enjoy the silence
(Ooh-ooh ah-ee-ah...)
(Ah-ah...ee-ah...)
Enjoy the silence
(Ooh-ooh ah-ee-ah...)
(Ah-ah...ee-ah...)
Enjoy the silence
(Ooh-ooh ah-ee-ah...)
(Ah-ah...ee-ah...)
Enjoy the silence
(Ooh-ooh ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah-ee-ah...)
(Ah-ah-ah...)
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh...)Embed
