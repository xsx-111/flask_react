Fragile Lyrics
(Hey-ah ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-a-ah, ah-a-ah, ah-a-ah)
(Hey-ah... hey-ah, hey-ah hey-ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
(Hey ah-ah ah-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah, oh oh oh)
(Hey oh, hey oh...)

What? Damn, you're right!
Dare is about obsession
It's something inside
Wounds are bleeding in my hands
Turning blind
No one will ever stop this self-made decline
Nothing really matters...

He's watching me
What if I look away and deal with it?
He's watching me
Digging in my grave
He's watching me
I won't deny
Fragile my crystal ball
He's watching me
Shattered on the ground
What? Damn, you're right!
Learn is about rejection
There's nothing to hide
Wounds are healing in my hands
Turning blind
No one will ever scratch
My own state of mind
Nothing really matters...

He's watching me
What if I look away and deal with it?
He's watching me
Digging in my grave
He's watching me
I won't deny
Fragile my crystal ball
He's watching me
Shattered on the ground...

Ya-he-ah...
Ya-he-ah, ya-he-ah...
Ya-he-ah, ya-he-ah...
Hey ah-ah ah-ah-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah
Hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah, hey-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Hey-oh oh-oh-oh, hey-ah hey-ah hey-ah
Hey-ah-ah, hey-ah hey-ah...
He's watching me
What if I look away and deal with it?
He's watching me
Digging in my grave
He's watching me
I won't deny
Fragile my crystal ball
He's watching me
Shattered on the ground...
