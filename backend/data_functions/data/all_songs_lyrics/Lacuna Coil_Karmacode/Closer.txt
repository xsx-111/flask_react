Closer Lyrics
Want to get closer in too deep
Where there is something I wish for I'll go through
Want to get closer into you
No hell to discover
I've got it all inside myself
Salvation you have preached is gone
No way you can't turn it around

Looking for a higher ground (higher)
Searching for this something missed before (searching for more)
From a higher ground (higher)
Will I fall in a right direction? (searching for...)

Falling apart, there's nothing real
That will convince me to change but I'll go through
Want to get closer into you
No hell to discover
There is just nothing to betray
Salvation you have preached is gone
No way you can turn it around

Looking for a higher ground (higher)
Searching for this something missed before (searching for more)
From a higher ground (higher)
Will I fall in a right direction? (searching for...)
Looking for a higher ground (higher)
Searching for this something missed before (searching for more)
From a higher ground (higher)
Will I fall in a right direction? (searching for...)

Looking for a higher ground (higher)
Searching for this something missed before (searching for more)
From a higher ground (higher)
Will I fall in a right direction? (searching for...)

Looking for a higher ground (higher)
Searching for this something missed before (searching for more)
From a higher ground (higher)
Will I fall down into your arms? (searching for...)Embed
