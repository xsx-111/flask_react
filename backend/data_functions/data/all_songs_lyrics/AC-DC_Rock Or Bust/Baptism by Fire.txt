Baptism by Fire Lyrics
Let’s get the party started
And, lady, do your tricks
Let’s get the joint a-jumping
The boys need their kicks
(Ha ha ha ha)
We’re gonna shock the nation
And make ‘em flip their lids
You know you need a vacation
Ooh, bring along a bottle and enjoy the trip

I said, ride, ride, ride
Up all night
Ride
It’ll blow your mind

Baptism by fire
Go with them rolling tires
Baptism by fire
You snap a burning wire

Play your hand
Come on, and make a stand, hey
You hear her clap of thunder
Or feel her lightning spike
You get your pistons firing
It’s Lady Fortune’s night

Ride, ride, ride
Up all night
Ride
It’ll blow your mind

Baptism by fire
Now with them rollin' tires
Baptism by fire
You feel the burnin' wire
Baptism by fire
Shooting high and shooting higher, yeah

Play your hand
Come on, and play your hand
And let me show you how, yeah
Come on, and make a stand

It’ll blow your mind

Baptism by fire
Sweet, sweet desire
Baptism by fire
You got the burnin' wire
Baptism by fire
Shooting high and shooting higher
Yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
