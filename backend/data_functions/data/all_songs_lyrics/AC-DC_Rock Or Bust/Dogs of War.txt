Dogs of War Lyrics
Dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Dogs of war

You be a fightin' man
Make all the cash you can
Don't make civilian ties
They lie to rest, their lives
Takin' all you can
Risk ain't in the plan
Feel the boots upon the ground
Trouble brewing all around

Dodging the bullets
Shooting the missiles
Soldiers of fortune
Such a pretty name
Face the game
Mercenary man
We be the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
We be the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)

I'll fight, fight in the night
Run away or die of fright
Keep in time, keep in line
Where there's smoke, there's fire

Dodging the bullets
Shooting the missiles
Soldiers of fortune
Such a pretty name
Face the game
You mercenary man

We be the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
We'll be the dogs of war
(Dogs of war)
Call in the dogs of war
Send in the dogs of war

We be the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
We'd be the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Call in the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)
Send in the dogs of war
(Soldier of fortune)

Marchin' through the madness
Those mercenary men
(Dogs of war)
(Dogs of war)
(Dogs of war)3Embed
