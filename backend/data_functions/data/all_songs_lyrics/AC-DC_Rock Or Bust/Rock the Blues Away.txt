Rock the Blues Away Lyrics
Driving in my car
We're headin' for the local bar
Pickin' up my girl tonight
Everythin' a-gon' be alright
Shootin' pool with my friends
Smokin' cigarettes
Tellin' jokes out loud
Laughin' with the crowd

And we rock it (and we rock it)
And we roll it (and we roll it)
And we're laughing (and we're laughing)
And we're joking (and we're joking)
And we roll it
Baby, we rock it and roll it
We won't get the blues
Because

We rock the blues an' play
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day
And when I'm on my way back home
I listen to the radio
I hear some great rock sounds
That make you want to sing out loud

And we rock it (and we rock it)
And we roll it (and we roll it)
And we're laughing (and we're laughing)
And we're joking (and we're joking)
And we roll it
Baby, we rock it and roll it
We won't get the blues
Because

We rock the blues an' play
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day


Rock the blues an' play
Up all night and day
Drink the night away
Until the light of day-ay-ay
(Rock the blues an' play)
Up all night and day
(Drink the night away)
Till the light of day-ay-ayEmbed
