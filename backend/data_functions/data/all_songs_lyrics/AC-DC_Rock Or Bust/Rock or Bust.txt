Rock or Bust Lyrics
Hey ya here
Are you ready?

We be a guitar band
We play across the land
Shootin' out tonight
Gonna keep you up alright
You hear the guitar sound
Playin' nice and loud
Rock you to your knees
Gonna make your destiny

In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust

We hear the siren scream
It sounds so lean and mean
We love to shake it down
Know what we're talkin' bout?
We turn the amps up high
The crowd's gonna hit the sky
We play it fast and loose
Because this night we're gonna pull the fuse
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust

May be up to no good

In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock we trust, it's rock or bust
In rock n' roll we trust, it's rock or bust10Embed
