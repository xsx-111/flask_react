Emission Control Lyrics
It is my mission
To seek you out
You up for grabs, honey
Breathe in, don't make a sound

(Gettin' it up)
Get high off the ground
(Givin' it up)
Not fooling around
(Raising it up)
You can't be here and be shy
(Raising it up)
Systems to the sky

Call in emission control
Emission control
Call in emission control
Emission control
It's good for the soul, yeah

Turn on emission
The engine comes alive
She takes to pairing, mama
Like a lion ready to strike
Ready to strike
(Hold it up)
Take full flight and fly
(Hold it up)
You got to raise it on high
(Raising it up)
You can't be here and be shy
(Raising it up)
Systems to the sky
(Givin' it up)

(Givin' it up)

Call in emission control
Emission control
Call in emission control
Emission control
It's good for the soul, yeah
Giving it up
Giving it up
Raising it up
Giving it up
Giving it up
Raising it up1Embed
