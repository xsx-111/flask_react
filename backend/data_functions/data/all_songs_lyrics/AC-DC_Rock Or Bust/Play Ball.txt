Play Ball Lyrics
Listen
Hit me up, fill my cup
Pour me another round
Come on in, mix in the sin
Come in and join the crowd
I said
It's party time when I'm on the loose
Make ya feel alright
(Listen) Drinks all around, I'm in the mood
Because the night is mine

Let's play ball
Shootin' down the walls
Let's play ball, babe
Battin' down the stalls
Play, play, play ball

Listen said
Light me up, I'm in luck
I'm off the leash and unbound
Dive on in and swim in the gin
Come on, shout it out loud
Let's play ball
Shooting down the walls, yeah
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stalls, yeah
Play, play, play ball

Hit that thing outta here
Hey, yeah
It's a home run

Let's play ball
Shooting down the walls
Let's play ball
Battin' down the stalls
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Let's play ball
Play, play, play ball3Embed
