Got Some Rock & Roll Thunder Lyrics
Well, I'm heading on out
Down to a major town
I'm getting hungry
I'm getting mean
I'm getting down on easy street

Bad luck
I get by

I'm feeling tough
I'm getting wild

I'm in town
Ready to go
I'll be around
And then I'll let you know

I got some rock and roll thunder
Some rock and roll thunder
Yes
Hey, hey, hey

I been working
Need bankroll
I get high on rock and roll
I get the beat, babe, on easy street
I don't need a handgun
I got it made

Down on your luck?
I'll get you a round

I'm here to help you
Show you what I found

Tailor made for ya
The party is in town
I'm tailor made for you
Come see what I have found

I got some rock and roll thunder
I got some rock and roll thunder
Hey, hey, what do you know?
I said, feeling great and ready to roll
I got the rock and roll thunder
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey


I got some rock and roll thunder
Got rock and roll thunder
Hey, hey what do you know?
I said, feeling great and a-ready to roll
I got the rock and roll thunder
The rock and roll thunder
I said, my rock and roll thunder
Rock and roll thunder1Embed
