Rock the House Lyrics
Mistress, mistress all night long
Keep on coming, hard and strong

Hot to the touch
Hot to the taste
Who's it now, on my plate?
I'm gonna yell out
She's gonna shout
She gonna push it all the way down
Gonna kick up her heels
Make you scream
Back on out, baby
Make you scream

Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll

Hold on tight, she plays a tease
Squeeze you around she aim to please
She's gonna kick her legs high in the air
She's gonna shake it down
A hot, wet, wild affair
Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll


Look in my eyes, what do I see?
A hot blooded woman just a-waiting for me
Gonna kick up her heels
Make you scream
Back on out, baby
Make you squeal

Rock the house
Rock the house
Rock this house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll
Rock the house
Rock, rock, rock and let it roll
Let it roll
Rock the house down
'Till the walls come down1Embed
