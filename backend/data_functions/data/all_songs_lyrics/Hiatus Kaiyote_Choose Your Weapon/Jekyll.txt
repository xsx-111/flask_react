Jekyll LyricsDr. Jekyll that mister been buggin out my Hyde again
If he come in rapping on my door I’m not gonna answer it
I’ve been grieving old fashioned at the seed, my seam is fraying
I’ve been grieving old fashioned at the seed, my seam is fraying
Silk once rushed this thrust has rusted dry
Slip your flux right past your fortress
We all are born to die
We all are born to die
Lease this here now sweet piece of mind awake this light
Lease this here now sweet peace of mind
Always in flight6Embed
