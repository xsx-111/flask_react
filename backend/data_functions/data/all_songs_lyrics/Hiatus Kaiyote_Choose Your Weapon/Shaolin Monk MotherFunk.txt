Shaolin Monk MotherFunk Lyrics
Follow my love, follow my love

Drop into, drop into
Drop into this or I’ll be swinging it solo
Drop into this, drop into this
Drop into this or I'll be swinging it solo

The lines on your palm cry out to be cloaked
With the steady compass of my own
My constellations burn to be strung to yours
Almighty dot to dot

So drop into this, so drop into this
So drop into this or I’ll be swinging it solo
So drop into this, honey help me swim right through this
So drop into this or I'll be swinging it solo

In this heat don’t doubt, I own the hour
White ocher shower
Howling as it falls to find the form
Of dust once more
In this heat don’t doubt, I own the hour
White ochre shower
Howling as it falls to find the form
Of dust once more
In this heat don’t doubt, I own the hour
White ochre shower
Howling as it falls to find the form
Of dust once more
As time fleets, don’t tire, your hands in mine
As time fleets, don’t tire, your hands in mine
As time fleets, don’t tire, your hands in mine
As time fleets, don’t tire, your hands in mine

So drop into this, so drop into this
So drop into this or I’ll be swinging it solo
So drop into this, honey help me swim right through this
So drop into this or I'll be swinging it solo9Embed
