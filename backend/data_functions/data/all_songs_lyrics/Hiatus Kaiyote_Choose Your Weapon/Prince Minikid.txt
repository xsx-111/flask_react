Prince Minikid LyricsDiamond of a boy
Docile and wide eyed
And small in size
Stay warm
Tranquil a hymn of vermillion
Prince minikid i feed you water and seed from my lips
Sleeps through the day
Drunk on the fruit of symmetry
Sleep in my hair, a nest, your labyrinth
Lapse of myth
I found a babe to keep warm and safe
I found a babe to keep warm and safe2Embed
