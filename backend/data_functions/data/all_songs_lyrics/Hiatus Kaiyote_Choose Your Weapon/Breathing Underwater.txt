Breathing Underwater Lyrics
The word hurts, the word hurts
The word hurts, the word hurts
In water, in water
In water, in water
The word hurts, the word hurts
The word hurts, the word hurts
In water, in water
In water, in water
In water, in water
In water, in water

Material, slowly unwind as I leave feathers behind
For your love, for your lover to find
Warm hands wrapped in blue linen from Tuareg sands
For your love, for your lover to find
Wild rose, Jericho sun, arid as stone
For your love, for your lover to find
Aorta, tattoo the artery with acute artistry
For your love, for your lover to find

Breathing, breathing underwater
Breathing, breathing underwater, ah
Bre-brea-breath you underwater
Pleasure, melting a snowflake of lace down your face
For your love, for your lover to find
I could call your demons inside, soak them in Camomile
For your love, for your lover to find

Breathing, breathing underwater
Breathing, breathing underwater
I could bre-brea-breath you underwater

To find
For your love, for your lover to find
For your love, for your lover to find
For your love, for your lover to find
For your love, for your lover to find
Bre-breathing underwater
Breathing underwater
Breathing underwater
Breathing underwater
For your love, for your lover, your love, for your love
For your love, for your lover, your love, for your love
For your love, for your lover, your love, for your love
For your love, for your lover, your love, for your love
For your love, for your lover
For your love, for your lover
For your love, for your lover
For your love, for your lover
I want you to breathe it in, I want you to breathe it in
I want you to breathe it in, I want you to breathe it in
The word hurts, the word hurts
The word hurts, the word hurts
In water, in water
In water, in water
The word hurts, the word hurts
The word hurts, the word hurts
In water, in water
In water, in water9Embed
