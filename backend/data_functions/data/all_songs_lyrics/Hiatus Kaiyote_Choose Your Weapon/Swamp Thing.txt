Swamp Thing Lyrics
Aftermath of the catch
Reeling in the secrets of the swamp
A motorcade harrowed and dapper underneath the surface
Founded, its talons curl they come to get you boy
Howling like...

A toothless grinned swamp thing
Is lurking, come get you
Is lusting for your skin
Its hunger is climbing

A will-'O-wisp, a rum soaked ritual
Ravenous its cold stare is habitual
Send a message with fire smouldering across the lily pad
Saffron tears the sweetest youâ€™ve ever had

A toothless grinned swamp thing
Is lurking come get you
Come close dear, I could hold you
Safe in the water where the pressure
Crush you like pestle and mortar
Kiss your fever sleep forever
Forever
To sleep, to sleep
