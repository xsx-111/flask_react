Building a Ladder Lyrics
Free range of the mind
Maps the fire coasting the sidelines
Contact with an ease
Tarnish point of the supreme
Is it the strength of your fearless over throwing your pain
You’ll see new heights you’ll be reaching
Is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake ripples your sweet fate
Free range of the mind
Maps the fire coasting the sidelines
Contact with an ease
Tarnish point of the supreme
Is it the strength of your feelings over throwing your pain
You’ll see new heights you’ll be reaching
Is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake ripples your sweet fate

In the death of the grip of the mask
That’s covering your simple love for the part
Of your soul so warm and vast
And I can hear the hinges struggle to last rusting
Feel my feathers rush from the past

Building a ladder of love to you
And I hope that love you build one too
Building a ladder of love to you
And I hope that love you build one too
And then we fly away
Building a ladder of love to you
And I hope that love you build one too
Building a ladder of love to you
And I hope that love you build one too
And then we fly away
Hand in hand we fly away
Hand in hand5Embed
