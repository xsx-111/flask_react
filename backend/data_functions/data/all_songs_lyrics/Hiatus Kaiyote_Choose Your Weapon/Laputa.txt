Laputa Lyrics
Graphite to paper
A saga-born, hand-drawn artisan dreamer
Graphite to paper
A saga-born and hand-drawn artisan dreamer
Miyazaki frontier
A crystal-clear picture of aluminum seeker
This view from here is airborne
Mystic catacomb creeper
Who whispers stone cold
And as the mind funnels deeper
A relic, a teacher
A talisman in the hand
Navigate to seek up above

Laputa (Miss you)
Laputa (How I miss you)
Laputa (How I miss you)
Floating castle in the sky (miss you)
Laputa (How I miss you)
Floating castle in the sky
Laputa
Young one hear this
Feel this
I've been running, running, but the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
I've been running, running, but the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
I've been running, running, but the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
I've been running, running, but the riot hunts for you, you, you, you
Give me the timeless corridors of your meadows, of your meadows
Give me the timeless corridors of your meadows, of your meadows
Give me the timeless corridors of your meadows, of your meadows
Give me the timeless corridors of your meadow, of your meadows
Laputa
