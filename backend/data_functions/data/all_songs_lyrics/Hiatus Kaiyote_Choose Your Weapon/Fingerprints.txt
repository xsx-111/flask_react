Fingerprints Lyrics
Broken memories
They taunt me like a bird caged by scorched wings
Puzzle pieces missing
All the grubby fingerprints that kissed the walls have vanished

Like the wind without her whisperings
And the colours wept from all her tapestries
Would be left nothing but sullen imagery
The uncertainty of forgotten things

Broken memories
They taunt me like a bird caged by scorched wings
Puzzle pieces missing
All the grubby fingerprints that kissed the walls have vanished

The phoenix she dies with her wings burning
She sinks from the sky to the earth returning
But she will rise through ashes singing
With new wisdom she flies
With new wisdom she flies
With wisdom she flies to a new beginning4Embed
