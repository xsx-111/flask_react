Borderline With My Atoms Lyrics
Melt into the other world
Melt, melt
He saw my eyes turn gold and reptile
I'll dream tonight, bare and baptized
Bare and baptized
Coyote bones flex the muscle of animal spirit old
A bond so simple

Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline, in time, it all collides

After the coal has settled deep beneath ash resting
Quiet as silk the remedy tempers the willing
A ripe submergence of the highest order, no borders
After the coal has settled deep beneath ash resting
Quiet as silk the remedy tempers the willing
A ripe submergence of the highest order, no borders

Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline with my, my atoms
Borderline, in time, it all collides6Embed
