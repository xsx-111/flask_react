By Fire Lyrics
Direct to the old Navajo by the fire
Wish we were burn your design
Suede and hawk feather entwine me to the time
Arizona in June light
A bell that rings in the chest of story told
Meet you in this future bold
Sage at key point lead me to his funeral
A man lost young and old

Regret less the knot yes I give you the end to hold
Through darkness and earth wet I seek through the land to mould
A woman that rests night and day, sweat and tears unfold
To undress the burden that caress the blessed I’m told
Regret less the knot yes I give you the end to hold
Through darkness and earth wet I seek through the land to mould
A woman that rests night and day, sweat and tears unfold
To undress the burden that caress the blessed I’m told8Embed
