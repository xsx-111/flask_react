The Lung Lyrics
Cool it out by Coolabah
Cool it out by Coolabah
Overrun from the mouth

Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down

Fill the lung that loves the phosphorescent absorbent time spent on few
And all of you, i'll offer myrrh and murder the preferred method of doubt that sways about
Heavy and unsound
I offer this smoke from you
Overrun from the mouth
You
The truth overrun from the mouth

Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Stone a flare cold undercoat bare
An apple over head
Swift courage shoot it down
Cool it out by Coolabah
Quick, quick to
Quick to lose, quick to lose your
Quick to lose your furrowed brow brow7Embed
