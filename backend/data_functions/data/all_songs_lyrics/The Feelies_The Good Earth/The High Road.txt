The High Road Lyrics
Take a ride
Take a ride and keep on going
Look around
Look around and just keep going
The white lines
The white lines the side of the road
They go on
They go on right to your home

See the signs
See the signs upon your way
On the ground
On the ground is where you'll stay
It's gonna rise
Gonna rise and carry us home
Gonna rise
Gonna rise and carry us home tonight

Now it's time
Now it's time to let 'er go
That's right
Let 'em know just where they're going
It's gonna rise
Gonna rise and carry us home
Gonna rise
Gonna rise and carry us home tonightEmbed
