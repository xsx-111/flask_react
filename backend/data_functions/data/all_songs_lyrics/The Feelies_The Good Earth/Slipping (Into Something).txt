Slipping (Into Something) LyricsLooking for something
Eyes closed in suspense
Waiting for someone
Does it make any sense?
Only an hour
To make it all mine
Hardly worth waiting
And I don't have the time
Search for conviction
With eyes open wide
Feeling so restless
So empty inside
Plenty of chances
And no one will win
Over and over
And over again
Needing somebody
Needing some help
Slipping into something
And out of something elseEmbed
