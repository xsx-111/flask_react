Slow Down LyricsHold on
Keep on trying ...
Keep on trying
Slow Down
You can make it
Try and make it
It's so hard
Making promises
Breaking promises
It's alright
It's alright
Got a lot to learn
Got a ways to go
When ya gonna learn
What a way to go
Hold on
Slow down
So hard
Alright
Got a lot to learn
Got a ways to go
When ya gonna learn
What a way to go
Slow downEmbed
