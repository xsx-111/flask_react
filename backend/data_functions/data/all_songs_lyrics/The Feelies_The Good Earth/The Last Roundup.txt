The Last Roundup Lyrics
Out in the orchards
Down by the barn
Someone is calling
"Come around, come around."

Late that night
Hearing voices
Empty cars
Out on the highway
Slowing down
Waiting for morning to come

Looking for anyone
Down by the water
Nobody's talking
Look around, look around

Late that night
Distant voices
Empty cars
Out on the highway
Slowing down
Waiting for morning to come
Down in the cellar
Over in a corner
Somebody's yelling
"I'm coming out, I'm coming down."

Late that night
Hearing voices
Burning cars
Out on the highway
On the ground
Praying for morning to comeEmbed
