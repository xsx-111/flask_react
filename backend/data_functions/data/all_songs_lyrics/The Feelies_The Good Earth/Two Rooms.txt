Two Rooms LyricsOut from the yard
Out in the dark
Let it go on
Let it go on
Become what you are
Become what you are
Can't be too hard
Can't be too hard
The offer is hard
The right time to start
Time to go on
Right from the heart
Become what you are
Become what you are
Can't be too hard
Can't be too hard
Become what you are
Become what you are
Can't be too hard
Can't be too hardEmbed
