Tomorrow Today LyricsHow can you go home?
Turning back (alone?)
Can't (?) gone outside
???
It's better talking
Right from the start
You get excited
I fall apart
Again
There you are
You won't go too far
Can't pretend
???
It's better talking
Right from the start
We get excited
We fall apart
AgainEmbed
