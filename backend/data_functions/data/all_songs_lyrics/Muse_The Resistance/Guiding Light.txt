Guiding Light LyricsPure hearts stumble
In my hands, they crumble
Fragile and stripped to the core
I can't hurt you anymore
Loved by numbers
You're losing life's wonder
Touch like strangers; detached
I can't feel you anymore
The sunshine trapped in our hearts
It could rise again
But I'm lost, crushed, cold and confused with no guiding light left inside
You were my guiding light
When comfort and warmth can't be found I still reach for you
But I'm lost, crushed, cold and confused with no guiding light left inside
You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
When there's no guiding light left inside
When there's no guiding light in our lives2Embed
