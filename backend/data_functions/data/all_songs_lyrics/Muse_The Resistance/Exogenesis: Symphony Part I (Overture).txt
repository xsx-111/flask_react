Exogenesis: Symphony Part I (Overture) LyricsAping my soul
You stole my overture
Trapped in God's program
Oh I can't escape
Who are we?
Where are we?
When are we?
Why are we?
Who are we?
Where are we?
Why, why, why?
I can't forgive you
And I can't forget
Who are we?
Where are we?
When are we?
Why are we in here?
Who are we?
Where are we?
When are we?
Why are we in here?2Embed
