MK Ultra Lyrics
The wavelength gently grows
Coercive notions re-evolve
A universe is trapped inside a tear
It resonates the core
Creates unnatural laws
Replaces love and happiness with fear

How much deception can you take?
How many lies will you create?
How much longer until you break?
Your mind's about to fall
And they are breaking through
And they are breaking through
They are breaking through
(We are losing control)
They are breaking through
They are breaking through
They are breaking through
Now we are falling
(We are losing control)

Invisible to all
The mind becomes a wall
All of history
Deleted with one stroke
How much deception can you take?
How many lies will you create?
How much longer until you break?
Your mind's about to fall
And they are breaking through
They're breaking through
They're breaking through
Now we're falling
We are losing control6Embed
