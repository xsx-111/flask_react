Tonite It Shows LyricsInto a dream, I took a turn, and promised to return
The way we were, the way we met, the way I lit your cigarette
The way it trailed, into a stream, and lay down between
You had to choose, a side to lose, and divide yourself in two
The way you were, long before, you were a walkin' civil war
But you forget, where the road goes, and tonight it shows
Into your soul, I tried to climb, but found the hole to high
For me to leave, the way I'd learned, and found I couldn't turn
The way the trees, and fallin' rain, remind me in a way
The way you were, the day we met, the way I lit your cigarette
The way it changed, into a strange, Cole Porter phrase
But you forget, how the song goes, and tonite it showsEmbed
