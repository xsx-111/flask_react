The Funny Bird LyricsWell, goodbye southern spy, I've come to love you in the light
Always staring in the void, have your eyes all been destroyed
All these digging little hands of all the stones that never land
You're the only one I know
And farewell golden ring, oh, you hollow little thing
Like a wave along the coast I've come to love the highs and lows
When in the end your just a band a funny bird that never lands
And you're the only one I know
Farewell golden sound, no one wants to hear you now
And of all the happy ends, I wouldn't wish this on a friend
But you're the only one I know1Embed
