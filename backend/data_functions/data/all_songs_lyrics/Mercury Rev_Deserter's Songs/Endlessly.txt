Endlessly LyricsStanding in a dream
Weaving thru' the crowded streets
Leaving you again endlessly
The choir disappears
An' voices in yr head appear
Leading you again endlessly
If th' armies of her soul
Take you by surprise an' flee
Leaving you again endlessly
An th' darkships of her eyes
Surrender t' you suddenly
Leading you again endlessly
Standing in a street
Th' line beneath th' fallin' leaves
Leading her again endlessly
An' of all th' stars above
Only one reminds her of
Leaving you again endlessly2Embed
