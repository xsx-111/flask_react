Opus 40 LyricsWell she tossed all night like a raging sea
Woke up and climbed from the suicide machine
With her Spanish candles and her Persian poems
Stuck on the rocks inside Opus 40 stoned
And scratching her wrists in the pouring rain
She collapses down upon the ocean floor
Again
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Nights alone by your side
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Nights alone by your side
Catskill mansions, buried dreams
"I'm alive" she cried
"but I don't know what it means"
But somewhere out there across the moonlit sands
There's a line drawn, like the lines on her own hand
And slamming her eyes, locking the door
She collapses down upon the ocean floor
Again
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Nights alone by your side
Tears in waves, minds on fire
Nights alone by your side2Embed
