Goddess on a Hiway Lyrics
Well, I got us on a highway, I got us in a car
Got us going faster than we've ever gone before
I got us on a highway, I got us in a car
Got us going faster than we've ever gone before

And I know it ain't gonna last
And I know it ain't gonna last
When I see your eyes arrive
They explode like two bugs on glass

Far above the ocean, deep under the sea
There's a river running dry cause of you and me
Far above the ocean, deep under the sea
There's a river running dry cause of you and me

And I know it ain't gonna last
And I know it ain't gonna last
When I see your eyes arrive
They explode like two bugs on glass

She's a goddess on a highway, a goddess in a car
A Goddess going faster than she's ever gone before
She's a goddess on the highway, a goddess in a car
A Goddess going faster than she's ever gone before
And I know it ain't gonna last
And I know it ain't gonna last
When I see your eyes arrive
They explode like two bugs on glass

And I know it ain't gonna last
And I know it ain't gonna last
And I know it ain't gonna last
And I know it ain't gonna last
It ain't gonna last
It ain't gonna last
It ain't gonna last
It ain't gonna last...2Embed
