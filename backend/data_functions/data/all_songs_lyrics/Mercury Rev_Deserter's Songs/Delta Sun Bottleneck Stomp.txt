Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp LyricsSee the corporate sea, Atlantic's too specific
Haven't time to settle, sharks infest the water
Kicking up the dust, constructing new ideals
Old ones laid to rust, nothing seems so real
Sliding away in a washed out delta sun
Missionaries flood, my favorite A.M. stations
Flowing in their futures, washed out in this delta rag
Look the other way, pocket all the pieces
Tripping up the straw hat, tumble into the wind
Sliding away in a washed out delta sun
Sliding away in a washed out delta sun
Waving goodbye, I'm not saying hello
Waving goodbye, I'm not saying hello
Waving goodbye, I'm not saying hello
Waving goodbye, I'm not saying hello, helloEmbed
