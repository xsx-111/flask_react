Numbered Days LyricsDaisy
I never thought I'd go
Crazy
But I never thought you so
Until now that I see
All the crazy things you're doing
Why you wanna ruin it
And me?
Counting numbered days
Lately
I think you know it's true
That's it
It's all over, I'm through
For a while we can smile
For the people that we're passing
And even if they're asking
We can lie
Counting numbered days
Looks like the sun is gonna set
Know that there's nothing I regret
All the things that I learned
Well, I'd like to think I earned it
No need to go and burn it down now
Counting numbered days
Counting numbered days
Ooh, oohEmbed
