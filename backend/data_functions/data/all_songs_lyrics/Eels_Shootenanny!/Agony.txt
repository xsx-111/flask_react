Agony LyricsTake five, take five
Am I gonna be alright?
No, I'm not gonna be alright
Nothin' is alright now
Am I gonna see the sun come up?
Or am I going down?
Cause everyday I'm here
All I feel is sheer agony
Friends tellin' me that maybe I need
Some pychiatric help
Yeah, they're always so quick to tell you
Just how to get over it
But I look into the mirror
And all I see is age, fear
And agony
If I could just remember what it was like
When I was younger
Before all the joy and happiness
Was replaced with hunger
Now all I've got to show
For the seeds that didn't grow
Is agony1Embed
