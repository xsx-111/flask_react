Rock Hard Times LyricsThey told me that I couldn't come back here again
Took me for some kind of fool
Said I was doing things that never should be done
But I don't care about their rules
As if I cared 'bout the little minds
In the little heads of the herd
There's nothing you could dream
Would be more absurd
And everybody knows
These are rock hard times
I gotta make it through
These are rock hard times
I don't know what it is they're trying to do to me
Make me into some sick joke
But no one's laughing and least of all, not me
It's hard to laugh as you choke
Hollywood lies piled up to the sky
Floating your way soon
Hope you like the rotten stench of doom
And everybody knows
These are rock hard times
I gotta make it through
These are rock hard times
And everybody knows
These are rock hard times
I gotta make it through
These are rock hard times
I don't know what it is they think I'm gonna try
They don't know what they need to fear
The surest sign that the end is coming soon
Is right there in the bathroom mirror
Everybody knows
These are rock hard times
I gotta make it through
These are rock hard times
These are rock hard timesEmbed
