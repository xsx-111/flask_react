Restraining Order Blues LyricsLife goes on
Nothing is new
Judge made it clear
I can't be near you
Everybody knows that I'm not a violent man
Just someone who knows he's in love
I made mistakes
Everyone does
Don't know why I did
I guess just because
No one gets through to me the way that you do
Now I know I'm in love
Baby, it's a little much
To never touch you
When I know I'll never
Find another love like this
Life goes on
Nothing is new
Passing the days
Thinking 'bout you
Everybody knows that I'm not a violent man
Just someone who knows he's in loveEmbed
