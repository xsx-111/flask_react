Sad Foot Sign LyricsSad foot sign
Why you gotta taunt me this way?
The happy side is broken now
It's gonna be an awful day
And if I have to drive back by
To see from a different side
Would it be enough to say
The first time was a lie?
Sad foot sign "The end is coming."
That's what they say
Maybe you could see it in
Your heart for one day
To let me feel what it's about
To really be alive
To live and breathe and see and feel
Then I can die
And when I come back to this world
I'll put on the uniform
And go into the foot sign shop
Where you were bornEmbed
