Wrong About Bobby LyricsI was wrong about Bobby, I admit
He's not the dumbest angry, young nitwit
No he can cut it with the best
And you'd better get out of his way
His girlfriend keeps him living in
A world where fear will always win
And if you see him out tonight
Well, you'd better get out of his way
You gotta give it up for the new modern man
He's gonna have a ball, give it all that he can
Someday he's gonna show us all, I bet
Out in the sun while we're all soaking wet
If it's a dry life that you want
Then you'd better get out of his way
You gotta give it up for the new modern man
He's gonna have a ball, give it all that he can
I was wrong about Bobby, don't you know
He's had it tough and he had to make a go
But if he doesn't stop fucking with me
Well, he'd better get out of my way
Yeah, he'd better get out of my way
He'd better get out of my wayEmbed
