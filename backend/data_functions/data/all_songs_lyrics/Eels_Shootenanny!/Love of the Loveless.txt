Love of the Loveless LyricsDon't got a lot of time
Don't give a damn
Don't tell me what to do
I am the man
If there's a God up there
Something above
God, shine your light down here
Shine on the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
Don't have too many friends
Never felt at home
Always been my own man
Pretty much alone
I know how to get through
And when push comes to shove
I got something that you need
I got the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
The love of the loveless
All around you people walking
Empty hearts and voices talking
Looking for and finding
Nothing
Don't got a lot of time
Don't really care
Not selling anything
Buyer beware
If there's a God up there
Something above
God, shine your light down here
Shine on the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
The love of the loveless
Don't got a lot of time
Don't give a damn
Don't tell me what to do
I am the man
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
The love of the loveless
Love of the loveless1Embed
