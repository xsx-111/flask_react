The Singer LyricsI can hear the sound
When my love's around
Whistle in the trees
It sits inside the breeze
When my love’s around
Sing, sing (louder, louder)
Sing, sing (louder, louder)
Now I feel so down
Shuffling on the ground
So come hold me
We won’t be found
When my love’s around
So sing (louder, louder)
So sing (louder, louder)1Embed
