Oh mister
Mister Main
I need to know
How you ride it, oh so plain
Riding it low

Oh mister
Oh mister
I need to
I need to know

Oh mister
Mister Main
I need to know
How keep it clean
So I can keep it low

Oh mister
Oh mister
Oh mister
Oh mister  (You keep it low)

He said you know I love you
I'll keep it slow
]
I need to know (It slow)
I need to know (It slow)
I need to know (Slow)
I need to knowEmbed
