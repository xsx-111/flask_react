The Feels LyricsNow when I look into your eyes
I realize you're the same as me
Just wanted to be free
And when we look into the skies
We realize it just can't be
We'll never be free
And where are your friends?
Where are they now?
And your family don't need you now
O, it's only a dream
Yes, it's only a dream
Pick yourself up
Walk down the street
Feel the freaks
That you shall meet
They are your family now
They are your family now
And when I look into your eyes
I realize you're the same as me
You'll never be freeEmbed
