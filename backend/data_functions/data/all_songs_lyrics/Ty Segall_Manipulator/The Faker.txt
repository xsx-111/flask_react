The Faker Lyrics
I'm the faker with the other name
On the paper riding on the fame
I will make you see and to believe
For the longing of the other sleeve

Ask your boss man
For a raise
Tell your momma
She better keep the change

Dream taker, with the other face
Coat duster, riding on the place
He will make you see and to believe
For the longing of the other sleeve

Ask your boss man
For a raise
Tell your momma
She better keep the change

Ask your boss man
For a raise
Tell your momma
She better keep the change, keep the change
Keep the changeEmbed
