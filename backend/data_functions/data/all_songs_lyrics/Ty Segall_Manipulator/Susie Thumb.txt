Susie Thumb LyricsSusie wants to view
All the latest news
Sitting on the screen
She wants to be free
Maybe I can get to my thumb
Maybe I can see what's done
Maybe she'll make it to TV
Oh maybe she'll see
Susie wants to be
On all the TVs
Sitting in the screen
She waits for you and me
Maybe she can last a while
Maybe it's cause of her smile
Maybe she'll make it to TV
Oh maybe we'll see...Embed
