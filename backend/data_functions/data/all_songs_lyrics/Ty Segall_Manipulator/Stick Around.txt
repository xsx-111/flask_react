Stick Around LyricsAnd although
We have to go
You know you wanna stick around
When I’m gone
I may be down
You know I wanna stick around
And it’s love
When we play
You know we gonna play all day
So come down
Let’s make a sound
Oh yeah, let’s stick around
Well, come on
Come on down
Yeah, stick around
We are here
Let’s make a sound
You know, we're gonna stick aroundEmbed
