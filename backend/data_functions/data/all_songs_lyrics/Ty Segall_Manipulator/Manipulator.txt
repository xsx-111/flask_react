Manipulator LyricsCheap love, I’m wrapped in milk
Drug rug that’s smooth as silk
You are the blood line guilt
Manipulator

Oooh, ooh, ooh (manipulator)
I use your telephone
To sneak inside your home
My finest friend
Manipulator

Oooh, ooh, ooh (manipulator)
Oooh, ooh, ooh (manipulator)
(Manipulator, manipulator, manipulator, manipulator)
(Manipulator, manipulator, manipulator, manipulator)Embed
