Green Belly LyricsI've seen the green
In the belly of your eyes
That scene you've seen
It gives me no surprise
He's gonna make a movie
Of his entire life
He wants to figure
How to do it right
Oh yeah
So he needs that big man
With the big plan
To step right in
He fell down from the sky
He knew why we had to win
He's gonna make a movie
Of his entire life
She will cry "why?"
Bye, bye
Ohh
Bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
Ohh
Bye, ye
Bye, bye, bye
He's gonna make a movie
Of his entire life
She will cry
She will cry "why?"
Oh yeahEmbed
