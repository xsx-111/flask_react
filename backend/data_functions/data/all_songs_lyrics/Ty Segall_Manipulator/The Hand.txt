The Hand LyricsYour aggression friend takes you to the end
Speaking orally drags you by your hand
He's a number man
A true fraction
Functioning, practicing
Drags you by your hand

You listen only to the hand
Leading you only to the plan
I see the rat race sitting in the home
It's just the same place
You're all alone

You listen only to the hand
Leading you only to the planEmbed
