Hopefully Lyrics
I won't ask you where you're going
I won't ask you where you been
I know after a million times, you get sick of all my lines
But I just want to see you safe again
I know that just now I ain't been showing
The kind of love you know that I can
So give me a little while and you'll be knowing
Your good loving baby is back on top again

Hopefully it occurs to me
That there's one thing I can't stand
That's the thought of one single day
Without your head in my hand

I always hoped you'd be showing
And now you've shown as much as you can
But after each time, I'm still glowing
With a good loving smile that's yours until the end

Hopefully it occurs to me
That there's one thing I can't stand
That's the thought of one single day
Without your head in my hand4Embed
