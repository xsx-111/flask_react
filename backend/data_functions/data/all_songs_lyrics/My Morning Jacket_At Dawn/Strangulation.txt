Strangulation Lyrics
Strangulation, I don't want to feel a thing
When your hands close tight around my neck
And force the air that I breathe

I don't want to feel a thing
I don't want to feel a thing

Yes, she was a young girl, about the age of 23
But somehow the Lord never smiled down upon her
So she flew out on a breeze

Said I don't want to feel a thing
I don't want to feel a thing

I'm sure he was a good kid, but his phone it'd never ring
He got tired of walking a tightrope
Needing too much to drink, so he got on a knee

I don't want to feel a thing
I know there's someone who loves up above
Wants to fix you a drink
Want to sit down and think
Wanna pour you a drink
You won't feel a thing
You won't feel a thing
You won't feel a thing
You won't feel a thing2Embed
