At Dawn LyricsAt dawn they ride again
They'll haul you out to the street
They'll burn your papers in your empty trash cans
Beat this thought into your head
Singin' over and over again
All your life is obscene
Forget the papers, forget your musical dreams
But that's when my knife rises
Their life ends and my life starts again
Again, again, again, againEmbed
