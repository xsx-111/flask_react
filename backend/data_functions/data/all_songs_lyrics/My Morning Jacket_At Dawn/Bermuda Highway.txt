Bermuda Highway Lyrics
Sometimes I walk around town lookin' at faces
Wonderin' why their bodies go to silly places
Walkin' past carpet mills, lookin' in, takin' stills
Your ass it draws me in like a Bermuda Highway

Oh, don’t carve me out
Don’t let your silly dreams
Fall in between
The crack of the bed and the wall

Two times I fell asleep in a dirty basement
Snoozing in cobwebs and the cement
Sometimes I wonder why the meek guy got all the fame
Maybe I’m to blame for his short bitter fucked-up life

Oh, don’t carve me out
Don’t let your silly dreams
Fall in between
The crack of the bed and the wall3Embed
