Phone Went West LyricsIs there a doctor in the house tonight?
If there's a wrong, he could make it right
Is there still a lock on your back door?
Is there still a lock on your back door?
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm right
Tell me there's nobody else in the world
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm right
Tell me there's nobody else in the world
Is there a doctor in your house tonight?
If there's a wrong, he could make it right
Is there still a lock on your back door?
Is there still a lock on your back door?
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm right
Tell me there's nobody else in the world
Tell me I'm wrong, tell me I'm right
Tell me there's nobody else in the world
Tell me there's nobody else in the world
Tell me there's nobody else in the world
There'll be a knock on your front door
There'll be a knock on your front door
There'll be a knock on your front door
There'll be a knock on your back door
There'll be a knock on your back door
There'll be a knock on your back door
There'll be a knock on your back door
There'll be a knock on your back door7Embed
