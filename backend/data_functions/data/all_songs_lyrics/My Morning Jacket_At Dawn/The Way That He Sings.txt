The Way That He Sings LyricsWhy’s it strange how they say that the world’s moving upwards?
Why’s it surreal when my hand feels it can’t roll the dice?
Why’s it so great just to wake every day alive and by your side?
It’s a mystery, I guess
There’s lots of things that I can’t find
It’s not the way that you look
But your move that catches my eye
Why is it soft when the cannons unload on the others?
Why’re we so loud when we say it won’t happen to us?
Why does my mind blow to bits every time they play that song?
It’s just the way that he sings
Not the words that he says or the band
I’m in love with this soul
It’s a meaning that I understand6Embed
