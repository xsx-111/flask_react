Lowdown LyricsLowdown, cheating, sure no need for repeating
So love, dawn, can't you see
That you never got to fight with me?
No, you never got to fight with me
Hurting, beating, ain't no need for repeating
So love, dawn, can't you see
That you never got to bleed for me?
Chancing, glancing, so enough mood for romancing
So love, dawn, can't you see
That you only got to dance with me?
Yeah, you only got to dance with me
Yeah, you only got to dance with me
Yeah, you only got to dance with me2Embed
