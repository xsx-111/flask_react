I Needed It Most Lyrics
I needed it most when I was eighteen
But now that I'm older, I don't need many things
Just someone to hold, that's what you give me
When dark touches your skull, babe
Aw baby, you drop that on me
So I say Lord, all the Heavens you've made
Can't hold back the ghosts that haunt my baby and me
Oh can't you hold 'em back from coming on in?
To a lovely woman that just wants her mind back again
I cannot crumble what you want this to be
Or bring peace of mind, ain't there to see
Aw, if you don't know yourself, how could you ever know me?
But to have and to hold, yeah that's the way it's got to be3Embed
