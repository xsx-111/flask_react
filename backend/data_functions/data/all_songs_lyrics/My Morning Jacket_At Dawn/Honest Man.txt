Honest Man Lyrics
Try to walk this earth an honest man
But evil waves at me its ugly hand
The radar watches me from above
Shouting down, "I hope you make it on this earth"
Sometimes this world will leave you, Lord
Kicking and a-screaming
Wondering if you'll see the next day through
But as for me, I do believe
That good luck comes from trying
So until I get mine, I'll work me the whole day through7Embed
