If It Smashes Down Lyrics
Who's going to care
If it smashes down
Or flips you up in the air?
It's just a really fast
Risky ride at a fair
On these lovely trips
The conductor likes
Your soft brown eyes on his hair
No need to shut her down
Go round and round
In the air

Who's going to care
If it smashes down
Or flips you up in the air?
It's just a really fast
Risky ride at a fair
On these lovely trips
The conductor likes
Your soft brown eyes on his hair
No need to shut her down
Go round and round
In the air
In the air
In the air
In the air...Embed
