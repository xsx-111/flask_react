Just Because I Do Lyrics
I go blind, every night
And just because I do
I'm wishing you'd get better
And I'll get rid of you

I saw it in a letter
I saw it in a letter
I saw it in a letter

I go blind, every night
And just because I do
I'm writing off a letter
To save yourself some glue
Every night you talk in disguise
And girl that ain't like you
I'm wishing you'd get better
And I'll get rid of you


I go blind, every night
And just because I do
I'm wishing you'd get better
And I'll get rid of you
I'll get rid of you 2Embed
