Death Is the Easy Way LyricsSome say death is the easy way and I think they're right
Because nights tick by like a long week except when you stop by
I know that trying gets nothing done and I see you're about dry
'Cause nothing gets you high, you're poor the day you die
And alcohol, it only makes you tired
But seeing you feels good and it's always understood
That anything much sweeter would make me die
Daytime rolling back the wine ?? unwind
Some say death is the easy way and I think they're right
'Cause nothing gets you high, you're poor the day you die
And alcohol, it only makes you tired
But seeing you feels good and it's always understood
That anything much sweeter would make me die1Embed
