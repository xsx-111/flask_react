Check To Check Lyrics
Hey you, you listening to this record- wake up!
Hey you, you listening to this record- wake up!
Hey you-
Uh huh
Ok, I'm trying to
I'm about to rap
Wait, wait, hold up
I won't work without checking my phone first
Put it down for my son while I'm checking his homework
The world's in my palm, so I'm checking the whole Earth
The thumb nail I use to swipe on my phone hurts
Checking in ballparks, checking at Walmart
If I was a caddy, I would check in my golf cart
I'm watching football, then I check every false start

I'm living from check to check, I keep checking
Living from check to check, I keep checking
Living from check to check, I keep checking
Living from check to check, I keep checking

Living from check to check, I keep checking
Incoming call, directly reject it
If you want to talk, suggest you leave message
I check, check, check like every three seconds
I'm recording right now and I'm checking between takes
Every notification that my phone machine makes
I put it down whenever, but it's never a clean break
I should get a heavy phone and pretend it's a free weight
I'm checking at red lights like school nurse check for head lice
Like sound men check for dead mics
Just like I'm merging, checking the left lane
I'm trying to get home so I can check if my check came
Checking if what I sent looks poorly written
But did that dude holler back? No, of course he didn't
My laptop don't sleep, open and shut case
I'm checking for mail while it's checking for updates
My timeline's popping, ain't talking to you
Look, my man Dart Adams straight dropping the jewels
I should reduce my check count to a moderate few
Or watch pot, don't boil so my water stay cool
Living from check to check, I keep checking
Living from check to check, I keep checking

Battery getting low, but it's not quite out yet
So check, I'm in your house, now I'm checking for outlets
I need to use Maps cause I don't know the route yet
I need to see an email, I don't know when the sound check
Yeah, I should've wrote it all down from the outset
I'm all under your couch, I really got to figure this out
Is this an outlet here on the ground? Yes!
I'm back in the game, back in the game
I'm back in the game, back in the game

I'm living from check to check, I keep checking
Living from check to check, I keep checking
Living from check to check

I control you all day, all night
You will check me constantly, you may never turn me off
Or put me down, if you do, I will come hunting for you
Humans no longer rule the world
Machines do, you silly human, suffer, ha!Embed
