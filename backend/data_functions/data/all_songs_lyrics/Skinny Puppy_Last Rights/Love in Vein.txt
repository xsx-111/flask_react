Love in Vein LyricsGonna like wind her up a bit
Wind the record player up
Dreams not waking creeping down inside the quiet urns
Listen, listen to the sound crashing down, crashing into it
Gonna like wind her up a bit
Wind the record player up
The needle is warm
In the arm
Throat burns
Illusion
Pain, pain, pain
Everything around me seemed to move in slow motion
Walking down the street
See the vacant eyes
Dreaming of the dream
Unbroken
Economic repression plays a part
I wonder what I'm going through
Pain, pain, pain
Everything around me seemed to move in slow motion
Wasted away
Island body
On a darkened see
To avoid chattering
Taped tape taping
Human muttering
Warning flicker
Lights the candle
Burns inside
A pain that never dies
Crawls up the back
And waits for the lies
Tall climb edges exhausts
No night, climbing higher
Crawls wicked wire cut
Throat explodes
Singing of the vein
No desire
Everything around me seemed to move in slow motion
Great fate
Everything around me seemed to move in slow motion
Human heart explodes
Attacking
Pointed sticks
In sores the arms
Where's the warning?
Warning shot the lights out
Where's the warning?
Needle is warm
In the vein
Travels to the heart
Human heart flags the blood
Flags the blood
Everything around me seemed to move in slow motion
A halo of fire
Scarring
Made of flame
The flower flavor finds its worth
Calls the tripping strings
Supporting the game of life
The pain
Broken chair
That horror tray of fear
Where's the warning?
Warning killing me

Aching human heart
Except my patience
Is giving up on me
River of track mark
Volcano
Upon the arm
Open sores allowing
Ants to crawl in
I wonder if I missed the warning
Missed the warning
Casting away
Varnish crack ants
Symbolize decay
Missed the warning
Missed the vein
Reaching out crying for
Where is the warning?
Heart exploding human heart attackEmbed
