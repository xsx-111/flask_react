Knowhere? LyricsA leech passing unseen kicked in mouth firm will prove sex slave all encompasses high gets you by broken glass in a crystal blown problem room and one day you will have no one to run to self self-satisfier burns the genitals down no sensation promise your heart to the slut who slept in your bed in her bed (in your head) where it must have some reason in all I said in his head all I said (?) nowhere to run to one of two looks back wanna know which one is real and the naked arm that heals the jaw you will see the truth so what your gift is misused your gift is misused your gift your gift is a curse of it all (?) when it is done you will have no one to run to no one to run toEmbed
