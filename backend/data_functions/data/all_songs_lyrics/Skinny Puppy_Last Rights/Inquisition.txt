Inquisition LyricsLatent manner
Speak parting
Bonding cement no longer holds
Parting fits
Too young to grow old
Addicted romance
Love tested
Healing from substance abuse
Wicked resenting
Never faces itself
Torturer taints
Animal waits
No environment
Torturer laughing
Righteous
Real-time intrusion
Fears filtered
For reasons unknown
Cancer attack
Leaching
Desserts so sweet
Leaves bitter taste in the mouth
Forever
Torurer taints
Animal waits
Corners creeping fear
Tasting force-fed lies of the wicked
Acting out fears
False truths turned around
Wicked torture
Wicked, wicked
Pain
The wicked words of the torturer
Abusing and controlling anyone
That's useful to him
Wicked waiting of the torturer
Wicked waits the toturer
(Torture, torture, torture)
Reads story
Truth seething
Believed poison
Eaten, swallows
Turning away
Torturer taints animal
With hate, enlightenment
Turned away
No change
The wicked
Not facing himself
Controls turning away
Wicked torturer
Force-fed torment
Animal torture
Torturer turning away
Wicked torturer
Wicked not facing his self
Wicked turning away
Wicked turning away
Turning away
Disappearing from himself
Tortures the animal
Tortures the animalEmbed
