Screen Lyrics
Here's the best thing that I ever wanted
I'll do my best to justify all of your actions
The way you do your hair and
The clearing of the truth as I see
And hold on to nothing, to lay out of bed
Of the lords favorite ring
Hold on for miles, be real
Aw, aw

And you'll never know just how dark this screen could be
No, you'll never know just how dark this screen could be

The reason I'm living high at the moment
Is probably hard to understand
Lay back and never let the wonder
Get away and run 'til that's all that I can do

And you'll never know just how dark this screen could be
No, you'll never know just how dark this screen could be
Will you ever know just how dark this screen could be?

Here is the best thing
That I ever wanted
And I'll do my best to justify
All of my actions, so be real, yeah, yeah
Sha-na-na, sha-na-na
Sha-na-na, sha-na-na-na
Sha-na-na, sha-na-na
Sha-na-na, sha-na-na (Sha-na-na, sha-na-na)
And you'll never know just
Never know just how dark this screen could be
No, you'll never know just
Never know just how dark this screen could be
And you'll never know just (This place could be)
Never know just how dark this place could be
No, you'll never know just (This place could be)
Never know just how dark this place could be
No, you'll never know
Never know just how dark this screen could be
No, you'll never know
I'll sing alongEmbed
