Raise Love Lyrics
(One, two, three, four)

Welcome now where we belong
Then hit 'em while they're new
Givin' up my action
I swear that'll come to you
And tell me if it seems that
They have given you the fine
And what'll you define the world
That'll make the life to lose

And raise love
To highlight
The world's dream
And ecstasy, problems and attitude

I'll take from this and I swear
There won't be nothing left to do
To give it up would just be the best
Yeah, egos come to you
And in that darkest hour you scream out
Leaving by the pain
The reason I'll make it my lady
Let this time again
I'll raise love
To highlight
The world's dream
And ecstasy, yeah, yeah

Ah, the people say, the lord says
Get down on it, raise
Get up on it, ain't got nothing, said
Get down on it, yeah
Get down on it, said ain't no sentence from you, yeah
Ain't got nothin' to do, yeah
Raise my mind
I think I'm fallin'
And yeah
Far away from home, yeah

And raise love
To highlight
The world's dream
And ecstasy, runnin' with attitude

Raise love
To raise love
To raise love
Oh, raise love
Highlight
Yeah
Yes, indeed
It ain't got nothin' to do
Yes, indeed
Not my crew
Yes, indeed
It ain't got nothin' for you
Yes, I swear
It's all in the groove
Shake itEmbed
