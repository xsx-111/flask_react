Buttercup Lyrics
And I love to tie you up
And you love to let me down
We both try to cover it up
With the sound
Ain't my buttercup
You ain't my little tool
I know that ain't a part of the deal
We're through, let me tell you

It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
And I love to share the cost
Butterfly
The reason why I need to fly
High away, yeah

It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time
It's just a matter of time

Before we're thrown back in the wheel
Before we're thrown back in the wheel
Before we're thrown back in the wheel
Before we're thrown back in the wheel
It may be that I'll be hard-pressed
Maybe we're more simple too
Ain't a region of water

Before we get back in the wheel
Before we get back in the wheel
Before we get back in the wheel
Before we get back in the wheelEmbed
