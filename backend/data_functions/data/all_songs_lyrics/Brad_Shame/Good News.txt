Good News Lyrics
Gather around and choose the fare
All these weapons are free
Carrying armor
'Til I can't feel my hands

Gather 'round sisters, and change for us all
'Cause I know better than to lay my hands on the ground

And out of this urge, I crumble down
Rollin' the burdens on you
And I don't know nothin'
When I don't understand
Yeah, yeah

Gather 'round sisters, and change for us all
'Cause I know better than to lay my hands on the ground
So give it up

It's never been news to me
It's never been news to me
It's never been news to me
Gather up and rise around, there's a circus in town (Hey, yeah)
And he'll tell you it ain't free (Hey, yeah, yeah, uh)
Freakshow orders, uh
And I don't understand
Yeah, yeah, oh

Gather 'round sisters, and lay down your arms
'Cause I wanna show, there's a reason forgetting a mind, yeah

It's never been news to me (Oh, you're breaking me out)
It's never been news to me (Oh, you're breaking me out)
It's never been news to me (Oh, you're breaking me out)
It's never been news to me (Me)
