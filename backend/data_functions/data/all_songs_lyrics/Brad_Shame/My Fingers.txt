My Fingers Lyrics
Yeah-hey, how sublime

Yesterday was quite a day
Now I've made it well
All my tears and worries now
My baby, can't you tell?
But wait, I can send
My mind is scarred
It's mine
Yeah, yeah

Don't have to tell me your reasons, Lord
Don't have to lend me your fingers, God (Don't)
Don't have to reason, you'll dance all night
Don't have to remember your lord all the time (Don't)
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

Yesterday I thought maybe
You got my love a try
I'll go over there and beg too
And let it fly, yeah
Don't have to tell me your reasons, Lord
Don't have to lend me your fingers, God (Don't)
Don't have to let me go wandering
Don't have to let me go wandering
Yeah-yeah-y-yeah-y-yeah, rewind
Mine's alright
Now-now-n-now-n-now
Mine's alright, I know

Don't have to tell me your reasons, Lord
I, I think I'll testify to
All my memories
Don't have to tell me your reasons, 'cause
I probably don't believe in them
They all dragging things
All upside-down when you're so mistaken

Yeah, mm, (Don't)
Don't have to tell me your reasons, Lord
Don't have to tell me your reasons, Lord (Don't)
Don't have to tell me no reasons, Lord
Don't have to tell me your mine's out of sight (Don't)
Don't have to tell me your reasons, Lord
Don't have to lend me no fingers, God (Don't)
Da-na-na-na-n-na-na-na-na
No-no, no-no
Yeah-heh, ah-heh-yeah
Ah-heh-yeah, ah-heh-yeah
Ah-heh-yeah, ah-heh-yeah
Ah-heh-yeah
Let me out, let me be
Let me outEmbed
