Nadine LyricsYeah, I'm all over this
I may be afraid
I'm oversea
And I swear, and I swear
I'd rather be somethin'
Don't worry me with "no better"
Your highway's not main
And I swear, and I swear
If I'd let you wanna be one time
If I'd let you wanna be this time
Guess I'd never be the one to say no
Reach out and sigh, "Yes, nevermind"
If I'd make you give me
Yeah, I'm all over this
I'm into the shelter
My mind is scarred with my name
And I swear, and I swear
Ain't no reason I can't be that line
If I could make you want to make me down
"Yes" stands for nothing left but being at home
If I could make, you might get me wrong
Yes, I can amend you, gather 'round, and I'm gone
Yes, I know and everything that won't go won't shake
And na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Yeah, yeah
