We Lyrics
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is

If there is anything you need
You can get anything for free
Out of the darkness comes a tree
Even out everything you see and rise

And rise
And rise

If you ever feel the need to hide
Go with the honest answer inside
You can tell anyone you find
To rise, to rise, to rise, to rise

To rise, to rise
To rise, to rise
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is
If there is, if there is

Don't laugh at me
Don't you ever laugh at me
You think I'm a child?
You treat me like it, bitch
Aww! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha...
Oh, oh sure, now, now, sure
Now it comes out, now it comes out
That's the last time baby, that's the last straw
I've got all your fuckin' answers, it's past time
Gimme a beer
This isn't the beer that I wanted
You never do anything right
Get back in here
Uh, I've seemed to hear more of the evilness in my headphones, if that's possibleEmbed
