Bad For The Soul Lyrics
I own time, it's your time
You gotta be kidding... you gotta be kidding me!
God damn...
There it is

Bad for the soul
Bad for the soul
Bad for the soul
Bad for the soul

In case you've got the one I put out
I don't got none
Ask, you've got nothing for attitude
I know you got the attitude to say you'll step on me

Oh, bad for the soul
I don't know why she wanted me
Bad for the soul
Bad aloneEmbed
