Down Lyrics
Raise this spine
Run from bottom on up
Color come on
Bring your blessings outside
Step round a window
Or huddle self game bare
Shiver parts were falling
Trance to ingest lava dust
Ease trust catalyst

Down, down
Low release arise altered swoon
Down, down
Spiral churn then suffer some calm

Still trip complaining
Web tangle my word
Love bounded lonely
Unmotional wound
Catch shibboleth grin
Devil dream to show the sphere
Find base to balance
Rattle shake modern myth
Ring a pretty path
Down, down
Low release arise altered swoon
Down, down
Spiral churn then suffer some calm

Down, down
Low release arise altered swoon
Down, down
Spiral churn then suffer some calmEmbed
