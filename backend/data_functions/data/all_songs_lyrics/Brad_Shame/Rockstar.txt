Rockstar Lyrics
I'm a rockstar-water-walker
Walkin' on water
Yes

I run for the border
I swear it's nothin'
I roam 'bout the world and
I swear I'm sad
I worry 'bout nothin'
I sleep only seldom
Aw yeah, I'm a walker
Aw yeah, walk on water
Ah

I'm a rockstar-water-walker, baby
I'm a rockstar-water-walker

I sleep by the fire
And I worry about the action
My hands, and I swear that
It's the end of the world and
We know 'bout nothing
Comes every single somethin'
And on my heart
I'm a rockstar-water-walker, baby
I'm a rockin', walkin' on the water, baby

You don't even know what it means to walk on water
Lookin' in the mirror on a boat in sunshine state
Merits twenty-four seven
I'm a rockstar-water-walker, baby (You!)
I'm on my ownâ€” (You!)
(Big guy!)
(Big guy!)Embed
