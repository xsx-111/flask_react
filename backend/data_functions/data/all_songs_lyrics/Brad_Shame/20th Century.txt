20th Century LyricsWe found a groove
Have a good time
Make sure your seat belts are fastened

(My friends)

Well, I'm swearing to God, yeah, I'm so nervous
I cannot feel anything, save the tip of my finger
Whenever comes just might not be the moment
Raise the roof, yeah, let's get out of this, mm

My friends
Twentieth century
My friends
My friends

Pay attention, y'all, to the signs
Pay attention, yeah, to the questions
Let the energy rise to the moment
Yeah, that look in your eyes, no description

My friends
