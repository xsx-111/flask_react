On Graveyard Hill Lyrics
And when the moon grows smaller
Donna picks out a flower
Gives her a witchy power
There in the witching hour
In the witching hour
Donna's taking her potion
Eating all my devotion
Fucking up my emotion
In the witching hour
Donna picks her a flower
In the witching hour

On the graveyard hill
She's calling out her curse
I'm taking my last breath
With each chapter and each verse
And soon I will be killed

In the poisonous forest
Donna lights up her torches
Her eyes are flying saucers
Her hair is black and gorgeous
I see her down at the crossroads
She can lead you to madness
She's leading me into darkness
In the witching hour
In the witching hour
In the witching hour

On the graveyard hill
She's calling out her curse
I'm taking my last breath
With each chapter and each verse
And soon I will be killed
On the graveyard hill
She's calling out her curse
I'm taking my last breath
With each chapter and each verse
And soon I will be killed

And soon I will be killed4Embed
