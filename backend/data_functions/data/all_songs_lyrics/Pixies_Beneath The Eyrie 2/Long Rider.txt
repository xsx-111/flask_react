Long Rider Lyrics
Have you seen my Desiree?
She rides the sea of silver gray
You'll find her at the end of summer's day

The waves were high and crystal clean
If I were you and you were me
We would do the same as Desiree
Just slay it

Long Rider in the morning tide
She took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Take it away now
Long Rider in the morning tide
She took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Take it away now

I believe in Miki Dora "Da Cat"
I believe in Whitey, Greenough and Nat
I believe in Leonard, Peanuts and Yan
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
I believe, I believe
Have you seen my Desiree?
She rides the wave of silver gray
Just slay it

Long rider in the morning tide
She took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Take it away now
Long Rider in the morning tide
Took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Take it away now
Long Rider in the morning tide
Took the highway to the county line
She wiped out in the modern sense
Just slay itEmbed
