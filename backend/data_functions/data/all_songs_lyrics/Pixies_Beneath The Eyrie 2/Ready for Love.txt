Ready for Love Lyrics
Don't mind the rain
But now it won't stop
You think that I'm vain
But I'm calling your bluff

I'm ready, I'm ready
I'm ready, I'm ready for love

You might think I'm vain
But I'm calling your bluff
I don't mind the rain
But I'm ready for love

I'm no poet, not a sailor
I don't ride the setting sun
I'm succeeding as a "failer"
But I don't want to hurt no one

And I don't mind the rain
Ah, but now it won't stop
You might think I'm vain
But I'm not
You might think I'm vain
But I'm calling your bluff

I'm ready for love
I'm ready for love

You might think I'm vain
But I'm calling your bluff
And I don't mind the rain
But I'm ready for love

So I'll say it once again
I am ready for loveEmbed
