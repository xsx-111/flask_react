St. Nazaire Lyrics
Down at the rocks at St. Nazaire
I drank a bottle and a fuck me prayer
I washed out with the greasy tide
I went down on the Selkie bride

Her daddy's dead and her eyes are black
Smells like spliff and Armagnac
She lost her coat, but I like her style
She lost her head, but I like her smile

I'm all done talking to you, oh
And I don't wanna be true, no
I'm all done talking to you

I drank a bottle and a fuck me prayer
Down at the rocks at St. Nazaire
Her daddy's dead and her eyes are black
I washed out, never going back

I'm all done talking to you, oh
And I don't wanna be true, no
I'm done with talking to you
I'm all done talking to you, oh
And I don't wanna be true, no
I'm done with talking to youEmbed
