Death Horizon Lyrics
This drink is tranquilizing
Just look at us two
Asleep at the beach at Waikiki
So I find it very surprising
That he's coming to you
But I am thankful that he helped me to see

You say he's not around
Aw, would you please?
I've seen you looking down
At me

Have you seen the death horizon
Just there out of view
Way low in the sky beyond the sea?
And I can feel that the temperature's rising
But what can you do?
'Cause that death horizon gonna burn you right through

You say he's not around
Aw, would you please?
I've seen you looking down
At me
Have you seen the death horizon
Just there out of view
Way low in the sky beyond the sea?Embed
