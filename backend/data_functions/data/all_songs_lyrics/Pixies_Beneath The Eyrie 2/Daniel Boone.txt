Daniel Boone Lyrics
Last night I was driving around
Nothing to do
Thinking of you
I sighted here on the bend
Reindeer and then it was through

And I floated toward the moon
And I noted from on high
That the Lord Howe reef
Looks like Daniel Boone
And he was showing me his smile

Last night I was driving around
Nothing to do
Thinking of you
I sighted there on the bend
Reindeer and then it was through

And I floated toward the moon
And I noted from on high
That the Lord Howe reef
Looks like Daniel Boone
And he was showing me his smile
Sometimes
I see white
Sometimes
Blue
Blue

And I'm floating down to you
And I'm noting from on high
That the Lord Howe reef
Looks like Daniel Boone
And he is showing me his smile
And he is showing me his smile4Embed
