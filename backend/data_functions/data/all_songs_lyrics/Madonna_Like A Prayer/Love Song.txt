Love Song Lyrics
Je suis prête
Vous êtes prêt aussi?

Are you wasting my time?
Are you just being kind?
Oh no baby
My love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time?
Are you just being kind?
Don't give me one of your lines

Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong
This is not a love song

Are you just being kind? (No-o)
Am I losing my mind? (Losing your mind)
Oh no baby
Yeah

Are you wasting my time? (Wasting my time)
Are you just being kind?
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time? (Time, time, time)
Are you just being kind?
Don't go give me one of your lines
Say what you mean, mean what you say
Don't go and throw our love away
God strike me dead if I did you wrong (Did you wrong)
This is not a love song

Ooh, are you just being kind?
What?
Am I losing my mind?
Don't
Wait

Time goes by so slowly for those who wait
And those who run
Seem to have all the fun
But am I wasting my time?
She's so fine
Are you just being kind?
No

Come try to tell me what your enemies taught you
Show them never how I didn't do you wrong
That this is not a love song
Ooh, are you just being kind? (No-o)
Am I losing my mind? (Losing your mind)
Oh no, baby
Yeah

Are you wasting my time? (Wasting my time)
Are you just being kind?
Oh no baby, my love isn't blind
Are you wasting my time? (Time, time, time)
Are you just being kind?
Don't go give me one of your lines

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
That's how I feel
Don't fog my mind
(Don't)
Mean what you say or baby I am gone
This is not a love song

Ooh are you just being kind?
(Embrasse-moi)
(What?)
Am I losing my mind
(Pour la dernière fois)
(Yeah)
Love song, love song
Don't try to tell me what your enemies taught you
I'm gone but I just want you to know
(Love song)
That this is not a love song that I want to sing1Embed
