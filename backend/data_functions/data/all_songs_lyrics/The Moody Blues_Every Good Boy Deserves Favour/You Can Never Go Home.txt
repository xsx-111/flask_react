You Can Never Go Home LyricsI don't know what I'm searching for
I never have opened the door
Tomorrow might find me at last
Turning my back on the past
But, time will tell, of stars that fell
A million years ago
Memories can never take you back, home, sweet home
You can never go home anymore
All my life I never really knew me till today
Now I know why, I'm just another step along the way
I lie awake for hours, I'm just waiting for the sun
When the journey we are making has begun
Don't deny the feeling that is stealing through your heart
Every happy ending needs to have a start
All my life I never really knew me till today
Now I know why, I'm just another step along the way
Weep no more for treasures you've been searching for in vain
'Cos the truth is gently falling with the rain
High above the forest lie the pastures of the sun
Where the two that learned the secret are now one
I don't know what I'm searching for
I never have opened the door
Tomorrow might find me at last
Turning my back on the past
But, time will tell, of stars that fell
A million years ago
Memories can never take you back, home, sweet home
You can never go home anymoreEmbed
