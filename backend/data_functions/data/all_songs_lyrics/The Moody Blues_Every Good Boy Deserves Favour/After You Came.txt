After You Came LyricsSince it began I've got one dream and really It's my only blessing
If I can come through then so can you
And you will find there's no regretting
Things that you want from your life's font
Will never let your spirit grow
Come back to earth for what it's worth
For you've been dreaming of the ceiling not a home
I've been doing my best
What else can I do?
Is there something I've missed
That will help me through
I've reached the top of my wall
I've found another way to fall
For some short time
For a while you and I were joined to eternity
Then we're split in two back to me and you
Like the rain rising from the sea
Rising from the sea
We all can see what we shall be
But knowing's really not controlling
With time perhaps I'll pass the traps and find some peace and understanding
After you've come and while you're gone
You leave me guessing - It's depressing
Never to know the way to go to find some time alone a little less pressing
So you just have to laugh
When it hurts so much
You're so far away and so hard to touch
I've reached the top of my wall
I've found another way to fall
Since it began I've got one dream and really It's my only blessing
If I can come through then so can you
And you will find there's no regretting
Things that you want from your life's font
Will never let your spirit grow
Come back to earth for what it's worth
For you've been dreaming of the ceiling not a home
I've been doing my best
What else can I do?
Is there something I've missed
That will help me through
I've reached the top of my wall
I've found another way to fallEmbed
