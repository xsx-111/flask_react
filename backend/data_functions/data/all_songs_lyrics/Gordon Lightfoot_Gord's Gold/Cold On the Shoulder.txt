Cold On the Shoulder Lyrics
All you need is time
All you need is time, time, time to make me bend
Give it a try, don't be rude
Put it to the test and I'll give it right back to you

It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day

Kick it around, take it to town
Try to defy what you feel inside
You better be strong
Your love belongs to us

It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day

All I need is trust
All I need is trust, trust, trust to make it show
I don't wanna know everything you done
If you get a tip then tell it to the Eskimos
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little, get a little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day

All we need is faith
All we need is faith, faith, faith to make it nice
Kick it around, don't be rude
If you're gonna make a mistake don't you make it twice

It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little, get a little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little older every day
It's cold on the shoulder
And you know that we get a little, get a little older every dayEmbed
