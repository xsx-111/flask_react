Cotton Jenny LyricsThere's a house on a hill
By a worn down, weathered old mill
In the valley below where the river winds
There's no such thing as bad times
And a soft southern flame
Oh, Cotton Jenny's her name
She wakes me up when the sun goes down
And the wheel of love goes 'round
Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round
Love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny
For Cotton Jenny to spend
But then
Wheels go 'round
When a new day begins
I go down to the cotton gin
And I make my time worthwhile to them
Then I climb back up again
Then she waits by the door
Oh Cotton Jenny, I'm sore
And she rubs my feet while the sun goes down
And the wheel of love goes 'round
Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round
Love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny
For Cotton Jenny to spend
But then
Wheels go 'round
In the hot, sickly south
When they say "well shut my mouth"
I can never be free from the cotton grind
But I know I've got what's mine
With a soft southern flame
Oh, Cotton Jenny's her name
She wakes me up when the sun goes down
And the wheel of love goes round
Wheels of love go 'round
Love go 'round
Love go 'round
A joyful sound
I ain't got a penny
For Cotton Jenny to spend
But then
Wheels go 'round
The wheel goes 'round
'Round and 'roundEmbed
