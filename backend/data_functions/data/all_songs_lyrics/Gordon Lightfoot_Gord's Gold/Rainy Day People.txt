Rainy Day People LyricsRainy day people
Always seem to know when it's time to call
Rainy day people don't talk
They just listen till they've heard it all
Rainy day lovers
Don't lie when they tell 'ya they've been down like you
Rainy day people
Don't mind if you cry a tear or two
If 'ya get lonely
All you really need is that rainy day love
Rainy day people
All know there's no sorrow they can't rise above
Rainy day lovers
Don't love any others
That would not be kind
Rainy day people
All know how it hangs on a piece of mind
Rainy day lovers
Don't lie when they tell you they've been down there too
Rainy day people
Don't mind if you cry a tear or two
Rainy day people
Always seem to know when you're feeling blue
High stepping strutters
Who land in the gutters sometimes need one too
Take it or leave it
Or try to believe it
If you've been down too long
Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside
They just pass it on
Rainy day lovers don't hide love inside
They just pass it onEmbed
