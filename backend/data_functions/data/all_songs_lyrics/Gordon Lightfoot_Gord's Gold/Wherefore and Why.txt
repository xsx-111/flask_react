Wherefore and Why Lyrics
When I awoke this mornin'
Something inside of me
Told me this would be my day
I heard the morning train
I felt the wind change
Too many times I'm on my way

Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand?
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain?

And then I saw the sunrise
Above a cotton sky
Like a candy cane delight
I saw the milkman
I saw the businessman
I saw the only road in sight

Then I got to thinkin'
What makes you want to go
To know the wherefore and the why?
So many times now
Oh Lord I can't remember
If it's September or July
Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand?
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain?

Then all at once it came to me
I saw the wherefore
And you can see it if you try
It's in the sun above
It's in the one you love
You'll never know the reason why

Come on sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand?
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain?
So much to lose, so much to gainEmbed
