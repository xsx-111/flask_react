Beautiful LyricsAt times I just don't know
How you could be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me
And I know that I won't ever change
'Cause we've been friends
Through rain or shine
For such a long, long time
Laughing eyes and smiling face
It seems so lucky just to have the right
Of telling you with all my might
You're beautiful tonight
And I know that you will never stray
'Cause you've been that way
From day to day
For such a long, long time
And when you hold me tight
How could life be anything but beautiful
I think that I was made for you
And you were made for me
And I know that I won't ever change
'Cause we've been friends
Through rain or shine
For such a long, long time
And I must say it means so much to me
To be the one who's telling you
I'm telling you
That you're beautifulEmbed
