Dressed Like Rappers Lyrics
My nigga, made sure you were living for real
How could you ever bring a pill pack
Control the speed
I won't let you go, no
My nigga, made sure you were living for real
How could you ever bring a pill pack

I control the speed
And I won't let you go
No, no way
You're everything I love
Hoes and weed
And I could testify
'Cause, who's ashamed?
So I might testify

I got a face that only your bitch could love
Your type niggas don't mix with us
Ain't this special like just because
Backpack full of that wrist and lung
Boarding pass, pass my troubles
High as fuck, lost my wallet
Going back, back to Cali
Saw my son, miss my daughter
Real lifeâ€”what does it feel like?
I got my pills on, you know I'm real numb
Gettin' ready for this motherfucker
I control the speed
And I won't let you go
No, away
You're everything I love
Hoes and weed
And I could testify
'Cause, who's ashamed?
So I might testify

I can admit, I've been depressed, I hit a wall, ouch
I hit the bank, you hit the dab, I hit the ball, out
Praying, God, pay my cable
Splurging out, one more favor
Little boys dressed like rappers
Can that road make them daddies?
I talked to God, I got approved, I got a lifeline
If I should die while I'm away I had a nice time

I control the speed
And I won't let you go
No, away
You're everything I love
Everything I love
How could you ever say no?
Dawg, I just looked at your Wikipedia, bro, and it's some information... You know, you see some information you already know? But you look at it more 'cause it's right in your face again? Bro... You was born in 1991, my nigga! That's weird, dog! It's creepy man. You was born in 1991, dog. You talk about this nasty shit in your music, all this crazy shit in your music, all this life shit in your music, dog. Girls... Bro, the girls you meet, dog... They're like born in 1994, bro! That's creepy, dog! That's nasty, dog!5Embed
