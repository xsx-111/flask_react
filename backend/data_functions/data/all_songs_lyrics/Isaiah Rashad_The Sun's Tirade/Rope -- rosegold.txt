Rope // rosegold LyricsPart I: "Rope"

Let's testify
That this world has—
Ahem
Mm, yeah

When I'm sober, I might testify
That this world has fallen out of place
For the few that always touch the sky
I don't want spaceships
I miss my roses
And I won't call you
'Cause I'm too fake
Like nowadays, I barely might know myself

But thank God I found this rope
I, I love you
Ayy, I love you
I love you
Oh, I know myself
But thank God I found this rope
I, I love you
I love you
I love you
Then, my daddy called me yesterday
My daddy called me yesterday
And he cried and cried into my phone
Oh, how he cried and cried
'Bout that love, that kind that he forgot
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Says he left his family all alone
I don't know why I feel all in grey
And I know my heart ain't built to bleed
But I came back and forth
To chase my tracks and roll with
I ain't supposed to know here
Yeah, yeah

Some goal, a face so shy
A friend so cold
Oh-oh
Yeah, some goal, a place so high
And friends so cold

I love you
I love you
I love you
Part II: "rosegold"

Ayy, if it's a padded room, it's a padded room
(The fancy car that keeps me going)
Glad to have you back, my nig'
(I know it)
Yeah, I knew that
I knew you was gonna make it back to this roof
(Eyes, and they shine)
I knew your ass was gon' be back, nigga
(Like 1999—like 1999)
It's too crazy, yeah

Alright, scramble—for the ammo
Can we build? Can we chill?
Can I live? With my kids?
Deuce—poof
Proof—Lord, I— I can't feel the joy
I—I can't fill the void, let—
Let 'em fill the void, too—
Too young to ignore (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But really—if we don't make it out the city
If we don't make it to the finish line
If I don't make it to your titties
I got the music for the vibers
I got the music for the vibers, ugh
And we don't usually talk about it, it's
Like you debatin' with a bible, mm
I'm really preachin' to the choir, ugh
I brought the music for the vibers, though
And in the chalice
That keeps me low as your morale is, ugh
And he just smoking on the cabbage
I see you fucking with the gravity
I been waiting for a challenge, ugh
Besides waiting for the balance
And the apricot
And I rap with Dot, and I laugh a lot
I got some old hoes (Ah-ha)
And some new friends (Ooh-ooh)
And some rose gold (Ah-ha)
And some, and some
And some rose gold, yeah
You are the fancy car that keeps me going
(I know you hear me talking to you, nigga)
I know ya (I know you can hear me nigga)
(Alright)
You are the fancy car that keeps me going (Whatever the fuck)
I know ya (South! Hahaha)
(Jesus, niggas be floating around in this bitch)
I got my eyes on ya
I got my eyes and they shine (Cuh, don't act like ...)
Like 1999 and cheap wine
(Don't act like you don't fucking hear me talking, like, to you)
I got my eyes on ya
I got my eyes and they shine
Like 1999 (You know, you ignoring the mirror so long, my nigga)
Like 1999

Only so fuckin' long you can ignore me, my nigga, don't—
Fucking—You—
Rashad—You fucking hear me, dog
Don't fucking—Dog
