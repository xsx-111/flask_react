4r da Squaw Lyrics
Beat tight as fuck
Turn up! Turn the light off
Des, turn it down
Ayy, you roll up? You’ll roll up for the boys?
For the Squad?
Nah, that’s Ty job right now
Ahem! Ah-hahahaha
Ayy, check me out
Yeah

If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm coming over
Found a message in my bottle, your son is coming up
"By the beer, by ear, by boo"—what Yari saying?
You ain’t nothin' but a baby, your fear is growing up
Listen here, I say, my dude, and what you call it
It was Heaven at the bottom and peace from throwing up
"By the beer, by ear, by boo"—my Yari saying
You ain't nothin' but a baby, your fear is growing up

I think I do this shit for real, dawg, hey
I ain't no motherfucking maybe
I'm for motherfucking real, dawg, hey
Mama, mama
I got some dollars for your bills, dawg, hey (Bills, dawg)
Now I'm the heading, I'm the topic
All that matters, I'm Jaleel, dog, hey
Yeah, you know, I think the sunshine
Should feel how I feel, how I feel, like, yeah
I think at nighttime
The moon should call my phone
Hit my line, I'm here for you
And Eastside, shame on us
Rain, come on now
I figured the mood
I figure, I figure
When I pay my bills, I'm good, I'm coming over
Found a message in my bottle, your son is coming up
"By the beer, by ear, by boo"—what Yari saying?
You ain't nothing but a baby, your fear is growing up
Listen here, I say, my dude, and what you call it
It was Heaven at the bottom and peace from throwing up
"By the beer, by ear, by boo"—my Yari saying
You ain't nothing but a baby, your fear is growing up

I got a dollar and a (Ooh), stop in Kansas (Ooh)
Toto to do or do not, do not forget me
I been wilding, Santa, pop-and-rock 'em
Lord, forgive 'em for the talcum powder
Alright, now stretch it (Oh), bless it (Ooh)
Bless it, my brother and his record
On the record, for the record, hey
And play it back 'cause they respect us
Alright, now I got ... the moon and the stars
Below my feet, so low I speak
So I don't wake them, praise the Lord that got in me
Who made me spoiled with rotten teeth
So I perform the prophecy
And on the norm, the plot could be
To be expressing who we are
And addressin' who they aren't
And doin' what they can't and want
If I can pay my bills, I'm good, I'm coming over
Found a message in my bottle, your son is coming up
"By the beer, by ear, by boo"—what Yari saying?
You ain't nothing but a baby, your fear is growing up
Listen here, I say, my dude, and what you call it
It was Heaven at the bottom and peace from throwing up
"By the beer, by ear, by boo"—my Yari saying
You ain't nothing but a baby, your fear is growing up

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!61Embed
