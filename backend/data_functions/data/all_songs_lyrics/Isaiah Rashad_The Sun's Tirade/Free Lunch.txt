Free Lunch Lyrics
Know it, scrub!
Scrub! Hahaha
Meal, meal
Ugh

Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, ugh
Steel in my liver, real niggas in my condom, huh
Phil hit me back, filled this one with a powder pack
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in California

The blow is good, the hoe is good
The show is good, you know it, scrub
Cool as me out front that Kanku's store
Kinfolk, you know it's love
Clean as Tide, Aveeno, Head & Shoulders
Hoe, you know it, scrub
Shoutout to my kinfolk, just got on that Coca-Cola, scrub
Watch my pole vault and my go-kart, this my getaway as fuck
In my hood we call it buck, fuck 'bout what you think of me
All my hoes be nines and dimes, all she want is chicken grease
All you know is what your mammy taught you 'bout the service
Get your ...
Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, ugh (Yeah)
Steel in my liver, real niggas in my condom, huh (Yeah)
Phil hit me back, filled this one with a powder pack
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in California
Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, come up, ugh (Yeah)
Steel in my liver, real niggas in my condom, huh
Phil hit me back, filled this one with a powder pack
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in California

Yeah, the trunk was full, the ride was long
The cop was cool, we smoked in peace
Ain't we them to move an ATM, might buy the atrium
Where you, Zay? Highway 58, at my cousin house
Nowadays, I like to bring my nephews and my budget out
I come from where you can't suck my dick
And leave my cousin out
In my hood we call it clout, fuck 'bout what you think of me
All my hoes be nines and dimes, all she want is chicken grease
All you know is what your mammy taught you 'bout the service
Get your...

Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, ugh (Yeah)
Steel in my liver, real niggas in my condom, huh (Yeah)
Phil hit me back, filled this one with a powder pack (Yeah)
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in California
Meal ticket, ticket, meal ticket, ticket, comma, ugh
Steel in my liver, real niggas in my condom, huh
Phil hit me back, filled this one with a powder pack (Hello?)
Pill bring me back, feel this one out in California (Yeah)
Today was a keeper, uh
I lost my heroes (Burn you out and fade away)
Long time ago, time ago (Burn you out and fade away, way)
Way, way
They gon' bring you down and burn you out and fade away, way
They gon' bring you down and burn you out and fade away, way
They gon' bring you down and burn you out and fade away, way
Way, way
They gon' bring you down and burn you out and fade away, way43Embed
