Brenda Lyrics
Ugh, um, yeah, uh-huh
Um, yeah, um, this a room

I got two cigarettes to my last name
I clock in for the check but I don't wanna go
(Yeah, yeah)
I got two cigarettes to my last name
I clock in for the check but I don't wanna go
She said, "You
You can't save 'em all"
She said, "You" (You, you, you)
"You can't save 'em all"
She said, "You" (You, you, you)
"You can't save 'em all" (You)
Yeah, look (You, ooh)

I mix a gallon of the gallon in a gallon of that
And down that in your Nissan for the memory
For the energy (Ayy), for the Tennessee
Fam call work, off work, just to visit me
I bought an ounce just to fuck with you (Ooh)
He don't take no handouts, he don't take no handouts
Remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my poppa told me—
"Trust inward"—trust in you, my N-word, my friend of
Last of the divine livin', so timid, all on us, doggone it
They would laugh at the small moments, then call on us, but
Like, who had you on your bad days? Huh
Who dropped you at that bitch house?
Like, like, back when we was little
I was just an instrumental
Now I'm Malcolm in a million
We talked about a billion, we talked about our feelings
We kept it more than realest
And look at how the path can, took it for the rap fam
Would you give your all to the world, the word, word, and left hurt?
Shit, and what's worse
She too tired to talk lately, your thumbs hurt
We miss love and sex, Bridget, your son's birth
Twenty-one hurts, in court by 24, boy (Killer)
"You can't save 'em all" (Nigga, ooh)
She said, "You" (You, you, you)
"You can't save 'em all"
She said, "You, you" (You, you, you)
"You, you can't save 'em all" (Oh, ah, yeah, yeah)
She said, "You" (You, you, you)
"You can't save 'em all"
Yeah, look

Alright, piss-test living, fuck that shit
Fuck— Fuck call centers
Fuck, is this really growing up, my nigga?
Tax on your motherfucking nuts, my nigga
$10.25—what the fuck can a nigga do with $10.25?
Plus your weed habit, plus my weed habit, and your weed habit?
For free giving, we living with a weed daddy
Two kids; mix that Boosie with that boom-bap
You rap like you need money, like you don't love this
My shit shoot up your jury before you judge this
Pull out, lick on my dick, it like, "Ain't it gorgeous?"
For those that can't afford this
It be like, "I got, I got
I got my own world
I got my own mind," daydreaming for a lunch break
For my son's sake, on the run for the funds' sake
I clock in for the check, but I don't wanna go, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It ain't that hard, I got two cigarettes to my last name
I clock in for the check, but I don't wanna go
Yeah (And it ain't that hard, I got)
"You
You can't save em all" (You, ooh, ooh)6Embed
