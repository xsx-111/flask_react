Tity and Dolla Lyrics
Yeah
This Sqad Up shit, yeah
Don't hit my phone when I'm tryna rap
This nigga Hugh in this motherfucker
This nigga Rock in this motherfucker
This nigga Dave Free
This nigga Chris Calor
Ugh, yeah

I'm just one dirty motherfucker
Hurt myself way more than you (Yeah)
This too much out here for the cup
I put that codeine in my soup (Yeah)
Used to spit in granny face
I'm supposed to show you love
I don't need no picket line
And I don't need no fucking hug (Right-right)
You just rapping just because (Right-right)
With your napkin full of drugs (Right-right)
Too exclusive in the back
Shit, we sneak 'em in the club (Right-right)
Who is that nigga if I ain't that nigga?
It ain't been popping if I ain't with Robert
Gotta consider my liver, my nigga
Gotta get rid of my kidney, my nigga (My nigga)
That was the only thing holding me back
None of these niggas ain't tellin' me shit
Lately, I only been bumping that Yachty
All this Burberry on top of my body
I know Lil Sunny with Kim in that 'Rari
You pulling up, tryna tell me the truth
I hit you back, like, "Lil nigga, revise it"
Look what I got; bitch, it's tity and dollar
Tell 'em back-back and just check out the power
Sweet line I used to walk, we used to want
Just wanna be like one of them
But now I don't, I ran away
I ran away, I ran away

I know that bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes (Yeah)
Just call before you come, just call before you go (Yeah)
Bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes
Just call before you come, just call before you...
I know bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes
Just call before you ... (Yeah), just call before you come
I know bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes
Just call before you..., just call before you come, bitch!
I be on my, I be on my

I be on my own shit, what's the motion?
Condoms, weed, and lotion (Lotion), wavy like the ocean (Ocean)
I got no emotions (No emotions), dolo in the function (Function)
You ain't in my section, you can't tell me nothin' (Ugh)
She just wanna sip on the real pink soda
Ride with a big billed .40
Slide through the hood, I know it's all good
I ain't from the set but I still got soldiers (Uh-huh)
Seven when I roll the dice, Henny straight, hold the ice
Lately, I don't take advice
Play me, won't live for twice, send you to a poltergeist
Treat the beat like I planned a heist (Ugh)
I know bitches just wanna be hoes (Be hoes)
Know hoes just wanna love me (Love me)
Know she wanna get cuddly
Sipping bubbly with an OG smokin' OG (OG)
I know bitches just wanna be hoes
Know hoes just wanna love me (That's she wanna do)
Know she wanna get cuddly (That's what she came to do)
Sipping bubbly with an OG smokin' OG (Yeah)
Sweet line I used to walk, we used to want
Just wanna be like one of them
But now, I don't, I ran away
I ran away, I ran away (Yeah...)

I know that bitches gon' be with it, but I love them hoes (Yeah)
Just call before you come, just call before you go (Yeah)
Bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes
Just call it before you come, just call before you ...
I know bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes
Just call before you ... (Yeah, wow), just call before you come
I know bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes
Just call before you ..., just call before you come, bitch!
I be on my, I be on my

I peep, I know, I know why
Hoes ain't fuck with your boy
Now, they wanna say "Hi" when I go by
Game sicker than ebola
Bitch, know when to roll up when I load my four-five
Sheesh, fine lines I cross
Between pimp shit and trying to enjoy this life
Yeah, bitch, I enjoy this life
You get whatever you wish long as your coin is right, right?
Wake up to the real tamale
So ill, might kill somebody just for GP
Be me with a white bitch
Waiting 'round the corner in a Mustang GT
I ain't talking bout much
Nothing but fucking and counting a few bucks
I'm all that shit you talk
My crystal ball show your future when I cruise up
Now, listen: All I want is gravy for my steak, bitch
I'm gon' grind for this weight
That mean I gots no time to wait, bitch
'Fore you fry my chicken, scrape that resin off that plate, bitch
No cut, no chase, I'ma do my place, so cut that fake shit
That's fake shit, biiiiitch
Sweet line I used to walk, we used to want
Just wanna be like one of them
But now, I don't, I ran away
I ran away, I ran away (Yeah...)

I know that bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes (Yeah)
Just call before you come, just call before you go (Yeah)
Bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes (Yeah)
Just call before you come, just call before you ...
I know bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes
Just call before you ... (Yeah, wow), just call before you come
I know bitches gon' be bitches, but I love them hoes
Just call before you ..., just call before you come, bitch!
I be on my, I be on my20Embed
