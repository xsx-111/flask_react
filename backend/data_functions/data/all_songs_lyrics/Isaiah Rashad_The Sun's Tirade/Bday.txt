Bday Lyrics
Dum, dum-dum-dum-dum-dum
Yeah
Feel me
You, ugh-ugh, ugh

Me, I feel great today
I can't help but just pour my drink
'Cause it be talkin' to a nigga
And ... Sometimes, I be talking back
Sometimes, I be, hahaha
Ah, just wait
Ugh

Play me, nigga, I'm faded
Nigga, I feel like 25 babies
Skunk, drunk, lookin' like a robber
Headed to the church or headed to the brothel
Pop my collar, really like Bieber
How you tell the truth to a crowd of white people?
Made it, motivational speaker, pumping
Most time, tellin' my teacher something

Baby, we was like Decatur
We was like Lithonia, elevated thinker, pumping
Deacon, stuntin' was a habit
Trappin' was a hobby, shooter got a reason
Thumper, Sasha, why you gotta leave me?
We was like forever, life is so confusing, fuck it
Take me, take me to revival
Maybe this'll help me, maybe this'll change my mind, yeah
(Ugh!) Ooh, believe I feel great today
I might just pour my drank, yeah
'Cause sometimes, it be talking to a nigga, yeah
And sometimes, I be talking back, yeah
Sometimes I be (Talking back)
Ugh, ugh, yeah

House-side niggas always stuffing a few
Southside niggas always keeping it there
Four-five trigger gave 'em something to do
Ugh, we should've shot at the moon
House-side niggas always stuffing a few
Southside niggas always keeping it there
Four-five trigger gave 'em something to do (Yeah, yeah)
We shoulda shot at the moon (Yeah, yeah)

Jesus always told me I was special
Muhammad told me go and get some money
Spread this shit to the world
'Cause ain't no fun if the homies can't ...
Have some, have mine, nigga, heaven ain't free
We was just praying for another drink
Bitch look good to a buzzard, hey
I could barely hear from the thunder, wait
I could barely feel from the money, wait
Baby, we was like Decatur
We was like Lithonia, elevated thinking, pumping
Deacon, stuntin' was a habit
Trappin' was a hobby, shooter got a reason
Thumper, Sasha, why you gotta leave me?
We was like forever, life is so confusing, fuck it
Take me, take me to revival
Maybe this'll help me, maybe this'll ease my mind, ugh

(Ugh!) Ooh, believe I feel great today
I might just pour my drink, yeah (Hahaha)
'Cause ... Sometimes it be talking to a nigga, yeah
And sometimes, I be talking back
Sometimes, I be
Hahaha, uhhhhh

House-side niggas always stuffing a few
Southside niggas always keeping it there
Four-five trigger gave 'em something to do
Yeah, we should've shot at the moon
House-side niggas always stuffing a few
Southside niggas always keeping it there
Four-five trigger gave 'em something to do
Yeah, we shoulda shot at the moon
Riding down the street with the hazard lights on
Turn my phone off while I'm switching time zones
Lost in the sauce, not sure where I stand
You can call me back if you can't pay me in advance
Riding down the street with the hazard lights on
Turn my phone off while I'm switching time zones
Lost in the sauce, not sure where I stand
You can call me back if you can't pay me in advance4Embed
