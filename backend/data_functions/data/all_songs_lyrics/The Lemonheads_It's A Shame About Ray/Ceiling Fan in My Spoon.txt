Ceiling Fan in My Spoon LyricsStarted out today jello in the sand
Went out of my way not to understand
Walked into a tree don't you look at me
See I'm not myself phoney mystery
Sore afraid
That's my tune
Ceiling fan in my spoon
Clothed in iron there's no denyin'
When you feel like a bent fork tine
Feelin' like a bent fork tine
Clothed in iron there's no denyin'
Sore afraid
That's my tune
Ceiling fan in my spoon
Started out today jello in the sand
Went out of my way not to understand
Walked into a tree don't you look at me
See I'm not myself phoney mystery
Sore afraid
That's my tune
Ceiling fan in my spoon
In my spoon...Embed
