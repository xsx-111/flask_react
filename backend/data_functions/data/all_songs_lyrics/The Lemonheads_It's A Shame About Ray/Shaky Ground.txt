Shaky Ground LyricsHey Jem, how ya doing, do you need someone else?
Well actually Jemima I'd prefer to be by myself
Always helps to have someone else along
But if my girlfriend sees us, she'll come to the conclusion it's wrong
Does this mean we're on shaky ground?
I'm happy when you're around
So let's not put our friendship at bay
I love you in a different way
Paradise and catastrophe, they go side by side
You should tell your baby, we've got nothing to hide
When I wanna see you I take Jersey for a walk
What's with all this secrecy, when all we ever do is talk?
Does this mean we're on shaky ground?
I'm happy when you're around
So let's not put our feelings at bay
I love you in a different way
Did you know we're on shaky ground?
I'm happy when you're around
So let's not put our friendship at bay baby bay baby bay baby bay
You hurt me real badEmbed
