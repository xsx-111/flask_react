Rockin Stroll LyricsShe takes me on a rocking stroll
If you won't wave guess I won't know
As by I roll I hope you'll throw a smile at me
'cause this here pram is all I've known
I won't be walking till I've grown
All I've been shown is everything I want to see
People's knees and trunks of trees smile at me
Looking upward to the sky, moving forward all the time
The sidewalk lines, gadunk-gadunk-gadunk-gdai
If it's warm in here is it cold down there?
Around out where I can only stare
I'm still aware of little but I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try
I'm gonna try. oh!
She takes me on a rocking stroll
If you won't wave guess I won't know
As by I roll I hope you'll throw a smile at me
'cause this here pram is all I've known
I won't be walking till I've grown
All I've been shown is everything I want to see
People's knees and trunks of trees smile at meEmbed
