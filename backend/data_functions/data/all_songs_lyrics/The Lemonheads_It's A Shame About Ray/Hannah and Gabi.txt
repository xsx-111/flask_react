Hannah and Gabi LyricsGot me watching your eyes watching things go by outside
Out the window of a train
Easy sipping them just seeing it fly left to right
Pour the milk and Ill say when
Im out wandering around
Youre but one thing Ive found
I dont mean to bring you down
Im out wandering around
Kinda hoped you wouldn't blame me
I can't wake up every day and find the same me
You can scream but Ill just dream how you might disappear
All I know is its never clear
I can't hold you near
You just are not here
Though it wasn't hard or far
I walked you to your car
Oh....Embed
