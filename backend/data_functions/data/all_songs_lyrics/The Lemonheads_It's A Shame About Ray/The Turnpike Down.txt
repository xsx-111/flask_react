The Turnpike Down LyricsI'm lost in the see-through
Pane always needs a bath
Between a want and a need to
Butterscotch streetlamps mark my path
{Play verse chords}
My country was of thee
Now why'd you have to leave
How'd this come to have to pass
Butterscotch streetlamps mark my path
Mark my path, mark my path down
Mark my path, mark my path down
Mark my path, mark my path down
Mark my path, mark my path down
I'm lost in the see-through
Pane always wants a wash
Between a want and a need to
Butterscotch streetlamps mark my path
Mark my path, mark my path down
Mark my path, mark my path downEmbed
