Kitchen LyricsThrilled to be in the same post code as you
I tell you things I know you'd like to know
Treat you to cake every night
Suddenly talk and it'll make you fright
Smile at me, I'll hold you really tight
Follow you into bed, run around till mornin'
We'll stay awake all night
We'll repeat the same stories
But of course never in front of friends
How it all started in the kitchen
Hey!
{play verse chords}
Remember the time you said we should wait awhile?
You'd let me know when you changed your mind
Yeah, I was sad for some time
But 12 hours watching me at the wheel
Made me realize what you really feel
Won't have to hurt anymore
Ooohhh......
Walking you home along Mt. Vernon Street
You told me secrets I was shocked to know
Pretend it was me every night
I'm thrilled to be in the same postcode as you
I'll come and visit, maybe never go
Follow you into bed
Run around till mornin' and we'll stay awake every night
We repeat the same stories
But of course never in front of friends
How it all started in the kitchen
