My Drug Buddy (demo) LyricsShe's coming over
We'll go out walking
Make a call on the way
She's in the phone booth now
I'm looking in
There comes a smile on her face
There's still some of the same stuff we got yesterday
There's still some of the same stuff we got yesterday
Yeah
I'm too much with myself
I wanna be someone else
I'm too much with myself
I wanna be someone else
I'm too much with myself
I wanna be someone else
So we take off out Fiona's door
Walk until it's light outside
Like before when we were on the phone
We have to laugh to look at each other
We have to laugh 'cause we're not alone
As the cars fly up King St
It's enough to startle us
It's enough to startle us
I love my drug buddy
My drug, my drug buddy
I love my drug buddy
My drug, my drug buddyEmbed
