Rudderless (demo) LyricsWaiting for some thin' to break
Left my heart out to bake
Nothing there in my glass
Wasn't air meant to last
Hope in my past
Hope in my past
Hope in my past
{Play verse chords}
All the way down to the lake
(Found the lake was wet)
How much more could I take
(Better yet)
Walked back home to my place
(Tired of getting high)
Guess I don't wanna die
Hope in my past
Hope in my past
Hope in my past
Hope in my past
Hope in my past
Hope in my past
Waiting for some thin' to break
Left my heart out to bake
Slipped my mind that I could use my brain
I'll stay up all night and crash on the plane
Ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a
Ship without a rudder
Ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a
Ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a ship without a
Rudder's like a ship without a rudder's like a ship without a rudderEmbed
