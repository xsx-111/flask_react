Feeling$ Real LyricsFeelings real, no second chance
Feelings real, objects of interest
Feelings real, instant rush
Feelings real, intangible
They say we're not for real, we'll show them how we feel
Feelings real, can't believe we're the only ones who understand
Feelings real, we're not the only ones who ran from desire, separate desperations
They say we're not for real, we'll show them how we feel
Feelings real, we feel like killing someone
Feelings real, we feel like criminals
Feelings real, expect the absolute worst
Feelings real, feelings real
The world starts coming downEmbed
