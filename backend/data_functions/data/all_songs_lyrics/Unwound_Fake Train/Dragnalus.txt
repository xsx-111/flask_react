Dragnalus LyricsThis song
That song
Love song
Hate song - you're so bored with
My life
Your life
This life
Our lives - you're so bored with
Everything
Anything
Anywhere
Nowhere
You're bored
I don't feel strange
I don't feel anything
Yeah!
My town
Your town
Their town
Any town - you're so bored with
T.V
Radio

Bored
My life
Your life
This life
Our lives
You're bored
I don't feel strange
I don't feel anything
Don't know you
And I don't think I ever will
This boredom really sucks
We are never the same1Embed
