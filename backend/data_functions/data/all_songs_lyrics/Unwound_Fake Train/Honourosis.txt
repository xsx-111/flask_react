Honourosis LyricsToday's different
Different than before
I just tore out the page
From the age of the ruin
I can't honor you, too sick to follow through
I just wasted too much time
Insanity's not worth a dime
I can't honor you, too sick to follow through
I just wasted too much time
Vanity's not worth a dime
Look at me right now
Pity me, resolve
Pay for me, absolve
Look at me right now
Right now, right now
And all deceits not worth the fucked up mystery
I 'd follow you around but this time it's historyEmbed
