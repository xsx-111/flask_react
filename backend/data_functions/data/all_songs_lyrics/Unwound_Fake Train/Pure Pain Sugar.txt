Pure Pain Sugar LyricsAnother episode, a fool I know won't tell me her name
I look the same, I still don't talk that way so sweet and sick
You ask me why
I feel okay 
Another episode, we laugh we cry we'd almost rather die
The pain's too great, don't hesitate to taste your own
I feel okay 
You want to know how I'd feel today? 
Another episode, we'd bleed and smile and go the extra mile
No pain's too great to even think about
No pain's too sweet to rot your teeth
I feel okay Embed
