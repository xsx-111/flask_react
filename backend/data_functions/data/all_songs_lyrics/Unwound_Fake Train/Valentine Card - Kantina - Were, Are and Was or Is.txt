Valentine Card / Kantina / Were, Are and Was or Is Lyrics
I know, I know, I know you see stars in my eyes
My heart, my heart, my heart means the world to me
I can't, I can't, I can't seem to break it apart
Rolled ink, don't think I would ever send it to you
I know, I know, I know you didn't mean to be there
I know, I know, I know you didn't mean to go there
Just a chance, just a chance, we are trying so hard to be through
Valentine, valentine, valentine will you always be mine?
I know, I know, I know it seems so long ago
To be so stuck on a face that won't go away
I can't, I can't, I can't seem to wait for the day
I know, I know, I know it don't matter anyway
I know, I know, I know I want none to be here
I know, I know, I know I don't take her no where
There's a chance, just a chance, any chance you would let it be true
Valentine, valentine, valentine will you always be mine?
Valentine, valentine
Valentine, valentine

Resigned to sit behind the others
Smile, it's not so bad to be the only one
Wait, wait, wait, wait don't go!
Stay, please, stay, please!
Wait, wait, wait, wait don't go!
Stay, stay!
Until I find, until I find, until I find
Another one, another one
Resigned, the sunrise was a lie
Was a dream, it's too dark outside to be alive
Wait, wait, wait, wait don't go!
Stay, stay!
Wait, wait, wait, wait don't go!
Stay, stay!
Until I find, until I find, until I find
Another one, another one
Resigned to fade to what was joy is pain
It's not so bad to be the only one alive
