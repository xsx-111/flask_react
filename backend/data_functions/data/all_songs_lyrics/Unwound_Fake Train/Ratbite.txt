Ratbite LyricsI've been bit, now it's haunting me
I've been bit, feel my disease
If I go that's my decision
If I die that's life precision
I'm sorry, so sorry
Ratbite! 
Now I wait for another day to decide which way I die
Can you look in this rat's eyes and apologize
Ratbite! 
Should I regret what I've done?
Should I forget what I've become?
Would I turn around and face the rat?
So sorry for what I've done, so sorry for what I've become
So sorry for the bitten life, so sorry, I want to die
