Nervous Energy LyricsI'm sure of myself
So don't get distressed
I'm sure of myself
Put me to the test
I sit here waiting, trying to kill my day
It's you I'm shaking for, my nervous energy
Yeah! 
I'm sure of myself
Put me to the test
I'm sure of myself
I don't need to impress
I sit here waiting, trying to kill my day
It's you I'm shaking for, my nervous energy
Yeah! 
Sit here waiting 
I sit here waiting, trying to kill my day
It's you I'm shaking for, my nervous energyEmbed
