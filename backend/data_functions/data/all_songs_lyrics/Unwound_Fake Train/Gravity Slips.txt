Gravity Slips LyricsI'm not the only fool who sees the other day
I'm not the only tool that breathes lost gravity
Falling down the stairs, cannot breathe light air
Lack of oxygen, gravity nowhere
And now I fall down, where I don't know
It seems invisible, hell's no place to go
Ahhhhh!
And when I look around I might just see the face
That looks right down on me to mark the end of day
It always ends this way, it always ends this way
Cause it always ends this way, it always ends this way
Falling down the stairs, cannot breathe light air
Lack of oxygen, gravity nowhere1Embed
