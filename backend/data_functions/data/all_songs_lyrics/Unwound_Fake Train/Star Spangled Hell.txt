Star Spangled Hell LyricsYou might feel like ten feet tall
In reality, you're nothing at all
Go tell your mother I don't feel so well
Is of the essence in star spangled hell
Why, I, take control
In reality, nothing at all
Tell, I wanna tell, I don't feel so well
Is of the essence of star spangled hellEmbed
