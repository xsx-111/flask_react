Lucky Acid LyricsThis is the mystery, the final count me out
The end of misery and mind me no fallout
Death is of no concern, he's on an acid trip
This is the twenty-third, this is the lucky one
And why I kill myself and when I kill myself
Is not of relevance, because I will be gone
And it will never come and it will not work out
And it will never count and it will never count
This is the mystery, the final count me out
The end of misery and mind me no fallout
Death is of no concern, he's on an acid trip
This is the twenty-third, this is the lucky one
This is the lucky one Embed
