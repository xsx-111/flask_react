Suffer for Fashion Lyrics
We just want to emote till we're dead
I know we suffer for fashion or whatever
We don't want these days to ever end
We just want to emasculate them forever

Forever, forever
Oh, pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that
We've got to keep it physical

When our teles are six hours away
Please call to say that you miss me, feel me or whatever
Vicissitudes are boxing our heads
Like they just want to emaciate them forever

Forever, forever
Oh, pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that
We've got to keep our little clique clicking
At 130 b.p.m. it's not too slow
If we've got to burn out, let's do it together
Let's all melt down together
Together
Let's go together
Let's do it together
Let's go together

Forever, forever
Oh, pretty sirens don't go flat
It's not supposed to happen like that
Not like that
Not like that

We've got to keep our little clique clicking
At 130 b.p.m. it's not too slow
If we've got to burn out, let's do it together
Let's all melt down together
Together
Let's go together
Let's do it together
Let's go together2Embed
