Cato as a Pun LyricsCato, play with my head
I won't know the difference
If we're living in the novelist
Or statistician
Cato, mess with my concepts
My inner vision
Like a strobing light
Please confuse my every decision
I can't even pretend that you are my friend
What has happened to you and I?
And don't say that I have changed
'Cause man, of course I have
Are you far too depressed now
Even to answer the phone?
I guess you just want to
Shave your head, have a drink and be left alone
Is that too much to ask?3Embed
