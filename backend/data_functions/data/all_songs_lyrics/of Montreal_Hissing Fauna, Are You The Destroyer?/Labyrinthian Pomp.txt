Labyrinthian Pomp LyricsHow you wanna tag my style?
I am so superior
How you wanna hate a thing
When you are so inferior?
How you wanna mess...
How you wanna mess my spotless interior?
Oh, oh, let's just say
You are not the destroyer
Let's just say
Du er ikke den som ødelegger fitta
I got my bright girl near me
She's so much taller
With a crisp endorsement
From the C.C.A.A. Booty Patrol
She's so meta
Reference Stendhal
Shares my strange urge
To smash a window in every house on our block
Delinquent days are here again
How you wanna tag my style?
I am so superior
How you wanna hate a thing
When you are so inferior?
How you wanna mess...
How you wanna mess my spotless interior?
Oh, oh, let's just say
You are not the destroyer
Let's just say
Du er ikke den som ødelegger fitta
I got my Georgie Fruit on
He's a dark mutation
For my demented pastime
Giving replicators somewhere to go
But we're authentic
You can test my talons
Against your cursive body
The controller spheres have disappeared and it hurts
Delinquent days are here again
It's like to disappear forever
But I'm not afraid
There's two Gods for everyone
One, two Gods for the beasts
An hour dead
Deflects our eggs on latitude
0, 1 degree, I trusted you
No, don't explain
Moving in clipped tempos, making
Sad dreams of the flag appearing
Crazy how the symbolism works
Don't look at themEmbed
