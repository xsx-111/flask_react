Faberge Falls for Shuggie LyricsThose with the golden axe have tried to tell me
What they say?
Oh, that the bird in my chest was dead
But that's never, never, never
She ain't my thug no more, ain't no kind of killer
And she can break 'em off if she damn well please
Just as long as she brings it home to me
And it's still hot
Can you touch what I'm saying?
It's like, did Shuggie do it yet?
No, not yet, wait
Those with the golden axe have tried to tell me
Tell you what?
Oh, that the sex in my walk was cotton soft
But that's never, never, never
With question marks in my eyes
And your strange name pressed to our lips
We arrived at number eleven
So charged and ready for slavery
I won't take the stage straight, understand?
Under capes with druggy cock dragons
I wanna put out so bad
But something bad said, 'The kid's probably right.'
Are you deflating at the question?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, okay
Now that the parachute has opened, well
Don't it make you feel good?
Now that the parachute has opened, well
Don't it make you feel good?
Be careful how you touch me
My body is an earthquake
Ready to receive you
My mind's making glaciers
Metals for my soldiers
Let's be like strangers
Touching for the first time
Skeletal Lamping
The controller sphere
False priest
Skeletal lamping
The controller sphere
False priestEmbed
