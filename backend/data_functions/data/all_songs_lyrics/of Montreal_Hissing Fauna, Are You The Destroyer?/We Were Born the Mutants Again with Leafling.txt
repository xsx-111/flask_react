We Were Born the Mutants Again with Leafling LyricsShe says I'm boring her camera
It takes more to delight the cadaver
Night eyes on icy patrols
Yours were not so Nazi feline
Mine were as dead as monks
And our particles are in motion
Night eyes producing ashes
We love to view unfortunate passions
Still, she takes my photo to bed
No mere limp verse could incite
Identity destruction
Our particles are in motion
Sometimes, we're not legible
But we're the same strange animal
Let them say our love is peculiar, don't care
There's only now, no ever after
We won't let it end in disaster
You are my twin, no, I will never go there2Embed
