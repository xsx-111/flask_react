Turnstile Blues LyricsMy thoughts take me downtown
Change up at the turnstile
Go blind in the traffic
I go about it the wrong way, so what?
See both pennies landed
They jumped where the sky scrapes
One's heads, one's blind, I'm yours
And you're over, now change
Get caught on the weak end
You're gone, and now, we fade
Your mind makes me nervous
Your thoughts make me feel bad
It's alright
It's alright
(Shake, shake, shake, shake) Shake, shake the clouds out
(Shake, shake, shake, shake) Shake, shake the stars down
(Shake, shake, shake, shake) Shake, shake it downtown
I brace
Myself
To fall
In place
Over you
Over you
Over you
Over you
(Shake, shake, shake, shake) Shake, shake the clouds out
(Shake, shake, shake, shake) Shake, shake the stars down
(Shake, shake, shake, shake) Shake, shake it downtown
Now you can see yourself
Now you can see yourself
Now you can see yourself
Now you can see yourself
So what?
It's alright
So what?
It's alright2Embed
