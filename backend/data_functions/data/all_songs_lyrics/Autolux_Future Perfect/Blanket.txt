Blanket LyricsIf everything had come true
There'd be nothing left to do
Wander the halls
Meet outside ourselves
Ring up the nightwatch
To wake up the king's nurse
She could chase us through the kitchen
Asleep
Our lord is so neurotic
He's a hypochondriac
Our lord is so neurotic
He's a hypo
You know, lately, I've been worrying
That it might just be okay
You know, lately, I've been worrying
That it might just be okay
You know, lately, I've been worrying
You know, lately, I've been worrying
You know, lately, I've been worrying
You know, lately
I black out, just to keep it real
I black out, ain't no big deal
I black out, down into the sun
I black out, straitjacket fun
Dumb, just like a genius
Dumb, just like Jesus
Dumb, just like a knee jerk
Dumb, now you can kick it
I black out, just to keep it real
I black out, ain't no big deal
I black out, I black out, I black out
It ain't no big deal1Embed
