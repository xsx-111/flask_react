Subzero Fun LyricsYou're my preferred route down
Cocoon Similac frown
Forget what you lack
They still want you back
If you recognize me
Please just pass on by
Now it's every day
They're all in your way
Except for this one
You've got a rubber soul
You've got the rubber sight
Before it gets too medical
Just get yourself together
For some subzero fun
You're my best eraser
Days can't go much faster
You won't cross yourself
When you're someone else
So watch your head now
Watch your head
You've got a rubber soul
You've got the rubber sight
Before it gets too medical
Just get yourself together
For some subzero
Got a rubber soul
You've got the rubber sight
It's so environmental
Ice caps melt for you, babe
In this subzero funEmbed
