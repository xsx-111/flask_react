Capital Kind of Strain LyricsThey don't know, so don't trust them
Keep your eyes on the sidewalk
And kick them around for a few
Fake you out is all they'll do
Keep your head all tied up
In the sky above you
It's a capital kind of
It's a capital kind of
It's a capital kind of strain
They don't know how to waste time
Keep your eyes on the landmark
They'll be here soon to forget you
Fake you out is all they'll do
Keep your head all tied up
In the sky above you
It's a capital kind of
It's a capital kind of
It's a capital kind of strain
It's a capital kind of
It's a capital kind of
It's a capital kind of strainEmbed
