Angry Candy LyricsMy ticket
Exploded
When you showed
From nowhere
And left me
In static
Now, I just hang around
I got seizures
Uploaded
In life-size
And they’re gonna blow
Like see-through
Like stupid
Just like at home
So you
Missed the getaway, and you
Crashed the stolen plane
Now, everyone can say
"Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do"
Your keys are
Already
In Heaven
On radar
They’re restless
They’re waiting
For you to go
Let me go around
You're making me out
Let me go around
You're making me out
So you
Missed the getaway, and you
Crashed the stolen plane
Now, everyone can say
"Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do"
So you
Missed the getaway, and you
Crashed the stolen plane
Now, everyone can say
"Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do"
A hideout in the brush
To heal a broken mind
I heard the crooked words falling down
You missed the getaway
And crashed the stolen plane
Now, everyone can say
You
Missed the getaway, and you
Crashed the stolen plane
Now, everyone can say
"Do-do, do-do, do-do, do-do"Embed
