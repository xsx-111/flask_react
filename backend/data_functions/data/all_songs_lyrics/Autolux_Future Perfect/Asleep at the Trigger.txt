Asleep at the Trigger LyricsLook, you think I'm unglued
I'm just studying you
Fold up all over town
Stereo mindset sucking you down
You're dressed up, look what you've sewn
But left your insides at home
Hit me with your smile again
Hit me with your smile again
Disappear beneath the day
Oh no, it's still the same
You make it hard to breathe
You make it hard to breathe
You miss everything that's in your way
You miss everything that's good for you
It kinda gets me down
Kinda gets me down
It kinda gets me down
Look, you think I'm unglued
I'm still studying you
You fold up all over town
Stereo mindset sucking you downEmbed
