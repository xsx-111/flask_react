Sugarless LyricsShelling out what you need
There's no time for self-esteem
Take your carbon pill tonight
Have a seat for the fight
Way too late to come off smart
Leave your mask inside its box
Smile cold, anatomy
Teeth like stars, you start to freeze
You can't wake up
Never wake up, can't wake up
Seems to me like
There's really no reason
Impossible day
I don't complain
I'm over it, I guess
Scattered and grey, so
I hold it back
And keep it sugarless
Impossible day
I don't complain
I'm over it, I guess
Scattered and grey, so
I hold it back
And keep it sugarless
You just caved in
Yeah
It came from nowhere
You just caved in
Yeah
It came from nowhere
Impossible day
I don't complain
I'm over it, I guess
Scattered and grey, so
I hold it back
And keep it sugarless
Impossible day
I don't complain
I'm over it, I guess
Scattered and grey, so
I hold it back
And keep it sugarlessEmbed
