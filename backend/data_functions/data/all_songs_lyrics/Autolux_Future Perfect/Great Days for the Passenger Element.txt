Great Days for the Passenger Element LyricsEven without a face
I don't wanna talk about it
We could be replaced
Anytime
Flat duration soul
Just make believe excitement
Dead, but not so cold
All lazy pigs
What a way to go
Always that thing that happens
When everything's just so
You understand
We don't know what side we're on
Dreaming with our heads cut off
Half in love and underground
Most of you will not be found
Sickle raven sky
My thoughts are boomerangs
You know when you get high
It's all wrong
System's all awry
I get up to get arrested
Every single time
We don't know what side we're on
Dreaming with our heads cut off
Half in love and breaking down
Most of you will not be found by anyoneEmbed
