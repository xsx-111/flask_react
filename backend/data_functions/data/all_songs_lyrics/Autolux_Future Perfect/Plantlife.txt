Plantlife LyricsAll for one, growing
In you, growing
You can be afraid of it
Or callously go on
Bend to me, darling
You'll see, darling
It's a violent way we have
Even when we smile
We're so dumb someways
So dumb, always
Tied up and pulled apart
Like a kidnapped root
Kill your best ideas
Your crossed beliefs
Catch a glimpse of Natalie
In Catalina fog
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth
Shut your mouth3Embed
