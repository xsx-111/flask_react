Here Comes Everybody LyricsThey still look at you like a lost battalion
Calling on all downs that you once made home
My apologies to your lost battalion
They still look at you like your loss is so great
Let's go, let's go
Let's go
Soft, soft silver bang, like a bank's hydraulics
The air, it hangs its head, and your cat has passed out
You polished off your thoughts in the bank's hydraulics
Soft, soft silver bang when the vaults are all shut
(Let's go, let's go)
Down, so let down, down again
The doubt, it takes you down another step
Down, you feel so down that all you think
Here comes everybody from the outside
They all want the same things that you hate
Turn your face back on, crack a smile
Here comes everybody you never cared for
(Let's go, let's go)
Down, so let down, down again
The doubt, it takes you down another step
Your only alibi comes just like
Let's go, let's go
They won't be happy for you
(Let's go, let's go)
They won't be happy for you
(Let's go, let's go)
They won't be happy for you
(Let's go, let's go)
They won't be happy for you
(Let's go)Embed
