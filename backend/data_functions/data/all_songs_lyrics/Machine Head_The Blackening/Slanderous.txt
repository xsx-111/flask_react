Slanderous Lyrics
I'm wasted and ugly
I am the underbelly
A fat fuck and a fairy
The reject they wish to bury

They want to
Murder us, silence us
Divide and conquer us
As they lead, as we die
Let these three words decide

I love you!
Why do I hate my brother?
I hate you!
Or do I hate myself?

I'm a meth head and alkie
Dumb cunt been called a junkie
A retard and a pussy
And I embrace the names you call me

They want to
Murder us, silence us
Divide and conquer us
As they lead, as we die
Let these three words decide
I love you!
Why do I hate my brother?
I hate you!
Or do I hate myself?




I'm a redneck and a faggot
The asshole ignoramus
A wetback and a nigga
And I raise my middle fingers to those that

Murder us, silence us
Divide and conquer us
As they lead, as we die
Let these three words decide

I love you
Why do I hate my brother?
I hate you
I hate myself
Love!
Hate!
I love you!
Why do I hate my brother?
I hate you!
Or do I hate myself?1Embed
