A Farewell to Arms Lyrics
Can you hear their cries?
Nowhere can the children run to hide
Crimson rivers
Flow down hills
Atone our ills
And woe to all her songs of love

A farewell to arms

Mutilated lives
Blackening as coffin line the sides
Filled with fathers
Who has won?
When only sons
Hold their grieving heads and mourn

A farewell to arms

Always our souls entwine
Erase this vast divide
Deaf ears, our voices rest
Tyrant, this is protest
Who has won?
Yes, who has won?

I'll wave this flag of white
So the venged see the light
We'll pay for closed eyes
With our genocide

Piercing the masquerade
March to the death parade
Trade not humanity
For pearls of our slavery

In the depth of mind
The heart will find
The truth of our leader
We'll try the facts
So through the cracks
May fall the lying cheater

Who has won when
We're all dead?
I'll wave this flag of white
So the venged see the light
We'll pay for closed eyes
With our genocide

So is this how we live?
Or is this how we die?

Black blood dripping from platinum fangs
Rich blood flees while our poverty hangs

Shepherds they herd the mindless trance
As the flock follows the puppet's dance
In a fatal romance!


All that they needed was a pretext, war's next
Heads to the chopping blocks and our necks are next
For those who died, who fought for our rights
Whose children now slaves, they're turning in their graves
War hawks and senators, they sit tight, so trite
Never their sons will know what it's like to fight
Soldiers are dead, and children have bled
And the silence is numb, what have we become?

What have we become?!
What have we become?!
What have we become?!
God save us!
