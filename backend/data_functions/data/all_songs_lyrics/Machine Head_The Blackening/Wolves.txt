Wolves Lyrics
Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all


Look in the eyes of rage
A loyalty bred of suffering
The fire inside, it burns eternally, victory!
Look in the eyes of pain
The scars on our souls forever remain
Calling the sheltered of the broken wing, join the fray!

Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles
A family of the unwanted
Beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence
And to tyrants, bow to none

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all
Look in the eyes of hate
A circle of hell, they come to pray
United against all that come threatening, lay to waste!
Look in the eyes of the free
Bound to each other's longevity
Guarding the back of alpha's dignity, savagely!

Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles
A family of the unwanted
Beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence
And to tyrants, bow to none

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all

Come closer, walk with me in hell
Dear rival, fear in you I smell
A fist to face is all fair game now
The pack attacking, the sacrificial
Pray for the prayers
Reaping the sour seeds of death's bread
In teeth and claw, the scent of the dead

Come closer, walk with me in hell
Dear rival, fear in you I smell
A fist to face is all fair game now
The pack attacking, the sacrificial
Pray for the prayers

Spreading our population far across the land
Loving to fornicate, respecting the command
Rally the warriors and tally the score
In every victory is solace but there's

No satisfaction!
No satisfaction!
There is no satisfaction!
There is no satisfaction!
And there never will be!




Bury our rivals
Shotguns, knives, rifles
A family of the unwanted
Beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence
And to tyrants, bow to none
A family of the unwanted
Beaten, stunted, dysfunction
A brotherhood that is of violence
And to tyrants, bow to none

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules
Comparison, competition
We'll bury one and all

Unleash the wolves
Carnage has no rules now
The night will fall!
Beware the call!
Dominate all!1Embed
