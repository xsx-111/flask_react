Beautiful Mourning Lyrics
Fuck you all!

My redemption is knowing this will be over
My aggression, I fear I've lost control
Who is this man I stare?
Mirror reflects a stranger
Fist shatters the despair
Awake the pain to anger

How do I close thine eyes of murder?
How do I close thine eyes of murder
Staring into me?

My obsession is dying, sinking me deeper
My depression, this world has disavowed
Razor at wrist, I seethe
The flesh is peeled apart now
Gone is my faded dream
Failure, I welcome in thou

How do I close thine eyes of murder?
How do I close thine eyes of murder
Staring into me?
This lifetime in sorrow
God let the angels die
This is our last goodbye
In love and death we cry
Our last goodbye!


No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no!

Spit in the face of loss
Coward, my own self-hatred
No more I bear this cross
Suffer, and rise from the dead

This lifetime in sorrow
God let the angels die
This is our last goodbye
In love and death we cryEmbed
