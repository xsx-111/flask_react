Now I Lay Thee Down Lyrics
I want to know
How it feels
When we die
Can you take me under?

Dream over
Grieve no more
And breathe one last time
Now I lay thee down!

She watched me leave
Me bleeding
On the floor
As she takes me under

Dream over
Grieve no more
And breathe one last time
Now I lay thee down!

Godless mimicry
White lights, cemetery
Flashes of the angel's ivory wings
Images so many broken dreams
Of pain!
Terror!
Fear!
Crippling!
Follow the light into the tunnel
Or will it end up in a black hole?
Follow the light into the tunnel
Dead in its end
Was it love?
Was it murder?
Within the eyes of the beholder
Was it love? (was it love?)
Was it murder? (was it murder?)
Within the eyes of the beholder





What have I done?
I've gone and killed the only one I love
How could I do this?
I'm screaming at God
Why do you curse me?
Fuck it, load it, sever the day!

Dream over
Grieve no more
And breathe one last time
Now I lay thee
Now I lay thee down!
Underground!Embed
