Halo Lyrics
This is a call to arms, will you stand beside me?
This is our time to fight, no more compromising
And this blackened heart will sing
For sad solidarity

Halo over our demise
Following a God so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not the shit they feed

This is a right to life, not religious right's act
This is abortion's knife, aiming at the womb of
The Christian conspiracy
So open thine eyes and see

The halo over our demise
Following a God so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not the shit they feed

There's hate for...
Our time will come!
Our time will come!
Our time is now!
Our time is now!




And I won't pray for you
And I won't pray for you
And I won't pray for you

Halo!
Follow!
Sallow!
Swallow!
Halo over our demise
Following a God so blind
Sallow in their sickening
Swallow not the shit they feed
Shit they feed!
Your words will never hold us down
Prayers won't be spared on you
Satisfaction denied
'Til you're dead and gone!
Gone!
Dead and gone!
You're gone!
You're gone!Embed
