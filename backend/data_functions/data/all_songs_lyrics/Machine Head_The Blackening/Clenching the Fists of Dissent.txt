Clenching the Fists of Dissent Lyrics
Behold, I
Crawl!
War!

Do you hear revolution's call?
Time to fight our own denial
Warmongers keep us locked in fear
Invoke the past, a moment of tears
An ugly truth, put forth by our youth
Under the threat of patriotic brute
So use your rage!
It is a weapon, we now must engage
Let trumpets sound our call!
Or by their lies we will fall

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing!

Sing revolution's song (When they say die!)
Die for America!


War!

They say that freedom isn't free
It's paid with the lives of sons and families
'Cause blood is their new currency
And oil pumps the heart of money
So fight as one, without a fucking gun
Words are the bullets to this revolution
Use your pain!
The battlegrounds, the streets are ablaze
Excess will pave their path!
The winds of change, our bloodbath

Gnash down our teeth in hate and sing!

Sing revolution's song (When they say die!)
Die for America!
{Spoken lines that are too quiet to make out}
Today, we build this future

Power and prejudice
Actions they use to pit against
Terror, insurgency
Words uses to scare conformity
It's propaganda, it's their hypocrisy
Free to choose our own slavery
All suffer humanity
Fall!





Raise your hands
Raise your fists and...
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
So fight for all that you love
Scream, choking with foot upon throat
Blind, scar spangled eyes
Death, no more the truth you will hide
No, no!

So how do they sleep?
While our mothers weep
They're selling our souls
And our blood for oil

Our generation can be the fucking one
That overcomes the greed of corrupt nations
Have no shame!
You're not alone in thinking this is fucking insane
Rise up and take your stand!
And curl the fingers of your hand

And I don't know what to do
'Cause I don't have the answers
But with every ounce of strength
I'll vow to fight this cancer
Didn't say I want to lead
I just might let you down
Didn't say believe in me
Just hold this common ground
I'm just as lost as you
And probably more confused
So fucking far from perfect
My mind wrecked from abuse
There's something fucking wrong
When war takes sons and daughters
Our lambs misled to slaughter!

War!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Lies!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Fear!
Clenching the fists of dissent
Change!
Clenching to hope!Embed
