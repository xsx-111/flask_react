Bicycle LyricsI'm in love with you, little sister
We ride home in the night
While under our feet, the rain paints the street with the stars
Passing cars with light trails behind them
We could follow them on
Giving this town is wearing me down
Lets take off
No one would know that we've gone
(Aaaah, aaaah, Yeah)
(Aaaah, aaaah, Yeah)
(Aaaah)
I'm in love with you, little sister
We ride home in the night
While under our feet, the rain paints the street with the stars
Passing cars with light trails behind them
We could follow them on
Giving this town is wearing me down
Lets take off
No one would know that we've goneEmbed
