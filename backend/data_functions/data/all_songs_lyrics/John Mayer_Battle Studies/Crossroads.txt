Crossroads Lyrics
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord for mercy
Said, help me if you please
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
No one seemed to know me, everybody passed me by

You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
That I'm standing at the crossroads
I believe I'm sinking down1Embed
