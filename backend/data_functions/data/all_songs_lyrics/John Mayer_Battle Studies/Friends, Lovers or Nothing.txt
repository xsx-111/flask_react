Friends, Lovers or Nothing Lyrics
Now that we are over as the loving kind
We'll be dreaming ways to keep the good alive
Only when we want is not a compromise
I'd be pouring tears into your drying eyes

Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up

You whisper, come on over
Cause you're two drinks in
But in the morning, I will say goodbye again
Think we'll never fall into the jealous game
The streets are flood with blood of those who felt the same

Friends, lovers or nothing
There can only be one
Friends, lovers or nothing
There will never be an in-between, so give it up

Friends, lovers, or nothing
We can really only ever be one
Friends, lovers, or nothing
We'll never be the inbetween
So give it up
We'll never the inbetween
So give it up
Anything other than 'yes' is 'no'
Anything other than 'stay' is 'go'
Anything less than 'I love you' is lying...Embed
