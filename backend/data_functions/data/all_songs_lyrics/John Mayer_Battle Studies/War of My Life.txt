War of My Life Lyrics
Come out angels, come out ghosts
Come out darkness, bring everyone you know
I'm not running, and I'm not scared
I am waiting, and well prepared

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

I got a hammer, and a heart of glass
I got to know right now, which walls to smash
I got to pocket, got no pills
If fear hasn't killed me yet, then nothing will
All the suffering
And all the pain
Never left a name

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
No more suffering
No more pain
Never again

I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run
I'm in the war of my life
At the door of my life
Out of time, and there's nowhere to run

So fight on (I won't give up)
Fight on, everyone (I won't run)
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done (I won't stop for anyone)
So fight on
So fight on (I won't give up)
Fight on, everyone (I won't run)
Fight on, got no choice but to fight until it's done (I won't stop for anyone)
So fight onEmbed
