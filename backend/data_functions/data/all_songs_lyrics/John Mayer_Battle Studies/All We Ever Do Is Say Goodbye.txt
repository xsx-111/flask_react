All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye Lyrics
Just when I had you off my head
Your voice comes thrashing wildly through my quiet bed
You say you want to try again
But I've tried everything but giving in

Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when

All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

I bought a ticket on a plane
And by the time it landed, you were gone again
I love you more than songs can say
But I can't keep running after yesterday, so

Why do you want to break my heart again?
Why am I going to let you try when
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye

We say goodbye
We say goodbye
We say goodbye

All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye
All we ever do is say goodbye2Embed
