Pack of Thieves Lyrics
Here, behind those eyes
There is something you should know
Here, behind those eyes
There is something you should know

Oh, change cannot be subject
To conditional falls
'Cause we're squatting in a system
That consistently stalls
Don't be fooled into thinking
That a small group of friends
Cannot change the world

That's the only thing that ever has
(The only thing that ever has)
The only thing that ever has
Stand up!
Stand up!
That's the only thing that ever has
(The only thing that ever has)
The only thing that ever has
Stand up!
Stand up!
Here, behind those eyes
There is something you should know

Oh, behind those eyes
We reach through their callous disguise
Into fortresses where they fabricate
Whitewash and lies
We're all fooled into living
With a small pack of thieves
That distort the world

That's what this antique structure creates
(This antique structure will create)
What this antique structure creates
Stand up!
Stand up!
That's what this antique structure creates
(This antique structure will create)
What this antique structure creates
Stand up!
Stand up!
Here, behind those eyes
There is something you should know

We are all connected
We are all connected here
Now change the world

We blast behind those eyes
Smash through to the cortex
Gut wrenching business (Caught off guard!)
Not psyched for the vortex
This can't be real!
Ahh!

Here, behind those eyes
There is something you should know
Hid behind those eyes
There is something you should know

Don't be fooled into thinking
That a small group of friends
Cannot change the world1Embed
