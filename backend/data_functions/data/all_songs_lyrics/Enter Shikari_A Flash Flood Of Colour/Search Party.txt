Search Party Lyrics
I know that we're gonna repeat history
Unless we sort this out
I know that we've gotta find something new
Something new

Now my crew is six thousand million strong
But we're not learning from
A history of conflict and violence
For ownership and the power to silence

I know (That we've gotta find something new)
Whoa, whoa
I know (That we've gotta find something new)
Whoa, whoa

Retracing all our steps
We send out the set back search party
To locate the barriers that lock us down
The ph√©nakisticope is spinning
Flashbacks to your beginnings
The repetition that you felt you found
Now my crew is six thousand million strong
But we're not learning from
A history of conflict and violence
For ownership and the power to silence

I know (That we've gotta find something new)
Whoa, whoa
I know (That we've gotta find something new)
Whoa, whoa

I know that we're gonna repeat history
Unless we sort this out
I know that we've gotta find something new
Something new

All hands on deck
We've got to scrub these fuckers out
All hands on deck

I know (That we've gotta find something new)
Whoa, whoa
I know (That we've gotta find something new)
Whoa, whoa
I know (That we've gotta find something new)
Whoa, whoa
I know (That we've gotta find something new)
Whoa, whoa

I know that we're gonna repeat history
Unless we sort this out
I know that we're gonna find something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something newEmbed
