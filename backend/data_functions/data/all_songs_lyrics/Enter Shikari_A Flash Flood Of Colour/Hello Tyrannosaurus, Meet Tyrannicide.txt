Hello Tyrannosaurus, Meet Tyrannicide Lyrics
'Ello, tyrannosaurus, meet tyrannicide
You haven't read your history, have you? Just regurgitated lies
And everything taught to you, no man is too tall
You can grow but remember, empires always fall

We're not your subjects, you're not our king
Nature is the only dictator that I respect and obey
You don't invent, you don't create
Now's our chance to eradicate

'Ello, tyrannosaurus, meet tyrannicide
You haven't read your history, have you? Just regurgitated lies
And everything taught to you, that no man is too tall
You can grow but remember, empires always fall

We're not your subjects, you're not our king
Nature is the only dictator that I respect and obey
You don't invent, you don't create
Now's our chance to eradicate

We will torture, we will slaughter in your name
We will occupy and we will invade
We will silence and suppress without blame
We will rape, steal, destroy all you made
'Ello, tyrannosaurus, meet tyrannicide
You haven't read your history, have you? Just regurgitated lies
And everything taught to you, that no man is too tall
You can grow but remember, empires always fall
Empires always fall
Always fall
Empires always fall
Always fall

Concrete eye contact
Dig your nails into your palms
'Ello, Tyrannosaurus!

Empires always fall
Empires always (Fall!)
Empires always (Fall!)
Empires always (Fall!)2Embed
