Sssnakepit Lyrics
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing...
Oh, cut this tension, it's too much!

Situation volatile, seriously hostile
Breadwinners, soul searchers
Fear merchants, seeking
Brightly coloured, no use for camouflage
When you're venomous and willing to sabotage
We're just a group of your white blood cells
Fighting off parasites
We're your system mechanics
Trying to fix this machine
What's the one thing that has
More speed, more strength
And goes deeper than us?
A nuclear submarine

Ah, come on, just open the door!
Knocked off my feet by the back draft
Brought back to earth
Oxygen clears my head
And I just gotta say
Oh, you're not gonna believe this
You can't perceive this
This is like nothing you've seen before
But lucky for you (Yeah, lucky for you!)
This is an open door

Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Down on your shoulders
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
Down on your shoulders
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Just push right back

Oh, you're not gonna believe this
You can't perceive this
This is like nothing you've seen before
But lucky for you (Yeah, lucky for you!)
They're well prepared, But they forgot one thing

Yeah, yeah, we're nice guys
Until we're not
So come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Down on your shoulders
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
Down on your shoulders
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Just push right back
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down
Come and join the party, leave anxieties behind
When the weight of all the world is pushing down

Just push right back, back, back
Just push right back, back, back
Just... Yeah
What was that?
Something like Louis Armstrong?
Anyway, whatever
Just... Yeah
Come and join the party
Fuck, that was shit2Embed
