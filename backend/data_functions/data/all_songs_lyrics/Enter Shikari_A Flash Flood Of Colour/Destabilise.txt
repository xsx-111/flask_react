Destabilise Lyrics
Today, for the very first time
We started planning out the ultimate crime
Locking together to destroy this cold stasis
Rory C, what's your thesis?
"I don't fucking believe this!"
Institutions are established and invested
Pause to ask, "Are they tried and tested?"
No, just force-fed and digested
It’s about time we damn contested

You can't stain us, you can't contain us
You can't destabilise, divide, or label us
You can't stain us, you can't contain us
You can't destabilise (Destabilise)

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
('Cause we know) 'Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course
(But we're stuck in the middle)
'Cause we don’t belong here
We don't belong here
We don’t belong here
Our minds are dormant and static
Don’t ever respect conventional thought without reason
We need to fucking erupt!

Corrupted fucking tyrants
Instigating violence
In sporadic discordance
We'll find maximum assurance

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
('Cause we know) 'Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course
But we're stuck in the middle
'Cause we don't belong here
Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
'Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course

This is the calm before the storm
One last siege to break the norm
So I can lie here on the floor
Beside you
No one owns the oceans
No one owns the mountains
No one owns us
No one owns us
We've all inherited this world
We need to fucking erupt!
'Cause this earth is ours!
We need to fucking erupt!
Yeah!

Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
('Cause we know) 'Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course
'Cause we don't belong here
Now they're cracking under pressure from our force
'Cause we don't belong here
So we're rising through this stubborn assault course
'Cause we don't belong here

This is the calm before the storm
One last siege to break the norm
So I can lie here on the floor
Beside you1Embed
