Brute LyricsBetween the liquor, the bed
The noise in my head
Between your mind and my crime
And me in the grime
Between the gun, the lead
The lies that I said
Through your sweet breath
Comes the dawn of my death
Touch me, hate me
Give yourself to me and break me
Cut these eyes, and I will see
Kiss these lying lips for me
Stroke this skin, and I will kneel
Brutalize me, I will heal
Between the bullet and my lip
The lies you let slip
Between the dirt of this soul
Your heart that's a hole
Between the place where you hit
This face where you spit
Through your sweet breath
Comes the dawn of my death
Touch me, hate me
Give yourself to me and break me
Cut these eyes, and I will see
Kiss these lying lips for me
Stroke this skin, and I will kneel
Brutalize me, I will heal
Cut these eyes, and I will see
Kiss these lying lips for me
Stroke this skin, and I will kneel
Brutalize me, I will heal

"I escape a lot of time, by sitting in my bunk and analyzing my past, you know?"
Cut these eyes, and I will see
Kiss these lying lips for me
Stroke this skin, and I will kneel
Brutalize me, I will heal
Cut these eyes, I will see
Kiss those lying lips for me
Stroke this skin, I will kneel
Brutalize me, I will heal
Cut these eyes, and I will see
Kiss these lying lips for me
Stroke this skin, and I will kneel
Brutalize me, I will healEmbed
