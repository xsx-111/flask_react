Search & Destroy Lyrics
Will we close our eyes?
Will we fall for those lies
Or will we make the conclusion
That this life's a delusion?
Will we do what we're told
'Til the day that we're sold
Or will we raise our voices
Make alternative choices?

(Watch out!) Our silence is death
(Watch out!) We shall resist the violence
(Watch out!) And we'll never give up
(Watch out!) Only death is silence

Are we victims or winners
Believers or sinners?
Do we sit in the saddle
Or are we just cattle?
Are we wretched or bold?
Are we garbage or gold?
Can we make the right call?
Can we change it at all?
(Watch out!) Our silence is death
(Watch out!) We shall resist the violence
(Watch out!) And we'll never give up
(Watch out!) Only death is silence

"And that is what this country is looking for now."


Acceptance is surrender
Vile and vicious slander
We don't want to be ruled
By a handful of fools

(Watch out!) Our silence is death
(Watch out!) We shall resist the violence
(Watch out!) And we'll never give up
(Watch out!) Only death is silence
(Watch out!) Our silence is death
(Watch out!) We shall resist the violence
(Watch out!) And we'll never give up
(Watch out!) Only death is silence
Will we close our eyes?
Will we fall for those lies
Or will we make the conclusion
That this life's a delusion?Embed
