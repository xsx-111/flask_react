Submit and reveal
What you hide and conceal
Open up and enable
Put your cards on the table
Conquer and define
Your life is on the line
Roll up and blackout
No time to hesitate and doubt
Take what you're being given
Make your stand
'Cause the life that you're livin'
May soon come to an end
Do what you can
What you want
What you must
Feel the hunger inside
Hold on to your trust
Confess and purge
Experience every urge
Approach and achieve
Strengthen your belief
Admit and defend your emotions
'Cause they send out
The message that it's you
And that's the only thing that's true
Do what you can
What you want
What you must
Feel the hunger inside
Hold on to your trust
Do what you can
What you want
What you must
Feel the hunger inside
Don't lose your trust
Safe and secure
Never be too sure
Show and tell
Until you go to Hell
Love and hate
You're destined by fate
Play and work
Enjoy your time on Earth
Do what you can
What you want
What you must
Feel the hunger inside
Hold on to your trust
Only death is eternal
Make no mistake
What it all comes down to
Night shall overtake
Do what you can
What you want
What you must
Feel the hunger inside
Hold on to your trust
Do what you can
What you want
What you must
Feel the hunger inside
Don't lose your trust
Do what you can
You're a beautiful child
Do what you want
From a beautiful land
Do what you can
You left a curse on me
Do what you want
Could you live without me?
Do what you can
Just one way
Do what you want
One last kiss
Do what you must
Give me the bullet
Don't lose your trustEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
