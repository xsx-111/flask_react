Beast Lyrics

My youth is wasted
I'm evasive and vague
I'm a headless beast
I'm a subtle plague
I'm a cheatin' liar
I am naked terror
I hurt, I wound
I'm a fatal error

I don't make sense
I got my pride
Don't need no meaning
I feel no shame
I will not believe
I got no choice
I'm out of control
And I love it

I'm a non-believer
I refuse and resist
I don't play no more
I'm a terrorist
I'm a radical pig
I exploit and abuse
I am total chaos
Strange and abstruse
I'm a cheatin' liar
I am naked terror
I hurt, I wound
I'm a fatal error
I don't make sense
I got my pride
Don't need no meaning
I feel no shame
I will not believe
I got no choice
I'm out of control
And I love it

I don't make sense
I got my pride
Don't need no meaning
I feel no shame
I will not believe
I got no choice
I'm out of control
And the kids just love it

I'm a man who's sick
But I got class
'Cause you only get respect
When you're kickin' ass
I don't make sense
But I got my pride
I need no meaning
I feel no shame
I will not believe
But I got no choice
I'm out of control
But I love it

I don't make sense
I got my pride
Don't need no meaning
I feel no shame
I will not believe
I got no choice
I'm out of control
And the kids just love it

Non-compliance
Non-aggressive
Non-contagious
Non-involvement
Non-productive
Non-religious
Non-resistant
Non-subjective
I don't make sense
Don't need no meaning
I don't make sense
Don't need no meaning
I will not believe
I will not believe
I will not believe
I will not believe
I will not believe
I will not believeEmbed
