When you peel back my eyes
I see the pain and feel alive
My hatred heaps upon this fire
That burns inside, and you blow higher
But I don't need you anymore
You cannot hurt me anymore
Keep it away from the fire
Unless you want it to burn
It burns, wildfire
Give it to me
Wildfire
Don't take it from me
Wildfire
Give it
And when you take me in your mind
Into this dirty, sodden shrine
I do not need you anymore
You cannot hurt me anymore
Keep it away from the fire
Unless you want it to burn
It burns, wildfire
Give it to me
Wildfire
Don't take it from me
Wildfire
Give it to me
Set on fire
Don't take it from me
Wildfire
Take it
And when you peel back my eyes
I see the pain and feel alive
My hatred heaps upon this fire
That burns inside, and you blow higher

Keep it away from the fire
Unless you want it to burn
It burns, wildfire
Give it to me
Wildfire
Don't take it from me
Wildfire
Give it to me
It burns, wildfire
Don't take it from me
Wildfire
Give it
Wildfire
Give it to me
Wildfire
Don't take it from me
Wildfire
Give it to me
Wildfire
Don't take it from me
Caught on fire
On fire
On fire
I do not need you anymore
On fire
You cannot hurt me anymore
Fire
Give it, give it to me
On fire
I do not need you anymore
Fire
You cannot hurt me anymore
Fire
I do not need you anymore
Fire
You cannot hurt me anymore
