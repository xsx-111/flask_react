Disobedience LyricsThis is the throne where hatred keeps
And what is sown is never reaped
This is the blindness that you need
This is the vein on which you feed
Surrender
It's just one twist
I will surrender
My aching wrist
I can't remember
It's never enough
I will surrender
It's never enough
Oh my darling
One for all and all for one
Give me reason
The quest for truth
Give me something
Disobedient yet responsive
To believe in
Out of darkness, there will be light
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
This is the dignity that you felt
This is the gutter where you have knelt
Surrender
It's just one twist
I will surrender
My aching wrist
I can't remember
It's never enough
I will surrender
It's never enough
Oh my darling
It's a war with no winners
Give me reason
When violence hits home
Give me something
Ignorance is your religion
To believe in
Take this spear and heal thyself
Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Disobedience
One too many lies
Disobedience
It's the greatest swindle
Disobedience
Everything falls into place
Disobedience
Take these words and feel thyself
This is your wretched, heavin' high
These are the shamed, the damned, the blamed
I can smell the slowly spreadin' stain
Oh, the burden of shame
Oh my darling
Give me reason
Give me something
To believe inEmbed
