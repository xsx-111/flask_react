Revolution LyricsIn fear of my life
I went suddenly crazy
Surrounded by beasts
In a world of disease
I'm in fear, I'm in anger
I'm in a desperate state
I will be careful now
And I will make no mistake
What's gonna happen?
I need to know
I don't want to suffer
Is it yes, or is it no?
If there's a hard way
It's gotta be mine
But I learned my lesson
And I'm gonna be fine
What's gonna happen?
I need to know
I don't want to suffer
Is it yes, or is it no?
It's the end of this world
Something's gone wrong
Give me one last kiss
Revolution has begun
What's gonna happen?
I need to know
I don't want to suffer
Is it yes, or is it no?
It's the end of this world
Something's gone wrong
Give me one last kiss
Revolution has begun
It's the end of this world
Something must end
Time is right for a change
It is all in our hands
What's gonna happen?
What's gonna happen?
What's gonna happen?
Nobody knowsEmbed
