La Dee Da Lyrics
Look out 'cause you know what you're doing
Turn up the American ruse
Whitehouse, Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom

You don't own this, La Dee Da
You don't own this, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Do you notice, La Dee Da?
Got me goin', how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear God

Hate if I want to
Love who I like
Hate if I want to, hate
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to, hate

You can't shame me, La Dee Da
Give or take me, how bizarre
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Keep your pretty promise to yourself
Dear God
Hate if I want to
Love who I like
Hate if I want to, hate
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to


Hate if I want to
Love who I like
Hate if I want to
Psychic Television and Death in June
Jim Jones painting in a blue bedroom
Hate if I want to

Keep your pretty crosses to yourself6Embed
