Tunguska LyricsI woke up in the late afternoon
From a dream in which I left you
And the ceiling teemed with gold surface tension
Skipping off my neighbor's pool
A hiker's ghost, a halo
Your face was resting damp on my chest
Fever clouded eyes
What's next to my head
So of course you knew
You'd dreamed it too
I emerged as if through a narrowed eye
Into lashes of white sun
From your apartment
And pollen clouds
Held absent sound
Then a stream of revenants surged outward
Like prominences from the sun
1927, an explosion
Another Tunguska
And at once I was flat on my back
And my skateboard rolled on down the hill
And all the congregating deer
Stood stock still
In the corridor of
Manicured lawns
Remember you and I'd get so high
We'd pass out with our shoes on
First light through leaves
This was back when my smoke would juke
And stutter in the highway crossbreezeEmbed
