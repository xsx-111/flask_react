What Dogs See LyricsI lost myself in the web that was spun
In that sweet smelling dim dirt full basement
From Prince Edward Island I hitched a long way
Winding turnpikes and orange glow worms
To a lake in the wilderness shining in black
With a silver forest form an ellipse
In its depths found a monolith adorned with great paintings of wolves with yellow little sides
The grey, freezing water â€” it swirled around, whispering
Tuned from a phonograph, stuffed between brain cells for months
Since I heard your voice issue those phrases
I touched the world slowly, each ray of the spectrum
Revealed itself to me, dark matter was illuminated
In his extremities into this way of being
Serpents writhing on all sides of me
Celestial castles whose spectral planets
Filled gaps between stars in the night sky voids crystallize
This is what dogs see, oh, this is why they bay
And cower at something just over your shoulderEmbed
