Where Did His Eye Go? LyricsWell, he used to be the star of stage and screen
But now he only sees half of everything
A funny little man with the straight black hair
He lost it in an accident, but he doesn't care
And where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But nothing can stop him now
I saw him late last night on the telethon
He's doing "Candy Man" with his glasses on
And then I saw him sing "What Kind of Fool Am I?"
He whipped off his glasses, and I looked at his eye
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But nothing can stop him now
We really love that boy
He brought us so much joy
He even used to be a goy
But things are different now
And I'm still wonderin' how
He'll keep an eye out for me now and then
But does he see in 3D?
(Where did his eye go?)
But is it lookin' at me?
(Where did his eye go?)
But is it lookin' at me?
(Where did his eye go?)
But is it lookin' at me?
(Where did his eye go?)
Yeah, but where'd his eye go?
Yeah, he used to be the star of stage and screen
But now he only sees half of everything
He was a funny little man with straight black hair
He lost it in an accident, but he doesn't care
So, where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But nothing can stop him now
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But where'd his eye go?
I don't know
But nothing can stop him now

I don't know...Embed
