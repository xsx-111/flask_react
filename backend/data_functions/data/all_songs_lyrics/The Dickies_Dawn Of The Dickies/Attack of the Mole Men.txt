Attack of the Mole Men LyricsIn the land of Atlantis where the sun don't shine
It gets darker down there every day
That's when two explorers fell into a mine
And that's the price they had to pay
They carry their clubs upon their back
(Mole men, mole men)
They climb up on ground and then attack
(Mole men, mole men)
Beware of the head mole man, Jack
They're the slavery labor of the underground
Their masters make them suffer and work
If you listen you're sure to hear the terrible sound
Of mole men crawling out of the dirt
They carry their clubs upon their back
(Mole men, mole men)
They climb up on ground and then attack
(Mole men, mole men)
Beware of the head mole man, Jack
(Mole men, mole men)

They carry their clubs upon their back
(Mole men, mole men)
They climb up on ground and then attack
(Mole men, mole men)
Beware of the head mole man, Jack
(Mole men, mole men)
Beware of the head mole man, Jack
(Mole men, mole men)Embed
