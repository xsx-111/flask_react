Manny, Moe And Jack LyricsWhen you're on the road
And your car won't pull that load
And your wheels aren't really feeling fine
Well, I know of this joint
Where they'll check your plugs and points
I know these guys, they're three good friends of mine
Manny, Moe and Jack
They know what I'm after
Manny, Moe and Jack
They know what I'm after
They really know

Manny, Moe and Jack
Once you're inside
They won't take you for a ride
They've got a good deal for you and your automobile
For the right price
They will sell you fuzzy dice
And leather hand grips for your steering wheel
Manny, Moe and Jack
They know what I'm after
Manny, Moe and Jack
They know what I'm after
They really know
Manny, Moe and Jack
If it's tires you want, they've got a lot for you
Dunlop, Firestone, Pirelli too
Manny, Moe and Jack 
Manny, Moe
Manny, Moe and Jack
They know what I'm after
Manny, Moe and Jack
They know what I'm after
They really know

Manny, Moe and Jack
They know what I'm after
Manny, Moe and Jack
They know what I'm after
Manny, Moe andEmbed
