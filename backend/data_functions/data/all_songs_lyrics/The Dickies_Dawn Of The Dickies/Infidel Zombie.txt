Infidel Zombie LyricsWell, I've been running for a while
And I know that I'm the next in line
She's been gettin' trigger happy
I've heard so far that she's killed nine
Well it's a complicated tale
With a price on my head
And a sharp-lookin' agent
Who wants to find me certified dead
She's an infidel zombie
And she gets depressed with duress
A love that cannot find me
She's an infidel zombie
Let me tell you
I don't believe it, there's a bullet with my name on it now
They caught me once
While I was out messin' around
They put me in cemented wedges
But I didn't drown
I'm back on the streets
And I'm running for my life again
But I know they'll tear it down
And they're gonna start to closin' in
She's an infidel zombie
And she gets depressed with duress
A love that cannot find me
She's an infidel zombie
Let me tell you
I don't believe it, there's a bullet with my name on it now

She's an infidel zombie
And she gets depressed with duress
A love that cannot find me

She's an infidel zombie
Let me tell you
I don't believe it, there's a bullet with my name on it now
(I don't believe it, there's a bullet with my name on it now)
I don't believe it, there's a bullet with my name on it nowEmbed
