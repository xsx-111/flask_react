Nights in White Satin LyricsNights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written him
Never meaning to send
Beauty I've always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore
Because I love you
Yes, I love you
Because I love you
Yes, I love you
Because I love you
But you don't want the 
Gazing at people
Some hand in hand
Just what I'm going through
They can't understand
Some try to tell me
Thoughts they cannot defend
Just what you want to be
You'll be in the end
Because I love you
Yes, I love you
Because I love you
'Cause I love you
Because I love you
But you don't want the 
'Cause you don't want the 

Nights in white satin
Never reaching the end
Letters I've written him
Never meaning to send
Beauty I've always missed
With these eyes before
Just what the truth is
I can't say anymore
Because I love you
Yes, I love you
Because I love you
Because I love you
'Cause I love you
But you don't want the 
'Cause you don't want the 
'Cause you don't want the 
'Cause you don't want theEmbed
