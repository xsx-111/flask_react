Fan Mail LyricsDear sirs
To whom this may concern
There's facts I'd like to learn
So many things I wanna know
Especially trivial info
Paraphernalia, badges and regalia
Please send me everything
'Cause I am interested in you
And everything you do
I find myself at all your shows
Could you tell me where you buy your clothes?
Could you sign my little sister's face?
Just put your signature any place
And please send me a bio
'Cause we've got fan mail
Well, we really really need it
Fan mail
Well, we really really read it
I sent you my letter, now I want a reply
If you don't know any better, then you won't take your time
With my fan mail
So I would like to know just if and when
You'll be in town again
So that I could meet with you
And brag at my friends at school
Have you been all around the world?
Have you seen every kind of girl
Or are you from the other side?
'Cause you
You can't believe everything that you read
The hypocrisy and the greed
The papers, all the things that they say
They don't tell me anything anyway
That's why I gotta get it straight from you
Concerning your situation
Without an obligation
'Cause we've got fan mail
Well, we really really read it
Fan mail
Well, we really really need it
I sent you my letter, now I want a reply
If you don't know any better, then you won't take the time
With my fan mail
What's this?
I find to my surprise
The bands that I idolized
No longer seem to exist
Now tell me, what could be the cause of this?
Perhaps it could be their egos
I tell you, heaven only knows
I didn't even get a newsletter
'Cause we've got fan mail
Well, we really really read it
Fan mail
Well, we really really need it
I sent you my letter, now I want a reply
If you don't know any better, then you won't take the time
With my fan mail
Well, we really really read it
Fan mail
Well, we really really need it
I sent you my letter, now I want a reply
If you don't know any better, then you won't take your time
With my fan mail
Send it out to me
