Horology Lyrics
Once upon a time
There was a great hermit dominion
Veiled from inside and out
Ruled by a lone eremite
Bringer of an inferno
Conduit to Satan himself
To Tchort, Abaddon, and Set
A demented figurehead
Heinous looking thing, he was
Cold and terrible
A long and aquiline nose
Between swelling temples
His green eyes, a window
To the Ninth Circle of Hell
A tiny neck supporting a head
Filled with an unbending desolation

Seditious bands storm the bastion
Alive with revenge
Grand intentions
Unbeknownst protomartyrs
Indoctrinated
With impalement
Just like that the plot was crushed
Brushed away without a thought
Some were found alive, though
Left to roam without their skin
Cauterized and blistering
Forever marked for all to see
Reminding those who think dissent
Is a bridge across the sea
One did make a pilgrimage
In search of a family
Evaporated in the dark
Stolen by the despot
A journey made all the worse
Having had his eyes gouged
He left without the gift of sight
To face his true destroyer

Across the land he walked with death
Parading his
Ossuary
Upon reaching the castle walls
A twist of fate
His mind baulks
Sit down weary traveler
I am that what you seek
Join me in a meal
To hear of my repentance
Lift the veil from your eyes
And look beyond the three
Now you know the truth behind:
