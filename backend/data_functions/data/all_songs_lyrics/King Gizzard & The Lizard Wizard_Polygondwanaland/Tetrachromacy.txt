Tetrachromacy Lyrics
I heard a story, could be true
About a colour under blue
You couldn't see it with your eyes
Or invent with intellect

Like the inverse of colourblindness
It's shrouded like a natural gas
I've got to see it for myself
Settle my own curiousness

Back and forth swing like the tide
I look to the left and through to right
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

The story man was glassy-eyed
He told me about the power lines
And in subarctic caribou eyes
The metal wires burst into life

They flick across the territory
Resplendent mackerel sky
Some of the snow absorbs UV
Unseeable crumbs in dye
Picking up clues 'bout my eyes
I scrutinize the iris of the storm's eye
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see

Polygondwanaland

Inconspicuous hue will be
Crowded camouflage to me
My three shades are divisible
Lust to see the invisible

Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see
Tetrachromacy
See what I can't see1Embed
