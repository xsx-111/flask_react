Inner Cell Lyrics
Meet with me, in the dark
Of the street, there we'll start
Believing, secretly
Utopia, freedom in
The inner cell
Look for me, with a beak
A cloak adorned, scent of leaves
A void between, foul stench
Of those above, whispering
Inner cell

Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris

From under the skin, insurrection
From hollow logs, from shallow streams
And drying seas

Let us walk through the night
To a place clandestine
Free your mind, disregard
All you know, infiltrate
The inner cell
You must not accept
His sick version of
Life itself, disrespect
Everything, multiply
Inner cell
Dance of the dead
Will descend on his head
And extend to the
Families' hubris


From under the skin, the flesh has rotten
Poison has spread, through words unsaid
Anemic rule, now hear me say
Our time has come, transcending us
Above the one, to ego death
For now he sits inside the fire
Oblivious that we will keep
Him in the spire, have found resolve
And our own crimes to commit
In cold blood as he did his8Embed
