The Fourth Colour Lyrics
I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour

Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy
I am born again
I see the light
It's in my face
My brain is storing information
Now I am a god in a photon
I see through walls
I see your heat
I can see your terror
With sight you can see the future

I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour
I can see, tetrachromacy
I see the fourth colour
Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy supreme
And see all that has been
All that will be
Third eye is free
I am not body
Tetrachromacy
Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets holy supreme
And has seen all that has been all that will be
Third eye is free
I am no body
Tetrachromacy
Rising up out of my body
I am omnipresent for thee
Many fingers, many minds and
Many eyeballs puppet my feet
I walk the streets
I believe the hyperbole
I see the fourth colour

I am born again
I see the light
It's in my face
I am analyzing information
Now I am a god
