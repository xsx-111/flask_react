Polygondwanaland Lyrics
Goodbye kinsman, polygon
I'm goin' abroad, gondwana
Drift until I, polygon
Get to my stop, gondwanaland
Grand and never been
Seen by man, veil of a dream

We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland

Exit snow melts, polygon
Float on rain drops, gondwana
It will get hot, polygon
Fasten seatbelts, gondwanaland
Sand and mountains
Unbosom its hidden hand

We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
Polygondwanaland

Polygondwanaland
Can I see the eye
That sees me? Please show me these

We're gonna get there
We don't need a whereabouts
We're gonna get there
Follow where the river runs
We're gonna get there
