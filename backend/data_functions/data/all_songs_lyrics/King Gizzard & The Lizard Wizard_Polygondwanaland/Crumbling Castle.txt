Crumbling Castle Lyrics
Meet me glassy-eyed, blind, and divine
Hold down the fort on the coastline
The castle is a pimple on the face of our orb
A humble spot for clues to drop if you eavesdrop

I see through the bricks, to the sea, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

We wait for the death, that does not come, crumbling castle
Dug all the holes in God's Acre, crumbling castle
We have even said our last rites, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our holding cell?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
We head to our extinction, crumbling castle
The sounds of the constant lightning
Would be enough to block out
The thought of the end of the world
If it were not for our tinnitus from the bomb

In the wind I sway, back and forth
I'm brittle as an aged human being
Where my walls are safe from wild weather
The filth forms into great nastiness
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle

I don't want to fall into dust
I don't want nothing but to live on
The ache inside my keep spurs me on
I don't want to be invisible
Polygondwanaland

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
On this very day, in one thousand years
The earth will be relative to the sun and the moon
And a new world will be created
I know because it is written here

I see through the bricks to the sea, crumbling castle
Inching closer each century, crumbling castle
Water's rising up, thick and green, crumbling castle
Are we safe in our citadel?

Look upon our condition, crumbling castle
You would not believe where I'm from, crumbling castle

I don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle
Don't want to be a crumbling, crumbling, crumbling castle13Embed
