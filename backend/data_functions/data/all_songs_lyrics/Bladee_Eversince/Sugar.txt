Sugar Lyrics
I will tell you the truth
I wanna take your youth
I wanna drink from you

Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar, baby
Like sugar, baby

Demons say "I deserve your DNA"
Be awake, forever for you, I wait
It's okay, it's okay, to go away
It might take a life to pay, pay it with the razor blade
Tell me what you want to say
I can't take the truth today, so tell me a fairy tale
Heaven say, "I'm on my way"
I don't care what Heaven say, I'm waiting for your embrace

You don't want me, do you?
You don't want me, do you?
Know what I'll do to you
Wish I never knew you
I wonder what you do
When I'm gone
Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar, baby
Like sugar, baby
Your blood tastes so sweet
Like sugar, baby
Like sugar, baby26Embed
