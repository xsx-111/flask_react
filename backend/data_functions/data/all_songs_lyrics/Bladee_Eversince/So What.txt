So What Lyrics
Chainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat and my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Comin' from the dark with my scars, no sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck, on my way back down

I'll survive a snake bite
I live in the late night
I can see the hate rise
Smokin' on the gray skies
I went to hell eight times
Now I got a sick mind
I know that you want mine
Heard it through the grapevine
I don't know your star sign
I been goin' snowblind
I don't need to slow down
Put me in a ghost shrine
I am going rogue now
Ziploc for the low down
Codeine in my blood, fam
Shouts out to the Shield Gang
Chainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat and my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Comin' from the dark with my scars, no sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck, on my way back down

Don't know how to show love
Please don't get your hopes up
You might get your soul crushed
Closed up like a rosebud
I just got my throat cut
Hope I don't get cold blood
Now I'm goin' ghost, feel like Phantom of the Opera
Shiftin' my persona
Codeine in my soda
Slipped into a coma
Wish I never woke up
Ever since we sold out
People say they know us
Margiela loafers but I know he's a poser
Chainsaw on your throat, all the words come out
Cocaine in my throat and my nose dripped down
Going with the flow, with the wind, go out
Comin' from the dark with my scars, no sound
I be in the park off a pill, so what?
You did this a year, but for me, for life
Drain Gang CEO, I'm the ice king now
I don't give a fuck on my way back down9Embed
