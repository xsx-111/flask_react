Rip Lyrics
At the psych ward, plugged in with the white bars
What's your life for? I'ma hit a high score
Let it die down, took it, now it's mine now
Gotta lie down, been here for a while now
Dig a hole for me, let go of me
You don't know me, you know of me
Don't talk 'bout me, come close to me
Come close to me, you're scared of me

R-R-RIP my hopes and dreams, I don't wanna wake up
We don't fuck with anyone, so you cannot snake us
I'm not here, you know I'm gone, I'm about to take off
Rollin' up a hundred grams every time I wake up
I'm a missing person though, I go off the radar
He's not here with us you know, he's a fuckin' traitor
You want cop some acid, bro? I'm sellin' you paper
I don't care about anything, you know I'm a Drainer

Flexing all that shit to me, it's nothing
He's not Drain Gang, he a lame, fuck him
They gonna approach me like I'm Justin
You know I'm comin'
Poppin' out of nothin'
Bitch, I know you're bluffin'
I don't run from nothin'
I'm a fuckin' junkie
I love wasting money
I think that they love me
I don't love 'em back though
I'm not comin' back, bro
I just lost my last hope
R-R-RIP my hopes and dreams, I don't wanna wake up
We don't fuck with anyone, so you cannot snake us
I'm not here, you know I'm gone, I'm about to take off
Rollin' up a hundred grams every time I wake up
I'm a missing person though, I go off the radar
He's not here with us you know, he's a fuckin' traitor
You want cop some acid, bro? I'm sellin' you paper
I don't care about anything, you know I'm a Drainer
RIP my hopes and dreams, I don't wanna wake up
We don't fuck with anyone, so you cannot snake us
I'm not here, you know I'm gone, I'm about to take off
Rollin' up a hundred grams every time I wake up
I'm a missing person though, I go off the radar
He's not here with us you know, he's a fuckin' traitor
You want cop some acid, bro? I'm sellin' you paper
I don't care about anything, you know I'm a Drainer5Embed
