Wrist Cry Lyrics
Wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry

Flying in the sky
Going to a lonely star tonight, tonight
I'm falling through the clouds
Can't deny I got you on my mind, on my mind
Blood is on my mind
Blade is on my wrist, it makes it cry, make it cry
I feel like I could die
I feel like I don't care if I survive, I survive

Wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry
I'm faceless in this kind of situation
I know what you playing, trying to drive me crazy
Trying to be something that you can't be
I am in a mansion, something that you can't reach
Fuck 'em, I'ma put 'em on the black list
Pull up in a Lotus, think I have a death wish
I'm forever young, might let the coke drip
I don't give a fuck, I get my throat slit

Wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry, wrist cry
Wrist cry
Wrist cry

I'm falling through the clouds
Can't deny I got you on my mind, on my mind
I feel like I could die
I feel like I don't care if I survive, I survive11Embed
