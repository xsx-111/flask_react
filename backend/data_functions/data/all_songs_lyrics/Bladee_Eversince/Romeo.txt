Romeo Lyrics
Feel like Romeo, Moncler coat when it's cold
Off a flat, I'm not feeling you
That is true
Can't be seen with you, but it's cool
I froze myself, now I'm freezing you
Fuck life and your feelings too
Nightmares coming true
Creeping up, black Audi truck, and I'm dripping blood

Today I been falling, falling, falling
Don't know what you say
You keep calling, calling, calling out my name
Don't talk it, I don't want to hear you talking
I'm not sorry, I'm just honest
I am in the heart of darkness
For me, you don't have to do anything
When I'm in your area the flowers start withering
Ice world, everything glittering
Ice girl, I'ma ice her with some better things
I'ma treat myself with fucking medicine
To feel something, I'd do anything
I've been only moving up and leveling
You fucked up again, you let the devil in
Feel like Romeo, Moncler coat when it's cold
Off a flat, I'm not feeling you
That is true
Can't be seen with you, but it's cool
I froze myself, now I'm freezing you
Fuck life and your feelings too
Nightmares coming true
Creeping up, black Audi truck, and I'm dripping blood
Feel like Romeo, Moncler coat when it's cold
Off a flat, I'm not feeling you
That is true
Can't be seen with you, but it's cool12Embed
