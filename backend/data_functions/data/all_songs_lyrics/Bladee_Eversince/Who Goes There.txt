Who Goes There Lyrics
Who goes there? It's the ghost of October
Summer's over, now I'm goin' nowhere
Who holds her? It's not me, I'm a loner
But I don't wanna go-go-go there
You're sober, that's not me, I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there? It's just me and my soldiers
I come from the snow, it's cold-cold-colder

It's bad, it's bad
You don't know what I am, I'm a sick man
And this world feels so distant
But today I'm feelin' so indifferent
Every Friday's Halloween
My week is a dream, I'm just walkin' in my sleep
By any means I'll be lowkey
I'm gonna need a reason to be seen
All the prayer is for nothing
No touching, I find it disgusting
Flyin' in my lane with my cousin
Why they bugging? I don't do discussion
I'm on an airplane to London
They want something from me all of a sudden
I come up when I'm summoned
I heard everything was gonna change but it worsened
Who goes there? It's the ghost of October
Summer's over, now I'm going nowhere
Who holds her? It's not me, I'm a loner
But I don't wanna go-go-go there
You're sober, that's not me, I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there? It's just me and my soldiers
I come from the snow, it's cold-cold-colder
Who goes there? It's the ghost of October
Summer's over, now I'm going nowhere
Who holds her? It's not me, I'm a loner
But I don't wanna go-go-go there
You're sober, that's not me, I'm a stoner
I prefer it when the world moves slower
Who goes there? It's just me and my soldiers
I come from the snow, it's cold-cold-colder16Embed
