Xd Out Lyrics
If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
If I don't know you, you get X'd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go, you're being let down

I'm in the darkness with a rag on
I'm looking for you for the last time
If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
Don't lose your face hanging with some lames
I lost my brain smoking toxic waste
The water sprayed with MDMA
I'm with the drain, they won't go away
Don't lose your ways, you can get betrayed
I'm in the shade, but I'm making plays
I'm out, it's late, but I'm on my way
Go to the club, gonna celebrate

If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
If I don't know you, you get X'd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go, you're being let down
Your friends talk behind your back
Told me they don't fuck with you, I didn't even ask
They wanna be Drain Gang but they can't
How am I gon' trust you when you switch up on your man?
Catching all these feelings, catch my hands
I don't catch emotions, I'ma cash out in the bank
Chilling at the roof, you look like ants
You don't know what I've been through, you'll never understand

My heart, where did it go?
My heart, where did it go?
Nobody knows

If you're not bleeding, you're not drained out
If I don't know you, you get X'd out
I've just been planning how to get out
I'm letting go, you're being let down11Embed
