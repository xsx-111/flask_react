Skin Lyrics
I don't want to go back to that place again (Again)
Nothing will ever be the same again (Be the same again)
Never even cared if it's fake, pretend (No)
Maybe you can show me what it takes to end forever
Emptiness, it came again
When it's from inside you know you can't defend against it
Writing, but I can't press send (No)
Kisses from the raindrops tell me "Wait again, one last time"

Clean, clean, clean, cut the rope, let me in
Wings, wings, wings, I grow wings, I go in
Scars, scars, scars, I got scars on my arms
Fall, fall, fall, out of love and apart
Skin, skin, skin, let that skin touch the skin
Win, win, win, never was, never been (No)
I'm sinking, it goes up to my chin
White, white, white, gray to black eversince

No
No
I don't know
I don't know
Clean, clean, clean, cut the rope, let me in (Let me in)
Wings, wings, wings, I grow wings, I go in (I go in)
Scars, scars, scars, I got scars on my arms (No)
Fall, fall, fall, out of love and apart (Love)
Skin, skin, skin, let that skin touch the skin (Touch the skin)
Win, win, win, never was, never been (Never been)
I'm sinking, it goes up to my chin (To my chin)
White, white, white, gray to black eversince14Embed
