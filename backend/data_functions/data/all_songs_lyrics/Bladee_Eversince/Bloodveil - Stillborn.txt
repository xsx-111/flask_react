Bloodveil / Stillborn Lyrics
The first born got his world torn
I came out of the ice storm
This blood sword is my light source
At the white shores when the night falls
Was my life form worth to cry for?
Off like 10 pills, now I'm stillborn
Gotta stay pure just to make sure
Gotta watch out who you fall for

Smelling like an orchid, I got sources, it's imported
It's another morning, there's no ending to my story
Got the blood veil, I just almost met the reaper
In the shadows and I breathe them
In the ghost house with my people, it's the Shield Gang
I got all these shields and you can't breach them
On a plane, I'm switching seasons
Wait for God to give a reason to me
Daytime creeping, I can't fuck with human beings
I'm not sure what to believe in, I catch commas, not no feelings
You know Drain Gang, I got vampires in my city
Hit the party, take 'em with me, hit me up when I'm not busy
Feel like Casper, feel like you can't see me when I'm friendly
You can see me wearing Fendi as soon as I made my entry
The first born got his world torn
I came out of the ice storm
This blood sword is my light source
At the white shores when the night falls
Was my life form worth to cry for?
Off like 10 pills, now I'm stillborn
Gotta stay pure just to make sure
Gotta watch out who you fall for

Off some pink flats, trying to get my feelings back
Breathing in the ash, X should mark the hidden past
A thousand bits of glass on me, I got glitter hands
Turning into sand, vacuum seal like plastic bags
Sleeping with a chain on me, feel like 50 Shades
Issey Miyake, CDG my aftershave
It feels like acid rain, every day I feel the same
Maybe in a way I will never feel again
I gotta disconnect when they get too intimate
Black Afghan, breaking open cigarettes
I'm so innocent, but I got some evil friends
I just wanna spend, never fall in love again3Embed
