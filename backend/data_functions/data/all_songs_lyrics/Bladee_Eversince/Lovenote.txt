Lovenote Lyrics
Someone free me from my skin
Evaporated, now I'm gone in the wind
Something ended, but nothing new did begin
I carry weight until my spine's giving in

My words, they didn't mean a thing
I was just trying to get in
You're looking for someone, but I'm not him
What do you want from me? I'm just wondering
Hating on the kid, but I don't want to live
I don't have anything to give to you
I stay with the crew
And we don't need anything from you
I've been to Hell and back for twenty stacks
I keep on going 'til my visions black
I'm lost and I'm not going back
And I got a pack, leave me, I don't wanna match
It's funny how they wanna act
X-Ray Gucci shades so I can see through that
Cut you in your throat and make you free at last
And they stalk me when I'm out, I gotta wear a mask

She gave me a lovenote
But I woke up with a cut throat
I can't let you come close
I'm the one your god chose, I stay in the condos
She gave me a lovenote
But I woke up with a cut throat
I can't let you come close
I'm the one your god chose, I stay in the condos
I will change for you, can I see you soon?
I've stayed up so many moons
I've been waiting for you, I don't know what to do
I want the darkness to take over for me too
But the pain be true, take it away from you
You disrespect SG then they gon' sentence you
I'm with the Drain, it's true, thinkin' 'bout draining you
Blood dripping on my Margiela shoes

She gave me a lovenote
But I woke up with a cut throat
I can't let you come close
I'm the one your god chose, I stay in the condos
She gave me a lovenote
But I woke up with a cut throat
I can't let you come close
I'm the one your god chose, I stay in the condos7Embed
