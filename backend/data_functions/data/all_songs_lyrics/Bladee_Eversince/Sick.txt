Sick Lyrics
Still sick, still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, twelve grams in a zip
Us, we don't mix
Triple six for my wrist
Blood on my lips

I can't stand, I'ma sit
I was broke, now I'm fixed
Black skies ever since
I hope I won't be missed
From the rain to the snow, going in
I am sick, I'm not sane
I don't know what I think
I can't see anything
Call my friends, give me wings
SG, Drain Gang who I'm with (SG, Drain Gang who I'm with)
Don't get lost in this shit (Don't get lost)
I don't want to be seen

Still sick, still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, twelve grams in a zip
Us, we don't mix
Triple six for my wrist
Blood on my lips
Still sick, still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, still sick
Still sick, twelve grams in a zip
Us, we don't mix
Triple six for my wrist
Blood on my lips1Embed
