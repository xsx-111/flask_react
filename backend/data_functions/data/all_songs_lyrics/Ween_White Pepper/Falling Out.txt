Falling Out LyricsI recall a time when we were lovers
Before you, I hadn't any other
When the bad times came along
I turned and you had gone
From the start
I loved you
I was wrong
Falling out
It's the end
May as well have never been
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again
Don't consider me your friend
Falling out
Look away
It's the end
Always thought of you as my big brother
Never knew we couldn't trust each other
Two faces I could see
As you shook my money tree
There's no more
You and me
Let it be
Falling out
It's the end
And I lose another friend
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again
Don't consider me your friend
Falling out
Look away
It's the end
Falling out
It's the end
May as well have never been
The cards are up, the chips are all cashed in
You won't see me again
Don't consider me your friend
Falling out
Look away
It's the end
Falling out
Look away
It's the end2Embed
