Bananas And Blow Lyrics
Sancho brought a message from the Fat Man
"Sorry, boy, to leave you high and dry
But I went to see my mom in Ensenada
And I left a little something to help the time go by
Just a little something to help to keep you high"

Bananas and blow, bananas and blow (Bananas and blow)
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow

Now the rainy season reminds me of Maria
The way she danced, the color of her hair
Now I'm locked inside a stall in the cantina
Eating the bananas and the cocaine off the mirror
Looking for a ticket to take me away from here

Bananas and blow, bananas and blow (Bananas and blow)
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow
Bananas and blow, bananas and blow (Bananas and blow)
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow

Vamos amigo
Bananas and blow, bananas and blow (Bananas and blow)
Stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blow
Bananas and blow, bananas and blow (Bananas and blow)
I'm stuck in my cabana, living on bananas and blowEmbed
