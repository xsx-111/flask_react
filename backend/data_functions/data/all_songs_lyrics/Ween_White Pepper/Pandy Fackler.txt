Pandy Fackler LyricsPandy Fackler was a working girl
Living alone in another world
Of picket fences and a white fa√ßade
Sucking dicks under the Promenade
She was almost in a coma - from doing the Bossa Nova
And the Funky Cold Medina - man, I wish you coulda seen her
Poor little Pandy is doing the best she can
Eating cotton candy from the garbage can
First to come and the last to go
I met her backstage after the second show
Two lonely people on a summer night
We weren't in love but it was still alright
I held her close and she squeezed me tight - my Pandy!
