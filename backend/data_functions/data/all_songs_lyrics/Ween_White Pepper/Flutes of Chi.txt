Flutes of Chi Lyrics
Everything that you are, that you'd like to be
Will come in three, my friend
Times thine inequity, the flutes of the chi
Will sound again, my friend

Wrap yourself up with gold, the fruits of the old
Are ripe to be told, my friend
For it's not what you are, how you've come to be
All this will end and begin again

Everything that you are, that you'd like to be
Will come in three, my friend
Times thine inequity, the flutes of the chi
Will sound again, my friendEmbed
