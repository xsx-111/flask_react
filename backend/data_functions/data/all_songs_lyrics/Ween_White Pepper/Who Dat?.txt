Who Dat? LyricsWho dat?
Tellin' me those lies
Brother, both my eyes ain't closed yet
Got a nice disguise
But I know you're really all wet
I'm a tool to this
Nothing you can do will make me fall
Got a date to keep
You missed the seat and pissed on the wall
What dat?
Crawlin' through the phone
Beggin' me to perform my very best
Call the publisher
Ask him to advance my next check
I'm a tool to this
Certainly I'm not used to this
I'm getting fat and I'm getting old
My little girl is turning four months old
Who you?
Spooky eyes that turn
Look down at the ground when I try to talk
Maybe I should try
Maybe I should take another walk
I'm a tool to this
Maybe you'd like to see me fall down
Might trip and lose my step
But I can swim and you won't see me drownEmbed
