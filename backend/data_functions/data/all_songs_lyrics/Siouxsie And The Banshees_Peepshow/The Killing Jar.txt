The Killing Jar Lyrics
Down where this ugly man seeks his sustenance
Down in the blue, midnight flare
A glass hand cuts through the water
Scything into his twisted roots
Then from his eyes spring fireflies
Breathing life into a roaring disguise

Needles and sins, sins and needles
He's gasping for air
In the wishing well

Dust to rust, ashes on gashes
Hand around the killing jar
Hand around the killing jar

A soft hoodwink of shadows the size of make-believe
Punches through his spike of rage
A glass hand cuts through the water
Snuffing out the magic fury
Then from inside bolt lightning cries
Swiftly crushed the final, muffled sighs
Oh, needles and sins, sins and needles
He's gasping for air
In the wishing well

Dust to rust, ashes on gashes
Hand around the killing jar
Hand around the killing jar

Hand around the killing jar
Hand around the killing jar
Hand around the killing jar
Hand around the killing jar
The killing jar1Embed
