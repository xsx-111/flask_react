Rhapsody LyricsIn the soil of our sadness
Hear our hearts bell a serenade
A faint choir tenderly shaping
A lament... a hollow refuge
In the blood of the twinkling sky
Breathing in air drunk dry
There was once a time of rapture
All is lost... a pale gleaming
Across this crooked land
Runs a crooked man
Our loved ones die
Under the hammer
Of the soviet sun
Nothing can erase this night
But there's still light with you
Rhapsody...
And if we can never see the sun
There's still light with you
Rhapsody...
And I have seen all I want to
And I have felt all I want to
Rhapsody...
But we can dream all we want to
We can dream all we want to1Embed
