Turn to Stone LyricsHigh above
The sickle moon
All senseless thought
Slips and drowns
A place, a time
Gone out of mind
Reaction swims
The opal time
Ferry me down -- leave well alone
Ferry me down -- turn to stone
Here within
My phantom flesh
Welcome in
The glowing guest
Far inside
The absolute
Instinct leaves
Us standing mute
Ferry me down -- leave well alone
Ferry me down -- turn to stone
Heaven sent
Some dark marvel
Fool's gold
As cold as marble
High above
The sickle moon
Your hidden dreams
Chill and swoon
A place, a time
Gone out of sight
Pulse the blood
Statue of light
Ferry me down -- leave well alone
Ferry me down -- turn to stoneEmbed
