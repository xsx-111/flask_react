Stinger (Five Wigs) LyricsWhen one line refuses to cover
His heart is already tied to another
If it's traced from the cycle I'm in
When the old turn stops the next one begins
One tenth-second will collapse a winger
Endangered by the point of a stinger
And now it's stuck in my gut
Is it my turn to keep the thing shut?
And the world, a small amount of time will treat mine
To get in mine
Sometimes you dream of people
Older than the city in the back of your mind
The pages tear away from the spine
And then it's your turn to make our mind
Five great wigs and the poacher has me
Staring like you don't want to see
But we come in like a blast from the past
We can fly by to make the thing last
And I'm asking to store it then a crusher is turned
I trust youEmbed
