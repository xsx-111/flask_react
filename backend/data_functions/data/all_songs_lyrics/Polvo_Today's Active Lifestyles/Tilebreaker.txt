Tilebreaker LyricsLaughing as the sea disappears
I could never drown in any water this clear
But some day I know it will float into place
Like a click, and a tick when you stick and I'll stop
Not knowing all the minds you've read
They wash up to shore and wind up rescued instead
Maybe what they wanted was a bucket of lead
To weigh you down
I don't need another breaker
To say that you're fine
I can reach out and touch it
Just made you to try
I don't need another breaker
To say that you're fine
I can reach out and touch it
(It's fake)
It's just what you like
Now I wanna follow some sounds
To say that your fine
Your footsteps that lead me
The whole world in mine
Clapping as the sky comes clean
The whistler is playing like nothing I've seen
And shortly I'm waiting for all
The amused
You can do like a wretch to deflect and then move
Not knowing all the minds you've read
I wash up to shore and wind up rescued instead
Maybe what I wanted was a bucket of lead
I don't need to know their names
(Behind Me)
Say that you're fine
Your reflection's direction
(You're Fake)
Was made to try
Don't need a Tile Breaker
To say that you're fine
I can reach out and touch them
(It's fake)
It's just what you like
Yeah I want to follow some sounds
(Found Me)
So say that you're fine
Your footsteps will lead me
Your new world is mine1Embed
