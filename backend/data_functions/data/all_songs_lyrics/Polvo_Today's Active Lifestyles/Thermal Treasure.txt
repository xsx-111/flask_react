Thermal Treasure LyricsPush me away on a lucky, lucky day
Don't offer me anything
A curse finding fortune I'll save
I know you've seen me shine
Bubbles and a twist of lime
Precious scent of roses will time
Now I'm the picture hanging upside down
Only you can flip it right
Like a stain you remember me fucking up the tapestry
Follow the grapevine down into the goldmine
Yes, there's a treasure and she guards it from behind a blank stare
And now I dare you to go back and how you said the tracks wouldn't stack
Finally I recognize the shape of your soul
Lounging in a crystal punch bowl
A toast to the overlooked queen takes a second look
I'll decorate it inside
Remember how it seemed so wide
It fills me up with second hand crime
Don't force me to resort to this
Staring in your empty fists
I'll pick one anyway, age of the counterfeit
Away
Under the rainbow
Yes, there's a treasure but she guards it from behind a blank stare
And now I dare you to go back
And how I said the tracks wouldn't stack
And if you go back take me the right path
It won't come upon me fast
Yes, there's a treasure but she guards it from behind a blank stare
Now I dare you to go back
And how I said the tracks wouldn't stack
And if you go back take me the right path
It won't come upon me fast
Yes, there's a treasure2Embed
