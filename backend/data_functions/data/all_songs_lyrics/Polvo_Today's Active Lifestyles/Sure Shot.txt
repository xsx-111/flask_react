Sure Shot LyricsAnd for every cross you make
One is taken in
And everything you shake
To await the end
And everything is prime
And nothing's clever
But longing when you die
As I got myself together
And for every cross you make
One gets taken in
And everything you shake
To await the end
And everything in code
Try to decipher
If I'm living when I'm old
I'm no longer the outsiderEmbed
