Action vs. Vibe LyricsYou said you didn't want to go out like that
Didn't want to go out like that
You can promise and deliver
At a time of action
Vibe
You said disappointment always comes in threes
And there's a challenge everywhere you see
But I won't be thinking like that
For a while
Vibe
You know I didn't want to go out like that
Didn't want to go out like that
You obey the transmitter
At this time of action
