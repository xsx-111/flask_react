Just a Little Bit LyricsI don't want much, I just want a little bit
No, no, no I don't want it all baby
I just want a little bit, oh yeah
Just a eeny weeny bit
Just a teeny weeny bit of your love
Turn your lights down low
And honey slip me a kiss, right now
Turn your lights down low baby
Turn it all down, ooh I just can't resist, oh no
Just a eeny weeny bit
Just a teeny weeny bit of your love
Oh, please right now, oh
All I want is a little bit honey
Please, please baby just gimme a little bit
I don't want it all, oh no no
Just a teeny weeny bit now
I want you forever not just for peace of mind
Please, please say you never leave me baby
Not till the end of time
Oh gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Just a eeny weeny bit
Just a teeny weeny bit of your love
And oh gimme a teeny weeny bit of your love baby
I don't want it all no no
Oh I just want a little bit
I just want a little bit of your love
Gimme a teeny weeny bit, a little taste
A little bit of taste of your loveEmbed
