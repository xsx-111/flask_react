The Same Rope LyricsJust because you are riddin high
And doing good for yourself
You want to smile and wave goodbye
And give your love to someone else
Uhun
One day just wait and see
You’re gonna be hurt just like me
You know you are wrong
But ahead on
I don’t think it will be long before she will be gone
And i'm willing to set you free
If you avoid her company
I believe that the...(same rope)
That pulls you (up up)
I said the (same rope)
That pulls you (up up)
I believe the same rope that pull you up
Sure can hang you
One day she will get tired of you
The way that you got tired of me ..ohh yeah
You will see what i'm going through
When you’re alone and in misery ..ohh yeah
I hate to say i told you so
So you better think before you go
I think you are such a full
For making such a move
Nobody else would do the things i've done for you
And i'm willing to set you free
If you take this.. this tip from me
I believe that the (same rope)
That pulls you (up up)
I said the (same rope)
That pulls you (up up)
The same rope that pull you up
Sure can hang you
You the we week may same day be strong
(oohh I will I know)
Never could do nobody wrong
I found out a long time ago
I believe the same rope (the same rope)
That pulls you (up up)
Is gonna hang you
(the same rope)Embed
