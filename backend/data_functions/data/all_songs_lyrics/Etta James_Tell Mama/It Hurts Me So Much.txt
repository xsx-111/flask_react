It Hurts Me So Much Lyrics
Baby, baby, baby
You know I love you
And I know you could love me, too, oh
But you can't let yourself be unfaithful
Oh, you can't let yourself be untrue
And oh, oh
If I thought it would make just a little bit of difference now
I'd gladly get down on my knees, yes, I would
Oh, but I might as well make myself face it
Oh, I know that you'll never, you'll never belong to me
Oh, oh

That's why it hurts me so much
It hurts me so much
To be unable to look
When you know that you can't touch, oh, oh

The best thing to do
Is to try to be stronger
Push my heart out of the way
And I can't let it linger on any longer, no, oh
The game, the game is getting too rough, too rough to play
Oh, oh, oh
That's why it hurts me so much
It hurts me so much
It hurts, it hurts me so much
No, don't let it hurt me so much
Ooh, it hurts...Embed
