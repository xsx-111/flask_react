Tell Mama Lyrics
You thought you had found a good girl
One to love you
And give you the world
Now you find that
You been misused
Talk to me
I'll do what you choose
I want you to

Tell Mama
All about it
Tell Mama
What you need
Tell Mama
What you want and
I'll make everything all right

That girl you had
Didn't have no sense
She wasn't worth
All the time you spent
She had another man
Throw you outdoors
Now the same man
Is wearing your clothes
I want you to

Tell Mama
All about it

She would embarrass you anywhere
She let everybody
Know she didn't care
Give me a chance
I've been begging you
I just wanna take care of you

I want you to
Tell Mama
All about it
Tell Mama
What you need
Tell Mama
What you want
Tell Mama
What you want right now
Tell me
Tell your Mam... 
Tell your Mama
What you got to haveEmbed
