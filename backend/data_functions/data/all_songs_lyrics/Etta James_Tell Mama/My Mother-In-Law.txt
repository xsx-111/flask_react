My Mother-In-Law Lyrics
Woo

Sick and tired of your mother
Tellin' me what to do
She's always stickin' her nose in my business
It seems I married her instead of you

Oh, my mother-in-law (Mother-in-law)
Oh, she makes me sick (Mother-in-law)
Oh my mother-in-law (Mother-in-law)
I've got to get away from her quick now (Woo)
Got to get away from her quick (Yeah)

I've tried and tried to get along, but nothing I do is right
If she can't mind her business
I'm telling you what I'm gon' to do
I'm packing my bags and leaving tonight

Oh, my mother-in-law (Mother-in-law)
Oh, she makes me scream, oh-ooh-hoo (Mother-in-law)
Oh, my mother-in-law (Mother-in-law)
It's worse than a horrible dream now (Woo)
Oh yeah, she's worse than a horrible dream (Yeah)
Woo
Somebody's got to go (It won't be me)
It's either her or me (It won't be me)
I'm sick and tired of your mother
There's not enough room for us three

Oh, my mother-in-law (Mother-in-law)
Oh, she worries me so (Mother-in-law)
Ooh, ooh, my mother-in-law now
You know she's got to go now (Woo), ooh yeah
You know she's got to go (Yeah)

Oh, my mother-in-law
(Mother-in-law, mother-in-law)
Oh, she worries me so
(Mother-in-law, mother-in-law)
She drinks all of my booze
(Mother-in-law)Embed
