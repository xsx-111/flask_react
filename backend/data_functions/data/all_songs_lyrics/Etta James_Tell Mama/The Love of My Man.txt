The Love of My Man Lyrics
The love of my man
Keeps me safe and warm
The love of my man
Protects me, protects me from all harm
'Cause I know, I know he loves me
And I love him so, yes, I do

And oh, the love, the love, the love of my man
(The love of my man, ooh-ooh)
It makes my whole life, makes my whole life worth living
(The love of my man, ooh-ooh)
The love of my man
Makes me feel, makes me feel just like, just like giving
Giving, yeah
And when his lips, and when his lips touch mine
It gives me, gives me, gives me a feeling so divine
Yes, it does

When he goes away (Yeah, yeah)
I'm never, never lonely (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know he thinks of me
He thinks of me, he thinks of me only, yes, he does
(Yeah, yeah)
But I'll go on loving him
I'll go on loving him anyway
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, the love, the love, the love
The love, the love, the love of my man
(The love of my man, ooh-ooh)
Oh, early in the morning
I like to talk about the love of my man
(The love of my man, ooh-ooh)
Late in the evening
In the wee hours of the morning
I like to talk about the love of my man
(The love of my man, ooh-ooh)Embed
