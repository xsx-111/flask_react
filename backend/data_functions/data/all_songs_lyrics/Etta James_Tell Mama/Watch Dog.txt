Watch Dog LyricsMy man is a watch dog
My man is a watch dog, yeah
I don't want no watch dog, I want a man, uh-huh
I don't want no watch dog, I want a man right now
I don't want no man of mine
Everywhere I go, now, he's a-right behind
I don't want no watch dog, I want a man
Every time I visit my girlfriend's house
He sends his baby brother to check me out
I go outside to sweep in my front yard
He stands over me like a prison guard
I've never seen a man sneaking and a-hiding
When he should be out working and providing
He's a watch dog
Yeah, he's a watch dog
We go out to party on a Saturday night
You're so jealous you start a fight
I'm asked to dance, you almost die
You watch over me like the FBI
I've never seen a man sneaking and a-hiding
When he should be out working and providing
You're a watch dog, yeah
My man is a watch dog

I'm never gonna lie
I never did cheat
I'm in this with you for my best years
When a man accuses you of somebody else
He's trying to cover up for what he's doing himself
He's a watch dog, yeah
The man is a watch dog
He's a hound dog
He's a snooping dog
He's a nosy nosy hound dogEmbed
