Age LyricsI've been up and down and around and 'round and back again
I've been so many places I can't remember where or when
And my only boss was the clock on the wall and my only friend
Never really was a friend at all
I've traded love for pennies, sold my soul for less
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time
I've turned inside out and around about and back and then
Found myself right back where I started again
Once I had myself a million, now I've only got a dime
The diff'rence don't seem quite as bad today
With a nickel or a million, I was searching all the time
For something that I never lost or left behind
I've traded love for pennies, sold my soul for less
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time
I've turned inside out and around about and back and then
Found myself right back where I started again
And Now I'm in my second circle and I'm headin' for the top
I've learned a lot of things along the way
I'll be careful while I'm climbin' 'cause it hurts a lot to drop
When you're down nobody gives a damn anyway
I've traded love for pennies, sold my soul for less
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time
I've turned inside out and around about and back and then
Found myself right back where I started againEmbed
