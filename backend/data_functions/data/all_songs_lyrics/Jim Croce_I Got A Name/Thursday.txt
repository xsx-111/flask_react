Thursday LyricsWell it started out just like a dream
And like a dream I knew that what we had
Would have to end
Cuz I was lookin' for a
Lifetime lover and
You were lookin' for a friend
Someone to be there
After all your night time lovers had gone
The way they came
Someone who knew the way
And helped to play your daytime game
It's not the same
Well I started out pretending that I'd
Come to mean enough to you to make
You want to change
Then I came to realize that
There was just too much of you you'd have
To rearrange
And I couldn't bear to wait around
For all your night time lovers to go
The way they came
And it came to hurt too much for me
To have to play your daytime games
No one's to blame
Well it started out just like a dream
And like a dream I knew that what we had
Would have to end
Cuz I was lookin' for a
Lifetime lover and
You were lookin' for a friend
I was lookin' for a
Lifetime lover and
You were lookin' for a friendEmbed
