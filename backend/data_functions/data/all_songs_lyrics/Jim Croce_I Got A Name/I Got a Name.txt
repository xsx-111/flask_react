I Got a Name Lyrics
Like the pine trees lining the winding road
I've got a name, I've got a name
Like the singing bird and the croaking toad
I've got a name, I've got a name

And I carry it with me like my daddy did
But I'm livin' the dream
That he kept hid

Movin' me down the highway
Rollin' me down the highway
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by

Like the north wind whistlin' down the sky
I've got a song, I've got a song
Like the whip-poor-will and the baby's cry
I've got a song, I've got a song

And I carry it with me and I sing it loud
If it gets me nowhere
I'll go there proud
Movin' me down the highway
Rollin' me down the highway
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by

1:38 - 2:00

And I'm gonna go there free

Like the fool, I am, and I'll always be
I've got a dream, I've got a dream
They can change their minds, but they can't change me
I've got a dream, I've got a dream

Oh, I know I could share it if you want me to
If you're goin' my way
I'll go with you

Movin' me down the highway
Rollin' me down the highway
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by
Movin' me down the highway
Rollin' me down the highway
Movin' ahead so life won't pass me by10Embed
