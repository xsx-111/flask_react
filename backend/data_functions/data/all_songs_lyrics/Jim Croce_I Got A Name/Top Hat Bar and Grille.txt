Top Hat Bar and Grille LyricsWell, if you're lookin' for a good time
Look hard as you want but you ain't gonna find
The kind of good times you will
Come every Friday and Saturday evening at the Top Hat Bar and Grill
Well, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill
There is a waitress name of Lil
Well, she's a honky tonky, little bit chunky, divorcee
She wears the tight hippy hugger slacks
You can believe me when I tell you jack
That she's a dancin', prancin', hard romancin'
P-I-E-C-E
And she can do the boogie woogie
She can do the boogaloo
And she can do the hoochie coochie
And she knows how to nasty too
So, if you're lookin' for a good time
Look hard as you want but you ain't gonna find
The kind of good times you will
Come every Friday and Saturday evening at the Top Hat Bar and Grill
Well, at the Top Hat Bar and Grill
They've got this bouncer name of Gil
Well, he's a honky tonky heavily funky ex-Marine
He wears the skin-tight body builder shirts
And jack he'll knock you out into the dirt
But, if you got you no money or you try to get funny
Then, brother you gonna see
That man's gonna do the boogie woogie
He gonna do the boogaloo
He gonna do the hoochie coochie
And he'll be doin' all his dancin' on you
So, if you're lookin' for a good time
Look hard as you want but you ain't gonna find
The kind of bad times you will
Come every Friday and Saturday evening at the Top Hat Bar and Grill
Lookin' for a good time
Lookin' for a bad time
So, if you're lookin' for a good time
The parties you want but you ain't gonna find
The kind of good times you will
Come every Friday and Saturday evening at the Top Hat Bar and GrillEmbed
