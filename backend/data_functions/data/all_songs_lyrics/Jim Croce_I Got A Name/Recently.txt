Recently LyricsUsed to be that I could see
A reason to be happy
'Cause I was free
But then, recently it seems
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to me
Used to be that I could pretend
That I wasn't really hurt back then
But then, recently it seems
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to me
'Cause
Mem'ries can be friends
Mem'ries can be friends
Or they can take you to a place
That you never thought you'd be again
And take you to a place
That you never ever thought
That you would see again
Doesn't matter now who was wrong
The future is tomorrow
'Cause the past is gone
And I'm findin' that I'm not as strong
As I thought that I used to be
'Cause, recently it seems
I've been lettin' your mem'ry get to meEmbed
