Go Down LyricsOne, two, three

Ruby, Ruby, where you been so long?
Done took to drinkin' whiskey
Baby, since you been gone
Ain't no one I know, do it good as you
Lickin' on that lickin' stick the way you do

You got the lips to make a strong man weak
And a heathen pray
You do it different, ain't the way you speak
No, that's just the way

You go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down

Mary, Mary, you're the one for me
And the way you hum, sting me like a bumble bee (zzz)
I'll be around to see you about, about half past ten
Ain't felt this good since, I don't know when
You got the touch that I need so much
In your finger tips
I got the honey that you love to taste
On those lovely lips
So...

Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down


Ooh baby, rub it on
Oh, it's sticky and it's sweet
And it's, it's been so long
Ain't no else got a touch like you
I let you doing things to me I let no other woman do
Ooh, it feels good
Oh feels good
Oh yeah
Oh, you do it like you should
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh yeah, yeah
I love you so much
Make me so glad I'm a man

You go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down
You go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down
You go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Go down, you go down, go down2Embed
