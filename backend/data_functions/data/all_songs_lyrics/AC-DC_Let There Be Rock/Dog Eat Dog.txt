Dog Eat Dog Lyrics
Well it's a dog eat dog
Eat cat, too
The French eat frog
An' I eat you
Business man, when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust?
Do you sign your life away?
Do you write your name in dust?

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog
Read the news
Someone win
Someone lose
Up's above and down's below
And limbo's in between
Up, you win
Down, you lose
It's anybody's game
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Woof!


And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie; that's the truth
See the blind man on the street
Lookin' for something free
Hear the kind man ask his friend
"Hey, what's in it for me?"

Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has his day

It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog1Embed
