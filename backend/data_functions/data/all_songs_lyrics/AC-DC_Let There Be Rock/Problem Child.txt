Problem Child LyricsCop this

I'm hot
And when I'm not, I'm cold as ice
Get out my way
Just step aside, or pay the price

What I want, I take
What I don't, I break
And I don't want you
With a flick (of) my knife
I can change your life
There's nothing you can do

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild

Make my stand, no man's land
On my own
Man in blue, it's up to you
The seed is sown
What I want, I stash
What I don't, I smash
And you're on my list
Dead or alive
I got a .45
And I never miss

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
Just runnin' wild

Just watch your step

Every night
Street alight
I drink my booze
Some run, some fight
But I win, they lose
What I need, I like
What I don't, I fight
And I don't like you
Say, "Bye, bye" while you're still alive
Your time is through

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild
I'm a problem child (and my mother hates me)
You've got your troubles, I've got mine11Embed
