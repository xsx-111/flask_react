My Love Paramour LyricsTwo different fates
My love paramour ooze out and away
Two different fates
My love paramour ooze out and away
Two different fates
Then fig up my love ooze out and away
Fig fig fig
Paramour ooze out and away onehow
Love if it’s warmer than this
Must ooze still out and away onehow
Love if it’s warmer than this
Must ooze still out and away onehow
Two different fates of my love paramour
Ooze out and away onehow
Love if it’s warmer than this
Must ooze still out and away onehow
Two different fates of my love paramour
Ooze out and away onehow
Fig fig fig
Paramour ooze out and away onehowEmbed
