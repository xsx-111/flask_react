When Mama Was Moth LyricsSunburst and snowblind
I steal the clue and write it down in my book
When mama was green and a whitewashed blue
Shivers and start screaming to rage in vain
The sunburst and the snowblind
I steal the clue and write it down in my book
When mama was moth, I took bulb form
My body electric will writhe in vain
My blue light trick (my blue light trick)
My blue light trick (my blue light trick)
My blue light trick (my blue light trick)
My blue light trick (my blue light trick)
My blue light trick (my blue light trick)
My blue light trick (my blue light trick)
My blue light trickEmbed
