The Tinderbox (Of a Heart) LyricsBrowbeaten
You’d be ...
Danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be ...
Danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
(How heavy you are when you’re split in half)
You’d be in danger then
(Tinderbox of heart left a shell is all)
Ruby is browbeaten
(How heavy you are when you’re split in half)
You’d be in danger then
(Tinderbox of heart left a shell is all)
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You’d be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
(Ruby, I see you)
You'd be in danger then
(You stay, stay lost)
Ruby is browbeaten
(Ruby, lost love)
You'd be in danger then
(You’ve got you...)
Not quick with your feet (Ruby is)
But you ran to the edge (browbeaten)
So bloody and blunt (you’d be)
Your big crystal eyes (in danger then)
How heavy you are (Ruby is)
When you’re splitting in half (browbeaten)
Tinderbox of a heart (you’d be)
Left a shell is all (in danger then)
Ruby is browbeaten
You'd be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You'd be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You'd be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You'd be in danger then
Not quick with your feet (Ruby is)
But you ran to the edge (browbeaten)
So bloody and blunt (you’d be)
Your big crystal eyes (in danger then)
How heavy you are (Ruby is)
When you’re splitting in half (browbeaten)
Tinderbox of a heart (you’d be)
Left a shell is all (in danger then)
Ruby is browbeaten
You'd be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You'd be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You'd be in danger then
Ruby is browbeaten
You'd be in danger thenEmbed
