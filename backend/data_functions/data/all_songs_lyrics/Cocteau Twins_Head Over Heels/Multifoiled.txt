Multifoiled LyricsNo longer multicoloured, multifoiled
No longer multicoloured, multifoiled
I'm multifoiled
And time opens wounds, yes
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled
More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled
Years were filled again
And time opens wounds, yes
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled
More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiled
More worthless love, for I'm all lackluster
I'm no longer multicoloured, I'm just multifoiledEmbed
