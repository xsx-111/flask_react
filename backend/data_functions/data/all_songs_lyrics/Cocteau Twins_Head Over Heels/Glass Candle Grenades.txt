Glass Candle Grenades LyricsThere’s only a hair’s breadth between us
Askew as we are
Askew as we are
There’s only a hair’s breadth between us
There’s only a hair’s breadth between us
Askew as we be
Askew as we be
There’s only a hair’s breadth between us
Glass sandstorms
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
Glass candle
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
Grenades are popping
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
There’s only a hair’s breadth between us
Askew as we are
Askew as we are
There’s only a hair’s breadth between us
There’s only a hair’s breadth between us
Askew as we be
Askew as we be
There’s only a hair’s breadth between us
Glass sandstorms
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
Glass candle
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
Grenades are popping
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
Glass sandstorms
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
Glass candle
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
Grenades are popping
Still we’ll not keel over, keel over, keel over
Keel overEmbed
