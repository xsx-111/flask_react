Five Ten Fiftyfold LyricsWheezing and sneezing
Tenfold it blew apart
It halved it in half
With gashing gust wind
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold
Wheezing and sneezing
It halved it in half
Five ten fiftyfold
With gashing gust wind
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold
Wheezing and sneezing
Tenfold it blew apart
With gashing gust winter
Just up north
Wheezing and sneezing
It halved it in half
Five ten fiftyfold
With gashing gust wind
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold
Five ten fiftyfold
Wheezing and sneezing
Tenfold it blew apart
With gashing gust winter
Just up north
Wheezing and sneezing and
Sneezing and wheezing and
Sneezing and sneezing and
Wheezing and sneezing and
Sneezing and wheezing and...
