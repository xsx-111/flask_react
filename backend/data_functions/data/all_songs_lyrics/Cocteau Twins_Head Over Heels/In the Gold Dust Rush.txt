In the Gold Dust Rush LyricsHer honey mouth has got me awful bored
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
In the gold dust rush I'd only genuflect
In the gold dust rush I'd only genuflect
In the gold dust rush I'd only genuflect
Honey is heartbroke
There's roses in May
She's got me awful bored
Honey is heartbroke
There's roses in May
She's got me awful bored
She's got me awful bored
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
In the gold dust rush I'd only genuflect
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
In the gold dust rush I'd only genuflect
Her honey mouth has got me awful bored
Honey is heartbroke
There's roses in May
She's got me awful bored
Honey is heartbroke
There's roses in May
She's got me awful boredEmbed
