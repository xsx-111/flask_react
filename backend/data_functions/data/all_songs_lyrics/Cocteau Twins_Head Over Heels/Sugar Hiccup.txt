Sugar Hiccup LyricsSugar hiccup, hiccup
Sugar hiccup
Make the earth toss and tumble
Sugar hiccup
Heavens curtsy and bow
Sugar hiccup
Make it pitch sough and swoon
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup, hiccup
Sugar hiccup
Make the earth toss and tumble
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup
Heavens curtsy and bow
Sugar hiccup
Make it pitch sough and swoon
Sugar hiccup
Heavens curtsy and bow
Make it pitch sough and swoon now
Sugar hiccup as she reels
Sugar hiccup, hiccup now
Sugar hiccup, hiccup
Make the earth toss and tumble
Sugar hiccup as she reelsEmbed
