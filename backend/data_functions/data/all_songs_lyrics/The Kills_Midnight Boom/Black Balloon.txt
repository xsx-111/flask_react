Black Balloon Lyrics
Elevator straight into my skull
The escalator rises as it falls
I swear our jet is crashing in my mind
You can hold on but I wouldn't waste your time

Farewell my black balloon
Farewell my black balloon

I've stood in a thousand street scenes
Just around the corner from you
On the edge of a dream that you have
Has anybody ever told you, it's not coming true?

Farewell my black balloon
Farewell my black balloon
Let the weather have its way with you
Farewell my black balloon
Let the weather have its way with you
Farewell my black balloon
Aaaa
Aaaaaa
Aaaaa
Aaaaaaa
Aaaa
Aaaaaa
Aaaaa
Aaaaaaaa

Farewell my black balloon
Farewell my black balloon
Let the weather have its way with you
Farewell my black balloon
Let the weather have its way with you
Farewell my black balloon
Let the weather have its way with you
Farewell my black balloon
Let the weather have its way with you
Farewell my black balloon1Embed
