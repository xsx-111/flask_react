Cheap and Cheerful Lyrics
I'm bored of cheap and cheerful
I want expensive sadness
Hospital bills, parole
Open doors to madness

I want you to be crazy
Cause you're boring baby when you're straight
I want you to be crazy
Cause you're stupid baby when you're sane

I'm sick of social graces
Show your sharp tipped teeth
Lose your cool in public
Dig that illegal meat
Cause love is just a dialogue
You can't survive on ice-cream
You got the same needs as a dog

It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
I want you to be crazy
Cause you're boring baby when you're straight
I want you to be crazy
Cause you're stupid baby when you're sane

It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)
It's alright (it's alright)
To be mean (to be mean)

I want you to be crazy
Cause you're boring baby when you're straight
I want you to be crazy
Cause you're stupid baby when you're sane
I want you to be crazy
Cause you're boring baby when you're straight
I want you to be crazy
Cause you're stupid baby when you're sane2Embed
