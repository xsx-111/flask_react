Hook And Line Lyrics
With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I'm still blown away
With your hook and line I still blow away

Try your best in your heavy shade
Keep it quiet, keep it cool
Lipstick letters and souvenirs
Make a mockery of your fears

With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I'm still blown away
With your hook and line I still blow away

Try your best to make it matter
Tattoo it in the clouds above you
Nail it down with jealous bolts
'Til it goes like a feather off on its own

With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I'm still blown away
With your hook and line I still blow away
A pawn
A shove
An eerie love
A whip
A crack
You won't come back

With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I'm still blown away
With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I still blow away
With your hook and line I'm still blown away
With your hook and line I still blow awayEmbed
