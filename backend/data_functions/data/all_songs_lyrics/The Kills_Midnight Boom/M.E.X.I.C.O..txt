M.E.X.I.C.O. Lyrics
Running into trouble
Running into trouble
You got heavenly eyes
Thousand highs
Always on a mission
It's not loving, it's not kissing
It's the heavenly ride
You still got wheels, kid
If I go missing
Don't you worry for me
I'm just writing
My side of the story
Just like Jackie
I'm biting my lips
Scoring my mind
Forever I find
Going down the coast of
M.E.X.I.C.O. - see you
I'm going down the coast of
M.E.X.I.C.O. - see you
Going down the coast of
M.E.X.I.C.O. - see youEmbed
