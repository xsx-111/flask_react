Night Train Lyrics
Sleep tight on the night train, no pain
I don't remember
Won't a couple of years do some good for you
No, your eyes
Got bigger

All my lovers take the train
All my lovers, all my love
All my lovers take the train
All my lovers, all my love

Sleep tight on the night train, no pain
I don't remember
Won't a couple of years do some good for you
No, your eyes
Got bigger

All my lovers take the train
All my lovers, all my love
All my lovers take the train
All my lovers, all my love, yeah
All my lovers take the train
All my lovers, all my love
All my lovers take the train
All my lovers, all my loveEmbed
