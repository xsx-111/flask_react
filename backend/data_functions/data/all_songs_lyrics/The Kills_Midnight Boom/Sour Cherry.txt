Sour Cherry Lyrics
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Cause it crossed my mind
It crossed my mind
Made my blood thump 7-8-9
Make my heart beat double time
Now I'm the only sour cherry on your fruit stand, right?
Am I the only sour cherry on the fruit stand?
Uh uh-uh-uh uh uh-uh uh-uh uh
Uh uh-uh-uh uh uh-uh uh

Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Shout when you wanna get off the ride
Cause it crossed my mind
It crossed my mind
I'm a penny in a diamond mine
We could be movers
We could be shakers
If we could just shake something out of the blue
And get off the ride

Now I'm the only sour cherry on your fruit stand, right?
Am I the only sour cherry on your fruit stand?
If I'm the only sour cherry on your fruit stand, right
Am I the only sour cherry on your fruit stand?
G-g-g-go home, go home it's over
G-g-g-go home it's over
G-g-g-go home, go home it's over
Go go home it's over
G-g-g-go home, go home it's over
Go go home it's over
G-g-g-go home, go home it's over
Go go home it's over
Now I'm the only sour cherry on your fruit stand
Am I the only sour cherry on your fruit stand?
Now I'm the only sour cherry on your fruit stand, right
Am I the only sour cherry on your fruit stand?
G-g-g-go home, go home it's over
G-g-g-go home it's over
G-g-g-go home, go home it's over
Go go home it's over
G-g-g-go home, go home it's over
Go go home it's over
G-g-g-go home, go home it's over
Go go home it's over1Embed
