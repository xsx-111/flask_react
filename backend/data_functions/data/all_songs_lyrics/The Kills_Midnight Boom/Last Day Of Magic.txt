Last Day Of Magic Lyrics
We're two parties, two parties ending
What if you move? What if you hide?
There's only so much you can miss
Before we both collide

My little tornado, my little hurricano
Last day of magic, where are you?
My little tornado, my little hurricano

We're two parties, two parties ending
I'll be the man with the broom
If you'll be the guts of the room
And there's only so much you can hide
Before I corner you

Last day of magic, where are you?
My little tornado, my little hurricano
Last day of magic, coming through
The eye of the storm, and I hold on to
My little tornado, my little hurricano

I'll be the man with the broom
If you'll be the dust of the room
And there's only so much you can hide
Before I corner you
Last day of magic, put a hole right through
The eye of the storm in a single room
My little tornado, my little hurricano
Cavalry come, cavalry go
Cavalry leave me alone
My little serinado, my little cococaino
Last day of magic, where are you?
My little tornado, my little hurricano1Embed
