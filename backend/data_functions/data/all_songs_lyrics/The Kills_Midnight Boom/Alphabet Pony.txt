Alphabet Pony Lyrics
He's the alphabet pony
He's the alphabet pony

Phoney monkey toy money
Lose end soda hands
Pink plastic Jesus on the dashboard
Just saying

He's the alphabet pony
Oh, he's the alphabet pony

No fun, not happy
Got no money, need a friend
A volcano dish on a mountain-top to live in

He's the alphabet pony
Oh, he's the alphabet pony
He's the alphabet pony
Oh, He's the alphabet pony, hey

Cancel Sunday, cancel Monday
Don't look at me
I been running on a no-tomorrow road at great speed
N-n-n-need a punch a pop, a bang, a different song
Like a nice new home needs a mean stray dog
Yeah, he's the alphabet pony
He's the alphabet pony
He's the alphabet pony
He's the alphabet pony

Oh we go up down, up down, up down town again
We like the walk, the talk don't stop
And fall into the quicksand
Sharp teeth dry heat
Can't breathe, too many sins
Don't forget my cigarettes
And get something that we can drink

He's the alphabet pony
Oh, he's the alphabet pony
He's the alphabet pony, hey
He's the alphabet ponyEmbed
