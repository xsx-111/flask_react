Goodnight Bad Morning Lyrics
The speed's working, I see it in everyone
Like a lost idea under light bulb sun
Your eyes are ready for take off
Melt in your head
What a beautiful state we are in
The jailors in my mind are all dead
I love you so much
Never forget
All of your secret
Are coming undone
What a beautiful state we are in

Goodnight another bad morning
Goodnight another bad morning
Goodnight another bad morning
Goodnight another bad morning
Goodnight (another bad)
Goodnight (another bad)
Goodnight (another bad)
Goodnight another bad morningEmbed
