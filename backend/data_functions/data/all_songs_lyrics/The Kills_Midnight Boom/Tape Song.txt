Tape Song Lyrics
You've got to ahh-ahh ahh-ahh
You've got to ahh-ahh ahh-ahh
You've got to ahh-ahh ahh-ahh
You've got to ahh-ahh ahh-ahh

Tape ain't gonna fix it honey
It ain't gonna stick
Tape ain't gonna fix it honey
It ain't gonna stick to you
Six kinds of glue
Won't hold you, won't hold you
Oh my oh, oh my
You've got to

You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
Time ain't gonna cure you honey
Time don't give a shit
Time ain't gonna cure you honey
Time's just gonna hit on you
I said, time ain't gonna cure you honey
Time don't give a shit
Time ain't gonna cure you honey
Time's just gonna hit on you
You got to

You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
Ah-huh, ah-huh, ah-huh

Time ain't gonna cure you honey
Time don't give a shit
Time ain't gonna cure you honey
Time's just gonna hit on you
I said, six kinds of blue
Won't hold you, won't hold you
Oh my oh, oh my you've got to
You've got to, you've got to
You got to go steal ahead
Go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead
You got to
You got to go steal ahead1Embed
