Turn It On Lyrics
Reach into to another day
And the world is just one step away
Making money living blind
It's time to change, leave it all behind

Turn it on, whenever you can
Turn it on, you know that you can

Hear the echoes in your heart
Tune your minds in then make a start
Anything you want to be
Will soon become reality
Then you'll see

Turn it on, whenever you can
Turn it on, you know that you can

You're out of touch, so turn it up
You don't need much to burn it up

Take a different point of view
And discover just what you can do
Getting closer every day
Now the world is just a step away (don't delay)
Turn it on, whenever you can
Turn it on, you know that you can

You hit the top, so turn it up
You'll never stop, just burn it up

Turn it on (turn it on), whenever you can
Turn it on (groovin' on), you know that you can
Turn it on (turn it on, yeah), whenever you can
Turn it on (movin' on), you know that you can
Turn it on (4x)Embed
