Love Games Lyrics
As I watch your face
I can see my life go by
You mean everything to me
Just can't take no more
Throw a smile my way
And the pain I feel inside
Turns to love for you
And I'm yours

Do lovers ever need to hide
The things they really feel inside
I simply need you to need me
Can't you see

Once I hoped to be
Your lover and your friend
But it turned into a game
I won't play no more
I believe I'm right
When I say you loved me too
It just can't go on
Your love games
Your love games
Do lovers ever need to hide
The things they really feel inside
If you won't show your heart to me
Set me free

Now the time has come
To show you how I feel
The love I gave to you
I can't give no more
Even now I see
The salt tears in your eyes
But it can't go on
Your love games
Your love games

Your love games
Your love games
Your love gamesEmbed
