Why Are You Leaving? Lyrics
Tell me why are you leaving
When there's no place to go
What's this secret you're keeping
You don't want me to know
Only lies need defending
'Cos the truth stands by itself
It's time for honesty
I can see, there's someone else

When the dawn breaks tomorrow
Will your whole life been changed
Are you sure all this sorrow
Won't just flood back again
Some strange dream you've been chasing
It's just another rainbow's end
You won't find it there, not anywhere
So why pretend

Tell me why are you leaving
All the things that you know
If it's dreams you believe in
Just how far can you go
If you leave, what's the answer
Perhaps some other sad affair
Won't you change your mind
Take some time - and I'll be there
(I'll be there)Embed
