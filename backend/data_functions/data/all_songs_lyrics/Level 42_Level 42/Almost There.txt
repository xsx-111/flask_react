Almost There Lyrics
Watch the paper window, see the stars
News and views to show you who you are
Keep the money moving change the scene
Open up the market with our dreams

Almost there, you and I
Catch the fall, touch the sky
Love a lot, paper view
Now's the time, make your move

Keep the money moving
As long as we are using
Almost without knowing
Getting ego's burning
Freightend they stop turning
See the judge adjourning
Play your part and don't get in their way

Black and White, they say you must believe
Now they found a sound that we obey
If you wait to long the tide will turn
Then there'll be some brand new rules to learn
Almost there, you and I
Catch the fall, touch the sky
Love a lot, paper view
Now's the time, make your move

Read a million pages
Every headline ages
Nothing ever changes
There's a time for laughing
Time will soon be passing
Make your mark before you fade awayEmbed
