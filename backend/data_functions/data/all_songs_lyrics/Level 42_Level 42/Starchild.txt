Starchild Lyrics
When I was an infant in my mothers arms
I would watch the starlight in her face
'Cause I was reaching out to understand the cosmic charm
I am just a starchild born in space

Way up high above the sky all that beauty passes by
Whole worlds still unknown
And out beyond the blue there's a place for people too
It's time for us to go

I have seen the sun shine bright in paradise
I have been there, I have seen it
Everywhere space people stare through ageless eyes
I have seen them, I believe it

Way up high above the sky all that beauty passes by
Whole worlds still unknown
And out beyond the blue there's a place for people too
It's time for us to go

We have time (In my dreams)
Time and space
While we're young (Floating free)
We can chase
The stars
Searching for the magic in the universe
Guided by the stars that light my way
I have seen the sun shine bright in paradise
I am just a starchild born in space

If you want to go with me I'll take you there
I've been shown these secrets face to face
I have seen the sun shine bright in paradise
I am just a starchild born in space1Embed
