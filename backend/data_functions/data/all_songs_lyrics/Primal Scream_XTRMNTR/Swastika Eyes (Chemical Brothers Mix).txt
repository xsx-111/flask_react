Swastika Eyes (Chemical Brothers Mix) Lyrics
Your soul don't burn, you dark the sun
Rain down fire on everyone
Scabs, police, government thieves
Venal psychic amputees
Parasitic your syphilitic
Parasitic your syphilitic

Swastika eyes
You got swastika eyes
You got swastika eyes
Swastika eyes, swastika eyes

Vent my spleen, I'll keep my dreams
My flesh, my bones, my soul I own
My mind's a weapon, immune from infection
Blood in my eyes, my vision is clear
Parasitic your syphilitic
Parasitic your syphilitic

Swastika eyes
You got swastika eyes
You got swastika eyes
Swastika eyes, swastika eyes
I see your autosuggestion psychology, elimination policy
A military, industrial illusion of democracy
I see your autosuggestion psychology, elimination policy
A military, industrial illusion of democracy

Swastika eyes, swastika eyes
Swastika eyes, swastika eyes
Swastika eyes, swastika eyesEmbed
