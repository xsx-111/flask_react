Accelerator Lyrics
He walks the streets full of dead meat
Through empty heads and cancelled eyes
Got a pain, I've got a hunger
Lord, my soul ain't satisfied

Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator

It ain't hard to be a sinner
Lord, it's hard to be a saint
Had a taste, you've had a glimmer
Start to shiver, can't be what you ain't

Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator, come on

Here we come, we're coming fast
All the others are in the past
Voices screaming in my head
Into the future, into the future
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator
Come on, come on
Hit the accelerator, the accelerator, come onEmbed
