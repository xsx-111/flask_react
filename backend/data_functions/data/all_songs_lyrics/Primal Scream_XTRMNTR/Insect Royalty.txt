Insect Royalty Lyrics
Few fateful violence, few reach the soul
Jagged metal, bad life, few reach the soul
I'm a host, I'm a host, I'm a host, I'm a host to the sucker disease
Parasites, parasites, parasites, parasites, parasites in me

Insect royalty live inside of me
Insect royalty live inside of me
Insect royalty bleed inside of me
Insect royalty bleed inside of me

Mess with the filth, you will get the disease
I know you die if you don't dream
Feel the heat, feel the heat, feel the heat, feel the heat, feel the heat in me
Demon seed, demon seed, demon seed, demon seed, demon seed in me

Insect royalty live inside of me
Insect royalty live inside of me
Insect royalty bleeding inside of me
Insect royalty bleeding inside of me

Insect, infect, insect, infect, insect, infect, insect
Insect, infect, insect, infect, insect, infect, insect
Insect, infect, insect, infect, insect, infect, insect
Insect, infect, insect, infect, insect, infect, insectEmbed
