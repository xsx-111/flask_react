Keep Your Dreams Lyrics
I believe that sinfulness
Can burn your soul away
There's no release from nothingness
When love has gone away

Stuck in acid, you will rust
Time will turn your bones to dust
I can muster, let her go
Keep your dreams, don't sell your soul
Be careful

I believe in forgiveness
Hate will eat you whole
Bad blood, a lifelong curse
You've got to let it go

Stuck in acid, you will rust
Time will turn your bones to dust
I can muster, let her go
Keep your dreams, don't sell your soul
Be careful
I'm going down to the underground
I'm going down to the underground
As deep as I can go
(I'm going down to the underground)
As deep as I can go
(I'm going down to the underground)
As deep as I can go
(I'm going down to the underground)
As deep as I can go
(I'm going down to the underground)
As deep as I can go
(I'm going down to the underground)
As deep as I can go
(I'm going down to the underground)
As deep as I can go
(I'm going down to the underground)Embed
