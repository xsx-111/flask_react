Kill All Hippies Lyrics
Hello, this is gorgeous, does anybody out there read me?
(10-4, I read you)
My handle's "gorgeous", pretty vacant, eh?
Subvert normality
Punk is not sexual, it's just aggression
10-4, old buddies, destroy, kill all hippies
Anarchy, disco sucks
Subvert normality
You got the money, I got the soul
You got the money, I got the soul
You got the money, I got the soul
I can't be bought, I can't be owned
You got the money, I got the soul
You got the money, I got the soul
I can't be bought, I can't be owned
You got the money, I got the soul
You got the money, you got the money
You got the money, I got the soul
I got the soul, I got the soul
I got the soul, I got the soul
