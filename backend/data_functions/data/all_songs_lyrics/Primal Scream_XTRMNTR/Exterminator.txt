Exterminator Lyrics
Gun metal skies, broken eyes
Claustrophobic concrete English high-rise
Exterminate the underclass, exterminate the telepaths

No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience

Incubating ultraviolence, psychic distortion
Slow death injectable, narcosis terminal
Damaged receptors, fractured speech

No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience

Control virus, hallucinatory programme
Septicaemic interzone, psychic distortion
Satellite sickness, TV junk

No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience

Insecticide shots for criminal cops
All jails are concentration camps, all judges are bought
Everyone's a prostitute, everyone's a prostitute

No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience

So look out, kid, they keep it all hid
You think you're free, but you ain't free, just free to be hit
You're an unchannelled frequency, nobody's listening
You're imbalanced permanent, nobody's listening

No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience

No civil disobedience
No civil disobedience
No civil disobedienceEmbed
