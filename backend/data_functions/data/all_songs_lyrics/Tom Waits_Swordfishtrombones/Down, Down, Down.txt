Down, Down, Down LyricsHe went down down down
And the devil called him by name
He went down down down
Hangin' onto the back of a train
He went down down down
This boy went solid down
Always chewed tobacco
And the bathtub gin
Always chewed tobacco
And the bathtub gin
He went down down down
This boy went solid down
He went down
Well he went down down down
And the devil jumped on his head
He went down down down
Stayin' in a broken down shed
He went down down down
Sleepin' in the devil's bed
He went down down down
Never listened to the words I said
He went down
Well he went down down down
And the devil said where you been
He went down down down
He screamin' down around the bend
Down down down
This boy went solid down
He was always cheatin'
And he always told lies
He was always cheatin'
And he always told lies
He went down down down
This boy went solid down
He went downEmbed
