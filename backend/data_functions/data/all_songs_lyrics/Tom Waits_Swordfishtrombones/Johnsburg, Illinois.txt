Johnsburg, Illinois LyricsShe's my only true love
She's all that I think of
Look here in my wallet
That's her
She grew up on a farm there
There's a place on my arm
Where I've written
Her name next to mine
You see I just can't live without her
And I'm her only boy
And she grew up outside McHenry
In Johnsburg, IllinoisEmbed
