Gin Soaked Boy LyricsI got a belly full of you and that Leavenworth stuff
Now I'm gonna get out and I'm gonna get tough
You've been lying to me, how could you crawl so low?
With some gin-soaked boy that you don't know
I come home last night full a fifth of Old Crow
You said you goin' to your Ma's, but where the hell did you go?
You went and slipped out nights, you didn't think that I'd know
With some gin-soaked boy that you don't know
Well I would bet you as far as Oklahoma by now
The dogs are barking out back and you're knittin' your brow
Well, I'm on your tail, I sussed your M.O
From some gin-soaked boy that you don't knowEmbed
