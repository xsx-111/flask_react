Nothing Is True LyricsYou get nothin' back for all you've saved
Just eternity in a spacious grave
She said, "Nothing is true, everything is permitted"
Things just go from bad to worse
Starts like a kiss and ends like a curse
But nothing's true, she said everything is permitted
She got jewels on her tongue to time the stars
She drives all morning in unmarked cars
But nothing's true, it is all permitted
She got these special tools just to keep things tight
They robbed her eyes long ago of light
But nothing's true, she told me it's all permitted
She got inscrutable poise and nihilist charms
She gets her sleep through tubes in her arm
She said nothing is true, she said everything is permitted
She nods on graves, the marble's cold and white
Her dreams surround the sun like a satellite
She said nothin' is true, she told me it's all permitted
The spiders milk her thigh, it does not phase her
She cleans her skin with a krypton laser
Nothing is true, everything is permitted
She got heels so high, she got a gown so thin
Her eyes stop the whip before it tames her sin
She says nothin' is true, everything is permitted
Until they perfect the techniques to clone
You all better remember you're all alone
Because nothing is true, she said everything is permittedEmbed
