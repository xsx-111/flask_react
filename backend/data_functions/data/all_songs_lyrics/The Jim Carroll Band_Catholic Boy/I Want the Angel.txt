I Want the Angel LyricsI want the angel
Whose dreams are fatal
They cause the snake's milk to run and curdle
I want the angel
Whose darkness doubles
It absorbs the brilliance of all my troubles
I want the angel
That will not shatter
Every time I whisper, "Girl it does not matter"
I want the angel
Who's got the proof
She signals her devotion from the rails on the roof
I want the angel
That comes to stay
She don't let lawyers and ambition lead her away
I want the angel
Whose eyes are raving
Who takes what I'm giving and not what I'm saving
I want the angel
Whose bones are so sharp
That they can break through their own excuses
Well, to be a blind man
Hey, that would be a fine thing
Then I could dream at night of total strangers
And all the music would be so spaceless
And all the women would be so faceless
They'd be so faceless they'd be like old film
Just like old film I never did process
I want the angel
That knows the sky
She got virtue, she got the parallel light in her eye
I want the angel
That's partly lame
She filters clarity from her desperate shame
I want the angel
That knows rejection
Who's like a whore in love with her own reflection
I want the angel
Whose touch don't miss
When the blood comes through the dropper like a thick red kiss
If I could break through I could be certain
But this obsession is like some fiery curtain
All the numbers reduced to zero
And those who died young, they are my heroes
They are my heroes, they took the walk
Where the heart made sense and the mind can't talk
I want the angel
Whose child don't weep
She's got dreams designed for eternal sleep
I want the angel
That will not change
Into a four-legged monster in love with the strange
I want the angel
That never chooses
And don't come running back every time she loses
But I want the angel that never losesEmbed
