Dreamers Lyrics
There's a place I know so well
Behind closed eyes, there's a pearl inside a shell
From time to time, I come to see
If this world still has a place for me
When I put my head to sleep
Take the rest my body needs
That's the time my mind is up and away

We are dreamers, all of our lives
We are dreamers, your dream will be mine
Forever, dream on dreamer

It doesn't matter where you're from
The door is open all the time for everyone
There's a place I know so well
Will I find you, only time will tell
Well it's been a long, long time
Since I've seen that state of mind
Right now my friend, I'm up and away


When I put my head to sleep
Take the rest my body needs
That's the time my mind is up and away

There's a place I know so well
Dream on dreamerEmbed
