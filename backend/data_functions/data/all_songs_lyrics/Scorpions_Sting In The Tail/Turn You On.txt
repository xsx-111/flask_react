Turn You On Lyrics
Yeah let's fly away from here
And scream if you like it
The world out there disappears
Tell me are you excited
So let's rattle and roll and shake
The sweat hits the ceiling
Tonight we will slip away
Just rocking and reeling
Beyond the point of no return
The fever's rising until we'll crash and burn
There's something in my veins that is thicker than blood
Nothing in the world this is all we've got

So come on
If you want to feel the sting
Come on come on come on come on
Come on baby shake that thing
I'm going to turn you on

Yeah let's celebrate all night
We're starting all over
You turn me into a wild
And hard Rock'n'Roller
Into the light out of the dark
A passion never known invades my heart
The universe is rocking like heaven and hell
If I'm coming back hard to tell
So come on
If you want to feel the sting
Come on come on come on come on
Come on baby shake that thing
Mama mama mama rock on
And let the show begin
I want to turn you on

So come on
If you want to feel the sting
Come on come on come on come on
Come on baby shake that thing
Mama mama mama rock on
And feel the sting
Come on come on come on come on
And let the show begin
I going to turn you on
I want to turn you onEmbed
