Miracle LyricsWe took the long way
The long way home
And now it's just one step to go
All those hours alone
With only thing to get me home
Will I get out of this?
And all that's left for me is hope
Now all I'm hoping for
Is a miracle (a miracle)
To see the daylight
A miracle
The sky so blue
It's a miracle (a miracle)
To find a new life
A miracle
To be back with you!
In the darkest hours
Alone with all your fears
All you can think of
Are those happy days
So much we take for granted
But life's a fragile thing these days
When the time is up
All you're hoping for
You're hoping for
Is a miracle (a miracle)
To see the daylight
A miracle
The sky so blue
It's a miracle (a miracle)
To find a new life
A miracle
To be back with you!
All I need
Is a miracle (a miracle)
To see the daylight
A miracle
The sky so blue
It's a miracle (a miracle)
To find a new life
A miracle
To be back with you!
To be back with you...(a miracle)
Just one more step
One more step...
One more step...
To be back with you...
To be back with you...Embed
