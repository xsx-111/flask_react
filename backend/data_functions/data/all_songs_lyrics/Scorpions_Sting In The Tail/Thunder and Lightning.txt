Thunder and Lightning Lyrics
I left you once you killed me twice
Seems like the devil rolled the dice
What have you done what can we do
To make it through
Remember when life was free
As free as our minds
Wounded hearts

Thunder and lightning in the heat of the night
Some lonely highway it's a hell of a ride
Turn it up to extreme let the engine scream
And leave it all behind
Thunder and lightning
In a stormy night

The gun was pointed to my head
You walked away and I was dead
In the name of love you've turned to dust
What I've called trust
Remember when we were young
And innocent too
The monsters stayed behind the walls
No fears at all
