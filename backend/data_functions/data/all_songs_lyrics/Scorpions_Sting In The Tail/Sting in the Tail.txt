Sting in the Tail Lyrics
Bang bang, rock with the gang
Bang bang, rock with the gang

Save me from myself before I'm going down
My world went kind of crazy spinning round and round
My body's in a mess from head to toe
Got nothing to lose and nowhere to go

Bang bang, rock with the gang
Bang bang, rock with the gang

I'm driving out of town just follow my heart
I think I'm gonna be a rock'n'roll star
The girls would go mad I'd give 'em all I can give
If I had a cheap guitar and one dirty riff

Yo yo, I gotta go
Here comes another show

Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Rocking night after night day after day
There's plenty of love and no escape
Life's screaming and rolling like a monster train
Destination nowhere, I won't be late

Yo yo, I gotta go
Here comes another show

Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail, hail hail a sting in the tail
Hail hail a sting in the tail, hail hail a sting in the tail

Bang bang, rock with the gang
Bang bang, rock with the gang
Bang bang, rock with the gang
Bang bang, rock with the gangEmbed
