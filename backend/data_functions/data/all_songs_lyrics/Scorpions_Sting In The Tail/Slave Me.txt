Slave Me Lyrics
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Life's a kind of struggle
Living in this town
I'm never looking back no
Just ahead
My mind was locked up in a cage
Always ready to break out
Those heavy chains on me drive me mad

I want to be in love tonight
I want to get you when I got you
Give me just one night
I want to be your love tonight
Slave me

Power's one that matters
Only one of us can survive
Tell me if your strong enough to stay on track
Will I die and go to heaven
If life was living hell
All I know is that I'm always coming back

Shake me
Bake me
Break me
Take me where the sun don't shine
Cruise me
Choose me
Use me
Bruise me
Make me lose my mind
I want to be in love tonight
Yeah yeah
Mamama, mamama, mamama, mamama
Slave me
Yeah yeah yeah


Yeah yeah yeah
Come on and slave meEmbed
