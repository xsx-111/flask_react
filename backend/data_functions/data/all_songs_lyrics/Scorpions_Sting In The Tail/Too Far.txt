Too Far Lyrics
I want to read in your eyes
That you mean yes when you say no
I want to take a step across that line
Until you can feel my love

You opened the door and it hits to the core

Ain't got no pearls or diamond rings
I only got my heartbeat
But it won't be long and I will win
And melt inside your heart


We went too far way too far
There's no turning back this time
We went too But you're going to be all mine


We went too far way too far
There's no turning back this time
We went too far way too far
But it's going to be alright
We went too far way too far
It can never be too far
We went too far way too far
To find nothing but real loveEmbed
