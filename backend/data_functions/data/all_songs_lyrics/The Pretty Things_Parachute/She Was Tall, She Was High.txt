She Was Tall, She Was High Lyrics
She was tall, she was high
Lord, she almost touched the sky
Today, I said today
She was tall, she was high
Lord, she almost made me cry
Today, she spends her time

Beside grey lakes of lead
She's harnessed to a kneeling form
Before the storm subsides, she's flown
And leaves the body torn
But she is free
F, R, double E

She was tall, she was high
Lord, she almost touched the sky
Today, I said today
She was tall, she was high, Lord
I'm telling you, she was touching the sky
(Almost made me cry)
Today, I said todayEmbed
