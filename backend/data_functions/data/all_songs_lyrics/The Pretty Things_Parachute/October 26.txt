October 26 LyricsSo
If we meet again
Then maybe
(Revolution)
(That's all that it can be)
(If you find your own solution)
(Then that's alright with me)
If I wanted to
Could I depend on you
My friend
So
If we dream again
Then maybe
(Revolution)
(That's all that it can be)
(If you find your own solution)
(Then that's alright with me)
If I wanted to
Could I depend on you
My friend
So
If we'd hope again
Then maybe
(Revolution)
(That's all that it can be)
(If you find your own solution)
(Then that's alright with me)
(Revolution)
(Can't you be revolution)
(That's all that it can be)
(Revolution)Embed
