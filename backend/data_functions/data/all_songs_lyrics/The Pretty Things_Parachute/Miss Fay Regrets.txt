Miss Fay Regrets LyricsYou're corrugated steel baby
Platinum to feel lady
Eyes are just two heavy stones
Someone, spilt the glass
And you're ageing much too fast
And, you say that you've been left alone
You're leant against the night
But you say you feel alright
Only somebody has stolen your home
The pearls around your neck
There at great expense were set
But your tangled hair resists the comb
No where to go now she has fallen
No one to come see her
For she was born to the screen
And as she performed
Their hearts really melted, Ahh ...
Sure I've seen your face before
But yes then there was a war
And depression left the world so flat
Yes, you were super-huge baby
Limousines you used
But your memory it clouds after that
You say what's this part of town
And yes it's a long way down
And you swear you didn't know it existed
You're from high on the hill
And the fact you're not there still
I would surely have killed you ninth husband
No where to go ...
Well could I spare the fare
'Cause your cheque book isn't there
Could I take you to where your hotel is
Oh yes I told them who you were
But they said they would prefer it
If you would find another place to crash in
I know the streets are very cold
And the shallow walls don't hold
The shelter and protection you're seeking
And as I walk away
You turn to me and say
You'd rather I forget about our meeting
No where to go now she has fallen ...Embed
