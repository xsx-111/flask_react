The Letter Lyrics
She wrote me a letter
From the green fields it came
She wrote me a letter
Trying to explain
Now living came easy
In velvet valleys of sun
She wrote me a letter

She wrote me a letter
So many questions she asked
She knew I just couldn't answer
For they were all in the past
City life was too heavy
So she had run for the hills
She wrote me a letter

She wrote me a letter
She wrote me a letter

In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
In the rainEmbed
