Rain Lyrics
When I got to our meeting place
I stared into empty space
No one here for me
Oh, no, no, no

(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
Nobody, nobody here for me
(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
Oh, no, no, no
(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
Nobody, nobody, nobody here for me
(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
No, no, no, no, no, nobody

(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
Nobody, nobody, nobody, oh, no, no, no
(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
Nobody here for me
Nobody, nobody here for me
(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
Oh, no, oh, no, no, no
(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody here for me
(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
I am so alone, oh, no, no, no
(Here in the rain, feeling uptight)
No, no, no, no, no, no...Embed
