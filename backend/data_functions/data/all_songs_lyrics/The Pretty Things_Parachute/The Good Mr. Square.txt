The Good Mr. Square Lyrics
The good Mr. Square
He doesn't have any hang-ups
He spends his time
Looking through other people's eyes
The good Mr. Square
He doesn't have any hang-ups
He spends his time
Looking through other people's lives
Oh, and how, inside
He likes the things that they've done
The good Mr. Square
He doesn't have any hang-ups
He spends his time

And as she weaves her way
Through city streets, the dawn arrives
In concrete glades of metal grass
Steel cords are woven tight
But she is free
