You and the Night and the Music LyricsYou and the night and the music
Fill me with flaming desire
Setting my being completely on fire
You and the night and the music
Thrill me but will we be one
After the night and the music are done?
^Until the pale light of dawning and daylight
Our hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning may come without warning
And take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love till the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you
(Rep from ^)
You and the night and the music
You and the night
YouEmbed
