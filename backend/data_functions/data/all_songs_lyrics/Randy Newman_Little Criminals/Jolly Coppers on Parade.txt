Jolly Coppers on Parade LyricsThey're comin' down the street
They're comin' right down the middle
Look how they keep the beat!
Why, they're as blue as the ocean!
How the sun shines down!
How their feet hardly touch the ground!
Jolly coppers on parade
Here come the black-and-whites
Here come the motorcycles
Listen to those engines roar!
Now they're doin' tricks for the children
Oh, they look so nice!
Looks like angels have come down from Paradise!
Jolly coppers on parade
Oh, mama!
That's the life for me!
When I'm grown
That's what I want to be
They're comin' down the street
They're comin' right down the middle
Look how they keep the beat!
Comin' through the heart of the city
Oh, it's all so nice!
Just like angels have come down from Paradise!
