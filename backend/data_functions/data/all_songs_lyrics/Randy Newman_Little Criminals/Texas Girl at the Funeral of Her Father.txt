Texas Girl at the Funeral of Her Father LyricsHere I am lost in the wind
Round in circles sailing
Like a ship that never comes in
Standing by myself
Sing a sad song for a good man
Sing a sad song for me
Sing a sad song for the sailor
A thousand miles from the sea
Here I am alone on the plain
Sun's going down
It's starting to rain
Papa, we'll go sailingEmbed
