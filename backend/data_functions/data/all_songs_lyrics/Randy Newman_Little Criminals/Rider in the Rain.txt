Rider in the Rain LyricsGot a gun in my holster
Got a horse between my knees
And I'm goin' to Arizona
Pardon me, boys, if you please
I have been a desperado
Raped and pillaged 'cross the plain
Now, I'm goin' to Arizona
Just a rider in the rain
He's a rider in the rain
He's a rider in the rain
And I'm goin' to Arizona
He's a rider in the rain
Oh, my mother's in St. Louis
And my bride's in Tennessee
So, I'm goin' to Arizona
With a banjo on my knee
He's a rider in the rain
He's a rider in the rain
And I'm goin' to Arizona
He's a rider in the rain
Used to work in uncle's feed store
While he was fightin' in the war
Now I'm goin' to Arizona
Ain't gonna work for him no more
I'm the son of the prairie
And the wind that sweeps the plain
So, I'm goin' to Arizona
Just a rider in the rain
He's a rider in the rain
He's a rider in the rain
And I'm goin' to Arizona
He's a rider in the rain
He's a rider in the rain
He's a rider in the rain
And I'm goin' to Arizona
Just a rider in the rainEmbed
