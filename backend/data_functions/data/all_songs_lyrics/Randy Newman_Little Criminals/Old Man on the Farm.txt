Old Man on the Farm LyricsHe's waitin for some rain to fall
He's waitin for some mail to come
He's waitin for the dawn again
Old man on the farm
Milk the cow -- slop the pigs
Sweeping out the chicken-house
Drinking whiskey in the barn
Goodnight ladies
Sorry if I stayed too long
So long it's been good to know you
I love the way I sing that song
So long it's been good to know you
I love the way I sing that songEmbed
