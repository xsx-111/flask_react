Little Criminals LyricsWhat you wanna come back here for?
Thought you're with your uptown friends
Don't need none of your junkie business
You gonna screw us up again
Get your blackjack off my table
Get your coat out of my rack
We don't need you round here, jerk-off
Chuck, I want you off my back
Cause we've almost made it
We've almost made it
We've almost made it to the top
Got a gun from Uncle Freddy
Got a station all picked out
Got a plan and now we're ready
Gonna take that station out
So you go about your business
You just leave us folks alone
We don't need no two-bit junkie
Screwin up our happy home
Cause we've almost made it
We've almost made it
We've almost made it to the topEmbed
