Kathleen (Catholicism Made Easier) Lyrics
There is a courtyard here in Chicago
Down by the river where no one goes
We could be married there in the courtyard
By this old Spanish priest that no one knows
He'll say, "Nel blu, dipinto, dipinto di blu
Felice de stare, di stare lassu"
That means you love him and he loves you
"Piu bel ci sono, ci sei tu"

Kathleen, Kathleen, Kathleen
You're the best one in the world
Kathleen, Kathleen, Kathleen
I've always been crazy 'bout Irish girls
I've always been crazy 'bout Irish girls

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, come what may
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm gonna take you away, away
Kathleen, Kathleen, Kathleen
I've searched through all the world
I dream of you, Kathleen
I've always been crazy 'bout Irish girls
I've always been crazy 'bout Irish girls
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
“Nel blu, dipinto, dipinto di blu
Felice de stare, di stare lassu”
Means you love him and he loves you
“Piu bel ci sono, ci sei tu”…Embed
