Masculine Intuition LyricsShe cries like she means it and she does at the time
But I get too jumpy waiting for the next time
She's in a depression just about every day
She tells me she's happy but I feel there's no way
I've got a masculine intuition
And I do not never be wrong
I've got a masculine intuition
Whisperin'…keep comin' on strong
If i had a nickel I'd soon have a dime
And climb in a phone-booth and buy me some time
And we'll live in the kitchen and we'll sleep on the floor
With my intuition and the neighbors next door…
I've got a masculine intuition
And I do not never be wrong
I've got a masculine intuition
Whisperin'…keep comin' on strong
And keep your good time humor
A keep comin' on strong
Nothing else gets no newer…
The check's on the table and the pen's in your hand
And if that makes you happy then nothing else can
My mind's on the laundry while you sleep away
If I had the gumption I'd leave you today
I've got a masculine intuition
And I do not never be wrong
I've got a masculine intuition
