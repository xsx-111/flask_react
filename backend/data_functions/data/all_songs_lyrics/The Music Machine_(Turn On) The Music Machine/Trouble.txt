Trouble LyricsI've got things on my mind, yeah
Cobwebs in my brain
If you've got the time, yeah
Help me ascertain
How to rectify the
Growing mental pain
Of T-R-O-U-B-L-E , trouble-wow-wow-wow-wow
I can see the future
Looking back at it
If you've got a soul, then
Give me some of it
So I can learn to take in stride the problems that I have inside
Somewhere there's a place I fit
I can live with just a bit of
T-R-O-U-B-L-E , trouble-wow-wow-wow-wow
Everybody's got their trouble
Some can rise above it all
And every day my problems double
And I'm headed for a fall
Your deciding factor
Is one way I can win
But you've got to help me
Every inch of it
That's not to say don't bother me
Or blind me to reality
Take away my losing strength
And never be a troubled friend
T-R-O-U-B-L-E , trouble-wow-wow-wow-wowEmbed
