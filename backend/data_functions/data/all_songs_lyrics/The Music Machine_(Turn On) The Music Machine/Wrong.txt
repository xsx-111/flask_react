Wrong LyricsWrong
When you feel so much you're right
It's positively airtight
Just at the moment all your doubt is gone
You may discover that you're...
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!
And for your life, you don't know why
It's much too late and you're too old to cry
But you're wrong
And you're on the losing end
And the wrong's too wrong to mend
What to do? What to do?
Mistakes
Mistakes will come and go
First you're high and then you're low
You may be loving life and riding  along
But the people keep insisting you're...
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!
Every time you turn your head
Someone else is right instead
And you're wrong
Everything is going wrong
Everything is going wrong
What to do? What to do?!
Oh, oh
Hear me world, I'm right
Even so, I feel it's wrong
I can wait, but not for long
To get my thinking up to date
Oh, correction, I mean straight
From wrong
In the eyes of just myself!
Just like everybody else!
That's wrong!
That's wrong!
That's wrong!Embed
