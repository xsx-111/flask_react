Come on In LyricsCome on in, the water fine
Come on in, you’re just in time
Here’s the change you’ve often said so many times
Was never yours, oh how you cried
Now’s the time to break your leash
And show the world your apron strings have come untied
Come on in, don’t meditate
Come on in, why hesitate?
Don’t play with hopscotch with your life, you little fool
You can’t win a first prize that way
The steering wheel inside your head has come apart
But it’s no matter if you don’t delay and I say
Come on in, the open door
Come on in, don’t cry no more
Clean your house, unpack your mind and leave behind
The plastic mould you call your past
Show to me sincerity and everything that’s me
Belongs to you, but all I ask is
Come on in, across  the line
Come on in, the water’s fine
Come on in and show the world
The soul you never had
And tear away from dreams unborn
Shed the tears that make you sad
Come on in, don’t cry no more
Come on in, don’t cry no more
Come on in, and close the doorEmbed
