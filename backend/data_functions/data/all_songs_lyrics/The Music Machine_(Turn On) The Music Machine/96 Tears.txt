96 Tears LyricsToo many teardrops
For one heart to be crying, yeah
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
You're way on top now
Since you left me
You're always laughing
Way down at me
Well, you better watch out now
'Cause I, I'm gonna get down
And we'll be together
For just, just a little while
And then I'm gonna put you
Way, way down here
And you'll start crying, yeah
Ninety-six tears
Oh, cry now
When the sun comes up
I'll be on top
And you'll be right down there
A-looking up
And on my way
I'll come up here
But I don't see you
Waiting around
I'm on my way
Wondering how
I'm gonna get you
But I know now
I'll just cry
Cry
I'll just cry
Too many teardrops
For one heart to be crying, yeah
Too many teardrops
For one heart to carry on
And you're gonna cry
Ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry
Ninety-six tears
You're gonna cry
Cry cry cry
You're gonna cry
Cry cry cry
Oh, let me here you cry
Cry cry cry
Oh, let me here you cry
Ninety-six tears
Come on, let me see you Cry
Come on
Come onEmbed
