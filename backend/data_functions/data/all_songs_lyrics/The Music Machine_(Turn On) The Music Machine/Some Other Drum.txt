Some Other Drum LyricsHear the whistling song
Carry the hills rolling along
I would whistle the chant
I would if I could but I can't
And the wind is taking the song
Up through the trees singing it wrong
It would whistle the chant
It would if it could, but it can't
Everybody's singing their own song
Everybody's got their own plan
Some it seems are marching on time wrong
They're only hearing some other drum
So you see
Life's just a card
You play it right
Or you play it hard
It's a personal slant
I would if I could, but I can't
Everybody's singing their own song
Everybody's got their own plan
Some it seems are marching on time wrong
They're only hearing some other drum
So you see
Life's just a card
You play it right
Or you play it hard
It's a personal slant
I would if I could, but I can't
I would if I could, but I can't
I would if I could, but I can'tEmbed
