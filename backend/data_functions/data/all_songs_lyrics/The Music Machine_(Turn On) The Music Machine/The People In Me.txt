The People In Me LyricsHey, Halright
Sometimes dreamin'
I'm in here schemin' on you
Collectin' headers
With nothin' better to do
Memory is everywhere
Love and you is in my hair
And eyes
Maybe with the time and place
A look will come upon your face
Of surprise
When you see the people in me
Minus you what will you do
When you see the people in me
Minus you it's overdue
While I'm cryin
I'm rectifyin' the cause
Friends are cheerin'
And I'm hearin' applause
The train is here you better run
Don't call me I'll never come
Unto you
They're over now the games you play
Just what you'll do, just what you'll say
Uh oh you
— Middle —
Memory is everywhere
Love and you is in my hair
And eyes
Maybe with the time and place
A look will come upon your face
Of surprise
When you see the people in me
Minus you what will you do
When you see the people in me
Minus you it's overdue
Hut, HalrightEmbed
