Taxman LyricsLet me tell you how it will be
(Taxman)
There's one for you, nineteen for me
(Taxman)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five per cent appear too small
(Taxman)
Be thankful I don't take it all
(Taxman)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah yeah, I'm the taxman
(If you drive a car)
I'll tax the street
(If you try to sit)
I'll tax your seat
(If you get too cold)
I'll tax the heat
(If you take a walk)
I'll tax your feet
Taxman
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah yeah, I'm the taxman

Don't ask me what I want it for
(Oh, oh, Mr. Johnson)
If you don't want to pay some more
(Oh, oh, Mr. Ross)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah yeah, I'm the taxman
Now my advice for those who die
(Taxman)
Declare the pennies on your eyes
(Taxman)
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one else but me
Taxman
Taxman
Taxman
