Hey Joe LyricsHey Joe, where you goin’ with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, where you goin’ with that gun in your hand?
I'm gonna kill my woman
She's been seen with another man
I'm gonna kill my woman
She's been seen with another man
Hey Joe, do you think you'll ever die?
Hey Joe, now do you think you'll ever die?
I don't believe in money
Fortune, fame, or dirty lies
I don't believe in money
Fortune, fame, or dirty lies
Hey Joe,  tell me where you're gonna go?
Hey Joe,  tell me where, where you're gonna go?
I guess I'll take my life
Down in Mexico
I guess I'll take my life
Down in Mexico
Hey Joe, you can't die until your time
Hey Joe, oh, you can't die until your time
Death is the glove
That fits the hand of time
I say that death is the glove
That fits the hand of time
Hey Joe, hey
Hey Joe, hey, hey Joe
Too soon, I say it's too soon, too soon, too soon
Too soon, I say hey, hey JoeEmbed
