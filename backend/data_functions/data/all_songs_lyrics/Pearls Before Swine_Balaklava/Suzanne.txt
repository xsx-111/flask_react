Suzanne LyricsSuzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy but that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her that you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you think she'll really trust you for you've touched her perfect body with your mind
And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching from a lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said : 'All men shall be sailors then until the sea shall free them'
But he himself was broken long before the sky would open
And he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind
And you think you'll maybe trust him for he's touched your perfect body with his mind
Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night forever
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror
And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind
And you think you'll maybe trust her for she's touched your perfect body with her mind1Embed
