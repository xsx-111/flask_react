Images of April LyricsImages of April
Summer in the air
April in your hair
All is gone
I remember
Days inside your mind
The brave new mirror I would find
All is gone
The sea has left the sand
The sun has left the land
As helpless as my empty hand
All is gone
You are sunlight
In another dawn
A voice inside another song
All is goneEmbed
