I Saw the World LyricsI saw the world
Spinning like a toy
Hate seems so small
Compared to it all
So why don't you do joy
Hate is a chain
It all comes back again
Everything you do
Returns at last to you
So why don't you do love
Why must you stand
Holding your own hand
Why won't you see me
Why won't you help me
Why won't you love meEmbed
