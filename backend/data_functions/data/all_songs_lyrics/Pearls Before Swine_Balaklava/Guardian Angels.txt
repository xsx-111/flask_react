Guardian Angels LyricsYou know that your guardian angel is dead, you have said
You say in the world is not a safe world to be
For all of your trying and all of your crying it seems
It's raining outside umbrellas are harder to find
All of the pain in the world is outside your bed
In the shapes of phantom men tapping your window with rhythms of dread
And all of the silver rosaries hung on the door
Will not drive them away they are going to stay
You say that the sky people don't even ask you your name
If it's you or another, it doesn't matter, to them it's all the same
But we live suspended in each other's mind
A bullet-proof sanctuary cathedral of eyes
That I offer you that I offer you
You're trapped in a world of angels who no longer care
In the space where his hand was, my hand is reaching out for you there
Love is the weapon left after the fall
It may not seem like much but girl that's all that's there
Girl I love youEmbed
