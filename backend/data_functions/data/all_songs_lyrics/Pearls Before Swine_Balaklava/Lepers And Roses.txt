Lepers And Roses LyricsThe halo morning has dissolved
The day is gone
And nothing's solved
For you
The sand castles are merely sand
The sea has crawled back
From your hand
Too soon
In fields where Susan sings
The leopard brings
Yesterday
In upon a string
And all your dead rainbows
Begin to stain
The lace on your raincoat
So leave the blind
Roses behind
You
Orpheus takes you by the hand
Leads you into another land
Land without shade
Where trees are made
For you, Tiresias
Will try to find
A monument
To the death of eyes
So leave the blind
Roses behind
You
If you knew tomorrow was
Just yesterday
Hiding behind a mask
What would you ask?
What could you ask?
Alpha and Omega laugh
Behind a glass
Sell bootstraps from a bag
Nowhere to hide
The rest is a lie
So leave the blind
Roses behind
YouEmbed
