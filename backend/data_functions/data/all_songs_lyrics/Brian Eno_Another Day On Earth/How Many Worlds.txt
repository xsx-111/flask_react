How Many Worlds LyricsThinking of a world and the light of the sun
And all the many lives that were ever begun
Ever begun
Our little world turning in the blue
As each day goes there's another one new
Another one new
How many people will we feed today
How many lips will we kiss today
If we wake up?
How many worlds will we ever see
And how people can we ever be
If we wake up?
Thinking of a world in the light of the sun
And all the many lives that were ever begun
Ever begunEmbed
