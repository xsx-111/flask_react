Bottomliners LyricsGreat lines of numbers, all bright and shiny
All through the ether, some huge, some tiny
All though the ether from France to China
Unite the people, all bottomliners
Some brass, some paper, some gold, some silver
Some full of promise, some full of anger
In ranks of thousands, they fall and stumble
All bottomliners, we make the number
And in the future, new forms of romance
Grenade and landmine in twilit silence
With hands that tremble and lives that flounder
All bottomliners, all undergrounders
All undergrounders
All undergrounders
All undergroundersEmbed
