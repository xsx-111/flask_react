Under LyricsWhen all the worlds are lost in snow
I have to move this meaning through;
Disperse the force so far engendered
All near the steam and summer view
And then... remain
Where steeples crash in fire and thunder
Where sheets of steel obscure the land
Where word and sense are torn asunder:
Here was the place I chose to stand
Just when I think I'm going under
I... remain
Well all the waves of spin are foaming
And fake muezzin steam and brew
Formed in the fire of all their longings(?)
This is the way I took it through
Just when I think I'm going under
This is the way I thought it through;
This is the way I took it under...Embed
