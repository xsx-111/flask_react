Just Another Day LyricsOh it's just another day
It's just another day on Earth
Oh it's just another day
Just another day
It's just another day on Earth
Oh it's just another day on Earth
It's just another day on Earth
One day, we will put it all behind
We'll say, that was just another time
We'll say, that was just another day on Earth
We'll say, that was just another time
One day, we will put it all behind
We'll say, that was just another day on Earth
Just another day
It's just another day
Oh it's just another day on Earth
It's just another day on EarthEmbed
