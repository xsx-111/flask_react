Caught Between LyricsCaught between the Earth and the sky
What too long and what too high
Fallen free and holding on
Nothing there at all
Dropped and lifted, gotta breathe
Bottom drifting, on the way
Holding just a few poor words
And nothing at all
Reaching out to still the sand
No light connects the breaking moments
Drifting to another shore
There's nothing here that I could change at all
Nothing at all
Forced to be a broken line
Let to hold what we could find
Then to learn and go again
Nothing sorted out
High above, a single bird
It drifts about the dead volcano
Who's to lose and who's to find
There's nothing here that I could choose at all
Choose at allEmbed
