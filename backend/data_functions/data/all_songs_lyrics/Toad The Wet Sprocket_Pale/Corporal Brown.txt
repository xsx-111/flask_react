Corporal Brown LyricsCorporal brown was tall, boy!
And likes to go and fish
Corporals wife was quite fat
And was a raving bitch
And Im a bit drunk as I watch
They are yelling loud, he throws a punch
Oh lord, what am I gonna do?
Corporal brown was quite scared
When he looked down at her
Corporals wife was quite dead
So he carried her and took her outside
Dug a grave and placed her inside
I was amazed
Oh lord, what am I gonna do?Embed
