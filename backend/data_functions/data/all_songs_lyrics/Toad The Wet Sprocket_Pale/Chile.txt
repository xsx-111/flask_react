Chile LyricsBe who you are
If it fits in the system
Say what you want
But you might die if they listen
They think in the politics of gasoline and torture
Please only talk to me in the dark
Please only talk to me in the dark
Write what you will
If you write in a prison
Sing how you feel
But you might die if they listen
They think in the politics
Of rosaries and chains
And its hard to tell the right from the wrong
When the right is protecting the wrong
Be who you are
But not where there are people
Reality is taught
Right and wrong, there is no middle
We think in politics
Of money and ourselvesEmbed
