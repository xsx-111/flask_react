Nothing Is Alone LyricsSomething rushes over me
And I find myself standing here
Lift my eyes up to the sky
And offer a silent prayer
Sometimes all the shouting stops
And the restlessness loses hold
And I cry out to everything
That nothing is alone
If the winter won't turn me
Then the summer can't burn me
And the rain will never
Fall upon a restless soul
Nothing is aloneEmbed
