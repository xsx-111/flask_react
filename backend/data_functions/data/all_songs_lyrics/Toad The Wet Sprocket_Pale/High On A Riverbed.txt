High On A Riverbed LyricsWhy try
When everything I do feels half right?
I wander through my life
Everything I say seems half right
Sometimes I'm standing here
High on a riverbed
And light breaks through
And everything feels good for a while
High on a riverbed
Where am I
When everything I do feels half right?
How can I be satisfied
Writing words from someone else's lies?
Sometimes I'm standing here
High on a riverbed
And light breaks through
And everything feels good for a while
High on a riverbed
Light breaks through
I see myself sometimes
Vision is a mystery half blind
I keep missing all the time
Seeing what I could be if I...
If I...
Sometimes I'm standing here
High on a riverbed
And light breaks through
And everything feels good for a whileEmbed
