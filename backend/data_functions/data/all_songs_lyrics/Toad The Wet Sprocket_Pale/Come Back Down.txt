Come Back Down LyricsI've come here a thousand times, some things never change
"Yes I will, anything you say"
I've quit this a million times, can't quite stay away
Just one more time...I'll be ok
But i'm so damn tired
When I come back down
Though I'm crazy to
Anything you want from me I'll do
When I come back down
"Hey joe, could you spare a buck
I could use some food"
What a laugh, you're just one more fool
Two hours and it's back again, lapping at my heels
Stop yelling...I'll get through
But I'm so damn tired
When I come back down
Though I'm crazy to
Anything you want from me I'll do
When I come back down
When I come back down
When I come back down
I've come here a thousand times
Some things never change
Lay me down...take me away
Oh god, I'm so damn tired
When I come back down
Though I'm crazy to
Anything you want from me I'll do
When I come back down
Come back downEmbed
