Bad Man LyricsDem dread seh
Dem dread seh
Dem dread seh
Dem dread seh
No matter how you bad I man badder than you
No matter how you dread I man dreader than you
No matter how you hard I man harder than you
No matter how you raw
I more-weak heart back way so
A bad man no want go back Into captivity
A bad man no want go back to slavery
Uprising from the claws of the wicked
Two bulls can't reign in one pen
Two lions can't roar in a small den
Two scorpions don't sting at the same spot
Two guns can't fire the same bullet shot so
Move right out now
Move right out now
Move right out now
Move right out now
Two kings don't wear the same crown
Two beauties don't have the same gown on
Tomorrow Is too late to leave town
If you're still here at noon
There'll be one big, big, big showdown so
Uprising, uprising
Uprising, uprising
I give you tlil noon to go
On your way to survival,where
Your heart will beat more fonder
With life
And breath still enters your body
Repeat verse one
If you still coming me nah run
If you still coming, me ah go, drop you
If you still coming me nah run
So better stop running before I, break you
So run and hide before I, find you
Woe betide if I catch up on you
If you still coming I box you down
If you still coming I clart you down
Long time we deh under backraw...
Four hundred years (many, many years)
Slavery days...
Slavery days...
Slavery days...
Oh you've been bought
Oh you've been sold
Oh cast over me
Got strung up for nothing at all
Strange fruit...Embed
