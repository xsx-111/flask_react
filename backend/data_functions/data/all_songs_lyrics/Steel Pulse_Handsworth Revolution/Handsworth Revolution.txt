Handsworth Revolution LyricsI say the people of Handsworth, know that
One hand wash the other so they say
So let's join hands my bredren
Make the way for our children (our children, our children)
And their children (their children, their children)
Ensuring that they get life's fair share of...
Equality...
Doesn't justice stand for all
Doesn't justice stand for all
Doesn't justice stand for all mankind
We find society putting us down
Crowning us, crowning us, crowning us, crowning us
A place of Evil, OH, OH
Handsworth means us the Black People
Handsworth means us the Black People
We're taiklng now. Speaking Jah Jah language!
It's a long, long way we're coming from
To send this message across, across
Its been hidden, forbidden, concealed, unrevealed
Its got to come out In the open that -
BABYLON IS FALLING
BABYLON IS FALLING
It was foolish to build It on the sand
Handsworth shall stand, firm - like Jah rock
- fighting back
We once beggars are now choosers
No intention to be losers
Striving forward with ambition
And if it takes ammunition
We rebel in Handsworth revolution
Handsworth revolution
Handsworth yeah yeah revolution
Handsworth revolution
Revolution
Dread town, dread town, dread town
Dread town, dread town, dread town
Dread we are for a cause
Deprived of many things
Experienced phoney laws
Hatred Babylon brings
We know what we got to offer
We know what's going on
Don't want no favours
Cause there is still hunger
Innocent convicted
Poor wage, hard labour
Only Babylon prospers
And humble suffer
They are brothers in south of Africa
One Black represent all, all over the world
Can't bear it no longer
Blessed wlththe power
Of Jah Creator
We will get stronger
And we will conquer
And forward ever, and backward never
